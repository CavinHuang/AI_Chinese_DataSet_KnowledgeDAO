["Q: Operating Systems and RAM limitations of VirtualBox? My Laptop Specs : 8 GB RAM, 2 GB Graphics Card.\nHost Operating System : Ubuntu 14.04\nVirtualBox Version : 4.3.10\nGuest Operating Systems : Windows 7 (with 4GB RAM) & Kali Linux (with 3GB RAM).\nQueries :\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the maximum limit of Operating Systems that can be installed\non Virtual Box?\n\n*If i want to install another OS (with 4 GB RAM) in\nVirtual Box, will it effect my Host OS performance ? If so, please\nsuggest the good solution.\n\n*What will be my Host OS performance after\ninstalling two or more OS in VirtualBox.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*There is no maximum limit of OSs that can be installed in VirtualBox.\n\n*Since all virtual machines are separate from each other, there will be no effect on host OS performance if you install another OS in VirtualBox unless both guest OSs are running at the same time.\n\n*With 8GB of RAM there should be minimal or no effect on host OS performance after installing two or more OS in VirtualBox, unless you are running multiple guest OSs at the same time.\n\nOther considerations related to performance of the guest OS in VirtualBox\n\n\n*\n\n*Your guest OS's performance will be better if your guest OS has a lightweight desktop environment. For example, Xubuntu has better performance in VirtualBox than Ubuntu. Disable the Aero desktop experience in the Windows 7 guest OS. Fancy desktop effects use more RAM, which is a limited resource that you can't afford to waste.\n\n*Your guest OS's performance will be better if you give the guest OS enough RAM. 2GB of RAM should be enough give the guest OS good performance under normal circumstances.  \n\n*A virtual machine installed on an SSD has better performance than a virtual machine installed on an ordinary spinning disk HDD.\n\n*VirtualBox is frequently updated and occasionally there are small changes in the VirtualBox GUI. If you are following instructions from a tutorial about how to install a guest OS in VirtualBox, make sure that the tutorial is a recent one.\n", "Q: No Grub menu on boot. windows's blue screen with error code0x0000225 \n*\n\n*ITs LONG BUT PLEASE READ!!\n\n\n\nI recently got rid of windows8.1 and installed ubuntu 14.04lts.(in c partition and i have kept all my other ntfs partitions untouched) which was successful and i had the grub2 menu on boot. as i wanted to dual boot it with kali ,i installed kali in other partition and after installing on restart the boot ran into \"windows's blue screen with error code0x0000225\" I ran boot repair in ubuntu live cd it was succesful!.\n-\nHowever i had many annoying windows' entries in my grub so i searched for it and followed an article's instructions to clean up grub menu(I cant remember which article it was! and im not able to find it again now!) it said something about commenting out the unwanted entries by prefixing \"#\" which i did. and after restarting I've lost my grub menu now and am back to \"windows's blue screen with error code0x0000225!!\"\n but the funny thing is when i go into \"booting options (f9) i get an option named \"Ubuntu(WDC XXXXXXX)\" and when i click on it i get the grub2 manu back again!! and i'm able to boot into both! however on restart i get back to blue error screen!\nSo the problem here is i'm not getting the grub on boot! Please help!! \n THANKS A TON FOR READING THIS!! \n\nA: The problem seems to be with boot priority in bios. To correct this problem open bios and probably you will get windows 8.1 on top priority, change it to your desired operating system ie Ubuntu .\n", "Q: Where is the location of packages cached by apt-cacher? When you install something by sudo apt-get install <packageName>, the packages are saved in /var/cache/apt/archives by default. I have installed and configured apt-cacher. I want to know where the packages cached by apt-cacher are stored? Are they saved in /var/cache/apt/archives? If so how is it possible to change the cache directory?\n\nA: Default location where apt-cacher stores its packages is /var/cache/apt-cacher .\nIf you want to change it, you need to run the usr/share/apt-cacher/install.pl script.\nFrom man apt-cacher\n Universal Options\n       cache_dir [/var/cache/apt-cacher]\n              The directory where apt-cacher will store local  copies  of  all\n              packages  requested.  This  can  grow to many hundreds of MB, so\n              make sure it is on a partition with plenty of  room.  NOTE:  the\n              cache directory needs to contain some subdirectories for correct\n              storage management.  If you try to create  a  custom  directory,\n              please  use  the  script /usr/share/apt-cacher/install.pl or use\n              the initially created cache directory as example.\n\n", "Q: Making a dual boot from two single boots I have a laptop which I have two different HDs (SATA-II 2.5\"), one for Vista (i know) and the for Ubuntu 14.04.\nOrdinarily, I actually swap over the drives in the laptop's internal bay when I want switch systems. It was a way of giving me guaranteed integrity of the Vista system.\nI now have a caddy that meanns I could - if it were possible - run them as a dual boot.\nMy question: Is it possible to make a dual boot from this configuration? And, can I put either into the internal bay, or is it going to have to be vista?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: But of course! You will need some special tweaking, though.\nIf you have a uEFI system, simply install something like rEFInd. It will allow you to choose whether to boot into vista or Ubuntu. Don't hotswap drives, though. Keep one in the caddy, and make sure it stays there.\nIf you have Legacy BIOS, it gets a bit trickier. You need to go into your BIOS settings and figure out how to select a one-time boot device. Once you have found that, place the Vista hard drive in your PC, and the Ubuntu drive in the caddy. Use BIOS to select the specific drive, and voila!\n\nThe reason I had you stay away from GRUB is because it'll not find what it wants (Linux) if the Windows drive is internal. Conversely, Windows won't work too well if it's not internal. It's very picky about hardware...\n", "Q: \"-k\" option for \"ls -l\" commnad I can not use \"-k\" option for ls -l commnad. \n   -k, --kibibytes\n          use 1024-byte blocks\n\nThere is an option explanation in man ls like above.\nSo I guess that this option is valid.\nHowever, there is no difference of output between ls -l and ls -lk.\nCould anyone teach me how to validate \"-k\" option?\n\nA: Older versions of ls(1) have a different description of the -k option, which I find more accurate:\n\n-k     like --block-size=1K\n\n--block-size=SIZE\n          scale   sizes   by   SIZE   before   printing    them.     E.g.,\n          `--block-size=M'  prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes.  See\n          SIZE format below.\n\n\nThat means -k will lead to ls displaying all file sizes divided by 1024. This may be overridden by other (implicit) options like -h (which displays file sizes “human readable”, i. e. scaled depending on their size and with a scale suffix (K, M, G, T, …)).\nYou can determine, whether ls is an alias with default command line arguments with alias ls. You can circumvent the alias and run the command directly with command ls -l.\n", "Q: xen hypervisor wont boot from grub and \"Can't find hypervisor information in sysfs!\" error ubuntu 14.04 I have used This forum, trying to run xen on my os:\nsteps i have done :\negrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo\n\nouput = 4 and also i have run KVM virtualization with no problem.\nthen:\nsudo apt-get install xen-hypervisor-4.4-amd64 xen-utils-4.4 xenwatch xen-tools xen-utils-common xenstore-utils virtinst virt-viewer virt-manager \n\nthen opened a console : Ctrl + Alt + F1 and :\nsudo nano /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp\n\nand appended to the last of the file these lines:\n>     (xend-http-server yes)\n>     (xend-unix-server yes)\n\nskipped the network part coz i will manage them when every thing is right by bridge control utility .\nthen\nln -sf /usr/lib/xen-4.1 /usr/lib64/xen\n\ndid reboot\nin my ubuntu when i loaded booted after restart, whenever i insert this terminal code:\nxm dmesg\n\ni get the error of\n\nERROR:  Can't find hypervisor information in sysfs!\n\nin that forum and alot searches of google it says to configure the /etc/grub.d .\ni did these steps for:\nattempt 1:\nsudo mv /etc/grub.d/10_linux /etc/grub.d/50_linux\nupdate-grub2\n\nattempt 2:\ndpkg-divert --divert /etc/grub.d/08_linux_xen --rename /etc/grub.d/20_linux_xen\nupdate-grub\n\nAttempt 3:\nmv /etc/grub.d/10_linux /etc/grub.d/20_linux && mv /etc/grub.d/20_linux_xen /etc/grub.d/10_linux_xen\n\nbut even with that it gives the same error.\nwhen i try to boot from xen hypervisro which has appeared in boot grub loader, no matter what kind of xen hypervisor boot loader i select, system goes plank (or purple color of ubuntu default color) and never starts.\nis there any particular solution?\nP.S:\n\nUbuntu 14.04, AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5430/5450/5470 display ,4GB ram ,i3-370M -\n  2.40GHz cpu\n\n\nA: Although the community wiki states that as of Ubuntu 14.04, GRUB will automatically choose to boot Xen first if Xen is installed, it doesn't if you don't run Ubuntu (16.04) in English.\nTo be able to select the right kernel at boot open /etc/default/grub\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nand comment out the following 2 lines by putting a # in front of it and set GRUB_TIMEOUT to let's say 5\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=5\n\nnext update Grub and reboot\nsudo update-grub\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nYou should now be able to to select the right kernel in the grub menu and boot your system with Xen enabled.

I've asked this on StackExchange (i) Networking and (ii) Linux and gotten no answers, (iii) and also tried Reddit.\n\nA: Bridging is for adding/combining segments to a network. When you bridge two network interfaces, what you are doing is allowing network broadcasts to reach all of the nodes. Bridging would not apply to what you are trying to do.\nFor the router to function, here is a basic reference:\ncheck ip forwarding status for routing:\n   sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward  \nset (enable) ip forwarding status for routing:\n   echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  \nunset (disable) ip forwarding status for routing:\n   echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  \nAfter you have verified that ip forwarding is enabled, you can use iptables on the public interface, the network interface with the physical internet connection, as a NAT interface.\nI won't attempt a comprehensive explanation of NAT here, but this is a basic example:\necho 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE\n/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth2 -m state --state   RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth2 -o eth1 -j ACCEPT  \nyou can see the nat like so:\n   sudo iptables -L -t nat  \n\nA: I think you should use iptables to connect the two interfaces.\nAccording to this http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/newbie/186273-iptables-forwarding-vs-ip-route-post877996.html#post877996\nThe router's gateway should be the 192.168.1.7, to allow ip packets destinated out of the subnet to be sent to eth2. iptables should handles it from there and forwards it to eth1.\nHere's an answer to a similar question detailing the iptables forwarding rules.\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/431593/iptables-forwarding-between-two-interface\n", "Q: Problem removing swap partition I have a SanDisk SSD U100 124GB. \nWhen I installed Ubuntu 14.04 I partitioned as:\n- 250mb boot;\n - 4gb swap;\n - the rest ext4.\nSome times later, I removed the swap partition in order to merge it with the big one since I do not need it.

You can unmount it and run:\nsudo mkswap /dev/ubuntu-vg/swap_1\nsudo swapon -a\n\nWhat Ubuntu did here is presumably this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a 250 MB /boot primary partition.\n\n*Created an extended partition for the rest of the partitions. \n\n*Created an LVM volume within the above extended partition.\n\n*Created your root and swap partitions within the LVM volume.\n\n\n(That's why you have both sda2 and sda5.

I will create an additional question regarding this issue \n\nA: To fix installing the SDK first install ubuntu-sdk-libs-dev\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-sdk-libs-dev\n\nThen install the sdk:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-sdk\n\n", "Q: Set graphics to only use one third of a screen are here some hardcore users like that to be able to help me with my broken screen, where only the left third of a screen works?\nI use an external monitor most of the time, but it would be really nice to be able to use the rest of my integrated screen here. I guess it will go with some one-liner..? But I have no idea where to start here, Google didn't give me anything useful.\nOriginally the resolution was HD, ie. 1366x768 px.\n\nA: This answer by Tim Kennedy on Unix & Linux seems solid.\n\nCheck out: http://howto-pages.org/ModeLines/ , they have a good\n  explanation of Xorg modelines.  Then go to\n  http://xtiming.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/xtiming.pl and input the specs\n  for the size of the screen that you can use.  This will give you a\n  Modeline that you can add to your xorg.conf file.  \nFields 4, 5, 6, & 7 correspond to the following valudes:  HDisplay\n  HSyncStart HSyncEnd HTotal.\nBy playing with fields 5 & 6, you'll be able to move the visible\n  portion of your screen either left or right, depending on which you\n  need.\n\nIt seems to not apply to the TTYs though.\n", "Q: Extract here option and Source code for Thunar File manager Please anyone can paste me the source code for Extract Here option in Thunar File Manager.\nAny type of script i.e Python OR Shell Script OR PHP is OK.\nPlease help me\n\nA: You need to install thunar-archive-plugin to use Extract Here option.\nInstall it using \n sudo apt-get install thunar-archive-plugin \n\nOnce installed, you can find this option in Right click context menu.\nIf you want to use some custom action in your thunar menu, you can see here for how to configure this.\n\nA: As helpful as the current top answer is, it doesn't actually answer the original question, so for whoever's looking for the source code, here's the answer to that.\nThe plugin is written in C. The source code can be found here:\nhttps://git.xfce.org/thunar-plugins/thunar-archive-plugin\nGithub mirror:\nhttps://github.com/xfce-mirror/thunar-archive-plugin\n", "Q: X1 Carbon Mini Display works with External Monitor but not Projectors I have an X1 Carbon 2014 model, and everything seems to work great on Ubuntu 14.04. Recently now I've had to use it twice to give a presentation, and both times it's failed to detect the VGA projector. I've used it at home with both a VGA and a DVI monitor and it works fine. I'm using the Apple VGA and DVI mini displayport adapters, which I've used for years on an old Dell with MiniDP and now with the X1 Carbon.\nWhen it comes to projectors though, the laptop refuses to even acknowledge that the projector is there. I can plug it straight into a monitor with the same adapter and it works fine. \nI'm kind of at a loss as to what to do. \n\nA: I had the same problem. I also tried it with a Mac adapter, which I luckily borrowed from a friend, which did work for displays but not projectors. Due to this fact, I then bought a Lenovo adapter, which works fine. All under Linux, don't have a Windows installation any more.\n", "Q: Wanting to update my OLD video card for working with blender and games I'm using Xubuntu 14.04 on my desktop pc. It is quite good for all my needs except gaming and blender3d due to an outdated graphics card. The issue is not the quality of the card, but its openGL version. It is limited to openGL 2.2, and the blender3D and the games I want to play (Team Fortress 2) need openGL 3.\nAs such I'm thinking of update my graphics card, not something high end, to support super high graphics settings... so I was looking for nvidia 750 gtx (http://www.clickplus.pt/p70169), an older card, so its not only cheaper but maybe better driver support.\nMy main issue is... can I 'simply' pop the old card out and pop the new one in with my current hardware and linux drivers installed? If not, what should I do?

Sometimes the charger falls out without me knowing, making the computer shut off unexpectedly.\nIs there a way to get a notification the moment my charger falls out? not when battery needs to be charged like Ubuntu is used to do(Because that doesn't work for my laptop, and I've given up that idea)\n\nA: Simple linear command:\n[[ $(acpi -b | grep -o \"Discharging\") ]] && notify-send \"Alert\" \"Battery is not charging.\\n Please plug your AC adapter!\"\n\n\nFrom man acpi we have:\nNAME\n       acpi - Shows battery status and other ACPI information    \nSYNOPSIS\n       acpi [options]    \nDESCRIPTION\n       acpi Shows information from the /proc or the /sys filesystem, such as battery status or thermal information.    \nOPTIONS\n       -b | --battery\n                 show battery information\n\n\nIf you run acpi -b and you battery is charging mode, you will get this result of that:\nBattery 0: Charging, 88%, 00:38:17 until charged\n\nAnd if your battery isn't charging then the result would be like this:\nBattery 0: Discharging, 87%, 03:46:06 remaining\n\nThen We are looking \"Discharging\" in the result with this command:\nacpi -b | grep -o \"Discharging\"\n\nIf battery was not in charging the result will \"Discharging\".\nAnd finally we send an alert to notification if we got \"Discharging\" from above command:\n[[ $(acpi -b | grep -o \"Discharging\") ]] && notify-send \"Alert\" \"Battery is not charging.\\n Please plug your AC adapter!\"\n\nNote: [[ Something ]] always true and [[ ! Something ]] always false.\nNow it's easiest way that we run it in the background, inside a while loop. Then I put the command into a while loop and I check the battery status between X interval of time. Like this:\nwhile true\n do\n    # Our command\n    sleep [number of seconds] # check the status every [number of seconds] seconds\n done\n\nAnd if you want to run the script on startup and every 5 minutes, so the construction would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the script(I named it ChkCharge.sh in my home directory)\n\n*Add a line in /etc/rc.local to call your script (your ChkCharge.sh) + \"&\" to make it exit. like bash /home/USERNAME/ChkCharge.sh &.\n\n\n\nFinal Script\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true\ndo\n    [[ $(acpi -b | grep -o \"Discharging\") ]] && notify-send \"Alert\" \"Battery is not charging.\\n Please plug your AC adapter!\"\n    sleep 300 # 300 seconds or 5 minutes\ndone\n\nFinish. Reboot and see the magic ;)\n\nA: This looks pretty simple, I'm not a bash script expert, but maybe could be useful for you\n# sh script.sh\n\nThe script.sh content:\n#! /bin/bash\n\npower=$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/status)\n\nwhile true; do\n  actual=$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/status)\n\n  if [ $actual != $power ]; then\n     power=$actual\n     notify-send $actual\n  fi\ndone\n\nBasically, I'm reading a file at sysfs that has information about your battery, there are more information in there that could be interesting. The file status contains a flag indicating if your device is actually Charging or Discharging. Hope that helps you.\n", "Q: Cant install kubuntu My lenovo ideapad came with a dos operating system.

The driver for it is far from perfect, so I was looking for alternative drivers, and found this: https://github.com/FreedomBen/rtl8188ce-linux-driver It seemed pretty safe to try as it automatically backs an old driver up, so I went for it. Installation went smoothly without any troubles, but after rebooting there was no wireless option in NM at all. So I decided to get back to kernel driver, and tried both options of getting it back that were mentioned in readme to that driver: restoring the backup with the provided script and reinstalling the original driver with \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-extra-$(uname -r)\n\nTried rebooting after doing that.\nBut neither of those ways helped, and now I have no wireless. ifconfig doesn't show wlan0 interface.\nI guess I am missing something trivial as the original driver has to be in place now, would really appreciate your help.\nI am running Ubuntu 14.04 with all updates.\n\nA: Compiling this driver helped: https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new\nmake \nsudo make install\n\n", "Q: Additional Drivers not showing I recently installed Ubuntu GNOME 14.04.1 on my new laptop with an Ralink RT3290 wireless device and an  NVIDIA GeForce 820m graphics card. My problem is that the drivers to none of these devices are shown in the additional devices. Might I have installed things wrong or is this a bug in the distro or anything else? I have been able to install nvidia drivers by CLI, and WiFi is also working, but should I be worried that none of them are showing in the application?\n\nA: The Additional Drivers tool in Ubuntu only shows devices, for which there is a proprietary driver, i.e. a driver, which source code is kept secret by its producer.\nThis tool doesn't show drivers that you installed manually, but proprietary drivers that are available, and lets you choose from them.\n\nFor your RT3290 (I got the same), there is no proprietary driver. There is an open source driver on their website, but it only works for older Linux versions. So your best (and in my experience not bad) chance is to keep the preinstalled rt2800pci driver and keep using it as a default.\nIf you, like me, got the version with Bluetooth, don't even try. The module you'd need is called rtbth. After applying various patches, I managed to set it up in DKMS, only to learn that the driver doesn't work properly. You can find Bluetooth devices and they can find you, but you can't pair with them. So if you need Bluetooth, get a Bluetooth USB Dongle, like I did.\n\nNow to your Graphics Card: There certainly IS a proprietary driver for most nVidia chips. It is indeed strange that the card doesn't show up. As you pointed out, it bay be a bug, that the combination of your card and the proprietary nVidia driver is not detected automatically, and is therefore not shown.\n", "Q: Change manual page option color I see the man page options very dark.

I've no problem mounting the folders and they have the correct permissions set in Windows. I'm mounting them using the following\nsudo mount.cifs '//WINDOWS_MACHINE/WINDOWS_FOLDER' /mnt/windows_folder/ \n-o uid-1000,gid=1000,username=$USRN,password=$PASS\n\n\nA: You appear to have a typo in one of the -o options you're passing to mount.cifs. Your goal seems to be to mount the share so its files are treated as being owned by the user whose UID is 1000 and the group whose GID is 1000.\ngid=1000 is correct, but you have uid-1000. You should have uid=1000 instead (i.e., you have a - where you should have a =).\nI don't know if that's the only problem, but assuming the text shown in your question is what you're using, that may explain why it's not working.\nIf there is not also a separate problem on the server side (which, if the share is accessible from other Windows machines with the same username and password, there probably is not), then it's likely that fix alone will resolve your problem.\nThat's the only actual error I've noticed, but I'll mention a mistake that's often made: Sometimes people specify their Ubuntu username and password with username= and password=. These should instead be the appropriate username and password for the Windows system that you're connecting to. (Sometimes these might be the same as your Ubuntu username and password, but only if you've deliberately set them the same on both systems.)\nBy the way, you might consider specifying the password interactively rather than on the command-line (so it doesn't go into your history). If you omit the password= option entirely, you should be prompted for a password to access the share. (This will be separate from the sudo password prompt.)\n\nA: Use forceuid,forcegid,file_mode=MODE and dir_mode=MODE to explicitly control the permissions of the mounted filesystem if you have problems. Usually you don't need to set all of these unless you are using it with a certain other user (like mounting as root then using it as UID/GID=1000 in your case, you can force it to allow you (UID 1000) to be the owner of the items, hope that helps.\nJust a note: Also, Windows shares are denoted with a double backslash \\ not forward slash. Mount.cifs does reverse them but its a habit that can give you trouble later. Don't forget to pass 'rw' option for writing the filesystem and, make sure you use a user/passoword that has write permissions on the windows side. \n", "Q: Nautilus Scripts - Select every second file Is it possible to write a script to select every second file\nI found something similar \nhttp://g-scripts.sourceforge.net/cat-filesysmgt.php\nbut it's been taken off line. \nI create numerous routine backups, after a while it's no use keeping all of them, halving them by selecting every second one would be useful.\nUsing Nautilus 3.4 the one from Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Perhaps it would be wiser to move the files to a Trash folder rather than to delete them altogether.You can achieve this by selecting script from nautilus context menu. I can't tell what script you are referring to, but this one will do just fine.\nSo, create the script, make it executable and place it in the nautilus script folder.\n#!/bin/bash\ncomm_susbst=$(echo \"$NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS\")\nfiles_del=$(echo \"$comm_susbst\" | sed -n 'n;p')\nnum_files=$(echo \"$files_del\" | wc -l)\nzenity --question --title=\"Delete every second file\" \\\n--text=\"Are you sure you want to delete these files? \\n You will delete $num_files files! \\n\\n $files_del\"\n    if [ $? == 0 ]; then\n        echo \"$files_del\" | while read; do mv -t /home/$USER/.local/share/Trash/files \"$REPLY\"; sleep 0.1; done\n    else exit 1\n    fi\nexit 0\n\nAfter selecting files and running a script zenity window will pop-up for confirmation.If you insist on deleting files than replace the mv line with do rm -f \"$REPLY\".

It will also match folders with modification timestamps in the last day that were created earlier, but you probably don't have many such folders whose exact name is app.\nWhen a file was created is not typically stored in the filesystem. But the time at which its metadata were last changed (e.g., name/location, ownership, permissions) is stored.

My problems related to the use of mac addresses and I would point you to the link above and Intel Wireless Wifi Link 5100 on Trusty Tahr not working\n14.04 forced me rethink my network security (after a few years) and in particular the use of mac addresses as they can be cloned now days.\nBelow is an extract of the security policy (link at top)\n**No Open Ports\nDefault installations of Ubuntu must have no listening network services after initial install. Exceptions to this rule include network infrastructure services such as the DHCP client and mDNS (Avahi/ZeroConf, see ZeroConfPolicySpec for implementation details and justification). When installing Ubuntu Server, the administrator can, of course, select specific services to install beyond the defaults (e.g. Apache).\nTesting for this can be done with netstat -an --inet | grep LISTEN | grep -v 127.0.0.1: on a fresh install.** \nI hope this helps with your quest.\nregards  \n\nA: I should clarify my previous post and the use of mac addresses. I was using 'mac add' over the top of wap, and i did the the most obvious first and turned off the filtering, and just had wap still with no joy. That would almost sound like your situation where your hardware is seen, DHCP etc and everything else set to auto. I'm no guru but some of the security mixes (wifi) still use mac addresses as part of the encryption key makeup (highly recommended reading for a drug free way of getting to sleep).\ntry this one liner which lists the wifi networks available from your machine.\nsudo iwlist wlan0 scan     \nif you can see your router, I would suggest looking at your security arrangements. \nif you get a message that looks like this:-\nwlan0     Interface doesn't support scanning : Network is down\nYour wifi is disabled \"turned off\". Then try this\nsudo NetworkManager start\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\nWhere NetworkManager operates on the service and ifconfig operates on the interface wlanX, ethX\nTo help you confirm your settings try:-\niwconfig\nYou can find descriptions of these via the man pages.\nGood luck with your diagnosis.\n", "Q: apt- Error installing Deepin Desktop Environment in Ubuntu 14.04 I have been trying to add the Deepin Desktop Environment to Ubuntu.

Are the ports open, but just not showing as open?  Is it because nmap is missing their status due to Ubuntu denying it the ability to see that they are open since nothing is listening? \n\nA: A port is just a number that is part of an TCP address. If a program is waiting for incoming connections (\"listening\") on that port the port is called \"open\", otherwise it's \"closed\". \nThe kernel may filter traffic to a port to make it \"closed\" for some or all remote addresses. You can configure this filter e.g. by using ufw.\nSo ufw can't open a port, it can just tell the kernel to filter or not filter traffic for a given port.\nYou only told ufw not to filter the given ports (that is the default). You still need some programs to listen on that ports to make them \"open\".\n", "Q: Network manager start access point I have a pcDuino and I need to start a access point using network-manager.

However, my computer has some corrupted system files on it when I bought it, so I took it into a local store to have them look at it. They re-installed windows 8.1. Its all been working fine, until I went to install Ubuntu. I cannot access my UEFI firmware settings menu to turn off secure boot. So i tried changing my boot mode, through BIOS, to UEFI from Legacy. This worked! Ubuntu booted up and I started the install process but when I got to the part where I tell it what partition on my hard drive to put it on, it shows one partition of my whole hard drive with the full terabyte available for storage. And that's not the case, there should be 3. My windows system reserved partition, my main windows partition, and the 85 gigabyte partition I made for Ubuntu.\nI change my boot mode to UEFI and turn off secure boot, install Ubuntu, and then go back and install windows. This makes me uneasy though as I'm not sure everything would work.\nThe main issue that I've figured out, cause I posted over at reddit too, is that the partitions cant be seen by the installer and I don't want to only run Ubuntu\n\nA: Go to disk management in windows and check for that extra storage place and if not of use then format it. After that you can proceed to installation.\nIf the problem persists please provide better insight to problem by errors prompted snaps, snapshot of the disk management from windows and fdisk command from live CD ubuntu.\n\nA: Try booting into your live CD and selecting \"try\" instead of install.

You should be able to see all the partitions currently on your hard drive. \nWithin the installer, at one point on the screen where it asks if you want to install Ubuntu in addition to or over your old operation system. On that same screen you should be able to click \"advanced options\" which will show you all the partitions currently on your HD and allow you to make new ones. In order to install Ubuntu you actually need two new partitions, the main partition which should be ext4 of whatever size you want and the swap partition which is just called swap and should generally be the same size as the amount of RAM in your computer.\n\nA: You can use the Wubi Method Of Installation for installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 8/8.1.

If you could tell me what I'm doing wrong (or let me know what other information I need to include), I would appreciate it.\n\nA: The documentation lacks a basic explanation.\nLet's have a look first at your error. You create an instance of the PDiffer class and then trie to call that instance again. See this very simplified example with the same error:\n>>> class PDiffer:\n...   def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n...     pass\n... \n>>> pdiff = PDiffer(bin=\"/path/to/bin\")\n>>> pdiff(\"image1.png\", \"image2.png\")\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: 'PDiffer' object is not callable\n\nThat said, the documentation gives 2 options to use pdiff.\nCreate an instance of PDiff and give it a custom path to the binary or use the helper function pdiff. Giving them the same variable name and using them in the same code block is just very confusing. It's either one OR the other.\nI had to look at the source to see what's going on. You should use the pdiff method of the PDiff class instead. The second example is a shortcut to this method with the custom binary path.\nSo a working example would be:\nfrom pdiffer import PDiffer\npdiff = PDiffer(bin='/home/username/Documents/pdiff/perceptualdiff')\nresult = pdiff.pdiff('image1.png', 'image2.png')\n\n", "Q: Error while deploying HTML5 app with Ubuntu SDK I got this error message while deploying a HTML5 app with UbuntuSDK.

away 32Gb so that the free space is for a full installation (alongside the pre-installed Windows 8.1).\nI've recently installed Lubuntu on this space but decided to go for Ubuntu Desktop instead. (After I cleared the space from the Lubuntu install, grub 2 is still on the computer somehow even though I installed it to a partition that is now gone). Creepy but hopefully not problematic.\nI'm curious about sizing the partitions I'll be making in the advanced install method. Specifically, /, /home, and swap-area.\nDo I even need swap? I have 4Gb RAM. Also I heard somewhere that making a separate /home partition is good if dual-booting (which I will be, between just Ubuntu and Windows 8.1). Is that true?\n\nA: Having a swap area is always a good idea. In short, it's good for memory-consuming programs, as well as hibernation and memory optimization. You should see the \"Why do I need swap?\" part of the SwapFaq for a more detailed explanation.\nAs for splitting up the partition - I don't know of any benefit for booting, but it is a good approach. The reason for that is that in case anything goes wrong - you can always just format and re-install Ubuntu cleanly withouth losing any of your actual data - you just format the root / and re-point /home to the home partition.\nI can account that this setup saved me once (even though the initial screw-up was my fault). However, with only 32GB I wouldn't recommend it, as the system partition should have at least 20-25GB of free space on its own.\n", "Q: system gets started after shutdown I have Acer v5-571, which get started again after shutdown .After installing laptop mode tools the problem got solved but now also when I use a USB mouse then the problem comes till I do shutdown again.\n\nA: try this in terminal  \nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nthis shutdowns the system i.e. halts the system.\nfor more please check  man help in terminal \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1 and unmet dependencies for ubuntu sdk.

When finished, run this command:\n   sudo reboot\n\nAll these commands depend on your Internet connection being up and running. If you don't have a Internet connection, you should run this command before all of the others mentioned above:\n   sudo pppoeconf\n\nand follow the setup to the end so you have a working internet connection in the textmode console.

Though you may think at a first glance that the post deals with some bug specific to Lubuntu 13.10, read ahead on that page to find out that the same bug applies to Lubuntu 14.04 too.\nIt is the reason I urged you to use the xfce session instead of the lxde session which may be good for desktop computers but it is not that good for laptops.\nTo be able to use xfce4-power-manager full features in Lubuntu, you need to, and I quote from that page:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*You can go to ---> Menu > Preferences > default application for LXsession > Power Manager > Other > xfce4-power-manager > Apply >\n  Reboot.\n  \n  \n  HOWEVER, please note that this is not enough and this feature should\n  be loaded by default, just like it used to be.\n\n  \n*Another solution is to open Preferences --> Default applications for LXSession, then go to the autostart tab and here change the option\n  \"Disable autostarted applications\" from the default \"config-only\" to\n  \"no\". You may need to change the settings for laptop-mode from \"no\"to\n  \"yes\". (settings tab).\n  \n  \n  Note that you need to disable \"network\" from Prefereces-->Desktop\n  Session Settings or you will have two nm-applet running at the same\n  time.\n\nThere are other unofficial workarounds designed for xfce power manager to work in Lubuntu, and you can check the answers too just to find another good link to this page where you can find yet another 'working solution' for your problem:\n\n\n  \n*I had this problem, i unchecked \"Power Manager\" from \"Application Autostart\" list in Settings -> Session and Startup and added another\n  application with this command xfce4-power-manager --no-daemon then i\n  have not have this problem yet.\n  \n\n", "Q: Change text in many files I have a C++ project, where each file has at its beginning some lines of license.

I've been using windows 7 on my HP Pavilion G6 for quite a while now, I've always wanted to install Ubuntu and have all the files on my USB Flash Drive after using Universal USB installer. My USB is a Cruzer Edge 4gb, and I just want to know the chances of it breaking (there is also no boot from usb option)\nEDIT: Not sure if this is a problem, but I've installed it on virtualbox and it's really, really, really laggy.\n\nA: *\n\n*The chances of Ubuntu damaging your computer hardware are negligible.\n\n*You can choose to “Try Ubuntu” before installing it. That way you can discover and research possible hardware driver issues.\n\n*What you should consider is the risk, that you accidentally delete your data while repartitioning¹ your drive(s) for an additional operating system. Stick to the installation instructions or other reliable² advice³, be careful, and back up your data!\nThe performance of virtual machines cannot be compared reasonably to that of natively running software. They're known to have poor (graphics) performance without proper configuration.\n¹ Can be done with during installation. The installer will assist you. For details see the answers linked at ² and ³.\n² for legacy BIOS\n³ for UEFI BIOS\n\nA: The Ubuntu installer is a robust piece of software, breaking thing with that is hard.\nThe \"installer\" has an \"try ubuntu\" option where an ubuntu experience is loaded directly in the RAM leaving the hdd untouched, and thus reducing the chance of breaking things to zero. This is a very useful and foolproof way of getting familiar with Ubuntu/linux, and you can always decide to get back to ol-Windows later. \nSo in short:\nthe installers chance of bricking your PC = tiny\nthe \"try ubuntu\" option chance of bricking your pc = zero\n\nA: It's not surprising your seeing things are laggy with VirtualBox. You're sharing resources between Windows and Ubuntu.

The solution is to boot to USB and NOT UEFI from boot option menu.  Leave the internal hard disks as first bootable options in BIOS, use F-Key at bootup to enter boot option menu.  The admin will have to go through all the steps again to install, even erase partitions and redo as there is a glitch between UEFI and USB boot modes which will cause problems later.  The interface should look slightly different, which will be obvious.  \nThe Ubuntu Server documentation for installing the RAID is a bit confusing if someone is not familiar with it, so this will clarify that portion if running two internal disks on server.  Here's the major steps:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Configure the first hard disk partitions, assigning space for /boot, /, swap, /var, and etc... as necessary.  Sizes vary on requirements but here is the down and dirty:  /boot= 300-500MB (GRUB INSTALLED HERE); /root=15-50GB (Large enough to hold admin files, updates/packages); swap= twice ram size; /var= the remainder if hosting web server (ex: /var/www/). \n\n*Set all file types as you go for each partition to the ......RAID... option and select finish then continue creating additional partitions until first disk is completed.\n\n*Do the SAME EXACT things for second hard disk.\n\n*Above both disk partition areas is a Configure RAID option, so select it.\n\n*SELECT RAID option, in this case RAID 1, leave default to 2 disks followed by 0 extra disks.\n\n*Check the box for the first partition on first hard disk and then check the first partition on second hard disk, then select continue.  Repeat this for every partition until there are no more available options to link partitions of hard disk one and hard disk two.  BE SURE NOT TO SELECT YOUR USB as it is in the available options, just ignore it as if it were not there. \n\n*VERY IMPORTANT STEP... Above both disk partition areas but beneath Configure RAID option is an area that lists each \"linked\" partition for disk one and two. Select each RAID partition option on the screen and assign a file system, such as EXT4, swap area, and soforth for each RAID partition.  You can even assign a name if you'd like to make it easier to differentiate the partitions, such as boot, root, var, swap, etc.  Set boot flag on for /boot and / and leave all others off. The flag on/off is located beneath file system selection [EXT4, swap, etc] for each RAIDed partition. Some BIOS require it and will not work if not selected while others do not require it.  Once completed then write changes to disk.\n\n*Continue through some other steps and when it gets to GRUB boot loader it will install as it should, so long as appropriate file system type was appropriately selected in Step 7.\n\n*Install your desired packages for what server will be used for, such as LAMP, MAIL, DNS, FILE SERVER (OPENSSH), etc...\nHope this helps someone else so they do not have to figure it out the painful, smashing face on keyboard for an entire day.\n-SierraJuliet\n", "Q: GRUB fails to load Windows in \"dual-boot\" with ubuntu I've just installed Ubuntu from live DVD in my external HD to try it before using it in dual boot with windows 8.

I am trying to understand what Ubuntu's airplane mode is, not in concept but in implementation. Aside from the visual indication of it in the GUI, exactly how is this state defined? Is it defined simply as all rfkill-managed RF devices being soft blocked at the same time or is that coincidental to an airplane mode state variable saved elsewhere? I know about Network Manager's /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state file, but there's nothing in there about airplane mode and I haven't found any other state file yet.\n\nA: from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FlightMode\n\nFlight Mode ( aka \"Airplane Mode\" ) is a global control that can be used to turn all transmitting-capable radios on the system off at one time. In the case of a phone, this can include:\nWi-Fi\n  Bluetooth\n  C>ellular\n  NFC\n  GPS ( on some devices GPS is blocked, but as it's a non-transmitting device, this doesn't make much sense )\n  Once airplane mode is enabled, certain radios are allowed to be re-enabled (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), however the re-enabling the cellular radio is not possible while airplane mode is active. When airplane mode is disabled, any radios that were disabled when airplane mode was activated, will be re-enabled.\n\nSee the above link for further information.\n", "Q: Kernel Panic - not syncing on Ubuntu 12.04 Yesterday I was updating my ubuntu from 10.04 to 12.04.

I'm newbie on this so I'm affraid to do that without previous info.\nIf someone can give me some clue or know how to fix my computer, it will be great.\nThanks in advance for your advices :) \n\nA: Ok don't panic, good news is you should be able to recover your current install, no need to reinstall from scratch...\nFirst, try to boot in recovery mode:\nFollow the instructions in this post.\nIf you manage to get to the root prompt where you can type commands, things are looking good.

Your 'dropbox start' statement, in fact, started  Dropbox to running in the background!  and the 'done' part of the statement only served to affirm that it is now running.  The earlier part of the statement indicated that yes, dropbox start is a welcome order due to the fact that it is not yet running.  Very simple, also very simple to misunderstand.\n\nA: The above solutions didn't help me. After a time-consuming debugging session I found two ubuntu packages which are important for Dropbox to work:\napt-get install libxslt1.1 libxxf86vm1\n\nAfter installing them, the message when starting was (make sure there is no dropbox process running when starting):\nuser@xubuntu:~$ dropbox start\nStarting Dropbox...Dropbox isn't running!\nDone!\n\n... which means (not obviously): success :-)\nBtw: for thunar-dropbox-plugin (I mean for starting Thunar directly from the tray icon) you need at least the following extra packages:\napt-get install --no-install-recommends thunar-archive-plugin xdg-utils\n\n", "Q: How To Convert a BIN file to ISO on Linux 14.04 Using PowerIso?

I found a command line that uses egrep to find the longest line in a text file, but I don't quite understand all of the syntax nor how it works.\nWith a better grasp on the technique, I may be able to adjust it for other tasks.\nI understand egrep and -n, but I don't follow the use of ^. and the two $ characters.\nCould someone break down the following command?\negrep -n \"^.{$(wc -L < filename)}$\" filename\n\n\nA: Full Command: egrep -n \"^.{$(wc -L < filename)}$\" filename\nBreakdown:\negrep = The egrep program, which searches for lines which match a pattern and prints them.  (similar to grep).  Equivalent to grep -E which interprets the thing in quotes as an extended regular expression pattern.\n-n = egrep argument to state the line number.\n$(wc -L < filename) - wc is a word counter program and prints the number of new lines and stuff in the file.  -L is the wc max line length argument.  < filename is the command to pass the full content of the specified filename file into wc.  $(  ) is a Bashism (something that is related to the bash program and scripting language) and is a way to say \"Process the command in here, then put the output in place of this entire string.  The rest of that command appears to be part of regular expressions, plus the input passed into the string, ultimately with this just being the pattern that egrep matches on.\n\"^.{...}$\" = The \" is just a way to pass that pattern to egrep without characters in it being interpteted as Bash codes.  The rest of this is a regular expression pattern.  Regex is something everyone should know.  I use RegExr to help me learn and understand regex, and to build regex patterns.  To break this down, ^ is an anchor and indicates that it matches the beginning of the string.  . indicates any character except a line break before the next argument.  { and } indicate actual { and } characters in the output, according to RegExr.  The $ at the end is an anchor to indicate the end of the string.\n", "Q: Is the Ubuntu SDK suitable for desktop applications? I'm interested in writing me first application for Ubuntu. I think using the Ubuntu SDK maybe the correct way. However, I'd like to confirm that the assumption to use the Ubuntu SDK is the best technology to use, before I embark on this work. I intend to writing an application intended for a desktop experience.\nMy programming experience to date is largely web technologies. I think to think of myself as a pretty proficient python programmer. Do I need experiences in any other languages before beginning?\n\nA: There is no \"correct\" way to do anything. There's just different ways with advantages and disadvantages. Ubuntu SDK is a good option but there are many others too. Ubuntu SDK is based on the Qt framework which is a popular cross platform GUI framework, but is generally written using C++. \nAnother popular cross platform GUI framework is GTK, which has good bindings in Python using PyGTK.\nOverall this question is going to be very opinionated because like I said, there is no \"right\" way to do it.\n", "Q: How do I import my website? \nHello\n\n\nI have designed a website (link defunct) in the past, and I have used a website hosting service.

I just wanted to eliminate the hosting needs. If it helps, the website files are accessible through an FTP server.\nThanks\n\nA: Just install LAMP in your Ubuntu server and configure it.\nThen just copy your files from the hosting server and place them in your /var/www/html directory. From there just go to http://localhost/ and you will access your site.\n\nA: Yes, you definitely can, but it will depend on a few things, such as whether it uses a database.  If not, it's easier.\nI used to do it a lot, and I would create a virtual site in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf with the same name.  Then I would create an entry in /etc/hosts to redefine that name to localhost.  This part isn't really necessary, but it can be convenient if there are any absolute links.  Then, I'd comment out the entry in the hosts file after uploading.  But you can also create whatever name you want as long as it matches the name in apache's config file.\nIt's been a while since I've done this, but I may have a backup somewhere if you need specifics.  But the basics are to add a VirtualHost entry after the existing one, something like this:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    <Directory  /var/www/html/MYSITE>\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n    </Directory>\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/MYSITE/\n    ServerName WHATEVER_YOU_WANT.X\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 by default serves web pages from /var/www/html/.  You should be able to see \"Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page\" in the index.html that is there once you have installed apache2.\n/etc/apache2/apache2.conf and more specifically /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf define the default DocumentRoot location.\nThe files will need to be readable by the www-data user for Apache to be able to read and serve them.\nAlternatively, just drop your web pages in a directory and point your browser to it such as file:///home/your-user-name/Downloads/. This would only work until it hit an <a href> tag that is not relative.\n", "Q: Why do I have to connect to the internet to install Ubuntu? I have the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Live CD, and I often install it on my friends computers and on my own frequently. So when I want to install it through a CD, I have to connect to the internet first? Wouldn't the operating system already be installed on the CD? I have no problem connecting to the internet. I just want to know why I have to in order to install it. \n\nA: What says you have to connect to the internet?\nIf you mean the installer, that's so that you can have the system attempt to apply updated software automatically after installation of the base software.  It'd then download and install the updates.  If you check the box to update while installing then it forces the internet connection.\nThis does not reign true with the Minimal CD, however, as it does not contain the software for the OS and downloads it from the repositories.\n", "Q: Installing godag on ubuntu On Ubuntu/Linux, I did this:\nhg clone https://godag.googlecode.com/hg/ godag\n\nand after this:\ngo run mk.go install\n\nand it gives me this error:\nup 2 date: utilz/stringbuffer \nup 2 date: utilz/walker \nup 2 date: utilz/stringset \nup 2 date: utilz/global \nup 2 date: utilz/handy\nup 2 date: utilz/say\nup 2 date: utilz/timer\nup 2 date: parse/gopt\nup 2 date: cmplr/dag\nup 2 date: cmplr/gdmake\nup 2 date: cmplr/compiler\nup 2 date: start/main\nlinking  : /usr/lib/go/bin/gd\ncannot create /usr/lib/go/bin/gd: No such file or directory\n2014/10/05 11:05:40 [ERROR] exit status 1\nexit status 1\n\nTried sudo go run mk.go -B=gcc install but I get the same error.

While solving this I was required to update firmware called iwlwifi-7260-7.ucode for the iwlwifi module as described here. But I discovered that there is another newer(?) firmware issued by Intel: iwlwifi-7260-9.ucode so I decided to use it instead of *-7 version, removed the *-7 from /lib/firmware/, downloaded *-9, restarted the iwlwifi and was happily left without networking support. Now I discovered that iwlwifi uses *-7 version only and there is nothing about *-8 and *-9:\nmodinfo iwlwifi\nfilename:       /lib/modules/3.13.0-36-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwlwifi.ko\nlicense:        GPL\nauthor:         Copyright(c) 2003-2013 Intel Corporation <ilw@linux.intel.com>\nversion:        in-tree:\ndescription:    Intel(R) Wireless WiFi driver for Linux\n...\nfirmware:       iwlwifi-7260-7.ucode\n...\n\nSo my question is: am I getting something wrong and *-9 is not an firmware version, or I should search (or recompile) iwlwifi to work with newer modules?\n\nA: Which version of the firmware you're using is actually dependent on the version of the driver in the kernel. So while -9 isn't a firmware version, per se, it does correspond with a driver in a later kernel.

That is not my current kernel not the new kernel but the now useless older kernel. So that I only ever have 2 kernels new and stable.\nCan this be set as a  default in apt?\n\nA: It isn't possible to set APT to do this.\nThis is part design choice, part limitation.\nUbuntu designates each new kernel as a different package name (the package name contains the kernel version) so APT treats them as separate packages.  When they want you to download and install a new package, they create the new kernel package, and then point the generic kernel package (eg linux-kernel-generic) to depend on that new package.  This is what causes the new kernel package to be installed.\nNow, it is (or at least, traditional wisdom says it is) generally a good idea to keep your previous kernel installed when installing a new one, in case there is any incompatibility or bug in the new one.  This allows you to switch kernels from the boot loader.  So Ubuntu do not mark the new kernel packages as \"replacements\" of the old ones, which means APT will simply leave the old ones installed.\nThere is no mechanism in APT or the Ubuntu repositories to specify \"keep the last two kernel packages\".  There could be something like this hacked in, but it may not play very well with all situations, such as when people skip a kernel version.\nNow, while I said this isn't possible to do in APT, there may exist third party software tools that can help you with this, if not on an automatic basis.\nThere is a tool called Ubuntu-tweak which is not available in Ubuntu, but can be installed from a PPA.  This tool has a \"computer janitor\" feature that, among other things, helps you uninstall old kernels.\nOr, you can simply use Synaptic.  Synaptic makes it pretty easy to list installed kernels (search for packages containing linux-image) and from there you can uninstall them easily.\n\nA: This command has been posted in several locations:\napt-get purge $(dpkg --list |egrep 'linux-image-[0-9]' |awk '{print $3,$2}' |sort -nr |tail -n +2 |grep -v $(uname -r) |awk '{ print $2}')\n\nSee http://chr4.org/blog/2013/08/04/apt-get-cleanup-commands/\n", "Q: Applying changes made with xmodmap I'm trying to switch the Ctrl and Command keys using xmodmap, but even though the output of xmodmap -pke shows that the key codes were changed, the keys still perform the original function.\nThis is what I'm doing:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 37 = Super_L\"\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 133 = Control_L\"\nIs there any other step that I should take?

I don't care about compatability or speed; I just want stability, that it is quick to respond, won't wrestle with me when I need to unmount it, etc.\nExt4, btrfs, xfs, or what? \n\nA: When it comes to creating a startup disk from scratch (you want to add all files manually) I'd recommend Ext4, as it basically eliminates all the defrag stuff you need with FAT, it is simple and recognized by most everything UNIX, and has great error recovery support. If you are burning an ISO to create a LiveUSB then it would come with its own (FAT? comment and tell me if I'm wrong on this) format on the disk with an MBR or EFI partition. When it comes to an install disk, it really doesn't matter all that much so long as you don't have it set up to have persistent data across reboots, however if you are installing to the USB Ext4 is what I'd choose, just because in my experiences data integrity is pretty much assured in Ext4 so long as you don't have an unstable medium. in which case it fails completely as it spreads files all over the partition so you can't rely on just partitioning around it and having the free partition space line up with the error.\nWhen it comes to speed and such, I'd refer here as the technology (NAND) is the same for USB drives and SSDs, even if the interface isn't. You may think that the difference in write speed between the two and the bottleneck from USB would limit the stuff here, but what this really measures is how fast a block of system data can be written, regardless of how much writing is actually going on (actually kind of finding how much data has to be put through the port to write a specific amount of data) : http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux_315_hddfs&num=3\nI haven't had a ton of experiences with btrfs, though really Ext4 seems like it would be stable enough to really outperform a lot of other filesystems and seems remarkably capable when compared with all (yes, all) filesystems used natively by windows, like FAT, NTFS, and FAT32.\nIf you are using it for constant writing on a missions critical machine, I would use XFS as Ext4 doesn't do complete metadata/logging of all files and their contents, however for normal use Ext4 is remarkably resilient and doesn't include any unnecessary write requirements for file verification. Once it logs the location of each file and maybe does a hash (on some systems) of a swath of data, it kind of just picks where to write to and does so without going through multiple layers of location verification for each block. \n", "Q: How can I install protobuf in ubuntu 12.04?

So if you need newer features, you'll need to obtain it from the github as described in the other answer.\n\nA: As to me, I install protpbuf 2.6.1 in ubuntu12\n1. download\nhttps://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v2.6.1/protobuf-2.6.1.tar.gz\n2. install\ntar -zxvf protobuf-2.6.1.tar.gz  #unzip\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install build-essential \n\ncd protobuf-2.6.1/ \n\n./configure\n\nmake -j10\n\nmake check -j10 \n\nsudo make install -j10 \n\n3. check install successfully\nprotoc --version  # if echo 'libprotoc 2.6.1' then successfully\n4. If failed\nIf it shows error \"protoc: error while loading shared libraries: libprotoc.so.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\"\nsudo updatedb\nlocate libprotoc.so.9\n/usr/local/lib/libprotoc.so.9\n/usr/local/lib/libprotoc.so.9.0.1\nSo we need add it to LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nvi ~/.bashrc\nthen add \nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib\n\nThen:\nsource ~/.bashrc\nprotoc --version\nyou will get libprotoc 2.6.1\n\nA: Taken from http://www.confusedcoders.com/random/how-to-install-protocol-buffer-2-5-0-on-ubuntu-13-04:\n\nProtocol buffer is a serialization format developed by Google. It is\n  Interface driven and is useful for applications that communicate over\n  the wire. Below are the steps for protocol buffer installation.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Download protocol buffer. Protocol buffer libs can be downloaded here. Download protocol buffer.\n  \n*Check if g++ compiler is installed on box. Protocol buffer needs g++ compiler to be present on your box before it can be built. This is\n  a crisp post on how to install g++ compiler on your box. Install g++\n  compiler.\n  \n*Extract the protocol buffer archive and switch to the extracted directory.\n  \n*Inside the extracted directory hit the below commands to install protocol buffer. These may take a while, kindly be patient.\n./configure\nmake\nmake check\nsudo make install\nprotoc --version\n\n  \n*That's it. Protocol buffer version 2.5.0 is installed on your box.\n  \n*Note: Sometimes the latest version of protocol version does not load up. So we can do it manually by this command\nsudo ldconfig\nprotoc --version\n\n\n\nA: 2019 update\nHere's how I installed protobuf in order to build Eternal Terminal (a pretty amazing terminal emulator that combines autossh with mosh but gives you native scrolling):\nsudo apt install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler\n\n", "Q: HP Pavilion G6 Won't Suspend with Ubuntu 14.04 My HP Pavilion g6-2268ca with Ubuntu 14.04 won't suspend.  when the lid shuts the fan never cuts off.  i've checked my settings under power management and everything looks good.  when I manually click suspend, the screen goes dark for a second and then pops back up.\nOriginally the computer's screen would stay black after the lid was closed, so i followed the directions here:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1978290 to fix that.  but now when i close the lid, fan continues, if the power cord is not installed, the battery will die.  if the cord is installed, the computer will be pretty hot because it isn't suspending.  \nalso after making the changes suggested here:  suspend is not working after updating to Ubuntu 14.04 from 13.10\nI now start the computer and i get the following error: \"could not apply stored configuration for monitors Error on line 1 char 1: Document must begin with an element (e.g. )\"\n\nA: Try updating to an upstream kernel, I'm on 3.15rc2 on trusty and it's working now where it wasn't before.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds\n", "Q: How to connect to my computer from a chromebook via SSH?

How long would it take to go through the setup process?\nThanks\n\nA: You can install the openssh-server with the following command on your desktop\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\nAfter the installation is complete (it just take about a minute), you should be able to SSH to it by:\nssh USERNAME@IP\nUSERNAME is the username on your desktop system, IP is its IP address.\n\nA: It's not too complicated.

I use Google Docs religiously. Thus, I type a lot while in a web browser. You know how when you're looking at a page and there's a text field, you click inside the text field to \"activate\" typing into it. Randomly (sometimes frequently, sometimes rarely) it'll \"deactivate\" typing as if I've clicked somewhere else, so I need to click inside the text field again to \"reactivate\" typing.\nWhat could be causing this? I've tested Ubuntu, Lubuntu and Windows 8.1 and it only happens with Lubuntu.\n\nA: I will bet that you are using a laptop.  I have had the same thing happen to me.

Faster than switching the workspaces. :)\n\nA: Permanently have one or more applications run on specific viewport(s)\nFor the sport of it: to keep one or more applications running on one or more specified viewports, you can use the script below. It runs in the background and works as you describe, but you can add multiple applications to keep running on different viewports.\nAlthough the script looks a bit extensive, most of it only runs one time, to collect data about your viewport(s) span, viewport columns & rows, screen resolution and such. It is not part of the loop.\nIf you close the application window you specified for the viewport, it opens a new window of the application on the targeted viewport.\nHow to use:\nFirst: install wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nThen just copy the script into an empty file, set the application(s) you need to run (in one or more tuples in a list, see example in the head section of the script) and the targeted viewport(s) you need it to run on (and keep available).

I had just solved a strange mouse issue by switching to Proprietary NVIDIA drivers for my video card through the software & updates tool, and rebooted my computer. I fixed the issue but a new one came up for me.\nI have a two-monitor setup, both are 1920x1080 resolution. They both seem to do what they should, but when I attempt to move my mouse to the screen on the right, my left monitor scrolls right along with it. I don't know quite how to describe it but when I move my mouse all the way to the right, I end up having a mirrored display! Then, when I move the mouse back to the left, the left monitor scrolls back until it's back to two separate monitors. \nWhenever I start any program, the window appears in the middle, straddling the two screens. It leads me to believe somehow the left screen's resolution got set too high, but when I look in System Settings under Display, the resolution on both of them is the same, 1920 x 1080. Not really sure why this is. The right screen behaves perfectly as it should.\nUPDATE: After fiddling with xrandr settings, I've determined that I want to have two 1920x1080 screens acting like one 3840x1080 desktop, with no panning on either monitor.

I had to plug both monitors into the same kind of port, on the same graphics card. I had a hard time digging up the cables at home but once I got my hands on a pair of HDMI cables, I was able to set up the monitors correctly without much trouble.\nIt seems obvious now in retrospect but this didn't occur to me, especially since my Windows install on the same machine seemed to handle the original setup (two types of ports, two different devices) well enough. This makes perfect sense though.\n\nA: I met the same bug. Your trick is simply a trigger that makes the bug not to fall in. Since your workaround didn't work for me I digged in a bit and found a nice guy with a solution that might help others here as well.\nThe main problem is that the bug we met here causes the monitor which is scrolling into the other to have a virtual screen with the size of both screens summed. So the solution might seem to disable that extra virtual space on that screen to fit the monitors resolution. This is usually done with the --panning AxB argument - We use it to set the virtual space size.\nThis is how you could do it:\nxrandr \\\n  --output LVDS-1-0 --mode 1920x1080 --panning 1920x1080 --pos 1920x0 \\\n  --output HDMI-0   --mode 1920x1080 --panning 1920x1080 --pos 0x0    --primary\n\n(Slashed \\ added to use newlines in the command.)\nSadly the problem here is that the driver (that is the bug) seems to overwrite the panning we set (or not set). But what it does not is to set another part of the panning: The tracking area! The Tracking area is actually that part of the screen the camera follows the cursor on that monitor.\nSo the idea is to set the panning as the driver but restrict the tracking area instead.\nThis is done with the following command:\nxrandr \\\n  --output LVDS-1-0 --mode 1920x1080 \\\n  --output HDMI-0   --mode 1920x1080 --panning 3840x1080+0+0/1920x1080+1920+0/0/0/0/0    --primary\n\n\"The first four parameters [of the panning argument] specify the total panning area, the next four the pointer tracking area (which defaults to the same area). The last four parameters specify the border and default to 0.\" [man xrandr]\n", "Q: How to stop Chromium from reloading pages (upgrade to 14.04 from 13.10)? Overall chromium under 14.04 functions significantly better than it did under 13.10. However, there's one very big annoyance. I am used to the following scenario:\nLogon to the computer\nStart the browser so that it opens all the tabs.\nPages do not load since internet is not yet connected.\nConnect to the internet and load those tabs that you actually need.\nHowever, chromium under 14.04 insists on reloading the pages as soon as i connect the network. This is very annoying since in means that i have to race the reload process by trying to press Escape on all the loading tabs.\nYesterday evening i had some connectivity issues and that meant that at 3 in the morning i was awoken by a Youtube video that has began playing after my ISP has fixed whatever was happening. This is clearly not what i have intended to happen as the user.\nIs there any way to return back to the previous behaviour and keep chromium from reloading the pages?\n\nA: Yes, there are two flags to fine-tune this behaviour. See also this issue and this blog post.\nIn Chrome/Chromium, enter the following address chrome://flags/#enable-offline-auto-reload (or just chrome://flags and scroll down).  You should see the following two options:\n\nYou can set Enable Offline Auto-Reload Mode to Disabled, which will completely prevent tabs from reloading. I haven't tested Only Auto-Reload Visible Tabs option yet (it's available since Chrome 37), but I guess that tab reloading must be enabled otherwise it will have no effect.\nRestart Chromium for the changes to take effect.\n", "Q: How do I set gvim as default application?

I can't find the executable for `cd` either! I tried which cd and it didn't give a path but instead returned the exit code 1 (checked with echo $?). The coreutil cd itself is working, so the executable should be there, right? I also ran a find for cd, but there was no executable file shown. How is it implemented then?\nUpdate:\nI don't know if I should ask this in another post but since I think it is good here, I'm expanding (?) the post... So the answer was actually quite simple, there's no executable for that — because it's a builtin — But I've found some builtins (bash shell in Fedora) have the executable files! So builtin -> no executable isn't right I suppose? Maybe an answer explaining what builtins actually are (builtin commands?), which actually is the matter here, rather than focusing more on cd... Some good links posted previously indicate that builtins are not programs... so what are they? How do they work? Are they just functions or threads of the shell?\n\nA: from man which:\n\nwhich  returns the pathnames of the files (or links) which would be\n  executed in the current environment, had its arguments been given\n  as commands in a strictly POSIX-conformant shell.  It does this by\n  searching the PATH for  executable files matching the names of the\n  arguments. It does not follow symbolic links.\n\nAs we can see from description of which, it is only checking PATH. So if you implemented some bash function, it will show you nothing. It is better to use type command along with which.\nFor example in Ubuntu ls command aliased to ls --color=auto.\n$ type ls\nls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'\n\n$ which ls\n/bin/ls\n\nAnd if you implement test function hello:\n$ function hello() { for i in {1,2,3}; do echo Hello $i;done }\n$ which hello\n\nwhich shows  nothing. But type:\n$ type hello\nhello is a function\nhello () \n{ \n    for i in {1,2,3};\n    do\n        echo Hello $i;\n    done\n}\n\nIn your case:\n$ type cd\ncd is a shell builtin\n\nThis means that cd is a shell builtin, it is inside bash. All bash builtins described in man bash, in section SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\n       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section\n       as accepting options preceded by - accepts -- to signify the end of the\n       options.   The  :, true, false, and test builtins do not accept options\n       and do not treat -- specially.  The exit, logout, break, continue, let,\n       and  shift builtins accept and process arguments beginning with - with‐\n       out requiring --.  Other builtins that accept  arguments  but  are  not\n       specified  as accepting options interpret arguments beginning with - as\n       invalid options and require -- to prevent this interpretation.\n\n\nA: You cannot find an executable for cd because there is none.\ncd is an internal command of your shell (e.g. bash).\n\nA: Command cd can not be an executable\nIn a shell, cd is used to \"go into another directory\", or more formally, to change the current working directory (CWD). It's impossible to implement that as an external command:\nThe directory belongs to a process\nThe current working directory is the directory that is used to interpret relative paths to obtain a full path that can be used to access files.\nRelative paths are used in many places, and the interpretation in one process should not influence another process.\nFor this reason, every process has its own current working directory.\ncd is about changing the current working directory of the shell process, for example, bash.\nIf it were an external command, an executable in the path, running that executable would create a process with its own working directory, without influencing that of the current shell. Even if the external command would change its directory, that change goes away when the external process exits.\nShell builtin commands\nSo it makes no sense to run an external command for the task of cd. The command cd needs to apply a change to the currently running shell process.\nTo do that, it is a “builtin command” of the shell.\nBuiltin commands are commands that behave similar to external commands, but are implemented in the shell (so cd is not part of the coreutils). This allows the command to change the state of the shell itself, in this case, to call chdir() see (see man 2 chdir);\nAbout which\nNow, the answer to the title question is easy:\nThe executable command which can not tell us that cd is a builtin command because an executable command does not know anything about builtins.\nAlternative type -a\nAs an alternative to which, you can use type -a; It can see executable commands and builtins;  Additionally, it sees aliases and functions - also implemented in the shell:\n$ type -a cd\ncd is a shell builtin\n$ type -a type\ntype is a shell builtin\n$ type -a which\nwhich is /usr/bin/which\nwhich is /bin/which\n\n\nA: cd is a POSIX-mandated shell builtin:\n\nIf a simple command results in a command name and an optional list of arguments, the following actions shall be performed:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If the command name does not contain any slashes, the first successful step in the following sequence shall occur:\n  ...\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If the command name matches the name of a utility listed in the following table, that utility shall be invoked.\n  ...\ncd\n  ...\n  \n*Otherwise, the command shall be searched for using the PATH...\n  \n  \n\nWhile this does not explicitly say it has to be a built-in, the specification goes on to say, in the description of cd:\n\nSince cd affects the current shell execution environment, it is always provided as a shell regular built-in. \n\nFrom the bash manual:\n\nThe following shell builtin commands are inherited from the Bourne Shell. These commands are implemented as specified by the POSIX standard.\n  ...  \ncd\n       cd [-L|[-P [-e]]] [directory]\n\n\n\nI suppose it you could think of an architecture where cd doesn't have to be a builtin. However, you have to see what a built-in implies. If you write special code in the shell to do something for a some command, you're getting close to having a builtin. The more you do, the better it is to simply have a builtin.\nFor example, you could have the shell have IPC to communicate with subprocesses, and there would be a cd program which would check for existence of the directory and whether you have permission to access and it and then communicates with the shell to tell it to change its directory. However, you'll have to then check if the process communicating with you is a child (or make special means of communication with children only, such as a special file descriptor, shared memory, etc.), and if the process is in fact running the trusted cd program or something else. That's a whole can of worms. \nOr you could have a cd program which makes the chdir system call, and the starts a new shell with all the current environment variables applied to the new shell, and then kills its parent shell (somehow) when done.1\nWorse, you could even have a system where a process can alter other processes' environments (I think technically you can do this with debuggers). However such a system would be very, very vulnerable.\nYou'll find yourself adding more and more code to secure such methods, and it's considerably simpler to simply make it a builtin.\n\nThat something is an executable does not prevent it from being a builtin. Case in point:\necho and test\necho and test are POSIX-mandated utilities (/bin/echo and /bin/test). Yet nearly every popular shell has a builtin echo and test. Similarly, kill is also builtin that's available as a program. Others include:\n\n\n*\n\n*sleep (not as common)\n\n*time\n\n*false\n\n*true\n\n*printf\nHowever, there are some cases where a command cannot be anything but a builtin. One of those is cd. Typically, if the full path is not specified, and the command name matches that of a builtin, a function suited to that command is called. Depending on the shell, the behaviour of the builtin and that of the executable may differ (this is particularly a problem for echo, which has wildly differing behaviours. If you want to be certain of the behaviour, it is preferable to call the executable using the full path, and set variables like POSIXLY_CORRECT (even then there's no real guarantee).\nTechnically there's nothing preventing you from providing an OS that is also a shell and has every command as a builtin. Close to this extreme end is the monolithic BusyBox. BusyBox is a single binary, that (depending on the name with which it is called) can behave as any of over 240 programs, including an Almquist Shell (ash). If you unset PATH while running the BusyBox ash, the programs available in BusyBox are still accessible to you without specifying a PATH. They come close to being shell builtins, except that the shell itself is a sort-of builtin to BusyBox.\n\nCase study: The Debian Almquist Shell (dash)\nIf you look at the dash source, the execution thread is something like this (of course, with additional functions involved when pipes and other things are used):\nmain → cmdloop → evaltree → evalcommand\nevalcommand then uses findcommand to determine what the command is. If it is a builtin, then:\n case CMDBUILTIN:\n     if (spclbltin > 0 || argc == 0) {\n         poplocalvars(1);\n         if (execcmd && argc > 1)\n             listsetvar(varlist.list, VEXPORT);\n     }\n     if (evalbltin(cmdentry.u.cmd, argc, argv, flags)) {\n         if (exception == EXERROR && spclbltin <= 0) {\n             FORCEINTON;\n             break;\n\ncmdentry.u.cmd is a struct (struct builtincmd), one of whose members is a function pointer, with a signature typical of main: (int, char **). The evalbltin function calls (depending on whether the builtin is the eval command or not) either evalcmd, or this function pointer. The actual functions are defined in various source files. echo, for example, is:\nint\nechocmd(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n    int nonl;\n\n    nonl = *++argv ? equal(*argv, \"-n\") : 0;\n    argv += nonl;\n\n    do {\n        int c;\n\n        if (likely(*argv))\n            nonl += print_escape_str(\"%s\", NULL, NULL, *argv++);\n        if (nonl > 0)\n            break;\n\n        c = *argv ? ' ' : '\\n';\n        out1c(c);\n    } while (*argv);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAll the links to source code in this section are line number-based, so they may change without notice.\n\n1 POSIX systems do have a cd executable.\n\nSide note:\nThere are a lot of excellent posts on Unix & Linux which deal with shell behaviour. In particular:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is printf better than echo?\n\n*Why not use \"which\"? What to use then?\n\n*Why can't I redirect a path name output from one command to “cd”?\n\n*What is the point of the cd external command?\n\n*Is there a difference between prepending a name-value-pair to a command and using env in bash?\n\n If you haven't noticed a pattern in the questions listed so far, nearly all of them involve Stéphane Chazelas.\n\n", "Q: Whenever I am trying to install skype or google talk Whenever I am trying to install skype or google talk , after downloading from internet when I am trying to open with software centre they says \n,\nI am using ubuntu 12.04, 64 bit\n\nA: I think it's maybe because they don't exist in the Software Centre in the first place.\nBut what you could do is instead install them with the terminal.

The flag -i means install.

On Ubuntu, when I wake up my system after a suspend, I'm taken to the login screen, as I'd expect. However, the system is consistently unresponsive for a period of time ranging roughly between 16 and 24 seconds. During this period, I am unable to move the cursor or to enter anything using the keyboard. After the unresponsive period, I am able to move the cursor and interact with the system using the keyboard normally; also, if I type during the unresponsive period, up to 5 characters will appear in the password field once the system resumes normal function (if I typed x characters during the unresponsive period, then if x<5, x characters will appear.

Shouldn't I also change something in /etc/fstab?\nThanks\n\nA: It would, but you would also need to do some more things.

Any help? I'm going to have to go back to Windows if I can't get this to work :/\n\nA: \n\"This sound device does not have any controls\"\n\nSounds like you face a problem similar to what I had getting the FCA610 to work. The device has probably been detected and brought up by ALSA just fine (you can check this be suspending pulseaudio and use the card with aplay and arecord), but doesn't get picked up by PulseAudio because it cannot find a matching profile for your interface (look at the output of pulseaudio -vvvv to find messages of PulseAudio giving up to configure the device after trying for 5 times).\nI was pointed to a discussion from January 2014 for a workaround on the PulseAudio mailing list and was able to get my device working.\nNote that the topic was about firewire devices. For USB devices you would have to use a matching udev rule with vendor and product id for your device, mine looks like this:\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"1397\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0003\", ENV{PULSE_PROFILE_SET}=\"multichannel.conf\"\n\nyou can find the vendor end product id of USB devices by using lsusb, here is the example for the Behringer FCA610:\nBus 003 Device 051: ID 1397:0003 BEHRINGER International GmbH\n\nTo create and edit files on the commandline you can use nano. Ctrl+o saves changes and Ctrl+x quits.\nThere is also a patch from David Henningson that adds functionality to properly detect such devices, but you would have to compile PulseAudio yourself to test this (which I didn't find enough time for).\n\nA: The Tascam US-122L is only supported via the usb_stream access method which aplay cannot work with.  You need to use the instructions (in another answer) for creating a usb_stream access in your .asoundrc.\nThe only application I know that actually can open devices like that is jackd.  It may have at one time offered -dusb_stream as access method: no idea.  At least some old instructions seem to imply that.  But I only got is working with -dalsa -dusb_stream:1 (use the correct card number).  Once you have jackd running (I use -r96000 -p512 -n2 I think), you can go from there.\nFor Ardour and other jack-centric applications, you are set.\nOn the Ubuntu desktop, the least painful way for most applications will be to go via Pulseaudio.

Per the info here (http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2362-1/) I ran an apt-get dist-upgrade. For reference, i ran apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgrade and then apt-get upgrade to try & make sure I had everything up to the latest versions (I routinely run the apt-get upgrade though).\nAfter successfully doing this, I found that a number of my Perl scripts were no longer functioning.  For reference, I use this server for Nagios to monitor all of my other servers.  The scripts in question that are now failing all connect to a system via https, log into the host and query various bits of information.  \nPrior to the upgrade, I was able to add a line to each of my Perl scripts to make it ignore the SSL:\n$ENV{PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME} = 0 } \n\nHowever, after the upgrade, this seems to have no affect, and the scripts all fail because they can't verify the SSL certs (all self signed).\nHere's some snips of what I'm seeing:\nscript execution:\n    nagios@nagios:/usr/local/nagios/libexec$ ./check_esx.pl -H 192.168.22.18 -u root -p password -l cpu\nCHECK_ESX.PL CRITICAL - Can't connect to 192.168.22.18:443 (certificate verify failed)\n\nLWP::Protocol::https::Socket: SSL connect attempt failed error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed at /usr/share/perl5/LWP/Protocol/http.pm line 41.\n\nThis particular Perl script utilizes the \"VMware Infrastructure (VI) Perl Toolkit\" to function.

Alternatively:\n (B-2) Is there a way to make Ubuntu recognize my windows active directory Cert Authority such that I could issue SSL certs from my CA to the systems in question, and have it recognized by the Perl scripts?\nThanks in advance everyone!\n\nA: \n$ENV{PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME} = 0 \n\nThis was a bug in LWP (CVE-2014-3230) which was fixed in newer versions. PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME is only used to omit verifying the hostname in the certificate, not the certificate chain. But, because you are using a self-signed certificate chain verification will fail.\nThis option was only introduced for the migration from the old Crypt::SSLeay backend to the new IO::Socket::SSL backend. Crypt::SSLeay does not support verification of the hostname (and is thus open for man-in-the-middle attacks), while IO::Socket::SSL does. With LWP version 6 the default backend is IO::Socket::SSL.\nTo completely disable verification of the certificate set SSL_verify_mode => SSL_VERIFY_NONE (you need to use IO::Socket::SSL to have access to the SSL_VERIFY_NONE constant, or just use 0) in the ssl_opts of LWP. There is no environment variable to do this.\nExample:\nuse LWP::UserAgent;\nuse IO::Socket::SSL;\nmy $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(..., ssl_opts => { SSL_verify_mode => SSL_VERIFY_NONE });\n$ua->get(...); # or $ua->post(...) or $ua->request(...)\n\nUnfortunately I cannot see any use of LWP in the script you referenced, so I don't see where to fix it there.\nAs for your options B:\n\n(B) Is there a way to import a self signed SSL cert from another host into Ubuntu so that the Perl script will recognize & trust it?\n  Alternatively: (B-2) Is there a way to make Ubuntu recognize my windows active directory Cert Authority such that I could issue SSL certs from my CA to the systems in question, and have it recognized by the Perl scripts?\n\nYou should be able to use the environment variable PERL_LWP_SSL_CA_FILE to specify a file which CAs or self-signed certificates you accept as trusted.\n\nA: I think it's a perl version issue, check what perl version did you use previously to run that script.\nWhat I'm sure about is that Ubuntu installs the latest stable version of every software. Take for example if you have a python3 script that runs on ubuntu 12.04 it might not work on ubuntu 14.04, and the reason for that is the firs has python 3.2, when the latterhas python 3.4 version.\nI assume the same happen to you perl script, check perl version, and the release note of the new version.\n", "Q: how do I install Aptitude on Ubuntu I was trying to install MemCached using this command: sudo aptitude install memcached, but I got the following error: sudo: aptitude: command not found.\nAfter researching, I found out that Aptitude is an utility program to manipulate files, install out uninstall programs.

At my job we have a data repository running Ubuntu 12.04.03 CLI and as I was checking them this morning when I logged in instead of giving me the normal information it said the information couldn't be displayed because the system load is above 2 and I was wondering what this meant? I had just restarted it because it was unresponive does it have something to do with the process of starting up and getting everything going? \n\nA: Run the top or uptime commands:\n$ uptime\n 19:36:03 up 5 days,  9:12,  8 users,  load average: 0.05, 0.16, 0.21\n$ top -bn1 | head -1\ntop - 19:36:07 up 5 days,  9:13,  8 users,  load average: 0.05, 0.16, 0.21\n\nThe load averages stated here are:\n/proc/loadavg\n          The  first  three  fields  in this file are load average figures\n          giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state R) or  waiting\n          for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.  They\n          are the same as the load average numbers given by uptime(1)  and\n          other  programs. \n\nConsider my load averages: 0.05, 0.16, 0.21\nThat means, over the last minute, on an average, 0.05 processes have been waiting for resources.\nShould you be worried that the load average is 2? In general, if the load average is greater than the number of CPUs available, then some process had to idle around waiting for a CPU slot.\nIf the load average is less than the output of nproc, you don't need to worry.\nAlso see: What does load average mean in unix/linux?\nAs Braiam notes, the processes need not be waiting only for CPU: Understanding load average vs. cpu usage\n\nA: The system load is relevent to the number of the CPU cores, for exampleif you have a Quad Cores CPU (4 Cores) the value 1 means that the system load is on 25%, and 4 means 100%.\n\nA: System Load or System Load Average\nIt is run-queue i.e a queue  of processes waiting for a resource(cpu, i/o etc.) to become available .\nConsider a single-core cpu as a single lane of traffic with bridge and process as cars.\nNow in this situation System load is        \n\n\n*\n\n*0.0 - If there is no traffic on the road.\n\n*1.0 -If the traffic on the road is exactly the capacity of bridge.\n\n*More than 1 - If the traffic on road is higher than the capacity of bridge and cars have to wait to pass trough the bridge.\n\n\nThis number is not normalized according to your cpu.\nIn Multiprocessor system, load 2 mean 100 % utilization of we are using dual-core processor, load 4 means 100% utilization if we are using  quad-core. \nYou can get your system load using \n\n\n*\n\n*uptime  \n\n*cat /proc/loadavg \n\n*top \n$uptime\n22:49:47 up 11:47,  4 users,  load average: 2.20, 1.03, 0.82\nHere the last three number representing the system load average for 1, 5 and 15 minutes respectively.\nThe example above indicates that on average there were 2.20 processes waiting to be scheduled on the run-queue measured over the last minute.\n\nA: If you type in terminal uptime you will see something like : load average and a three columns of digits which are loads from one, five and fifteen minutes. If you have dual core procesor 2 means 100% utilizing, 1 means 50% etc.\n\nA: A system load of 2.0 is not very high. On a multi-core system your CPU may still even be partially idle.\nA load average is a measure of how overloaded a CPU core is in terms of number of processes wanting to use it at once.\nThe following assume a single core (single thread) CPU:\n\n*\n\n*0.0\nThe CPU is not doing anything at all. If a process were to start using the CPU then it would be the only one using it.\n\n\n*1.0\nThe CPU is at maximum usage, but there is zero contention between processes for use of the CPU. That is, only a single process is running so it's able to claim 100% of the CPU time for itself.  Alternatively, multiple processes are running but none are claiming 100% CPU, and their combined CPU usage adds up to 100%. They are all still running as fast as they would run even if they had the CPU entirely to themselves.\n\n\n*Greater than 1.0\nThe CPU is at maximum usage, and there are multiple processes wanting to use it concurrently so they are running more slowly than they would otherwise be able to run if they had exclusive use of the CPU.  For example, a load average of 3.0 indicates processes are running at one third the speed they want to run.  A load average of 50.0 indicates processes are running at 1/50 the speed they want to run, due to all the other processes running.  That is, figures higher than 1.0 indicate that the available CPU is being divided up between more and more active processes.\nHaving a multiple core CPU does not change what the figures mean but changes how they should be interpreted.  For example, if you have a 4 core CPU, then a load of 1.0 is still equivalent to one process using 100% CPU on one core, but there are three other cores.  So on a 4 core CPU, the point of maximum efficiency is 4.0, not 1.0 - and the point at which everything is running at 1/3 efficiency is 12.0, not 3.0.  To add to the complexity, a single process may have more than one thread each claiming CPU of its own.  So a single process can use 100% of all 4 cores if it's multi-threaded.\n", "Q: Unallocated space partition to Ubuntu Partition I have a dual boot machine (Win 7 and Ubuntu 14.04). My situation is this one:\n\nsda1 and sda2 are of Windows \nsda6 is my ubuntu partition. I would like to extend this one. I searched on the internet but all the situations look a bit different from mine and I am not able to figure out how to do it properly.\nThanks a lot,\nFab.\n\nA: You can move and extend system partitions with GParted from a live system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount and swap off all partitions with a key symbol in front of them (if any) through the context menu.\n\n*Grow the extended partition (sda4) to include the unallocated space in front of it.\n\n*Move and resize the logical partitions (sda5 and sda6) to your liking.\n\n*Commit the changes and wait for their completion.\n\n\nWarning: There's a risk that the content of the resized file systems is corrupted in the process. For moving and growing operations it's rather low, but you should back up the important data on those partitions nonetheless. Even if the software and hardware were flawless a sudden power outage or battery failure may interrupt the process and leave the data in an inconsistent state.\n\nA: I don't think you'll be able to 'extend it' due to it's position on the drive, at least in the classical sense. Regardless of your decision after the fact, you will have to format the unallocated space, ideally with ext4 since that is what you used for your Ubuntu install partition. You will then be able to mount the new space. If your Ubuntu install was implemented with LVM, you can then go in and add your newly formatted space to the logical volume group. If you didn't set up LVM when you installed your Ubuntu OS, you may still be able to do so (it's been a while since I've had to go through this process). Again, you don't necessarily have to add it to the volume group if you just want to use it for storage or some similar purpose.

After a bunch of problems with my mouse and keyboard not working at the login screen with kernel version 3.15, I went to grub and switched to a lower kernel version (3.5...), and everything was working fine. However, I tried to update to the latest kernel version, which is 3.17, and realized that I can log in, but after that I get a notice that says that there is a problem with my system. If I click report, nothing happens. If I click on cancel (multiple times), it closes the warning panel, and the 14.04 background is visible, but nothing loads; no sidebar, no applications are able to load, and the keyboard shortcuts for the terminal do not work. So, I am left looking at the background. \nDoes anyone know what is happening or have any experience with this issue?\nThanks, \nChmod\n\nA: First you should try to obtain the latest drivers for your video card if you are using proprietary drivers. The best way is a manual installation using the installer from the manufacturer's website.\nFor open source drivers, the PPA below provides near bleeding edge builds which are compatible with the latest mainline kernel usually. It will also have repackaged proprietary installers.\nI had a similar issue that was solved by updating mesa and several other libraries through the Xorg-Edgers PPA. This is usually the case in my experience for updating kernels, they need an updated x server and 3d libraries to work with it.\nFirst install ppa-purge\n    sudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nThen add the ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers\n\nThis will add the repository to your sources.\nsudo apt-get update\n\nReload the packagelist and finally upgrade\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nSome packages may be held back, if some are use this\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf you have any issues use\nsudo ppa-purge -p xorg-edgers\n\nThis will completely remove the repository and re download missing packages.\n\nA: FIX: I switched to X, by using Ctrl+Alt+F7. Then, I uninstalled xorg and reinstalled it.\n", "Q: How to install programs? Keep getting archive manger error When trying to download and install programs keep getting archive manger error.

Why? As per the graylog2 docs, I need to add this line to my rsyslog.conf:\n$template GRAYLOGRFC5424,\"<%pri%>%protocol-version% %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %HOSTNAME% %app-name% %procid% %msg% \\n\"\n\nI'm doing it programmatically when I spin up a server, so the command I've got going currently is:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"\\$template GRAYLOGRFC5424,\\\"<%pri%>%protocol-version% %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %HOSTNAME% %app-name% %procid% %msg% \\\\\\n\\\"\" >> rsyslog.conf'\n\nI'm escaping the dollar sign, both double quotes, and the backslash before the n. However, \\n and \\\\n both write an actual newline to the file, but \\\\\\n writes \\n correctly. Why doesn't \\\\n work?\n\nA: The problem seems to come from the builtin echo in dash (which is sh in Ubuntu by default), which seems to process its \\ arguments differently from other implementations (/bin/echo and the builtin echo in Bash):\n$ sh -c \"echo '\\\\n'\" \n\n\n$ sh -c \"/bin/echo '\\\\n'\"\n\\n\n$ bash -c \"echo '\\\\n'\"\n\\n\n\nThis is not surprising, as using \\ arguments in echo is non-standard:\nhttp://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/echo.html\n\nIf the first operand is -n, or if any of the operands contain a backslash ( '\\' ) character, the results are implementation-defined. \n\nYou should use printf instead of echo, like this:\nprintf '$template GRAYLOGRFC5424,\"<%%pri%%>%%protocol-version%% %%timestamp:::date-rfc3339%% %%HOSTNAME%% %%app-name%% %%procid%% %%msg%% \\\\n\"\\n' | sudo tee -a rsyslog.conf\n\nAs a added bonus, using sudo tee to write to files as root instead of sudo sh -c + shell redirections makes the command cleaner, since the string is parsed only once (as an argument to printf) instead of twice (first as an argument to sh -c and then as an argument to echo).\n", "Q: Permision denied while deleting teamspeak 3 folder I have downloaded teamspeak script (.run), I run it via terminal and after that it created me a locked folder on desktop which I could not modify in any way.\n\n(source: angrrylab.net) \n\nA: In a terminal, you can use ls -l to determine if the files belong to your user, if not then that is the reason you can not delete them.

C, C++ and Fortran can all be compiled on Linux. You can't run your binaries (*.exe) on Ubuntu natively, but if you have the source code, you can still compile them.\nIf you used an IDE, which is available for both Windows and Linux (like Eclipse), you most likely just can import a project into the same IDE on Linux. However, if you used an IDE, which is only available for Windows, you won't be able to take your project setup to Ubuntu.\n\nA: You'd have to be more specific about which programs you were using. The files themselves are normally text, and can transfer over.  Project files are normally not text, and are sometimes compiler/linker specific. If you were already using a cross-platform IDE such as Eclipse, you might be well ahead of the game.  If you were using Microsoft Visual Studio, you'll probably have to recreate the projects.\nCross platform is something that is usually planned ahead of time.  It can be done, but often not until you have used both platforms first.  It's not easy, but there are always things you can do to make it easier, such as conditional statements that used predefined constants to know what to do.\n", "Q: What does \\( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \\)? I wonder what \\( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \\) does. I think it is permission levels but i have trouble finding the -perm command in any documentations.\nIn full context it used in sudo find / -type f \\( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \\) -print\n\nA: man find is pretty clear about it:\n   -perm mode\n\n       File's permission bits are exactly  mode  (octal  or  symbolic).\n          Since  an  exact match is required, if you want to use this form\n          for symbolic modes, you may have to  specify  a  rather  complex\n          mode  string.  For example -perm g=w will only match files which\n          have mode 0020 (that is, ones for which group  write  permission\n          is  the  only  permission set).  It is more likely that you will\n          want to use the `/' or `-' forms, for example -perm -g=w,  which\n          matches  any file with group write permission.  See the EXAMPLES\n          section for some illustrative examples.\n\n   -perm -mode\n\n          All of the permission bits mode are set for the file.   Symbolic\n          modes  are accepted in this form, and this is usually the way in\n          which would want to use them.  You must specify `u', `g' or  `o'\n          if  you use a symbolic mode.   See the EXAMPLES section for some\n          illustrative examples.\n\n   -perm /mode\n\n          Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file.   Symbolic\n          modes  are  accepted in this form.  You must specify `u', `g' or\n          `o' if you use a symbolic mode.  See the  EXAMPLES  section  for\n          some  illustrative  examples.  If no permission bits in mode are\n          set, this test matches any file (the idea here is to be  consis‐\n          tent with the behaviour of -perm -000).\n\n   -perm +mode\n\n          Deprecated,  old way of searching for files with any of the per‐\n          mission bits in mode set.  You should use -perm  /mode  instead.\n          Trying to use the `+' syntax with symbolic modes will yield sur‐\n          prising results.  For example, `+u+x' is a valid  symbolic  mode\n          (equivalent to +u,+x, i.e. 0111) and will therefore not be eval‐\n          uated as -perm +mode but instead as  the  exact  mode  specifier\n          -perm  mode  and so it matches files with exact permissions 0111\n          instead of files with any execute bit set.  If  you  found  this\n          paragraph  confusing,  you're  not alone - just use -perm /mode.\n          This form of the -perm test  is  deprecated  because  the  POSIX\n          specification  requires  the  interpretation of a leading `+' as\n          being part of a symbolic mode, and so we switched to  using  `/'\n          instead.\n\n\nA: This looks like trying to find suid (4000:set userid) sgid (2000:set groupid) file.\nthat is binary that, when run get a new userid, or a new groupid. those are use mostly for\n\n\n*\n\n*system related task\n\n*database (e.g. file belong to oracle or mysql)\n\n*hacking system ...\n\n\nA: This command lists files which have the SETUID or SETGID bits set:\n# find / -type f \\( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \\) -print\n/sbin/unix_chkpwd\n/bin/su\n...\n# stat /bin/su\nAccess: (4755/-rwsr-xr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\n...\n# stat /sbin/pam_extrausers_chkpwd\nAccess: (2755/-rwxr-sr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (   42/  shadow)\n...\n\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*setuid and setgid confusion\n\n*What is the first chmod octal digit in a four-digit value for?\n", "Q: Hiding \"*_files\" When I download web pages complete, I get the html file plus a folder with an _files name.  \nSo every time I ls I get a list of all those files.  \nRenaming is a drag.  \nHow can I get those out of my sight so I can see the real sub directories in my ls?\n\nA: You could define alias in your .bashrc like this:\n alias ls=\"ls --hide='*_files'\"\n\nsave your change and run:\n source .bashrc\n\nAfter this command, if you want to view full content of folder you can use:\n ls -a\n\n\nA: cd _files && ls\nor\nfind . -type f\nThe _files directory is a real sub-directory.

With this I assume you had to setup 'biosgrub' partitions and you have to manually boot into the Ubuntu biosgrub partition or the Windows Boot Manager. I would check your PC maker and see if they have an update to your BIOS, this might allow you to install both under EFI and use GPT instead so you don't have to have all these boot managers and biosgrub partitions.

I have a UEFI-supported board and I'm going to use the GPT partition type. I'd like to check to see if I'm on the right track or not.\nMy basic idea is: (updated to show Windows-required MSR partition)\nsda1- EFI/ESP    FAT32    0.25gb\nsda2- / (root)   EXT4     20gb\nsda3- (MSR)      ----     0.13gb\nsda4- win C:     NTFS     30gb\nsda5- win D:     NTFS     500gb\nsda6- /home      EXT4     300gb\nsda7- (swap)     ???      16gb\n\nNow on my single physical 1TB hard drive this leaves about 100gb and change unallocated for any future OS experiments or to make a shared drive between Windows and Ubuntu using some other file system if I run into problems.\nFor my allocated space NTFS is of course a natively supported Windows file system and seems to be fairly stable on Ubuntu so it sounds like the best choice for my Win partitions. I briefly looked at ExFAT but it sounds like it doesn't have as good of support on either Ubuntu or Windows so NTFS wins out.\nThe Ubuntu situation is less clear. I'm probably not going to be doing a lot of access of Ubuntu files from the Windows side and since it seems that there is a significant performance difference between EXT3 and EXT4, I decided to go with 4. EXT3 has more support but it doesn't look like it's necessarily better support (i.e. you have to open up a separate program to access EXT3 files). There is at least decent EXT4 file support in the form of ExtFS for Windows which works with the standard file management tools, and if that doesn't work then I probably can save my files directly to the NTFS D: drive from Ubuntu. The Swap partition from what I understand is a special \"swap\" file system, but I really had trouble finding any info on it.\nFrom what I understand, the order of the two larger drives (Win D: and Ubuntu /home) doesn't matter so much but I should keep the two system drives (Win C: and Ubuntu root) close to the UEFI/ESP partition. Nothing I read talked about the order of the Swap partition at all and I saw partition schemes with it towards the beginning or at the end, so I'm guessing its order doesn't matter either.\nIs this a reasonable setup or is there anything I'm getting wrong (size/system)? Does it make sense to have a separate Ubuntu Home and Windows Programs/Media partition, or would it make more sense to combine them as a big happy NTFS family? I'll probably be installing different versions of the same program on the Windows and Ubuntu side (like Steam and Eclipse IDE for example), so my instinct is to keep them separate and avoid confusion. If I do choose to add in a separate partition that is primarily for cross-platform work, what would be the best file system - NTFS? Something else? Is there anything else I should be aware of compatibility-wise by using EXT4 instead of the older EXT3?\nI'm going to be switching over to mostly using Ubuntu but keeping Windows for gaming. As a long-time Windows user I have approximately a billion questions about Ubuntu but I'm going to start with just the partition and file format scheme for now.\n\nA: I will try to answer as many of your questions as I can:\nIs this a reasonable setup or is there anything I'm getting wrong (size/system)? \nWhat is reasonable for one user may not be for another. This is because we all use our computers for different purposes, and in different ways. As others have pointed out:\n\n\n*\n\n*You probably wont need 16GB Swap. 2GB should be enough.\n\n*30GB C: for Windows system partition may be too small.\n\n\nHowever, these are your choices. The rest seems OK to me. \nDoes it make sense to have a separate Ubuntu Home and Windows Programs/Media \npartition, or would it make more sense to combine them as a big happy NTFS family?\nYou can't put the Ubuntu /home partition in the NTFS format. Ubuntu keeps its user configurations in the /home for each user. Each user has her ownership and read/write permissions. Ubuntu cannot use NTFS for storing ownership and permissions. It needs to be one of the Linux compatible partition formats, such as ext2, ext3, ext4, zfs, btfs, etc. As you know Windows on its own does not understand any of these partition formats. So it is best to keep them separate and use their respective native formats, NTFS for Windows, and ext4 for Ubuntu.\nSee I want to reformat my home partition from ext3 to ntfs for more on this.\nIf I do choose to add in a separate partition that is primarily for cross-platform work, what would be the best file system - NTFS? Something else?\nI don't think you need a separate partition for cross-platform work, but if you do, it should be NTFS. You can share sda5 or D: in NTFS  with Ubuntu. I recommend you create soft links of specific folders from sda5 (D:) to sda6 (/home). For example:\nD:\\user\\[yourID_in_windows]\\Java_Workspace can be soft-linked to /home/[yourID_in_Ubuntu]/Java_Workspace\nSee Do I need Intel Smart Response when installing Ubuntu? for an example of how to create soft-links of specific folders between two drives. The same commands can be used for creating soft links between NTFS and ext4 partitions. If you want you can keep all your music, video, etc. in D: and have links in your /home partition.\nIs there anything else I should be aware of compatibility-wise by using ext4 instead of the older ext3?\next4 is a mature partition format used by default in Ubuntu. You have nothing to worry about if you stick to ext4.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Having trouble running more than one vmware VM simultaneously on Ubuntu I have a i7 machine with 8GB RAM and two external harddisks, both contains a NTFS partition, today I noticed some gaps while booting a second vm under Ubuntu, which took more than 5 minutes to boot up, I usually do the same under Windows and both vms boots up reasonabily well.\nWhat's the best filesystem to format my HDD in order to get the best virtualization experience under Ubuntu?

Granted, I know the updated look and feel of the OS itself will be mildly different, but as far as performance/compatibility/security/driver updates/etc. will there be a big, if any, difference?\nThank you.\n\nA: It depends on the software you use. In general, packages in a given Ubuntu release only get updates to fix severe bugs, which severely impact the functionality of a program  or render it insecure. However, new features are typically not included as updates. Hence, if a program you use had a new version which introduced many new features, including performance or compatibility improvements, you will not get them (at least not as part of the normal package upgrade process).\nSo my advice if you think 14.04 is really too much of a problem, is to try 12.04 and see if it works for you. If it does, great. If some programs are too old and lack features you need, however, you might have to decide between upgrading those programs yourself (from source or from a PPA, for example), or reverting to 14.04 and deal with the problems you have with it.\n", "Q: Is SOCKS4/5 supported by apt? The manpage for apt.conf doesn't mention SOCKS at all. Yet there are a few questions about SOCKS and apt here, and every now and then I see an answer which has something like:\nAcquire::http::proxy ..\nAcquire::https::proxy ..\nAcquire::ftp::proxy ..\nAcquire::socks::proxy ..\n\n(all four) in them. Acquire::socks doesn't raise an error, but doesn't seem to have an effect either.\nWhat exactly is the state of support for SOCKS proxies in apt?\n\nA: The apt source code has no mention of SOCKS whatsoever:\n/tmp/apt-1.0.9.1ubuntu1$ grep -ir socks .\n/tmp/apt-1.0.9.1ubuntu1$\n\nIt's also possible to have extension plugins for apt, such as apt-transport-https. These add files to /usr/lib/apt/methods/. So I used apt-file find to look for any other packages that provide files into this directory. This also did not reveal anything SOCKS related.\nIt's impossible to prove a negative, but I'd say that it's safe to say that apt itself has no SOCKS support right now. It looks like tsocks is the only real way forward.\nI'm confused as to how others have concluded that Acquire::socks exists, but I can find no evidence of it. If I've missed something then I guess this answer is completely wrong (and I'll delete it).\n\nA: I've just tested Acquire::http::proxy which works fine (or not if the proxy is down), but :socks: just goes directly to the net, skipping any (absent or not) proxy.\nSo it would seem it's impossible to use apt over socks, at least on Ubuntu 16.04.2.\n", "Q: \"chmod: cannot operate on dangling symlink '/etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json\" I am trying to install transmission on my Ubuntu 14.04 server and I am unsure whether to skip this part or not.

Basically, it seems that anytime I perform any add, modify, move, copy, or delete a file on my file system and when opening images in the default image viewer, after a few moments of completing the task, the entire UI freezes except for the mouse cursor, which is restricted to staying on the single screen that it was on when the UI froze (I.E. I can't move the mouse to the other of my dual monitors). The freeze lasts for a short while...maybe 30 seconds to a minute (I'm not quite sure exactly how long it is though), after which the UI continues to function and anything that tried to do with the mouse (other than move it to the second monitor) while the UI was frozen executes as it should in the correct order as well. I've also noticed that my load average is hardly a 2 when the freeze begins, but is around 18 or so after the freeze ends (I have an i7 with 4 hyperthreaded cores). I assume that the load average of 18 is probably because it has tons of queued processes ready to execute that were put off during the freeze. However, when I edit/move/copy/create/delete files in an editor like Sublime Text or Android Studio no freeze occurs whatsoever. The freeze occurs regardless of whether or not I perform the action(s) in the terminal or in nautilus. I've searched and searched and I can't find an answer to why this is happening. Perhaps I don't know the right thing to search for, but I hope that someone here can help.\n\nMy setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Version: 14.04 LTS (latest updates installed)\n\n*Partition Containing OS:  sda5 (Format: ext4)\n\n*RAM: 12 GB DDR3 (3-Channel)\n\n*I've verified that swap is indeed working.

Normally, you would mount the home directory, not link to it.  It would certainly be easier to just mount ~/home to /mnt/home or /mnt/Data/home, wouldn't it?  I'm not sure, but there may be some overhead to following the symbolic link every time it needs to access your home directory.  You could easily find out by temporarily mounting it and removing the link as a first step in troubleshooting.\nAdded Info:\nNormally, you would mount /home/uname directly, so other users can mount their own home directory elsewhere, if desired.  You can mount any directory any place you want, actually, although there are conventions.\nHowever, it sounds like you want to configure your system the same way I always have, which I think is actually superior...\nI create the equivalent of your /mnt/data for all my personal data, with directories such as /mnt/data/Documents, /mnt/data/Music, Downloads, Videos, etc.  I keep my home directory just like it installs (or reinstalls).\nThen I create symbolic links inside my home directory to these subdirectories, but leave all the configuration files, directories, etc as is.\nThere's an easy way to do this using Nautilus that maintains the special icons for the special directories, although it can be edited.  I can give you more details after we (or someone) figures out your main problem, in case it has nothing to do with links.  Doing this, I cannot really tell the difference between a normal setup and the links, until I need to reinstall, then I repeat; it doesn't take long.\nI don't really think having the symbolic link make a difference for your problem, but my suggestion was to test it just to see.

How can I get the right one for me?\nThe trick is to investigate the .inf file that instructs windows what to install.\nSearching for 21D7 (note the capital D instead of 'd') I get this:\n%Dell1704.DeviceDesc%=RAMUSB21D7,           USB\\VID_0A5C&PID_21D7       ; BRCM Generic 43142A0 RAMUSB\nThe USB/VID&PID is what I get on lsusb: capital(0a5c:21d7).\nThe RAMUSB21D7 is what I need to search next in the inf file (it is the device's description).\nAnd this is my result:\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;RAMUSB21D7;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n\n[RAMUSB21D7.CopyList]\nbcbtums.sys\nbtwampfl.sys\nBCM43142A0_001.001.011.0122.0126.hex\n\nAnd the hex file I shall use is BCM43142A0_001.001.011.0122.0126.hex\nThe rest is the same as above. Get the tool trough git, build it, convert the hex file to hcd, discard/reload the btusb.\nNote: Be aware the hcd file should start with fw-...... and not fw_......

Let me tell the complete story. I have a normal PC with monitor, CPU, UPS, mouse and a keyboard. I use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. For the last 15 days my computer is shutting down unexpectedly. Here in my case I can not say that it is exactly shutting down.\nWhen I switch on only my monitor then it shows that 'there is no signal'\nthis is because I have not turned on my CPU. And so I turned on my CPU. Then my PC started working. \nFew days before when I was working on my PC and it was working normally.\nThen suddenly my monitor turned off and on its screen there was a message that 'there is no signal' but at that time my CPU was on.\nAfter that when I tuned off my CPU manually then I again tried to start me PC but I failed. After a day when I started it then it worked normally.\nInitially I thought that:\n1) there may be a problem in my cable wire which connect the monitor and the CPU. But this is not the problem since I have used another cable wire.\n2) there may be a problem in my PC. But this is not the problem since I connected my CPU with another monitor, second reason is that if my monitor is having problem then it should not work afterwards but in my case it is working after wards.\n3) there may be a problem of overheating but this is also not possible since once it turned of within 5 minutes. And maximum I work on my PC is for 2 hrs.\nI have even updated my PC using update manager put then too it is not working well.\nI have not taken any help from any technical engineer because:\n1) Once when I asked them about Ubuntu then they said that they don't know about Ubuntu and the problem is internal and you must try window.\n2) I don't know anybody who know Ubuntu well.\nI am posting this question from my PC but I don't know till when it will work well!\nKindly help me to find the problem in my PC.\n\nA: It is possible that the machine is overheating and the CPU was turned off when it hit a thermal trip threshold.  If it is overheating, you could try using thermald which will try and prevent thermal overrun by using various passive cooling mechanisms.

I tried re installing guest additions but it doesn't seem to work. I've checked that \"Bidirectional clipboard\" was enabled.\n\nA: Started working after running: sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms and enabling bidirectional shared clipboard.\n\nA: Background:\nI run Windows 7 64 bit, Linux inside Virtual Box v4.3.16 r95972.  After building a new \n3.17 kernel on one of my VM's the guest additions in general stopped working (this \nincluded both Cut&Paste and the window resizing).  \nSummary:\nI found I needed the later version of virtual box guest additions from Oracle, loaded \nas an .iso file, and another utility called parcellite.  My cut and paste is a two step\noperation.\nAttempted fixes:\nI tried removing and reinstalling various guest additions (iso, dkms, x11) using the \napt-get remove and apt-get install all to no avail.  Then I noticed that I had \nproblems reading the virtual CD (VERR_PDM_MEDIA_LOCKED) where I had originally loaded \nanother version of the guest additions from Oracle.  \nIt turned out that the guest additions from Oracle were 4.3.16 (see this via modinfo \nvboxguest) and the versions from apt-get were 4.3.10.  However in order to re-install \nthe later version from the .iso file I had to find a way around the CD mount problem.  \nWhat finally worked for me was to make sure that all CD's were unmounted from all of my \nVM's using the 'Devices -> CD/DVD Devices -> remove disk' selection and then to mount \nthe .iso file via the VirtualBox Manager via the Settings -> Storage -> IDE Controller \n\"CD icon\".  When I selected the .iso file from the VirtualBox Manger its installation \nwindow popped up in my VM, but trying to access this file from the VM always failed.  \nOnce this installation finished I power cycled the VM and the guest additions worked \nagain.\nCut and Paste still seems to have an issue that I had worked around before.  The work\naround is to install parcellite (Ubuntu software center or apt-get).  This is a \nclipboard manager that creates an icon in the top right where you can access the \nclipboard for cut and paste.  Using the left and right mouse buttons to select text in \nan xterm window cuts to a different buffer than the clipboard (I read online) which is \nwhy it does not seem to work between machines.  \nSo to cut and paste to Windows from a Linux xterm I do a multi step process: \n- first select the text using left and right mouse clicks, \n- then open parcellite and select History, which opens an Editing Clipboard window.\n- Use the mouse middle mouse button to paste into this clipboard.\n- Then select the text (again!) using the mouse, after doing the right click here you get a pop-up selection where you select 'Copy'.\n- Now when you paste into a Windows area the text you 'Copy' selected appears.  \nHope this helps!\n- Jon Shapiro\n\nA: Mine wasn't working too, Windows 7 64bit running Ubuntu 10.04.

I found https://launchpad.net/ there's loads of applications to choose from there it seems like all of them. You've got to add the ppa, update then install the applications. This can be pretty cumbersome if you plan on installing a few with the terminal.\nIs there a launchpad application that replaces the ubuntu software centre?

It's a developer platform around software for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions. As such it includes many software repositories, that are searchable with software center once they're configured locally.\nThere's a good reason to not include repositories where anybody can publish software to by default, because then anybody could trick people into installing their unsafe or malicious software packages instead of the official ones (see also “Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some “red flags” to watch out for?”). Canonical decides for themselves which packages go into their “official” repositories to mitigate the risk of harmful or malicious code.

You do need a copy of Windows (XP in my case), or something like TinyXP  (since it's just a step in the process I'll leave the ethical concerns to the user). I'll outline the process just to point anyone interested in the right direction.\n-Install VirtualBox, as well as VirtualBox Guest Additions (needed for USB support), and add your user name to the vboxusers group.\n-Download the latest Timex Device Agent from Timex and [STM32 Virtual Com Port Driver] from http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257938\n-Create a Windows machine with a Shared Folder access to where you downloaded the Timex and STM software. \n-Under the Windows machine install the Timex and STM driver (choose 32 bit or 64 bit based on your copy of Windows). Close the Windows machine down.\n-Plug in your Timex to a USB port. Under VirtualBox Manager ->Settings -> USB enable both check boxes for the USB controller. Press the second button on the right (plus sign icon). One of the choices should be \"STMElectronics STM32 Virtual COM Port\". Select this one. You are adding a USB filter to allow the watch to tunnel to the virtual copy of Windows.\n-Start the Windows machine, then put the watch into PC Sync (pressing the Mode button on the watch). If you start the Device Agent in Windows (skip the Training Peaks login/account creation unless it applies to you) you should be able to download workouts, configure the watch, and update the firmware as usual. You can save the downloaded files into a Shared Folder to work with them under Ubuntu or upload them to Training Peaks. \nGood Luck\n", "Q: manage /opt folder permissions I'm asking how to manage the permissions of /opt folder and files/folders under it.

However, I don't know if this is the right thing to do.\nFor example, to correctly run Google Chrome, I have to switch back chrome-sandbox to root:root; also, if I try to run the Android SDK Manager via /opt/android-sdk-linux/tools/android it fails to fetch some links and I have to run the previous command as superuser.\nSo, do I have to switch all the things back to prevent other issues?\n\nA: There is a basic confusion here: the fact that an application is owned by root does not mean that is run as root at all.\nWhen you run cat: \nls -l /bin/cat\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 47904 mar 24  2014 /bin/cat\n\nyou run it as your user, because your user (and all other users) can read and execute it. This is the reason why \ncat /etc/passwd-\n\ngives \ncat: /etc/passwd-: Permission denied\n\n(because only root can read that file). \nThe exception are \"set-uid\" executables; but if an executable is \"set-uid\" is because normally it needs it, like the sandbox you mention. If you do not trust a set-uid executable, the only option is not running it. \nSo changing the ownership of the files under /opt will not enhance the security, and can breaks all kind of things.(1)(2)\nSee also: How can you know if executing a program requires root? \n\n(1) Well, you can do that in \"controlled\" way and it can be useful. If /opt is owned by you you can for example run the installer of Calibre as your user and not as root; mind you, the installer, because the program will run as you anyway. \n(2) You can find all the set-uid (and set-gid) files under /opt with \nfind /opt -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 -print \n\nin case you need to set them back to their original user (that normally is root, but not always; unfortunately there is no way to know which was before your chown -R short of looking at a backup). \n", "Q: Will “guided with encrypted LVM” enable TRIM on a SSD? I currently have a little SSD (32 GB) for / and another HDD (250 GB) for /home where I use eCryptfs to encrypt my personal files. I consider buying a big SSD (500 GB) to have all the data on a SSD as well. With the Kubuntu installer, I found the “guided with encrypted LVM” pretty satisfying, I am just not sure whether this would enable TRIM on the SSD.\nThis seems to pose a bit of a risk, but I assume that the performance will turn bad pretty quickly if I do not use TRIM.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the installer automatically enable TRIM?\n\n*If not, how could I enable it after the installation?\n\n\nA: \nWill “guided with encrypted LVM” enable TRIM on a SSD?\n\nNo. Trim is installed by the installer though but the 2 have no correlation. Trim is enabled based on the brand of your SSD. If the SSD is supported and tested prior and deemded working perfectly trim will be enabled. Otherwise it will be installed and disabled and you need to enable it manually.

How does one write an Upstart task that is guaranteed to run only once after each startup but is also guaranteed to run to completion before either one of at least two other jobs start running. I do not want to alter the Upstart init files for those two other jobs as they do not belong to me. Restarting either of those two other jobs should not cause the desired task to run again.\nThe situation is that the desired task must make some modifications to some files in the local filesystem that both of the other jobs will be needing.\nI'm completely new to Upstart and finding it a steeper learning curve than I'd expected, so an education on why the solution works will be as valuable as the solution itself.\n\nA: I believe I have an answer to my own question that leverages CameronNemo's partial solution and Mark Russell's answer to a related but somewhat different question.\nTwo Upstart configuration files are required. The first is a job that starts as soon as the local filesystem is available, performs the desired file modifications as a pre-start script, and then sits idle in the running state forever:\n# modify-files - Single-execution file modification job\n\nstart on local-filesystems\n\nconsole log\n\npre-start script\n  echo \"$(date --rfc-3339=ns) $(hostname) $UPSTART_JOB\"\n  exec /path/to/your/script\nend script\n\nThe second configuration file is an Upstart task that delays the start of all other jobs that might depend on the files we're trying to modify. It produces one instance of itself per dependent job:\n# modify-files-wait - Helper task for modify-files\n\nstart on (starting jobA or jobB)\nstop on (started modify-files or stopped modify-files)\n\ninstance $JOB\n\nconsole log\nnormal exit 0 2\ntask\n\nscript\n  echo \"$(date --rfc-3339=ns) $(hostname) $UPSTART_JOB ($UPSTART_INSTANCE)\"\n  status modify-files | grep -q \"start/running\" && exit 0\n  start modify-files || true\n  sleep infinity\nend script\n\nUpstart will kill all instances of modify-files-wait once modify-files is idling in its running state. That normal exit line accounts for the possibility of being killed during its infinite sleep. We need the task line to block jobA and joB until the stopped state is reached. Whichever instance runs first will start modify-files, if it hasn't already been started.\nSince modify-files never reaches its stopped state, it will never be run anew, regardless of jobA or jobB being restarted.\nThis solution seems to be working, but I welcome any criticisms or improvements.\n\nA: You can define a simple task job that start on event of your choice, run your script and at the end emit event to start the other two job.\nFor example:\n# mainJob - \n#\n# This service emit myEvent to run firstJob \ndescription \"emit myEvent to run firstJob\"\nstart on runlevel [2345]\ntask\nconsole log\nscript\n     echo \"(startTask) $UPSTART_JOB -- $UPSTART_EVENTS\" \n     exec /path/to/your/script\n     initctl emit -n myEvent\nend script\n\nIn order to do not modify upstart script of the other two jobs, you should override files that allow you to modify the way in which a job starts and stop by modifying the start on and stop on conditions.\nFollowing my examples I created a simple firstJob.conf like this:\n# firstJob - \n#\n# This service print environment variable \ndescription \"print environment variable\"\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\ntask\nconsole log\nscript\nif [ \"$RUNLEVEL\" = \"0\" -o \"$RUNLEVEL\" = \"1\" -o \"$RUNLEVEL\" = \"6\" ]; then\n     exec  echo \"(stopTask) $UPSTART_JOB -- $UPSTART_EVENTS\"  \nelse\n     exec  echo \"(startTask) $UPSTART_JOB -- $UPSTART_EVENTS\" \nfi\nend script\n\nAnd then I override start on condition creating override file:\necho \"start on myEvent\" > /etc/init/firstJob.override\n\nSo firstJob will start on myEvent generated by mainJob and stop on runlevel [016]\nI tested these jobs on lubuntu 12.04 and after reboot I found in /var/log/upstart/firstJob.log:\n  (startTask) firstJob -- myEvent\n\nYou should check if \"the other two jobs\" need particular event condition to start and be sure that mainJob start on these events.\n\nA: start on starting jobA or starting jobB\n\ninstance $JOB\n\npre-start exec /path/to/script\n\nThe starting bit prevents the jobs from moving on in their life cycle until this job completes.\nThe instance bit is so that both starting events (for jobA and jobB) are inhibited, not just one, as would be the case if you did not have an instance stanza.\nTHe use of pre-start exec/script (in place of a regular exec/script) is so that when the script / executed command finishes, the job will still be considered running, whereas with a traditional exec/script the job is considered to be stopped when the exec/script exits.\nUsing task would be precisely what makes the job run twice (e.g. if the jobs you have are restarted), so we are leaving it out.\n", "Q: Downloading and installing files I'm pretty new to Ubuntu. When I first got my PC I tried downloading a client to play runescape on (Orion Pro) The file downloaded fully but never gave me an option to install? Also the same for java player. All I got was the downloaded file but no place to load the startup process, just a bunch if files which I really don't understand. If anyone could help with what I need to do that would be great.\n\nA: You've got a Windows mentality about installing files which you have to lose in order to succeed in installing files in Ubuntu. In general the extension suffix on the downloaded file will tell you how to install it.\nFirst of all you should search for the application you want in the Ubuntu Software Center. For example Java (OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime) can be installed from the Ubuntu Software Center.\nIf that doesn't work, files that end with the extension .deb are easy to install. Just double click on the .deb file and it will open for installation in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nTo install the RuneScape client in Ubuntu open the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the following commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:hikariknight/unix-runescape-client\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unix-runescape-client\n\nThese commands will work on all currently supported versions of Ubuntu. The ppa:hikariknight/unix-runescape-client is an Ubuntu Launchpad PPA (Personal Package Archive) for the RuneScape Unix Game Client. Packages installed from PPAs are not officially supported by Ubuntu, but adding the PPA to your software sources makes it possible to install packages from that PPA, either in the Ubuntu Software Center or from the terminal. The unix-runescape-client package is preconfigured to use the Java package from the Ubuntu Software Center by default.\nYou can also install generic Linux binary files in Ubuntu. These files are usually downloaded as an archive in various archive formats, the most common of which is the .tar.gz format. There will often be a file in the archive called INSTALL (or sometimes README) which contains the instructions for how to install the package from that archive. These instructions are sometimes explicit and easy to follow, but sometimes the installation instructions are incomplete or make unrealistic assumptions about the knowledge of the person who is installing the package, so it is easier to install the same package from a .deb file if there is one available.\n\nA: Welcome to ubuntu.\nYou need to be aware that Ubuntu is not Windows, and therefore will not run windows applications you download from the internet.\nBut don't worry. Most likely there are alternative software available for you.\ni don't know much about RuneScape, but Orion Pro seems to be a recording software. Check up on www.winehq.org for information about how to play RuneScape on Ubuntu.\nJava plugins are available in the software center, or from installing ubuntu-restricted-extras as follows:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nElse you can try installing icedtea java plugin with:\nsudo apt-get install icedtea-7-plugin\n\nThat should enable java support in your browsers at least.\n\nA: First of all, you should forget about Windows-style download an installer and install the software method. Ubuntu uses deb packages, mostly they are in repositories, so, you should install from there. \nPerhaps you are familiar with Android and Google Play: so, it is something similar. Locate Software Center in your Ubuntu system, and search there for the needed softwares.\nTime to time it happens that some software isn't in Software Center. Then you have to search for a PPA repository, add that and install from there. Just if none of the methods above didn't succeded, you can download and install from untrusted locations, but I think that this is not advisable for a beginner.\nTry to read and learn as much as possible about Ubuntu and Linux, because this is somehow a different world.\n", "Q: Skype version says it is older than it is OS: Ubuntu 12.04\nProblem: When I try to login to Skype, it says ¨cannot connect to server¨ - i understand that Skype no longer connects to server when the Skype version is less than 4.3, so my problem is as follows:\n\nSkype Version\nWhen I ask terminal for Skype version, it says the Skype version I have is 4.3\nBut when I open the Skype application (the only one available) it says it is version 4.0\nI have removed and reinstalled it but it just produces the same problem.\nHow do I solve this problem?\n- Thanks!\n\nA: Solution: Problem solved after installing software updates and then reinstalling Skype v4.3\n", "Q: After logging in my password does not work I'm running a fresh install of ubuntu 14.04 and I've got a strange problem.

I also cannot use the GUI to change my password as when I enter my existing password, it says it is incorrect. Also, if I lock my machine and try to log back in it claims my password is incorrect, but if I hit the switch user option and choose the same account, I can then enter my password and I get back in.\nAny ideas what is causing this?\nCheers\n\nA: Ignore me, found the problem ...

I have such a limited knowledge about this system that I don't even know where to start.\nEdit: I have blocked IPv6 and worked without dropbox, problem still occur. I have noticed that it's more likely to appear if I open 2-3 tabs at the same moment, or download update and at the same moment open tab; watch playlist on youtube so it download all the time..\nAny ideas how to fix it? I can't believe I have such a problems with linux from the very beginning.\nEdit2: should I maybe change my router settings? I have almost default from benkin.\nDynamic connection on channel 10, bandwidth 20/40, 802.11e/WMM QoS on; wpa-psk+wpa2+psk.\nEdit3: I had enough of it so I have reinstalled system. Same story, installed dropbox which was updating something, using internet and crash after 20sec.\nEdit4: I tried to play with MTU, no idea how to change it on my router but I learned that I should have 1472 (+28 = 1500). I added to /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf two lines:\ndefault interface-mtu 1500;\nsupercede interface-mtu 1500;\n\nIt didn't change anything. It seems like I'm trying to use too much internet (?). I made limit 1024 kb/s on dropbox and it works. However when I try to update information in \"incomplete language support\" it crushes..\n\nA: I had an issue with either my ISP or my router - don't really care which it was.  Ipv6 was not being handled well, and causing periodic disconnects.\nI disabled ipv6 according to instructions I found on itsfoss.com - The following lines are added to /etc/sysctl.conf\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\n\nThis is best done from a terminal:  press alt+ctrl+t to open a terminal window, and enter the command sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf to start an editor with the file open.  Add the lines by typing them, or copying them from here (shift+ctrl+v to paste), and press ctrl+o to write the file, and ctrl+x to exit the editor.  You will need to reboot for the changes to take effect.\nBecause I seem to be a little OCD, I also set IPV6 to IGNORE in the NM applet\n\nA: Try running this command in terminal:\niwconfig\n\nIf that shows power management: on you need to change it to off by running this command:\niwconfig [wifi-id] power off\n\n", "Q: A terminal based markdown editor that supports shortcuts I am looking for a terminal based markdown editor which support shortcut keys like ctrl+b which will output **enter bold text here** or something like that to the markdown file.

Here is what my output is when intel is rendering my desktop :\nBoth, the Benq and Medion monitor are activated correctly on start up.\nThe first thing, im not happy about, occurs when the login screen is showing.\nThe resolution of the smaller Medion monitor is correct.\nUnfortunately the Benq's screen is not completey in usage.There is unused space. I think only\nthe same 1400*900 pixels of the Medion resolution is copied on the bigger Benq screen.\nSo i would like both Monitors to have it's fullscreen preferred resoultion even on login.\nAfter i logged in correctly, both correct resolution are applied to the monitors.\n\nNitrogen - Issue is solved - looked at my Comment below!\nSo now i would like to use Nitrogen, a tool which makes it possible to have different wallpapers for earch screen.\nTake a look at this question!\n\nI installed and applied different wallpapers to both screens.\nOn Apply, nothing happens.\nI also made the startup command nitrogen --restore.\nThe funny thing is, both wallpapers are correctly shown on shutdown for a very short period of time.\n\nSo maybe the self approach of xorg , detecting the devices with correct resoultions is not enough. The xorg.conf is also empty.\nThats it with the intell issue.\n2. Here is what my output is when nvidia is rendering my desktop :\nRight now, when im just switch the gpu with \n    sudo prime-select nvidia && sudo shutdown -r now\n,\nthe well know dialog \" Ubuntu is running in low resoultion...\" is appearing.\nThough i can render a single screen for example my laptop screen correctly without an other external monitor turned on.\nWhen running nvidia-settings after pluggin in the hdmi and vga for both external monitors, i\nremember that nvidia is not detecting and showing both monitors.\nBut i can check that later @home.\nSo what i would love to have is :\nA correct configuration for both the intel gpu and nvidia gpu rendering my desktop.\nWhen the Intel Gpu is turned on :\nit should correctly detect and use both external Monitors, even on Login.\nNitrogen should work. Maybe its not working because the xorg.configuration is not a saved configuration in the xorg.conf.\nWhen my nvidia gpu i turned on. It should only use the bigger Benq monitor.\nThere shouldnt be any issue when switching between both configurations!\nI would like to have a saved configuration for both these situations.\nThe laptop is working like a desktop pc, so it will stay on my desk, being connected with the Medion and Benq Monitor via Hdmi and Vga.\nSo how can we solve this. I'm not afraid to write a own xorg.conf and nvidia config file with the help of you guys!\nFurthermore taking my latop on the couch shouldnt destroy a future xorg.conf file when no external monitor is connected.\nHere are the cases again:\nCase 1:\nLaptop is starting with both external Monitors connected and intel gpu rendering:\n-> use both external monitors and render correctly\nCase 2:\nLaptop is starting with both external Monitors connected and nvidia gpu rendering:\n-> use laptops screen only and render correctly.\nCase 3:\nLaptop is starting without any external Monitor connected and intel gpu rendering :\n-> use laptop screen only and render correctly :-D\nCase 4:\nLaptop is starting without any external Monitor connected and nvidia cpu rendering :\n-> use laptop screen only and render correctly :-D\nGoal is to achieve this nealy without any addional configuration between switching cases.It should all be saved in configuration files maybe...\nThanks a lot!!!

I am trying to change the ownership of a folder and subfolders by typing either of these:\nsudo chown $user -R /usr/bin/.folder/\nsudo chown $user -R /usr/bin/folder/\nsudo chown $user -R /usr/bin/.folder\nsudo chown $user -R /usr/bin/folder\n\nBut I get the output:\nchown: missing operand after '/usr/bin/.folder/'\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Please use $USER instead of $user.\nsudo chown $USER -R /usr/bin/.folder/\n\n\nA: The user variable is probably empty. Try $USER.\n\nA: Why Lower-Case $user Doesn't Work\nTo clarify and expand upon what others have said, shell and environment variables are case-sensitive. user and USER are different variables, so their contents (which $user and $USER expand to, respectively) may be different. Typically, no variable called user is defined and $user is expanded to nothing, while what you want is $USER which would expand to your username.\nThe echo command is usually suitable for checking the value of a variable:\n$ echo \"$user\"\n\n$ echo \"$USER\"\nek\n\nFor variables whose values don't contain any blank spaces, the quotes may be removed without affecting the output.\nSo I could've just used echo $USER if I wanted.\nAnother Option, for chown\nYou probably know your own username, so you can just use it in place of $USER. If you do this, make sure to omit the $ sign.\nFor example, since my username is ek, I could use:\nsudo chown ek -R /usr/bin/.folder/\n\nWhy You Get That Error\nYou might be wondering why you get the particular error message:\nchown: missing operand after '/usr/bin/.folder/'\n\nThat message actually is informative, in that when you see a message like that from a command where you expanded variables, it suggests one or more of your expanded variables may have been unintentionally empty or unset.\nYou ran sudo chown $user -R /usr/bin/.folder/, and since user was probably undefined, $user expanded to nothing and it was equivalent to running:\nsudo chown -R /usr/bin/.folder/\n\nThe -R option makes chown act on every file in a directory tree, as you probably know. Since $user expanded to nothing, /usr/bin/.folder/ was the first non-option argument to chown, and thus was interpreted as the argument specifying the desired ownership (such as a username). /usr/bin/.folder is not valid syntax for that, but that particular error went unreported because a different error stopped chown first: there were no more arguments, and so there was nothing specified for chown to operate on.\nTo put it another way, if I ran sudo chown $USER -R /usr/bin/.folder/, it would expand to sudo chown ek -R /usr/bin/.folder/ and chown would interpret its arguments this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*ek: username, since no username argument has been passed yet\n\n*-R: recursive option (the leading - is what makes chown know it's an option argument)\n\n*/usr/bin/.folder/: file or directory to change ownership on, since the username was already passed\n\n\nBut if I ran sudo chown $user -R /usr/bin/.folder, it would expand to sudo chown -R /usr/bin/.folder/ and chown would interpret its arguments this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*-R: recursive option\n\n*/usr/bin/.folder/: username, since no username argument has been passed yet\n\n\nFurther Reading\nFor more information, you may be interested in:\n\n\n*\n\n*BashGuide/CommandsAndArguments\n\n*BashGuide/Parameters\n\n*man chown\n", "Q: How do I replace multiple lines with single word in file(inplace replace)?

Can include captured regex groups by using $1 etc.\n\n*--passthru is needed since ripgrep usually only shows the lines matching the regex pattern. With this option it also shows all lines from the file that don't match.\n\n*--no-line-number / -N is because by default ripgrep includes the line numbers in the output (useful when only the matching lines are shown).\n\n*--multiline / -U enabled multiline processing since it's disabled by default.\n\n*--multiline-dotall is only needed if you want the dot ('.') regex pattern to match newlines (\\n).\n\n*> output.txt is needed since inline replace isn't supported. With the --passthrough and no-line-number options the standard output matches the desired new file with replacements and can be saved as usual.\n\nHowever, this command isn't as useful for processing multiple files, as it needs to be run separately per file.\n\nA: This can be done very easily in perl:\n$ perl -i -p0e 's/START.*?END/SINGLEWORD/s' file\n$ cat file\nMy block of line starts from here \nSINGLEWORD\nand end to here for example. \n\nExplanation\n-0 sets the line separator to null\n-p apply the script given by -e to each line and print that line\nThe regexp modifier:\n\n\n*\n\n*/s Treat string as single line. That is, change . to match any character whatsoever, even a newline, which normally it would not match.\n\n\nWhy the ?:\n\n\n*\n\n*By default, a quantified subpattern is \"greedy\", that is, it will match as many times as possible (given a particular starting location) while still allowing the rest of the pattern to match. If you want it to match the minimum number of times possible, follow the quantifier with a ?. \n\n\nA: I was wondering if this is possible without perl, python and others. And I found this solution using sed:\n$ sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/START.*END/SINGLEWORD/g' filename\n\nExplanation:\n\n*\n\n*:a create a label 'a'\n\n*N append the next line to the pattern space\n\n*$! if not the last line, ba branch (go to) label 'a'\n\n*s substitute, /START.*END/ by SINGLEWORD,/g global match (as many times as it can)\nIt was found here.\n", "Q: How do I change guest session alert message When a guest user logs in, they get an alert message saying \"All data created during this guest session...\".

There are quite a few themes in the Ubuntu Software Center, which you can download. Changing the cursor is easiest with Unity Tweak Tool, at least IMHO. \nSecond, about the certain region. Oxygen cursor themes, which I installed just now, look just as show in screen shot in the Ubuntu Software Center, but when I hover the pointer over task launcher or drop down menu in firefox, it changes appearance to default.

So I changed that to \\n.\n\n*In the text with \"-e\" and \"\\n\", the \\ is intended to be printed literally rather than to combine with the n following it and produce a newline. So I quoted (escaped) \\ with another \\. If \\n produces a new line, \\\\n produces \\n.\n\n*I replaced the outer double quotes (\") with single quotes ('). You wanted the \" characters around -e and \\n to be printed literally, but instead they ended and restarted quoting, preventing them from being printed and causing \\n to actually be printed as n (because an unquoted \\n is processed before being passed to echo). An alternative solution would have been to write \\\" for the inside \" characters. But there was no reason to enclose the whole thing in double quotes--single quotes are usually preferable in cases where either can be used.\nThe other change--which was not a change in the final command but was a change I made just while working on it--was that I removed the >> note.txt redirection until I knew I had the command right. By sending output to the terminal, I was immediately able to see what the effect was. I re-added the redirection when I was done.\nThat's stylistically closest to what you already had, but it's not the only way to do it.\nWay 2: Separate echo commands for separate lines, instead of using -e.\nSince the only sequence you want treated specially by echo is the \\n (between text and on), you can just use two separate echo commands and (as muru may be suggesting) not use -e.\nHere are two ways of redirecting the output of multiple commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two separate redirections, one for each command.\necho 'writes (>> appends) in note.txt this text' >> note.txt\necho 'on 2 lines (with \"-e\" and \"\\n\" help)' >> note.txt\n\nIf the filename is long or you're writing a script and only want to have to change it in one place, you can assign it to a variable:\nout=\"/home/ek/Documents/long name that can have spaces as it's quoted/note.txt\"\necho 'writes (>> appends) in note.txt this text' >> \"$out\"\necho 'on 2 lines (with \"-e\" and \"\\n\" help)' >> \"$out\"\n\n\n*A single redirection applied to a compound command composed of the two commands.\n{\n    echo 'writes (>> appends) in note.txt this text'\n    echo 'on 2 lines (with \"-e\" and \"\\n\" help)'\n} >> note.txt\n\nYou can put that on one line if you like, but if there's no newline before the closing brace (}), a semicolon (;) must precede it:\n{ echo 'writes (>> appends) in note.txt this text'; echo 'on 2 lines (with \"-e\" and \"\\n\" help)'; } >> note.txt\nWay 3: Pass a literal \\n to echo instead of using -e.\nReal newlines can appear inside quotes (single or double) and are interpreted literally:\necho 'writes (>> appends) in note.txt this text\non 2 lines (with \"-e\" and \"\\n\" help)' >> note.txt\n\nBecause the first line ends inside quotes, the shell doesn't take it as the end of the command, but instead continues reading.\nIf you do want to fit it on a single line, you can use $'\\n', which expands to a newline. This is expanded by the shell before being passed to the echo command, so it should not be quoted.\necho 'writes (>> appends) in note.txt this text'$'\\n''on 2 lines (with \"-e\" and \"\\n\" help)' >> note.txt\nWay 4: Use printf\nprintf is very powerful; there are a number of ways you could use it to solve this problem. Since I am presenting this as a distinct solution from the others, here's a good way to use it in a way you cannot use echo:\nprintf '%s\\n%s\\n' 'writes (>> appends) in note.txt this text' 'on 2 lines (with \"-e\" and \"\\n\" help)' >> note.txt\n\nThe general syntax for printf is printf format args... (where args... means zero or more additional command-line arguments). The format string above, %s\\n%s\\n, means:\n\n\n*\n\n*%s: consume and print the next unused (i.e., first) argument in args... (i.e., your 1st line).\n\n*\\n: print a newline.\n\n*%s: consume and print the next unused (i.e., second) argument in  args... (i.e., your 2nd line).\n\n*\\n: print a newline.\n\n\nWhen there are more arguments after the format string than the format string calls for, the printf command starts over from the beginning of the format string. Thus, while less self-documenting, you could actually write just '%s\\n' (instead of '%s\\n%s\\n') for the format string, and it would produce the same output in this case.\nI will not attempt to broadly document printf here. Instead, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*The output of help printf.\n\n*The printf subsection of 4.2 Bash Builtin Commands in the bash reference manual.\n\n*This manual page, documenting the standard printf command (which bash slightly extends).\n\n*The printf() function in the standard C library, which the printf command is based on, and which is referred to explicitly in the above resources. Documentation on it, such as this page, is both more thorough and more accessible than most sources on the printf command. And the format string syntax is very similar.\n\n\nWay 5: Use cat and a here document.\nThis way is especially valuable when there's a lot of input, and when scripting. If you're using the shell interactively rather than writing a script, you can use this, but please consider Way 6 below first.\nWhile echo and printf print text based on the contents of their command-line arguments, cat prints the contents of its input files (as specified on the command line) or, if given none (or passed -), its standard input.\nWith no redirections, standard input is what you type on a program's controlling terminal. Here documents are a special kind of redirection. Lines are collected until a specified keyword (I've used EOF) appears by itself on a line. Then the lines up to but not including EOF (or whatever you used) are given as standard input to the command being run.\ncat >> note.txt << EOF\nwrites (>> appends) in note.txt this text\non 2 lines (with \"-e\" and \"\\n\" help)\nEOF\n\nOne of the differences between quoting with \" and ' is that most expansions and substitutions with $ (e.g., $varname) are performed in double quotes, but none are in single quotes. There are also two ways to use here documents, based on whether $ (and also ` and \\) are to be given special meaning or treated literally.\nIn this case, it doesn't matter--$ and ` don't appear, and \\ is only treated specially in a here document when it escapes a shell metacharacter (not n). Just as in single and double quoted expressions, both ways treat \\n literally. (Remember, you had to use a special feature of echo, turned on by -e, to get \\n treated specially.)\nBut so you know for other applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*The way shown above will perform expansions and substitutions, treating $, `, and \\ specially when they appear in a context where their special meaning applies.\n\n*To cause all text to be treated literally, quote all or part of the word appearing to the right of << with ', \", \\, or a combination thereof (e.g., cat >> note.txt << 'EOF').\n\n\nWay 6: Use cat without any input redirection.\nIf you're using the shell interactively, by default the shell's standard input is taken from your terminal. When you then run a program, by default that program's standard input is taken from your terminal too. (This may be changed by input redirections, of course.)\nSo if you're running a command interactively and want to use cat with >> or > output redirection to send data to a file, you don't need any input redirection. Just enter:\ncat >> note.txt\nwrites (>> appends) in note.txt this text\non 2 lines (with \"-e\" and \"\\n\" help)\n^D\nIn place of ^D, don't enter a literal ^D. Instead, press Ctrl+D. That signals to your terminal that it should report end of file (i.e., that when the running program asks for more input, it is told that there is none left, just as if it had reached the end of a regular file stored on disk). When cat sees there's no more input, it exits, and you are returned to the shell.\nIf you're writing a script, Way 6 will not work, because bash reads commands from a file but standard input is still (typically) a something else, such as your terminal.\nOne notable difference between using cat with a here document and using cat with no input redirection, even when standard input is your terminal, is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*cat >> note.txt writes one line at a time to note.txt. Each time you press Enter, a line is written to note.txt.\n\n*cat >> note.txt << EOF takes all input up to the EOF line, then appends it to note.txt. If you interrupt the input by pressing Ctrl+C, nothing is written (and if note.txt didn't exist already, it is not even created).\n\n\nA: Well, I hope this satisfies your needs:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Press, Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type, in the following command:\nnano  \n\n*An editor in the terminal would open for you.  \n\n*Type in whatever you want, in your case:\necho -e 'writes(>> appends) in note.txt this text/non 2lines (with \"-e\" and \"\\n\" help)' >> note.txt (that's what I got from your question)  \n\n*To Save and Exit,\n\n*\n\n*Press, Ctrl+X\n\n*Will ask for a confirmation message to save, press y\n\n*Type, a name for your file, press Enter\n\n\n*To Check,\n\n*\n\n*Open File Manager, you'll see a file that you saved.  \n\n*You'll, probably find all your text (including, \"\\n\")\n\n\n\nA: The shell interperlates special characters like the backslash, except when it's surrounded by single quotes.\necho takes arguments beginning with dash, so to be extra safe, you should use printf instead, like this:\n$ printf %s 'A \\n B \\n'\nA \\n B \\n\n\n%s just means print the string I'm passing as an argument. It's often used like this:\n$ variable=Flimm\n$ printf '%s is all right\\n' \"$variable\"\nFlimm is all right\n\nYou can find out more about the Bash's interpolation in the manpage for the bash command , search for the section entitled QUOTING. Also look at the manpage for the printf command .\n\nA: The character \\ is also an escape character for itself, so you can add an additional \\ like so:\nmgodby@mg-ws1:~$ echo -e '\\n'\n\n\nmgodby@mg-ws1:~$ echo -e '\\\\n'\n\\n\nmgodby@mg-ws1:~$ \n\n\nA: one more way:\n\nperl -e 'print q{\nthis preserves \\n backslash-n\nand other special characters except close-squiggle \n(without a matching open-squiggle, which would be very rare)\n}' > note.txt\n\nif your note has a close-squiggle you can chose another delimeter to the q() function:\n\nperl -e 'print q|\n\nthis works even with an unmatched close-squiggle\nlike this one: }\n\nbut it doesnt workt if i have a pipe in my text...\n\n|' > note.txt\n\n\nof course all these methods (perl or native printf) will fail if you have\na single-quote inside your document. in this case you may be able to use\ndouble-quotes (so long as you dont have both single and double inside your text) eg\n\n\nprintf %s \" I'm an idiot\"\n\n\n", "Q: Installing drivers for windows?

It is \"TRIM-ready\" and the kernel comes with an fstrim executable in /etc/cron.weekly.\nI nevertheless wanted to run the test, say, out of curiosity.

How can a 1MB file be so heavily fragmented ? \n\nA: After snooping around and readings on the matter of TRIM and fragmentation, answering my own question might be of help to others.\nReading about TRIM, frequent references to file fragmentation are made. Both aspects are the source of legitimate questions about SSD storage performance, however the 2 issues are distinct.\n\n\n*\n\n*file fragmentation consists in one file being written to HDD or SSD in many different non-contiguous write-areas, using physical blocks distributed over the storage medium within a partition. In the particular context of SSDs, we will see it has nothing to do with TRIM's actions or even with TRIM's level of storage management, but that it is related to wear-leveling (WL), another process for low level storage medium management always present in SSDs (unlike TRIM). Internal data management in SSDs is fundamentally different from that of HDDs in its assignment o sectors to non-volatile flash memory cells (i.e. SSD's cells)  and their corresponding blocks (flash blocks). It has a direct incidence on file fragmentation.  \n\n*TRIM prepares at-least-once written physical blocks on an SSD for new write operations (Wops), obviating the need to actually erase the targeted blocks immediately before the Wop occurs (as would be the case in a setup w/o TRIM). For that the SSD must have a hardware controller that is TRIM-ready. It is not always the case. After the first phase of use (i.e. when the SSD is still relatively new and all its blocks have not yet been written over at least once), Wops slow down until they reach a speed plateau. At that stage, a rule of thumb is that TRIM approximately halves write-times on TRIM-ready SSDs with respect to the same hardware without TRIM enabled.\n\n\nDuring Wops, SSDs behave quite differently from HDDs. An HDD will never need erasing of a block prior to a Wop. An SSD always does and that is time consuming. TRIM helps alleviate that time consumption by pre-conditioning recently freed blocks on the TRIM-capable SSD, essentially by pre-erasing blocks that are freed after a file was modified and moved to a different area of the volume. This is a simplified view of reality, but one that the non-expert user can roughly rely on to begin to make decision about hardware and low level hardware administration. Read on...\nIs TRIM related to SSD's fragmentation ?\n- Short answer: No, they are not related.\n- Long answer: Fragmentation is related to wear-leveling (WL), yet another process that optimizes the life span of SSDs. WL is essential to homogenize Wops over the whole SSD's free/available/unreserved block space inside a volume/partition. It does so, because each Wop makes the corresponding SSD's cells age, through the application of a relatively large voltage over a tiny area of semiconductor layer, thereby reducing its life span. (I believe, this has to do with thermal induced defects introduced in the bulk of the SSD, but that's off-topic.)   \nIf Wops were managed on SSDs as they are on HDDs, certain areas of the storage medium would wear out long before others, leading to non-operable blocks, loss of capacity , loss of data and errors. WL actually ensures that all blocks in any given SSD's partition are subjected to the same amount of Wops and that the wear is \"leveled out\" over the entire SSD's available partition space. In that sense, it effectively increases the life span of the SSD, while maintaining its full capacity until its demise.\nThere are two WL modes: static and dynamic. This wiki (in German) specifies that write-cycle counts at SSD's end of life may increase 100 fold for static and 25 fold for dynamic WL as compared to the same hardware with WL turned off.  \nAs WL physically distributes Wops (the limiting parameter that defines the life span of SSDs) as uniformly as possible over the entire SSD's storage space inside a partition, it will inevitably contribute to its data fragmentation. It does so, in order to achieve its prime objective of optimized distribution of written blocks throughout any given SSD's partition. The uptake is that any file stored on an SSD may be fragmented quite a bit more than it would on a traditional HDD. Fragmentation however does not translate in any performance decline for the SSD.\nHow WL operates has other corollaries: the bigger the SSD volume, the greater its life span for given conditions of use. For the user, \"conditions of use\" mean primarily:\n       - the amount of used space on an SSD's partition and\n       - Wop's frequency, i.e. how heavily write-accessed is the storage medium.\nThis actually may speak in favor of :\n       - placing the lx swap, /home, /tmp and /var on an HDD, while the rest of the OS may live on happily on a smaller SSD.\n       - not making any partitions with a lot of Wops too small on an SSD. For instance if swap must be on an SSD and you read that the lx-swap is best set at twice your DRAM size, make it 4 times. I don't know whether my arythmetic is right, but the general idea is that this will also more or less double your swap space life-span. If you conduct a lot of operation that require swapping (servers with heavy usage DB, etc.), think about moving your swap and /tmp onto an HDD, unless you like the idea of taking a gas burner to your SSD of course.\nMeanwhile TRIM prepares SSD's blocks for any upcoming new Wop. It pre-conditions once written cells for a new Wop by erasing those cells (actually the operation occurs at the level of a block) and starting garbage collection when needed. In that sense TRIM keeps an eye on the distribution map of newly freed (and at least once used) blocks as they are being low-level managed by the WL controller.\nConclusion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fragmentation is no matter. It is not detrimental to the SSD's performance. SSDs do not need (see Intel's talk on SSDs) nor do they benefit from housekeeping in the form of defragmentation. Whatever your OS, turn defrag off. Now.  \n\n*TRIM is important and beneficial, provided the SSD is TRIM ready. Today a handful of brands provide TRIM capable SSDs. If you have read this thread from the beginning you know the name of at least one of those reputable brands. Also few years ago, ext2 was considered the better option over ext3 because journaling actually went against some of the benefits brought about by TRIM when using 1st generation SSDs.

I've seen multiple tutorials on it, but none of them are very easy. They all involve multiple scripts and ppas (not that there's anything inherently wrong with that).\nThis is an issue I've been following closely for many years but I'm just so surprised that it still isn't supported natively.\nSo where does the difficulty lie in natively being able to set a GIF as a background? Or is it rather due to lack of demand, than difficulty?\n\nA: Animated GIF has much worse compression-to-quality ratio than video file. Using animated GIF where a video could be used instead is discouraged. With the onset of HTML5 and video support in Web, animated GIFS should be forgotten totally. \n", "Q: How to use MAAS to render I want to build a cluster for rendering my projects i do in Blender 3D. I do not want to use the network render addon because it is a little bit boring and it also can not support single image. So I want to render via the machines that Maas starts and installs..\nIs Ubuntu MAAS the right tool for that?\nAnd how do I have to set it up?\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: This is answering the question independent of Blender 3D, assuming  rendering in general.\n(The answer was started before an edit of the question adding the reference to Blender 3D) \nMAAS is a system to manage a cluster in a dynamic way.  \nIt is helpful if you often change \nyour cluster hardware,  or the services deployed on it, or the instances running on it.\nFor the problem you are solving, that feature set seems to be not very relevant:\nI assume you want to build one cluster. That will consist of a fixed set of rougly uniform hardware nodes, that may change infrequently. You want to run one parallel application software on it, so you require one instance of a render service on each node.\nThe tasks where MAAS could help are the initial setup of the nodes, the deployment of the render service, and changing the cluster, like when adding another node.\nBut in these tasks, there is neither much repetition, nor much dynamism - the areas where MAAS is powerful.  \nBecause of that, I think the overhead of using MAAS is probably larger than the advantages for your task.\nIt seems to make more sense to directly set up just the cluster; This gives you the freedom to choose the kind of cluster software based on the needs of your application.\n", "Q: LAN networking problem I have 7 PC with Ubuntu 14.04 on them.

My Ubuntu username is gadu. Until today, i've always used the following command:\nsudo ./gadumaster\n\nand entered my password (gadumaster is the application accessing the USB). This command was working, as well as a call to system function reboot() used to restart my laptop when certain external condition from USB occurred.\nToday I had to change things so this application runs automatically after laptop starts up. Therefore i prepared a script file, and searched a way how to pass the password to the script. After reading few articles I decided to allow access to USB for my user by adding it to dialout group:\n\nsudo adduser gadu dialout\n\nAfter rebooting I was able to start my application by simply typing:\n\n./gadumaster\n\nThis was excellent, but I needed a way to enable also reboot() function. What was my surprise when i figured out that the following command is not working any more:\n\nsudo ./gadumaster\n\nYes, executing the application with sudo gives me error \"Permission denied\" when connecting to USB! Note that without sudo it works! \nTried to remove my user from dialout group:\n\nsudo deluser gadu dialout\n\nAfter rebooting I got into situation that both with sudo and without sudo commands are not working!

This is not an issue with the USB connection anymore. \nYou can resolve this by rebuilding your application or by changing the file permissions via chmod 775 gadumaster (or similar) and/or chown $USER gadumaster (you can replace $USER with the user supposed to \"own\" the file).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 w/ Unity - java application gui does not show When I open certain java-powered applications, the primary GUI will not show up. However, the GUI windows for misc functions such as the \"Tips and Tricks\" type windows, project creation, save dialog boxes (shown when I use right click the program icon and close the application), etc will appear properly.\nI initially saw these symptoms whilst attempting to use the program \"yEd\" and dismissed it as an issue with yEd itself and Ubuntu compatibility. However, I attempted to install and run \"projectlibre\" using the .deb package from its sourceforge page, and it also is having the same issues.\nHere is some rudimentary diagnostic information that I have gathered regarding the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*The issue is present within the Unity interface\n\n*The applications work fine within xfce on the same distro (Ubuntu 14.04)\n\n*XMind (another java-based application) works fine when installed from .deb\n\n*The following programs are known to have this issue:\n\n*\n\n*yEd\n\n*ProjectLibre\n\n\n*The following java versions have been tested without success:\nmgodby@mgodby-nb1:~$ update-java-alternatives -l\njava-1.6.0-openjdk-amd64 1061 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-amd64\njava-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64 1071 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64\njava-7-oracle 1072 /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle\n\nAll of this tells me that the problem most likely lies in the way that Unity abstracts java application GUIs, but I cannot figure out what is wrong and why xmind works while yEd and ProjectLibre fail.\n\nA: Maybe this has been solved for you already, but I just ran into the same problem (Ubuntu 14.04, yEd & Unity). I have no idea what causes the problem, but the following workaround worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the running yEd using the icon in Unity's sidebar.\n\n*Hit Alt+Space. This should show the window menu, but for me it came up empty.\n\n*Hit the up or down arrow key. This should show the menu items.\n\n*Select Maximize.\n\n\nThis way I was able to bring up the yEd window, after that it worked for me.\n", "Q: Clusters and HDDs As a student, I run a cluster using ubuntu server in my college.\nAs you may already know, each computer of this cluster, have HDDs, and I'd like to create one single HDD for the cluster...\nI'm talking about something like a virtual HDD, that have all the hdd clusters as a single one.\nThe problem is, I can't find much on the internet... and I don't know how to search for it exactly (the right words for a good search).\nCould someone help me?\n\nA: Network filesystems\nI assume it's about a compute cluster consisting of consumer PC hardware - there is no load balancing or high availability involved\nIn general terms, what you are looking for is a network filesystem.\nTechnically, a network filesystem consists of a daemon on the server which has the real harddisk,\nand software on the client machines that provides something like a \"virtual harddisk\" on the client;\nThe software makes it look like there is a local harddisk, but accessing it will be redirected to the harddisk on the server.\nImplementations\nThere are many implementations of network filesystems:\nnfs\nA common implementation used under Linux is nfs\nIt is well suited for \"general\" uses in the default configuration; For your use case, it may be relevant that it provides lots of options to tune it for specific needs, because a cluster with a given load may have very unusual harddisk access patterns.\nSee How to set an NFS network? and Setting up NFS HowTo.\nsshfs\nAn alternative to nfs could be sshfs. It provides a filesystem on the client using the normal sshd, which allows remote logins by ssh and file operations by scp.\nCompared to nfs, it may be slower in general, but on the other hand it's much easier to manage, and the server side sshd, is usually available by default.\nSMB/CIFS\nAnother alternative is SMB, commonly used with Windows, implemented by samba.\nCluster specific filesystems\nBecause the network filesystem used in a cluster can have a big influence on the performance, the network filesystem is an important part in the design of high performance clusters. To maximize performance for specific classes cluster aplications, various specialized cluster filesystems exist. These can also handle data in other structures than filesystem trees, or provide unusual file locking services.\n", "Q: Do I need to Install jdk?

Therefore, first dissect the error message. It says:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\ncuda : Depends: cuda-6-5 (= 6.5-14) but it is not going to be installed.\n\nSo cuda has a dependency cuda-6-5, which can not be installed.

This I can see in the \"Disks\" util. Currently it is unformatted. \nI am slowly understanding that \"/\" is the mother of all directories and everything else sits under that. I attempted to create a separate /home on the install which would have been on the mirror. I kept getting ??? ??? as the error though :-( even though I setup a swap and / on the SSD.\nThat all aside what I would like to do is format this mirror so that all users on the system can access this drive and can create folders. Once they have created folders I would like them to be able to control permissions so only they have access to them so they can be shared on the network with Win7/OSX and Ubuntu machines but from being logged in as them.\nThe issue I've been having is if I format the mirror under the first and only created user on the system it say's that only I have access to it and nothing else can. When I created two folders for home directories it created them but I could not login. So I created them on the SSD which logged me in fine. I then attempted to access the formatted mirror again and nobody else could access it still.\nMoving on I formatted it in root which was great as everyone could see it but nobody could access it still. From my reading it looks like it has to be mounted at /media\nI am stuck now and I'm sure somebody on here can do this in their sleep which I am currently depleted of. I am not sure on the professional way to do this.\nAll you help vey much appreciated so thank you.   \n\nA: If I understand correctly, what you want is moving the /home folder to your RAID disk. In that way, users would have a directory (their $HOME directory) in which they could do everything they want.\nIn case you understand not fully how it works, Unix has a standard directory tree, created on installation under the root /. By default, all this is created on the boot disk or device, but you can dispatch those folders on different disks or partitions. These are permanent mountpoints, you can fetch them in the file /etc/fstab\nThe important point is the system needs these folders to work correctly. On the contrary, some disks or network shares can be added (mounted) on the system temporarily. These must be located somewhere in the directory tree, and most often, the /media folder is used for it. This folder is dedicated to temporary mounts like CDs or USB disks. But things like NFS shares can be mounted anywhere.\nNow, if you want to create this configuration (/home folder on your RAID disk), the easiest and safest way is to do it during system installation. It can be done too on an existing installation, but it's a much more risky business.\n", "Q: Existing 14.04 repair going on for 20 hours. Should I abort? A couple of months ago a Windows 8.1 update locked out my existing Ubuntu 14.04. Had to let it rest for several weeks because of work issues.

This little program shows up on login, and you type the name of any app that you wanna start. \nOption 3: Classic menu.\nIn software center download Classic Ubuntu Menu. It's an equivalent of start menu in Windows XP, and lists almost all programs you installed on Ubuntu. \nOption 4 : Configure File Manager in Edit-> Properties -> Behavior to \"Run executable text files when they are opened. \" That way, you can make a scrip to open this program in xterm or another terminal emulator. \nSo having changed file manager behavior, create a new text file on desktop , and open with your favourite text editor. For me that's nano, so i would type in terminal:\nnano ~/Desktop/Shortcut_Script.sh \n\nAnd in this script file put the following lines\n#!/bin/bash\n\nxterm -hold -e \" /path/to/your/program/java -cp jts.jar:total.2013.jar -Xmx512M -XX:MaxPermSize=128M jclient.LoginFrame \"\n\nA small explanation here: this script basically calls xterm window, tells it to stay on (hold), and execute the commands enclosed by double quotes. From reading your question, I understand that you first need to navigate to the right folder, and then call the program, right ? So /path/to/your/program/ part should let you call that program in the right folder, while staying in the original start folder for xterm (which is your home/user folder). Now, if this does not work, and you do need to navigate to the folder, what you can do is this:\nxterm -hold -e \" cd /path/to/your/program/ ; java -cp jts.jar:total.2013.jar -Xmx512M -XX:MaxPermSize=128M jclient.LoginFrame \"\n\nNotice the semicolon.

New to Ubuntu. Need help on how to install Flash and Java.\n\nA: So here's my new and improved answer. Let me know if this is clear enough and helpful enough.\nRule of thumb, or how installing software works on Ubuntu\nWhen it comes to software in Ubuntu, the Software Center program is you big and bubbly friend. There's , of-course other ways to install software, such as apt-get tool and dpkg tool. But for someone who's just starting with Ubuntu, Software Center should be simple enough solution.\nFirst, Java \nWhen you initially install Ubuntu and go to youtube, you realize that you need flash player, but once you go to install it , the adobe website will tell you that you need java. So the first thing you need is Java (obviously). There's two options here, Java that has been developed by Oracle, or free and open-source OpenJDK. The last one is simplest to install, and sufficient for most users' needs. Simply open Software Center, and type java. Select OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime and click install. Same thing with IcedTea Java Web Start. \n\nNow, the small problem is that you need to enable Java in Firefox , if that's the browser you prefer. To do that, I use QuickJava add-on (because I'm lazy).  Simply type in firefox address bar about:addons, and it will open add-ons page. Search for QuickJava, install it, and once you got it, find it in the Extensions menu, click preferences, and check boxes bellow the things you want to be enabled in Firefox.\n\nMoving on to flash\nSo now you are ready to install Adobe Flash player. This can be done in two ways: through their website:  http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/  or through Software Center. Since this is a proprietary type of software, you probably might want to tell your Ubuntu to allow installing proprietary or copyrighted software. To do that go to System Settings -> Software & Updates ( under System ) , and check the boxes next to \"Software restricted by copyright or legal issues(multiverse)\"\n\nOnce you got that, like I said, you can download Flash through their website, or go to software center.\n\nThe small problem with flash player is that version 11.2 will be last one that Adobe developed for Linux, even though they will still provide support. There are alternatives to Adobe's flash player, such as Gnash and Lightspark. I've never tried them personally, but there's quite a few positive reviews of them. Again, they are in Software Center.\n\nChrome and Chromium\nNow, installing flash player is a good idea, but if you want to avoid hustle, installing Google Chrome or Chromium is even better idea. They come pre-packaged with their own flavor of flash player. What's the difference between Chrome and Chromium ? Visually - there's no difference. Chromium is the open-source project from which Chrome and Chrome OS took jumpstart. As it is an open-source project, it is community maintained, while Chrome will have all the newest features, but it's controlled by Google. \nAs far as Chromium goes, it's simple - search Chromium in Software Center and install it. \nNow, Google Chrome is a bit trickier. You have to go to the website: \"https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/#eula\" and download installer package.\n\nDo you see where it says 32 bit .deb and 64 bit deb ? OK. Like  FuzzyToothpaste mentioned in his answer, 32 and 64 bit refer to which OS you have. Most likely you know that (after all, for installing Ubuntu you need to decide to install either 32 or 64 bit OS, based on your RAM memory ) , but if do not know that, open System Settings -> Details (same line as Software & Updates), and it should give you a summary for your system, and specifically you are interested in OS Type line.\n\nDeb packages are sort of like zip for Windows. Once you are done downloading , drag and drop it into Software Center window, and it should open it. Alternatively, when your download starts, click \"Open with \" and it should have software center already selected.\n\nWhat else to know\nUbuntu out of the box works perfectly fine, just needs  some small tuning. For instance, on 14.04 LTS version, it ships with muted audio. I've encountered this strange thing with some other members of askubuntu, as well as when I installed Ubuntu on Acer C720 chromebook, and upgrading from 13.10 on my Toshiba laptop. The solution is to open something called Terminal ( Ctrl + Alt +T ) or command line, and open alsamixer, which is like a sound manager. For more info you can refer to my answer here, on another askubuntu question.\nAnother thing: many codecs are proprietary, which means you have to install some ; so you'd need to get \"Ubuntu Restricted Extras\" in the . . .  .yes, Software Center. Did I say, it's your best friend when it comes to software?\nTweaking Ubuntu's look and feel can be done with one great app called Unity Tweak Tool. It gives you way to tweak theme, cursor, launcher and icon size, etc. \nAnother app that I really love, is Ubuntu Classic Menu. Basically , it's a drop down menu, similar to Windows XP's start menu, and it lists all software you installed by categories, so you don't need to search for stuff. \nWhile Ubuntu is pretty fast, you might want to make it just a notch faster. Here is a great article that explains some of the methods to improve your boot speed and program start speed.\nLinux has pretty much evolved over years, and now it's pretty user friendly. But since this is Linux/Unix type of system, I suggest you start getting acquainted with command line (aka Terminal). Many troubleshootings have to be done through command line, so at least have general idea. If you are a programmer/engineer who is starting to learn Linux - then you just must learn command line. Right now I'm reading Ubuntu Toolbox, which is really a good , general guide to starting out with Ubuntu, and command line over all. Don't be lazy , and invest into some reading, and that should get you started with Ubuntu in no time.\nGood luck !\n\nA: Well, I'm going to assume you want Google Chrome, which is the only way to get Adobe Flash 15 on Ubuntu. First, open up a terminal and type uname -p. That will tell you your processor architecture. If you already know it, skip this. If it says x86_64, you have a 64-bit processor (remember that for later). If you get iX86, where X can be 3, 4, 5, or 6, you have a 32-bit processor (remember that). If you get x86, that also means you have a 32-bit processor (it goes without saying, but remember that). Then use any old web browser like Mozilla Firefox or Midori to go to https://google.com/chrome and click the big blue \"Download now\" button. You'll see a box pop up asking you to choose from four different versions of Chrome. You want one of the top two (the .deb files) depending on if you're 32 or 64 bit. Click the appropriate radio button, scroll down, read the license agreement (like anybody ever does) and choose \"Accept and Install\". In some browsers, including Mozilla Firefox, you will be asked whether you would like to open or save the file. Choose \"Save\" or something similar depending on your browser. Let it download. Once it has completed downloading, open your file browser (Nautilus a.k.a. Files, Dolphin, Thunar, etc.) and go to your Downloads folder or where ever the file was downloaded to. Right-click on the file, move down in the menu to \"Open With...\" and choose \"Ubuntu Software Center\", \"Muon\", or \"GDebi\", whichever appears. Click \"Install\" and follow the instructions to install the file. Once it has been installed, you have successfully downloaded Google Chrome and Adobe Flash Player, but Adobe Flash Player will only work in Google Chrome. Now that's taken care of, let's move on to Java.\nI'm assuming that by Java, you mean Java Runtime Environment. The only other option is the Java Development Kit and, unless you are a programmer that knows Java, you won't ever need. There are two kinds of Java Runtime Environments. Well, made by two different people. One is Oracle Java. It's hard to install and is proprietary, meaning it has a strict license agreement that restricts your use of it. The other is OpenJDK. It has less bugs, easier to install, and is free and open source software. OpenJDK is clearly the better choice, so I'll help you get set up with the OpenJDK Java Runtime Environment. Open up a terminal again and type in cat /etc/issue and press Enter. This will give you your Ubuntu version. If you get \"Ubuntu Trusty Tahr\", type the following command: sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre icedtea-plugin -y. If you get \"Ubuntu Utopic Unicorn\", type in sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre icedtea-plugin -y. If you get \"Ubuntu Precise Pangolin\" or something else, update your verison of Ubuntu. When you enter those commands, you will be asked for the super-use rpassword. This is not always your password. For information, contact your system administrator. One last note, the Java plugin you installed (runs Java applets in browser) works in every browser EXCEPT for Google Chrome. Don't worry about it. You probably won't need it.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall a font installed using gnome-font-viewer?

The available USB devices should be offered on right click in the filters.\n", "Q: Accidentally formatted ext4 partition I have just formatted an ext4 partition to fat32 using gparted.\nIn which directions should I tread in my attempt to recover?\n\nA: I made the silly mistake of formatting a partition by accident.  I was installing a linux distribution called crunchbang on my netbook, so I don't have to bring my laptop to class every week.  I was intending to format a USB flash drive for this purpose, when, to my dismay, I formatted an ext4 partition containing over 500gb of data to fat32.  This is a summary of what I've learned:\nIf a filesystem is damaged, you can attempt to recover that filesystem itself, or individual files.  Individual file recovery is possible regardless of the state of the filesystem, but it has the drawback of being almost completely useless if you are dealing with a lot of data.  When you recover individual files, you are going to LOSE the ENTIRE directory structure of your data (that means organisation and filenames).  In my case, this was completely useless, as it would take me years to sift through and rename all those music files and other junk.  Also, In many cases the program will fail to find specific start and end blocks for your file (this is almost always the case with plain text files) and you could end up (like me) with each mp3 file split into a hundred 1-5 second pieces.\nREAD this all the way through before attempting anything... (you will find instructions for making an image of your disk at the bottom, but it should be done first)\nIf you are in a different situation (like recovering a very small amount of data or looking for a specific searchable piece of data), than individual file recovery could be an option for you.\nThe free utilities I found for this are:\nPhotoRec\nand\nForeMost\n(both are in the ubuntu repositories for your convenience)\n\nIf your intent is to recover an entire partition, then you should look towards a piece of software called TestDisk.  This is also in the ubuntu repositories, and It has a nice curses GUI to make things easier.\nTestDisk is compatable with all kinds of filesystems including ext2/3/4, ntfs, fat, and others.. (and the binary is released in Windows as well as UNIX compatible versions)\nUnfortunately after hours with this utility, TestDisk was able to find my old partition, but the root inode was destroyed, so I gave up on using TestDisk and decided to try to recover the ext backup superblock manually.\n\nIf your concern is a linux ext2/3/4 partition, then you will find these to utilities helpful (they will most certainly already be on your linux machine)\nthis will be used to calculate where the backup superblocks will be located in the event you were to create a ext filesystem on the partition in question\nmke2fs (make extended 2 file-system) for ext2/3/4\nthis will be used to attempt to restore the filesystem using one of the backup superblocks\ne2fsck (extended 2 file-system check) also for ext2/3/4\nAn explanation on how to recover an ext superblock manually using these utilities can be found here: Repair a broken Ext4 Superblock in Ubuntu .\nSIDE NOTE: if your partition table is intact (not the case for me), then you could perhaps make use of dumpe2fs like so:\nLinux: Find Alternative Superblocks - nixCraft\nif you are unable to use these utilities to find the backup superblocks (perhaps you messed up multiple partitions, and because of this, you don't know where they start/end) you may find use of a program called gpart (not to be confused with gparted or parted... it's totally different) though I'm not sure if it supports linux file-systems newer than ext2.. If you are at this point, It may be time to start worrying.\n\nUsing this last approach, I was successfully able to recover the entire partition, save the top-level directory names (so I had to rename about 6 top-level folders, but everything below them was preserved)\nSUCCESS!\nAnother thing that ended up being EXTREMELY important for me was creating a backup image of the messed up disk (in my attempts to recover, I ended up restoring this image at least twice)\nso FIRST thing before using any of these utilities, find some free space on your machine or an external drive..\nIf your messed up drive is sda, and you wanted to store the image in yourname's home directory for instance:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/home/yourname/sda.img.bak bs=512\nto restore the image after a failed recovery attempt:\ndd if=/home/yourname/sda.img.bak of=/dev/sda bs=512\nYou could of course use /dev/sda1 if you are only interested in the first partition, but as some of these utilities alter the partition table, it is perhaps a better idea to image the whole disk..\nAlso, if you are using dd for a large operation, it is very helpful to see a progress bar, for which you can use a utility called pv which reports progress of data through a pipeline\nfor instance:\npv -tpreb /dev/sda | dd of=/home/yourname/sda.img.bak bs=512\nBTW: some people suggested making the backup image, and working on it directly, but I found it easier to work on the disk itself (easier to mount) and restoring the image to disk if/when necessary\n\nA: Here a link to a related question we had some time ago: Recovering Very Important Lost Data From Ntfs Partition\nIf the data is REALLY important. Stop using the disk/partition NOW. Unmount it! And do a read only copy of the disk. Every time you try to recover something on the original disk you are in danger of loosing more data. Then try recovery tools on the copied disk image. You can create an image with dd if=your_partition of=your_disk_image_file bs=512 (hope the syntax is correct)\nHave a look here as well DataRecovery - Community Help Wiki and here https://forensicswiki.org/wiki/Tools:Data_Recovery.\nTo make sure you do not loose data work only on the disk image you created!!!!\nIf you cant recover the partition you can still try to use a carving tool like foremost to recover (some) of your data. The tool will analyze the disk content and look for files in well known formats. Have a look here for a quick example how to use it http://www.rissmann.ch/2014/08/09/how-to-recover-lost-files/\n", "Q: Android connected via USB gives inconsistent ID I have an LG Android phone.

It is roughly a virtual network interface that connects a computer to itself.\nThe test consists of sending zero bytes through the layers of the TCP/IP implementation, down to the simulated hardware device loopback, and back up the stack again.\nThe test tells you how fast the network stack implementation is, which depends mainly on how often the network data needs to be copied on the way. Only the throughput is tested, the latency is ignored.\nThe result should not be of much practical relevance as long as the machine is fast enough to handle the traffic. Maybe it's relevant with a 10GB network connection, or multiple 1GB connections.\nOn a single processor machine, I suspect that the main influence to the performance would be the process scheduling of the reader and writer - it would more like test the scheduling algorithm. But assuming both nc instances can use a separate CPU core, that should not be a problem.\nIt could be considered a network test in the sense that the network stack implementation in the kernel is an important part of the network.\n", "Q: How can I enable hibernation for a HP EliteDesk 800 G1 TWR machine?

Deleting the network and re-connecting doesn't work. The only solution I've found is to reboot.\nOne update to this (still not got anything to work, but thanks for the pointers): When it is in the failing state, if I turn off the wireless router, that network continues to appear in the list of available networks, and the computer will try and connect to it! If I delete it from the list of networks then it does disappear. When I turn the router back on then it reappears but I can't connect to it.

But I do not get it to work properly.\nThe first time all is well, but apparently there is a problem with special characters between the mac and ubuntu machine, since every time I run the rsync operation after that, the files with special characters are first deleted and then re-synced. It seems as if there is a problem with different character sets.\nThe preferred solution seems to be to use the --iconv option:\n\nYou can use rsync's --iconv option to convert between UTF-8 NFC & NFD,\n  at least if you're on a Mac. There is a special utf-8-mac character\n  set that stands for UTF-8 NFD. So to copy files from your Mac to your\n  NAS, you'd need to run something like:\nrsync -a --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 localdir/ mynas:remotedir/\nThis will convert all the local filenames from UTF-8 NFD to UTF-8 NFC on the\n  remote server. The files' contents won't be affected.\n\nThat sounds all and well, but my mac does not seem to recognise that option, since I get: \n>     MyMachine:~ Macuser$ /usr/bin/rsync -av --delete --iconv=utf-8,utf-8-mac user@linuxmachine:/home/linuxuser/Test/ /Users/Macuser/Test/\n>     rsync: --iconv=utf-8,utf-8-mac: unknown option\n>     rsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-42/rsync/main.c(1333) [client=2.6.9]\n\nAny suggestions on how this problem should be solved?\nNote, as is perhaps a little hidden in the 'code sample' above, the rsync version on my mac is 2.6.9.\nEDIT: Although Jan solved this problem (see my ticked answer), I am still not quite there, since I now receive a new error:\niconv_open(\"UTF-8\", \"utf-8-mac\") failed\nrsync error: requested action not supported (code 4) at rsync.c(118) [sender=3.0.9]\nrsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [Receiver]\nrsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(226) [Receiver=3.1.1]\n\nI will make a separate query for this further question, however.\n\nA: OS X 10.5 has rsync 2.6.9 but the iconv option is only available in rsync 3.x....\nTo update rsync on your mac you could use macports (installation instructions).\nA Macport (and Homebrew) tutorial is available here.\n", "Q: Support for Asus Z97-pro? I'm in the process of configuring a machine which will be used to run Ubuntu, with Windows through virtualization. Does anyone have experience with this motherboard, and is able to tell me whether this is going to work, including the integrated wifi? Is it doable, or should I better try another board?\n\nA: I decided to build a system.  After a lot of research I bought the list of hardware below.  In trying to decide which motherboard to select, I sent emails to ASUS and Gigabyte, both of whom took a long time to reply.  Their replies were nothing more than a Google search with a hit listing Ubuntu and one of their mother boards in the article, both of which I had already run across.  I decide to go with ASUS.  I am not a gamer and am not interested in over-clocking, so I kept my hardware selection simple.  I could have spent much less or a lot more on the hardware, but I simply wanted to build a dependable machine.  I got most of my stuff from NewEgg.com, but I did buy some from Micro Center, who had some impressive sales prices the day I went in.\nASUS Z97 Pro motherboard with LGA 1150 socket – was easy to install, nice UEFI BIOS screens. \nIntel Core i7 4790 Chip – not the ‘K’ version, as I am not interested in over-clocking for my testing. \nSeasonic G650 80 Plus Gold Power Supply – runs cool and is very quiet. \nCorsair Vengeance Memory , 16Gb – 2 x 8Gb DDR3. Mother Board defaulted it to 1333Mhz, had to change the BIOS to 1600Mhz. \nSamsung 850 EVO SSD – real fast. \nWestern Digital 1Tb, 7200RPM HDD. \nTP-Link PCIe wireless card – model TL-WDN3800 – worked right out of the box, no tweaks necessary.  I went with this add-on card because I read several reviews of the integrated wireless being unreliable. \nCorsiar SPEC-02 Mid Tower – comes with 2 fans and front USB3 ports. \nNo Video card – as mentioned I’m not a gamer, so I just used the Intel video. There is room for a big video card if desired, but you probably would want a bigger power supply to drive it. \nDownloaded Linux from Distrowatch.com – see the right side of the page and choose a flavor.  I went with Ubuntu 14.10. \nBorrowed the Keyboard, mouse, speakers and DVD from another system I had.\nThe hardware installation went very well and pretty easy.  Watch a couple YouTube videos (NewEgg TV had some good ones) on how to install the hardware and read the directions to do it correctly.  Everything worked together from the start.  I have not had to go hunting for drivers.  The UEFI BIOS took some effort to figure out.  At this time, Ubuntu has been running fine for several weeks.  I used KVM to build a virtual machine that is running Windows7 (simultaneously, not a dual boot), also running fine.  Both boot up in about 10 seconds.   \nHope this was helpful.  Best of luck to you.\n\nA: When searching Z97 Topic: From what I have gathered from others posts and answers. (And referenced Bugs links in those posts.) There is a kernel fix being implemented in 14.10 (But not retroactively in 14.04.1 LTS ? ..Well, I hope the kernel fix is implemented there also, so that users don't have to sacrifice LTS just to have it.)\nIn the meantime. I think the Bug workarounds might be best summed up in this:\nHow to fix Ubuntu hardware compatibility issues on an Intel Z97 chipset computer build\nhttps://github.com/Nerdylicious/How_To_Fix_Ubuntu_Compatibility_On_Intel_Z97_Build\nAs to virtualizing Windows: There is an odd UEFI behaviour in Win7 that prevents this, but which seems to not occur with Win8.1\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/7702\n", "Q: How do I develop software for Ubuntu that one could still use in future versions Like many of you, I am sometimes annoyed by the fact that some developers just stop working on software they created (see examples below). As we try to cope with the loss, we sometimes will not accept the fact. Me for instance, started using gradiator, via VirtualBox with Ubuntu 12.04. \nBut eventually we all must come to terms with the facts: some apps are no more. \nSo this question - on behalf of future users and developers - will benefit both party's.  \n\nHow do I develop software for Ubuntu that one could still use in future versions.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nitrogen\n\n*Gradiator\n\n*Cuttlefish\n\nA: In my experience (near 30 years now), hardware and low level code (BIOS for instance) change not that much or more accurately, keep a very good ascending compatibility. (I wrote twenty five years ago a little game program in assembler, running with DOS and VGA display: it's still running fine on modern Windows computers).\nSo I would say: avoid dependencies as much as possible. When planning to use a library or an API, examine thoroughly its history and evolution, and how it still run \"obsolete\" code or not. If you're in doubt, try to incorporate to your project the source code (and not the compiled library). If the functionalities it provides is not strictly computer oriented (like maths libs or general algorithms), you probably need not upgrades.\nJust my two cents...\n\nA: Make it Open Source! That way anyone can jump in and maintain, fix, whatever, when for whatever reason you just can't anymore, although this can happen due to basic operability (stares at air apps...) some apps just need an extra hit with a hammer to keep them working.\nGraditor: Packaged for 14.04 with little difficulty: \nPPA named gradiator-mateo for Mateo Salta : Mateo Salta\nCuttlefish: someone already went through the trouble of making a ppa for it: \nInstall Cuttlefish in Ubuntu 14.04 or Ubuntu 13.10 | UbuntuHandbook\nNitrogen - is in the repository still, may just need some bug love.

I have noticed openrc package after I have upgraded to 14.10. \nSo, is it possible to get rid of upstart and systemd(logind, udevd) and upstart and move to it?\nI have installed the package and have rc-* commands, but /sbin/init is still upstart and systemd components are still there. I have tried to set init=/sbin/openrc but pc then failed to boot, printing something about deadlock resolving.\n\nA: It seem that the question holds the answer itself. As @muru pointed, openrc does not replace /sbin/init, but works in pair with the init system already running. \nSo the correct answer for ubuntu 14.10 and higher, is just sudo apt-get install openrc, reboot and see your system running a zoo of multiple init systems.\nPS: After installation, boot time increased in about two times, and after removal, it just have removed half of the packages as well. \n", "Q: External HDD not mounted error for backup with LuckyBackup I've come across LuckyBackup to make regular backups on a external drive.

And for UEFI I mean the UEFI partition of your hard disk. It's not important where the file to boot is storage, is enough that UEFI know that it's trusted an where is it. So you don't need an UEFI partition in your USB, is enough that there is a correct configuration on the UEFI in your machine. I think that you have to do is: delete UEFI partition on your pen drive (simple you don't need it, is enough the uefi partition of hdd), use bootrepair to install grub64.EFI in your pen drive, then enter in UEFI and flag that one as trusted for execution (more or less like it: Allowing boot of Ubuntu on a Acer Aspire v5-531 with UEFI ).cheer\nTranslate: è sufficiente una singola partizione UEFI, e questa deve stare sull'hard disk del tuo pc. Se grub non si trova sulla chiavetta (su cui hai installato il sistema operativo, non una live, vero?) devi usare il programma bootrepair per installare grub in quella partizione (sdb o qualcosa del genere). Fatto ciò occorre insegnare a UEFI dove trovare il file di boot di grub, più o meno come fatto qui: Allowing boot of Ubuntu on a Acer Aspire v5-531 with UEFI ) NB grub e UEFI sono due cose completamente diverse! UEFI in pratica sostituisce il bios e definisce il file da bootare, grub è il file che UEFI usa per il boot: quindi quando leggi grub.efi si intende un banalissimo file leggibile dal (semplificando un poco) progamma di boot che GIÀ si trova nella partizione UEFI.

Is Ubuntu an open source software (OSS)?\n\nA: This is not a simple question at all. \nAs well as Debian’s one, official repository of Ubuntu includes free (mostly) and some non-free software in different sections, but their names are not so clear: main and universe consist of free packages, restricted and multiverse –  of non-free. Some of packages in the latter two could be really necessary to use you PC (like some firmwares and some drivers), but the rest are not.\nMoreover, Ubuntu makes installing non-free software easy enough to be installed accidentely without realizing what did you install.\nIf you are concerned about non-free software on your PC, you might use aptitude to find out whether anything non-free is installed:\n$ aptitude search '?installed (?section(restricted) | ?section(multiverse))'\n\nor install a small utility vrms, and ask it:\n$ vrms\n\nIf you are conserned a lot about using only free software, you might consider installing a Trisquel GNU/Linux, which is basically completely free Ubuntu.\nAs for the term ‘open source’, if you just use it as a synonym to ‘free / libre’, see all the above. But if you cares about Open Source Initiative opinion and want to follow it strictly (there are actually few who do it, but if), then even the main and universe sections of repository includes some software, which is not ‘open source’ according to OSI: OpenSSL is a most notable example. Yes, OpenSSL cannot be technically called ‘open source’ according to OSI (despite the http://openssl.org states the opposite), since its license is basically conjunction of license of SSLeay and 4-clause BSD License, so it inherited obnoxious BSD advertising clause, which is not OSI-approved.\n\nA: Yes it is!\n\nUbuntu software is free. Always was, always will be. Free software gives everyone the freedom to use it however they want and share with whoever they like.\n\nRefer the Ubuntu philosophy for detailed information.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS suddenly slowed down I have been using 14.04 LTS for a couple of months and it run perfectly.

But I do not get it to work properly, since every time I re-run the rsync operation after the initial time, the files with special characters are first deleted and then re-synced. It seems as if there is a problem with different character sets.\nThe preferred solution seems to be to use the --iconv option:\n\nYou can use rsync's --iconv option to convert between UTF-8 NFC & NFD,\n  at least if you're on a Mac. There is a special utf-8-mac character\n  set that stands for UTF-8 NFD. So to copy files from your Mac to your\n  NAS, you'd need to run something like:\nrsync -a --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 localdir/ mynas:remotedir/\nThis will convert all the local filenames from UTF-8 NFD to UTF-8 NFC on the\n  remote server. The files' contents won't be affected.\n\nThanks to @Jan, I updated my rsync version on my mac from 2.6.9. to 3.1.1. Still, I am still not quite there, since I now receive a further error:\niconv_open(\"UTF-8\", \"utf-8-mac\") failed\nrsync error: requested action not supported (code 4) at rsync.c(118) [sender=3.0.9]\nrsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [Receiver]\nrsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(226) [Receiver=3.1.1]\n\nI am at loss to understand why \"requested action not supported\" since it seems that the rsync version on my Ubuntu (12.04) is post 3.x.x, and thus should support the --iconv option.\nEDIT: Let me add that when I (on the Mac, nota bene) initiate a rsync FROM the Mac TO Linux, everything works splendidly:\nrsync -av --delete --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 localdir/ mynas:remotedir/\n\nBut going the other way' from the mac does not work. Strangely enough, testing to initiate the rsync from the linux machine renders this strange message:\nrsync: on remote machine: --iconv=UTF-8-MAC: unknown option\nrsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-45/rsync/main.c(1333) [server=2.6.9]\nrsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]\nrsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(605) [sender=3.0.9]\n\nincluding the very strange claim [server=2.6.9], although I have updated to 3.1.1 on the Mac. For some reasons, it looks as my linux machine 'sees' only the original rsync version on the Mac.\nAny suggestion on how to solve this?\n\nA: I can confirm this works, I was having the same problem. In my case any file with an accented character was unreadable on the destination. I only spotted it by running a folder comparison on my Mac using the Compare Folders application:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/compare-folders/id816042486?mt=12\nAdded the above --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 and BOOM! rsync replaced every accented file with a new one.\nTo add some information as it seems the above links no longer work, to upgrade rsync to 3.1.2, install Macports and run:\nsudo port install rsync\nThe reason why you were seeing the remote server returning version 2.6.9 is because the old version is actually still there and the remote server is seeing that one instead of the new one.\nVersion 2.6.9 is located in /usr/bin\n\nA: The solution was embarrassingly simple: Much due to a comment I read when researching the problem, I thought you were supposed to specify the character set in the order of transformation; but it seems as that is not the correct syntax. Rather, one should always use --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 when initialising the rsync from the mac, and always use --iconv=utf-8,utf-8-mac when initialising the rsync from the linux machine, no matter if I want to sync files from the mac or linux machine.\nThen it works like magic!\nEDIT: Indeed, sometimes, checking the manual page closely is a good thing to do. Here it is, black on white:\n--iconv=CONVERT_SPEC\n              Rsync  can  convert  filenames between character sets using this\n              option.  Using a CONVERT_SPEC of \".\" tells rsync to look up  the\n              default  character-set via the locale setting.  Alternately, you\n              can fully specify what conversion to do by giving a local and  a\n              remote   charset   separated   by   a   comma   in   the   order\n              --iconv=LOCAL,REMOTE, e.g.  --iconv=utf8,iso88591.   This  order\n              ensures  that the option will stay the same whether you're push-\n              ing  or  pulling  files.\n\n", "Q: Nexus 7 2012 with newer desktop Ubuntu I read many about that and because I dont know what do with N7 I'd like install some linux on that. :-)\nIn last days and nights I trying that and I succesfull installed Ubuntu Touch Preview and Ubuntu 13.04, but I'd like install newer version which have support and active repositories or maybe older 12.04 which still have support.\nIs there any change how I can do it? I found some tutorials how (maybe) install newer version, but only over Ubuntu desktop on PC and I must do it over Windows laptop. Or if someone have experience with other distro or some other OS.\nThanks for help and tips.\n\nA: I have also a Nexus 7 (2012), I followed the instructions at :\nhttps://developer.ubuntu.com/en/start/ubuntu-for-devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices/\nbut to be able to flash the nexus with Ubuntu, I replaced the step involving ubuntu-device-flash by this command :\nsudo ubuntu-device-flash touch --channel=\"ubuntu-touch/trusty\" --device=grouper --bootstrap\nI also tried a lot of things before this, one of them was in the recovery mode: I wiped the cache.\nbut, I'm not perfecty sure all that is good, as, even though I succesfully installed Ubuntu on the Nexus, I'm stuck at the unlock page : It doesn't accept the swipe from the right edge.\ngood luck !\n", "Q: Require sudo to delete files, but still allow writing I've got all my files on a server raid, and it has a reasonably excessive amount of space so I'm not often going to have to delete anything. \nI still have things writing to the raid all the time so I don't want to have to use sudo to do that. But is it possible to set permissions so that writing is allowed but deleting files is not?\nI assume this will also require me to use sudo for mv commands, but that isn't a problem\nExtra info:\nRaid uses btrfs raid1\nOS is on a separate drive (Ubuntu 14.04 server)\n\nA: You need directory write permissions to create or delete files.\nYou need file write permissions to change the file.\nConsidering this tree:\nFolderA: (no write permissions for you)\n   - FileX (write permissions)\n   - FileY (write permissions)\n\nYou can now change FileX and FileY but you can't delete them. Nor can you create a FileZ in FolderA.\n\nA: I don't think it's possible. File creation and deletion in Unix are controlled by the ability to write to the directory --- basically the same flag. \nNow what you can do is create two directories --- one with write permission and the other one restricted to root. \n[romano:~/tmp/test] % ls -l\ntotal 8\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 romano romano 4096 Oct  8 18:06 normal\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 root   root   4096 Oct  8 18:06 onlyroot\n\nYou normally work on normal. Suppose you have in it: \n[romano:~/tmp/test/normal] % ls\none.txt  three.txt  two.txt\n\nYou can clearly delete files and create new ones; suppose you want to protect \"one.txt\" from deleting. What you can do is creating a hard link to it in onlyroot: \n[romano:~/tmp/test/normal] 1 % sudo ln one.txt ../onlyroot\n\nThis will create another name for one.txt in onlyroot (using a negligible amount of space; the file is not copied). Now as a normal user you can delete one.txt in the normal folder, but you will have an untouchable version under the onlyroot one. \n[romano:~/tmp/test/normal] % ls\none.txt  three.txt  two.txt\n[romano:~/tmp/test/normal] % rm one.txt\nrm: remove regular empty file ‘one.txt’? y\n[romano:~/tmp/test/normal] % cd ..\n[romano:~/tmp/test] % cd onlyroot \n[romano:~/tmp/test/onlyroot] % ls\none.txt\n[romano:~/tmp/test/onlyroot] % rm one.txt \nrm: remove regular empty file ‘one.txt’? y\nrm: cannot remove ‘one.txt’: Permission denied\n\n\nA: In my understanding (based on https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Project_ideas#RichACLs_.2F_NFS4_ACLS), btrfs supports only traditional Unix permissions and POSIX.1e ACLs, and hence can't do what you want.\nMany/most other filesystems support at least one of Linux richacls (which I don't believe is in mainline yet), NFSv4 ACLs, ZFS ACLs, or Windows ACLs, all of which allow you to specifically deny 'delete', but I don't imagine you'd be willing to give up the features of btrfs just for this.\nOn the other hand, since you are specifically intending this to guard against simple errors, you might be better off taking advantage of btrfs's snapshot capabilities using something like autosnap.\n\nA: I think one solution would be to just create a function in your bashrc, e.g.:\nsudowrapper () { \nsudo -k;sudo \"$@\";sudo -K; \n}\n\nvimf() {\n    echo \"pass\" | sudowrapper -S nvim \"$1\"\n}\n\nsudowrapper is required to make sudo forget the credentials every time vimf is called, otherwise it gives weird behavior.\nDo this only if you want to save you from doing something wrong yourself if your goal is to prevent others from doing something bad then writing your password in .bashrc is a bad idea.\n", "Q: gcc compile error I built a cross compiler on Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit for MIPS platform before. but now I can't compile ordinary C programs with GCC. i removed and reinstalled everything but every time i get this error. \nas: \nunrecognized option '--32' \n\nWith gcc --version I get this:\n GNU assembler 2.13.2 Copyright 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

I have had the persistent problem for about a year now where whenever I log out I lose all of my enabled extensions apart from Media Player. Previously I managed to get around this by enabling each of the extensions at start up using \"gnome-session-manager\", but this has now disappeared from Gnome 3.14 since it has been replaced by right click options on the dash. I also tried defaulting my boot session to \"default session\" which has worked for some people as a solution.\nThere now seems to be no work around for this very annoying and persistent problem with Gnome. It has been a lurking issue for at least a year now with many users effected and nothing but the load at boot workaround on offer. How such a chronic bug can be allowed to sit for over a year is frankly beyond me.\nHas anyone got any fresh ideas for a more permanent solution to this Gnome bug ?\nStephen \n\nA: Here's a workaround in the spirit of this answer. This works at least for 3.12. The idea is to export a list of the extensions you want active, then write a script that activate them at boot.\nGetting extension list\nFirst, activate the extensions you want active. We then generate a list with those:\nIn terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T), run\ngsettings get org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions\n\nIt returns a list with your currently active extensions a la\n['Bottom_Panel@rmy.pobox.com', 'impatience@gfxmonk.net']\n\nSetting extensions\nTo activate exactly the extensions in the list, run\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions ['extension_1',  'extension_2', 'extension_3']\n\nbut with your own list, naturally :)\nScript to set extensions on boot\nTo automate on boot, create a script running that command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to e.g. your home folder, and create a new empty file. Name it script_name.sh (only the extension matters). Start the file name with a full stop . if you want it to be hidden.\n\n*In that file, write\n#!/bin/bash\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions ['extension_1',  'extension_2', 'extension_3']\n\nThen save the file, of course :)\n\n\n*Make the file executable e.g. by right click > Properties > Permissions > Check \"Allow executing file as program\"\nAlternatively, change the permissions from terminal by running chmod ugo+x script_name.sh in the script's folder.\n\n*Make it on system start up (I don't know how else to do this): in ~/.config/autostart/ create a file called some_name2.desktop and in it put\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=your_prefered_name_here\nExec=/home/your_user_name/.script_name.sh\n# Terminal=false\nType=Application\nHidden=false\nStartupNotify=false\nName[en_US]=your_prefered_name_here\n\nThe path after Exec= should be to where the script you created in step 2 is. Again, save the file :)\nMaybe immediately or else after boot, you should see the script in Gnome Tweak Tool under Startup Applications. It should also run on startup.\nActivating and Deactivating Extensions\nIf you want to change which extensions are run, you should re-generate the list, then insert the new list in the script run.\nFinal Words\nI hope this works in 3.14, too.\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run in terminal: rm -rd ~/.cache\n\n*Reboot system\n\n*Re-enable your extensions (it should persist across reboots now)\n\n\nA: I had the exact same problem, running Ubuntu 14.10 with GNOME 3.14 from the GNOME 3 PPAs. So I tried this solution, but the real challenge for me was to find the setting to select System Default instead of GNOME on Ubuntu GNOME's login screen\n\nMoreover due to Topicons extension, other extensions are still not activated on login.\n\nA: This problem doesn't apply to new user accounts which suggests its a problem caused by retained Gnome settings files from upgraded previous versions of Gnome Shell.\nI will investigate resetting the account settings.\n\nTried resetting all the Gnome User account details for my main user. This didn't work so its not account specific.\n\nA: For me, all Gnome extensions where globally disabled (maybe by some shortcut?).\nThey can easily be re-enabled on the Gnome Extensions page.\n\n", "Q: Custom Keyboard Layout to use H J K L as ARROWS not working properly I set up my keyboard layout in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ to use the keys H, J, K, L as arrows Left, Down, Up and Right as the third and fourth shift level. mostly I followed this post.\nThe R.

I've read that I need to boot into a LiveCD, usually I'd use my memory stick for this, but I need to use it to install Windows with. Unfortunately I don't have a second memory stick big enough to have the Windows installer on it. Can I still install Windows alongside Ubuntu without the need for an Ubuntu LiveCD? Can someone guide me through this so I don't mess anything up?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The easiest way to do what you want given your resources of two hard drives and one USB stick, where one hard drive has Ubuntu already installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase the USB stick and prepare it as an Windows installation USB.\n\n*Turn off the computer and unplug it.\n\n*Open the computer and disconnect the Ubuntu hard drive.\n\n*Put the new hard drive in its bay and connect all the wires.\n\n*Install Windows as if you have just one hard drive, the second one.\n\n*Turn off the computer and unplug it again.\n\n*Reconnect the Ubuntu hard drive. Keep the Windows hard drive connected as well.\n\n*Start the computer and get into its BIOS.\n\n*Make sure the Ubuntu hard drive is the first in the list of drive to\nboot from, save BIOS settings and reboot the computer.\n\n*The computer will boot directly to Ubuntu. This is normal.\n\n*In Ubuntu open a terminal by pressing\n Ctrl+Alt+T and enter:\nsudo update-grub\nThis will add the option to choose between Ubuntu and Windows in the GRUB screen. The GRUB screen will show every time you start/ restart the computer.\nHope this helps\n\nA: You have multiple options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows first using the bigger stick, then use something like (or) Unetbootin, to create an Ubuntu disk on the same stick (Ubuntu will fit on any stick that can manage windows :P). Ubuntu will auto detect windows. I'll recommend this.\n\n*Install Ubuntu first, use winusb to create a windows disk, and update grub. Be sure to have os-prober.\n\n*If you prefer an adventure, you can try this for VMware or this for VirtualBox. This method is advanced and somewhat overkill. You have been warned. You can use this method to install both operating systems with an Ubuntu sized stick.\n\n\nA: You can also install it as a virtual machine.\nTo do so download and install virtual box from here \nThen follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the site of Microsoft.\n\n*In virtual machine select MSEdge on win 10 stable.\n\n*Select platform as Virtual Box.\n\n*Clik on the DOWNLOAD .Zip\n\n*After successful download go to the folder in which it has been downloaded  and copy it to your virtual box directory(VirtualBoxVMS)  in your Home  directory.\n\n*Open your virtual box(Go to show applications and search virtual box and hit  enter).\n\n*Double click(hit enter after selecting the file) on the .zip file. It will                   open an  .ova file.\n\n*Double click on the .ova file and go to your virtual box. A window will come asking to import.\n\n*Click on import.\n\n*On the part of your Virtual box select(click on) MSEdge windows 10 and then go to settings.\n\n*In settings go to System and change the base memory to 1GB but if you have 16GB of ram then make it to 2GB and  select ok.\n\n*Click on start button.\n\n*It will ask you for password. The password is (Passw0rd!)\n\n*To activate your windows machine go to command prompt, run it in administrative mode(click right on command promt while selecting command prompt and select run as administrator).\n\n*Run command slmgr/ato.\nNow you have successfully installed your windows 10 virtual machine go ahead and enjoy it.\n", "Q: UnECM isn't working, returning \"command not found\" I'm trying to get the unecm command of ecm tools to work, and I installed it through apt-get.

In this case, with dpkg -L ecm it shows:\n/.\n/usr\n/usr/bin\n/usr/bin/ecm-compress\n/usr/share\n/usr/share/doc\n/usr/share/doc/ecm\n/usr/share/doc/ecm/changelog.Debian.gz\n/usr/share/doc/ecm/copyright\n/usr/share/man\n/usr/share/man/fr\n/usr/share/man/fr/man1\n/usr/share/man/fr/man1/ecm-uncompress.1.gz\n/usr/share/man/fr/man1/ecm-compress.1.gz\n/usr/share/man/man1\n/usr/share/man/man1/ecm-uncompress.1.gz\n/usr/share/man/man1/ecm-compress.1.gz\n/usr/bin/ecm-uncompress\n\nChiefly of note there are the ones in the /usr/bin directory:\n/usr/bin\n/usr/bin/ecm-compress\n/usr/bin/ecm-uncompress\n\nThese are the only 'commands' that were installed by the package (aside from man ecm-uncompress ecm-compress\n\nA: You can install ecm using the command apt-get install ecm. Use another command to unecm the file:ecm-uncompress file-name.bin.ecm. It's easier if you just type ecm-uncompress then drag the file.bin.ecm into the terminal. It worked for me.\n", "Q: VNC and Lubuntu I'm trying to install a VNC server on a Lubuntu 14.04 install, but nothing works.\nI have tried the official documentation, as well as some other pages. I googled around and read some Stack Exchange's QA, nothing works.\nUsing Remmina, it will quickly fail unless I configure an SSH tunnel... after which it will just hang there and I have to xkill it.\nUsing xtightvncviewer on a remote PC, I simply get a connection refused. After following the official documentation :\nTerminal 1\n$ ssh -L 12345:localhost:5900 user@192.168.1.120\nWelcome to Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-36-generic x86_64)\n\n * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/\n\nLast login: Wed Oct  8 13:53:09 2014 from ibm-dev1\nuser@VTX-Server:~$ channel 3: open failed: connect failed: Connection refused\n\nTerminal 2\n$ xvncviewer localhost:12345\nxvncviewer: VNC server closed connection\n[1]+  Exit 1                  xvncviewer localhost:12345\n\nDid this happen to anyone? How can it be fixed?\n\nA: I don't use VNC, but I've been using TeamViewer for quite a while and I'm very satisfied with it.\nTeamViewer is multiplatform (it can be installed on Linux, Windows and OS X) and it is client and server at the same time, I mean, in one single application: just install it on the machines you want and use it.\nIt works with a static ID + dynamic password scheme: each machine receives an ID and password. So, when you run TeamViewer, it will show you the static ID of your computer and its current password. If you want someone to access your computer, tell this person to run TeamViewer on his/her computer, then inform this person what's your ID and your current password. This person will then type your ID into his/her TeamViewer instance, hit \"connect to partner\", then type your password and hit OK. That's it.\nIf you download the TeamViewer .deb installation file, you can install it with dpkg by running this shell command:\nsudo dpkg -i <path_to_package>\n\n...where <path_to_package> is the full path to the downloaded TeamViewer DEB package. For instance, let's assume that your home folder is /home/username (a shortcut to it is the character ~), that your downloads folder is /home/username/Downloads (shortcut: ~/Downloads) and that you downloaded a file named teamviewer_i386.deb and saved it into your downloads folder. In such case, the downloaded package will be in ~/Downloads/teamviewer_i386.deb, thus the installation command will be:\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/teamviewer_i386.deb\n\nOnce the execution of the above command is finished, TeamViewer will be installed and ready to use.\nAlthough the current version (11.0.57095) of the TeamViewer DEB package doesn't have any dependencies, it's not impossible that further versions have one or more dependencies - and in such scenario dpkg won't be able to install the DEB package, because dpkg doesn't solve dependencies. Thus, I recommend using Gdebi instead of dpkg: Gdebi has a GUI (graphical user interface) and it automatically solves DEB package dependencies.\nIf you don't have Gdebi, I recommend installing it by running this shell command:\nsudo apt-get install gdebi -y\n\nIf you installed Gdebi and now want to use it to install the TeamViewer DEB package (or any other DEB package), start Gdebi, select the File menu, hit Open..., select the DEB package, click Open and then hit the Install Package button. That's it: Gdebi will analyze this local .deb file for dependencies, automatically download the dependencies and install them.\n", "Q: One time \"firmware\" upgrade script I was wondering how you could make a script so that on first boot it changes files to a specific parameters?  So it would be like if I just installed a fresh kernel.  I want to run a script once and that script will change /etc/network/interfaces to have preset static IPs and to add a message of the day message.  Other items such as creating new users could be added to this script to automate the process a little.\nIs it possible to have this script be installed with the kernel so it runs on first boot and then all settings get set?  \n\nA: \"@fkraiem Most likely not. I am installing a version of ubuntu and would like to make changes automatically versus doing the same process several times for different boards\"\nYou could write a Bash script that, when run, makes the changes you want. Then you can put it on a USB stick and run it with every new install.\n(this is all in a terminal, I use gnome-terminal)\nFor instance, you could have a template interfaces file that is what you want all of them to look like, and then you could write a script file like so: gedit scriptfile\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo cp ./interfaces /etc/network/interfaces\nsudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces\n\nThen you could run chmod +x scriptfile to make it executable.\nThen you put the scriptfile and the interfaces template file onto a flash drive and when you install Ubuntu on a new \"board\" you can open the flash drive and run the scriptfile and it will replace the current /etc/network/interfaces file with the template one and then open it in Gedit for you to customise the IP address.\n", "Q: Grub Setup for dual Ubuntu under EFI I have installed to versions of Ubuntu, one up-to-date Xubuntu and a 12.04.5LTS Ubuntu. I first installed Xubuntu and later Ubuntu. Since the 12.04 would not write a correct grub-conf on install (I set up encryption for Xubuntu following this guide) i decided to let the grub conf on the efi partition load the grub conf from Xubuntus /boot partition. While I can now boot both OS's I get some errors about grub not being allowed to load some modules (error: Secure Boot forbids loading module from (XX,YY)).\nI assume that this has something to do with efi and beeing signed. What is the easiest way to fix this? Can I simply reinstall grub from the Xubuntu?\n\nA: I found https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/SecureBoot.\nReinstalling grub with the --uefi-secure-boot option fixed the problem for me.\nsudo grub-install --uefi-secure-boot\n\n\nA: Most BIOSs allow you to turn off \"secure boot\" which should solve any of your problems related to unsigned modules.\nFYI: My BIOS required me to set a BIOS password before it allowed me to change the \"secure boot\" setting, so I set it to something useless as a password, but easy to remember.\n", "Q: Import radio stations in Rhythmbox I know Rhythmbox stores all kind of information in ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml.\nAll entries with type=\"iradio\" are radio stations.\nI would like to import radio stations from TuneIn.\nMy question is: is there any API I can use to manipulate this xml database?\nI mean, I can do it by hand, but since Rhythmbox already manipulates it, and it has plugin support, I guess there is some better way to update it then doing it outside of the app.\nUPDATE\nI ended up updating it by hand https://github.com/umpirsky/rhytmbox-tunein-import.\n\nA: Rhythmbox does have a C / Python API which you can use to add and change details of tracks / songs/ radio stations / podcasts etc.\nYou don't write directly to the local rhythmdb.xml - this is an internal XML format subject to change between versions.\nIn the following sample the key parts are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"iradio\" is the entry_type that corresponds to internet radio stations stored in the internal database\n\n*you create new entries via RB.RhythmDBEntry.new\n\n*you must commit the entry to the database before modifying additional details such as the radio station title and the station genre\n\n\n\nfrom gi.repository import GObject, Peas\nfrom gi.repository import RB\n\nclass SamplePython(GObject.Object, Peas.Activatable):\n    __gtype_name = 'SamplePythonPlugin'\n    object = GObject.property(type=GObject.GObject)\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        GObject.Object.__init__(self)\n\n    def do_activate(self):\n        print(\"activating sample python plugin\")\n\n        shell = self.object\n        db = shell.props.db\n\n        entry_type = db.entry_type_get_by_name(\"iradio\")\n\n        url = \"http://bbc.co.uk/radio/listen/live/r1.asx\"\n        entry = RB.RhythmDBEntry.new(db, entry_type, url)\n        db.commit()\n        db.entry_set(entry, RB.RhythmDBPropType.TITLE, url)\n        db.entry_set(entry, RB.RhythmDBPropType.GENRE, \"Unknown\")\n\n    def do_deactivate(self):\n        print(\"deactivating sample python plugin\")\n\n\n", "Q: User cant access samba from windows 8.1 [Open_Share]\npath = /home/brady/open_share\navailable = yes\nguest ok = yes\nvalid users = brady\nread only = no\nbrowseable = yes\npublic = yes\nwritable = yes\nforce user = brady\ncreate mask = 0640\ndirectory mask = 0750\n\nI also have security = user in the [Global] section\nMy problem is when I try to access Open_share on a windows 8.1 laptop it asks for a password then keeps popping up with the password window. After a couple of tries Windows says \"Open_share cannot be accessed\". It says it can not find it. I set my brady user's password to test from samba. I can not tell if the password is wrong or if it can not find Open_share. \nThis is for a home server environment. So I am not strict on security. I just want to be able to access Open_Share. I even deleted valid users = brady and it still will not let me access it. \nI have tried everything. Maybe there is something wrong with the path?\n\nA: I see you have practically tried everything. I recommend starting with a fresh copy of the smb.conf file. It should look something like this:\n[global]\n    workgroup = XTREME\n    server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)\n    dns proxy = no\n    force user = cyrex\n    log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m\n    max log size = 1000\n    syslog = 0\n    panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d\n    encrypt passwords = true\n    obey pam restrictions = yes\n    unix password sync = yes\n    passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u\n    passwd chat = *Enter\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *Retype\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *password\\supdated\\ssuccessfully* .\n    pam password change = yes\n    map to guest = bad user\n    usershare allow guests = yes\n\n[printers]\n    comment = All Printers\n    browseable = no\n    path = /var/spool/samba\n    printable = yes\n    create mask = 0700\n\n[print$]\n    comment = Printer Drivers\n    path = /var/lib/samba/printers\n\n[movies]\n    path = /media/cyrex/titan\n    browseable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n\nIn this case I only have the movies share which I made. It works under Windows XP, 7 or 8. I added/modified the following options to the default smb.conf which do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*guest ok = yes - This helps with the password issue.  \n\n*force user = cyrex - This also helps with the password issue and lets users see the content of the shared resource instead of only seeing the shared resource.    \n\n*browseable = yes - Will let users see the shared resource when navigating on the network.  \n\n*workgroup = XTREME - This is the workgroup on my LAN.\n\n\nNotice I do not have any other attributes or permissions to make the example easier and as you mentioned, it is local so not much worry on security. After doing that I only did sudo service smbd restart to let samba read the new setup.\nTo create the original smb.conf do the following:\nsudo cp -a /usr/share/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/\n\nYou can find a bit more information about samba in:\nHow can I connect to a Samba server using its hostname instead of the IP?\nHere's my smb.conf file.

To check, open up a termianl and type uname -p. That will tell you if you have 32-bit (in which you'll get iX86, where X can be anything) or x86_64, 64-bit. You should have 64-bit. If not, it's time to back up and reinstall. Also, you have 12GB of RAM, which is quite a bit. I think that you should set your swappiness to 3. For information on how to do this, read the first answer here. Now, if you do have 32-bit Ubuntu, change the swappiness after you install 64-bit Ubuntu, as it will benefit you greatly. Use a task management tool like GNOME System Monitor (preinstalled with Ubuntu) to check your processor use. Maybe it's your processor that's slow. P.S.

Currently the smaller one in the bay normally reserved for a CD/DVD drive drains first, leaving the main one untouched until the smaller one is totally discharged.\nHow can I change the order in which the batteries drain so that the main battery discharges first?\n\nA: For a couple of years, I serviced the laptops of a larger German car manufacturer. I've seen all kinds of Toshibas, Compaqs, IBMs / Lenovos and HPs. \nOn some (I can't recall the brand though), you could see a read-only BIOS entry, listing the \"battery order\", but it was neither changeable through the BIOS nor the system.\nOn none of all these laptops it was possible to change the battery usage order.\n", "Q: Show ubuntu boot as UEFI in boot selection HP Envy I've recently installed xubuntu on my HP Envy 15. I can't set it as default boot because it is not seen as UEFI boot. The strange fact is that the usb drive I used to install xubuntu (made with unetbootin) is seen as UEFI and it has the highest priority starting before Win8.1. Looking in the boot selection screen I see:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS Boot Manager\n\n*ubuntu\n\n*USB Drive (UEFI) <- That is the one made with unetbootin.\n\n\nIt's possible to set the second one as UEFI too?\n\nA: That drove me crazy for THREE FULL DAYS of 18-20 hours apiece!\nThe solution turned out to be uber simple ... abandon the UEFI concept entirely. That's right, bulldoze that garbage overboard because HP tailored their rendition of it to only respond to Windows. (From reading between the lines on the HP (poor) support site and trying to avoid getting sucked into their \"pay to play\" scheme. $29.99 for a single question? Get real.)\nIn the bios, select \"Secure Drive Defaults\" and toggle every-setting-there. Then arrange the boot order, DISABLING the UEFI and PXE boot options. You aren't booting from a network and their implementation of UEFI doesn't play well with guys named Linux.\nBe ruthless!\nSave the bios and POWER DOWN. Don't just re-boot ... pull the plug on that beastie and give it a minute or two. HP seems to enjoy saving state when you would rather turn them off. From where I sit I can see a little green light that glows for a full minute even after unplugging the power from the transformer.

Then put the following line (not commented!) underneath: \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pcie_aspm=force acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nOnce you are done doing that, close gedit, and run one more command in the terminal: \nsudo update-grub and reboot. If it works, hooray! If not, open up the file, uncomment the two lines, remove the line I told you to put in, close it, run sudo update-grub and reboot to undo what we have done.

I'm not even sure what version I have. I think it's the newest, cuz the guy who installed this for me a about 2 months ago said it was fairly new...\n\nA: lol, same happened to me 4-5 years ago when I first heard about Linux. My head still hurts while reading some guides and stuff like that :D\nWell, first, you have to learn terminology... whats what. Like, for example, root administrator is the absolute owner of that OS (stands for Operating System, like Windows 7, Ubuntu etc.). Therefore, root administrator can do everything on (install, uninstall, delete system files, modify them and so on). Normal users cant. It's like Administrator on Windows. Now, how I learned all that is by simply googling that what I didn't understand or knew. So, just now I typed Linux terminology and this is what came up: Is Linux Confusing?\nAfter you lean all that terminology you will have the foundation for reading some articles on the web about Linux, how it works, whats the difference between Windows and Linux and so on. And how to find those articles? Google is you best friend ;)\nDo you have to become a geek to use Ubuntu? Nope :) You just have to familiarize yourself with it, just like you did with Windows, Androind on your mobile phone, navigation in your car...

If you obtain an rtsp:// URL that doesn't work at all, try replacing the scheme with mms://.\n", "Q: Remove manually installed java application \nI had installed an Java application named Visual_Paradigm.

Note: you must either be connected to Ethernet or have a usb wifi adapter for this to work.\nFirst, click on the top right where all of your wifi networks are listed. Then, near the bottom of that list click \"Edit wifi networks.\" This will open a page with the networks that you have most recently used on the front. Click the add button on the top right, and when it asks you for the connection type, make sure to click \"wifi.\" Then, set the connection name and SSID to whatever you want, provided that the SSID is one word. Also, change the mode from Infrastructure to Ad Hoc. If you want your hotspot to be password protected, then move over to the security tab and select WEP 128-bit passphrase from the dropdown list. Lastly, move over to the IPv4 settings and select \"shared to other computers\" near the bottom of the dropdown list. Click save on the bottom right.\nNext, click on the wifi list again from the top right of your screen. Click on add a new wifi network near the bottom. On the dropdown menu select the name of whatever you named your hotspot. It will autofill all of the information. Then click \"Ok.\" Now, your computer will automatically connect to the hotspot, and it should be visible to those relatively near you. However, it won't actually work yet because your computer isn't actually connected to your router. This is why you need to plug into Ethernet or plug in a separate USB wifi adapter and connect to our home network from there. Then, it should work. Good Luck!\n", "Q: What can be done when my Ubuntu completely hangs and nothing works? My system recently hung up and nothing worked.

I'm a little confused as to how I should go about doing this. Ultimately I want the user to be able to login with their facebook/google/ubuntu one accounts. After reading a bit about OpenID and OAuth I think I should be using one of them for this.\nSo far in my app I'm using the user's Ubuntu One account to authenticate like this:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.1\nimport Ubuntu.Components.ListItems 1.0 as ListItem\nimport Ubuntu.OnlineAccounts 0.1\nimport Ubuntu.OnlineAccounts.Client 0.1\nimport \"../common\"\n\nPage {\n    id: root\n    title: \"Authenticate\"\n\n    AccountService {\n        id: accountService\n        onAuthenticated: {\n            console.log(\"Reply: \" + JSON.stringify(reply))\n        }\n    }\n\n    AccountServiceModel {\n        id: accountsModel\n        provider: \"ubuntuone\"\n    }\n\n    function useFirstAccountToAutheticate() {\n        accountService.objectHandle = accountsModel.get(0, \"accountServiceHandle\")\n        accountService.authenticate({})\n    }\n\n    Button {\n        anchors {\n            left: parent.left\n            right: parent.right\n            bottom: parent.bottom\n        }\n        text: i18n.tr(\"Authenticate using Ubuntu One\")\n\n        onTriggered: {\n            if (accountsModel.count > 0) {\n                useFirstAccountToAutheticate()\n            }\n            else {\n                setup.exec()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    Setup {\n        id: setup\n        providerId: \"ubuntuone\"\n\n        onFinished: {\n            useFirstAccountToAutheticate()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nUpon successful authentication I get:\nReply: {\"Secret\":\"consumer_key=XXXX&consumer_secret=XXXX&created=DATE&name=NAME&token=XXXX&token_secret=XXXX&updated=DATE\"}\n\n(XXXX,DATE, and NAME aren't real values)\nWhat I thought of doing is to send the token to the server and talk with the Ubuntu One API (if such a thing exists, I haven't been able to find it) to authenticate the user.\nIt'd be great if someone could tell me if I'm on the right track or if I should be doing something differently because I'm kind of stuck.\n\nAlso, I'm using the Setup component in my QML to create an ubuntu one account in case the user doesn't already have one. This seems to work for me on my Utopic desktop but doesn't work on my Ubuntu phone. I guess I need to set the applicationId, but for that I need to create an .application xml file and install it in a directory which I don't think I have access to as my app is confined.\n\nAny help is appreciated\n\nA: I can only answer to the second part of the question (about the .application file), because I'm not familiar with the services offered by the U1 account.\nYou are correct in that you need an .application file, and you actually also need a .service file as well. Fortunately, it's possible to ship them also with confined applications shipped in a click package. Your manifest.json file should contain something along these lines:\n{\n  ...\n  \"name\": \"com.example.package\",\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"my-app\": {\n        \"account-application\": \"my-app.application\",\n        \"account-service\": \"my-app.service\",\n        \"apparmor\": \"my-app.json\",\n        \"desktop\": \"my-app.desktop\"\n    }\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\nWhen the click package gets installed, the .application and .service files get processed and installed under ~/.local/share/accounts/, and their names (and therefore IDs) are changed to <package-name>_<application-name>.{service,application}, which in the example above would result in com.example.package_my-app.{service,application}.\nJust for completeness, I'm showing an example of what these files could look like:\nmy-app.application\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<application>\n  <service-types>\n    <service-type id=\"com.example.package_my-app\">\n      <description>Login into XXX using your U1 account</description>\n    </service-type>\n  </services-types>\n</application>\n\nand\nmy-app.service\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<service>\n  <type>com.example.package_my-app</type>\n  <name>U1 for XXX</name>\n  <provider>ubuntuone</provider>\n</service>\n\n\nA: You will need to provide an OAuth implementation on your server, and on your web site, allow the user to authenticate to your service via any of those other services through OpenID (or whatever shared authentication mechanism they provide). Then you would provide a plug-in to Online Accounts in your client application package, which would allow the user to log into your site via the OAuth mechanism. The OAuth token given as a result of that would be stored locally, and your client application would use that to authenticate to your server for any API communications, or just to log in and redirect to the logged in version of your web site, if it's a webapp.\n", "Q: How to identify this process In the background, there is a process taking up a lot of processing power.

Install bum using this code in a terminal window:\n  sudo apt-get install bum\n\nOnce you're finished you can use BUM right away (it requires administrative privilegies to be run), and you will be able to see a long list of active and inactive processes/apps in the list provided by BUM. To be able to learn more about a specific process/application press the ADVANCED button located in the low-left corner of BUM's window. You can uncheck, check or recheck processes and apps from that list (enable, disable, reenable them), and stop anything you consider to be either suspicious or completely useless for your needs. When you are finished, press APPLY to modify your system settings.\nBe aware that you can harm your system if you don't pay attention to all the processes/apps that you want to stop for good, and it is always a good idea to test them one by one, and not a whole bunch of them at once. If in trouble, boot into recovery mode, login, open BUM and reenable one or more esssential process(s) that you previously disabled in a hurry.\n", "Q: nrerror: root must be bracketed by zbrent What doe the error below mean?\nnrerror:root must be bracketed by zbrent\nSTOP program terminated by nrerror\n\nI get it when running a model with some inputs.\n\nA: Now I started googling the right things, it turns out that the line below is a way of handling errors where an expected input is missing that is often used in Fortran based code.\nnrerror:root must be bracketed by zbrent\n\nThe second line (below) is a formulaic abort code in fortran which you can find in \"Numerical Recipies in Fortran 90\" W.H.

The screen is just black.\nIf I enable nomodeset I'm not getting 3D acceleration using the open-source radeon drivers.\nI'm sure its this one: http://support.apple.com/kb/sp588 (I'm not at work so I can't check it).

I'm using rEFInd and I'm sure it says 'legacy OS'. So, not EFI.\n\nA: Doing some further research, I have discovered that your graphics card no longer has drivers supported by ATI. Legacy downloads are also no longer available. And as such, X11 and the Linux Kernel do not support the legacy drivers, even if you were to get a copy elsewhere. In short, it will not work at all. nomodeset is, unfortunately, your best option.\nThere is another way however.\nAs linked in a comment, this answer might be able to help you. It will add a PPA where you can get the legacy driver. However, this is very risky and I do not recommend it at all. You will be downgrading you X11 and your kernel, which may break your entire system. Do not try it unless you really, really, really, really need the full ATI card power. Other posts in that thread might be able to help you, but back up your PC and be okay with re-installing from scratch.\nIf you do follow that answer, I am not responsible for any harm done to your computer. I have given you plenty of fair warning. Backup before even trying that. And do not blame me. I did not force you to try that.Reason for Linkage: I do not condone following those steps. Consider it like a safeguard. Only view those instructions if you are okay with having to reinstall Ubuntu from scratch.\n\nFinally, the open source driver appears not to work due to a bug. I suggest you try to seek help in that forum and maybe even comment that it isn't working for you.\n\nBug #597070 -- Updated 10/18/2014\nStatus: Fix-Released 8/15/2013\n  Importance: Medium\n  Assigned: No\n\n\nA: I use a mid 2010 27\" imac with Ubuntu and everytime (thus far) it has been a real pain to install due to the complicated limbo state of the graphics card support.

Assuming your native resolution is 1366x768, you can emulate a larger screen by running the command \n'xrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1366x768 --scale 1.50x1.50 --panning 2049x1152'\n", "Q: Not able to add 3rd party software in Ubuntu 14.04 I added a 3rd party software(terminator) PPA in Ubuntu 14.04 by running the command below:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:gnome-terminator/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAnd now, when I search for that package using:\nsudo apt-cache search terminator\n\nIt doesn't show anything.\nI wanted to know, why it is behaving like this ?\n\nA: If you check the ppa page, you'll notice that there's no package version available for trusty (14.04):\n\nBut you can install the terminator package from the Ubuntu universe repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) universe\" \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install terminator\n\n\nA: *\n\n*If you want to add a 3rd party software then, go to the Ubuntu official package site, search for the package, add the ppa from there and follow the normal steps as in:\nsudo apt-get update package-name\nsudo apt-get install package-name\n\n\n*You can also install 3rd party software without adding PPA also. Install the gdebi package first used for installing package from .deb file.\nsudo apt-get install gdebi\n\nGo to the Ubuntu official package site, search for the package name, then you are given the url path there to get .deb file of that package. Download it Then install it using gdebi.\nsudo gdebi package-name.deb\n\n\nA: Try these commands in a terminal window and see if they work for you:\n      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome-terminator\n\n      sudo apt-get update\n\n      sudo apt-get install terminator\n\nI could not see any version of Terminator package built for Ubuntu 14.04 on the official page but if you still have problems with installing Terminator you can download latest version of Terminator from this link, and try installing it with GDEBI package manager rather than adding the ppa to your software sources list.\n", "Q: connect to a virtual machine remotely I create a server in my virtual machine in ubuntu. But I can connect to it only from my machine. I can not connect to my virtual machine from outside computer which was in same LAN. When I search about this problem I found that using a network bridge this problem can be solved. I refer the following article. http://www.havetheknowhow.com/Configure-the-server/Network-Bridge.html \nBut still I could not solve the problem. \n\nA: You need not to create a bridge to do that because VirtualBox does it for you.\nGo to the VM settings network tab and make sure the first network adapter has the bridge option. That's enough to create the connectivity.\nMore of it, you can enable the remote desktop access (tab Display), if you want to connect the VM with RDP.\nMake sure the VM has a valid IP address (it seems to be true yet), different from your host IP address. (And disable the bridge you created).\n", "Q: Alternative versions of Ubuntu for an old notebook I have an old notebook that has 512MB of RAM. I put Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook on it. It works, but I can't install any packages or a simple web browser. What alternative versions of Ubuntu do I have that are more compatible with my notebook?\n\nA: On such a \"low-end\" device I'd recommend Lubuntu. Lubuntu is a lightweight version of Ubuntu, using the LXDE desktop environment.\nIt is specificly designed to work on machines with low amounts of RAM, old CPU's and small harddrives.\nDownload it from http://lubuntu.net/ , burn a CD/DVD with it, and try it out in the Live session.\n", "Q: dpkg reports problems configuring huge list of python-related packages after any APT command I am having trouble installing any new packages in Ubuntu because of python.\nI tried sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev  but I am getting the following output:\nReading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information...\npython3 is already the newest version.\npython3-dev is already the newest version.\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\n280 not fully installed or removed.\nNeed to get 0 B/5,207 kB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 0 B of additional disk space will be used.\nDo you want to continue [Y/n]?

The only real solution is to install a 64bit operating system.  \nIf your hardware doesn't support 64bit or you can't reinstall right now you can temporarily bypass the problem by passing -force-32bit when you start the emulator from the commandline or by setting ANDROID_EMULATOR_FORCE_32BIT to true in your environment (as the error says). You can do this by running:  \ngedit .profile  \n\nFrom a terminal. Add the text:  \nexport ANDROID_EMULATOR_FORCE_32BIT=true  \n\nto the end of the file and save and close it. I can't test it right now but you'll either need to run source .profile from the terminal or restart for the changes to take effect.  \nTry launching the emulator.  \nIt is highly recommended that you install a 64bit operating system to continue your Android development because Google will eventually remove the 32bit binaries which will cause your emulator to stop working.

Unfortunately, those packages won't work if you're just trying to upgrade the packages and get the same things as Ubuntu/Debian have.\nThe NGINX team (or rather, myself more or less) maintains a PPA of the Mainline branch of nginx and uses the Debian package as a base for the packaging.  That PPA is located here.  You can add it with sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/development and you should then be able to just do sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade and it'd be upgraded to the Mainline version in the Mainline PPA.\nThe installation errors you're getting are because the packages in Ubuntu don't like the Upstream packages as they are not packaged the same way and have conflicted with each other in the past.  By sticking to the PPAs instead of the upstream nginx.org repositories, you will not run into this upgrade failure.\n", "Q: In keyboard > Shortcuts; How can I set the Left Alt button to no longer grab windows on mouse click?

However, we have now tried three seperate wireless printers, two of them supported through HPLIP, and all of them working with other kinds of documents. It prints checkboxes and then the word \"checkbox 2\" in bold immediately following the checkbox, so that all of the words are covered up by the bold lettering. Needless to say, this probably won't be working. Her forms aren't editable either, so we can't just put some whitespace between them. I was wondering what the problem might be, because it does work on a windows 7 starter machine.\n\nA: It seems they left the default names on each check box, instead of creating the fields properly. Instead of placing text next to the check box, the \"Label field\" should be used and the bounding box expanded to fit the text, or at least remove the text in the label field, instead they shrunk the bounding box to obscure the text.\n\nRight click on each check box and go to &rightarrow; Control... &rightarrow; Label &rightarrow; and delete the contents of the boxes.\n\nAlso check and make sure these settings are set properly: \nIf that doesn't work it most likely a problem with the printer driver.\n", "Q: How do you measure TCP packets waiting in transmit queue? I understand that there are queuing delays and processing delays prior to sending out a packets. However, do you measure those delays in linux or specifically ubuntu?\n\nA: It's difficult to reply anything accurate. First of all because TCP packets makes no sense. TCP implements a continuous data flow over IP, so a program  using a TCP connection will have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Elaborate the data and write it to the TCP socket. Maybe this is what you mean by \"process delay\".\n\n*Optionally, something like SSL can process the data (encryption, VPN)\n\n*The data is passed to the IP protocol which slices the stream, creating packets.\n\n*The packets are routed/masqueraded at need.\n\n*The packets are encapsulated in Ethernet packets (most of time).\n\n*The Ethernet packets are sent, and maybe with some random delay (network congestion).\n\n\nOn each layer of the TCP/IP stack, delays can occur (and I said nothing about error recovery). This imply you should be more accurate about which delay you want to measure. Maybe some tool like wireshark or tcpdump will help you, maybe not.\nReading your last comment,it's more clear you're investigating on application level. A profiling tool should help you then. Most IDE have one, but... the profiling itself introduces some overhead ! :-)\n", "Q: Does using -v (verbose) slow commands down? In this question: How to remove all files and subdirectories in a directory WITHOUT deleting the directory in bash? it is asked how to delete all file in a folder, and not the folder itself. \nMatts exelent answer includes the use of the -v flag to the 'rm' command. \nrm -rfv dontDeleteMe && mkdir dontDeleteMe\n\nThe command I left with was the one above. Certainly useful indeed, but does the -v flag in 'rm' and/or in general slow down tasks done through the command line?\nI have a folder with .txt-files (about 100.000 of them) that I have created, deleted and recreated for myself a few times now. Some times with rm, some times in the filebrowser, and I get the feeling it's even slower to use the rm-command as show above. Does the -v flag have anything to do with this?\n\nA: Why not find out yourself: use time.\n$ time rm -rfv dontDeleteMe && mkdir dontDeleteMe\nreal    0m0.003s\nuser    0m0.001s\nsys     0m0.002s\n\n$ time rm -rf dontDeleteMe && mkdir dontDeleteMe\nreal    0m0.002s\nuser    0m0.001s\nsys     0m0.001s\n\n\nA: Yes, the -v flag slows down the command.\nMost, if not all softwares(or commands) would check if a flag is provided, and then execute a bunch of code related to the flag. In case of the -v flag, they would likely execute a bunch of output commands(like echo or printf), which they rather would have skipped without the flag.\nThis means more instruction cycles for the processor and thus more execution time.\nIt is better if you don't use -v flag if you are not going to read/need the messages.\nOn the other hand, the CLI would/should be faster than GUI, assuming that you don't include time required to type the commands and pressing the Enter key.\nFrom this blog of superuser this image explains the slowness very well\n\nFor the specific command in question, the results of the time command are\n//with -v\nreal    0m8.753s\nuser    0m0.816s\nsys     0m2.036s\n\n//without -v\nreal    0m1.282s\nuser    0m0.124s\nsys     0m1.092s\n\nthis was done with the directory containing 100000 empty files\n", "Q: Getting icon of window, and then changing icon My goal is to get the icon which is currently on the window. (Then using some img tools I'll modify that icon, then save it to a location, I can do this part no need for help here please). Then I would like to set the window icon to the icon i have saved at a location on hard drive.\nI do this in js-ctypes so it takes me a long time so if I am going in wrong direction I waste a ton of time so it really helps to ask about it. As I can't do a quick test. If you all can just point me in right direction I would really appreciate it.\nHere was how I was thinking of doing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*I already have an array of windows (got it with XQuerySubtree)\n\n*Get RGBA data of currently applied icon with XGetWindowProperty and atom of _NET_WM_ICON\n\n*(use my img tools to modify the icon and save to hard drive, lets take for example on the desktop /usr/noida/Desktop/new icon.png)\n\n*Apply icon from /usr/noida/Desktop/new icon.png to all of the windows in the array, so it changes icon displayed on window (if there is one, in ubuntu there isnt) and changes icon in Alt + Tab menu, and changes icon on dock.\n\n\n*\n\n*apply path of icon with XSendEvent of a XClientMessageEvent with atom _NET_WM_ICON?\n\n\n\nAm I thinking in the right direction?\nThanks\n\nImage of goal - we see here that the window doesnt have an icon dispplayed on it, but its icon is displayed in the dock at the left. And in the Alt + Tab menu. So i was hoping by changing icon on all windows to my customized icon it will change on the dock and alt+tab menu. And for linux distributions that do show icon in window I hope that to be changed as well. In image here the blue arrow points to the three related icon areas. \n\n\nA: Where the icon is defined\nThe representation of an application in Dash and the the Unity launcher  is defined in a .desktop file. Such a .desktop files includes a line to set the command to run the application, a line to set the icon of the application and a varying number of possible lines to set additional properties.\nTo see the current Unity launcher's content by command:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites \n\nIf you run this command, you will (a.o.) get a list of references to .desktop files, in the order like they appear in the launcher. An application's mention in the list looks like: application://thunderbird.desktop. It refers (in this example) to the file, thunderbird.desktop.\nWhen Unity gathers its information on login, it first looks into the local directory for .desktop files, (~/.local/share/applications), and secondly in /usr/share/applications.  If a .desktop file exists in both directory, the local one has preference. Normally, during your session, the launcher's icon stays linked to the .desktop file in either one of these directories.\nWhen the content of the linked desktop file is edited during your session, the result is applied immediately. However, the icon as it appears in the Unity launcher does not change until you either:\n\n*\n\n*log out / login\n\n*remove the icon from the launcher and lock it again\n\nSince you cannot remove the icon of a running application from the launcher, changing the icon of a running application is not possible. \nTo change the icon of an application in the launcher which is not running however, you can use the two scripts below.\nThe first one copies the .desktop file to the local directory and edits the Icon= line in the local copy. The second one refreshes the icon in the launcher (and relinks it if necessary).\n\nScript 1; change the icon\nhow to use\nCopy the script below into an empty file, save it as change_icon.py, run it by the command:\npython3 change_icon.py <applicationnamme.desktop> </path/to/new/icon>\n\nfor example:\npython3 change_icon.py thunderbird.desktop </path/to/new/icon>\n\nfor smoother use:\ncreate a directory ~/bin, copy the script into the directory, remove the language extension from the script, make it executable and (after logout / login), you can simly use the script by the command:\nchange_icon <applicationnamme.desktop> </path/to/new/icon>\n\nMore info on where to store and how to define icons, you can find here\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\nfile = sys.argv[1]\nnew_icon = sys.argv[2]\n\nuser_home = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ndir_1 = user_home+\"/.local/share/applications/\"\ndir_2 = \"/usr/share/applications/\"\ndtfile_list1 = os.listdir(dir_1)\ndtfile_list2 = os.listdir(dir_2)\n\nsubject = dir_1+file\n\nif not os.path.exists(subject):\n    try:\n        shutil.copyfile(dir_2+file, dir_1+file)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"the file \"+file+\" does not exist\")\n        \ndef read_file(file):\n    with open(file) as edit:\n        return edit.readlines()\n\ndef write_file(file, linelist):\n    with open(file, \"wt\") as edit:\n        for line in linelist:\n            edit.write(line)\n\nsubject_lines = read_file(subject)\nindex = [i for i in range(len(subject_lines)) \\\n         if subject_lines[i].startswith(\"Icon=\")][0]\nsubject_lines[index] = \"Icon=\"+new_icon+\"\\n\"\nwrite_file(subject, subject_lines)\n\n\nScript 2; refresh the icon in the launcher\nhow to use\nCopy the script below into an empty file, save it as refresh.py, run it by the command:\npython3 refresh.py <applicationnamme.desktop>\n\nfor smoother use:\nLike in the script above, copy the script into ~/bin, remove the language extension, make it executable and (after logout / login), you can simly use the script by the command:\nrefresh <applicationnamme.desktop>\n\nfor example:\nrefresh thunderbird.desktop\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\ndesktopfile = sys.argv[-1]\n\ndef read_currentlauncher():\n    # reads the current launcher contents\n    return subprocess.check_output([\n        \"gsettings\", \"get\", \"com.canonical.Unity.Launcher\", \"favorites\"\n        ]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef set_launcher(llist):\n    # sets a defined unity launcher list\n    current_launcher = str(llist).replace(\", \", \",\")\n    subprocess.Popen([\n        \"gsettings\", \"set\", \"com.canonical.Unity.Launcher\", \"favorites\",\n        current_launcher,\n        ])\n\ndef refresh_icon(desktopfile):\n    current_launcher = read_currentlauncher()\n    current_launcher_temp = eval(current_launcher)\n    item = [item for item in current_launcher_temp if desktopfile in item][0]\n    index = current_launcher_temp.index(item)\n    current_launcher_temp.pop(index)\n    set_launcher(current_launcher_temp)\n    time.sleep(2)\n    set_launcher(current_launcher)\n\nrefresh_icon(desktopfile)\n\n", "Q: I can't find my Windows 7 after installing Ubuntu and creating new partition table I recently installed Ubuntu alongside windows 7 on my laptop (500 Gb hdd).

If this is the path you're going to take, shut your computer down now and don't boot into your hard drive - only boot from the live USB you originally used.\n\nA: \"Create new partition table\" ignores what's on disk and starts afresh, overwriting the data and all partitions.\nYou can try recovering your computer's recovery partitions and data by:\n\n\n*\n\n*STOP USING YOUR COMPUTER. You may overwrite what recoverable.\n\n*Boot from a liveUSB and use Testdisk.\n\n*Choose the recover partition table option.\n\n*If you're lucky and your recovery partition is recovered you may try restoring your windows installation.\n\n*Then before installing Ubuntu, in Windows, Disk Management, Shrink drive C: by 20-50 Gb to create free space for Ubuntu.\n\n*Boot liveUSB again, choose the \"something else\" option and create two new partitions, one 2-4Gb Swap partition and an ext4 partition for the rest, mount point /.\n\n\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Sound no longer recognized after latest kernel upgrade (14.04) This morning Software Updater showed notification of new updates.

I'm learning about jack. There's something called the \"buffer size\" and is measured in samples. What is it and how to choose a good buffer size?\n\nA: \nJACK Properties\nSample Rate, Buffer Size and Periods/Buffer determine the base JACK\n  latency. Their default values of 48000, 1024 and 2 respectively should\n  work with most devices but a latency over 10ms is not usually\n  considered good enough to be called realtime. Anyone interested in\n  multitrack recording may wish to experiment with these settings to\n  achieve the lowest, xrun-free latency their hardware will allow. It is\n  possible to achieve 1ms latency with good hardware and the correct\n  configuration.\n\nA smaller buffer gives lower latency. The lowest size most devices can handle is 64 but lower quality hardware may not handle any lower than 512. \nFor instance a smaller value like 128 for buffer size will help reduce latency if you will be recording non-midi instruments.\nSources: \n\n\n*\n\n*How To Configure Jack and Ardour in Ubuntu Linux for Recording Midi\n\n*JACK configuration\n", "Q: How to fix Unity locked disabled settings?

There are many references to this problem in various forums, but there seems to be no solution.

Windows version of Clementine has no such problem.) Am I wasting my time trying to get Clementine to do what you would think was now a fairly routine trick?\n\nA: You could mount the NAS instead of using Samba (which I assume you do):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install cifs: sudo apt-get install cifs-utils.\n\n*Create a directory to mount the NAS, e.g. sudo mkdir /mnt/mynasdrive\n\n*Mount the drive to the location: sudo mount //hostname/drive -o username=<username>,password=<password>,rw,nounix,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0644,dir_mode=0755 /mnt/mynasdrive. Replace <username> and <password> by the corresponding access data or leave the whole username and password section (everyting between -o and rw) away, if the drive is accessed anonymously.\n\n*Now you should be able to access the drive at /mnt/mynasdrive, so Clementine should be able to do so, too.\n\n*To unmount it again, simply run sudo umount /dev/mynasdrive.\n\n\nSource: http://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/procedure/mount-nas-storage-linux\nThe linked site also explains how to add the drive to the fstab, so it can be mounted on boot, but I think this would exceed an answer to this question.\n", "Q: Why won't rc.local run xinput?

This is the mostly likely \"truth\". The original partition was set at about 20 gig. It's about two-thirds in use now. That is what I remember from months ago, when I last had occasion to review space used/available. \nThis is what I believe happened, as I powered up the external SATA drive, the OS, which doesn't care where the boot drive is, sees that drive as the boot drive, because at one time that now external backup drive was the boot drive with / and /home and /usr and /var, etc. While the external drive was re-formatted and had a new EXT4 set, it must have some location where it continues to see the boot partition or some such. I'm not expert enough to fix this, but as the error messages are gone, I believe this was a false alarm. When the external drive is powered up before the OS is powered up, the OS believes the external drive is the bootable device. This is probably due to the external drive being connected via a pci-e card mounted on the motherboard. The card has its own mini BIOS.\n\nA: Its quite normal that u have 100% on your / :\nYour / is on a partition of 20G and your /home is on a partition of 367G\nImagine that your \"/\" is the c: partition and your \"/home\" is your d: partition in windows, on your \"/\" you will have your system files and configs ....\ntype this :\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get clean all\n\n*cd /\n\n*sudo du -csm * --exclude=home |sort -n  \n\n\nthis last command will tell u the directories than consume the most on the \"/\"\nYou can also use disk analyser in ubuntu to see the files that are eating the space in the \"/\" and deleted if not need anyone.\n** be very careful on removing files in the  \"/\"\n** ask us if you are not sure about files that u dont know.\n", "Q: How to create an iso from current installation I installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 on one of my laptops and now I want distribute that exact installation to a few of my friends. I tried making an iso with Gparted on a live session but it makes a 500 GB file (I've only used around 8 GB) . \nThanks in Advance !\n\nA: \nUPDATE November 2015\nThe new Remastersys is Pinguy Builder and there is also an app called Systemback which I prefer personally. Here is how you can install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nemh/systemback\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install systemback\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 05.01.2015\nThe link I provide in this and other instructions in step 2 does not work anymore.

I am not sure if the files are available in Ubuntu Software Center, but if you have them on your computer, they can be installed through it.\n\nTo create iso from current installation you will need a program called \"Remastersys\".\nThis set of instructions helped me install and run successfully remastersys on Ubuntu 14.04.1 32bit \n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T and run  \nsudo apt-get install plymouth-x11  \n\n\n*Go to this link and download remastersys version for 32bit or 64bit system \nhttp://www.remastersys.com/ubuntu/pool/main/r/remastersys-gui/ \n\n*Open Programs and Updates (search in Dash or in the System's parameters) \n\n*In Programs and Updates, go to Other tab and press Add...  \n\n*Copy/paste this:\ndeb http://www.remastersys.com/ubuntu precise main\n\nand press OK \n\n*Now look for two lines with \"www.remastersys.com/\" in the list you can find on the Other tab and make sure you check both boxes. Enter a password if you are asked to. \n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T and run \nsudo -i \napt-get install remastersys-gui \n\n\n*To open remastersys-gui, you always need root priveleges. So do it in the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) \nsudo -i \nremastersys-gui\n\n\nA: I create my backups and live iso files with Systemback utility, you can install it from its PPA and it works the same as remastersys (no longer maintained), i think. In ubuntu 14.04 i needed an extra package called unionfs-fuse too. It can also create live usb images. You can add your user files in iso which can then be installed on other machines, but other machines may have different graphics etc so make sure you have not uninstalled preinstalled xorg video packages. So all you need is add ppa and install\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nemh/systemback\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install systemback unionfs-fuse\n\nAfter creating iso file, creating live usb and booting from it on same machine or different machine, you will find systemback installed. \n\n\n\nA: you can try pinguy builder version 3.xx series\nfirst download the pinguy builder \nsecond install gdebi in your Ubuntu system:\nsudo apt-get install gdebi\n\nthird install pinguy builder\nsudo gdebi pinguy\n\nfourth go to start menu > system tools > pinguy builder\nenter your password\nfifth in pinguy builder, you must select backup\nthats all\njust tried it with lubuntu 14 last 10 october 2016\nhope this could help\n", "Q: Background image is not showing at login screen. 14.04 So I changed my background on my computer to an image I liked on the internet.

I sense this is the key to doing a successful import. \n\nA: First make sure that Ubuntu can see the Windows partition and make sure it's mounted (you can also do it through Shotwell).\nI assume Windows and Ubuntu are on the same PC?\n\n\n*\n\n*With Shotwell open, go to \"File\" (my desktop language isn't English, but the words should match quite closely) in the top bar and choose \"Import from map\". \n\n*Go to the map on your Windows partition, find the folder(s) you want to import and press \"OK\" once they are selected.\n\n*It should now prompt you to ask if you want to copy the pictures to Ubuntu or not: choose whatever option you like. Now they should be imported and/or copied. \nIf you chose not to copy the pictures, you will need to make sure the Windows partition is mounted every time you want to use Shotwell.\nEdit: In case I misunderstood, the other way around isn't possible (while you are logged in on Windows), as far as I know, since Windows doesn't recognize GNU/Linux (and other non-Windows?) partitions.\n\nA: The procedure that worked for me.\nTo mount (access) the Windows partition in Ubuntu, one must know that Ubuntu recognizes the partition by size not by name; therefore, the logical size item in the PLACES menu is 288GB volume. Secondly, one must know the name of the Windows file(s) one wishes to access. So, the sequence of events for me is: With Ubuntu open, Home, 288GB volume, Documents and Settings, John, My Documents, My pictures ... and for music files, substitute My Music for My Pictures. Simple enough when one knows how. Hope this will be helpful to other Ubuntu novices.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1 won't boot correctly after a fresh instalation Okay, due to some unfortunate events, I was left with 3 broken computers. Luckily, I was left with 2 dead hard drives and one working one. So I decided to just swap em' out and get a working computer again. However, this new set up ran into some problems with Windows XP wanting to be verified, and this thing wasn't likely to connect to wifi anytime soon. (This problem still baffles me) So, I decided that because i prefer Ubuntu anyways, I might as well convert the hard drive over. So i went ahead, made a bootable USB drive, and freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 onto the computer, while removing Windows XP (The hard drive really doesn't have the capacity to do a partition. 100 something Gig) So, the install seemed to go well, however, when it asked to restart, the computer didn't exactly boot up correctly, and just resulted in a plain black screen after the \"Ubuntu\" Loading screen. So, i did a second fresh install, while this time i connected it to the internet beforehand in hopes that those updates, software, and other assortments of things would fix my problem. Much to my despair, it didn't. I got it to boot up to the desktop twice, but everything but the cursor is frozen and the keyboard wasn't doing much either. a few other times, it resulted in a plain black screen, as well as, other times, a black screen with small red dots arranged in diagonal lines across the screen. \nSo, I am not the most computer literate, however, I am for from illiterate. I just don't understand what the cause of this could be, the installation went uninterrupted, and I am positive that the hard drive was the only problem with the system before i switched it out. Could this be a problem with the hard drive? or another part of the system?\nSystem Specs (or at least what i know)\nProcessor: AMD Athlon x2 64 bit\n3 Gig of RAM\nHard Drive 250 Gig, from Windows XP Media center edition 2005\n(i thought it was much less. must have had a lot of junk on it)\nIf there is any other information that i would need to provide, i would be happy to do so.\n\nA: I ran into the same issue with my system that has similar specs.  I was able to get my system to boot by booting into recovery mode with the graphics fail safe settings enabled.\nInstructions for booting with low graphic settings\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot PC leaving SHIFT pressed to make the GRUB Menu show.\n\n*Select Recovery Mode which will continue booting correctly until the Recovery Menu appeares.\n\n*Select from the recovery menu failsafeX.\n\n\nThis allowed me to use my system some before installing another graphics card, but you might be able to update the graphics card driver at this point.  This link has some directions for attempting driver updates.\nSystem Specs - Processor: AMD Athlon x2 64 bit 2 Gig of RAM Hard Drive 200 Gig, from Windows XP.\n\nA: This question is hard to answer because it could be multiple things. You could have a corrupted Ubuntu ISO. Did you ever compare the MD5 hash of the ISO to the one it is supposed to be? Try re-downloading the ISO file if you have a computer available. Also, I have had video cards that for some reason hated Linux and would do things like you mentioned. If you are using a video card, try another one if there is an extra one available or integrated graphics.\n", "Q: How to get Netflix video and sound out to TV using Ubuntu I was trying to watch a movie on Netflix using Ubuntu OS.

Before this, I could connect to the machine through TightVNC from my Windows 8.1 laptop.\nHowever after the upgrade things didn't run smoothly. It is now a known bug that usual VNC software can't connect to Ubuntu 14.04 because it uses security TLS type (18), which TightVNC doesn't support.\nMy question is: is there any freeware available (for Windows) that does the job like TightVNC, but supports TLS security type 18?\nThe bug I report is mentioned here.\n\nA: I used x11vnc for the server and realvncviewer for windows.

I was wondering how I would save my script as a command and then be able to call that command anywhere in the terminal. So i could save the command in a folder somewhere, but be able to use that command in a different folder without having to type out the path to said command.\nIs there a way to do this? For example, I make a script that runs chmod +x 'file' and then takes an argument for the file to run the command on. How would i go about coding this and then saving it so i can call that script from anywhere.\nSorry if i didn't explain my question too well, and thank you for any help with my problem.\n\nA: Let's assume that you often place random scripts in ~/bin as one of the comments mentioned. Just open your ~/.bashrc (provided that BASH is your shell of choice) and as the last line add:\nexport PATH=\"${PATH}:~/bin\"\n\nand that's pretty much it. You can add any directory to your PATH environment variable this way and it will allow you to run any executable file from any location on this system. If you want to add more directories, just prepend each one with a colon, i.e.\nexport PATH=\"${PATH}:~/bin:otherdir:yetanother\"\n\nJust remember that this will only work once you open the terminal again or if you don't want to, just reload BASH configuration with:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n", "Q: Package Operation failed on every installation I'm extremely new for the Ubuntu(Linux systems), my question is when I install any program in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ,its giving a message like below(sine times error is different but like this too).and also when I install software using terminal or software center ,the error is same like this..\nalthough the error is occurred installed softwares are working properly please help me to solve this.\nError were encountered While Processing:\nSamba\nwinbind\nError in function:\nSetting up samba(2:4:1.6+dfsg-1ubuntu2.14.04.3)..\nsmbd start/pre-start, process 1120\nstart: Job failed to start\ninvoke-rc.d:initscript samba-ad-dc, action \"start\" failed\ndpkg:error processing package samba(-configure):\nsubprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\ndpkg:dependency problems prevent configuration of winbind:\nwinbind depends on samba(=2:.4.1.6+dfsg-1ubuntu.14.04.3);however:\nPackage samba is not configured yet\ndpkg: error processing package winbind (--configure):\ndependency problems- leaving unconfigured\n\n\nA: Did you, by any chance, interrupt an install process?

So i suspect is something about the application permissions. Does anybody knows how should i configure apparmor (or any other stuff that i need) for having permissions  to execute this thumbnailer as root?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You could try to run your application with the unconfined template.\nIn your application manifest file you should have the following lines:\n\"hooks\": {\n    \"myapp\": {\n        \"apparmor\": \"myapp.json\",\n        \"desktop\": \"myapp.desktop\"\n    }\n},\n\nThen in the myapp.json apparmor profile, use the following snippet:\n{\n    \"policy_groups\": [],\n    \"policy_version\": 1.2,\n    \"template\": \"unconfined\"\n}\n\nSee: Application Confinement\n\nA: I finally found a better solution than using the unconfined template. It was easier than expected... only needed to include \"video\" as part of the policy group:\n    \"policy_groups\": [\n        ... \n        \"networking\",\n        \"video\",\n        ...\n    ]\n\nIf, aditionally, you need to access video files, you can also add \"video_files_read\" (only read video file) or \"video_files\" (complete access).\nYou can check all the available policy groups when developing an app in Ubuntu Sdk, into QtCreator, going to Publish tab and double click on app.apparmor file. You'll find a + symbol which will show you all the policies when clicked.

But if you're looking specifically for an IDE there's the \"Bluefish\" editor that can help you in the development but there are many others also. Since you're gonna be developing PHP websites you'll need a server and probably a database software if you're gonna be making SQL based websites, you can use LAMP (`Linux Apache Mysql and PHP) server, it includes the server and the database, the webserver is the most important and required software for PHP development.\nNote that the webserver installed on your personal machine is just for development purposes you should avoid using it for hosting your website online.\nFor image and graphics - You can use \"Gimp\"(for image editing) and inkscape(for vectors)\nYou'll probably need browser plugins like firebug(for firefox) to help you debug you html css and javascript code directly from the browser.\nColor Pickers(if you're gonna be doing the design too) like colorzila. \nYou may also need other kind of tools as you develop different websites according to your need.

That is to say, what they alter changes depending on what directory you're currently in. I suspect the instructions intended for you to be in your Wordpress directory before you ran this but that you fired these off before changing directory...\nSo if my suspicions are correct, you've changed the permissions on your home directory. That's pretty bad. You can check this with ls -l (while in your homedir).\nPutting it right isn't so easy. At the very least you can re-own all your files with:\nsudo chown -R $USER: ~\n\nThe permissions mask 755/644 isn't terrible but some things like ~/.ssh need more restrictive permissions in order to work.

There are two different times used by linux, UTC and your local time based on your time zone. UTC is the same for everyone, local times change with location. When setting times, make sure you know how the program will interpret the time you are giving it. \nWhen I set repetitive tasks, I like to set the crontab myself with the editor rather than changing the daily or weekly folders. From the terminal, type:\n sudo crontab -e \n\nAnd add your commands to this table directly. This way, all of the user's repetitive commands are held in one place. The default file contains instructions on how to make an entry, but the manpages for crontab have a more in depth description.

I have a Dell Latitude E6430 laptop, running Ubuntu 14.04, connected to a 27\" Apple Cinema LED Display (which works fine). By tweaking the appledisplay kernel module a little bit, I can even get proper entries for the backlight in /sys/class/backlight and change the brightness using echo XXX > /sys/class/backlight/appledisplay/brightness.\nAs icing on the cake, I'd now like to have the brightness keys on the laptop (which do work for the laptop screen) also control the big display's brightness. Unfortunately, this doesn't work - I was assuming that as soon as a new backlight device is available, it's also connected to the brightness keys.\nAny hints?\n\nA: A.F.A.I.K. there is only one device that gets affected by the brightness controls (and it is supposed to be the internal display).\nWhich one is controlled by kernel parameters for example, when it comes to issues.\nA good writeup on that can be found here:\nhttp://hansdegoede.livejournal.com/13889.html\nTo get to what you want: I guess you can just write a simple script that sends those commands and map them to keys?\nYou can get the key events by using evemu-record as root.\nIf you look in that direction I am sure you can figure it out.\nIf you want to go the kernel way, check what options like acpi_backlight=native or acpi_backlight=vendor do.\nI know the latter makes a device specific entry, that is probably changeable to the one you created.\nGood luck and let us know how it goes :).\n", "Q: Cron Job Creation Okay, so I have had a quick look at the answers posted on this question and re-formulated my cron job. So, let me break this down as clear as I am able to:\nPC/OS | Shell Info\nI am currently running Lubuntu 14.04LTS x64 on my Toshiba Laptop. Basically I have (at present) a shell script that copies directory A, B, C, D, E, F and G to my Dropbox Directory, and a local copy. For all intents and purposes, let us call this example.sh which is stored in the folder /home/user/documents. I have read up on Cron Jobs, watched a few videos etc. and have had no luck with this. \nTo clarify, I have tested the script and it works. My first idea was the following: \nOpen a terminal and run crontab -e and manually add the following: \n30 * * * * michael home/Documents/example.sh\n\nand even \n@hourly michael home/Documents/example.sh\n\nI have tried as root, and as also removing the user part. This has not helped.\nRecently, I watched a video of where you go root and navigate to etc/cron.hourly/ and create the file, and change the ownership. I employed all of the above (followed the video exactly) and I was still not able to complete this process. Confused, I tried to re-do process 1, and instead of home/michael/Documents I pointed to the above location and have had no luck.\nThe frustrating point here is I am missing something incredibly simple (like, uh, this question I did!!). \n\nA: Creating your crontab file with crontab -e is probably the best method for you, but starting your crontab lines with the # character tells the system to ignore those lines. Remove the # and leading whitespace before the 30 in your crontab line. Should just look like this:\n30 * * * * /home/michael/Documents/example.sh\n\nAdditionally, please ensure that cron is running ( ps -ef | grep cron ) and that your user is permitted to run cron jobs. If you are unaware of how to do this, reference the \"Enable User Level Cron\" section in the following link for specifics on how to enable cron on a user level:\nUbuntu Community Help - CronHowTo\nTo see more about what cron is doing and why, run this command:\nsudo grep -i cron /var/log/syslog | less\n\n\nA: Some points that seem to be confusing you:\n\n\n*\n\n*# is the comment character. Adding it to the beginning of a line makes cron ignore that line.\n\n*Don't mess with /etc/cron/hourly etc. There's no need to and they have a different format (see next point).\n\n*The format of a user's crontab is\nminute hour day-of-month month day-of-week command\n\nThe format of the files under /etc/cron is different and also includes a user name:\nminute hour day-of-month month day-of-week user command\n\n\n*You need to give the full path. Paths in Linux always start with a /. That represents the root directory, the equivalent of Windows' C:/.\n\n*You need to make sure your script is executable. Run chmod +x /home/Documents/example.sh to make it so.\nSo, to run a script that is located at /home/Documents/example.sh (note the leading /) every 30 minutes, you would run crontab -e as yourself, not root, and add this line to it:\n30 * * * * /home/Documents/example.sh\n\nSave and close the crontab and you're set.\nNOTE: In general, a useful troubleshooting trick for this kind of thing is to redirect the error output of your script to a file:\n30 * * * * /home/Documents/example.sh 2> /tmp/mycrontab.log\n\nThat will create the file /tmp/mycrontab.log where any errors produced when attempting to run your script will be printed.\n", "Q: How to create daily offsite backups of a server, prepared on the server then pushed/pulled offsite? after some weeks of trials, configurations, setups and reading of tuts and howto's i finally got my server working with some services, (email server, music streaming) etc.\nDuring my attempts I also tried different backup solutions, rsnapshot, bacula, luckybackup.\nSome solutions I could not get working completely (bacula) others didn't do what I really wanted: Creating a backup of the server, which could be used to restore it, after using a resque, a minimal ubuntu 14 install. \nSince I started from the minimal install to build the server, I'd like to backup the whole thing, without the music / movies (who are on a seperated partition). \nThe to be backupclient is a Intel Xeon 16Gig Ram 2 x 3TB HD's in Raid, located in a datacentre.\nThe to be backupserver is a Intel Quadcore 4GB of Ram 1TB HD located at my home. with Ubuntu 14 Desktop on it.\nA second backupserver could be an I7 system, 16GB of Ram, 256 SSD, 3TB HD with Windows 8.1 on it. \nI would like to have some suggestions on how to make such a kind of backup to work.\nI don't mind installing / configure things by hand, following a how to or tutorial :) But finding a good one is the trick these days... lots of them are outdated and/or copied ones.

To achieve this, hold \"shift\" during boot. This will cause grub to display its menu. On the default entry, type e. \nThere should a line starting with linux similar to the following: \nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-37-generic root=UUID=4be10ae8-1a19-485a-a24a-bde836584090 ro  quiet splash $vt_handoff\n\nAt the end, append init=/bin/bash and remove quiet splash $vt_handoff so it looks like:\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-37-generic root=UUID=4be10ae8-1a19-485a-a24a-bde836584090 ro init=/bin/bash\n\nThen press Ctrl+X and your system will boot but instead of starting services like your graphical environment you will be dropped to a shell.

I come from a Windows world where Chrome automagically updates itself without any intervention (other than the occasional browser restart, since I leave my browser open all the time.)\nIn Ubuntu, I frequently notice Chrome listed in Update Manager. I don't recall if I installed Chrome through apt-get or not.\nWhy does Chrome rely on apt-get for updates? Is there a way to have a \"Windows-like\" experience where it updates itself without my intervention? This is my goal. \n\nA: As parto said, you can just make it update in the background. To do that here are two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a startup script that runs as root (see here: How to run a script during boot as root) with the contents\n\n\napt-get upgdate && apt-get upgrade chromium -y\nYou may need to change the name of chrome to whatever the package name actually is.\n\n\n*You can do the same thing with a cron job, and run it as root (see here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1015485/is-it-possible-to-make-a-bash-file-run-as-root-in-crontab) with the same contents\n\n\nAlso, Rinzwind has a good point in the comments - you're likely using chromium as Google Chrome doesn't use apt\n\nA: No, there is not a way to get the \"windows-like\" experience of having Google Chrome \"update itself.\" \napt-get is the cleanest and most well-integrated (from OS perspective) of managing updates for your system. \napt-get also affords the system admin a good \"one stop shop\" for controlling versioning and updates. For these reasons, Google made the design choice to have automatic updates be ran by apt-get for the simplicity and convenience of the user.\n\nA: Chrome adds it's own repository on install. On https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/ it states:\n\nNote: Installing Google Chrome will add the Google repository so your\nsystem will automatically keep Google Chrome up to date. If you don’t\nwant Google's repository, do “sudo touch /etc/default/google-chrome”\nbefore installing the package.\n\nSo unless you do that before you install it should add a repository that will keep Chrome up to date with the system upgrades.\nPicture of my sources after deb install:\n\nSo yes you will get updated versions of Chrome when doing updates. (either through Software Updater or apt-get update and apt-get upgrade)\nSo no intervention required if just do your updates like normal, I suggest letting it do them daily, as the update process is less intensive with only a handful at a time, and there are no forced restarts, and the old version of a program can stay in memory while it is currently being updated - so it is be perfectly fine to have programs open while they are being updated.\n", "Q: Need to know how install a exe with a different program , oter than wine I use viewers for open sims and grids, Like second life and osgrid, I downloaded coolviewer and opened it with wine, it loaded ok but when I try to use it  goes to \"not responding\"   I  have to shut it down!! What causes this? I found were you get the terminal, but do not understand its im new to this ! Is there another program I can use to open window downloads?\n\nA: The short answer is: you probably can't. Wine occasionally works, as the other answers suggest, but more often than not the program will be unusable.\nThe best solution would be to simply find software made for Linux that will do the same thing as the \"viewer.exe\" that you so vaguely described. Without a description of this program though, nobody can recommended new software to you.\nThe second-best solution would be to install a Windows virtual machine with VirtualBox. You'll need a copy of Windows, and about an hour to install the virtual machine.\nAs a side note, why are you afraid of the terminal? The terminal is the single most advantageous thing about Linux over Windows (although there are many, many more advantages), and you're completely disregarding that. It's truly not that hard to learn.\nSo I hope this all helps you with your usage of Ubuntu!\n", "Q: Booting up to Grub Screen \n*\n\n*Yesterday I noticed that my ubuntu drive (installed with Wubi) would suddenly go read-only.  This happened several times yesterday, but I would reboot and everything would be fine.  it seemed like this happened very rarely even a few days prior.\n\n*Now when I boot up Ubuntu, I go straight to an empty Grub command line (it just says \"Grub\" and there's a command line prompt).\n\n*My windows partition is totally fine.  I'm able to read and write files, and am indeed writing this post on that partition.\nQuestion 1: Is there any way to save my Ubuntu files from Windows?  I have an external harddrive.  There was priceless configuration files that I'd like to retrieve.\nQuestion 2: Is there any way to fix and salvage my existing set up?  Should I be afraid my hard drive is general is in imminent danger of failing for Windows as well?\n\nA: Question 2. Probably not. No way to tell, but if it is failing you'll see some strange behaviour in Windows as well. Corruption of Wubi installs is fairly common, since they seem more vulnerable than normal Ubuntu installs, and this can be triggered by a crash (also not uncommon) that leads to the corruption. If you have ever forced a reboot, then look no further. This is a well-established cause of Wubi corruption. (Always use Alt+SysRq R-E-I-S-U-B to safely reboot)\nQuestion 1.\nIn general, the steps to follow are:\n1. Run chkdsk /r in Windows. This will repair the Windows partition that holds the Wubi \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk.\n2. If necessary, fsck the root.disk from an Ubuntu live DVD.\nHowever, step 1 is not without risk. It's possible that it doesn't repair the disk and you end up with a 0 byte disk that is a dead-end.\nFor this reason, if you really cannot afford to lose your data, you might consider running photorec on the root.disk or booting a live DVD and mounting it read-only to back up data before attempting the repair.\nHere are some links to assist with the above:\nHow can I recover files inside a Wubi install before re-installing Ubuntu?\nHow to recover Ubuntu data if it's installed inside Windows?\nTo run photorec, you'd boot a live DVD and then run photorec on the root.disk, sort of like this, but instead of /dev/loop0 you'd use the /<path to>/root.disk\nJust remember which methods are destructive (chkdsk, fsck) and which are not. Attempting to mount and copy or running photorec are not. BUT if the root.disk is already badly corrupted you may not have a choice.\nOnce you have your data, I'd recommend a normal install, or if you choose to reinstall with Wubi, keep your important stuff synched off the root.disk e.g. to /host/xxx (natively on the Windows host partition).\n", "Q: Reconfigure system (network) during boot based on HyperV information I am running a HyperV environment with Ubuntu 14.04 server running in generation 1 guests setups.  It runs nicely.\nI want to be able to clone the system (while shut down), give it a new name, and have the new system reconfigure itself slightly - different static IP, different LVS setup, different Apache2 setup, etc.  I am doing that by copying over the appropriate configuration files (i.e. the system has multiple copies, it replaces files like /etc/network/interfaces with the right one)\nI cannot find an appropriate place in upstart to do this.  Doing it before local-file-systems the file system is not available read/write.  Doing it after, e.g. in if-pre-up.d during network startup collides with the system's own configuration (i.e. I'm replacing /etc/network/interfaces after it has started using it). \nIt is not desirable to have it fully boot and run a script as it will pop up on the network with an IP conflict, potentially affecting the parent of this clone.  So I want to do it during boot.\nI have somewhat gotten this to work by rebooting a second time from if-pre-up.d, after moving the files, before allowing it to finish coming up.  But that seems a bit wrong for various reasons, not the least of which it then stops in grub (or whatever that boot screen is) and requires an ENTER key. [I've posted a question on this elsewhere, if you can help with that, please answer there.]\nIs there an appropriate place in upstart's sequence that I can overwrite network interface files (and related service files like keepaloved, apache2, haproxy) and have them processed normally? \n\nA: I have continued to beat on this and have it working, though it is not pretty.\nI put in a if-pre-up.d script, and took OUT the eth0 device from /etc/interfaces (which is the device I want to configure). \nThen when this fires (which may be multiple times), I manually configure eth0 with ip command lines (e.g. ip addr, ip route, etc.).  I also wrote the /etc/resolvconf file for dns servers.\nI added a line at the beginning which notices if eth0 is already configured and exits, so if it runs multiple times I only do the work once.  Doing command line configuration and leaving eth0 out of /etc/interfaces keeps it from conflicting with the normal configuration of eth0.\nIt's ugly, but I was unable to find an appropriate point in upstart between the local filesystem being configured, but before the network configuration started.  At least in theory I could change the associated /etc/init files so I could insert such a step, but that seems fragile, especially during updates.\nThe result is a self configuring guest that can run in Hyper-V, look at its host name, and configure itself - IP addresses, other startup/config files, etc.  In this way I can clone one copy to many, and get all sorts of different setups driven by a simple script.\nThis works... but I would sure welcome a better answer.\n", "Q: If I cat file to other file is there way to get them separate again? If I use cat pic1.png >> pic2.png is there way to get the pic1.png out of that pic2.png? \nI know it works if I simply use some archive file and just simply unarchive it but I want to know is it possible other way.\n\nA: With cat file_b >> file_a you are just appending the content of file_b to file_a. No format change, no other manipulation (1)(2). \nYou can go back by just removing the last bytes of the files; probably something like \n head --bytes=-$(wc --bytes file_b | cut -d\" \" -f1) file_a > old_file_a\n\nshould work. \nExplanation: \nwc --bytes file_b \n\nreturns the length of file_b in bytes (and the name of the files, like \"5678 file_b\")\nwc --bytes file_b | cut -d\" \" -f1\n\ngets rid of the file name in the output of wc by keeping just the first field (\"5678\"). Then we use a process substitution to put that number as an argument to head:\nhead --bytes=-5678 file_a \n\noutputs all the contents of file_a but the last 5678 bytes. \n\nFootnotes: \n(1) In the OP example, I doubt that the pic2.png file is still a valid PNG file...\n(2) Included in \"other manipulation\" is the fact that there is no recording of the original length of the file or any marker that separate the two files. If after the cat you delete file_b you have no way to separate them again without knowing the length of the original files. An archiver format (tar, zip, rar) is doing exactly this bookkeeping for you (and compress and checksum and other thing, sometime). \n\nA: One way is to look at the PNG file format\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics#File_header\nThe PNG file format has a header and a series of chunks that define the way a PNG file is constructed. If you chain through the chunks you should be able to extract the PNG files. You might get lucky and just use the first 8 bytes of the PNG file as an identifier to find the separation point.\n", "Q: Package system in broke in Xubuntu 14.04 I have been using Xubuntu 14.04 LTS\nWhenever I update my Linux I get a error as per the screenshot.

In a LINUX system the Virtual Address Space is 4GB here as the Physical Memory depends on the RAM which we are using. For example I have a system of 1GB RAM and my Monitor requires 256MB in-order to address it's pixels. Will the RAM take care of it or the monitor will have it's own memory that can access the Kernel Module directly? \n\nA: To be clear, your monitor itself does not \"require\" certain amounts of RAM, but your GPU might. Also, RAM cannot manage anything other than some very low-level functions within itself.\nWhen your system boots up, the BIOS or EFI will decide how much (if any) RAM your integrated GPU will need and \"hard reserve\" it from your system RAM to be used exclusively by the GPU.\n", "Q: Would Android apps be able to run in Ubuntu touch natively? I'm wondering why Android apps won't be able to be run natively on Ubuntu Touch. I mean, isn't it all just Linux?\n\nA: The short answer is \"no.\"\nStrictly speaking, the Linux kernel provides little more than a direct interface to the hardware it is running on. There is an entire stack of additional Android-phone-specific APIs, programs, applications, etc. on which Android applications depend. Additionally, Android does not run on a generic Linux kernel, but instead runs on one that has been highly customized by Google with the specific purpose of running their OS.\nEven if it is technically possible to reproduce the entire stack required for Android applications to run on another system, it would be bloated and extremely inefficient.\n\nA: Nokia n900 runs maemo witch is a linux os and yet it can run android's app via the dalvik environement wich was develloped for it but never put on market or repisitories. Why? Only the society who developped the dalvik for n900 knows. Now there was another initiative call apkenv. Seems there's was not so much thing's to add to make the n900 running some android games and no matter about the gpu or cpu power or maemo's desktop the apps run there some lake like in any emulation but some runs perfectly some not. So about ubuntu touch it is not question of technic (may be i am wrong but one official ubuntu's touch phone is a xiaomi wich is used for android too so hardware is nor a problem in this case) but will and law thout that google won't be happy that ubuntu runs android app and use the google play as second repository (note that is is possible to download the .apk as .deb and install after).\n\nA: The answer to your question is a BIG NO.\nAndroid is completely different from Ubuntu Touch although android is based on linux kernel but that does not mean that the native applications of android can run on linux and vice-versa. \nThe similarity in kernel between different OS doesn't make their applications executable on these  different OS. Kernel is the lowest software layer of a system. Above kernel lies user space which consists of system software and application interface.\nOS with the same kernel may have entirely different user spaces and native applications execute in a particular user space.\nMoreover, Android apps are developed usually using java and android apps execute in a runtime environment (Dalvik or ART) which takes bytecode from JVM as an input , whereas linux applications are directly converted into machine code upon compilation.\nApplications developed for android using C++ cannot be executed in linux environment directly rather they have to be compiled first for linux systems.\n\nA: This is a really old post so things are different now, yes you can run android apps on ubuntu touch but by using a compatibility layer like anbox or waydroid.\n", "Q: Software updates I'd like to know if I can differ/delay the Software Updates on my computer because it is annoying for updates every ~ 2 to 3 hours.

How can I grab some files from my Ubuntu root drive within windows?\n\nA: You would require a ext filesystem driver for windows to access ubuntu files from windows.Download ext2 driver from the below link:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsd/\n\nA: Unfortunately,  I don't think you can. Unless you use a 3rd party program, Windows can only read NTFS, FAT, or FAT32 type drives. Ubuntu is installed on an ext3 or ext4 type drive.

The physics engine runs \"properly\" at around 30 FPS. On my machine, the game runs at around 50 FPS.\nThe fan site recommends using dxtory to limit the frame rate. This program runs at a fairly low level which the wine implementation of directx in wine doesn't support.\nIs there any way to get the game to run properly?\n\nA: I don't think there is a way to modify Wine to restrict the framerate, and the problem you're having is clearly a bug in the program, not Wine.

Go to http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35 and run the installer. I'm assuming you're using PlayOnLinux, so you need to follow some short instructions to make sure itruns in the prefix. Open PlayOnLinux, click on the program in PlayOnLinux's menu, and click on Configure at the top of the window. Choose Miscellaneous and choose the option to run an .exe in the drive.

I have dual boot with Windows set up, and am having no issues there.\nI did some troubleshooting and can ping IP addresses (e.g., google's 8.8.8.8, and others), so I am suspecting a DNS issue.  When I compare IP configs for my Windows vs. my Ubuntu, all the settings appear identical - including the DNS Server IP address.\nI found and followed the advice in this question, especially because, upon reading it, I am pretty sure I'd shut down while I was logged in to a VPN earlier yesterday.

I rebooted as well.\n\nA: If you can ping 8.8.8.8 and receive a response but cannot ping google.com then it is most likely a DNS issue. \nCan you ping your dns server?

Is there a way to force the terminal to request my passwords one by one?\n\nA: I don't know if there's a way to force the terminal to ask sequentially but in any case, assuming you are connecting through ssh, a better solution would be to set up passwordless access.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a public ssh key on your machine:\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nYou will be asked for a passphrase which you will be asked to enter the first time you run any ssh command after each login.

How do I do this?\n\nA: First check if the Ubuntu Unity interface isn't still installed by clicking on the Ubuntu logo next to your name in the log-in screen. Maybe the Unity interface is still installed.\nThis post explains exactly how to change between different versions of *buntu. The easiest way would be to install Ubuntu Desktop before removing Xubuntu Desktop (if you want to remove it, you can  also keep both Ubuntu and Xubuntu installed so you can switch at will, but you will have a lot of (double) software installed and use more HDD space.)\n", "Q: Problems installing Oracle java 1.8 I'm running Ubuntu 14.04.

They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nHow can I get vsftp installed on my system? \n\nA: Applying solution posted by Mikewhatever in how-to-install-software-or-upgrade-from-old-unsupported-release resolved this issue (earlier posts in that thread did not).\n", "Q: After 12.04-14.04 upgrade, Google-talk malfunctions I have an HP Business 64 bit desktop partitioned between Windows 7(Hp version) and Ubuntu. I upgraded from 12.04 long term to 14.04 long term. Google phone (aka Gmail Call Phone) functioned perfectly in 12.04, using a USB headset w/ microphone. Now there is no incoming sound, (either ring-tones or sound) from the receiver of the phone number being called. I used my own land line to confirm this. At the phone number being called, sound from the USB  mic DOES come through, loud and clear. When the called phone hangs up, it does not end the call in the Google Phone display. Most bizarre of all, this happens with or WITHOUT the Google voice plug-in enabled! It also occurs using both Firefox and Chromium browsers. The plug-in remained in place during the upgrade for both browsers. \nDuring the upgrade, a small window informed that there had been one malfunction.\nHas anyone heard of anything else like this? Does this seem like it ought to be a Bug Report? \nCan I revert to 12.04? Google phone is a big reason to stay w/ Ubuntu, though it had no effect on my decision to put Ubuntu in my machine.\nI'm going to send a report to Gmail about this, but since this a a tiny problem in one operating system, I don't expect much.  \nFWIW: a big reason for the upgrade was to see if Youtube and other audio and video functions would improve. The improvement is dramatic. Unfortunately, the failure of Google Phone is more dramatic.\n\nA: I would suggest confirming that your headset works with something like Audacity, and then try reinstalling the Google Hangouts plugin from here. You may also want to remove the Google Hangouts repository using the Software Sources app before attempting to reinstall the plugin. I use this on Ubuntu 14.04 and I was using it on 12.04. I did not do a direct upgrade, but rather backed up my data and did a fresh install of 14.04. \n", "Q: Install ADT Eclipse \"You are installing software that contains unsigned content\" I am a newbie in Ubuntu.

From official site\nIn Readme file you can find it.\n\nSETUP\nRsync normally uses ssh or rsh for communication with remote\n  systems. It does not need to be setuid and requires no special\n  privileges for installation.  You must, however, have a working ssh\n  or rsh system. Using ssh is recommended for its security features.\nAlternatively, rsync can run in 'daemon' mode, listening on a\n  socket. This is generally used for public file distribution, although\n  authentication and access control are available.\nTo install rsync, first run the configure script.  This will\n  create a Makefile and config.h appropriate for your system.  Then\n  type make.\nNote that on some systems you will have to force configure not to use\n  gcc because gcc may not support some features (such as 64 bit file\n  offsets) that your system may support.  Set the environment variable\n  CC to the name of your native compiler before running configure in\n  this case.\nOnce built put a copy of rsync in your search path on the local and\n  remote systems (or use make install).

Without the patch applied, the driver compiled. However it seems either to map incorrectly or to just not work with my 148f:760b (<- notice the b instead of 1) usb adapter. I even modified the devices list to add a new alias, but even after loading the driver or a bunch of other stuff related to it, the adapter just was not recognized.\nBut when I installed the driver in Windows 7 (didn't seem to work on Windows XP) and after the installation process copied over the driver folder located in C:/ProgramData/Mediatek Driver/RT2870 Wireless LAN Card/Driver/ to Ubuntu and loaded it with ndis wrapper and with ndiswrapper-dkms package, the adapter was immediately functional. Actually, on Windows side it didn't recognize my wlan at all for some reason but on Ubuntu it was just one click and I was immediately online wirelessly.\nSo, odd behavior here and there but finally working.\n\nA: You're probably not using Ubuntu 12.04 anymore, but in any case, here's the solution for the compilation error you had when patches were applied:\nThe patches only work out-of-the-box with linux kernel >= 3.5.

I have a virtual machine running in VMware. It has Ubuntu 14.04 on it. I want to install LXC containers on it, and have them use the same address space as the virtual machine. \nSo, I created a bridge interface and put the ethernet port in it. I then have my LXC containers add their interface to the bridge.\nIn theory, this should just work. And on physical machines it has. I can ping by LXC containers from the LXC host (virtual) machine. But I can't ping them from anywhere else, including other VMware virtual machines.\nI did some research, and it seems VMware's virtualized \"switch\" for the VLAN coming into the VMware host machine does not work like a normal switch. It already knows the MAC addresses of the machines attached to it, and drops traffic coming from any other MAC address. In essence, it does not learn MAC addresses because it already knows them. There is a VMware option to turn this off, but instead of making the virtual switch learn MAC addresses, it just turns it into the equivalent of a hub, with every machine on the virtual switch getting all traffic crossing the switch. (That is something I do not want to do -- both for performance and security concerns).\nSo, I am left thinking I need to do the equivalent of NAT except at the ethernet level for outgoing packets on the bridge to make them what VMware thinks it should be. And then rewrite incoming packets that are actually for the containers back to the right mac address. To this end, I found https://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnections#Setting_up_the_rules That seems like it should work. But I have one problem: I need to also do IPv6. While I think I can probably figure out how to rewrite stuff to an IPv6 address, I also need to rewrite the IPv6 equivalent of ARP so that hosts know where to find it in the first place too. \nSo, what rules do I need in ebtables to do ethernet level, MAC address \"NAT\" (rewriting outgoing MAC addresses) for IPv6?\n\nA: There is no such a way to do a mac-NAT.\nIn fact, the outgoing MAC is always rewrited because MAC is used between machines linked DIRECTLY. The source MAC must be the MAC of direct sender and the destination MAC must be the MAC of next hop. In stead, IP is used between both direct-linked machines and indirect-linked machines for routing.The source ip is the ip of original sender and destination ip is for final.\nBut fortunately, NAT for ipv6 is avalible indeed just via some changes in the NAT table.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 not downloading I am trying to download ubuntu 14.04 from the ubuntu site. Though my internet speed is fairly good, it becomes too small <14kb/sec when the ubuntu download starts and the download never completes.\nI have downloaded ubuntu many times before too but sucha  problem never came.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Use a torrent client instead of downloading the iso image directly, install Utorrent if you're downloading from within Windows, or Transmission if you are downloading from within Linux, and download the torrent file from official Ubuntu download page, load torrent file in utorrent/Transmission, and the iso image should be present on your desktop in just a few minutes.\nBy the way, I suggest that you scroll down on the download page and choose Ubuntu 14.04.1 version instead of Ubuntu 14.04. The links for torrent downloads are marked with .torrent at the end.\nIf Ubuntu download page is the only page where you are experiencing download speed limitation, and you can download at high speed from other pages check with your Internet provider, and ask why this happens. If you have the same problem when downloading other software then there must be something wrong with your Internet connection, either some firewall related issues or some serious conflicts generated when using both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols at once.\n", "Q: Can't enter password in nagios3 installation wizard I am trying to install nagios 3 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 using How do I install nagios?\nI have entered sudo apt-get install -y nagios3 followed by my password.\nI then get the dialog in the link below:\n\nThe text below \"Nagios web administration password:\" looks strange almost as if I have entered it (which I haven't).\nThe text in the screenshot also looks different to that in the guide I am following.\nI don't appear to be able to enter a password into the dialog and the only keys that the dialog will respond to are the arrow keys and the enter key.

The most likely reason is that at some point you edited this script from a Windows machine and a \\r was added to the end of the line. You can check if anything is there on that line by running\ngrep 'if [ \"$exit\"' script.sh | od -c\n\nThat will show all characters, including non-printing ones. \nIf you do indeed have a \\r there, you can fix it by running\"\nsed -i 's/\\r//' script.sh\n\nOr, installing dos2unix (sudo apt-get install dos2unix) and running\ndos2unix script.sh > fixed.sh\n\n", "Q: error in shuffle in fetcher#1 Hadoop I'm trying to run the Hadoop pi example.

The machines should be able to ping each other (between master and slaves, but also between slaves). Depending on your setup, you might need to modify the /etc/hosts files on the machines, so that they are able to ping each other by hostname.\nFor example, /etc/hosts could be configured as follows:\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n<ipslave1>  slave1\n<ipmaster> master\n<ipslave2> slave2\n\n", "Q: Install Adaptec RAID 6405 on Ubuntu 12.04 (3.13.0-37-generic) I'm trying to install an Adaptec RAID controller on Ubuntu 12.04.

You need to check your slow query log to find those queries.\nCheck by SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST which shows the queries that are running and waiting for some other resources.

I'm trying to change my root partition from ext4 to zfs (simple partition, without ZFS volume management functions) by moving all files in a live system (Ubtunu 14.04) from the ext4 partition to an external device, creating a ZFS pool on the partition and moving files back. \nThere're a lot of guides out there explaining how to setup OSs, including Ubuntu, on a root ZFS pool, but I didn't find one explaining the simple migration I want to do without setting up a ZFS boot partition/dataset as well (the most useful I found was http://blog.ls-al.com/ubuntu-on-a-zfs-root-file-system-for-ubuntu-14-04/). Of course it's possible to abstract the steps from such guides, but I'd rather have some little pointer from experts rather than doing a trial-error approach myself.\nGeneral problems: Currently I'm suffering for a lack of understanding how to tell my system to mount a ZFS partition under /' at boot. Although it is not recommended I guess settingmountpoint=legacyand adding an entry in/etc/fstab` (like I'd do after a migration to another filesystem type) should be sufficient, right?\nActual problems: \n\n\n*\n\n*If I create the pool with zpool create /dev/sdaX, I get the message ALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/<uuid of my root partition> doesn't exist. When I create it with zpool create /dev/disk/by-id/<id> I get /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: failed to get canonical path of/dev/when I run update-grub in chroot in live system. What Do I have to specify inzpool create`?\n\n*Do I have to setup the system in chroot from within the live system at all (import the pool, update initramfs)? I copied my files back to a dataset named rpool/ROOT/ubuntu-1 and added rpool/ROOT/ubuntu-1 to /etc/fstab (in that very dataset). \n\n\nRunning mount -t zfs rpool/ROOT/ubuntu-1 /root && chroot /root zpool import rpool in initramfs shell doesn't work because zfs module isn't loaded. ubuntu-zfs is installed and I used it for a data partition for a long time without trouble.\n\nA: The kernel parameters boot=zfs, bootfs and rpool aren't set correctly by grub (\"updates\" from ppa:zfs-native/grub are for raring only) and have to be added to /boot/grub/grub.cfg to the linux statement(s) of your choice, see https://github.com/zfsonlinux/pkg-zfs/wiki/HOWTO-install-Ubuntu-to-a-Native-ZFS-Root-Filesystem for details.\n", "Q: I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 and have trouble with Wi-Fi This is the output of the wireless script that has been requested by the admin.

I am not going to be uploading them to the Archive as they are for my own use.  \nCan anyone point me to a tutorial or a document on creating font packages?\nI have managed to create a wallpaper package using dpkg-deb but I have a feeling that I need to do something more as I would need to run fc-cache as well.  \nI do not have the source files to these fonts as I have just downloaded them from the web so I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nA: When installing a font package, you don't need to run fc-cache manually. In the past, this used to be done by a postinst script included in each font package, but now fontconfig installs a dpkg trigger that automatically regenerates the font cache whenever a new file is placed in /usr/share/fonts by any package.  \nSo a Debian package for a font file, is extremely simple. You just need a debian/install file that places the font in the correct directory, like:\n*.ttf usr/share/fonts/truetype/myfont\n\nSee the Debian font team's packaging policy wiki page for more information.\n", "Q: Two \"Windows 7 loaders\" in Grub2 screen I've installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on the same hard drive(sda) which already has Windows 7 OS installed on another partition of this hard drive and I also have a second hard drive(sdb) which is just for backup purpose(no OS installed). Now the problem is, when the computer boots up to the Grub2 window... it shows Ubuntu and two Windows 7 loaders(sda1) and (sdb1).... I formatted (sdb) thrice using Windows 7 OS and Ubuntu OS and Gparted application.\nHow do I get rid of this second \"Windows 7 loader(sdb1)\" ? \n\nA: Normally when I see 2 Windows entries in GRUB it is because of the system partition Windows 7 installation creates apart from the actual partition (C: Drive) you would use. The system partition is normally around 100 MB. When GRUB reads that it sees that the filesystem is Windows 7. When it continues reading partitions it sees your C: which is also Windows 7, and so it shows both. There could be other cases that it could show 2 partitions, but this is the most common.\nThere are several ways to remove that entry, but the easiest way would be with Grub Customizer:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nOpen Dash and type grub customizer. From there you can simply delete the entry and save the changed.\n", "Q: How can I change the number of password entry attempts allowed by sudo? By default, sudo prompts me to input my user password a maximum of three times if I input wrong password. How can I change it to unlimited times(?)? How can I make it so that it asks me for my password until I enter the right one?\n\nA: This is documented in man sudoers. The setting you are looking for is:\n passwd_tries      The number of tries a user gets to enter his/her pass‐\n                   word before sudo logs the failure and exits.  The\n                   default is 3.\n\nSo, to change that to, for example, 5, run sudo visudo and add these lines:\n## Allow a user to attempt to enter a password 5 times\nDefaults        passwd_tries=5\n\nAs far as I know, there is no way to set it to unlimited times but you can simply use a huge number:\nDefaults        passwd_tries=99999999\n\nThat is unlimited for all intents and purposes, unless you have a user with a very severe case of OCD, they won't attempt to enter a password more than 100 million times.\n", "Q: Trouble installing Ubuntu on Chromebook I've been attempting to install Ubuntu on my Chromebook HP 14 using crouton.

I'm using a manual enviroment with Juju, and to not lose the machines I've added them all as machinename.local (using avahi-discover). It's not possible to use static ips because of some rules from administration.\nWhen I add a relation between a service and a mysql, for example, the $db_host always gets the ip and not the domain from mysql host.\nHow do I make relations with $db_host as an avahi domain instead of an IP?\n\nA: First, a few things to understand about relations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Juju doesn't have much to do with deciding particular relation settings (eg. a choice between IP address or domain name). It is up to charms implementing a particular relation type to decide what relation data to set.\n\n*As an exception, Juju does set the private-address relation setting by default for convenience, but charms can delete or change it.\n\n*Juju provides private-address in the relation setting as well as the output of unit-get private-address as an address, not a name.\nSo, that you're ending up with an IP address and not a hostname is a function of both the charm that you're relating to and Juju's defaults, depending on the case.\nLooking at the mysql charm, I see that it sets host (in hooks/db-relation-joined) based on the output of unit-get private-address.\nSo, one option is to modify each charm where it sets the address, and change it to supply the name you need instead. Or where charms just use the default private-address setting, to override it in the *-relation-joined hooks. In your environment using something like a call to hostname and appending .local would do. But this is clearly not a great solution, since you have to modify every charm affected.\nUnfortunately, most charms are designed for environments that work the other way round - where IPs generally don't change (or an administrator has control to make sure that they don't), but mDNS (as needed for Zeroconf) generally doesn't work, and there's no central DNS server available. So although Juju doesn't particularly mandate charms to support addresses only, this is generally what the charms in the charm store all do.\n", "Q: Clear disk space to in the boot folder?

The screen just flashes and it doesn't lock. I have tried installing and reinstalling gnome-screensaver in synaptics and still the screen doesn't lock. Any ideas ?\nthanks,\nKind Regards\neins\n\nA: It seems that somehow my user got added to the nopasswordlogin group. Removing my user from this group would solve the problem so I solved this by going into the terminal and typing in the command line:  sudo gedit /etc/group and deleting my user name from the nopasswdlogin group in the text file and then saving the file again. Now I can lock the screen and the system requests a password on the ubuntu login screen. The screen wouldn't lock before because there was no password with which to lock the screen. The system didn't request a password because the user was in the nopasswordlogin group. Thanks.\nKind Regards\n", "Q: Worrying messages in syslog I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04.

When I try \"grep [^834] file.txt\"  it still prints all the lines containing 834 but just doesn't highlight them.\n\nA: Try\ngrep -v '[834]' file\n\nFrom man grep \n   -v, --invert-match\n          Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

Depending on what your file consists of, this will probably find almost anything. \nTo show \"everything but\" grep has the -v switch. E.g. something like grep -v \"8\\|3\\|4\" should work.

I use it to skip the first name, which is given by ^[A-Za-z]+\\\\s, meaning beginning of line (^), then at least one letter, no matter if captital or not, then a space (\\\\s).

I like to copy man pages to my own offline documentation where I can highlight and supplement the information with my own notes.  However, I always have a problem with the exported text containing linefeeds at the end of every line, including in the middle of paragraphs.  The process of stripping away the unnecessary linefeeds is annoying and time consuming, and I was hoping to find a simple way to initially export the information with the linefeeds only in their proper places.\nI have examined the man command man pages and surprising have not found a solution to this problem.  The closest I have come to fixing the problem is to use the ‘-c’ option while stretching the terminal window to be as wide as possible, however this is not a very effective fix for large man pages with lengthy paragraphs.  \nOne interesting thing the ‘-c’ option shows me is that the locations of the LFs are indeed possible to be modified by the man program— So why isn’t the program capable of just removing the unnecessary ones altogether?  Is there a simple command I that I’ve missed somehow?\nThanks in advance..\n\nA: From what you describe I guess you have text files with line breaks after a fixed width, which will look ugly in a window that is to small for this width. Right?\nIf so you could use \n    cat mytextfile | tr \"\\n\" \" \" > mynewtextfile\n\nto strip away all the newlines. There's not really a way for a program to decide which ones are \"necessary\" and which aren't. \nIf you want to keep all double newlines that might mark real paragraphs try something like that:\n    cat myfile | tr \"\\n\" \"#\" | sed s/\"#\\([^#]\\)\"/\"\\1\"/g | tr \"#\" \"\\n\" > mynewfile\n\n...assuming that you do not have any meaningful # in the text (might use another dummy character instead if this is the case). \nAnother possibility might be to save HTML versions from e.g. http://linuxmanpages.com and edit those in an appropriate program. \n\nA: Ah, I found the solution!  You need to set the MANWIDTH environment variable before calling the man command, such as like this:\nMANWIDTH=10000 man ls\n\nThis will set the width of the columns to be so wide that the linefeeds are never added in the middle of the paragraphs.\n", "Q: SSH + Keys + noip I'm hoping you guys can help.  I've been searching for along time with reading the information on noip.com and couldn't figure out anything.\nI've set up an SSH server on a home computer.  I changed the port # in sshd_config and forwarded my port number to the router.  I can connect to my sever fine if I am on the same network as the server (using ssh -p port# me@private.ip) and can connect fine from a different net work using (ssh -p12xx me@public.ip).\nI have setup an noip account and have attained a host-id \"me.ddns.net\".  downloaded the noip-DUC updater to update my ip address.  My question, when i tried to ssh -p port# me.ddsn.net (my host name on noip doesn't use the @ symbol), I got a error Permission Denied (public key). To be clear, I can still connect to my server fine using the private ip and the public ip, just not via the host name from noip.  As I've mentioned, I do use ssh-keys and have disabled password prompt.  Do I need to configure an ssh-key for noip or upload my ssh-keys to noip?  I've only been messing with SSH for 24 hours and is very unexperienced.  I appreciate everyone's advice.\nThank you.\n\nA: First of all, You NEVER upload your private keys to anywhere. \nLet's get this right. \n\n\n*\n\n*Server is running ssh_d service on a different port (12xx)\n\n*You forwarded 12xx port on your router to the server. \n\n*You can connect if you are on the same network using ssh -p 12xx user@server.ip\n\n*You can connect if you are on another network using ssh -p 12xx user@noip.address\n\n*Both connections you are using the same origin box (i assume laptop)\n\n\nPlease verify this so we can help you troubleshoot your issue. \nJust to give you a heads up since you claimed this is your first time playing with ssh. \nYou need to use the \"@\" to connect if you are running locally with a different username than the one you want to use on the server. \nThis is:\nusernameA [laptop] ---> ssh ---> usernameA [server]\nIn that case, you would use:\nssh -p 12xx youraddres.no-ip\n\nIf you use different usernames, then you have to specify it by using \"@\". So if this is the case:\nusernameA [laptop] ---> ssh ---> usernameB [server]\nYou should use:\nssh -p 12xx usernameB@youraddres.no-ip\n\n", "Q: juju bootstrap fails with connection refused errors We have the following MAAS setup-\nOne node is setup as the server with both MAAS cluster and region controllers running on it.

In particular note step 5: \"Shut down all existing MongoDB processes\"\n\n*Don't use IP addresses when configuring a set or a cluster, use hostnames instead, even if they are just in /etc/hosts rather than DNS, they provide a level of abstraction that is very useful if you are dealing with an environment where the IP address is transient and you cannot control what IP and instance receives when it is rebooted.\n\n\nTo fix this, you will need to restart the mongod and mongos processes, basically following the procedure linked in 1 above.

Now I just want to keep a copy of the backup on my laptop, but it will not transfer over.\n\nA: There are rules to naming files. A - is an illegal character at the front of a file name since it indicates that the next part of what is typed is an -option- to the command used. Example with touch (but also applies to cp or mv and other commands): \n$ touch -1\n$ touch: invalid option -- '1'\n$ Try 'touch --help' for more information.\n\nThis works (the -- informs the system that there are no options but the - is part of the filename:) \n$ touch -- -1\n$ \n\nIf you use different file system it is adviced to use a file name convention that is supported by both filesystems. \nSo analyzing your notice I would say that you should rename the file named -6 since the system assumes it is an option named -6 that is not part of the command used (ie. \"not supported\" as stated in the notice).\n\nBy the way: you should consider this a -bug- and report it to the maintainer of the software used. In my opinion that software should take care of this by using above method to end the instructions options to copy the files over to another system (in the same fashion a space will break the command if not taken into account since a space is considered the end of a filename and the start of a second filename if the filename is not surrounded by double-quotes).\n\nA: I had the same problem with my HTC One M8 and solved it using a solution provided here: Stack Overflow: Unable to mount SAMSUNG_Android in UBUNTU\nThanks to Sven\nAttention: It could be, that you need to enable the \"usb debugging\", to see the device by \"lsub\".

I was thinking since ubuntu for androids has already been delevoped, why isnt there a way we can all instal it to our androids?\n\nA: Ubuntu isn't an app.  It's an operating system.  You already have an OS on your phone which allows you to do many things including downloading and running various apps.\nPeople often change or modify their android OS by burning a different image.\nWhen you burn a different image to your android/phone you risk bricking it.  If this happens, of course you've voided the warren-tee and would need to get a new phone.\nAt present the list of Android devices is short.  If you want an Ubuntu device strong enough you might consider purchasing a supported one.\nLook at this ubuntu development support site:\nInstalling Ubuntu on devices|Ubuntu Developer\n\nA: Only one secure option which I found is Android app Complete Linux Installer from Play Store. \nYes, for some devices there are sollutions, but that's are dangerous if you are not advanced user which love ADB etc. and (mainly) biggest reason why not do that is old repositories for some solutions, such as Ubuntu 13.04 for Nexus 7 2012.\nI use Complete Linux Installer with installed Debian with VNC, I can connect to tablet from deskop,...

I dont know much about scripts, so please do explain :) .Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You may find it helpful to check out this thread.\nHere's a quick summary as suggested in the comments:\n1) install python-nautilus and python-mutagen with sudo apt-get install python-nautilus python-mutagen\n2) Set your PYTHONPATH variable by following the instructions here.\n3) Create a directory called python-extensions in ~/.nautilus\n4) Download this python script and paste it into ~/.nautilus/python-extensions\n5) Restart nautilus with $ nautilus -q && nautilus &\nI still recommend reading through the thread though, there is a lot of useful information there.\n\nA: I quickly made a python script which calls mediainfo process for each file in a search criteria and sorts then by sorting criteria and prints out the results. Modify for your own needs.\nThis uses pure string sorting for the values. You could also add reverse=True for sorted method if wanted or do whatever you want with the code otherwise. This script requires you to pass arguments with ' around them. Sort criteria argument can be any value that mediainfo returns from the files.\nimport os, sys, glob\nimport pprint\n\n# Call: python mediainfo_sort.py 'search_criteria' 'sort_criteria'\n# Call example: python mediainfo_sort.py '*.avi' 'Bit rate'\n\nfiles = glob.glob(sys.argv[1])\ncriteria = sys.argv[2]\n\n# Will have data in format: {'file_path': {'Media Attribute', 'Value'}}\nfile_datas = {}\n\n# Contruct data by calling mediainfo for all files in \nfor file_path in files:\n    mediainfo = os.popen('mediainfo \"%s\"' % file_path).read()\n    file_data = {}\n    infos = mediainfo.splitlines()\n    for info in infos:\n        if ':' in info:\n            info_split = info.split(':')\n            file_data[info_split[0].strip()] = info_split[1].strip()\n        file_datas[file_path] = file_data\n\n# function for sorted, uses Media attribute (sort_criteria) value as sorting key\ndef getKey(item):\n    return item[1][criteria]\n\nsorted_files = sorted(file_datas.items(), key=getKey)\n\n# In the end just join the keys (filenames) with newline and print\nprint '\\n'.join([x[0] for x in sorted_files])\n\n\nA: Like I mentioned in my comment, the mediainfo command is really, really slow. There are better alternatives I think. \nHaving said that, here is my version of a python script, that should do the job (python3):\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\ndirectory = \"/path/to/files\"\n\n# list the files in the directory\nfiles_tosort = os.listdir(directory)\n\nfiledata = []\nfor file in files_tosort:\n    # combine filepath and file, take care of the whitespaces\n    filepath = directory+\"/\"+file; command = \"mediainfo \"+\"'\"+filepath+\"'\"\n    # get the file's data\n    data = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    # extract the bitrate from the output\n    bitrate = [line[line.find(\":\")+2:].replace(\"Kbps\", \"\").replace(\" \", \"\") \\\n               for line in data.splitlines() if \"Bit rate\" in line][0]\n    # add the found bitrate+filename to he list\n    filedata.append((int(bitrate), file))\n\n# sort the list by the bitrate\nfiledata.sort(key=lambda item: item[0])\n# print out\nfor item in filedata:\n    print(\"bitrate: \"+str(item[0])+\" Kbps\\t file: \"+item[1])\n\nIt creates an output, looking like:\nbitrate: 606 Kbps    file: film1.avi\nbitrate: 731 Kbps    file: film10.avi\nbitrate: 790 Kbps    file: film4.avi\nbitrate: 802 Kbps    file: film3.avi\nbitrate: 845 Kbps    file: film6.avi\nbitrate: 919 Kbps    file: film7.avi\nbitrate: 984 Kbps    file: film5.avi\nbitrate: 1023 Kbps   file: film2.avi\nbitrate: 1088 Kbps   file: film8.avi\n\nNote:\nif there is a risk of unreadable files, a \"try / except\" should be built into the script, to pass in those cases.\nHow to use:\nLike with any script, copy the script into an empty file, set the path to the files in the head of the script, save it as sort_video.py and run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/sort_video.py\n\n\nA: Using command mediainfo and sort I'm able to sort about 100+ videos in less than 10s:\nmediainfo --Inform=\"General;%OverallBitRate% | %CompleteName% (%OverallBitRate/String%)\\n\" * | sort -n\n\nHowever, it sorts videos by the global video file bit rate and not only by the video stream bit rate.\nSample output\n1091318 | videoA.mkv (1 091 kb/s)\n1505121 | videoB.mkv (1 505 kb/s)\n8803070 | videoD.mkv (8 803 kb/s)\n11192962 | videoC.mkv (11.2 Mb/s)\n\nHow it works\nRunning mediainfo with a template through the Inform parameter we ask print firstly OverallBitRate with only numeric characters.\nWe ask to look for all file of the folder recursively matching *.\nThen we pipe all the result into the sort command, with the -n parameters indicating we are sorting numeric values.\nAs the later character of %OverallBitRate% is non-numeric (space is not a numeric character), sort -n will only consider firsts numeric characters.\nThat's means that sort -n with look to digits before the | separation which separate the overall bit rate and the file name.\nNotes\nPer line, mediainfo seem to be limited to only one section using the --Inform parameters. So if FileName would be printed, you can only get the OverallBitRate instead of BitRate (which is really close) as BitRate is in Video section and OverallBitRate however is in the General section as the file name is.\nThe difference is that OverallBitRate also contain audio bit rate along the video.\nAs seen, that's not really a python script: mediainfo itself could do most of the work making the python script non required.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 14.04--Grub Rescue Error after failing to turn off secure boot Whenever I try to start my computer it shows the following error:\nfile /boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod not found \nEntering rescue mode... \ngrub rescue> \n\nI tried installing Ubuntu 14.04 onto my computer which was preloaded with windows 8.1. My goal was to make this a dual boot.\nI primarily followed these instructions\nI accidentally skipped step 5, which was turning off secure boot, and is most likely what led to my current error. Ubuntu installed on my computer but I was unable to run it past the live session which prompted me to try out Ubuntu and/or install it again. But now I can't even get there.\nIn frustration, I removed my flash drive and that is when I arrived at this screen, which I can't seem to get out of.\nIf helpful, entering the command ls on the grub rescue mode prompt outputs: \n (hd0) (hd0,gpt 12) (hd0,gpt 11) (hd0,gpt 10) (hd0,gpt 9) (hd0,gpt 8)...

I've tried things like, quit, exit, lsmod, but none have worked.\n\nA: So I just now was able to successfully make my laptop a dual boot.\nThe way I got rid of the grub rescue prompt was actually by changing my boot mode from Legacy Mode to UEFI. I did this by booting into the bios menu when I turned on my computer by pressing f2 (for me). I then scrolled over to Boot and switched this under the Boot Mode option.\nThis got rid of the grub rescue screen upon powering up my machine. When I turned it on, it took me straight into Windows with no option to choose Ubuntu. My next step was to disable secure boot (see http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn481258.aspx for more info on this).\nNOTE: the disable secure boot option does not appear until after you switch to UEFI. I was now able to turn Secure Boot Off. The way to do this was also on the BIOS menu. I simply scrolled left to the Security tab (NOTICE: you should see an option for Secure Boot on the Bottom. You need not disable this, since my next instruction will disable it). I scrolled all the way down to Reset to Setup Mode and pressed enter. This Clears PK, disables Secure Boot (see for yourself on that screen) and enters Setup Mode. On a side note: I tried simply disabling Secure boot many times, saving it each time but this did not change anything when I restarted my computer (still booted to Windows automatically).\nAfter this, when I rebooted I had the option to choose Ubuntu or Windows (since Ubuntu was already installed).\nI did this on a Lenovo P400. My understanding is that this whole UEFI thing is unique to new operating systems, including but not limited to Windows (8 and 8.1)\n", "Q: Wi-Fi connected but no network access I have dell inspiron 15r turbo 7520 with windows 8 pre installed.

My problem was, that after I had run the zpool import Storage command, my disks wouldn't show up anywhere (nor should they!!!). After you import the ZFS Pool, you need to mount the drives. If you've installed ZFS on Linux then you can run the mountall command and the mountpoints will be mounted in your system.\nA bit of trivia\nIf you take a look at the zfs list i posted, the NAME corresponds to (in my case) the user's drive on the ZFS Raid array. The MOUNTPOINT corresponds to the place where you want your ZFS drive to show up.\nSo if you run zfs set mountpoint=/media/Storage/Others Storage/Others it will mount the Storage/Others \"drive\" in your /media/ folder. Note that you will need to mount the parent drive in order for anything to show up. I.e. I would need to mount Storage before being able to mount Storage/Others.\nI hope this makes sense, if not, let me know and I will calrify. Also, someone with a bit more knowledge about this subject might find what I've written to be misleading, if so, let me know. This is just the way I understood it.\nAlso, this thread helped me\n\nA: Just to clarify, zpool import alone doesn't import pools, you need to provide the name of the pool or import all pools with the -a parameter. If you do that, all datasets should be mounted automatically. You probably need create folders below the mountpoint that don't exist.\n", "Q: Choose Window with Keyboard from GNOME Activities?

It contains the\n# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.\n# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for detailed information about\n# the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian about Debian specific\n# hints.\n#\n#\n# Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian:\n# The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to\n# upstream's suggested way to configure the web server. This is because Debian's\n# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,\n# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in\n# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as\n# possible.\n\n# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined\n# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:\n#\n#   /etc/apache2/\n#   |-- apache2.conf\n#   |   `--  ports.conf\n#   |-- mods-enabled\n#   |   |-- *.load\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   |-- conf-enabled\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   `-- sites-enabled\n#       `-- *.conf\n#\n#\n# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces\n#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the\n#   web server.\n#\n# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is\n#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be\n#   customized anytime.\n#\n# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/\n#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,\n#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,\n#   respectively.\n#\n#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their\n#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our\n#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See\n#   their respective man pages for detailed information.\n#\n# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in\n#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with\n#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not\n#   work with the default configuration.\n\n\n# Global configuration\n#\n\n#\n# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's\n# configuration, error, and log files are kept.\n#\n# NOTE!

The encryption key is derived from your password, so you'll need to remember your password to recover your files. If there was a backdoor, encryption would be useless.\nI recommend that you create a new account and work in that new account. Try to remember your password; if you manage to do that, transfer your old files. How do I recover my data from an encrypted home directory? may help if you remember only part of the password.\nIf you want to keep your home directory encrypted, write down your password somewhere and keep it in a safe location.\nRegarding your problem with lightdm, we can't help with so little information (purged what?). Try to go back to your old working setup, and don't uninstall packages if you don't understand the consequences. You can find a log of package management operations in /var/log/apt/history.log (and history.log.0, etc. for older operations), this should help you retrace your steps.\n", "Q: Increase virtual screen size past 4096 x 4096 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I have two 27\" monitors with a 2560 x 1920 resolution each.

And what's the difference between extra and NEW packages.\n\nA: There are three basic ways an Ubuntu package can depend or pull in other packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Depends - this is a hard dependency, the program you are installing requires this other package to run. If you try to uninstall one of these packages, your program will be uninstalled with it.\n\n*Recommends - this is a package the is needed or recommended for normal use of the program you are installing, but the program will work without it. By default Ubuntu will install these (unless disabled with --no-install-recommends) but it won't complain if you remove them later on.\n\n*Suggests - this is a package that can enhance the program you are installing but is not considered a part of normal use. These packages are not installed by default (unless enabled with --install-suggests) and would be considered like a \"hey, you might find these interesting\" from the package developer.\n\n\nBy default, Ubuntu installs packages marked as depends and recommends, and all these will be listed as extra packages, unless you specified some of them explicitly on the command line.\nPackages marked as NEW are all the packages that are about to be installed, i.e. the packages specified on the command line and all extra packages.\n", "Q: Chrome freezes after exiting full screen mode in Netflix So Ubuntu has recently announced the support of Netflix using Chrome v37+.\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 with Chrome 37.0.2062.120 (64-bit), and I have a problem specifically with Netflix.\nWhen I exit the full screen mode after watching a video, and either press the little red cross to close the tab, use Ctrl+W or middle-click on the tab, Chrome freezes and I get a prompt to close the application because it stopped responding...\nAnyone else having this problem? Any idea on how to diagnose it?\n\nA: Try to disable in Google Chrome the \"Use hardware acceleration when available\" and check if you have a better experience. It's not a solution, but at least a workaround. It did the trick for me.\n", "Q: Cannot make a screenshot using Print-key on Gnome 3.10 I use Ubuntu 14.04 with GNOME shell 3.10.4. Pressing the [Print]-key will cause the screen to shortly turn dark - as it seems to be custom on Ubuntu for capturing a screen.\nBut afterwards there is no screen shot available to be pasted on the clipboard.\nDoes somebody know how to repair or troubleshoot this issue?\n\nA: The screenshot should automatically save to the ~/Pictures folder:\n\nYou can get the prompt to save or copy the screenshot (right) by using the 'Screenshot' dialogue (search in the overview for screenshot, or run gnome-screenshot --interactive). This also enables you to include options such as whether to include the mouse pointer etc. \nYou can also set in Keyboard settings what commands can be used for Screenshots - so you for instance to screenshot copy to clipboard by using Ctrl+Print Screen (or whatever is set in the settings):\n\nIf you want to have the screenshot dialogue open, add you can add a custom keyboard shortcut to launch gnome-screenshot --interactive - I use Super+Print Screen:\n\n", "Q: Eye tracking mouse cursor for Ubuntu Is there any software to control mouse cursor using eye or finger via web camera in ubuntu?

And have problems copying data to it whenever i update it on my Ubuntu Machine.Can anybody suggest me how to make a script for Ubuntu such that whenever i mount it copy the newly dumped data from my PC HDD to my external HDD?\n\nA: You could use a script, running in the background, checking every (for example) 20 seconds if the disc is mounted. If it is, it runs an rsync job (once) to upload/update the files on the external disc.\nThe script below is an example, and so is the suggested rsync job. use man rsync for more information on rsync.

First, localhost and JAZZ are both on local loopback addresses. 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.1.1 respectively.\nThe 'loopback' range of IP addresses is 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255.  All of those are considered \"local loopback\", and any of those addresses is technically considered 'local'.  It does not hurt, however, to put localhost on 127.0.0.1, and $HOSTNAME on its own, 127.0.1.1, or some other address within that namespace.\nConsidering that 127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.255 is all considered local loopback, it doesn't really matter which address gets assigned locally within that namespace when referring to your own hostname.  (Having said this, it is customary in your /etc/hosts to have localhost as 127.0.0.1, as that is typically how the system handles it.  You can put it, theoretically, onto anything, but 127.0.0.1 is the default and is typically what its on.)\nAs well, your source quotes the following:\n\nThe special hostname localhost is associated with the IP address\n  127.0.0.1, and describes the machine you are currently on (which normally has additional network-related IP addresses).\n\nIt's specifically referring to localhost, and not the hostname for your machine.\n\nYour second one is about your dynamic IP.\nThat should be in its own question, but I think we need to redefine what you're asking.  You ask this:\n\nAnother query: Can I use my dynamic IP (as configured by DHCP in my wifi connection) as a localhost to host my html or php files?\n\nLets change this to ask this:\n\nCan I use my dynamic IP assigned by my wireless router with other systems to host my HTML or PHP files?\n\nI redefine your question like this because you can't use localhost outside of your computer.  127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.255 only work on that one computer.  If you're asking to use your dynamic 192.168.x.x (or whatever private IP range is configured on your wifi) address for your files, you'd be referring to your computer with that IP instead of localhost, elsewhere on your network.\nTo that end, either your router needs to be able to resolve HOSTNAME queries from other systems and point to the private internal DHCP address, or each other system needs to have their hosts file edited to point hostname to the DHCP address.\nNow, if you want to host files OUTSIDE your network, you're going to need two things: (1) Dynamic DNS address from some dynamic DNS provider.  (2) port forwarding from your router to your internal computer address. (There's other questions and answers for doing this one, though, hence why i'm not going into detail here)\n", "Q: Pulse Audio EQ Alternative I have been using ubuntu 14.04 around 3 weeks as my primary os.

If you have to Ubuntu disk, pop that in and boot into the live environment (try Ubuntu without). Then open gparted, and partition your drive yow you want. Then shutdown, and insert your windows 8 install disk.  Make sure you click the customize option, and choose to install it to the correct partition.

I've recently discovered that I can connect myself to a web server using nautilus (so I don't need stuff like winscp).\nSo I did manage to connect myself to my web server, and started to download some files.\nBut I've found a couple of things missing:\nHow do I know when it finished? And how many files did already copy?\nAnd how do I go to a higher folder level than the one that it is opened by default? There's no \"upper\" arrow as in ftp programs.\nI've tried several, quite a lot ftp programs and I love winscp (which I couldn't make it work with wine, by the way), so the thing that's quite close to the easy way of winscp is nautilus.\nIs there a way to do achieve two things? Thanks!\n\nA: When copying files, even from a network location, Nautilus should open a popup window showing the file copying progress, and when it should finish etc (if one does not appear, it likely has been small enough to copy over quickly):\n\nTo navigate up a directory, just press the location button for the directory on the top bar - you may also be able to use Alt+Up or similar.\n\n", "Q: Google Search garbled on Firefox on Ubuntu 14.04 I recently updated Firefox on Ubuntu 14.04.

Do I need to be carefull with virus passing from the ubuntu virtualbox to the real hard drive on windows?\n\nA: If you are not copying between them then no...\nMost of the viruses will not run on linux/ubuntu therefore will not infect the host OS.\nA better thing to do is to install calmav on ubuntu and have a good antivirus on windows.\n\nA: The probability is extremly low. The Linux guest will not (be able to) run a virus designed for Windows. Thus it can't infect anything. There might be a vulnerability that affects Virtualbox that might be used to infect the host system. Can't be ruled out, but I have never heard of the like. And since this would have a very limited audience, it's not likely that anyone would code such a thing.  \nBut: If you use shared folders to copy files back and forth between host and guest or share the clipboard, you might quite easily bring some malware onto your system, though, in a way that it would be accessible from the windows side, too. You might be unfortunate enough to run it then, while working in windows. So be sure to wear an uptodate virus scanner nevertheless. And just for good measure, installing clamav (an Open Source virus scanner running on Linux, used mostly for finding Windows viruses in data stored on a Linux system) in the guest won't hurt. \n", "Q: Dual boot Windows 8.1+Ubuntu12.04 - can't boot on windows I got a Toshiba Sattelite S70-b-110, with windows 8.1 pre-installed.\nI partitioned my HDD into 4 :\n C:/ (Windows install) ; \n P:/ (Windows Data and installed programs) ; \n Ubuntu install (/) ; \n Ubuntu swap ;\nI had installed Ubuntu 14.04 and everything was great!

You can assign alias IPs to interfaces, so maybe you can assign all the available IPv4 addresses to it. (Or maybe 3.4×10^38 with IPv6).\n(Of course, with physical interfaces, and one IP per interface, the answer depends on your motherboard.)\n\nA: The IP address being used by a application depends on the IP address the application 'binds' on.

Rather than update youtube-dl which is working fine the way it is, I went to your playlist webpage, copied the URL and ran the following commands from the terminal:\nsudo apt install jq # command-line JSON processor    \ncd Desktop/    \nyoutube-dl -j --flat-playlist \"https://<yourYoutubePlaylist>\" | jq -r '.id' | sed 's_^_https://youtu.be/_' > batch-file.txt  \n\nThe results of these commands were a list of all the links on that webpage. I made a batch file with a list of the URLs of all the videos in it (only the videos, not the other links), each video URL on a new line. After that I could download all the videos with a single command by following these instructions. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a batch file which is a text file containing a list of URLs of videos from YouTube that you want to download. The URLs should be arranged in a list having only one URL and nothing else on each line, with a new line for each URL in the list. Save the batch file with a name that is easy to remember like batch-file.txt. If the multiple files are all on the same user, channel or playlist webpage in YouTube, you can generate a text file with a list that has all the links on that page by running the following command:  \nyoutube-dl -j --flat-playlist \"https://<yourYoutubePlaylist>\" | jq -r '.id' | sed 's_^_https://youtu.be/_' > batch-file.txt \n\n\n*From the terminal run:\nyoutube-dl -ct --simulate --batch-file='/path/to/batch-file.txt'\n\n\n*This is the basic command, however you also need to add the formats of the videos that you want to download or else you may find yourself downloading videos with formats that you didn't want. So first simulate your download to see if the format you want is available:\nyoutube-dl -ct -f 34 --simulate 'http://www.youtube.com/some-alphanumeric-string'\n\n\n*If the video format is not available you will get an error message that says: requested format not available. If the video format is available you will not get any error message when you use the --simulate option. You can also add the -F option to see all valid formats like this:\nyoutube-dl -F 'http://www.youtube.com/some-alphanumeric-string'\n\n\n*In the above command I have used the common flv 360p video format: -f 34. You might prefer to try the flv 480p video format by using -f 35. After you have added the video format that you want to the command, the command becomes something like this:\nyoutube-dl -f 35 -ciw -o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" --batch-file='/path/to/batch-file.txt'  \n\nI didn't add the --simulate option to the last command, so this command would be executed for real.\n\nA: I did had this problem..

But while the problem is severe, I have some ideas that my GPU should work, and what I need is a set of sub-answers to my question here. This may seem tedious, but bear with me and try to answer some of my sub-questions, because what matters in my case is the little time that I have before the PC heats up and shuts down.  - I am still in Win 7 as I write the question here :(\nWhen I try to install Ubuntu on my laptop the cooler goes crazy because the machine heats up, and I imagine that it's the GPU: so hot that the laptop shuts down in emergency because of the high temperature. I should give up the idea of a dual boot on this computer, but from time to time I come back to give it another try, especially that now it is the first time that I am looking for assistance on solving this.\nThe computer that I am talking about is the one presented here, a hp pavilion g7-1246ef. It is a 64-bit system that is running perfectly Windows 7, which excludes hardware causes. \nThe GPU is an ATI Dynamic Switchable Graphics ('dual'), presented here. That is, I have two graphics cards, one integrated (Intel) and one ATI/Radeon 6470M. In Windows they look like so:\n\nLooking at the list of supported hardware, I see a 6470. \nIs that the same as my 6470M?\nMy idea is that this happens because of the missing drivers for the GPU, or maybe not missing, but not working properly.\nThe issue of installing this type of drivers is often discussed. For example in this detailed answer, which explains how to install the fglrx packages supplied by Ubuntu and also how to install official ATI binaries from the ATI site.\nSuch answer is about the ATI GPU.\n- Considering ATI: isn't there a driver already installed when installing Ubuntu?\n- Considering Intel and the fact that I have dual graphics: if the ATI driver is missing and has to be installed, isn't that the case for the Intel too? Or is it just the ATI driver missing?\n- Considering both: is it possible that the native support for this GPU (the one experienced during install and immediately after) be so low that the computer shuts down in emergency, or must there be another issue involved? (none present in Windows though, nor in ...BIOS!)\nTo a different question I got an answer saying: You could just ignore this until things are \"better\" (14.04 should give you a better base) but until then your ATI card is going to be running at full power.\nThat makes me think that ATI running at full power is causing the heating and the crash, and that I should deal with the problem of the ATI drivers, while leaving the Intel issue aside. \nIs this correct?\nHere there is an answer on a dual GPU with the same 6470M card as mine. What it says is:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu built-in \"radeon\" driver does NOT support \"dual graphics\". - Is this still true in 14.04?\n\n*Best install the latest AMD Catalyst driver.  - I have found that on the AMD site. - Although sometimes the machine shuts down because of the heat before ending even the OS installation, if I get the chance I should install that, I think. In Windows, the package looks like so:\n\nWould the installation start by double clicking the .run file?\n\nA: The best answer is: install a newer version of Ubuntu, with a recent kernel. \nXubuntu 14.04 works great on that computer, and the GPU is never too hot.\nAs this answer explains, \"New kernel 3.13 has an advanced dynamic power management of the ATI card with the radeon driver.\n\nAlso, \"In normal conditions the ATI discrete is off.\" \n(When the cooler gets up now, in most cases it is not because of the GPU, but of the CPU.)\n(The best way of monitoring GPU temperature in Xubuntu 14.04 when using the OpenSource driver.) \n\nSub-answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is ATI Radeon 6470M supported? YES.\n\n*Considering ATI: is there a driver already installed when installing Ubuntu? YES. It's the opensource Radeon driver just mentioned\nGL_RENDERER   = Gallium 0.4 on AMD CAICOS\nGL_VERSION    = 3.0 Mesa 10.1.3\nGL_VENDOR     = X.Org\n\n*Considering Intel card: that is the one that is mostly used (and had been already supported) while under normal conditions the ATI stays discrete (in contrast with older versions of the kernel when it was abnormally used at full capacity and was getting hot).\n\n*So, is there an \"ATI issue\" for this machine? NO, as far as I am concerned, as I do not use possible video intensive features that might involve the need for the proprietary driver.\n\nThe comments and answers of the user Rmano were very useful to me in understanding what the problem was and in articulating this answer.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu server using Network Console I have a bit of a weird situation, I have a laptop (an old Macbook 3,1) with a half broken screen.

I am learning Japanese and I have a problem with the default font used by Ubuntu. I would like to learn the standard kanji writing and not a fancy or smart way of writing them...\nI already had a similar problem before with the 12.04. I was able to solve it with the solution in this post: Showing the correct font in Japanese, i.e., installing the package ttf-vlgothic.\nSince I upgrade to the 14.04, I noticed again that some characters are not correct, but it is not as obvious as before. The solution presented before (sudo apt-get install ttf-vlgothic) does not work anymore because ttf-vlgothic was removed from the sources of the 14.04 (why?)... Apparently, Ubuntu 14.04 uses fonts-vlgothic by default, but some new characters are wrongly written. For example, the kanji 究 is supposed to be written with its 5th stroke being \"square\" as it is shown in http://jiten.go-kanken.com/kanji/272.html, but by default in Ubuntu the 5th stroke is straight, a little like the 4th. \nWhy was ttf-vlgothic removed? Is it a bug? And also, ttf-vlgothic should be used by default, as it is the one corresponding to the current standard in Japan. (Should I report a bug?)\nAnyway, does someone have a solution? Thanks!\nEdit: what I said about fonts-vlgothic is wrong, I removed this package and replaced it with a standard font, and I still have the problem, so it's another package/font???\n\nA: I'm having the same problem here.  Ubuntu 14.04 shows Chinese fonts over Japanese fonts by default, English language environment.\nYou can fix this by following steps, but this modifies your entire environment into Japanese.  It means the name of applications, folders, etc. are written in Japanese. \n\n\n*\n\n*System Setting -> Language Support\n\n*Insttall/Remove Languages -> check Japanese -> Apply\n\n*System Setting -> User Account -> Select Japanese as your Language\n\n\nI'd like to change only fonts, but I don't know how to do it unfortunately.\n\nA: I think I've found right answer.\nEasiest way to show Japanese fonts under Ubuntu 14.04 is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy 69-language-selector-ja-jp.conf to your ~/.fonts.conf or ~/.config/font-manager/local.conf.\n\n\nThat's it.  Easy, isn't it? ;)\nDetailed expressions are below:\nFirst, there are mechanisms to show Japanese fonts including vlgothic fonts under /etc/fonts/conf.d/ (or /etc/fonts/conf.avail/).  Those are written in 65-fonts-xxx.conf files.  However those mechanisms are only available in Japanese environment.  For example, you can see following lines in those configuration files.  This restricts it.\n\n<test name=\"lang\" compare=\"contains\">\n    <string>ja</string>\n  </test>\n\nOn the other hand, similar mechanisms for Chinese fonts are available in 69-language-selector-xxx files.  Those mechanisms are not checking language environment, so those are available whenever.  I don't know why there is no 69-language-selector-ja-jp.conf in Ubuntu 14, but it is a reason why Chinese fonts are shown under English environment.\nYou can remove above language checks from 65-fonts-xxx.conf files to show Japanese fonts if you want.  Or, you can modify only your configuration file like described at the top.\n", "Q: monitor goes blank opening google chrome download page Now this is trully a esoteric problem.\nI have a Dell Vostro 1710 and freshly installed ubuntu 14.04.1\nWhenever I try to open google.com/chrome monitor turns off.

In Psensor window now there is a new entry, and it's for radeon, but it's always zero.\n\nEditing the names so as to display the chip name, it looks like so:\n\nsensors command gives the same info as above.\nEDIT3\nAlso:\n~$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n[sudo] password for cip: \n0:IGD:+:Pwr:0000:00:02.0\n1:DIS: :DynOff:0000:01:00.0\n\n\nEDIT4:\n~$ xrandr --setprovideroffloadsink 0x6c 0x44 X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  140 (RANDR)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  34 ()\n  Value in failed request:  0x6c\n  Serial number of failed request:  17\n  Current serial number in output stream:  18\n\n\nA: I use xfce4-sensors-plugin: \n\nIt needs lm-sensors installed and configured, and it is in the standard (universe) repository.\nThe ATI sensor (when used with the radeon open source driver) should be called something like radeon-pci-0100 --- Notice however that with recent kernels the card is kept off when not used, so the sensor is not read in that conditions --- see https://askubuntu.com/a/469439/16395 \nYou can check if the sensors are working activating the offloading as explained in this post: http://xpressrazor.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/enable-and-use-open-source-radeon-drivers-in-a-muxless-hybrid-graphics-intelamd-setup/:\n\n\n*\n\n*List the graphic providers: \nxrandr --listproviders\n\nmake a note of the id hexadecimal codes \n\n*Activate them: \nxrandr --setprovideroffloadsink 0x53 0x79 \n\n(you have to substitute the codes of the Intel and ATI providers, in that order) \n\n*Open a terminal window and run \nDRI_PRIME=1 glxgears -info \n\nNow using sensors in another window you should see the temperature reading of the radeon card going up. \n\nA: After doing all those actions that are presented in the question and also after updating Psensor to version 1.1.2 the Radeon temperature appeared there after reboot.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jfi/psensor-unstable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install psensor\n\nMore here: Psensor Updated With Option To Display Temperature Sensors On The Panel.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe radeon info appeared in Psensor only after reboot if set to launch on startup. Also, it is odd that if Psensor is closed and restarted without reboot, the radeon entry is absent again.\nIn fact the ATI card is not working at that moment as this answer explains: New kernel 3.13 has an advanced dynamic power management of the ATI card with the radeon driver. In normal conditions the ATI discrete is off.\nBoth Psensor and Xfce Sensor plugin will display the radeon temperature at startup if they are open but if they are restarted the entry will be missing in Psensor, will be zero in the Xfce panel plugin and will be N/A when running sensors.\nTo test this, and start the ATI card, that answer says to run glxgears:\nDRI_PRIME=1 glxgears -info\n\n\nWhat happens then is that the Xfce panel plugin will show the GPU temperature, while psensor will not until restarted. sensors command will display the temperature of the ATI card.\nIf glxgears is shut down, the discrete card will stop. Then, Psensor will continue to show the last GPU temperature until restarted. The panel plugin too, but not for long. In its properties, radeon temp is already zero, uncheck and recheck to refresh.\n\nA: Wrote a small python script which could be used in your XFCE panel to monitor the GPU temp, Utilization, Fan speed, Memory and Power based on gpustat https://github.com/wookayin/gpustat.\nYou can check it out in my repository\nhttps://github.com/Paptop/XfceGpuPanelMonitor\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10: cannot find 25_custom in /etc/grub.d I am following the following tutorial: Dual boot Surface Pro with Ubuntu?\nWhen I want to create my custom bootloader I need to edit a grub script (among other ones) called 25_custom. But it's not there, I checked it with cd / <enter> sudo find iname \"25_custom\"\nI tried to see if the contents of 25_custom where somewhere else, so I used grep -rnw . -e 'bkpbootx64.efi'. The string is tied to the Windows efi file. The only thing that grep returned where the results from the (downloaded) tutorial on my hard disk.\nI could create the file by myself, and copy/paste what the tutorial says about it, but I don't know if that would work. I'm a bit scared to do it, because a previous mistake led me to try to repair my Surface for 10 hours.\nSo could someone explain what is going on?\nEdit: it seems 25_custom is created by boot repair, which is not needed to use in 14.10. So now I'm wondering where I'd need to place the code of 25_custom, if at all.\nNote: the tutorial about the theming part is only on Github\n\nA: So it seemed that Boot Repair is creating the 25_custom file. This file does not get created when installing 14.10, so in order to create the boot theme, a small change to the tutorial needs to be made.\nAfter some testing I found out how to fix it by grepping on the string \"class windows\"\nIt showed that in etc/grub.d/30_os-prober are two entries with the string class windows. If you change the second one (which also has osprober-efi as a string that the other doesn't), then you'll change the boot title of windows. It used to show up as \"Windows Boot Manager\" and I changed it to \"Windows\". Here is what I actually replaced in the 30_os-prober file.\nIt used to be: '$(echo \"${LONGNAME} $onstr\" | grub_quote)'\nI replaced it as: '$(echo \"Windows\" | grub_quote)'\n", "Q: How can I group applications in one launcher icon?

I'd rather leave wifi unconnected all the time, but have the option of turning it back on whenever I want, which means leaving the network password saved, but disabling wifi.  At the moment, I can go to the network menu in the dock and uncheck Enable Wifi.\nThe problem is that after restarting, and sometimes just after the computer has been on for a while, that option simply re-enables itself and I get a wifi connection message.  \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I get that option to persist?  \n\n*Why does it switch back to its default all the time?\n\n\nI did have a script that force restarted networking on wake to get rid of another issue.

It is not a piece of software that you actually need but full access to all relevant log files for your operating system.\nIf it is an application that you want rather than manually check log files you can install Activity Log Manager, a graphical user interface which lets you control what gets logged by Zeitgeist.

C: which has Win7 installed on it and D: which has most of my documents (movie files, docs, dropbox folder etc).\nRecently, Windows became really slow and a friend suggested formatting C: and installing Ubuntu instead.\nI don't mind doing it on C: but I don't wanna touch D:\nCan I install Ubuntu on C: and still access all the files in D?\nPlease note that my videos folder should be shareable to other computers around the house (with Win7 or Win8) and also I would like to install Plex Server on Ubuntu that will have access to those files.\nThank you!\n\nA: Yes you can, since Ubuntu easily accesses NTFS.\nYou can go ahead and install Ubuntu on C: partition and then you can set Ubuntu to automatically mount D: partition on boot. Just follow this post: \nHow to automount NTFS partitions?\n\nA: Before removing or changing partitions, or before installing any new OS it is vital to perform a backup of your valuable data. Even if you did it all correctly there is an inherent risk of data loss.\nBecause you are not yet familiar with Ubuntu you may want to keep your Windows installation for \"just in case\". This can be done from a dual boot installation of Ubuntu \"alongside\" of Windows where you can choose on boot whether you wish to run Windows or Ubuntu. See\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu?\nYou can always remove your Windows later in case you don't need it any longer.\nIn a dual boot setup your will be able to read and write all of your data on drive/partition D: from both, Windows, and Ubuntu.\nOnly in case you really really want to get rid of Windows you may proceed and install Ubuntu on your C: partition. To avoid data loss please take extra care to not install the default (this will replace all your data on your drive) but choose \"Do something else\" instead. You will then be able to delete, and create partitions manually. Only if you did not touch or format the partitions that holds your data you will be able to access it from Ubuntu.\n\nIf in doubt: do not proceed - ask somebody.\n\n\nA: That's doable, however, if you do not want to reformat drive \"D:\", you'll probably run into problems as it most certainly was formatted using NTFS, then by default Ubuntu will not write to that drive. It is not safe to turn on the write feature on NTFS from Linux because all the information about the disk format is not known by the developers of the NTFS system under Linux.\nIf you have enough room on C: to copy all the data on D:, then you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy the data from D: to C:\n\n*boot under Linux from a CD\n\n*format D: using xfs4 or similar\n\n*copy the data from C: back to \"D:\" (now under Linux it is a mount point such as /data)\n\n\nIf C: is too small to copy D:, then the best would probably to buy another hard drive and format that one with xfs4, copy D: to it, then install Linux on \"C:\" and you should then have all the data readily available. Once that is the case, you could format \"D:\" and use it too for backups or something.\nNow, to share the files with other MS-Windows boxes, you want to install Samba. That's enough and it does not require you to have a disk formatted with NTFS. Samba is relatively simple if you do not need super high level of security. Just make sure the Linux firewall is not in the way. You should search references and such about Samba so find out how to get it working.\n", "Q: Find a file which contains a string and delete it in Ubuntu My CMS is full of SPAM scripts and they are almost in every folder. I figured out, that I can find those scripts by using this find/grep command:\nsudo find . -type f \\( -name '*.php' -or -name '*.node' \\) -exec grep -i \"eval(base64_decode\" {} +\n\nWell some of the files just contain the spam-script and they are between 300 - 302 Bytes.\nBut some other files, which are been used by the CMS, are also infected.

There are hundreds of files and I don't wanna do this by my own.\nThanks a lot in advanced!\n\nA: You can try the following command which will call a perl find/replace command for every file matching the \"eval(base64_decode\" pattern:\nsudo find . -type f \\( -name '*.php' -or -name '*.node' \\) -exec grep -li \"eval(base64_decode\" {} \\; 2>/dev/null | xargs perl -i -p0e 's/<\\?php.*?\\?>//s'\n\nThe perl part will just remove the first <?php ?> block in the files returned by the find command.\n", "Q: Remotely connect Ubuntu to windows over internet how to remotely connect to another computer over the internet window,can I do it by Remmina Remote desktop client?Can anyone tell me a way out.I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and the remote desktop is running on WIndows 8\n\nA: You can use TeamViewer: http://www.teamviewer.com/\nIt's very easy to install in any Operating System and very easy to connect (you just need to introduce the ID and PIN of the computer you want to control).\n\nA: Yes you can use \nRemmina Remote desktop client\nIts one of many available, and you do not need 3rd party software like Team Viewer.\nOther apps for that that you can use on ubuntu are:\nRemotedesktop Client,2X Client RDP / Remote Desktop\n\nyou can also use rdesktop from terminal\nWith any of those you do not need anything installed on the windows machine\n", "Q: Thunar custom action to open terminal as root How to edit the custom action that would open a root Terminal in a given folder?\nHere it says to use gksu terminal\n\nhere to add gksu “xfce4-terminal –default-working-directory=%f”\nBut they don't work in Xubuntu 12.04, Thunar 1.6.3.\n\nA: The good command is gksu xfce4-terminal\n\n", "Q: How to fix the following error during an update?

For this purpose, I created this ~/.config/upstart/touchpad.conf upstart job:\nstart on desktop-start\n\nscript\n    mouse_state_old=-1\n    touchpad_id=\"$(xinput list | grep -i touchpad | grep -oP \"\\bid\\s*=\\s*\\K\\d+\")\"\n\n    while true ; do\n        mouse_state=\"$(xinput list | grep -ci mouse)\"\n        \n        if [ \"$mouse_state\" -ne \"$mouse_state_old\" ] ; then\n            if [ \"$mouse_state\" -gt 0 ] ; then\n                killall syndaemon\n                xinput disable \"$touchpad_id\"\n            else\n                xinput enable \"$touchpad_id\"\n                syndaemon -m 100 -i 1 -k -d\n            fi\n        fi\n        \n        mouse_state_old=\"$mouse_state\"\n        sleep 3\n    done\nend script\n\nThis job works, but only after I log into the OS. I want the touchpad disabled also before I log in, at login screen.\n\nINFOS NO MORE NEEDED AND SIMPLY WRONG:\naccording to the cookbook, it seems that lightdm does not emit the correct event. If I run manually\n/sbin/initctl -q emit login-session-start DISPLAY_MANAGER=lightdm\n\nthe upstart script is invoked. So I created a /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/90-upstart_login.conf conf file with\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-setup-script=/home/marco/.local/usr/bin/all/upstart_login.sh\n\nand the /home/marco/.local/usr/bin/all/upstart_login.sh script with\n#!/bin/sh\n\n/sbin/initctl -q emit login-session-start DISPLAY_MANAGER=lightdm\n\nIt works if invoked manually from bash but not at boot.\nI have lightdm version 1.10.1-0ubuntu1, so it should emit the event.\n\nA: You are mixing up system and session jobs and events. lightdm emits the event just fine, but to the system instance of Upstart. Copy your ~/.config/upstart/touchpad.conf to /etc/init/ and change the start on event to login-session-start.\n\nA: Instead of using Upstart, you can try to place your script snippet into /etc/X11/session.d/.\nMake sure that it is by the name of 99local and that it does not have a #!bin/sh header.\nIt also should not be executable.\nThis will ensure that your script is run after the xsession is set up and that it always runs, since the scripts in that directory are always run when an X server is started.\n", "Q: How to install gloobus preview in ubuntu 14.04 I switched to ubuntu 14.04 and want quick preview.

For Ubuntu 20.04 1 LTS. I had two NICs and I only wanted to use one of them to vend IPs via dhcp to clients on a LAN.\nMy fix was a combination of things as shown below.  However I belive the real fix was the addition of interface to /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf\n/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf\nwas (broken):\n\ndefault-lease-time 600;\nmax-lease-time 7200;\nddns-update-style none;\nauthoritative;\n\nsubnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\n   range 192.168.0.2 192.168.0.99;\n   option routers 192.168.0.1;\n   option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\n   option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1, 8.8.8.8;\n}\n\n\nchanged to (added interface and it worked):\n\ndefault-lease-time 600;\nmax-lease-time 7200;\nddns-update-style none;\nauthoritative;\n\nsubnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\n   interface enp6s0;\n   range 192.168.0.2 192.168.0.99;\n   option routers 192.168.0.1;\n   option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\n   option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1, 8.8.8.8;\n}\n\nIn hacking around I also changed the following, but not sure now I needed to.

I found that I was starting the isc-dhcp-server6.service(IPV6), instead of isc-dhcp-server.service(IPV4). My configuration files were defined for ipv4 only. Hence I was getting \"Not configured to listen on any interface\" when I tried to do \"systemctl start isc-dhcp-server6.service\".\n\nA: I had this issue as well.  Dhcpd was starting before the network interface was ready.  You can add this to your /etc/init/isc-dhcp-server.conf file (for IPv4).\nNear the bottom of the file you will see a line like this (the \"exec\" is what you are looking for):\nexec dhcpd -user dhcpd -group dhcpd -f -q -4 -pf /run/dhcp-server/dhcpd.pid -cf $CONFIG_FILE $INTERFACES\n\nAdd this to the line above it\nsleep 30\n\nThis will delay the start of your dhcpd server.

This allowed the service to start without error.\n\nA: http://www.braindisconnect.com/wiki/index.php?title=Linux_DHCP_Server\nThis message has nothing to do with your dhcpd.conf file or configuration.\nThe error is because dhcpd is interpreting the /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf as an interface.\nThe 20 is the character count of \"/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf\" and not the file contents.\nAdd the -cf to your syntax and so that config file is actually getting tested or just use dhcpd -t.\n", "Q: Touchpad 2 finger scroll ends with a right click, text marking lag Some recent update made my two-finger scrolling unbearable.

Why? I was happy with my onboard graphics but I wanted to be able to run some games in this machine from time to time, so I bought a GT630 1GB DDR3 VRAM. When I boot into Windows everything is fine, gaming performance improved considerably. Consider this is a cheap card but still far better than my onboard GPU.\nNow the problem is when I'm working in Ubuntu. From the start I noticed a suspicious behavior of the Unity Launcher. It's easy to tell that the launcher animation is dropping frames (animation with my onboard GPU was very soft). The most bothersome thing is that Flash Player based video players, including Youtube, are dropping a lot of frames, easy to detect by eye. My onboard GPU played them fine when in Linux, including 1080p content.\nDriver: Gallium 0.4 on NVC1\nUbuntu 14.04 64 bits\nWhen possible I prefer to accept the drivers the OS loads by default for a given device. I'm not expecting the same performance I get in Windows but less performance than with my onboard GPU has no sense.\n\nA: While using the proprietary driver (as indicated in Hatoru's response) will definitely increase the performance, it will also increase the energy consumption (and therefore decrease the battery life).\nSo, if you want to get maximum performance for applications that require it, and maximise the battery life for the rest, the only option as of now is to use the proprietary driver (as indicated by Hatoru) in combination with Bumblebee. Installation instructions are detailed in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee#Installation:\nEnable the Universe and Multiverse repositories - you need to do this to allow the bumblebee and nvidia packages respectively to be installed.\nInstall the Nvidia proprietary driver (in this case 319, you should use the latest one available for your hardware in the Ubuntu repositories):\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-319-updates nvidia-settings-319-updates\n\nInstall Bumblebee:\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia primus linux-headers-generic\n\nConfigure Bumblebee, editing /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf:\nDriver=nvidia\nKernelDriver=nvidia-319-updates\nLibraryPath=/usr/lib/nvidia-319-updates:/usr/lib32/nvidia-319-updates\nXorgModulePath=/usr/lib/nvidia-319-updates/xorg,/usr/lib/xorg/modules\n\nThen restart, and you are ready to run programs using the Nvidia card with:\noptirun command\n\n\nA: I took courage and I installed the closed source drivers from NVidia. I used the Additional Drivers dialog to do it. This may provide a bit outdated driver than the one downloaded from the NVidia site but Its installation is totally automatic, you just need to watch the progress bar for a while and then restart the system.\nI have to say that the performance gain is noticeable from the start. Even the Unity launcher animation is very soft, and my problem with Flash player is now solved. The only thing is that you have to use a closed source driver but just this once I gave It a try. As the contrast in performance to my onboard GPU with Its default drivers is so noticeable I could not accept that dedicated graphics perform worse than onboard graphics.\nThen the answer to this question is: the graphics performance can be improved by using NVidia closed source drivers. They are not enabled by default by obvious reasons.\n", "Q: How can I setup a remote desktop connection? My desktop is more powerful than my laptop, and thus I would like to be able to remotely use my desktop from another computer. I am using Ubuntu 14.04 on the laptop and mint 17 on the desktop.

Basically I will plus a flash drive into the board click on the script. The script will then copy/move some files to replace old ones that are out of date.  An example of this would be me replacing the /etc/apt/sources.list with a new one for different repositories.  Is it better to copy or move a file to this location to replace it?  I will also be installing apache2 in this script then moving over directories to the www and cgi-bin.  Is it better to copy or move directories?  I will also be changing permissions.\nBasically my question is, is it better to move mv or copy cp files and directories when dealing with bash scripting?\n\nA: Move if you only need it in the target path, copy if you need it in both locations. There's no inherent \"insecurity\" to mv or cp, and you'll be needlessly adding complexity (and extremely likely bugs) to your scripts if you start trying to implement your own mv.\nFor special cases there may be more suitable tools than either. For example, if you want to change owner or mode when copying there's the install tool which does that in one line rather than three.\n\nA: It depends. In certain (usually rare) situations you should cp the file to a temporary name on the target filesystem, then mv it to it's final name, as the mv operation is atomic on a journaled file system.  If there is any chance the application will try to read this file while you are replacing it, do this.\nYou specified that you are transferring the file from a different filesystem (flash drive).  In this case mv is doing an implicit cp && rm.  If you go back 20+ years mv didn't even support this, but there is no reason to be stuck in history.  \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 with Nvidia driver - blank screen after kernel update I have a Ubuntu 14.04 system on which I installed the 64-bit Nvidia driver (version 343.22) from their website.

There is a PPA for latest Nvidia drivers if needed: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/ubuntu/x-updates\n\nA: Yes, I believe you can install dkms and the headers before you run the installer and it should give you a DKMS option during setup.

I have a computer maintenance class in school where we installed Windows XP and we had to search for drivers. It is tiring and iI still haven't found all of them. My question was that do i need to search for drivers after installing ubuntu too or is this driver thing just for windows. \nI am new to this stuff so would appreciate any help.d\n\nA: Whether you need to install drivers or not, depends on the specific hardware components used in the machine. This is the same both on Ubuntu and Windows.\nHowever, Ubuntu uses the concept of Generic Drivers, drivers which are made to fit a large range of hardware components. E.g. the open-source nVidia driver installed by default, noveau, supports most of nVidia's graphics cards. However, you may experience a lack of support for certain features of some devices, like the nVidia Optimus technology. If you want to use this, you have to install a specific driver, as an example nvidia-prime, a nVidia-proprietary driver for Optimus support on Linux.\nI've also seen Windows use this concept, but never to the extent Ubuntu does. As far as my experience goes, the drivers preinstalled on Ubuntu cover up most of the not too new devices out there, save for a few exceptions.\nAs an example, I once had a Toshiba laptop which I wiped and reinstalled Windows 7. The graphics worked, but only 4:3 on a 16:9 screen. But there it stopped - nearly no device in this laptop had its driver preinstalled in Windows 7, not even a Ethernet driver, so I couldn't download them.\nWhen I installed Ubuntu, everything worked out of the box. However, the ethernet was a bit slow, so I installed a specific driver from the manufacturer of the Ethernet card and had better surf speed after.\n\nTo see, whether you will actually have to install additional drivers, you can boot Ubuntu directly from a DVD or USB stick. The system will run, as if it was installed on the computer (except it will be a bit slower when run from USB or DVD). You can play with everything and see what works and what doesn't. If something doesn't work (well) you can be almost sure that somewhere out there either some company or some free devs created a working driver for the device.\nKnown proprietary drivers can be installed using the Software & Updates utility, in the tab Additional Drivers. Many open source drivers can be installed from the official repositories. And if you don't find them there, you may stumble over a PPA, DEB/DKMS package, to install or even source code to compile the driver directly on your machine.\n\nTo actually find out the name of devices you need or want a driver for (if you didn't find it in Additional Drivers), use the commands sudo lshw and lspci.\nlshw creates a detailed report, including name and vendor, if detected, on basically any hardware in the computer. If you install the package lshw-gtk, all this information will become much more readable in a GUI. If there is no driver at all installed for the device you're searching for, you'll most likely find the tag UNCLAIMED. So this is a good place to start.\nlspci lists all devices connected to a PCI bus. This includes Network Controllers, Graphics Cards, Audio and Video devices (Screen, Speaker), USB Controllers, and so on... Most of them are listed with a name, however mostly a generic one.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 on yoga 2 pro I am using a Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro with an i7 processor. The Ubuntu download says that it's for AMD64. Will Ubuntu 14.04 work on my device?\n\nA: Yes, the AMD64 ISO of Ubuntu 14.04 will work, since your computer's processor is 64bit.\n", "Q: Xfce on Xubuntu issues with WINE I am having a heck of a time getting WINE to work correctly in Xfce on Xubuntu.  I need to use Photoshop CS, thus need to use WINE, but VM's are not an option as it's a pain to manage files back and forth, it's also slower.\nBut, the problem I am having is, in Gnome 2, MATE, and Unity, Photoshop CS works just great.  Nearly perfect actually.  But in Xfce, I can not get the interface to respond like it's supposed to.  I recorded a video showing how it's behaving.  Mind you, this happens with either a compositor (doesn't matter which one), or even WITHOUT a compositor.  I am very stern that I have tried with ZERO compositor because on Xfce's own forum, they keep bringing up a compositor as the problem, but I have definitely verified that no compositor is loaded, either it be Compiz, Compton, or Xfce's own (Xrender?).\nHere's the video showing what problem I am getting here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJGxIDHgfrc\nI really could appreciate some help.  In fact, if anyone also has Xubuntu 14.04, and has Photoshop CS, please try it on it and see if you get the same problem too.  I need to have this working as I am not about to fiddle with multiple desktop environments or VM's.  I shouldn't have to, it should all work in one DE.\n\nA: The culprit is xfwm4, it makes the menu bar of some wine apps inaccessible.\nReplace xfwm4 with, for example, openbox and the problem is gone. \n", "Q: mplayer configure Error: libavutil/x86/asm.h header is required for shared FFmpeg In Ubuntu 14.04,I run ./configure --enable-gui --enable-xvid-lavc --enable-xv --enable-alsa to install mplayer,when it comes to Checking for FFmpeg .... then the error shows up.

I can't find how to change it in settings.\n\n\n\nA: The simple answer is, you can't.\nThere isn't anything relevant to be changed in the Settings Manager or Settings Editor, assuming that you are using Xubuntu release that still uses Xfce 4.10 or earlier (Xubuntu 14.04 or older).\nThe long answer is, you can get it with some efforts.\nThere are two known ways to achieve this, based on the clues left in the answer given in the similar question that is linked in comment above.\n\n\n*\n\n*Modify the source code of xfwm4 according to this forum post and recompile it\n\n*Upgrade your existing Xfce to version 4.12, either by:\na. using Xubuntu Dev PPA (deprecated) to upgrade\nb. downloading stable packages, compile and install manually\nc. upgrading to Xubuntu 15.04 that also comes with Xfce 4.12\nIf you are using Xubuntu 14.04 or 14.10, the easiest method is probably method 2a, using PPA to upgrade. However, it has been noted as \"with no guarantee of functionality or support\". Several known issues can be read from this article.\nAbove all, I have compiled the resources into this single answer for convenience and it is for you to decide whichever method you prefer to achive \"maximize window on snap-up\" feature.\n\nAnswerer's note: This answer was relevant at time of posting, but is now deprecated. The newer releases of Xubuntu does maximize window as expected and this is no longer an issue.\n\nA: The answer by clearkimura is an excellent one. However, I resolved this by going to Window Manager Tweaks and deselecting 'Automatically tile windows..' I use three monitors. When I drag a maximized window to a new screen, I noticed it will fill the window when I drag cursor to the top. Otherwise, I double click the window header to maximize. Then if I want to tile left and right I set a keyboard shortcut under Window Manager Tweaks > Keyboard > Tile window. I ended up being fine with this setup. It probably makes a big difference too that I have multiple monitors. I may not be as content with this if I just had one monitor. The only exception to this I've noticed is that Chrome (not Chromium) does not maximize in this way. I have used Xfce 4.12 on Fedora 22 and on Xubuntu 15.04, and it has worked well. However, I don't know how well it would work on 14.04.   \n\nA: This is the third thread I'm answering this question on tonight, but I searched long for the solution so I feel like sharing. I'm on Xubuntu 14.04.  \nI installed Kwin, the window manager from KDE desktop. Everything works perfectly and windows tile to sides, corners, and maximize when dragged to the top. Do: \nsudo apt-get install kde-window-manager\n\nTry it with kwin --replace. Then go to settings manager > Session and startup > Applicaiton Autostart > +Add\nInput whatever in the first two fields and in the last one put\nkwin --replace\n\nSave and log out and in again. Now you have the expected window tiling and OpenGL acceleration giving less tearing. You will get new window decorations. To change window manager settings, you can right click the title bar and choose More actions > window manager settings.

Multitouch seems to be working fine on Chromium out of the box, but not on Firefox. On Chromium, dragging a finger up or down the screen scrolls the screen as expected, but on Firefox, that gesture seems to be highlighting text. How can I get Firefox to play nice with multitouch gestures? \nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on a Lenovo Yoga 2 11\" convertible laptop. \nEdit: I read the page here which says that touch capability is present but disabled in FF. But enabling them and restarting doesn't seem to have any effect--dragging one's finger across the screen still only selects text. \n\nA: Firefox doesn't yet support multitouch on X11/Linux. At present, work is underway on upgrading from GTK+ 2 to GTK+ 3 which I believe has landed in Nightly and Aurora/Developer Edition. There's a bug tracking the GTK upgrade as well as a bug for touch event support. The overall bug for multitouch support on Linux appears to be 711711 which depends on the bugs mentioned above.\n\nA: \"Grab and drag\" extension for Firefox did the trick for me, allowing at least for scrolling without selecting text. \nGestures, however, do not seem to work.\n\nA: On Xubuntu 16.04 with Firefox 50, I got it working by enabling e10s and setting the env-var MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1. In detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable e10s/Multiprocess. If you're running Firefox 57 or higher, it should be enabled already. Otherwise, you may have to disable a bunch of addons, and possibly force enable it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-on-compatibility-reporter/ to check which addons are incompatible with e10s, although simply having only-marked-as-compatible addons is not enough in FF50 to get e10s switched on, you may have to force-enable it anyway (in FF50, only certain whitelisted addons are allowed with e10s by default – later versions will enable e10s as long as all addons are compatible). \n\n*You can check in about:support if Multiprocess is on. If you need to force-enable, just open about:config, right-click and enter a new boolean value with the name browser.tabs.remote.force-enable; then restart FF and check about:support again.\n\n\n*Exit FF, and start it from the command-line with MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1 /usr/bin/firefox.\nNow you can test https://www.paulirish.com/demo/multi and scroll with one finger.\nSource: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1091627\n\nA: I believe this is an issue with Firefox itself, as it does it on various OS's, and on various hardware. I know how to get it work on a MacBook multi-touch touchpad running Ubuntu, so I'll show you how to do it there, and you should be able to get it to work on your touch screen as well, as it's a setting within Firefox, not the system.\nOk, open Firefox, and enter about:config in the address bar, then in the filter box, put browser.gesture, that will bring up all the touch gestures for Firefox. Once you have the touch settings showing, look for browser.gesture.pinch.in and set the value to cmd_fullZoomReduce, that should give you the zoom out, and to get the zoom in, look for browser.gesture.pinch.out and set that value to cmd_fullZoomEnlarge. Once you have those values set, there are 2 more settings you have to change. The next one you want to look for is browser.gesture.pinch.latched by default it's set to true you want to change that to false, then go to browser.gesture.pinch.threshold, which is set to 150 by default, you want to change that value to 10.\nThat is how I got all the multi-touch features working for me, I hope it works for you as well, good luck.\n\nA: In the Firefox version in Ubuntu 18.04 it works out of the box:\n\n\n*\n\n*pinch-to-zoom with two fingers (a bit slow and unresponsive and you better use fingers of both hands)\n\n*scrolling with two-finger-tab and swipe up and down (also a bit unresponsive)\n\n*three-finger-tap gets the menu\n\n*dragging one's finger across the screen selects text\n\n\nThere seems no option to copy the selected text, but you can use Shift+F10 to get the menu and select copy there\n\nA: Only add this line at end of ~/.profile and restart your session.\nexport MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1\n\n", "Q: install ubuntu on google nexus10 without android I have a google nexus 10 that I deleted android from and installed ubuntu dev now I want to put read and write on it but the error msg is I don't have MTP so the computer won't talk to the tablet.\n\nA: To allow communication between your Nexus 10 and your host system you need to enable the developer mode on your device.\nGo to System Settings -> About this phone -> Developer mode:\n\nTo set the Writable Image, please follow this guide.\n", "Q: Hard Disk Full but Files size is about half the hard disk size My hard disk appears to be full.\nI have 239,4 GiB in the hard disk according to Filelight\nBut according to Gparted I only have 24,53 GiB free out of 463,79\nI tried some commands like:\napt-get clean\napt-get autoremove\n\nand also to use the application sweeper but I only gained some MiB\nWhat could be happening?\nThe system is Ubuntu 14.04 fully updated.\nThe output of df -h - as requested: \nFilesystem Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n\n/dev/sdb1 457G 432G 1,4G 100% / \nnone      4,0K 0    4,0K 0% /sys/fs/cgroup \nudev      978M 12K  978M 1% /dev \ntmpfs     198M 1,4M 197M 1% /run \nnone      5,0M 0    5,0M 0% /run/lock \nnone      988M 25M  964M 3% /run/shm\nnone      100M 60K  100M 1% /run/user \n\n\nA: I have got various users configured in the system, all of them administrators, and I have found that Filelight does not count files in other users' home directories. \nThe total size of the file system when exploring the root directory is 239,5 GiB from one user but 416,6 GiB from the other user.

First of all:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nThere is no tool that I am aware of that can read media files and then over-write the input straight away: you need to use an intermediate file. For a single file, you could do:\nffmpeg -i file.mp3 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k temp.mp3\nmv temp.mp3 file.mp3\n\nYou could combine these into a single line:\nffmpeg -i file.mp3 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k temp.mp3 && mv temp.mp3 file.mp3\n\nthe && there means that the mv command won't be executed unless ffmpeg exits with a status of 0 (which means success).\nTo check that what bit rate a file has, you can use ffprobe:\nffprobe -show_streams -select_streams a:0 -v quiet file.mp3 | grep -F 'bit_rate=320000'\n\n-show_streams tells ffprobe to show information about individual streams; -select_streams tells it which ones to select, and a:0 means 'the first audio stream (this is important for MP3 files in the case of cover art, which is stored as a video stream). The pipe (|) takes the standard output of ffprobe and feeds it to grep. grep will only print those lines that match a given pattern -- in this case, lines that contain the string bit_rate=320000. If you run this on a 320k kbps MP3, you'll get a line like this:\nbit_rate=32000\n\nIf you run it on anything with a different bit rate, you won't get any output at all; grep will fail to make a match, and will exit with a status of 1. This means that you can chain that command with the ffmpeg command:\nffprobe -show_streams -select_streams a:0 -v quiet file.mp3 | grep -F 'bit_rate=320000' && ffmpeg -i file.mp3 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k temp.mp3 && mv temp.mp3 file.mp3\n\nOr, a bit more readably:\nffprobe -show_streams -select_streams a:0 -v quiet file.mp3 | grep -F 'bit_rate=320000' &&\nffmpeg -i file.mp3 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k temp.mp3 &&\nmv temp.mp3 file.mp3\n\nThat will only act on 320 kbps MP3s. Try it with a couple of test files.\nThe next step is to get this working with multiple files. There are two standard ways of doing this: a for loop, and the find command. The following will act on every MP3 in a directory:\nfor f in *.mp3; do \nffprobe -show_streams -select_streams a:0 \"$f\" | grep -F 'bit_rate=320000' &&\nffmpeg -y -i \"$f\" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k /tmp/temp.mp3 && mv /tmp/temp.mp3 \"$f\"\ndone\n\nThis will not go into subdirectories; in order to do so, you have to set the globstar shell option:\nshopt -s globstar\nfor f in **/*.mp3; do\nffprobe -show_streams -select_streams a:0 \"$f\" | grep -F 'bit_rate=320000' &&\nffmpeg -y -i \"$f\" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k /tmp/temp.mp3 && mv /tmp/temp.mp3 \"$f\"\ndone\n\nWith find:\nfind . -name '*.mp3' -exec sh -c 'ffprobe -show_streams -select_streams a:0 \"$0\" | grep -F \"bit_rate=320000\" &&\nffmpeg -y -i \"$0\" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k /tmp/temp.mp3 && mv /tmp/temp.mp3 \"$0\"' '{}' \\;\n\nAll of these will run strictly sequentially -- they'll only convert one file at a time. Your processor is almost certainly capable of more than that, though; to speed things up, you could use GNU parallel:\nsudo apt-get install parallel\nshopt -s globstar\nparallel 'ffprobe -show_streams -select_streams a:0 {} | grep -F \"bit_rate=320000\" &&\nffmpeg -y -i {} -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k {.}.temp.mp3 && mv {.}.temp.mp3 {}' ::: **/*.mp3\n\nOr:\nfind . -name '*.mp3' | parallel 'ffprobe -show_streams -select_streams a:0 {} | grep -F \"bit_rate=320000\" &&\nffmpeg -y -i {} -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k {.}.temp.mp3 && mv {.}.temp.mp3 {}' \n\n", "Q: Change of RootFolder in .conf file has no effect - apache2.4 ubuntu 14.04 I have the impression that my changes in the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf does not result in any effect.\nI changed the document root from:\nDocumentRoot /var/www/html\nto\nDocumentRoot /var/www/html3\n(which does not exist) \nin the hope of getting a \"not found\" error in the web browser.

Is this possible Thanks. I want to delete windows but don't want to lose data on other partitions.\n\nA: Select something else\nthen click on the disk that you want to install ubuntu then change its mount point to \"/\" root. Format that partition with ext4. Thats it! complete the installation.\n\nA: You just have to select the manual partitioning method and tell the installer not to format any partition you want to use.\nHowever you'll have to create at least an empty linux(ext3/4) partition where to install Ubuntu (you can choose also to create another empty partition of about 2-3Gigs  as swap). You can re-partition your hard drive, using GParted livecd.\nUbuntu will also install grub2 for you, detecting your other Windows installation.\n\nA: You don't have to delete a partition to install ubuntu, you just need a couple empty partitions.  So in your case I would use Windows 7 Disk Management to shrink which ever partition has the most space on it and the result would be you would have unallocated space available.  Then use the Ubuntu installer and select \"Something else\" as the option on how to install.  And follow these instructions How to use manual partitioning during installation? starting under if you have windows heading step 5.  Since you already freed the space using windows.  \nThe only reason I suggest using windows to free the space is because the Ubuntu installer... for me... doesn't always work properly.  But feel free to just goto that link and follow the instructions under heading if you have windows starting from step 1 and skipping what I suggest here.\n\nA: in windows machine open disk manager,if partition tables shows unlocated space in disk u can use that space for ubuntu installation you can select \"something else\"option or \"setup manual partition\" while installing ubuntu.create \"/\" and \"swap\"partition (this 2  partition minimum requirement for installing ubuntu)  with unlocated space and proceed for installation. \n", "Q: How to create an mkv file from an mkv and an mka file from termial I have a bunch of mkv files, and an mka file for each one with the same name.

Am I missing something? Can anyone enlighten me as to why it outputs like this?\n\nA: You need to use sort before uniq:\nfind . -type f -exec md5sum {} ';' | sort | uniq -w 33\n\nuniq only removes repeated lines.  It does not re-order the lines looking for repeats.  sort does that part.\nThis is documented in man uniq:\n\nNote: uniq does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent.  You may want to sort the input first, or use sort -u without uniq.\n\n\nA: The input for uniq needs to be sorted. So for the example case, \nfind . -type f -exec md5sum '{}' ';' | sort | uniq -w 33\n\nwould work. The -w (--check-chars=N) makes the lines unique only regarding the first column; This option works for this case. but the possibilities to specify the relevant parts of the line for uniq are limited. For example, there are no options to specify working on some column 3 and 5, ignoring column 4.\nThe command sort has an option for unique output lines itself, and the lines are unique regarding the keys used for sorting. This means we can make use of the powerful key syntax of sort to define regarding which part the lines should be uniq.\nFor the example,\nfind . -type f -exec md5sum '{}' ';' | sort -k 1,1 -u\n\ngives just the same result, but the sort part is more flexible for other uses.\n\nA: The uniq command won't work unless input is buffered (e.g. using sort) or duplicated lines are next to each other. So find below few solutions.\nAWK\nHere is syntax for awk:\ncommand | awk '!a[$0]++{print}'\n\nFor repeated use, you can define the following shell alias:\nalias unicat='awk \"!a[\\$0]++{print}\"'\n\nthen run: command | unicat.\nParallel syntax (for quicker parsing):\ncommand | time parallel --block 100M --pipe awk '!a[\\$0]++{print}'\n\nTest command (100 lines filtered out of 200):\necho | pee \"seq 1 100\" \"seq 1 100\" | awk '!a[$0]++{print}' | wc -l\n\nPerl\nTry the following Perl script:\ncommand | perl -e 'while(<>){if(!$s{$_}){print $_;$|=1;$s{$_}=1;}}'\n\nShell alias syntax for repeated use:\nalias unicat='perl -e '\\''while(<>){if(!$s{$_}){print $_;$|=1;$s{$_}=1;}}'\\'''\n\nthen run: command | unicat.\nunique\nFor alternative to uniq, you can also use karrick's unique written in Go (it's using similar approach as above, but it's much faster and uses less memory than Perl/AWK solutions):\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/karrick/unique\nUsage:\ncommand | unique\n\nCons: When processing huge data, it's using a lot of memory, as it's hashing each item and adding it into array.\nWorkaround can be to have short lived instances per certain block size (if few duplicates are acceptable), e.g.\ncommand | parallel --block 100M -j 1 --pipe unique\n\nor using split (10M per chunk), e.g.\ncommand | split -b 10M --filter=\"unique\"\n\nquniq\nUse quniq utility to remove duplicated.

The dnsmasq part works fine.\nHowever on boot, dnsmasq runs BEFORE eth0 is up. This causes dnsmasq to not respond to queries on eth0. In syslog I can see dnsmasq start and about 3 seconds later eth0 comes up.\nIf i just restart dnsmasq all is fine.\nI have tried moving the order of dnsmasq around in rd2.d. I can get closer but it still runs first.\nIs there a way to force it to wait for eth0 to be up, or is there a way to force a 10 second delay before dnsmasq starts. Perhaps there is a script that I can run in rc2.d to stall the whole init process for a few seconds? (This is a server that is rarely down, I don't care if it takes a few extra seconds to restart)\n(as a side note: syslog also tells me that anything that needs DNS at boot time is also annoyed that dnsmasq is not running)\n\nA: I fixed this without changing the book order.

Regardless of that, I just wonder why it set a default swap value on a machine with no swap installed at all.\nWhy is this?

It has a number of spiritual successors in the form of open source editors that emulate it, but the most popular of these is vim, followed by nvi and elvis.\n\n\n*\n\n*vim is the most popular successor to vi, and adds many helpful features, many which you are used to and probably think of as being part of vi, but in reality are features added to vim.  vim aims for improved usability.\n\n*nvi is another editor that attempts to more closely emulate the original vi, but has since gone on to add many improvements.\n\n*elvis is another editor that attempts to closely emulate the original vi but add extra features.  elvis is the vi-like editor used by Slackware Linux.\n\n*busybox is a multi-purpose executable that includes a vi-like editor, but also includes a number of other command line tools.  It is designed for embedded systems and devices with very low memory or storage space.  Its vi-like editor is a vi clone optimised for very low size and memory use.\n\n*neovim is a fork of vim intended to implement some features vim is seen to lack.  It was once heralded as the new vim replacement but its growth has been slower than some hoped during initial enthusiasm about the project.\nThe reasons you're having problems is that you're trying to use vim commands in vim's \"vi compatibility mode\" which disables these features.\nI don't see any value in limiting yourself to just the commands that were in the original vi, as that editor is not really relevant anymore and you may as well benefit from the increased usability and functionality of vim or one of the other clones.\n\nA: Five years after putting this question, I use vim as my daily driver. \nIt doesn't matter vi/vim, you need to used to binding, and vim-style of working.

Ok, so in hind sight purging a package that was marked as a critical package was probably a terrible idea, but I was only following the instructions of people from this thread.\nI couldn't get default-jre to install (it complained about broken packages), so after a bit of googling I came across the article above. I typed the command sudo apt-get remove --purge tzdata and hit enter. Then it warned me tzdata was a critical package. I hesitated, obviously, and tried to find more information on the package but could find almost nothing. I assumed it was some non-essential part of Lubuntu but was marked as critical simply because it was a system program (also, my fears were mostly abated by the exceptionally casual nature with which the posters in that other thread instructed the OP to purge his tzdata).\nSo I typed the phrase and hit enter, and.... it started removing EVERYTHING. All the stuff I had set up, was being removed. Then, as I was doing it over VNC and the VNC died, I ran to the physical screen. It was quickly crashing because my keep-the-vnc-going scripts were layering onto of each other and exponentially increasing in number. So with the GUI completely unresponsive (I waited five minutes and nothing would happen except more scripts occasionally appeared), I hit the reset button on the PC.\nIt didn't boot into Lubuntu but memtest(x86) for some reason.\nSo this is where we are right now.

Save any files that you don't have backups for onto a thumb drive or similar and in future note what apt is telling you it will remove.  To save files, boot into a live session, like with the default Ubuntu disc, mount your partition that contains /home and copy your files out of there onto a thumb drive.

It can be that on both 10.04 and 14.04, there was such an illegal access to memory, but it did not cause any problem on 10.04.\nRules are not strictly enforced\nThat would mean it worked just by chance in 10.04; That is quite possible, because for many reasons, memory nearby the \"official\" memory of your program may also belong to your program technically.\nThat is to make thinks easier for the compiler, or make the program faster by more regular memory access.\nBy this, the program may be allowed to do things that it is not allowed to do based on the program text.\nTolerance can change\nWhich \"inofficial\" memory you can access without a segmentation fault depends on the compiler version, and library versions, which both have changed.\nThe simplest, and most common case should be that there is a bug in the program where a memory access went to far, like accessing the byte after an array by an of-by-one error in the index.\nSummary\nThe bug existed before, but it worked anyway.\nNow, it does not work, and it's just a normal bug that causes a segmentation fault.\nFor a positive aspect: when it worked, with the bug, it may have created wrong results - which is much worse than the crash you see now.\n\nEnforce the rules\nA good approach to debug this kind of problem is to instrument the program to enforce the rules that are not enforced by the normal runtime system.\nOne tool to do this when looking for problem with memory access is valgrind (man valgrind).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 WiFi problems I have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed on an HP Touchsmart laptop and I'm having issues connecting to the Internet at home. \nMy PC has a Realtek RTL8188EE 802.11bgn Wi-Fi Adapter, and it dual-boots Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

After booting, the login screen freezes and I can't use keyboard and mouse, actually no input hardware at all.\nIn recovery mode, it works fine.\nI tried to sudo apt-get update in recovery mode and re-boot, but nothing happens.\n\nA: I noticed that USB mouse/keyword worked in the recovery mode every time.  The problem is that I end up with crappy graphics mode in recovery so I basically just force the normal boot to go through recovery by adding \"recovery\" to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in /etc/default/grub.  My line looks like the following:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"recovery acpi=force irqpoll usbcore.autosuspend=-1\"\n\nalong with all the options that I have tried and failed.  I also tried the following (from another askubuntu question), which worked for some time:\n sudo powernap-action --disable usb_autosuspend\n\nHowever, I think \"recovery\" is the only thing you need.  You had to press enter a couple of times to continue booting if you go this route, but at least USB works on boot and you have good screen resolution.\nPS. I had this problem with Ubuntu 14.04, and after switching to Mint 17, had the same issue.

But when I run the mongo command following error was displayed in the terminal.\n\nFailed global initialization: BadValue Invalid or no user locale set. Please ensure LANG and/or LC_* environment variables are set correctly\n\n\nA: Looks like your locale settings are broken or non-existent on that VM, or at least that session on that VM.  One of MongoDB's dependencies (boost) will fail when a locale is not correctly set (see SERVER-9032).  For reference, before the change in SERVER-9032 this problem still happened but looked like this.  \nSometimes logging out and back in can fix it (only broken for current session), or you can try running sudo locale-gen to make sure generation is successful.  \nIn the meantime, as a workaround to get mongo (or mongod etc.) running, just set your LC_ALL variable manually before starting the program:\nexport LC_ALL=C\nmongo \n\n\nA: Though the other answers provided here solve the problem correctly the following Stackoverflow question brought me to what the actual issue is when having MongoDB installed in a Vagrant VM and getting the above error:\n\nThis problem appears because host machine put locale to guest via ssh.\n\nThus the answer suggesting to override the host locale within the Vagrantfile solves it permanently with just a line:\nVagrant.configure(2) do |config|\n\n    ENV['LC_ALL']=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\n\n    # ...\n\nend\n\nAlso note the comments about that it does not modify the actual LC_ALL value on the host.\n\nA: I also tried installing MongoDB on Ubuntu 12.04 and got the same error on a virtual machine (XEN). For me, modifiying /etc/default/locale did the trick. I got it working with these settings:\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_US\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n\nOr, another working config would be (mind the quotes and the :en):\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLANGUAGE=\"en_US:en\"\nLC_ALL=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\n\nAdam C's workaround with export also helped and is probably the more elaborate answer. \n\nA: Based on this https://askubuntu.com/a/227513/59618 you can just:\n$ sudo locale-gen \"en_US.UTF-8\"\nGenerating locales...\n  en_US.UTF-8... done\nGeneration complete.\n\n$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales\nGenerating locales...\n  en_US.UTF-8... up-to-date\nGeneration complete.\n\n", "Q: Can't log into my computer after video cart update This morning I tried to update my video card, my computer has 8gb of ram, i7-2600k, and a gtx750ti.

However, they should already be available (in older versions) via the installed Ubuntu package poppler-utils. \nWhy doesn't Zotero find these programs? Of course, I could just reinstall them in the suggested way but generally I prefer to install software only from the Ubuntu repository.\n\nA: From the Zotero documentation \n\nZotero uses customized, platform-specific versions of the pdfinfo and\n  pdftotext utilities from the open-source Xpdf project for PDF\n  indexing. Specifically, Zotero uses modified binaries of pdfinfo and\n  pdftotext on Windows to prevent the command-prompt window from\n  appearing at indexing time, and a custom build of pdfinfo on all\n  platforms that support writing to a text file (see source code).\n\nSo this is expected behavior on the part of both Zotero and Ubuntu.

That doesn't happen.\nAudacity immediately recognized USB M-Audio with no issues, EVEN THOUGH Alsa mixer keeps on Intel internal audio card.\nAlsa mixer do recognize USB M-Audio card but do not use it saying that there are no parameteres available.\nThe question is: why is USB M-Audio card available for Audacity with no issues, and Alsa will not use it for other applications, like music players or Web browsers...?\nThanks is advance for your support. All the best, RC\n\nA: PulseAudio is used on top of ALSA to manage applications use of your onboard soundcard. However, it is not preloaded in a standard Lubuntu install. To get PulseAudio open your terminal and type\nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\n\nA: Audacity uses ALSA.\nThe default card is whatever card has been seen first.\nTo change the order of the sound drivers, add the following lines at the end of /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf:\noptions snd-usb-audio index=0\noptions snd-hda-intel index=1\n\nand reboot.\n\nA: \nAudacity immediately recognized USB M-Audio with no issues, EVEN THOUGH Alsa mixer keeps on Intel internal audio card.\n\nTo my knowledge alsamixer doesn't manage which application uses which interface/soundcard/output, you can only set the software controls (some may have only hardware controls and don't offer any software controls) for the devices detected by Alsa.\nThe default Ubuntu desktop installation uses PulseAudio on top of Alsa to manage which application uses which soundcard.

Everyday I open my pc and most of these days a Numix Icons update welcomes me? I'm starting to get suspicious about these.

The graphic card is G105M. I wanted to have the NVIDIA drivers for being able to suspend the computer.How can I fix it?\n\nA: Your video card drivers version should be 340.46. I am sure you can open nviida-settings and check out version, and also adjust all related power-management fields in nvidia-settings. \nIn Kubuntu default power management, make sure you check your settings for all of the 3 sections present in there, namely AC POWER, ON BATTERY, ON LOW BATTERY. Disable Dim Display feature for AC POWER, ON BATTERY and ON LOW BATTERY, and disable Suspend feature for ON LOW BATTERY. \nYou can always reinstall your drivers from nvidia official page, and this is the link for G105M 32bit, and this one is for G105M 64bit. These are complete drivers, and not stripped drivers, and to install these drivers after downloading them you need to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 key combination, login with username and password, and run the usual command for installing drivers. Nvidia installer will give you a prompt about uninstalling old drivers in order to install the new ones. \nIf you find errors when trying to install official drivers for nvidia cards, you need to install previously to that the following packages --> dkms fakeroot build-essential:\n  sudo apt-get install dkms fakeroot build-essential\n\nAftyer that you reboot, and finally you can enter the text-mode console (press Ctrl+Alt+F1 key combination, login with username and password) and install new drivers. \nThis one is for 32bit Ubuntu:\n  sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-340.46.run\n\nThis one for 64bit Ubuntu:\n  sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.46.run\n\nAfter reboot, run this command in a terminal window:\n  sudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nAnd reboot again, and you're done, you can open nvidia settings with sudo nvidia-settings command, adjust settings to your preference, apply new settings and Save to x configuration file (uncheck \"Merge with..\" when saving your new X config)\nDo the same steps in Kubuntu power management as shown above, and also make sure you adjust video drivers with nvidia-settings to match your power-manager configuration.\n", "Q: Give full permission to a folder in an Ethernet I have two ubuntu machines (machineA and machineB)connected through a wired Ethernet cable. I'm asking how I can give full permission and access of machineA to a certain folder Folder1 in the machineB over the network using terminal?\n\nA: Basically, I see two possibilities: Samba or NFS.  Both are client/server software which means you need to install the client part on your machineA and the server part on your machineB.  From that point on, you can get access the files on the server via any software (including terminal) on the client.  \nOn the differences, samba is based on the windows world.  Therefore, files made available in samba are readily available also to Windows-based PC.\nNFS stands for Network File System and allows you to mount on PC A (the client) directories that reside on PC B (the server).  Once setup, it is completely transparent to the user.  A standard windows PC would not see them, however.\nA more complete discussion on the differences can be found here: Which to use NFS or Samba?\nFor a fairly complete discusion on how to install NFS, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo\n", "Q: how to know which program uses key as keyshortcuts related to https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/316\nF12 cannot be assigned as toggle guake terminal.

Start making backup.\n    echo \"ok \" . shell_exec($strBK);\n\nBut from php, I get the following error:\n ok pg_dump: [archiver (db)] connection to database \"dbESM\" failed:\n fe_sendauth: no password supplied\n pg_dump: *** aborted because of error\n\nAs is shown, I'm not asking for the password but the script reports the error about authentication.\nMy assumption is that PHP runs under www-data while the terminal dump runs as the computer user. So how do I fix this issue in a safe way?\n\nA: You can test your theory (www-data can't run the command) by running:\nsudo -iu www-data /usr/bin/pg_dump ...\n\nThis likely is the issue and there are a number of different workarounds with different security ramifications.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a script that runs your dump, owned by your user, with setuid applied (chmod 4755 <filename>). Whoever runs this will run it as the owner of the file. There are obvious security ramifications if your script is editable by PHP too, or your script is somehow exploitable.\n\n*Use a middle-man. You could write to a file from PHP and read it from a cron-job (running as the right user). If the file exists it runs your dump and deletes the file. This is fairly secure but it's obviously only as instant as your cron interval. Alternatives include things like Celery which is a bit more industrial for batching or deferring tasks, optionally to other users.\n\n*Beat Postgres into allowing www-data access the data. I would suggest doing this through a password but this is still going to allow a hacked www-data access to anything you give it.\nThe pg_dump command may also have some peculiarities. There are a few threads around SE that might help with it specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2893954/how-to-pass-in-password-to-pg-dump\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1401002/trick-an-application-into-thinking-its-stdin-is-interactive-not-a-pipe\n", "Q: Run commands on system shutdown/reboot/logout I would like to run certain aliases and simple commands when system shuts down or reboots or when I simply log out of system. This would help a lot as I usually forget about shutting down vagrant ( vagrant halt ) and some other terminal commands.\nDo we have some kind of bash files or scripts so I can achieve this on Ubuntu 14.04. \n\nA: Runlevel 0 corresponds to shutdown, and Runlevel 6 corresponds to reboot.\nThe /etc/rc[0-6].d/ directories contain scripts that are executed when a particular runlevel is initiated.\nSo you can write a script that contains commands to shutdown various processes, and store that script in /etc/rc0.d/K99_yourscript and make it executable. This will run your script at shutdown. Copy the script over to /etc/rc6.d/K99_yourscript to have it execute on reboot as well.\n", "Q: cannot install plug-ins for Gimp in Xubuntu 14.04 I am trying to install \"Upsize.C\" and \"noise-generator-0.2.5\" for gimp.\nfor upsize.c happens this:\nchristian@mobile02:~/software/gimp-plug-ins$ gimptool-2.0 --install upsize.c\ngcc  -pthread -I/usr/include/gtk-2.0 -I/usr/include/gdk-pixbuf-2.0 -I/usr/include/cairo -I/usr/include/libpng12 -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include -I/usr/include/pixman-1 -I/usr/include/freetype2 -I/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/gtk-2.0/include -I/usr/include/atk-1.0 -I/usr/include/pango-1.0 -I/usr/include/gio-unix-2.0/ -I/usr/include/harfbuzz -I/usr/include/gimp-2.0   -o /home/christian/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins/upsize upsize.c  -lgimpui-2.0 -lgimpwidgets-2.0 -lgimpmodule-2.0 -lgimp-2.0 -lgimpmath-2.0 -lgimpconfig-2.0 -lgimpcolor-2.0 -lgimpbase-2.0 -lgtk-x11-2.0 -lgdk-x11-2.0 -latk-1.0 -lgio-2.0 -lpangoft2-1.0 -lpangocairo-1.0 -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lcairo -lpango-1.0 -lfontconfig -lgobject-2.0 -lglib-2.0 -lfreetype   \n/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccCGidxO.o: undefined reference to symbol 'floor@@GLIBC_2.0'\n//lib/i386-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\ntrying to install noise generator happens this:\nchristian@mobile02:~/software/gimp-plug-ins/noise-generator-0.2.5$ make\nmake -C po\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/home/christian/software/gimp-plug-ins/noise-generator-0.2.5/po'\nmsgfmt -c -v -o de.mo de.po\nde.po:7: warning: header field 'Language' missing in header\n34 translated messages.\nmsgfmt -c -v -o pl.mo pl.po\npl.po:2: warning: header field 'Language' missing in header\n34 translated messages.\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/christian/software/gimp-plug-ins/noise-generator-0.2.5/po'\nmake -C src\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/home/christian/software/gimp-plug-ins/noise-generator-0.2.5/src'\ncc -O3 -Wall -pthread -I/usr/include/gtk-2.0 -I/usr/include/gdk-pixbuf-2.0 -I/usr/include/cairo -I/usr/include/libpng12 -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include -I/usr/include/pixman-1 -I/usr/include/freetype2 -I/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/gtk-2.0/include -I/usr/include/atk-1.0 -I/usr/include/pango-1.0 -I/usr/include/gio-unix-2.0/ -I/usr/include/harfbuzz -I/usr/include/gimp-2.0   -o noise-generator plugin.o noise.o events.o interface.o colour.o poisson_gui.o gauss_gui.o uniform_gui.o laplace_gui.o lorentz_gui.o -lgimpui-2.0 -lgimpwidgets-2.0 -lgimpmodule-2.0 -lgimp-2.0 -lgimpmath-2.0 -lgimpconfig-2.0 -lgimpcolor-2.0 -lgimpbase-2.0 -lgtk-x11-2.0 -lgdk-x11-2.0 -latk-1.0 -lgio-2.0 -lpangoft2-1.0 -lpangocairo-1.0 -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lcairo -lpango-1.0 -lfontconfig -lgobject-2.0 -lglib-2.0 -lfreetype  \n/usr/bin/ld: noise.o: undefined reference to symbol 'sqrtf@@GLIBC_2.0'\n//lib/i386-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake[1]: *** [noise-generator] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/christian/software/gimp-plug-ins/noise-generator-0.2.5/src'\nmake: *** [src] Error 2\n\nmake install returns:\nchristian@mobile02:~/software/gimp-plug-ins/noise-generator-0.2.5$ make install\nmake -C po install\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/home/christian/software/gimp-plug-ins/noise-generator-0.2.5/po'\nmsgfmt -c -v -o de.mo de.po\nde.po:7: warning: header field 'Language' missing in header\n34 translated messages.\nmsgfmt -c -v -o pl.mo pl.po\npl.po:2: warning: header field 'Language' missing in header\n34 translated messages.\nfor L in de pl; \\\n    do install -v -m 0644 $L.mo \"/usr/share/locale/$L/LC_MESSAGES/gimp20-noise-generator-plug-in.mo\"; \\\ndone\ninstall: cannot remove ‘/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/gimp20-noise-generator-plug-in.mo’: Permission denied\ninstall: cannot remove ‘/usr/share/locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/gimp20-noise-generator-plug-in.mo’: Permission denied\nmake[1]: *** [install] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/christian/software/gimp-plug-ins/noise-generator-0.2.5/po'\nmake: *** [install] Error 2\n\nnow I do not understand what is wrong, I did this operation already several times successfully on previous versions\nstill I am sure it is something very simple\nThank you all for your help\n\nA: I know this answer is a lot late but if you are facing the same issue, if found a solution for noise generator(I didn't use the other plugin yet).

In Xubuntu 14.04. accessing the settings to disable and enable the touchpad are a bit hidden - in Settings-Mouse and Touchpad, and once there, there are a few other clicks needed.\n\nI have tried by installing the panel application touchpad-indicator - but that seemed buggy in Xfce maybe due to conflicts with the Xfce settings... \nIs there a quick and safe method to enable/disable touchpad?\n\nA: The non-launcher version:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# toggle state of synaptics touchpad\n\ntpid=`xinput list | grep SynPS | sed 's/.*id\\=\\([0-9]\\+\\).*/\\1/g'`\n\ndeclare -i status\nstatus=`xinput list-props ${tpid} | grep Device\\ Enabled | sed -e 's/.*\\:[ \\t]\\+//g'`\n\nif [ 0 -eq ${status} ] ; then\n    xinput enable ${tpid}\nelse\n    xinput disable ${tpid}\nfi\n\n\nA: That can be easily done with these two commands (inspired by a different answer):\nDisable:\nsynclient TouchpadOff=1\n\nEnable:\nsynclient TouchpadOff=0\n\n\nMy initial answer was to use \nxinput set-prop 15 \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\nand\nxinput set-prop 15 \"Device Enabled\" 1\n\nwhere the id number may be other than 15: it can be be found by running\nxinput list\n\nI found about these commands in this answer under a question on how to disable the touchpad.\n\nThe commands can be added into launchers.\nI prefer creating .desktop files (in usr/share/applications or in .local/share/applications) for the two commands to be run easily with a launcher like Whisker Menu, Synapse, etc\n\nAlso:\n\n\n*\n\n*by adding them into a single launcher, \n\n*setting advanced properties like in the image below \n\n(namely 'show last used item' and 'inside button'), \n\n\n*\n\n*and adding two specific icons, \n\n\nthe launcher will always display the current status of the touchpad.  \n\n\nAlso it is never a bad idea to assign shortcuts (Settings Manager - Keyboard - Application Shortcuts) to the two commands.\n\nA: I have used @cipricus and @Demeter answers, but without using synclient, i thought that would be good to share:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nTOGGLE=$HOME/.toggle\nTOUCHPAD_ID=$(xinput list | grep \"Touchpad\" | grep -Eow '[0-9]{2}')\n\nif [ ! -e $TOGGLE ]; then\n   touch $TOGGLE\n   xinput set-prop $TOUCHPAD_ID \"Device Enabled\" 0\nelse\n   rm $TOGGLE\n   xinput set-prop $TOUCHPAD_ID \"Device Enabled\" 1\nfi\n\n\nA: You also can use synclient, like in this answer.\nTo turn off touchpad:\nsynclient TouchpadOff=1\n\nTo turn on:\nsynclient TouchpadOff=0\n\nI think this is more convenient way. You don't need to know device id. \nSo my solution is to create bash script ~/toggle-touchpad.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nif synclient | grep --quiet 'TouchpadOff             = 0'; then\n  synclient TouchpadOff=1\n  notify-send Touchpad Disabled\nelse\n  synclient TouchpadOff=0\n  notify-send Touchpad Enabled\nfi\n\nModify file permission:\nsudo chmod +x ./toggle-touchpad.sh\n\nNext goto Settings-Keyboard-Application Shortcuts and add new shortcut. Enter path to the script (/home/your_username/toggle-touchpad.sh - for example). Specify shortcut (Fn+F9 in my case). \nDone.

So:\n\n\n*\n\n*dd makes a byte-for-byte copy, so the total size of the partition matters, not what's in the partition.\n\n*Yes. It will grow to 220 GB.\n\n*You can compress the resulting image using gzip or xz: \nsudo dd if=/dev/sda1 | xz > /tmp/ubuntu.image\n\n\n*Depends on what you call a better tool. For some tasks, a byte-for-byte copy is needed (say, data recovery from a failing disk). In such cases, dd + compression is the simplest way. If not, consider something like partimage .\n\n\nA: Well... you have good answers about the size of the dd file (which if uncompressed is the same size of the partition). \nBut I see another problem here: you have: \nbash$ df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1       220G  5.8G  203G   3% /\n[...]\n\n... and /tmp is not mounted elsewhere, so it's on /dev/sda1, and /dev/sda1 is mounted. \nSo if you do: \n sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/tmp/ubuntu.image \n\nyou are copying an image of /dev/sda1 partition on a filesystem on the same partition --- which will cause:\n\n\n*\n\n*to fill the partition before the command will have a chance to finish (think about it), unless compressing on-the-fly and being lucky, but\n\n*to record a file with a completely inconsistent copy of that partition; mounted partitions are changing all the time in a multitasking operating system. \nAs a rule of thumb, you dd a partition only when it is not mounted. \nMoreover, given that the partition is the / partition of your system, and that you are executing the command as root, you will completely fill your root partition (root reserved space will be used up), and you risk to need to boot with a rescue disc to recovery the mess...\n\nA: It's my understanding that dd makes an exact clone of the drive, including empty space. If your drive is 220GB, dd will make a copy that is 220GB, regardless of how much of that space is used.\nThis answer on ServerFault recommends piping through gzip which should be a pretty efficient way to compress the unused space.\ndd if=/dev/sda1 | gzip -c  > /tmp/ubuntu.image\n\nYou may also wish to defragment first and write zeros to the empty space, both of which could theoretically make the compression more efficient.\n", "Q: How to add running program icon to left-side bar?

I want to setup a local web server on my Ubuntu (14.04). So I installed all software to get a LAMP server.\nThe problem is that I do something wrong with creating my virtualhosts. I wanted to create different subdomains on my localhost. So for example site1.localhost and site2.localhost.\nIn my /var/www/ directory I created a symbolic link \"site1\" going to /home/user/Workspaces/site1.\nIn my Apache error.log file I got the following error.\n[core:error] [pid 12679] [client 127.0.0.1:59006] AH00037: Symbolic link not allowed or link target not accessible: /var/www/site1\n\nIn my apache configuration I have:\n<Directory /var/www/>\nOptions Indexes FollowSymLinks\nAllowOverride None\nRequire all granted\n</Directory>\n\nSo I think there is something wrong with the permissions of the folders.

There are no files or directories specifying \"www-data\".  Did you change all these yourself?  There is a lot of outdated or simply incorrect information on how to set up web servers, so be careful who you follow, and undo what doesn't work.  \nThat said, \"site1\" should be in the html directory, and owned by you.  It doesn't really need to be a symlink; you can specify a different directory in the config file.  Something like this:\n# Add this to the end of the existing 000-default.conf file (after \"</VirtualHost>\")\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    <Directory  /home/user/Workspaces/site1>\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n    </Directory>\n    DocumentRoot /home/user/Workspaces/site1\n    ServerName site1\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\nA: Solution for: Symbolic link not allowed or link target not accessible: /var/www/html/mySymbolicLink.\nThis clearly is a problem with the permissions. The problem is that the html under your home directory is owned by your user, and the apache server is run by another user so therefore cannot access your home directory. \nThe solution then would be adding the user running apache to your group, normally the same as your username. So, in my CentOS box I did it as:\nsudo usermod -a -G dev apache\n\nSo this add the user apache to the group dev. Now i need to give execution permissions.\nIn /home:\nchmod g+x dev -R\n\nThis will  grant execution permission to my folder only for the members of group. And thats it. You will need to modify the Apache user for whatever is running your web server, I believe for Ubuntu the user is www-data. \n", "Q: Internet connection drops on ubuntu 14.04 (TP-Link TLWN821N v4 ) I am a new linux user. \nI have recently experienced many problems with my wireless usb adaptar (realtek 8192cu); I succeeded solving them using ubuntu 13.04, however ubuntu 14.04 is much more presistent; after a week and half of searchings, I am simply lost. \nThe official driver http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=48&PFid=48&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false&Downloads=true#RTL8192CU does not officialy support kernel 3.13, but only up to 3.9.\nI implemented a brilliant solution detailed at this page (https://code.google.com/p/realtek-8188cus-wireless-drivers-3444749-ubuntu-1304/issues/detail?id=12), but as noted, it doesn't work for 14.04.\nWhile it is true that the problem is marked as solved in ubuntu wireless network adaptars section, as noted, the solutions do not work in 14.04.\nI'd like to note that there is huge difference between WN821N v1,2,3 and v4 - the latter is constructed on realtek chipests, while others are made by Atheros, so, even though there are solutions for other versions, I couldn't find (after more than week of searching, even in askubuntu.com) after more than week of searchings any working solution to my problem.\n\nA: I have had the same issues with the 8192cu until I installed the dkms driver via https://github.com/vincent-t/rt8192cu_dkms\nNow the connection is fast and stable.\n", "Q: Updates Installed without asking password Software Updater installed updates on my computer without asking any password.

There have been no drivers for other operating systems\nTry a light version of ubuntu (without Unity 3D desktop) like Lubuntu and see how far it gets you, but there is very little chance that it will be better than Windows 7 (except, maybe, for OS speed). \nIf you want to fiddle with it, check out this page and this page for some info.\nMore descriptional info here\n", "Q: GParted Unknown Partition I recently opened up GParted to partition some space and I noticed an unknown partition being listen. I don't know whether this is why my computer has booting/waking from suspend really slowly but if someone could give me advice on whether to ignore it or directions on how to fix it, that'd be great.\n\n\nA: That unknown partition is the windows system reserved created by the Windows 7 or 8 when doing their respective installation. It is approximately 128 MB for system reserved stuff, which includes part of the installation process and booting. You do not want to delete that partition except if you want to remove Windows completely.\nThe flag shown in the image (msftres or Microsoft Reserved) can be found in Is it safe to format msftres, msftdata and hidden partitions?\nIf you go into Windows you will not see this partition on it since it is marked with a special flag that tells the Disk manager (In Windows) not to see it). With Ubuntu using any partition manager can see it. I recommend not moving the partition, resizing it, deleting it or doing any changes to it unless you want to have some Windows issues.\n", "Q: Running command at certain time or after that as soon as possible I have folder for temporary folders and I would like it to be emptied automatically at 3am. I know crontab probably could do this but what if my laptop isn't on when it should run?\n\nA: The answer to your problem is Anacron. It comes with Ubuntu by default. Just put your script in one of these folders and make it executable:\n/etc/cron.hourly  # run hourly, only available since Ubuntu 14.04\n/etc/cron.daily   # run daily\n/etc/cron.weekly  # run weekly\n/etc/cron.monthly # run monthly\n\nFor finetuning check out the anacron manpage.

I have the recovery CD's for windows 8, I am just not sure how to go about restoring the laptop back to factory fresh.\nDoesn't seem like there is a F11 recovery partition anymore either.\n\nA: You probably deleted your recovery partition during the Ubuntu installation. This can happen if you choose the \"Use entire disk\" option when installing. The Windows 8 recovery CD's may restore these partitions if they are branded with the OEM manufacturer of your computer (Lenovo).\nUnfortunately, using these restore disks will completely re-partition the disk, destroying all data that is currently on it. Therefore, if you want to dual boot you will have to make a backup of some things in Ubuntu before proceeding.\nThis can be done by repartitioning an external drive, for example, with an EXT4 partition using gparted-pkexec. EXT4 is needed in order to preserve file permissions and ownership. Copying the necessary files to an NTFS or FAT32 partition made with Windows or shipped by default on most externals will not work.\nNOTE: /media/[username]/[external partition UUID or label] needs some replacements. After you create a new EXT4 partition on an external drive, it will be assigned a random UUID (or label if you chose to label it in gparted-pkexec). Once you plug in the drive it will be mounted to a place like /media/tony/1961fe96-3398-4094-94af-6445c4a8b9fc.\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need to back up your home folder(s) in order to migrate your settings to a new Ubuntu installation after reinstalling Windows.\nsudo rsync -av /home/ /media/[username]/[external partition UUID or label]/\n\n*Additionally, you'll probably want to make a list of installed packages as well so you can restore them later\necho -e '#!/bin/bash\\n\\nsudo apt-get install ' $(comm -23 <(apt-mark showmanual | sort -u) <(gzip -dc /var/log/installer/initial-status.gz | sed -n 's/^Package: //p' | sort -u) | awk '{printf(\"%s \",$0)}') > /media/[username]/[external partition UUID or label]/packages.sh;chmod +x /media/[username]/[external partition UUID or label]/packages.sh\n\n*Also, if you've many any changes to configuration files in /etc, you may want to back those up as well.\n\n*Finally, you can install Windows 8 using the recovery CD's.\n\n*After using the recovery disks to re-install Windows 8, the first thing you should do before installing any software is go to the Disk Management tool in the Control Panel->System and Security->Administrative Tools->Computer Management and then click Disk Management. Find your C: drive and resize it as small as it will go, but leave as much space at the end as you need for other applications. The remaining space will be used for Ubuntu.\n\n*After this process, reboot the computer with the Ubuntu USB inserted.\n\n*When Ubuntu asks, tell it you want to install it alongside Windows 8.\n\n*Wait for the installation to finish and reboot into Ubuntu\n\n*In Ubuntu, open a terminal and run\nsudo rsync -a /media/[username]/[external partition UUID or label]/home/ /home/\n\n\n*Copy over the /etc config files if applicable\n\n*Restore your old packages with this command (be patient, they'll have to be re-downloaded):\nsudo ./media/[username]/[external partition UUID or label]/packages.sh\n\n\n*Now, your Ubuntu should be back as it was and it is installed alongside Windows 8!\n\nA: Try booting up off of the recovery CD, and that may have a installer on it. You may also be able to contact the manufacturer (Lenovo I believe, not positive, although I'm sure you know XD), and ask them for a installer (they'll probably want your serial and proof of purchase).\n", "Q: How to PXE network boot Ubuntu Server 14.04 using NFS So far I have a PXE server based on Ubuntu Server 14.04 setup and running, configured to serve a Linux Mint 17 live CD and Ubuntu Server 14.04.  The aim is to use NFS to serve install media around the network.  The problem is the files are not being served by NFS.\nTo setup the basic PXE server on a clean Ubuntu Server 14.04 install I followed the instructions here: http://www.unixmen.com/install-configure-pxe-server-ubuntu-14-04-lts/\nDHCP is running on my central IPCOP as per the instructions here: http://www.ipcops.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=17515\nNFS has been setup to serve the /exports directory which contains the contents of the Linux Mint and Ubuntu Server install ISO images.

Or is a universal thing?\nI'd like to create the bootable USB drive on a computer where the connection is much faster that the computer I plan on using Ubuntu on.\n\nA: No, it doesn't matter on what computer you create the bootstick on. The stick can then be booted from basically any computer with support for the installed architecture.\nExample: If you download the 64bit ISO for a 64bit computer, on a 32bit computer, you can create the bootstick from on this 32bit machine. However, you can't boot Ubuntu on this machine, since it doesn't understand 64bit instructions. If you now plug the stick into the 64bit computer, you can boot Ubuntu from there.\nThink of the bootstick as a DVD: You can burn a DVD on one computer and boot Ubuntu from it on another one. The bootstick is nearly the same.\n\nMy preference: Use UNetBootin for creating the bootstick. It's the best-working tool I know and is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.\n", "Q: Diagnosing Samba I have set up network shares on three Ubuntu computers in my LAN using system-config-samba.

You can find instructions for your specific router here.  \nSpecifically, you want to forward incoming traffic on port 32887 of your router to your computer's internal IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.XXX) on the same port.\nAfter you set up your router to forward traffic to your computer, simply give your friends your external IP address (e.g. 208.67.220.220) and you're good to go.\nN.B. External vs. Internal IP addresses:\nYour external IP address is the address the outside world sees your LAN as. You can find this with a third party service such as this. This is the address you need to give to your friends so they can play on your server. On the other hand, your internal IP address is where your computer is on your network. Normally, an internal IP address is of the form 192.168.1.XXX on Cisco/Linksys routers. You need to set up port forwarding at your internal IP address so that it can talk to your computer.\nExtra Reading:\nWhat is an IP Address?\nExternal vs Internal IP Addresses\n", "Q: Why are the installed linux header files empty?

It's part of a \n  clever trick to optimize the kernel build.\nThe kernel configuration (stored in .config) is used to generate a\n  header file which is used throughout the kernel. \n  The problem is that changing one option means all files which include\n  config.h will need to be rebuilt, even though most of them may not be\n  affected by that option.\nThis is solved by removing the makefile dependency on config.h and\n  replacing it by a dependency on one of the files in include/config.\n  Each file there corresponds to a configuration option. Whenever that\n  option is changed the configuration system touches that file (updating\n  its timestamp causing make to rebuild all dependant files.\n\n", "Q: nm-applet not running on startup I have installed MATE on Ubuntu 14.04 and nm-applet doesn't run on startup despite being set as a startup application and being installed.

Open x2go client in the New Session window go to the Input/output tab.\nIn the Display section you can choose the radio button of Use Whole Display and choose number of displays you want to use (number range from 1 to the your number of monitors).\n\n\nSecond Solution\nFreeRDP will probably do what you want.\nIt's better to compile FreeRDP from sources because Multi-Monitor support is only available in versions >= 1.1.\nVisit this page to learn how to install it from source.\nNow you can use xfreerdp command from terminal:\nxfreerdp /multimon /u:username /v:server_address:server_port\n\nwhere username is your username on server, server_address is server location (IP address or hostname) and server_port is port (leave empty without \":\" for default port).\nIf you dont like to build from source you can still install it using:\nsudo apt-get install freerdp-x11\n\nBut you have to be sure that the version is >1.1\n\nA: I used NoMachine NX for a long time which worked well for me. The server run on a Ubuntu Server and I was able to connect from both Windows and Linux.\nAccording to this article, the previous version 3.5 (current is 4.x) already supported multiple monitors what is said to be improved in 4.x.\nIf this is what you are looking for, you could give it a try as there is a free version. When I used it the last time there were some limitations in the free version like only one session at a time. I can't tell you if it is still like that.\nEdit: To what you said about:\n\n...regardless of how many monitors are connected to the server (perhaps\n  zero!).\n\nMy Server was headless so you don't need to worry about it's monitors. It's not like VNC but opens an own session.\nAnd in addition: There is also a completely free version of NX. But I haven't any experiences with it.\n\nA: This is a simple solution that works for me as I work remotely with multiple monitors as well as across platforms.(Windows, Mac, and Linux)\nI use a program called Teamviewer, that can be located at Teamviewer.com I am currently running it through wine but have run the linux version successfully as well. \nIt will allow you to quickly switch between monitors although I haven't been successful at showing more than one at a time. \nThis has the added perk of your being able to go to any computer, sign in at their site, and access your computers from anywhere without loading the program.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can achieve that easily with x2go.\n\n*On the input/output tab make sure to check the two options: Fullscreen ,Xinerama.\n\nExample : x2go setting\nRead more here\n", "Q: Eclipse luna crashes on new project in Kubuntu 14.04 I'm having some trouble getting Eclipse Luna to work.

The shortcut will now be disabled.\n\nA: I had Ctrl +Space set to \"next input method\" (whatever that means) in my IBus Preferences. It said space, so I took all that out and left it an empty field.

If you don't want to use Unity (Replace it with Cinnamon or something else), and then use Window decoration in CCSM and remove 'any' Decoration Window.('any' is for applying decoration to all the windows). \n\nIf you want to use Unity then there is workaround or you can say its the way unity handle things. Unity handle window decoration through themes. So any change that has to be made in decoration has to be done through themes.

Do they get killed by the init process eventually? I have a zombie process problem.\nI read What is a <defunct> process, and why doesn't it get killed? which says\n\nThere is no harm in letting such processes be unless there are many of them. Zombie is eventually reaped by its parent (by calling wait(2)). If original parent hasn't reaped it before its own exit then init process (pid == 1) does it at some later time.\n\nI don't understand this.\nDoes it mean that eventually the zombie process's entry will be deleted from process table and killed successfully by the init process (Pid = 1)?\nI think zombie processes causes a memory shortage problem, because they don't return allocated memory space.\nAm I right?\n\nA: *\n\n*Zombie processes don’t use up any system resources. (Actually, each one uses a very tiny amount of system memory to store its process descriptor.) However, each zombie process retains its process ID (PID)\n\n*Linux systems have a finite number of process IDs – 32767 by default on 32-bit systems. If zombies are accumulating at a very quick rate – for example, if improperly programmed server software is creating zombie processes under load — the entire pool of available PIDs will eventually become assigned to zombie processes, preventing other processes from launching.\n\n*Getting Rid of Zombie Processes\nkill -s SIGCHLD pid\n\nCredit goes to : HTG\n\nA: No, Actually zombie process is \n\nIn\n  UNIX System terminology, a process that has terminated, but whose parent has not yet\n  waited for it, is called a zombie. The ps(1) command prints the state of a zombie process\n  as Z. If we write a long-running program that forks many child processes, they\n  become zombies unless we wait for them and fetch their termination status.\nThe final condition to consider is this: What happens when a process that has been\n  inherited by init terminates? Does it become a zombie? The answer is ‘‘no,’’ because\n  init is written so that whenever one of its children terminates, init calls one of the\n  wait functions to fetch the termination status. By doing this, init prevents the system\n  from being clogged by zombies. When we say ‘‘one of init’s children,’’ we mean\n  either a process that init generates directly (such as getty, which we describe in\n  Section 9.2) or a process whose parent has terminated and has been subsequently\n  inherited by init.\n   from Advance unix Programming by stevence rechard\n\n", "Q: Reinstall `ubuntu-desktop` after removing Gnome I have laptop with ubuntu 14.04  I tried to install gnome to try it and after a while I wanted to remove it so I used the following command \napt-get remove gnom*\n\nI rebooted and before the logging screen I just got a black screen \nI tried to reinstall the ubuntu-desktop with: \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nbut I keep getting the following errors: \nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\nubuntu-desktop :  \n    Depends: ubuntu-session but it is not going to be installed\n    Depends: unity-control-center but it is not going to be installed\n    Depends: unity-settings-daemon but it is not going to be installed\n    Recommends: xul-ext-webaccounts but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nsearched for most of the questions with the unmet depends  but there is no change \nI tried all the following: \nap-get update , upgrade , remove , auto remove , clean auto , clean  , apt-get -f install, dpkg --configure -a\n\nbut it's the same ... \nso any idea how i can fix this issue \n\nA: I followed the depends packages till I reached this point \nDepends: gnome-settings-daemon-schemas (< 3.10) but 3.12.2-0ubuntu1~trusty3 is to be installed\n\nso I performed the following command that enabled me to reinstall the ubuntu-desktop \nsudo apt-get install gnome-settings-daemon-schemas=3.8.6.1-0ubuntu11.2\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nI rebooted and could login to the profile \n", "Q: Installing matplotlib on Ubuntu 14.04 after installing Python 3 with pyenv I am using Ubuntu 14.04 with Python 2.7.6.

You format it by adding a new line with: * 0-23 * * * /path/script. The asterisks tell the scheduler how often to run the script and I chose once every hour or 0-23.\nBasically what I hope this script does is: figure out what hour it is, save it in a variable $time, then compare it to my if, elseif, else statement, and then change the brightness accordingly in relation to the current hour!\nYou can also add this same script to /etc/rc.local so it runs at start up!\nHopefully this will help people with battery life, brightness control, resetting brightness at every startup, etc etc!\n", "Q: ubuntu 32 bit vs 64 bit when using lots of windows applications I have acer laptop with processor capable of running 64 bit programs.

I've found a very good guide here:\nHow to create a customized ubuntu server iso\nI want to remove all the bloat that comes with a normal install, is there a way that I can determine which packages are not used at all so that I can remove them from my distro?\nOn a side note, if you do follow the guide mentioned above and you're running Ubuntu 14.04, use the following link to fix the bug with kickstart (I don't have enough reputation to add it to the comments, so if you do, please do)\nkickstart bug fix ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: You can check which files were accessed by a program using strace:\n-e trace=file\n   Trace all system calls which take a file name as  an\n   argument.   You can think of this as an abbreviation\n   for  -e trace=open,stat,chmod,unlink,...   which  is\n   useful   to   seeing   what  files  the  process  is\n   referencing.  Furthermore,  using  the  abbreviation\n   will  ensure  that  you don't accidentally forget to\n   include a call like  lstat  in  the  list.   Betchya\n   woulda forgot that one.\n\nSo, something like:\n$ strace -fe trace=file -o log /bin/bash -c ''\n$ awk -F\\\" '!a[$2]++&&/\\//{print $2}' log | xargs dpkg -S 2>/dev/null | awk -F: '!a[$1]++{print $1}'\nbash\nlibtinfo5\nlibc6\n\nBe warned, though: this output is not particularly useful one way or the other:\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't tell you which packages aren't used by a command, because the use could be by some way other than accessing a file (or maybe it accessed a file which was created by a package but not recorded in dpkg's database).\n\n*It doesn't tell you which packages could have not been used by a package. For example, if I ran an interactive bash session, the number of packages is a lot higher, mostly because the completion scripts provided by those are also being counted. The list even includes GRUB!

Given that something like Furius ISO Mount installs Nautilus and other stuff in Xfce, what would be more recommendable in Xubuntu?\nIt seems that a such application must have some level of integration with the File Manger, in this case Thunar.\nHaving a context menu \"mount\" option in Thunar for iso files like we have for partitions would be great. Maybe through Thunar custom actions?\n\n\nI used AcetoneISO in the past with Xubuntu 12.04 and 12.10. Does it work ok in 14.04? I read here, that it works bad with 13.04 (French text: Il semble que sous Ubuntu 13.04 le logiciel fonctionne mal.)\n\nEDIT after comment @Bill:\nI do not know why I cannot make work a custom action in Thunar 1.6.3 with the command provided at the link help.ubuntu.com/community/ThunarCustomActions\ngksudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 %f /mnt'\n\nI have created a custom action with that command, made it visible in the context menu by making settings similar to those presented in my answer below, but I don't see any mounted device in Thunar's left panel.\n\nA: For the limited purpose of just playing a DVD saved as iso file, open it in VLC.\nTo add a context menu action in Thunar, open the Thunar file manager anywhere click on Edit -> Configure custom actions\nit should look like so:\n\n\nand for adding the command browse for the VLC executable.\n\nFor the larger purpose of mounting iso images as described in the question:\nFrom here.\nsudo apt-get install fuseiso\n\nThis is not a gui, but Thunar custom actions will provide that.\nOpening the Thunar file manager anywhere click on Edit -> Configure custom actions\nNow you will need to add two custom actions:\na. Name: Mount image\nDescription: Mount an ISO disk image (<- this is an example, you can describe it anyway you like)\nCommand:\nmkdir %f.mount & fuseiso %f %f.mount\n\n(note: using %F instead of $f allows you to do this operation for multiple selections)\n\nUnder \"Appearance conditions\" tab - File Pattern: *.iso;*.ISO\nTick 'Other files'\n\nThis allows you to mount a file under a folder named after the file + the extension \".mount\"\n\n\nb. Name: Unmount image from this folder\nDescription: Unmount disk image removing the mount point (<- again an example)\nCommand:\nfusermount -u %f & rmdir %f\n\n(note: again, %F is for multiple selections)\n\nUnder \"Appearance conditions\" tab - File Pattern: *.mount\nTick \"Directories\"\n\nThis unmounts the image and removes the directory. To keep the directory, simply remove \"& rmdir %f\" from the command\n\nAlternative to (b):\nTo unmount an ISO by right clicking on it, rather than it's mount point, use:\nCommand:\nfusermount -u %f.mount & rmdir %f.mount\n\n\nUnder \"Appearance conditions\" tab - File pattern: *.iso;*.ISO\nTick 'Other files'\n\n\n--\nWhat I do not like is that the commands appear in the context menu even if they are not applicable: mount when it is already mounted, unmount when it is not mounted.\n\nA: You do not have to install fuseiso but can use udisksctl which comes preinstalled and is a lot easier to handle.\nIn Thunar go to „Custom Actions“ as pointed out by cipricus. Create a new action and add a description. The command to use is\nudisksctl loop-setup -f %f\n\nGot to „Conditions“ tab and check „other files“ and enter *.iso;*.ISO as file pattern.\nThis action will mount your iso into /media/$USER/ and unmounting will be easy for thunar can do that out of the box so there is no need to create an additional custom action.\n\nA: This action is default in PCManFM, the default file manager in Lubuntu. You may consider installing that in Xubuntu.\n\nSorry for the German ;) Einhängen = Mount\n\nA: You can use the command gksudo 'mount -o loop -t iso9660 %f /mnt'.\nI know you said it didn't work, but that is because of a typo. The  last character is a ' (single quote), but the one bewtween gksudo and mount was missing.\nHowever, even doing it that way will not cause the cd to show up under devices. I recommends using udisks2 to create a loop device:\nudisksctl loop-setup --file %f\n\n\nA: I made a custom action for thunar, based on qemu-nbd from qemu-img package of archlinux, it supports mounting images that qemu-img supports, i have tried those:\niso, img, vdi, qcow2, vhd, dmg, vmdk, parallels, bochs, vhdx\nusing zenity as gui, and pkexec to get privileges.\ncustom action script is like this:\nName: Mount disk image\nCommand:\nmounttarget=$(zenity --list --title=\"Mount target\" --width=200 --height=400 --column=device /dev/nbd{0..15});\n    if [ -n \"$mounttarget\" ]; then\n    ro=$(zenity --info --title \"Mount Setting\" --text \"Would you like to mount as read only or writable?\" --ok-label \"Read Only\" --extra-button \"Writeable\" --extra-button \"Cancel\");\n    if [ $? = 0 ]; then\n    pkexec sh -c \"modprobe nbd && qemu-nbd -c $mounttarget --read-only %f\";\n    elif [ \"$ro\" = \"Writeable\" ]; then\n    pkexec sh -c \"modprobe nbd && qemu-nbd -c $mounttarget %f\";\n    fi;\n    fi\n\nFile Pattern\n*.qcow2;*.vhd;*.vhdx;*.vmdk;*.img;*.vdi;*.iso;*.dmg\n\nBefore this, i have been using fuse or loopctl but they do not mount every iso as they sometimes have different formats inside them, i found out this method is reliable.\nTo unmount, i made another script that i launch from menu\nmounttarget=$(zenity --list --title=\"Unmount target\" --width=200 --height=400 --column=device /dev/nbd{0..15});\nif [ -n \"$mounttarget\" ]; then\npkexec sh -c \"qemu-nbd -d $mounttarget\";\nfi\n\nUnmount with this script is required if you are going to use the mounted file like qcow2 in a virtual machine.\n", "Q: KDE power management system could not be initialized First of all, apologies but I am very new to using kubuntu, so I would need a very basic step by step answer to solve this problem.

So I changed the 106 in passwd to be 115, rebooted, and that did it. Also, you may have noticed that other global services like udev don't work either. That prevents you from automounting USB sticks and it prevented my monitors from getting put in the right order on boot.

I installed Lubuntu 14.04 on my white MacBook 13''. Originally when running Mac OS X on a fully powered battery, while plugged to the AC, it would completely bypass the battery and run on the AC only. This was indicated by the magsafe light turning green. Does Lubuntu have the same powering behavior? As seen below the battery status says \"Adapter is online\", indicating it is using the AC I assume, but yet it says the battery is charging and the magsafe light is still red, indicating charging.

Then I installed Ubuntu, splitting it into two partitions (One for swap and the other for the Ubuntu file system).\nHowever, now whenever I attempt to boot via Windows Boot Manager(on /dev/sda2), I get the following error message:\n/EndEntire\nfile path: /ACPI(a0341d0,0)/PCI(2,1f)/Sata(0,0,0)/HD(2,1f4800,82000,0f6afd19c5af524e,2,2)/File(\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot)/File(bootmgfw.efi)/EndEntire\nerror: cannot load image.\n\nHow would I fix it so that Windows 8.1 can boot again as well?\n\nA: You can just install Ubuntu on virtual box or VM workstation. or you can turn your physical windows machine into a virtual one using VM workstation and can smoothly dual boot. One other thing that you can do (but i think it's too advanced is to try booting using V Sphere and then work on multiple OSs). I hope this info helps.\n", "Q: Mounting an USB will prevent viruses? Yesterday, I used dconf editor to prevent my laptop to automount an USB device. So, for example, if an USB had some Linux viruses (even if it's rare to find one), would it only activate if the USB were mounted?\nI will already say sorry is there was another thread that answered my question (I searched, but didn't find one)\nAnd, thank you for helping me.\n\nA: may be if you have autoplay enabled virus could affect your computer or if you transfer some data to your computer or run executable file, then only your computer be affected with virus.\nBest practise to disable autoplay in System Settings > Removable Media.\nBesides, there are only 100 or so viruses for linux. And changes of them to be distributed on internet is very very small, so don't be scared and keep your system up-to-date and disable autoplay\n\nA: Short answer\nUbuntu doesn't execute any software on external media unless you tell it to. It's perfectly safe to automatically mount any file systems you find.\nLong answer\nIt is theoretically possible to craft a file system that would trigger a bug in the file system driver and corrupt the kernel. It's also theoretically possible to craft the firmware of a USB device so that it corrupts the Linux USB stack as soon as you connect it and the computer starts to interact with it. Yet there are no (publicly) known vulnerabilities to any of the two, and if there were, it would be fixed almost instantaneously. You're relatively safe here and should focus your mitigation efforts on more likely attack vectors¹.\n¹ unless you run a nuclear energy facility in a Terrorist State™.\n", "Q: How to remove/uninstall OpenH264 plugin in Firefox 33? I don't want any plugins installed in Firefox. I always keep it plugin free.\nI just updated Ubuntu and it brought Firefox 33, which now has a plugin installed :( \nHow can I uninstall this plugin?\n\nA: I found the answer on Reddit. Many users experienced system crashes after updating to Gnome 3.14. They discovered that it was being caused by Firefox plugins (even when said plugins were disabled!). Uninstalling the plugins fixed the crashes.\nTo prevent the OpenH264 plugin, disable the about:config setting that allows it to be downloaded from the provider. This can be done by setting the following about:config setting to 'false':\nmedia.gmp-gmpopenh264.provider.enabled\n\nHere's a quick reference:\n1) open firefox\n2) in URL-bar, type 'about:config'\n3) search for media.gmp-gmpopenh264.provider.enabled\n4) double-click the entry to change its value to false\n\nA: Short answer\nYou can't, but you can disable it in the plug-in configuration pane.\nLong answer\nIf you really want to, you can find the relevant patches, revert them, and compile Firefox yourself. There may even be a build time configuration option to disable it.\n", "Q: Can't run apps without sudo I do my research and can't find anything useful, maybe I'm using the wrong keywords, nvm.\nif I try to run spotify for example I got \"Unable to initialize the storage of temporary files\" error, but if I go sudo spotify it works like a charm.\nSame thing on clementine got \"librarybackend attempt to write a readonly database unable to fetch row\" but if I run sudo clementine works great.\nNow I know the power of sudo so, how can make this work without typing sudo everytime?\nI was thinking adding to group users, but dunno how to do it or if it safe to do this, on the spotify folder y even chmod 777 the file but still doesn't work.\n\nA: I'd guess that at some point, files in your home directory became owned by root (because of misuse of sudo).

Because Wine relies on 32-bit libraries, you need to install the package for i386 architecture:\nsudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa:i386\n\nAlternatively you can install wine system-wide through the package manager instead of per user through POL. That will pull in the necessary libraries, since it depends on them:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nAll the *-dev packages are unnecessary and can be uninstalled unless you want to compile software based on those libraries.\n\nA: Alright this is how I solve this. Open your safari first before doing anything, go to preference > Security > default space for database storage and increase db storage option to maximum ie 500mb.\n\nHope this'll help someone.\n", "Q: Uninstalling GNS3 installed from source i installed GNS3 from source be executing 'setup.py install'.

I know that the Samsung Magician software drastically improves SSD performance, but have not been able to find a way of installing it to Ubuntu.  Has anyone been able to or know how to do this?\n\nA: Samsung (Disk) Magician is a firmware update tool to notify you about new firmware releases and installing them. The firmwares are also offered as ISO images on the Samsung website.\nComplementary features to the core functionality:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display S.M.A.R.T data and total bytes written\n\n*Run a non-comparable Samsung-specific benchmark\n\n*Run TRIM manually\n\n*Debatable Windows-specific \"OS Optimization\"\n\n*Customize Over Provisioning\n\n*Create media to execute Secure Erase\n\n*Setup RAPID Mode - a feature that may lead to data corruption or decrease in IOPS\n\n*Manage hardware encryption settings\n\n\nTo summarize: A bloated LCARS-like firmware updater with no secret sauce.\nIf you really want to install it, you can follow Brian Moths's answer. But the software does not seem to offer anything that you cannot do already on Ubuntu (other than Windows-specific features that would not work on Ubuntu anyway). It's simply a GUI.\n\n\nA: Installing Samsung Magican on Linux\nThere is something called samsung magician dc that you can install in linux. It can be downloaded from this link. The manual can be found in that dropdown list. Extract the tarball from the first link, and open the resulting folder. There will be two directories, 64-bit and 32 bit. Open the one corresponding to your operating system. The samsung magician executable is in this folder. The file is a simple binary so make it executable and run it.\nUsing Samsung Magician On Linux\nThe usage of samsung magician is described in the manual. Also some information on how to use the software can be obtained from sudo ./magician --help. One thing to know is that you pretty much always have to run magician as superuser. For example to list the samsung disks attached to your system you would use the command sudo ./magician -L There are many more operations desribed in the manual. \nInstalling firmware\nThe Samsung magician dc manual is vague on how to install firmware (specifically on how to lay out the directory containing the firmware). To see how to install firmware see this answer.\nPerfomance update\nThe 840 evo has a performance update which (I think) is independent from firmware and cannot be done with samsung magician dc. I think this performance update was the original goal of your question, so I will address it. The performance update can be found here. I have not done this update, but the installation guide is there.\n", "Q: After long run ubuntu 14.04 is running slow I have installed ubuntu 14.04 and its running good.

Let me explain the problem with an example. I use some old program in my day to day work, like for example xfig and pdfedit. \nNow, these programs are quite old and not updated too often; my fear is that one day or the other they will not work anymore for lack of some library or some incompatible update. \nIf the program is easy to compile now, on a running system, the solution is handy: try to hack a bit the source and compile it statically --- the resulting executable will be big and not so efficient, but it will work for the foreseeable future(1). This seem to be the case for xfig and I will try it as soon as possible. \nBut, for example, pdfedit depends on Qt3, and setting up a system to compile it is quite complex at this time. Fortunately it can be run right now, thanks to the fact that the library it needs do not conflict with anything. But this can change in the future, so I would like to solve this problem: \nHow can can I make a static binary (or similar thing) if I have a dynamic one and all the libraries, but no source code, on Ubuntu?\nI searched around. One possibility is statifier(2), but  it has a lot of problems with the address randomization, so it's a no-no. The non-free version, Ermine, seems to work, but I would really prefer an open source option. \nAnother possibility is to use docker or a similar packaging system. But all the tutorial I found are quite RedHat-oriented; and, honestly, quite complex to follow. \n\nFootnotes: \n(1) is not so crazy. I use a static ffmpeg for example, works ok and without any compatibility problems... \n(2) to compile statifier, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23498237/compile-program-for-32bit-on-64bit-linux-os-causes-fatal-error \n\nA: Opensource mkblob can make a new binary executable which includes all the dependencies your program needs and you will be able to distribute it to other (also later) distributions than the one it was compiled on. It works a little like Statifier and Ermine which was mentioned.\n\nA: You can solve your problem in another and more simple way:\nUse ldd on your executable to see the linked libraries, for example:\n$ ldd /bin/bash\nlinux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffb2fd4000)\nlibtinfo.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00007fac9ef91000)\nlibdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fac9ed8d000)\nlibc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fac9e9c6000)\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fac9f1e1000)\n\nThen collect all the libraries in a folder and set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable before running your program to point at this folder:\n$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/opt/my_program/lib\" /opt/my_program/start\n\nAlternatively you can add an entry for the lib folder to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/. But that would apply the change systemwide.\n\nA: One suggestion regarding statifier:  \nIf address space layout randomization (ASLR) is causing it to fail you don't have to turn it off for the whole machine. You can turn it off just for that process:\n$ setarch `uname -m` -R statified_pdfedit [args...]\n\nIt'll run that command with randomized layout disabled (no need to be root).\n\nA: I wrote packelf.sh based on Klaus D's idea.\nYou can use it like this:\n~ # packelf.sh `which perf` /root/perf\n~ # /root/perf --version\nperf version 3.10.0-1160.49.1.el7.x86_64.debug\n\npackelf.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -eo pipefail\n\n[ $# -lt 2 ] && {\n    echo \"usage: $0 <ELF_SRC_PATH> <DST_PATH> [ADDITIONAL_LIBS ...]\"\n    exit 1\n}\n\nsrc=\"$1\"\ndst=\"$2\"\nshift\nshift\n\ncat >\"$dst\" <<EOF\n#!/bin/bash\ntmp_dir=\"\\$(mktemp -d)\"\ncheck_path=\"\\$tmp_dir/__check_permission__\"\ntrap 'rm -rf \\$tmp_dir' 0 1 2 3 6\nif !

All of my function keys (F1-F12) have hotkeys bound to them (screen brightness, volume, etc.) but I want to be able to use the F keys without pressing Fn at the bottom of my keyboard. Basically, when I press F2, I want it to register as F2 and not as 'increase brightness.' Then I can use xbindkeys to make my own custom hotkeys. How can I do this?\n\nA: According to the HP support site, you can press F10 at some point during startup to access the BIOS settings. You should then be able to find a setting for this. The setting should be called \"Action Keys Mode\" and you want it to be disabled, but I can't say for sure if that's exactly how it works with your particular laptop.\nThere's a nice detailed guide on said support site:\nhttp://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02035108&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en&jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN\n\nA: This problem might be caused (and solved) outside of Ubuntu.\nOn some computers, there is a firmware setting--which may be enabled by default--to cause the numbered function keys at the top of the keyboard to take on their alternate actions when pressed by themselves (the actions ordinarily performed by pressing them while holding down Fn). If this setting is turned on, Fn must be pressed to make them act in the usual way, which appears to be the situation you're experiencing.\nI don't know of the HP Pavilion dv6 is one of the machines that offers that setting and ships with it enabled. (I recently observed this on a Toshiba Satellite C55-B5298, which I mention mainly for the possible benefit of Toshiba users who may find this by searching.) However, it is worth checking, and if that is the problem, there is an easy fix.\nTo check, enter your firmware (BIOS/UEFI) setup. There should be key you can hold down while turning on your computer that makes the computer run its firmware setup utility. Often this is F2. If not, the manufacturer documentation should tell you how.\nI believe this should work even if this is a UEFI machine that shipped with Windows 8/8.1. But if it doesn't, and you have Windows 8 or later installed, you should have another way to get into your computer's UEFI firmware setup. In Windows, click the shutdown icon, hold down Shift while clicking \"Restart,\" and select the option to enter the setup utility. The machine will shut down and boot automatically into the firmware setup. This method of entering the setup utility is explained in detail, with screenshots, in this answer by Luis Alavarado.\nOnce in the firmware setup utility, search for an option about function keys performing actions characterized with terms like alternate, alternative, special, function, etc. If you find it, turn it off, save your settings (the utility should present visible instructions about how to save you settings and exit), and see if that fixed the problem.\nI don't currently have access to the machine where I had this problem, to boot it back into its firmware setup utility and produce a more detailed description and/or screenshot. Anyway, that was a different brand and model from what you're using. So the more general description above might be more appropriate. In any case, anyone reading this who can improve these instructions or make them more detailed in a useful way should feel free to do so. That is the main reason I've made this answer community wiki.\n", "Q: Skype doesn't work in Ubuntu 14.04 I have ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed on my Dell PC but last time Skype didnt work under Ubuntu 14.04  LTS.

I installed Xubuntu from an .iso image.

Now that I have removed xubuntu and I am using ubuntu, shouldn't this file be gone? Shouldn't it be 10-ubuntu.conf instead?\nMy question is:\nWhat do the files under /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/ do?\nIs it safe for me to replace 10-xubuntu.conf with 10-ubuntu.conf?\n\nA: The contents of 10-xubuntu.conf are:\n[SeatDefaults]\nuser-session=xubuntu\n\nIn contrast, Ubuntu (that is to say, ubuntu-desktop) usually keeps configuration for LightDM in /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d, where you should find a 50-ubuntu.conf:\n$ cat /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf \n[SeatDefaults]\nuser-session=ubuntu\n\nIf this files exists, and has the same contents, you can go ahead and uninstall xubuntu-default-settings, the package that owns 10-xubuntu.conf:\nsudo apt-get purge xubuntu-default-settings\n\nThat would be cleaner than deleting or replacing 10-xubuntu.conf.\n", "Q: Where does the output of a script that was run at startup go?

Totem is not able to play one of them, issuing an exception; OpenShot also issues a warning when opening some of these videos cropped with Avidemux.\nMerging\nSo far I have tried this task with five different tools, all of which failed:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenShot - filled up 4 Gb of RAM and went on to fill 4 Gb of swap, at which point the system became unresponsive, forcing a reboot. In total the cropped avi videos add up to little over 200 Mb.\n\n*avimerge - produces a merged file without issuing warning or error messages but the image and sound are out of sync. There are moments where the sound played is from the parts cropped out in the previous step.\n\n*Kino - also produces a merged file without issuing errors but completely ravishes the image, it constantly flickers and jumps up and down, making it impossible to understand.\n\n*cat + mencoder - the end result has similar problems as with avimerge.\n\n*Avidemux - eventually found out it is also able to merge files, although the process is not obvious. The resulting videos yield sound and image out of sync; when opening a merged file with a player such as Totem, the length is about the double of what is reported by Avidemux.\nThe question\nAt this stage I strongly suspect something is going wrong upstream of the merging step, perhaps with the cropping (and thus the detailed story).\nMy question comes down to: how to perform these three apparently simple tasks with videos produced with RecordMyDesktop? I would appreciate suggestions either for a completely new processing pipeline or to changes in one of the steps. Comments from experienced RecordMyDesktop users are also welcome.\nUpdate I: included results of merge with cat and mencoder.\nUpdate II: included results of merge with Avidemux.\n\nA: Perhaps you are looking for different workflow.\nYou can first cut out the parts that you want with oggz-chop. Simply type in the terminal:\noggz-chop -o output.ogv -s start -e end input.ogv\n\nThis should give you good files that you want to keep. Make sure you name them in some sequential order, to be able to deal with them later.\nAfter that:\nThere is an oggCat command, which is able to concatenate two or more ogg files together producing one ogg file of the length equal to the sum of all provided.\nThe command line that will help you is:\noggCat output.ogv infile1.ogv infile2.ogv infile3.ogv ...\n\nDo not confuse it with another command from the same package titled oggJoin, which does something quite different, creating a single file with several streams that will run in parallel.\nNow, for cropping, i know that there is a way to do that losslessly, by editing the header of Theora stream, but i was unable to figure out how to do that as of yet. I will update the answer if i'll find the way.\n", "Q: Thunderbird with Lightning and Google provider no longer working? I'm using Thunderbird 31.1.12, Lightning 3.3.1 with Provider for Google Calendar 1.0.1 in Ubuntu 14.04\nWhen I try to add my google calendars, I select 'Create new calendar'> 'On my Network'> and select 'Google', I find that the location field disappears as soon as I select 'Google'.\nIn the next window it asks me to 'pick an existing session or a new session or enter your email address to create a new session'. This is not how it usually  functions, (or indeed how it functions on other platforms). Even if I enter my google address at that stage it doesn't successfully find my online calendar.\nIf anyone can shed any light on this I would be grateful as it's very frustrating at the moment.\nBest wishes and thanks!\n\nA: by chance I did that last night:\n-delete first the old \"network calendar(s)\"\n-choose new calendar\n-choose google\n-insert your email adress and your password\na window opens showing you your google calendars\n-choose the calendars you want to syncronize with Lightning\nDone\n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.04.1 youtube not working without html5 I've just installed Lubuntu 14.04.1 and when I tried to go to youtube I coudldn't read a video. \nI am using the firefox which is automatically installed when installing lubuntu , the shockwave flash 11.2.202.411 plugin is installed.\nI have installed pepperflashplugin-nonfree nothing changed. \nHere a screen of what I see when trying to read a video. \nhttp://imgur.com/A5uth7j\nThere is nothing, no play button, nothing telling me it can't read.\nHowever I just noticed it works fine when using the html5 option https://www.youtube.com/html5/\nIs there a problem with flash ? How can I fixed it ?\n\nA: A simple solution may be to install ubuntu-restricted-extras.  This should install various plugins and codecs that you may need to get going, all in one easy swoop.\nI suggest this because I've noticed an obtuse problem in your question, that you installed pepperflash to use with firefox.  pepperflash is for chromium only; firefox uses a different version of flash (flashplugin-installer).\nThere is back-story as to why chrome, chromium, and firefox each have different situations regarding flash, and different install procedures.  I suggest the u-r-e package if you want to not get into that.\n\nA: Install google-chrome-stable if firefox flash is not working, or you might wanna consider reinstalling firefox like mentioned this post and reinstall it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu MAAS DNS not forwarding request I am trying out MAAS but I am having trouble getting the node to reach the internet.  This is my setup:\n3 physical machine, with 1 of them having two network cards acting as gateway, cluster controllers and region controller.  The gateway/controller is setup to have one interface receive IP from the corporate network and while having the other managed by MAAS (both DHCP and DNS.)\nFrom the gateway, I have no problem reaching out, but the Nodes cannot.  I looked at the controller/gateway, I can see that bind9 is running.\n$ service bind9 status\n * bind9 is running\n\nDoing dig ubuntu.com give me results.  But if I do dig @127.0.0.1 ubuntu.com, I get no return.  I also look through the bind config and everything seems to be in order (forwarder is setup.)  What am I missing?\nHere are the relevant bind configs\n$ cat /etc/bind/named.conf\ninclude \"/etc/bind/named.conf.options\";\ninclude \"/etc/bind/named.conf.local\";\ninclude \"/etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones\";\n\n$ cat /etc/bind/named.conf.options\noptions { directory \"/var/cache/bind\";\ndnssec-validation auto;\ninclude \"/etc/bind/maas/named.conf.options.inside.maas\";\nauth-nxdomain no;\nlisten-on-v6 { any; }; };\n\n$ cat /etc/bind/maas/named.conf.options.inside.maas \n    forwarders {\n        172.24.3.136;\n    };\n\n\nA: Looks like the \"got insecure response\" is the issue.  Found this solution from StackOverflow:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/14923549/1692452\n\nThis is related to the new DNSSEC feature which is now enabled by default. This might indicate the DNS resolvers/forwarders you are using does not support DNSSEC so the response appear to be insecure to your server.\nYou can either use resolvers that support DNSSEC or temporarily disable the feature on your server. To disable it, simply use those parameters in your “named.conf” :\ndnssec-enable no; dnssec-validation no;\n\n\nA: Beside dnssec issues reported in the OP's answer (no valid RRSIG resolving ...), I also had issues with IPv6, which manifested themselves like so:\nmaas1 named[1532]: network unreachable resolving './NS/IN': 2001:503:c27::2:30#53\n\nThe solution was to start bind9 in v4 mode only.  To achieve this, I leveraged this article (I'm using MAAS 2.1 on Xenial, which is running systemd):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo systemctl cat bind9.service | grep ExecStart.  This provides the current cmdline used to start the bind9 daemon.\n\n*sudo systemctl edit bind9.service.  An empty editor appears which allows overriding the required aspects of the service definition.\n\n*Add the -4 flag to the ExecStart cmdline noted previously at save the file.  In my case it looks like this:\n[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStart=/usr/sbin/named -4 -f -u bind\n\n(NB: the first blank ExecStart= is intended - refer to the  aforementioned article).\n\n*If you'd like to check that your override is in place, you can re-run: systemctl cat bind9.service\n\n*systemctl restart bind9.service\n\n*Run a few requests from nodes and check all is good with: systemctl status bind9.service - previously this was chock full of the errors mentioned above.\n\n", "Q: Why does Xubuntu not shutdown, it just goes to the log in screen I'm running Xubuntu 14.04 and when I try to shut down or restart via the GUI, it just goes to the login screen. I know a lot of people seem to have a similar problem, but usually they can shut down once they reach the login screen. I cannot, instead all the options to shutdown, sleep, etc. are grayed out. Shutting down and restarting via the command line works fine.\nI've tried to edit my xinitrc file by adding the line ck-launch-session startxfce4\nwhich seems to be a fix for some people, but no luck...\n\nA: I experienced a similar problem, and I believe the issue was a configuration issue with lightdm.  Unfortunately, uninstalling lightdm does not remove all the configuration files.\nI recommend trying to remove all the lightdm.conf files, and any file with that in its name, and then reinstalling lightdm\nWhat I'm suggesting is risky!  If lightdm get's messed up, you won't be able to get back into a gui.  So I suggest this order:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall lightdm once, just to make sure it will work.\nThen, delete files and folders found by locate lightdm.conf that are in /etc and /usr.  NOT what is in /var/lib/dpkg/info\nLastly, sudo apt-get install --reinstall lightdm for real\nWhile I did experience this issue, I ended up solving it with a clean install, since I was experiencing other bugs as well.  So, I can't vouch for this solution.  Good luck.\n\nA: I found the problem. I've been messing with the files in /etc/pam.d in order to connect the xubuntu system to a domain and I had overwritten the information in /etc/pam.d/common-session.

I know how to partition a hard drive. I was think that if I make a /home partition that Steam and its data would be saved here. Right?\n\nA: Steam keeps all its data in your home folder (specifically, .local/share/Steam/), and uses the SteamApps directory within it for downloaded content (unless you configured it to use a different location. Since upgrading usually leaves your home folder untouched, Steam data should also be left untouched.\nYou can also make a separate partition for /home, but it would simpler to make Steam use a different location (on some other partition).\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK content window always on top Just getting started with the Ubuntu SDK, trying to get everything set up, and I'm running into a graphics bug that I can't find a resolution to, or even anyone else who seems to have the same problem. Basically, the main content window of the SDK (which I guess is actually Qt Creator) will not let ANYTHING draw over it, even when it does not have focus. It's even showing up on the lock screen. The closest I've found to the same problem is OpenGL windows always on top, but I'm not using Unity-2D, so I don't know where to go from here.\nThis is getting to the point of being unusable, as I can't even use things like the options menu for Qt Creator because it's drawing over those unless I move the window after opening the dialog so that it stops drawing over it.\nI'm running 14.04 LTS 64-bit, freshly installed on a VM inside Virtualbox within Mac OS X 10.9.5, with 3d acceleration enabled and functional, if that's any help.\n\nA: Unfortunatelly you should turn off 3d acceleration.

It is available through the software centre. It is a GUI for configuring external monitors. It will allow you to extend your laptop screen out to an external monitor and drag windows across. I have used it for my TV.\nGo to the software centre and search for ARandR. Download and open it. It should automatically detect any ext monitor that is plugged in. LVDS1 will probably be the name of your laptop screen, while VGA1 or HDMI1 will probably be the name of the ext monitor. You can position the ext monitor to any side of your laptop screen by clicking and dragging the appropriate monitor. Having them overlapping completely will have the same display showing on both monitors, while having them side by side will extend your usable space over the two monitors. You can even have them slightly overlapping if you so wish. Play around a little. Once you have gotten a configuration you like click the 'tick' symbol. and it will be applied.\nWhen using the system afterwards, should you wish to drag a window to the ext monitor, simply click on the titlebar and drag to the side of your laptop screen that you placed the ext monitor on and you will see your window begin to appear on the ext monitor.\n\nA: This is likely to be hardware-dependent, so your mileage may vary.\nMy hardware is:\nHP Zbook 14, with dual Intel and ATI Radeon HD 8730M GPUs. \n\nThe relevant lines of sudo lspci are\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 0b)\n03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Sorry for my probably very naive question.\nWhat I mean is: how to create an executable script/bash file that would run more complex commands, commands which must normally be put in a terminal?\nSpecifically, I am referring to the following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Learned about it from here:\n\n\n\nDRI_PRIME=1 glxgears -info\n\n\nThat would start glxgears and put to work the ATI discrete card.

I'm not interested in utilizing the HDD for anything but backup purposes, which I think differentiates it from some related questions that I've seen.\n\nA: No, there shouldn't be any adversary consequences of backing up to an additional hard drive (except increased energy consumption, wear, and decreased performance during backup of course).\nUnless you do something fancy (like some proprietary backup solutions), you'll be able to treat your backup drive as a regular storage medium with a common file system.

The \"Additional Drivers\" section only has version 331 which is outdated.\nFrom what I understand, NVIDIA has their own solution but it drains battery life. Ideally, I'd like to be able to just select which GPU I want to use to run a program just like in Windows.\n\nA: If you really want to use Bumblebee I suggest you follow the guide from the Ubuntu wiki, the basic steps are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the Universe and Multiverse repositories - you need to do\nthis to allow the bumblebee and nvidia packages respectively to be\ninstalled. \n\n*sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia primus\n\n*linux-headers-generic Reboot\n\n\nBut I would advise you to use the nvidia-prime solution, it delivers better performance in my experience and you can still choose which graphics card you want to use, though switching cards will log you out and you have to log back in.\nTo install nvidia-prime do the following:\nIf you have previously installed bumblebee you have to get rid of it:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get purge bumblebee*\n\n\nNow install nvidia-prime and the latest drivers (if you don't have them already):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install nvidia-prime\n\n*sudo apt-get install nvidia-340\n\n\nThat is how I got it working on my laptop.

I've used a bunch of commercial software for Windows that let me access my webcam remotely and even record while the LED light was off.\nI'm not paranoid, I'm just trying to retain the little of what rights I have left.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu can be compromised, as any other OS, trojans, phishing, social engineering, password cracking, browser exploits - all work in Ubuntu. \nThere is no policy of collecting the same amount of data as Windows 10 does (apparently, for developing purposes, which doesn't make it compromised in any way), and yet, there are Amazon adds in the dash - the feature some did call spyware.

However, my career as a freelancer will take a big turn in the near future, in that I'm going to get a VAT number and all this good stuff (wish me luck c: ) and this means that I'm going to keep a lot of important information on my computer, like Translation Memories, Glossaries, and so on. These files simply can't be lost if something goes awry: it takes years to get a proper glossary up and running and data lost is simply unacceptable, in this case. Thus, I'm going to build a new PC soon which will sport quite a big hard drive (I was thinking about a 1 TB drive, possibly split in a small partition just for the OS and a bigger one for data storage). I already have an older 80 gb SATA I drive from an old PC I had used until its motherboard fried and was thinking about using that as a backup device. Problem is, what will happen if the size of the backup exceeds the total space of the backup drive? Will Deja Dup just refuse to backup my system?\n\nA: First of all: Do not use the old hdd as a backup medium.\nReasoning\n\n*\n\n*Mainboard fried -> HDD possibly not 100% OK (depends on the reason the mainboard gave up)\n\n*HDD already has some hours on the counter and is likely to fail sooner than later\n\n*1TB of data will not even fit once on a 80GiB HDD, let alone multiple generations of backups or incrementals\n\nOther (important) information\nIn a case where backup is this important, meaning that your income depends on it, you need to do at least 2 things:\n\n*\n\n*Get some off-machine backup. Backing up to a HDD in the same computer is not a good idea. If lightning strikes then both disks are likely to take damage and you would be unable to recover. Backup to a dedicated backup PC that is only active when the backup actually runs. Protect both machines with a surge protector or UPS.\n\n*Get some off-site backup. Backing up to a medium that's kept in your house is a bad idea. In case of a fire, your backup will burn together with the main data. You would be unable to recover. Google \"offsite backup\" to find solutions.\n\n*Setup a backup solution in a way that it runs fully automated. Manual backup runs tend to not be made (\"I'll do it tomorrow syndrome\").\n\nSidenotes\n\n*\n\n*To find a backup solution that suits your needs, you also need to consider the time it takes to recover to a fully working system after a crash. If you need very fast restore, solutions that create images are likely to be better suited for you, but they have the downside that image backups are very large and space-inefficient.\n\n", "Q: Combining mouse buttons and keybord keys for hotkeys Question is about mouse buttons customization.\n I want ctrl, alt, shift to modify my mouse buttons behavior on being pressed.\nMy mouse have 9 buttons, prev, next buttons in it already working.\n I would like to configure my ubuntu to have:\n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl + prev mouse button = change virtual desktop to left\n\n*ctrl + next mouse button = change virtual desktop to right\n\n\nDoes such combinations possible to configure on Ubuntu or other OS?\nIf yes then how hard it will be?\nI have also one unused mouse button, is there any trigger like iterate next through workspaces?\nI am doing a lot o this switches.

In Ubuntu (actually, Debian and most Debian derivatives), /bin/sh is not linked to /bin/bash, but to /bin/dash, which doesn't support many bash-specific features, but is considerably faster.\nOn Arch Linux:\n$ ls -l /bin/sh\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Sep 28 15:26 /bin/sh -> bash\n\nOn Ubuntu:\n$ ls -l /bin/sh\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Feb 19  2014 /bin/sh -> dash\n\nThe right thing to do\nIf you use a shebang, mean it. Since your script contains bash-isms, use /bin/bash in the shebang. Or write portable, POSIX-compliant code.\nYou can speed up this process by using the checkbashisms program mentioned in this LWN article. It's part of the devscripts package, so install it first:\nsudo apt-get install devscripts\n\nThus:\ncheckbashisms /path/to/script.sh || sed -i '1 s;/bin/sh;/bin/bash;' /path/to/script.sh\n\nYou can convert this to a script (say convert.sh):\n#! /bin/sh\n\nfor i\ndo\n    checkbashisms \"$i\"\n    if [ $? = \"1\" ]\n    then\n        sed -i '1 s;/bin/sh;/bin/bash;' \"$i\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nThe specific return code of 1 means that checkbashisms found a possible bashism, and other return values indicate other problems (file not readable, missing shebang, etc.), so we can check for that particular return value.\nAnd then call it with:\n./convert.sh /path/to/first/script.sh /path/to/second/script.sh\n# or \n./convert.sh *.sh\n# or\nfind . -iname '*.sh' -exec ./convert.sh {} +\n\nThe wrong thing to do\nReplace /bin/sh with a symbolic link to /bin/bash.\nRecommended reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bashism - compares bash and dash syntax and shows changes needed.\n\n*Dash as /bin/sh - similar.\n\n\nA: In my case the problem was the export of IFS variable definition in ~/.bashrc (~/.profile)  \n#Loop over filenames with spaces\nexport IFS=$'\\n'\n\nWhen changed to either\nexport IFS=$' \\t\\n'  #default according to man dash\nor\nIFS=$'\\n'\n#!/bin/sh scripts started working again. In the latter case the definition no longer propagates to forked /bin/sh processes. The meaning of IFS is explained here and setting it to '\\n' causes problems in scripts interpreted by dash shell, which may be the default shell /bin/sh -> dash linked to in your distribution (e.g. debian).\n", "Q: (Auto) Run xrandr on login?

Disconnect ANY other hard drives from the installing system, install as normal, then replace drive into the laptop.  As long as you installed the version for the correct architecture (x86 vs amd64) you should be good to go.  \nIf you do not have the capability to install the hard drive into another machine, but can connect it externally via a USB adapter, you can usually install to a USB attached disk as well.

I have moved to a hostel and they provide WiFi network. I would like to be safe on that public WiFi network. Is there any way to encrypt my data transmission to and from the router ? I am a bit consumed by the hype of “How unsafe public WiFi is” slogan. \n\nA: Remote access\nMost public wireless access points (encrypted or not) use client isolation so there's no way another network client can communicate with your device. If clients can communicate, just make sure to (temporarily) disable or secure all network services running on you device (like httpd, ftpd, sshd, smbd), as you will likely not need them during your stay in the hostel anyway. If you consider yourself a “layman“ as per your comment, you don't need to worry, because Ubuntu doesn't have any network services enabled by default. Of course a more savvy friend could have enabled them per your request, but I suspect you would know about that.\nWireless packet sniffing\nSince the network is encrypted with WPA2, an encryption protocol without publicly known vulnerabilities, you're safe from wireless packet sniffers too, because the wireless access point assigns a different session key to every client. Even if all clients share the same password, they won't be able to decrypt each other's network traffic (with reasonable effort). This part is only true for WPA2-EAP.\nI have since learned that an attacker with knowledge of the pre-shared secret (likely for a semi-public wireless network) and a record of the WPA2-PSK authentication handshake (reauthentication can be provoked with a deauthentication attack which only requires knowledge of the PSK) can decrypt all subsequent traffic.\nConclusion: Don't rely on the privacy of public wireless networks encrypted with a pre-shared secret. Refer to the following sections for solutions.\nUpstream wire tapping\nIf you're concerned that the hotel staff abuses their access to the unencrypted “upstream“ network (i. e. between the wireless access point (AP) and their internet service provider (ISP)), you need to use HTTPS/TLS¹ or a VPN to encrypt your network traffic throughout that section depending on you needs. See my first comment for things to consider and update your question accordingly, so I can go into the correct details.\nVPN\nTo set up a VPN you need to find a VPN provider that offers VPN protocols with Linux support – preferably with setup instructions, even better when they're for Ubuntu. An alternative would be a public peer-to-peer based VPN like Tor or I2P. Find or ask another question if you encounter problems with either of those, since this would lead a bit too far from the original question.\n¹ Most popular web sites use HTTPS by default or optionally to protect against session stealing and man-in-the-middle attacks. Many more do so at least during authentication to protect your password.\n\nA: One possible idea, may not be a \"solution\" for the question you are asking, is to use a different approach to accessing the internet:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a VPN service that maintains anonymity. One can look for Hotspot Shield or alternatives for Ubuntu. Is there a free VPN service that works on Ubuntu?\n\n*Install VirtualBox with Tails Linux, where-in you are running an OS, that focuses on anonymity, as Virtual Machine on Ubuntu. In my experience, VirtualBox works like a charm on 14.04, though I have not tried Tails.\nAs for \"letting other users in\", you need to install latest security-updates and ensure proper firewall set-up.. .but this is more about general network-security and not specifically about \"your activities\".\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Seeing as nobody else has provided this as an answer, I think it's time to recommend Tor. What Tor offers is fairly robust security by routing your outbound traffic through a whole bunch of computers. Tor is not the be-all and end-all of security, however. What it will do is encrypt your outbound traffic to the network itself.\nWhat this means is that your outbound packets (what you send out) won't be able to be read by anyone intercepting the traffic at that end. They have no way to control traffic beyond an exit node, however.\nHere is a good rundown on the whole process - note the first answer. Here's the gist of it but I encourage you to go to the site and actually read the entire question and the various replies to it. It's well worth knowing this information as it may come in handy in a variety of ways. Here you go:\nYour connection into the Tor network itself is encrypted, as are connections between Tor nodes. In fact, each hop is encrypted with a new key to avoid back-tracing.\n\nWhat might be unencrypted is the connection from your Exit Node onto the web, if you're connecting over an unencrypted protocol. This means that if you're viewing a standard HTTP webpage then the final Tor node in your circuit and their ISP can see the unencrypted data, but they won't be able to trace it back to its origin (unless that data contains anything personally identifying you).\nNow there are a lot of ways to get Tor running but, frankly, the easiest way that I can think of is to simply go here and download the appropriate version for your computer (32 or 64 bit). \nWhat Tor is not - Tor is not something you use to download large files, it's not something you download torrents with either. Tor is meant to, mainly, stay on the .onion networks but can be used like a proxy server to browse the web. This is not completely secure from someone who's able to use traffic packet shaping/modeling attacks and timing attacks. If they can see the shape of your packet entering the network and control an outbound node then they can determine where you went. This doesn't really apply to your situation, however.\nIf you want an additional way to install Tor and to keep it updated, this is how you do it for the latest release:\nYou need to add the following entry in /etc/apt/sources.list or a new file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/:\ndeb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org utopic main\n deb-src http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org utopic main\nThen add the gpg key used to sign the packages by running the following commands at your command prompt:\ngpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89\n gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -\nYou can install it with the following commands:\n$ apt-get update\n $ apt-get install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring\nIf you need more information then please see this site but the above directions should remain stable and unchanged for the foreseeable future.\n\nA: All you need is a VPN service. I personally recommend IPvanish which is a VPN service with a lot a servers in Europe, especially in Germany. It´s very fast and very reliable. Here is a link from a review of the service: https://anonymweb.de/ipvanish-vpn-im-test/\n\nA: If you are worried about privacy from others on the wireless (which you should be) you can be using a VPN like cyberghost. You should also have a strong firewall like zonealarm\nIf you are using WPA2 or not if the attacker is on the wireless they can still access the package data, I am not sure why it is said you can't. I am not going to get in to that here.\nThe best option is using a strong firewall and vpn at the same time. That will keep others out of your computer, and your packet data encrypted with a software program other than that of the router itself.\n", "Q: How can I use Wine in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions?

I have seen some computer experts using terminal which is having lots of colored text and all. Actually how many types of terminals are there in Ubuntu?\n\nA: I have found the answer here. May the way I asked the question was little confusing. I was actually looking for terminal emulators. But before I read this, I never knew that there are emulators exist for terminal.\nThere are a number of terminal emulators available for Linux and so for Ubuntu which give more usability based on your application. Usability in the sense, for example, there is a terminal emulator which shows the thumbnails when you list the files under a directory using ls command. There is another terminal emulator called Terminator in which you can split your window horizontally and vertically o that you can evaluate all you activities in the same screen without switching the tab.\nThe one I prefer for my application is Terminator as I have to perform more than one processes on my terminal, like I have to run a scan on a server and at the same time I want to edit a file using vim.

I did a stupid thing. I was having issues with certain files in my trash that my system was not allowing my to delete, meaning I could no longer empty my trash.

How can I restore my trash once again? I know it's probably as simple as re-creating the file, but I'm unsure of the terminal language to do this.\nThanks in advance.\nTL;DR I removed my trash directory with sudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*and need help getting it back/making a new one.\n\nA: Try: \ncd ~\nmkdir .local/share/Trash\nmkdir .local/share/Trash/expunged\nmkdir .local/share/Trash/files\nmkdir .local/share/Trash/info\nchmod -R 700 .local/share/Trash\n\n... and then restart nautilus with nautilus -q. I am not sure it will work, it is just recreating the structure I have with an empty trash; you can safely ignore error about existing directory. \nNotice, no sudo here. The trash is yours, should be manageable without superuser privileges; as a general rule, you should never use sudo to manage file in your home directory --- unless you have to fix previous sudo usage, that is. \nIf you have messed with superuser in this dirs, you may need to fix the ownership...\nsudo chown -R myuser .local/share/Trash\n\nWhere myuser is your normal user, of course.\nAnd BTW, the \"not erasable file\" was probably a file in another partition. \n\nA: I had a similar problem in Ubuntu 14.04 : Thrash opened, but it was not possible to delete anything from it.

How can I fix this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Edit the file ~/.vmware/preferences and look for a line that starts with mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers, if it is not present - you can add it into the file. \nThis should be changed to mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = \"TRUE\" \n(note the double quotes around TRUE)\n\nA: Add mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = \"TRUE\" in the .vmx file.\nIt has worked for Linux Mint Cinnamon as host with kernel 3.16 and Debian 8.2 Cinnamon as guest.\n\nA: For me, I had to add mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = \"TRUE\"to my virtual machine (.vmx) file\n\nA: If you are using dual graphics cards, the warning implies that the independent graphics card is not available for VMware. Setting mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers indeed solves the problem, but a better way to solve this is to run VMware via:\noptirun /usr/bin/vmware\n\nOr, for convenience, you can change your .desktop file and use /usr/bin/optirun /usr/bin/vmware %U as the command.\nThis solution provides better performance.\nSee https://www.tiger2doudou.com/doku.php?id=linux:tools:virtualize:vmware_3d_hw_acceleration_with_bumblebee\n\nA: on Debian 10 we face the some problem, we solve it by adding the mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = \"TRUE\" \nto the vkx file\n\nA: For me (Ubuntu 18.04, Intel graphic, VMware v16, Windows10), to activate 3D acceleration it was necessary to add mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = \"TRUE\". I have choosed to add this to my virtual machine (.vmx) file.\nWithout this, if 3D acc. is activated, W10 login screen, text and icons on popup notification and menus are totally not readable! All works fine if 3D acc. is not activated\nAfter some hours : eclipse repeatedly freeze while debugging java application, task manager : csrss.exe process consuming #10% CPU.\n3D acc. disactivated => same problem\nmks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = \"TRUE\" deleted => OK\nSo don't use mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = \"TRUE\"\n", "Q: Fundamental difference between a Ethernet (networking) driver and a pcie driver May be its a dumb question but can somebody explain the fundamental difference when you say a pcie or a Ethernet drivers.

Thanks in advance\n\nA: PCIe is used to communicate with your local network card. The actual network card uses the ethernet protocol to communicate with external network devices. These protocols can also be used within the OS to emulate such devices as well.\nHere is an extremely basic graphical depiction that I put together for you:\n\nAdditionally, please note that ethernet is indeed a protocol and not a type of device. For instance, both fibre interfaces and rj45 copper cable interfaces can run via ethernet protocol, to name just a couple.\nTCP/UDP stack is handled by the kernel/OS entirely, not by the hardware in between.\n\nA: While this is off topic…\nPCI Express\n… is a machine bus interface for very high throughput, very low latency communication between internal and, more recently, peripheral computer hardware components.\nEthernet\n… is a networking protocol usually used in interfaces with high throughput, low latency communication between computers in a local area network. It is not restricted to particular routing or connection layer protocols on top of it like IP, TCP and UDP.\nAn Ethernet adapter device may be connected to the rest of a computer by a PCI Express bus.\n", "Q: Text file viewer that automatically refreshes when file changes?

I need Netbeans to develop software so I decided to install the 8.0.1 version. Since the pkg installer doesn't have the latest version, I downloaded the .sh file from the Official Site. Thus I install it in a very simple way, putting it in /usr/local directory as well.\nNow there is a problem, typing \"netbeans\" in bash doesn't work and it says:\nThe program 'netbeans' is currently not installed. \nYou can install it by typing:    \n\nsudo apt-get install netbeans\nOf course, with the suggested command I will install the old version of the program, instead of the 8.0.1 one. \nDespite that, typing \"netbeans\" in the ubuntu search bar works without mistakes.\nHow can fix this problem? Should I install the program in another directory?\nThanks for your kindness.\n\nA: The script that you dropped into /usr/local is not a usable netbeans application but rather an install script for it. Move it back into your home directory somewhere and following the installation instructions found here:\nNetbeans IDE - Installation Instructions\n\nA: /usr/local/ itself isn't in the default path, /usr/local/bin is.\nMove your launch script there and it should be picked up.\n\nIn your case, you're installing the entire thing into /usr/local/netbeans-<VERSION>/. This includes a launcher script in ./bin/netbeans. The simple fix for you is to just symlink to that launcher from somewhere in the path:\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/netbeans-8.0.1/bin/netbeans /usr/local/bin/\n\nThen netbeans will launch that script.

However, I was finding that I was unable to hibernate if I had more than 3GB of RAM in-use.

I'd like to be able to store family pictures and other things I'd want backed up. So I had considered an OS disk alongside a hardware RAID 1 configuration, so three disks in total, the 2nd and 3rd being a mirror of each other.\nWith hardware RAID, I believe that I'd loose the ability to pull out a surviving disk and plug it into another machine to read/backup the data on it (say my hardware RAID controller goes bust). To get around that I'd considered software RAID.\nI'm wondering if there are any other options that I've missed that could provide the mirroring that I want?\n\nA: There are many distributed file systems available for Linux. These are more geared towards server applications like cloud computing, and include the ability to mirror data between computers as well.\nFree options include Lustre and GlusterFS.\nUsing software RAID is probably the most common way to do what you want though.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu support my machine features? I'm looking to download and install the latest version of Ubuntu to replace the current version of Windows I had pre-installed on my machine when bought it. \nI have some really neat features on the machine that I really am hoping will still work when I move over to Ubuntu.\nCan someone please confirm if the below will still work and, if not, how I can get them to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB ports on my machine\n\n*The ethernet or Network work port on the machine\n\n*The HDMI output on the machine\n\n*and finally, the built in webcam\n\n\nThanks\nSam\n\nA: Generic Answer:\nIn general, all of those things are fairly well supported by popular Linux distributions such as Fedora and Ubuntu. \nIf you wish to get a good idea of how well Ubuntu will run on your hardware prior to actually trying it, you could just use a search engine like Google or Yahoo to search specific hardware components for known incompatibilities.\nIf something is going to be an issue out of that list, it will most likely be the HDMI output or webcam. USB ports and wired networking devices do not tend to experience functionality issues with the Linux kernel.\nBest Option (imo):\nOne route you could go is to try Ubuntu on live CD or USB-drive and test all of these functions out yourself before installing.

Foremost seems to have recovered most of my photos, probably 1500 of them.  But it must have found recovered a bunch of other (garbage) photos as well.  Also foremost doesn't preserve directory structure.  The result is that I now have 46,000 photos in one folder all with generic names such as 10202537827.jpg.\nProblem:\nNow when I try to navigate to that folder in Nautilus it just churns the disk for a few hours then never shows me any file listing or thumbnails in the folder.  I thought Nautilus saved photo thumbnails in a folder called .cache/thumbnails.\nQuestion:\nIs my Nautilus in a rut somehow where it tries to recreate all the thumbnails each time I open the folder?  Or is it walking all the photos to try to resync them with the .cache/thumbnails folder?  Does anyone know any strategy for managing 46,000 photos in a GUI navigator?  I definitely need the thumbnails to be able to sift thru 46,000 photos and find the 7% of them that are mine and discard the leftover photos from this disk's previous life.\n\nA: You are correct, Nautilus will cache the thumbnails so it doesn't have to re-create them each time it displays them. However, keep in mind that:\n\n\n*\n\n*It will take a lot of time to create thumbnails for 46,000 images, especially if there are many large images\n\n*If it doesn't finish creating all thumbnails, it will re-start the next time you view the folder\n\n*Nautilus is going to be a bit slow loading a directory with 46,000 files of any type, let alone images that need thumbnailing\n\n\nBecause of this I would suggest using a different program for this task. I have found that Gthumb does a better job than Nautilus when working with a bunch of photos. The catalog view lets you see all of the thumbnails, and you can open a photo for a closer look. It is still usable while generating thumbnails in the background. Listing that many files to begin with will still take a while though.\nAnother option is trying some alternate file browsers.\nLastly, you could run a script to divide the files into subfolders to make it more manageable.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts for spatial navigation between open windows (Switch to the window to the left/right/top/bottom of the current one) Is there a program or utility that would let me map keyboard shortcuts for switching between open windows according to their relative placement on the screen? For example: I have three windows, one on the left, one on the right and one below them. The top-left one is currently focused. I press Win + → (for example) and the focus jumps to the window to the right. Then I press Win + ↓ and the focus jumps to the bottom window. You get the idea.\nSo, is there an utility for that? Or perhaps some settings in Ubuntu or Compiz? I don't seem to find anything like it.\nFor me, this would be much more usable than switching with Alt + Tab.\nAlso, I don't want to use a tiling window manager. I'm quite happy with unity. Just having this spatial navigation on top of it would be great.\n\nA: Even after some quite extensive googling, I couldn't find anything like this, so I threw together my own solution: Spatial Window Switcher. It is very simple and probably has bugs, but so far fulfills my needs.\n\nA: Neither I found something useful for Lubuntu. So I ended up with my own small WindowsSwitcher\nNow to navigate to the necessary windows it's enough to click  Windows+1, Windows+2 and so on.\n", "Q: Could I recompile php after install with apt-get? the title says a lot I guess, I want to install my lamp serve with:\napt-get install lamp-server^\n\nAnd after that I want to recompile the php to add the pthreads, \nit is possible install the lamp server without install all server from the source?\n\nA: Install the various utilities needed\nsudo apt-get install apache2-dev apache2 build-essential\n\nThen compile PHP as-per instructions at http://php.net/manual/en/install.unix.apache2.php with any modifications you desire.\nI'd recommend keeping the source in /usr/src so that you can recompile and relink apache anytime you apt-get update apache, (as you may have to recompile your version of PHP to ensure the versions match up).

For a typical home PC the security situation is following:\n\n\n*\n\n*No servers running, not even the SSH. Firewall is ufw running in simple mode: all outgoing allowed, all incoming denied. Torrents and DC++ may be. May often be behind a router without port forwarding. \n\n*All sensitive or valuable information already available for read and write for the user and resides in his /home\n\n*Physical presence of attacker is impossible. (by impossible I mean that if attacker is present near PC, the PC is a least concern in situation). \n\n*Being a specific target of skilled attacker is astronomically improbable.\n\n*DE with autologin enabled. \n\n\nQuestion: In the situation described, what vectors of attack there are, in which the strength of user password is relevant? Can, for example, a malicious web site has a chance to attempt bruteforcing? If, for example, user runs a malicious script, would it not be much easier for it to put itself in autorun and wait for user to use sudo than do bruteforcing? Why would it need root at all - all fun things are already available?\nI want to make a weighted decision about the password length. I am actively converting people to Linux and typing passwords scares them.  Typing secure password a lot annoys me too. It is just stupid to have a password when nobody will ever try to force it or steal hash. \n\nA: Not a lot. A threat might be a malicious website that installs software on your system that includes something that probes for your sudo password and sends it out to the world. But modern browser will prompt you if something tries to install software. And the average Linux user tends to be more informed than the average Windows users. Plus there is also the idea that we should know where to go and where not to go. In general Linux users do not download from random websites. We use the repositories and can assume these are safe. \nAddition: if you want to convert users to Linux there is one thing you should teach these users. Force them to use the Ubuntu software center and warn them not to search for installation files on the web. The biggest reason for virusses on windows is the fact of visiting nasty websites and downloading malicious installation files. Using Ubuntu software center will reduce that risk a lot.\nJust an idea: the one big threat we have is when someone manages to install corrupted software into the Ubuntu repositories. If someone gets something malicous accepted into the repositories like an altered chrome or firefox we are all screwed. Is that likely to happen? Naaa. \nEven running local services would not matter. A local webserver with no outside connection enabled (ie. running on localhost) will be safe. Only if you run it not local you will be taking a risk: the scripts created to run your website might be flawed. But I would not call that a home computer anymore.\nYour 1st and best safeguard on a home system is your router. \nAnd if you are scared it is always the better option to make regular backups where you detach that harddisk from your system when not making backups. \nIf an attacker has physical access you are in trouble on a normal system. 1 reboot into a live dvd and your sudo password can be changed. Encrypting the disk would be an option. But that will not prevent a formatting.\n\nA: Attack vectors: \n\n\n*\n\n*Behind a NAT router (most are nowadays) fat chance of anyone getting in. And ufw running as well: even less chance...  Without a NAT router: it's just software, not hardware.  Software can be hacked especially if automatic updates are off.\n\n*Physical access: Indeed, you're right. the password is the least of your concerns while the attacker is there.  However if he steals the computer, it is nice to know that none of your data can be seen by the thief. (encrypted home directory minimum, or better: full truecrypt). These people don't have technical skills and an encrypted computer is worth less on the black market.\n\n*LAN: Well, if you're not going to enter any password on the PC why protect the WiFi then?  Open it all up!  >:) Put the router in the corridor so people can plug in their LAN cables while you're at it!  ;)  :D\n\n*\"Easy-to-guess-passwords\":\nDefinitely avoid Your country's top 100 passwords\nI told my mother to use the name of the street she lived in as a child (not really but something as easy for her to remember) and then add 4 exclamation marks...  She actually likes typing her password.  :-)\n\n*To know how security-conscious people are, ask them the following two questions:\nA. Do you close your front door with a key?\nB. Do you close your curtains?\nIf the answer to both questions is \"No\", then don't give them any password, but if one of the questions is answered by \"yes\", help them protect themselves by giving them a long password!

In Windows I am familiar with .exe and .dll files (two essential files for running or writing a program). But when I want to install manually an application in Ubuntu, most of the time I will need extra packages. What are these packages? Are they like dll files in Windows? Where are they save in Ubuntu? What types of packages are there? How can I find what packages are needed to install an application and where can I find them?\n\nA: \nWhat are these packages? \n\nConsider this real life example of what a package is: packages are what UPS delivers on your doorstep: exactly that what you ordered from somewhere packaged neatly collected in 1 box. \nAn Ubuntu package is exactly that: a collection of items (scripts, libraries, text files, a manifest, license, etc) that enable you to install a piece of software ordered in such a way that the package manager can unpack it and put it into your system.\n\nAre they like dll files in Windows? \n\nNo the equivalent of a DLL would be what we call a library. Those will be inside the package.\n\nWhere are they save in Ubuntu? \n\nIn a cached directory. See /var/cache/apt/archives/\n\nWhat types of packages are there? \n\nTechnically there is just one. We use \".deb\" files. Redhat uses \".rpm\". Suse uses \".rpm\". We can use \".rpm\" by converting it into a \".deb\" but that is for the more experienced user (I have been using Ubuntu since the beginning and I rather spent 10 more minutes searching for a .deb). There are other methods of installing but a installation files that are zipped (like a .tar file) are not a package. \n\nHow can I find what packages are needed to install an application and where can I find them?\n\nYou can use your own Ubuntu software center to search for software based on text. If you are interested in an on-line method where you can also find the debian installation package and all of the source files: ubuntu.packages.com \nMind you: you technically do not need to know what you need to install. The system itself know what to install (including dependencies related to that package you choose).\n\nEdit based on comments:\nThe intriguing part of this question starts to show. The android SDK is not an Ubuntu package so the common Ubuntu rules do not apply. It is 3rd party software, and it is offered as a general Linux ZIP file. Those can be annoying in that they often only tell you you need other software. And often put those requirements in a text file (a \"readme\"). \nEclipse and Aptana are similar: they require java but do not install it for you. They put a notice with the download though that you need java. It is up to you to install a java version (since there are more than one).\n", "Q: Convert mkv to ogv How to convert mkv file (with multiple audio track) to ogv format by presrving all the audio track?\nIs it possible to create a ogg file (audio) with multiple track?\n\nA: In Linux, you have a universal media conversion program called avconv (alternatively ffmpeg). In basic form it is controlled by extensions, so \navconv -i input.mkv output.ogm will do the proper conversion. \nHowever, to preserve all streams, you need to use -map option. Let me just cite the manual:\n-map [-]input_file_id[:stream_specifier][,sync_file_id[:stream_specifier]] | [linklabel] (output)\n           Designate one or more input streams as a source for the output file. Each input stream is identified by the input file index input_file_id and\n           the input stream index input_stream_id within the input file. Both indices start at 0. If specified, sync_file_id:stream_specifier sets which\n           input stream is used as a presentation sync reference.\n\n           The first \"-map\" option on the command line specifies the source for output stream 0, the second \"-map\" option specifies the source for output\n           stream 1, etc.\n\n           A \"-\" character before the stream identifier creates a \"negative\" mapping.  It disables matching streams from already created mappings.\n\n           An alternative [linklabel] form will map outputs from complex filter graphs (see the -filter_complex option) to the output file.  linklabel\n           must correspond to a defined output link label in the graph.\n\n           For example, to map ALL streams from the first input file to output\n\n                   avconv -i INPUT -map 0 output\n\n           For example, if you have two audio streams in the first input file, these streams are identified by \"0:0\" and \"0:1\". You can use \"-map\" to\n           select which streams to place in an output file. For example:\n\n                   avconv -i INPUT -map 0:1 out.wav\n\n           will map the input stream in INPUT identified by \"0:1\" to the (single) output stream in out.wav.\n\n           For example, to select the stream with index 2 from input file a.mov (specified by the identifier \"0:2\"), and stream with index 6 from input\n           b.mov (specified by the identifier \"1:6\"), and copy them to the output file out.mov:\n\n                   avconv -i a.mov -i b.mov -c copy -map 0:2 -map 1:6 out.mov\n\n           To select all video and the third audio stream from an input file:\n\n                   avconv -i INPUT -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 OUTPUT\n\n           To map all the streams except the second audio, use negative mappings\n\n                   avconv -i INPUT -map 0 -map -0:a:1 OUTPUT\n\n           Note that using this option disables the default mappings for this output file.\n\nSo you will need this:\navconv -i nput.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a output.ogm\n\nAnd yes, you can store multiple tracks, and even video and text, in OGG file, because it is a universal media container. \n\nA: You can use dmMediaConverter and in Convert mode and put ogg  or ogv extension in the output file like audio.ogg. Also, uncheck \"Enable\" on video stream it is audio only. You can copy the streams if them are accepted by this container. h264/h265/vp8/vp9 is not accepted by ogg.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*First use ffmpeg to identify the audio stream encoding. \n\n*Then use ffmpeg to extract the audio stream (in original encoding).\n\n*Then, if you really want you could re-encode it to ogg.\nBut it might be most useful to keep the original audio encoding.\n\n*First use ffmpeg to identify the audio stream encoding. \n$ ffmpeg -i $f\n\nStream #0:0(und): Video: h264 (Main), yuv420p, 640x480 [SAR 1:1 DAR 4:3], 29.97 fps, 29.97 tbr, 1k tbn, 59.94 tbc\nStream #0:1(eng): Audio: opus, 48000 Hz, stereo, s16 (default)\n\n\n*Then use ffmpeg to extract the audio stream (in original encoding to .mka format).\nffmpeg -i song.mkv -acodec: copy -vn song.mka\n\nI found this useful:\nhttp://www.hecticgeek.com/2012/12/extract-audio-using-ffmpeg-ubuntu/\nAnd this is a really good tip:\n\nNote: Whenever you are in doubt (don’t know what extension to use),\n  then you can simply use the ‘.mka’ extension (‘output.mka‘). Because\n  ‘MKA’ container format can store a huge number of audio codecs. If you\n  choose that however, then some players might not be able to play the\n  audio track. So please be aware of that.\n\nA useful script to convert any mmv and mp4 to mka audio (keeping original audio encoding): convert_vtoa.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor f in *.mkv *.mp4; do \n    # ffmpeg -i $f\n    bn=${f%%-[A-Za-z0-9]*}\n    echo -n bn=$bn\n    if [[ ! -e \"$bn.mka\" ]] ; then\n        echo ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -acodec: copy -vn \"$bn.mka\"\n        ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -acodec: copy -vn \"$bn.mka\"\n    else \n        echo \"      ##### already done. #####\"\n    fi\ndone\n\n", "Q: How do I disable the default Broadcom Wireless driver in favor of a Windows driver I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit and I'm trying to get my Cisco AE2500 USB wireless receiver to pick up the wireless signal.  Initially during the install of Ubuntu onto my system I had it connected via ethernet to download all the updates.  After rebooting and getting into Ubuntu for the first time, my wireless worked but is getting really bad signal even for sitting right next to the router.  If I move the computer back to where it was originally, no signal will reach it.\nI've come to find out that it's using my on-board wireless device which I never officially set up because I didn't have the hardware, more specifically, the antenna which it needed.  This also explains why I'm getting bad signal even when sitting close to it.\nOn a previous install, I was able to get my AE2500 to work but I was never able to connect to anything, despite being able to see the networks.  On this install, since I actually did the updates this time around, it's using Broadcom drivers for my onboard networking card.  When using the NDISWrapper GUI (ndisgtk) I try to use the XP driver set which was valid on my last install but now is saying \"Invalid Driver!\" with a big red X across it.  My guess is that it is thinking this driver is trying to be applied to my on-board network card and not my USB device.  \nIs there anyway I can choose or make default, this AE2500 device and disable the on-board card so there is no conflict?  I tried the \"Additional Drivers\" and I see the Broadcom driver and I attempt to disable it.  When I hit \"Apply Changes\", it reverts back to what it had.  I thought maybe there is a dependency since I was connected via wifi, so I plugged the ethernet cord in, rebooted, and it still won't allow me to remove it.\nI'm up for any ideas at this point.  \n\nA: I suggest you run, in a terminal:\nsudo lshw -C network\n\nFind the driver for the internal (Broadcom?) device. Then unload and blacklist its driver. lshw will report, for Broadcom devices, either 'driver=wl0' or 'driver=b43-pci-bridge.' The relevant drivers to be blacklisted are wl or b43. Assuming it is wl, for example:\nsudo -i\nmodprobe -r wl\necho \"blacklist wl\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nexit\n\nThe procedure is the same for b43.\nNext, alias the ndiswrapper driver to the USB device. Find its usb.id with:\nlsusb\n\nYou may find something like: Bus 002 Device 003: ID 13b1:003a Linksys\nWe will use the usb.id 13b1:003a to ceate an alias to the driver:\nsudo ndiswrapper -a 13B1:003A bcmwlhigh5\n\nOf course, substitute your exact details here. If unsure, post your details and we'll help.\n\nA: Type\nsudo lsmod\n\nThis is a list of active \"drivers\". If you see anything resembling your onboard card here, do\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nand add your bad driver there. Reboot.\n", "Q: Access Ubuntu SSH Server from Ubuntu Desktop Hi I have a Ubuntu Server and I have configured public and private key on that server. Previously I was using Windows 7. So I just installed Putty and was accessing my Ubuntu Server from Windows 7 successfully. \nNow I migrated from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 12.04. Now I want to access my Ubuntu Server. \nHow can I do it? Will I have to use Putty? Or something else will also work?\nI remember when I used to access Ubuntu Server from Windows 7 via Putty I had to provide a key over there as well. So How can I do this now? \nI installed putty as well. But its not working. Every time I start putty, after some seconds a message is displayed \"Server unexpectedly closed the connection\".\n\nA: ssh (package openssh-client) is a standard part of Ubuntu.\nYou may need to convert your private key from putty format for use with Linux ssh.\nSee: How do I install a ssh private key generated by puttygen?\n", "Q: Boot to external hdd from a UnetBootin usb key I have an external hdd with multiple operating systems on it (Ubuntu, Centos, etc).  On newer computers, the drive is recognized as a USB HDD and I can boot it directly just fine.  \nHowever on an older computer, the BIOS allows me to boot from a USB key, but not a USB HDD. Go figure.  The BIOS cannot be updated. Therefore I want to use the USB key like an intermediate BIOS, to redirect the boot to the USB HDD.  \nThe bootloader on the USB key is UNetBootin but I cannot find the showcustom commands to boot to the external HDD.  I don't need to install anything, I just want to find a way to boot to the Ubuntu partition (or any partition) on the external HDD.  \nAlternatively since the USB key boots into its own Ubuntu just fine, and sees all the partitions on the external HDD, can I somehow point to a partition and reload it?  \nI don't have grub\n\nA: Have a look at Plop Boot Manager. It's a very small ISO, which you can burn to CD or USB, from which you can boot it.\nBesides other things, it enables you to boot some devices which your BIOS can't. E.g. I use it to boot an Ubuntu USB on computers without the support of booting from USB devices. Before you boot Plop, make sure that USB Legacy Emulation is disabled in your BIOS setup.\n", "Q: Command line file rename with date and time I want to do a weather cam web page I have the command line to take the photo from the webcam then upload it via FTP but I want to do a backup of the photo with time and date as the file name so currently it would be 201410162011.jpg I have tried tried to google for the info but with no luck.\n\nA: If your photo is named file.jpg and you want to back it up to a file named after the date, then run:\ncp file.jpg \"$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M').jpg\"\n\nIf the back-up files go in a different directory:\ncp file.jpg \"/path/to/backups/$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M').jpg\"\n\nIf, instead of backing it up, you wanted to rename the file, then use mv in place of cp:\nmv file.jpg \"$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M').jpg\"\n\n\nA: If you need a one-liner then this should work:\ncp photo.jpg \"/path/to/backup/folder/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M).jpg\"\n\nOtherwise I'd recommend storing the date in a variable then calling the cp command.\ndate=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)\ncp \"$source\" \"/path/${date}.jpg\"\n\n", "Q: root in ubuntu14.04 LTS i use ubuntu 14.04 LTS \nmy aim is to copy file called .bully to root on ubuntu but still told me that i don't have permission to do that even my account is administrative \nso what can i do to have permession to past them \nany help would be appreciated \n\nA: Having an administrative account on a Linux machine doesn't mean that every command you execute is automatically run with full permissions. This would be unwise and may even make your system unusable.\nTo run a command with full access to the file system, you can add sudo before the command. This will run the following command as the actual root user, so it gains the needed permissions.\nExample:\nsudo cp .bully /\n\nThis would copy the file .bully to the root directory. This wouldn't work without sudo, as the root directory doesn't provide write access to anyone but the root user.\n\nTo include my comment into the answer: You should never run a program with administrative rights, if you don't know what you're actually doing. Before you start messing around, with sudo, I recommend you to at least learn the usage of the following comands by heart (including options):\nls, cd, cat, less, more, grep, rm, mv\n\nIf you can use these commands properly, you can accomplish many tasks from the termina. Only if you feel sure in using them, you should start doing administrative tasks with sudo.

When I start my terminal in ubuntu (14.04) I get the message\nsdfsdfsdi: command not found\n\nAs you can see it just looks like someone (maybe myself) was banging the keyboard in frustration and then accidentally wrote to some script that bash reads on initialization.

connected? I have the M5A97 motherboard, with the audio ports displayed on this picture:\n\nAs you can see on the part labelled \"Audio\", there are 6 jacks.\nBy default, the pink one is configured to be the microphone input, and the green one to be the speakers output. (I think some others are also outputs but I think that's irrelevant.)\nI'd like to permanently plug in my headset and my speakers, and then alternate the output between each of them in software (preferably some easily accessible sound options).\nNote that I said alternate - meaning only a single output is active at the time. I don't want my speakers blasting when I select the headset as the output, vice-versa.\nThe microphone is on the headset, and will also be plugged in at all times, but of course should as well be toggled in software.\nHow can this be done?\n\nA: You can try Sound Switcher Indicator or Pulse Audio Volume Control....\nSound Switcher Indicator\n\"Sound input/output selector indicator for Ubuntu/Unity\" -- github.com/yktoo/indicator-sound-switcher\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:yktooo/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-sound-switcher\n\nPulse Audio Volume Control\n\"PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) is a simple GTK based volume control tool (\"mixer\") for the PulseAudio sound server.

I haven been trying to use the \"d\" delete command to do so, but can't seem to figure it out\n\nA: What kind of \"space\"?\nTo \"delete all blank spaces\" can mean one of different things:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete all occurrences of the space character, code 0x20.\n\n*delete all horizontal space, including the horizontal tab character, \"\\t\"\n\n*delete all whitespace, including newline, \"\\n\" and others\n\n\nThe right tool for the job\nIf sed it not a requirement for some hidden reason, better use the right tool for the job.  \nThe command tr has the main use in translating (hence the name \"tr\") a list of characters to a list of other characters. As an corner case, it can translate to the empty list of characters; The option -d (--delete) will delete characters that appear in the list.\nThe list of characters can make use of character classes in the [:...:] syntax.\n\n\n*\n\n*tr -d ' ' < input.txt > no-spaces.txt\n\n*tr -d '[:blank:]' < input.txt > no-spaces.txt\n\n*tr -d '[:space:]' < input.txt > no-spaces.txt\nWhen insisting on sed\nWith sed, the [:...:] syntax for character classes needs to be combined with the syntax for character sets in regexps, [...], resulting in the somewhat confusing [[:...:]]:\n\n\n*\n\n*sed 's/ //g' input.txt > no-spaces.txt\n\n*sed 's/[[:blank:]]//g' input.txt > no-spaces.txt\n\n*sed 's/[[:space:]]//g' input.txt > no-spaces.txt\n\nA: perhaps this way too late, but sed takes regular expression as input.

Is it a bug or an intentionally missing feature? (Windows 7 finds all files whether they've been opened or not.)\n\nA: The reason search isn't working in this case is because /media is blacklisted in /etc/updatedb.conf. The solution is to mount the partition on /mnt and ran sudo /etc/cron.daily/mlocate.\nSearch uses multiple search engines. Zeitgeist indexes the recently used documents, which is why some files from the partition are showing, and some aren't. But other search engines (mlocate) and os-walk (previously 'find') are problematic.\nIf your drives are NTFS, they aren't blacklisted, but are probably mounted in /media, which is why they aren't being indexed.\n\nA: As dez93_2000 mentioned, /media path is blacklisted, but you can remove it from /etc/updatedb.conf and set PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS to \"no\". If you run updatedb after that you should notice some time will be spent on processing newly found media devices.\n", "Q: Difference between echo -e \"\" and echo $\"\" What is the defference between using\necho -e \"Hello\\nWorld\" \n\nand \necho $\"Hello\\nWorld\" \n\ndon't they both output:\nHello\nWorld\n\n\nA: echo -e and echo $'...' are both similar in that they support the following escape sequences:\n  \\a     alert (bell)\n  \\b     backspace\n  \\e\n  \\E     an escape character\n  \\f     form feed\n  \\n     new line\n  \\r     carriage return\n  \\t     horizontal tab\n  \\v     vertical tab\n  \\\\     backslash\n  \\0nnn  the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (zero to three octal digits)\n  \\xHH   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits)\n  \\uHHHH the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits)\n  \\UHHHHHHHH\n         the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits)\n\nThey do have differences.  In addition to the above, echo -e supports:\n  \\c     suppress further output\n  \\0nnn  the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (zero to three octal digits)\n\nBy contrast, $'....' supports:\n\n \\'     single quote\n \\\"     double quote\n \\nnn   the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (one to three digits)\n \\cx    a control-x character\n\n\nObserve that, between the two, the \\c extensions are incompatible:\n$ echo -e  'start\\n\\cIstop'\nstart\n$ echo  $'start\\n\\cIstop'\nstart\n        stop\n\nFor echo -e above, \\c suppresses further output, thereby ignoring the Istop.  By contrast, for $'...', the \\cI is interpreted as a tab.\nThe visually-similar form: $\"...\"\nBy contrast with $'...', the function of $\"...\" is quite different.  It will cause the string it contains to be translated according to the current locale.\nThe echo -e controversy\necho -e is not universally supported by shells and many regard the -e option as a design mistake.  Observe:\n$ ls\n-e  -n\n$ echo *\n$ printf \"%s\\n\" *\n-e\n-n\n\nAs you can see, if what you are printing with echo starts with a dash, the results can be unexpected.  Unless you are sure that the first string that you will print with echo does not start with a dash, you are likely better off using printf.\nFor these reasons, the POSIX standard concludes:\n\nNew applications are encouraged to use printf instead of echo.\n\nChet Ramey, who has maintained bash for the last 22 years, agrees:\n\n[N]ew code should use printf.\n\n", "Q: How can I safely upgrade from Gnome 3.10 to 3.12 WITHOUT getting 3.14?

(But I can use windows for those movies/streams if that is an better platform)\nAnd which parts of the 8.04 guide is still usable and what part needs to change?\n\nA: The main differences between the different *buntu systems is the Desktop Environment (DE) that they use. A lot of the choices boil down to personal preference as there are no major structural differences beneath the hood. They will all run the same software. Ubuntu running Unity is the heaviest on system resources, but it is probably the most polished GUI, Xubuntu runs XFCE and is very fast and quite customizable. Lubuntu is the lightest and fastest of all of the *buntus. It isn't as easy to customize but works very well on older machines and netbooks. I personally use Lubuntu on my i3 based laptop because I love how fast and lightweight it is. Another bonus to a lightweight system is increased battery life.\nI would recommend getting a liveCD of each of them and just try them out. This will give you a good idea if drivers are working. In a live session you can't do much harm (just don't go messing with Gparted). When you are downloading make sure you select the right iso for your architecture.\n", "Q: How does one 'vote' for a release codename?

Mark Shuttleworth actually picks the code name himself, based on which attributes he thinks the release should embody.  Although he may consider input, there is actually no \"voting\" for the release name.\n\nA: You can add your suggestion by editing this Ubuntu wiki page: Development Code Names. I don't think you can vote on them though.\n", "Q: juju bootstrap fails with connection timed out errors This is a follow up question to my earlier question.

I want to have the 0 key pull up Clementine and bring it to the foreground. Right now I have it set to launch Clementine, but it just dances in the launcher and doesn't come to the foreground. So, I have Clementine pinned to the second slot on the launcher, and I want to set up a custom key shortcut via the Keyboard Settings.

Without a dedicated shortcut you would have to program an xdotool macro to access the menu and launch the equalizer, but I am not quite sure if that would work, either.\n\nIn any case, as you can see most of these customizations can be performed using virtual xdotool key presses. \nIf you are wondering how to assign these commands to hotkeys of your choice make sure to check out this Q&A:\nHow can I change what keys on my keyboard do? (How can I create custom keyboard commands/shortcuts?)\n\nA: Another (I think easier) approach would be to use AutoKey.\nOnce the keys are set as hotkeys, you can use custom defined phrases to have them emit almost anything you want.\n\nAutoKey also supports scriptis written in Python that can do almost anything when they are activated by a trigger phrase or hotkey. You can even tell a script to only work in certain windows so the hotkeys/trigger phrases behave as normal keys elsewhere.\n\nA: Probably you can grab the scancodes of the keys and assign the shortcuts manually.

I would like to use the 1 TB HDD in my old PC (had Windows XP) to dual boot Ubuntu.\nI'm looking for infos. I seem to see alot of tutorials with people having issues, which make me a little nervous.

It should just show up normally under your drives.\n\n*Restart your computer and enter the bios. Disable fastboot and secure boot in the bios.\n\n*Boot into ubuntu from a usb or disc.\n\n*Install ubuntu under \"something else\" using this guide. And make sure to install the bootloader to your primary harddrive (the one with windows on it).\n\n*Boot from the primary harddrive and it should open GRUB and from there you should be able to choose between your different drives.\n\n\nHope this helps!\nSide note: I would personally stick with xp or maybe try to get your hands on 7 because 8 is terrible and locks up your computer to make it difficult to install other operating systems.\n\nA: I read a lot, watched some videos and was ready to give it a go. I put in a disk with Ubuntu 14.04, chose \"Something else\" to install and noticed the second choice of Replace existing OS was my second drive with Windows XP. Thinking well, Ubuntu software is probably better then me at installing and it's reading my second hard drive. What is the chance that it would have any effect on a completely separate OS/hard drive? Well, after overwriting Windows 8.1 to which I had just moved all my pictures and videos (omg) and recovering them (thank God), I finally have Ubuntu on my second drive. Now I just have to get Dell to send me Windows 8.1 again for the other drive, lol. Then I can figure out how to dual boot in the other direction, or I'll probably have to reinstall Ubuntu.

When typing, make CUSTOMCOMMAND what you want the command to be when you type it in the terminal.sudo su, cd /usr/bin, nano CUSTOMCOMMAND. Then, write #!/bin/bash and make a little script of what yo want to happen when you run your command. Then press Ctrl+X when done, answer y, press Enter, and chmod +x CUSTOMCOMMAND. That command should now work, no reboot should be needed. The command might only work for root.

To get rid of that, I had to do the following in an advanced command prompt: \nDiskpart\nList disk            (Note which disk is your System drive number. Mine was 2)\nSel disk 2\nList vol               (Note which volume is the EFI partition mine is 4)\nSel vol 4\nassign letter=V:       (or any other unassigned letter)\nExit\n\nThen navigate into that directory: \nV:\ncd EFI\ndir               (to see what is in there. I had neon and ubuntu in the list) \nrmdir /S ubuntu\nrmdir /S neon \n\nAnd restart! Make note of whatever other directory in there that might be linux related and delete them. I initially didn't know neon was a Linux Flavour (I received my husband's old laptop, I didn't install these) and that caused further headaches as my computer kept restart in the grub terminal. \n", "Q: How to find RBG or HEX code of a picture area?

What is the difference between primary group and secondary group in Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you are talking about file system groups, they are pretty well explained here cyberciti article. The primary group is used by default when creating a new file. You can test this \ntouch foo\nls -la foo\n\nThe file will be owned by you and be in your primary group. Users who are also in your primary group will have group level permissions on those files.\nYou can check your secondary groups with\ngroups $(whoami)\n\nIt also possible to share files with people who are not in your primary group by setting Set Group ID on a directory. This is explained here: shared folder with SetGID.\n\nA: The primary group is the group applied to you when you log in using the usual methods (TTYs, GUI, SSH, etc.). \nSince processes usually inherit the group of the parent, and your initial process or shell would have your primary group as the group, anything you do usually has the effect of the primary group on it (creating files, for example).\nThe secondary groups are the groups you can start processes as without using a group password, either via sg or to log in to via the newgrp command.\nSo if you have a primary group x and a secondary group y,\ntouch foo\n\nwill usually create a file with x as the group owner (unless the parent directory is SETGID to another group). However, you can do:\nsg y 'touch bar'\n# or\nnewgrp y\ntouch baz\n\nThen bar and baz will be created with y as the group.\nHowever, if you don't have a group in your secondary groups (say z), the sg and newgroup commands will ask for the group password if you use them with z.\n", "Q: Is it compulsory to add \"Cleaning section\" while bulding local ubuntu respository I am using Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal) version and it is at EOL.\nThe repositories for older releases that are not supported get moved to an archive server.

Yes - this concerns the question which commands in terminal are possible, for to find out which programs are initialized (visible and non-visible) - by program1.

I dont mean this here:\nStep 1:\ntop\n\nAnd then step 2:\nsudo kill -9 PID 'number-of-process'\n\nI mean for to list all programs, which are running by program1 (even hidden processes ... ).

To my knowledge these are:\n\n\n*\n\n*top. Launch top and then press V. From man top:\n ´V' :Forest-View-Mode toggle\n      In  this  mode,  processes are reordered according to their\n      parents and the layout of the COMMAND column resembles that\n      of  a  tree.   In  forest view mode it is still possible to\n      toggle between program name and commamd line (see  the  'c'\n      interactive  command) or between processes and threads (see\n      the 'H' interactive command).\n\n\n*htop. This is usually not installed by default, so install using sudo apt-get install htop. Then, press F5 or t. From man htop:\nF5, t\n    Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the  rela‐\n    tions between them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch between\n    tree and your previously selected sort view. Selecting a sort view\n    will exit tree view.\n\n\n*pstree. This simple command is designed for exactly that, it shows running processes as a tree. \n\n*ps itself can also do this. For example:\n$ ps -ejH\n$ ps axjf\n\nThe important options here are -H for tree format and/or -f for full format. \n\n*You can also get all of this from the /proc filesystem if you feel like it. The children of PIDX are listed in /proc/PIDX/task/PIDX/children. So, you could show a tree of all running processes using\nps ax | awk '{print $1}' | while read pid; do \n    printf \"%s\\n\" $pid; \n    grep -o \"[0-9]*\" \"/proc/$pid/task/$pid/children\" 2>/dev/null | \n        while read cpid; do \n            printf \"  |--%s\\n\" $cpid; \n        done\ndone\n\nThis is quite silly though since it is reinventing the wheel.

I can pause Spotify by pausing all system programs playing (well, toggling). How can I do something like that to pause/play YouTube videos in Google Chrome?\n\nA: Chromium now uses D-Bus to implement MPRIS for media content currently active in the browser, and browsers built on top of Chromium such as Google Chrome and Brave inherit this feature. That means media content currently active in such browsers can be controlled using a utility such as playerctl which can send and receive MPRIS commands.\nYou can download and install playerctl from their releases section on GitHub and then run this command to pause currently running media in Chrome:\n$ playerctl pause\n\nOr you can control a specific instance of Chrome:\n$ playerctl --list-all\nchrome.instance24818\n\n$ playerctl --player=chrome.instance24818 pause\n\n\nA: Well, I guess you could always use a tool like xdotool to send a k key-press to your YouTube window. The downside to this method is that you have to activate the window before sending the key-press (Chrome ignores keyboard input when it isn't focused). \nThe following script might work for you\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Dependencies: xdotool (sudo apt-get install xdotool)\n\n# Functions\n\nsave_active () {\n    # get current workspace\n    ActiveDesktop=\"$(xdotool get_desktop)\"\n    # get current active window ID\n    ActiveWindowID=\"$(xdotool getactivewindow)\"\n    # get current active window name\n    ActiveWindowName=\"$(xdotool getwindowname \"$ActiveWindowID\")\"\n}\n\nrestore_active(){\n    xdotool set_desktop \"$ActiveDesktop\"\n    # Activating the root window (Desktop) results in an error message, so we\n    # try to avoid it\n    [[ \"$ActiveWindowName\" != \"Desktop\" ]] && xdotool windowactivate \"$ActiveWindowID\"\n}\n\nyoutube_playpause(){\n  xdotool search --name YouTube windowactivate\n  sleep 0.1\n  xdotool key --clearmodifiers k\n}\n\n# Main\n\n## save active window and desktop\nsave_active\n## activate Chrome YouTube window and send keyboard event\nyoutube_playpause\n## restore previously active window/desktop\nrestore_active\n\n\nIf controlling YouTube with your media keys is what you're after, there seem to be some extensions out there that claim to add this functionality to Chrome:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/key-socket-media-keys/fphfgdknbpakeedbaenojjdcdoajihik/reviews\n\n*https://github.com/VivekPanyam/YoutubeMediaKeysChrome\nI haven't given them a try myself, yet.\n\nA: You could start the Chrome session (with your Youtube playlist) using the Chrome WebDriver:\n\nWebDriver is an open source tool for automated testing of webapps\n  across many browsers. It provides capabilities for navigating to web\n  pages, user input, JavaScript execution, and more.  ChromeDriver is a\n  standalone server which implements WebDriver's wire protocol for\n  Chromium. ChromeDriver is available for Chrome on Android and Chrome\n  on Desktop (Mac, Linux, Windows and ChromeOS).\n\nInstall the following dependency:\nsudo apt-get install python-selenium\n\nAnd download the Chromedriver from here, select the one corresponding to your architecture e.g:\nhttp://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.14/chromedriver_linux64.zip\nor http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.14/chromedriver_linux32.zip\nExtract the chromedriver file for example in your $HOME folder.\nThen start the chromedriver from python, open a terminal and type:\n$ python\nPython 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) \n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import os\n>>> from selenium import webdriver\n>>> from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\n>>> chrome_options = Options()\n>>> chrome_options.add_argument(\"--disable-sync\")\n>>> driver = webdriver.Chrome(os.path.expanduser('~/chromedriver'), chrome_options=chrome_options)\n>>> # Open the desired youtube page:\n>>> driver.get('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxD_kWK8A5M&list=PLMquns5MbFKm_cVrB0ZjKlIlS5HCQL1dL')\n>>> # Let selenium find the player container <div>\n>>> video = driver.find_element_by_id(\"player-api\")\n>>> # And just click to play/pause your video:\n>>> video.click()\n>>> \n\nNote: You can still use the Chrome instance started by the Chrome WebDriver for browsing in other tabs. even if the Youtube tab is not the active one (no focus). The video.click() events will continue to work.\n\n\nA: Easy: run the spotify/youtube in one session of chrome and all your other stuff in another chrome session.  Then just \nkill -SIGSTOP [pid]\n\nto pause, and:\nkill -SIGCONT [pid]\n\nto resume.\nIf you make a little script to open two sessions of chrome, by:\ngoogle-chrome http://spotify.com/myplaylist http://youtube.com/myplaylist &\npgrep google-chrome > /tmp/TimChromepid.RUN\ngoogle-chrome &\n\nand have the pid ready for your toggle script:\nif [ -f /tmp/TimChromepid.RUN ]; then\n  mv /tmp/TimChromepid.RUN /tmp/TimChromepid.PSD\n  kill -SIGSTOP < /tmp/TimChromepid.PSD\nelse\n  mv /tmp/TimChromepid.PSD /tmp/TimChromepid.RUN\n  kill -SIGCONT < /tmp/TimChromepid.RUN\nfi\n\nIt would pause spotify and Youtube and whatever you put in the first Chrome session.\n", "Q: How to find Ubuntu which is already installed? How to find Ubuntu which is already installed, I have dual operating system in my COMPUTER as per windows XP and Ubuntu, a few day ago I have formatted my computer & install win 7 operating system, but I have formatted C: drive only (win xp on c: drive) but not uninstall Ubuntu, now I start computer but I can not find Ubuntu which is already installed!! I have not more idea for Ubuntu, please anyone tell me how I can find Ubuntu in my computer, My computer only show windows 7 operating system.\n\nA: How was your setup originally configured? Was XP and Ubuntu both on separate partitions on the same Drive?\nI ask because if they were on the same drive and you formatted that drive then your ubuntu install would be wiped along with xp. When you format a drive you are not just wiping one partition (ie the one xp was on), but the whole thing. I think the only thing you can do if this is the case is to reinstall ubuntu. If there were valuable files on the ubuntu partition you could MAYBE get them back by following the steps here.But you would have to attempt this BEFORE installing a fresh ubuntu os.\nYou may also be able to repair your bootloader depending on your situation, but we will need more info to clarify\nNB - Please answer the questions and clarify your OP before attempting any recovery so we have a better idea of your situation.\n", "Q: How to Install Oracel RDBMS 11G?

How to check the opened/closed ports on my computer?\nI used netstat -a on command line.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the port status \"LISTENING\" indicate that the port is open?\n\n*Is any port, that is not shown in the output, closed?\n\n\nA: You can use this command:     \nnetstat -tulnp | grep <port no>\n\nIf it shows some process its used. Its closed(not used) if there is no output.\n\nA: Or this might help by using watch, then play around with what you want to see.\nsudo watch -d -n0 \"netstat -atnp | grep ESTA\"\n\nsudo watch -d -n0 \"netstat -tulnp | grep ESTA\"\n\n\nA: Actually there is a better way to see what ports you have open. The issue with netstat or lsof is that they query network stack and actually do not connect to the machine but instead trying to see what is running on the system. The better approach is to use nmap like so:\nnmap -sT -O localhost\n\nTo see open ports.\n\nA: Another alternative command line easy to use to find out which process is using a port:\nlsof -n -i4TCP:$PORT | grep LISTEN\n\nI added the next function in my .bash_profile,\nfunction pslisten {\n    echo `lsof -n -i4TCP:$1 | grep LISTEN`\n}\n\nand now run \"pslisten 5060\" to see who is grabing my SIP port.\nIt's work with Apple Mac OS X too.\n\nA: There's a few parameters to netstat that are useful for this :\n\n\n*\n\n*-l or --listening shows only the sockets currently listening for incoming connection.\n\n*-a or --all shows all sockets currently in use.\n\n*-t or --tcp shows the tcp sockets.\n\n*-u or --udp shows the udp sockets.\n\n*-n or --numeric shows the hosts and ports as numbers, instead of resolving in dns and looking in /etc/services.\n\n\nYou use a mix of these to get what you want. To know which port numbers are currently in use, use one of these:\nnetstat -atn           # For tcp\nnetstat -aun           # For udp\nnetstat -atun          # For both\n\nIn the output all port mentioned are in use either listening for incoming connection or connected to a peer** all others are closed. TCP and UDP ports are 16 bits wide (they go from 1-65535)\n** They can also be connecting/disconnecting from the peer.\n\nA: \nIs the port status \"LISTENING\" indicated that the port is opened?\n\nYes. It means that some service is listening to that port on your computer for incoming connection i.e. this port is open for establishing new connections.\n\nAny port that are not shown in the output indicated that it's closed?\n\nYes. Remember netstat -a will show all active (listening) and passive (non-listening) connections i.e. the ports that are acting as both server (some services are listening to these ports for connections from a different machine/process) and established (connections are established on these ports regardless of the fact the host/a service can be a server or client)\nAll TCP and UDP ports belong to a category called sockets and there are a whole lot of those. To view socket info you can check man ss.\n\nA: Another option is ss. It's much easier to use....\nThe below command will only output a list of current listening sockets.\nroot@server:~# ss -l\n\n    Netid  State      Recv-Q Send-Q

I have XUbuntu 14.04 and I suspect PulseAudio but I can't figure out how to disable it.\n\nA: Stream output volume is a feature which allows individual stream properties based on applications. \nFor streams it is controlled by the pulseaudio module module-stream-restore, for audio devices it is controlled by module-device-restore, and for sound cards (if multiple) it is module-card-restore.\nTo test whether our issue is resolved we can temporarily unload any of these modules (which should be loaded from our default.pa), e.g.:\npacmd unload-module module-stream-restore\n\nThe module will be re-loaded by restarting the pulseaudio sound server with\npulseaudio -k\n\nIf after unloading the issue was resolved we can prevent loading this module by commenting out the line in our default.pa (located in /etc/pulse/, ~/.pulse/, or ~/.config/pulse/ like this:\n#load-module module-stream-restore\n\n", "Q: I am trying to run the MaxView document management program I have downloaded MaxView 0.7 from    http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxview/ \nWhen I try to open the file the message is: \n'Dependency is not satisfiable:libpoppler-qt 4-3(>=0.10) Error'\nMy goal is to get a Brother-MFC-9420-CN printer/scanner/fax online.

In order to do that I removed the 2 hard drives inside (2 TB each) and connected them to a PC running Ubuntu system, the problem is that I know very little about RAID1 systems and have no experience doing administrator work with such partitions / arrays.

How could I fix this?\n\nA: You'll need to setup a script to automatically run on shutdown.\nSee https://askubuntu.com/a/564674\nCreate /etc/init.d/vagrant with this content:\n#!/bin/bash\nvagrant global-status | awk '/running/{print $1}' | xargs -r -d '\\n' -n 1 -- vagrant suspend\n\nMake it executable and link it into the shutdown run modes:\nchmod +x /etc/init.d/vagrant\nln -s /etc/init.d/vagrant /etc/rc0.d/K10vagrant\nln -s /etc/init.d/vagrant /etc/rc6.d/K10vagrant\n\nYou can test it by starting some vagrant VM's and then running the script as root:\nsudo /etc/init.d/vagrant\n\n\nA: Nick Breen's solution no longer works (as of October 2015, vagrant 1.4.3), as there is no longer a subcommand vagrant-status.\nI used Darren Beale's one-liner in the /etc/init.d/vagrant file, and it works great:\nfor VM in `VBoxManage list runningvms | awk '{ print $2; }'`; do VBoxManage controlvm $VM poweroff; done\n\n", "Q: error running virtualbox 4.1 in ubuntu 14.04 i've installed ubuntu 14.04 today.\ni had virtualbox 4.1 running perfectly on ubuntu 12.04.\nNow, when i try starting Virtualbox 4.1 on ubuntu 14.04, i see this error: \nKernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)\n\nThe VirtualBox Linux kernel driver (vboxdrv) is either not loaded or there is a permission problem with /dev/vboxdrv.

You can install the headers and rebuild the module with:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\nThe reason it was working before the upgrade was, that you apparently had installed the headers for the old kernel at some point and built the kernel module with their help as we can see in the output of dkms status.\n", "Q: How to sync the ubuntu repository I am using Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal) version and it is at EOL.\nThe repositories for older releases that are not supported get moved to an archive server.

Keyboard Input Methods is a program used to adjust methods for keyboard input. IBus normally automatically starts up at login. To use IBus open any GUI application e.g. gedit, LibreOffice Writer, etc. and start typing in the text input area.\nOtherwise ibus can be accessed either from Systems Settings -> Language Support -> Language tab -> dropdown menu to the right of where it says Keyboard input method system: or from the terminal by typing ibus.\nIf this information isn't sufficient for your purposes, then please provide additional information about what you are trying to use Keyboard Input Methods to do. For example, changing the keyboard input language, if you are using more than one text entry language, can be done quickly using the keyboard combination Super+Space. The Super key has a Microsoft Windows logo on it in many keyboards.\nTo add the Hindi language go to Systems Settings -> Text Entry -> under Input sources to use: click Hindi. Then click the little keyboard icon to open the Hindi window and display the Hindi keyboard layout. Is the Hindi keyboard layout displayed in the Hindi window? If the Hindi keyboard layout isn't displayed in the Hindi window, you can add it by clicking on the plus button (+) to open the Choose an input source window, selecting the Hindi language from the list of keyboard input languages, and then clicking the Add button to add the Hindi language to the language selection menu that is in the notification area of the desktop panel next to the volume icon and the clock icon.\n\nMake sure that \"Show current input source in the menu bar\" is marked by a check mark.\n\nAdd Hindi keyboard layout\n\nEnglish translation of Monika von Birkenstein's output from running the command ibus from the terminal.

And it doens't start automatically at login. And if I go to Systems Settings -> Language Support -> Language tab, there is a sign that says I am using Ibus, but I'm not. If I typ ibus in the terminal, then there is this (I'm using ubuntu in Dutch):\nGebruik: ibus OPDRACHT [OPTIE...]\n\nOpdrachten:\n  engine         Stel programmamotor in of haal deze op\n  exit           Verlaat ibus-achtergronddienst\n  list-engine    Toon beschikbare programmamotoren\n  watch          (Niet geïmplementeerd)\n  restart        Start ibus-achtergronddienst opnieuw op\n  version        Toon versie\n  read-cache     Toon de inhoud van tijdelijke opslag van register\n  write-cache    Maak tijdelijke opslag van register aan\n  address        Druk het D-Bus-adres af van ibus-achtergronddienst\n  help           Toon deze informatie\n\nI really can't find or start or use Ibus anywhere on my computer.

In a previous question, I found out how to shut down all instances of running VMs started through vagrant. I'd like to call that script when logging out of my Desktop Manager which is currently Cinnamon. \nSome have pointed to another similar similar, but I did not understand the selected answer(s) enough to be able to solve my issue and put anything into action. The comments below point to start on stopping lightdm. This sounds like what I'm looking for. That is how can I run a script to stop all VMs (called: stop-vagrant.sh) when my log out of my desktop manager (start on stopping lightdm)? \n\nA: What you need to do is create an Upstart job. Let us say your script for stopping VMs is available at /some/path/vagrant-stop.sh. \nDepending on the exact nature of your VMs (are they run only when you're logged into a GUI, or are they run when the system starts up, etc.), you could use either a System job or a Session job. For the case where the VMs are run only when you're logged into a GUI, you can use a session job, a simple example of which I'll present here:\nCreate a file in ~/.config/upstart with a .conf extension (use your favourite editor):\nvim ~/.config/upstart/stop-vms.conf\n\nThe content would be:\ndescription \"Give your task a description\"\nstart on session-end\n\ntask\n\nexec /some/path/vagrant-stop.sh\n\nRun initctl check-config to see if there are any errors.\nNow, you can stop your VMs with (pardon the phrasing):\nstart stop-vms\n\nUpstart will automatically run this when you log out.\n", "Q: some ubuntu steam games use more RAM than windows version Why some steam games (as XCOM Enemy Unknown) need more RAM memory on Linux than on Windows? Minimum requirements for Windows are: Windows Vista / 2GB RAM and for Linux are:  Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit) and 4 GB RAM.\n\nA: As a complementary answer in GameDev about porting a steam game to Linux, it could depend on many factors. Here are the comparison:\n\n\nWe can see that on Linux is double the amount of memory. Apart from reasons mentioned in the link about compilers, libraries and more, from the Steam and Game developer perspective, they want to make sure that the game runs perfect on said platform. This means that the requirements could be lower or higher when compared to Windows or Mac. In most cases, the requirements are the same (Like in Wasteland 2) or could be double like this game or even Borderlands: The Prequel. It depends at the end of several important factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the game have a native or developed engine on Linux (This has a big influence on hardware requirements)\n\n*Is the game/engine optimized for Linux (Think of it of Wasteland 2 on Linux 32-Bit versus Wasteland 2 Patch 2 on Linux 32-Bit. Basically 2x betters performance). This also includes less overhead, less memory/cpu usages, less I/O and more.\n\n*Does it use the correct libraries or library versions. This also includes video drivers, audio drivers, controllers and more.\nWith time, some games tend to have less hardware requirements after the developers have had more time to work on it. For example the Valve Engines games at the beginning had a huge memory requirement. After several months of optimization, they got to a level similar to Windows with a better overall performance.\nAlso notice that this are Minimum and Recommended hardware requirements added by Steam. I am pretty sure Windows users do not need 4 GB as a recommended amount of memory, nor do they need an Nvidia 8600 as a Minimum. Some users might have a great experience using lower requirements while others might actually need the Recommended for a \"minimum\" experience.\nAdditionally, don't be surprise if in a couple of months you see this same game with the same hardware requirements as Windows. Remember that between some Ubuntu developers helping out with Steam, the steam developers working on Linux to improve performance and the road that will lead gamers to Linux, and game development companies seeing Linux as an option, better requirements, more optimizations and more games will start to appear on this platform. \nDon't know if anybody played Gothic 3 without any updates, or far cry without any updates.

Does it actually only print a y\\n when requested by apt-get?\n\nA: N.B. this is not a complete answer, but I'm keeping it here, mainly because there are good comments below.\n\nDoes it actually only print a y\\n when requested by apt-get?\n\nYes. \nThe right-hand side of pipes work at the same time as the left-hand side is producing output. Further, the left-side won't go to \"completion\" unless required. For example, the following will create an infinite loop, writing to the terminal until killed.\nwhile true; do echo foo; done\n\nHowever, the following will print out 10 lines, then exit gracefully.\nwhile true; do echo foo; done | head\n\nOnce the head command completes, the left-hand side of the pipe doesn't need to work any more, and the \"infinite\" loop is no more.\n", "Q: Out of Box Experience Does Ubuntu have an \"Out of Box Experience\" set up similar to Windows?  I intend to sell used PCs with Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS preinstalled and I want my customers to be able to set up their own username, password, etc.\n\nA: No, however, as you are probably aware, the closest thing to an OoB experience is simply running through the install themselves.\nAssuming you're not trying to install software for the customer, you could simply mount the ubuntu ISO directly to the HDD and then update grub. \nNow, when the customer powers up the device, they can simply run through the install wizard, dictating their usernames/passwords/etc.\nAside from that, your 2 options are to either build an OoB experience for Ubuntu yourself, or educate the customer on how to use and customize the pre-installed OS.\n", "Q: Run PHP script from command line? How can I simply run a PHP script in the command line? Also is it possible to run it like it would be if the URL was typed in?\n\nA: As long as you have php installed, you run a PHP file using\n/usr/bin/php /path/to/php/file.php\n\nOr if your $PATH is set up properly to include /usr/bin, then simply\nphp /path/to/php/file.php\n\nYou can check if PHP is installed, by running\nwhich php\n\n\nA: Use the php5 command:\nphp5 /path/to/php/script\n\nIt's part of the php5-cli package.\nThe php command is part of the alternatives system, so it always points to something else. Depending on the version of PHP your script is in, it would be better to use the versioned command.\nRunning a PHP script the way it is called by a webserver is a bit complicated. The server sets up quite a few variables, which may or may not be used by the script. It would be much more simpler to run a webserver itself.\n\nA: If SSH disabled:\n<?php\n$output = shell_exec('which php');\necho \"<pre>$output</pre>\";\n?>\n\n", "Q: Make error on Nvidia drivers and kernel 3.17 I can't install nvidia-331-updates-uvm alongside with kernel 3.17 on Ubuntu 14.04.\nHere is the make.log of nvidia driver.\nHas someone solved this problem ?!\n\nA: Whit the tip of Taz D, I was able to run the kernel 3.17 alongside with the last Nvidia driver.

I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my Netbook Asus Eeepc-900 from bootable USB. When I see partitions screen I just wanna one single partition and then install Ubuntu, but has some many options that I don't know which choose.\nHere are the options:\n1 \n2 \n3 \nWell, I would leave only a partition with Ubuntu installed. \nGrateful!\n\nA: You have two hard disks (one 4GB and one 16GB), and the 16GB disk has LVM set up on it.\nSo the structure would be like this:\nNAME\nsda\n├─sda1\n├─sda5\nsdb\n├─sdb1\n└─sdb5\n  └─ubuntu--vg\n    └─ubuntu--vg-root\n    └─ubuntu--vg-swap_1\n\nThe LVM volumes (the ones starting with /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-) are actually contained in /dev/sdb5.

I want to do this without having to know the previous birth date and instead be able to search generically.  I know the person's name that the birth date is associated with, so I can use that to make the substitution\nI've tried this:\nsed \"s/^PersonsName\\/[1-12]\\/[0-31]\\/[0-99]/11\\/14\\/46/g\" txt.file\n\nBut it doesn't work and I'm not sure how to proceed\n\nThe suggested answers below haven't worked for me.  I'm going to give some example data and see if this helps to clarify.  \nPopeye Sailor:156-454-3322:945 Bluto Street, Anywhere, USA 29358:3/19/35:22350\n\nLet's pretend I'm trying to change Popeye's birth date (which is at the end), but I want to search without having to know his current one.  I know using a regular expression is key here, but so far the examples I've seen haven't worked.  Maybe providing the above example data will help\n[Expected Output]\nPopeye Sailor:156-454-3322:945 Bluto Street, Anywhere, USA 29358:11/14/46:22350\n\nAll I'm interested in changing is the birth date at the end to 11/14/46\n\nA: [1-12]\\/[0-31] and [0-99] do not mean 1 to 12, 0 to 31 and 0 to 99.\n\n\n*\n\n*[1-12] means a range of characters starting from 1 till 1, and a 2. In essence: [12]. (Compare with [0-1a].)\n\n*[0-31]  means a range of characters starting from 0 till 3, and a 1: [0123].\n\n\nSimilarly for [0-99]. Expressing a range of numbers with regular expressions isn't easy.\nIf the numbers don't use double digits (01/06/33), you'll have to do something like:\n[0-9]{1,2} for day and month, and [0-9]{2} for the year, or the regex will quickly grow unwieldy. This, of course, risks the selection of something like 99/99/99.\nFor an example:\n$ sed \"s/^\\(muru\\/\\)[0-9]\\{1,2\\}\\/[0-9]\\{1,2\\}\\/[0-9]\\{2\\}/\\111\\/14\\/46/g\" <<<'muru/1/4/85'\nmuru/11/14/46\n$ sed \"s/^\\(muru\\/\\)[0-9]\\{1,2\\}\\/[0-9]\\{1,2\\}\\/[0-9]\\{2\\}/\\111\\/14\\/46/g\" <<<'muru/10/4/85'\nmuru/11/14/46\n$ sed \"s/^\\(muru\\/\\)[0-9]\\{1,2\\}\\/[0-9]\\{1,2\\}\\/[0-9]\\{2\\}/\\111\\/14\\/46/g\" <<<'muru/10/28/85'\nmuru/11/14/46\n\nI assume you want to retain the name, so I used backreferences to refer to it in the substitution (the \\1).\n\nA: Dates are tricky, but simplifying to a similar extent to your attempt…\nsed -r 's,^PersonsName1?[0-9]/[1-3]?[0-9]/[0-9]{2},11/14/46,' txt.file\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*Use -r for extended regular expressions. This allows (for example) ?.\n\n*Generally, I prefer single quotes ' rather than double \", so there's no shell expansion.\n\n*Instead of using / as sed delimiters, you can use whatever you want. Here I've used ,, so that we don't need to escape literal /s.\n\n*1?[0-9] match an optional 1 and required 0-9, for the month.\n\n*[1-3]?[0-9] match and optional 1-3, and a required 0-9 for the day.\n\n*[0-9]{2} match two digits for the year.\n\n*N.B. that this will potentially have some false matches. e.g. 0/0/00 and 19/39/99 will match, but you can tweak the regex more if you like. See the link above for more information.\n\n\nMore comments\nNote that this matches something like PersonsName11/11/11, and replaces the whole thing, similar to what your attempt tried to do. If you want to only replace the date, you can use the following instead.\nsed -r 's,^(PersonsName)1?[0-9]/[1-3]?[0-9]/[0-9]{2},\\111/14/46,' txt.file\n\nHere, we capture PersonsName, using parens. Then we can refer to it again in the replace section with \\1.\n\nA: You could use the below sed command,\n$ sed '/^Popeye Sailor:/s/:[^:]*\\(:[^:\\/]*\\)$/:11\\/14\\/46\\1/' file\nPopeye Sailor:156-454-3322:945 Bluto Street, Anywhere, USA 29358:11/14/46:22350\n\nIt changes the date only on the lines which starts with Popeye Sailor:\n", "Q: How to install latest calibre (any package) on Ubuntu? If I am installing calibre with apt-get, it installs version 1.25\n# sudo apt-show-versions calibre\ncalibre:all/trusty 1.25.0+dfsg-1build1 uptodate\n\nwhile it's current version is 2.6.\nIs it possible to install newer calibre, staying with apt-get?\n\nA: Calibre's website advises against uses the distribution's package for this reason (It's typically outdated/buggy). And I didn't see any repositories with updated calibre, so apt-get wasn't looking like the best option. \nYou can use wget, though, to download & install the binaries right from Calibre. Calibre's site instructs you to paste the following command into the terminal to install or update:\nsudo -v && \n  wget -nv -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/master/setup/linux-installer.py | \n  sudo python -c \"import sys; main=lambda:sys.stderr.write('Download failed\\n'); exec(sys.stdin.read()); main()\"\n\nSource: http://calibre-ebook.com/download_linux\nI just did it, and it worked perfectly. And when Calibre tells you there's a new version, you should be able to paste that same thing into the terminal to update. Or you can write a script to do it automatically. \nIs there a reason you wanted to stick with apt-get, other than being familiar with it?\n\nA: This means that the version mentioned by apt-get is the latest version in the repositories that are known to it. If you are able to find a newer repo for Calibre, you could add it so apt-get can look for the packages and install it. But please make sure it's a secure/trusted repository!\nEdit: Here is a list on Launchpad with some repositories, but since the official site doesn't mention one itself (at least, I couldn't find it) they're not offical.\n", "Q: How to set XDG_RUNTIME_DIR $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not well set on my computer and this causes upstart to write PID files to my home folder.

I can't find one, and no search is helping, pleeease help me, I'm not amazing with computers.  \nEDIT: I have the Asus X200CA, if it helps.\n\nA: The motherboard itself loads up the BIOS.

I recently transitioned to Ubuntu and I'm using Terminator as my terminal emulator. \nIs there a way I can add this functionality to Terminator or if this already exists somewhere?\n\nA: Ubuntu (and many Linux systems) have a secondary clipboard - the X selection buffer. When you select something, it is automatically added to this buffer. Then you can middle-click where you want to paste it.\n\nA: Other than the middle click, you may find these helpful:\nShift+Ctrl+C => copy\nShift+Ctrl+V => paste\n\nA: This feature exists in terminator.\nGo to preferences.

But the two are the same for the other two partitions? \nIn particular, my / and /home partitions are running low, and I wonder why I can't use all the free space.\nThanks.\n\n\nA: After some googling I found this post on Launchpad stating the following (first comment):\n\nThe ext3 filesystem reserves an amount of the total space for root. If\n  some user (or daemon) fills the disk then a login couldn't be possible\n  anymore. So even root couldn't login anymore to fix it. Therefore ext3\n  reserves an amount of 5% (default) of the filesystem for the root user\n  to prevent it (it doesn't work if root fills the disk).\nAvailable space is now the total free space including the reserved\n  space for root. Free space is the free space that you as a user can\n  fill :)\nIt is possible to change this with tune2fs (PLEASE consult the manpage\n  before using this tool).\n\n\nA: According to this page, the system reserves 5% for root.

I use netstat to check my port status.\nI was wondering what's the difference between port status LISTENING, TIME_WAIT, CLOSE_WAIT, FIN_WAIT1 and ESTABLISHED?\n\nA: The manpage of netstat has a brief description of each state:\n   ESTABLISHED\n          The socket has an established connection.\n   SYN_SENT\n          The socket is actively attempting to establish a connection.\n   SYN_RECV\n          A connection request has been received from the network.\n   FIN_WAIT1\n          The socket is closed, and the connection is shutting down.\n   FIN_WAIT2\n          Connection is closed, and the socket is waiting for  a  shutdown\n          from the remote end.\n   TIME_WAIT\n          The socket is waiting after close to handle packets still in the\n          network.\n   CLOSE  The socket is not being used.\n   CLOSE_WAIT\n          The remote end has shut down, waiting for the socket to close.\n   LAST_ACK\n          The remote end has shut down, and the socket is closed.  Waiting\n          for acknowledgement.\n   LISTEN The  socket is listening for incoming connections.  Such sockets\n          are  not  included  in  the  output  unless  you   specify   the\n          --listening (-l) or --all (-a) option.\n   CLOSING\n          Both  sockets are shut down but we still don't have all our data\n          sent.\n   UNKNOWN\n          The state of the socket is unknown.\n\nYou can use the state transition diagrams (examples here, here and here) to make better sense of the states.\n\nConsider two programs attempting a socket connection (call them a and b). Both set up sockets and transition to the LISTEN state. Then one program (say a) tries to connect to the other (b). a sends a request and enters the SYN_SENT state, and b receives the request and enters the SYN_RECV state. When b acknowledges the request, they enter the ESTABLISHED state, and do their business. Now a couple of things can happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a wishes to close the connection, and enters FIN_WAIT1. b receives the FIN request, sends an ACK (then a enters FIN_WAIT2), enters CLOSE_WAIT, tells a it is closing down and the enters LAST_ACK. Once a acknowledges this (and enters TIME_WAIT), b enters CLOSE. a waits a bit to see if anythings is left, then enters CLOSE.\n\n*a and b have finished their business and decide to close the connection (simultaneous closing). When a is in FIN_WAIT, and instead of receiving an ACK from b, it receives a FIN (as b wishes to close it as well), a enters CLOSING. But there are still some messages to send (the ACK that a is supposed to get for its original FIN), and once this ACK arrives, a enters TIME_WAIT as usual.\n\n\nA: Listen: Service call os using listen() system call \"waiting\" for a TCP connection. but this system call does not block the server, the service will continue to call accept(), which will block the server when reading an empty queue. after the server calls the listen(), the os will go through the TCP three-way handshake protocol and put an estimated connection into the queue. at this time, the server will wake up from accept() and get a new socket file descriptor for the connection. you can use the new socket fd to read from os queue.\nat this time your netstate get into \"ESTABLISHED\"\n", "Q: why do all bad hostnames resolve to 198.105.254.23?

Building and installation instructions are available there.\nYou will need to obtain the appropriate headers for your kernel with the command sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\nThen, after downloading the source code package from the DIGImend project, you can build and install it with\nmake && sudo make install\nPlease refer directly to DIGImend documentation in case they ever change.\n", "Q: hibernate-disk command is failing to hibernate without producing any errors or helpful debug output The behaviour I see after running sudo hibernate-disk -v4 is a bunch of output, followed by a switch to console, which prints a few lines, ending with \"Preallocating image memory...\" and then a switch back to the X11 VT, and the computer resumes running normally.\nHere is stdout:\nhibernate-disk: Using implicit configuration file /etc/hibernate/disk.conf\nhibernate-disk:Warning: Tuxonice binary signature file not found.\nhibernate-disk: Trying method in ususpend-disk.conf...\nhibernate-disk: Including configuration from common.conf\nhibernate-disk: [01] Executing CheckLastResume ...\nhibernate-disk: [01] Executing CheckRunlevel ...\nhibernate-disk: [01] Executing LockFileGet ...\nhibernate-disk: [01] Executing NewKernelFileCheck ...\nhibernate-disk: [10] Executing EnsureUSuspendCapable ...\nhibernate-disk: [11] Executing XHacksSuspendHook1 ...\nhibernate-disk: [59] Executing RemountXFSBootRO ...\nhibernate-disk: [89] Executing SaveKernelModprobe ...\nSaved /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe is /sbin/modprobe\nhibernate-disk: [91] Executing ModulesUnloadBlacklist ...\nUnloading blacklisted modules listed /etc/hibernate/blacklisted-modules\nModule version for ipw2100 is 2\nModule version for ipw2200 is 2\nModule version for snd_bt_sco is\nModule version for ndiswrapper is\nUnloading blacklisted module mac80211 (and dependencies)\nUnloading rtl8723ae ...\nRemoving modules with rmmod.\nUnloading rtl_pci ...\nUnloading rtlwifi ...\nUnloading mac80211 ...\nhibernate-disk: [95] Executing XHacksSuspendHook2 ...\nxhacks: changing console from 7 to 15\nhibernate-disk: [98] Executing CheckRunlevel ...\nhibernate-disk: [99] Executing DoUSuspend ...\nhibernate-disk: Running /usr/sbin/s2disk ...\nhibernate-disk: [90] Executing ModulesLoad ...\nLoading module rtl8723ae (from auto)...\nLoading module rtl_pci (from auto)...\nLoading module rtlwifi (from auto)...\nLoading module mac80211 (from auto)...\nhibernate-disk: [89] Executing RestoreKernelModprobe ...\nhibernate-disk: [85] Executing XHacksResumeHook2 ...\nxhacks: changing console back to 7\nhibernate-disk: [70] Executing ClockRestore ...\nhibernate-disk: [59] Executing RemountXFSBootRW ...\nhibernate-disk: [11] Executing XHacksResumeHook1 ...\nhibernate-disk: [01] Executing NoteLastResume ...\nhibernate-disk: [01] Executing LockFilePut ...\n\nHere is stdout and stderr together (big): http://pastebin.com/AWDt5xZn\nAnd here is dmesg output during the hibernation:\n[196345.773202] wlan1: deauthenticating from c8:d7:19:8c:78:9f by local choice (reason=3)\n[196345.839413] cfg80211: Calling CRDA to update world regulatory domain\n[196345.845045] cfg80211: World regulatory domain updated:\n[196345.845053] cfg80211:   (start_freq - end_freq @ bandwidth), (max_antenna_gain, max_eirp)\n[196345.845057] cfg80211:   (2402000 KHz - 2472000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\n[196345.845088] cfg80211:   (2457000 KHz - 2482000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\n[196345.845092] cfg80211:   (2474000 KHz - 2494000 KHz @ 20000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\n[196345.845095] cfg80211:   (5170000 KHz - 5250000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\n[196345.845099] cfg80211:   (5735000 KHz - 5835000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\n[196346.158150] Syncing filesystems ... done.\n[196346.165319] Freezing user space processes ...

Not sure where to go from here.\n\nA: I've seen messages here and there about hibernation on Ubuntu/Linux in general not being well supported, and being a low priority for the Ubuntu kernel team.  \nI recommend trying out alternatives, like the tuxonice patches.  There is a ppa for tuxonice here: https://launchpad.net/~tuxonice/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nTuxonice is a set of kernel patches which provides an alternative method of hibernation than what comes with the stock kernel.  I had a success in the past with tuxonice, so it's worth a shot.  Good luck!\n\nA: The Linux kernel documentation has a debug procedure for suspend/hibernation issues.\nYou should read the full document, but the gist of it is... You should iteratively try the test modes of hiberation—freezer, devices, platform, processors and core— starting with the least invasive (freezer) and going up to the most invasive (core).\n# echo <test mode> > /sys/power/pm_test\n# echo platform > /sys/power/disk\n# echo disk > /sys/power/state\n\nI suspect from your logs that the problem might be related to ACPI—it seems that everything works up to the moment that the CPU must be suspended—and, if so, it probably can be solved adding some kernel command line options.\n\nA: I don't have hibernate-disk installed, but you could try to hibernate system like this:\necho disk > /sys/power/state \n\nor you could suspend to low power mode (S3), sleep on windows with this:\necho mem > /sys/power/state \n\nmaybe you have to be sudo before .. \nhope that helps,, \ncheers, k\n", "Q: Auto login with Kubuntu 14.10 KDE 5 plasma II've been trying to auto login, Kubuntu 14.10 KDE 5 plasma.

I tryied removing it and building the lastest version from the official GNUPG website downloading its source code (2.0.26), but I can't do it! it is always 1.4.14! and gpg generates this key: \n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1\nIt generates v1 keys, that's bad... I wan't the lastest version to generate my keys, is more safe, doesn't it?\nHow can I repair it?\nThanks in advance!\n(I'm using Linux Mint, but this happened in Ubuntu too)\n\nA: GnuPG 1 and 2\nFirst of all, GnuPG 1.4.14 is not really outdated, there are two branches of GnuPG developed at the same time. Also see Are gnupg and gnupg2 compatible with each other?\nOn Debian and derivated distributions, GnuPG 1 is installed as gpg, whereas GnuPG 2 is installed as gpg2 (but you might need to install the gnupg2 package).\nKey Versions\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1\n\nThis is not an OpenPGP v1 key, the comment just indicates that GnuPG 1 created it. Both GnuPG 1 and 2 generate OpenPGP v4 keys. You can see what format is actually used by running (no matter whether using gpg or gpg2)\ngpg --export [key-id] | gpg --list-packets | head\n\nwhich will output something like\n:public key packet:\n    version 4, algo 1, created 1356475387, expires 0\n\n(Not) Building GnuPG on Your own\nI strongly recommend not building GnuPG on your own. Apart from verifying sources, you need to regularly recompile to get security updates. Mint Linux already includes a fairly recent version of GnuPG 2 (2.0.22) with all security fixes backported, it should be totally fine sticking with that until a newer distribution will bring a new minor version.\n\nA: i dont know if this would help but if you use linux mint you can download it here http://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/gnupg2 or if you use ubuntu you can download it here https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gnupg2/\n\nA: Older versions of gnupg are insecure. \n\nGnuPG 1.4.23 released (2018-06-11)   important\nAlthough GnuPG 1.4 is of very limited use today we did a maintenance\n  release to address the critical security bug CVE-2017-7526.

My VM boots into live-CD of Ubuntu Remix Mini.\nHow do I install it on the VM's HDD?\n\nA: It isn't meant to be installed\nThe Ubuntu Remix Mini was build to create your own custom live-CD. As such it doesn't come with a installer. But ..\nYou can still install it manually\nAs per the Source: FAQ #35 Entry of Ubuntu Mini Remix. There is an guide from Nicolás Pierini.\nUnfortunately it isn't entirely complete and requires some Linux know how. This guide requires a working Ubuntu Grub installation from where it copies the /boot/grub-tree. Also the part about installing the grub MBR is missing. There is no explanation how to partition your drives and it isn't discussed how this would work in an  EFI environment.\nAnyway. I've transcribed this guide from Nicolás Pierini and added the part about how to get the UUID. Maybe someone wants to extend it and make it complete.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the filesystem to /mnt\n$ sudo mount -t squashfs -o loop filesystem.squashfs /mnt\n\n\n*Copy the whole squashfs to the hard drive. In this example mounted in /media/hdd. Check were yours is mounted and change all the commands below accordingly!\n$ sudo cp -R /mnt/* /media/hdd\n\n\n*Copy the grub directory from a fresh installation of Ubuntu. This needs to be the same version as the ubuntu-mini-remix. In this example mounted in /media/newUbuntu. Change accordingly!\n$ sudo cp -R /media/newUbuntu/boot/grub/* /media/hdd/boot/grub\n\n\n*Find the UUID of the hdd disk.\n$ mount | grep /media/hdd\n/dev/sda1 on /media/hdd type ext4 (rw,noatime,barrier=0,user_xattr)\n\nThe device path of the mounted /medai/hdds in this example is /dev/sda1. So do this to find the UUID.\n$ sudo blkid /dev/sda1\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"root\" UUID=\"a4645210-c1f9-4b25-91dd-aaa5051fed7a\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n\n\n*Open grub.cfg and replace the UUIDs with the UUID of the hdd disk\n$ gksu gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\n\n*Erase the root password and let users login without password\n$ gksu gedit /media/hdd/etc/shadow\n\nReplace root:*:14892:0:99999:7::: with root::14892:0:99999:7:::\n$ gksu gedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth\n\nReplace nullok_secure with nullok\n\n*Finished.

I discovered a few weeks ago that Google's Chromium browser for Ubuntu actually displays flash properly.\nBy default, the Ubuntu Software Center does not offer that program, but it seems there's an easier way than editing software sources.  I discovered that if you download the correct linux version from the page at the following link, it adds this software source to the sources list of the Ubuntu Software Center and proceeds to open the center and to install that browser.\nI have a few opinions about how the Ubuntu Google Chromium browser operates slightly differently from Chrome, but they could just be impressions.  I seem to get more breakthrough audio from ads on tabs other than the one I'm looking at, but as I recall that was a problem with Chrome as well.\nHere's the link I mentioned:\nhttps://www.google.com/chrome/browser/#brand=CHMB&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-sk&utm_medium=ha\nPS:  My sincerest apologies if you were specifically seeking advice to make that particular variant of the chrome browser work with flash.  By all I've read to date, nobody has solved its problem yet.\n", "Q: Eclipse luna missing titles after theme revert Lately I tried changing the colour theme of my Eclipse Luna to dark. Then I decided to revert back to the default GTK theme. But after I have done so, the title on the active edit window is missing (or are the same colour as that of it's background, I'm not sure). I tried editing the colours from the Preferences but as soon as I close the Preferences window, the title goes missing again.\nHere are some screen shots to help you get a better picture of what is happening.\n\n\nThis gets especially annoying since I can't see whether the current file has been saved or not until I switch to a different tab.\nI tried the obvious restart procedures with no effect, in case you are wondering.\nNote: I am working on Ubuntu 14.04 GNOME 3.8.4.\nEDIT:\nI tried changing the colour of every element in the list provided both from the eclipse directory via a text editor as well as the eclipse UI but the most I could achieve was change the background colour of the title, but not the text colour itself. Which exact key contains the value for the active title text colour?\nFinally, the thing is, when I tried changing the colour of each field, if it did not work I reset the changes then and there. But weirdly enough, when I hit the reset button, eclipse somehow changes the foreground colour to white. I don't know why or how. But I have finally fixed this.\nConclusion\nFor those of you facing the same problem. Just go to Window -> Preferences -> General -> Appearance -> Colors and Fonts -> Click on Active part foreground -> Manually set it to whatever colour you want. -> Hit apply.(Do not try resetting. Doesn't work)\nOn later inspection I have found out that this has been caused due to me changing the GNOME Theme to Dark causing the title to be somehow automatically changed to white to accommodate for a dark background; however that is not the case here(well, GNOME was expecting it I think).\n\nA: Might be something in the theme css file, check ${ECLIPSE_HOME}/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_X.Y.Z/css/e4_default_gtk.css\nThere are settings such as ColorDefinition#org-eclipse-ui-workbench-ACTIVE_TAB_OUTLINE_COLOR\nIt's the only thing i can think of that might cause this.\n", "Q: How can I start app before log on?

I've looked all over the internet for the answer.\nBoth of the answers work but there's a bug I can't fix that has something to do with these solutions.\n\nA: Prefixing the command with sleep 10 && should do the work if I correctly understood your question.

So I installed Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 (which included GNOME 3.10) and noticed that GNOME Software Center isn't included and isn't available through the repositories. Then I tried installing Ubuntu 14.10 (which included GNOME 3.12 stack) and, you guessed it, no GNOME Software center. Only the Ubuntu Software center.\nAny idea why the devs didn't include it even as an option? Isn't Ubuntu GNOME meant to be a vanilla-GNOME-type-of-distro? \n\nA: I would say it's because Ubuntu has it's own Software Center which is better then GNOME Software Center, in their opinion. Ubuntu GNOME FAQ says the following about it:\n\nWhy do you include Ubuntu Software Center instead of GNOME Software for installing software?\nUbuntu Software Center offers user ratings and reviews, screenshots, and better search. GNOME developers currently do not intend to support easy install of proprietary software like Steam or the Humble Indie Bundles.\n\nSource: http://ubuntugnome.org/documentation/faq/\nBut I'm pretty sure there is a possibility to install it, even though I can't tell you how.\n\nA: Gnome SOftware Center will now be available on 16.04 release to replace the current software center.

I just connected my new Rega DAC to the computer via USB, it popped up in the sound settings, and choosing it there directs sound to it just fine. What confuses me, however, is that it says \"Analog Output\". What does that mean in this context? I suppose the output must really be digital, since it works when it's connected to the digital input on the DAC, right?\nSorry if this is a stupid newbie question, I'm very far from an expert on Linux audio stuff, but I'm going to start learning, so I hope you can help me.\nBy the way, do I understand correctly that what I am communicating with in the sound settings is the ALSA layer?\n\nA: Everything on USB is digital.\n\"Analog Output\" describes the output of the DAC.\nUbuntu's sound settings are the PulseAudio layer.\n\nA: Analog Output means that the OS will first pass the digital stream to the inbuilt, computer DAC device (i.e. sound card), and then the analog stream will be passed on to the USB device for amplification and further to your headphones/speakers. The improvement in quality (versus the computer DAC) will be minimal, and will come only from the external DAC amplifier. \nDigital Output means tha the OS fiddles not with the digital stream and passes it directly to the external DAC device for conversion to analog, amplification, and then to your headphones/speakers. The quality should be much better, and will depend on the quality of the external DAC (since the inbuilt DAC will be completely bypassed). \nSee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I enable digital output on a FiiO E7 without ending session?. \n\n", "Q: Evolution Error: Cannot communicate securely with peer: no common encryption algorithm(s) For two days now Evolution reports the following error when I try to connect to my university’s mail-server:\nimap.server.name:993« gescheitert: Cannot communicate securely with peer: no common encryption algorithm(s).\n\nBefore this issue I had no problems with receiving/sending mails via this server.\nI use ubuntu 14.04 LTS and gnome-shell.\nSince I am a real linux-beginner I would prefer step-by-step instructions.\n\nA: This is a known bug. A fix is in the works. If it is urgent, you can enable the -proposed branch of the repositories (see How do I add the \"proposed\" repository?) and install the test version of Evolution uploaded (which contains the fix). Or you could wait a few days for the tested version to be released in other channels.\n\nA: I am having the same problem. There is a serious vulnerability in SSL that is causing people who run servers to disable support for a very old version of the protocol, and inexplicably it seems that Evolution only supports this very old protocol instead of much newer, safer ones. It seems that a fix exists, and Ubuntu needs to get on their horse and release a new package. I opened this bug about the issue, so you could follow that for potential updates.\nBeyond that, though, the best course of action is probably to sit tight until an update happens. You could try using a third-party PPA to install a newer version which may or may not have the fix, but as a beginner you might find that process difficult, and since the evolution packages are all tied to the rest of the Gnome3 behemoth, updating evolution generally means updating all of Gnome3, and having tried that before, I would describe it as immensely painful and unrewarding.\nOn the bright side, your university's IT team deserves some kudos for responding that promptly to the vulnerability.\n\nA: Your university disabled SSLv3 because of vulnerabilities in the encryption called the \"Poodle\" attack.\nThe thing is: An attacker might force you to use SSLv3 by aquiring a man-in-the-middle position (which is fairly easy e.g. on a wireless network). Then, when you try to read your emails, he will downgrade your encrypted connection to the mail server to SSLv3. This communication protocol is not easily breakable, but it does have some weaknesses, one of which was discovered recently: An attacker can keep guessing some bits at the end of a network package. And it will only take him a few (~1000) guesses until he gets the whole session cookie (the one authenticating your facebook (email, ebay, amazon ...) session so you won't have to enter your password every time you reload the page or follow an internal link) right. \nAt that time, he will be able to hijack your facebook (email, ebay, amazon ...) account. To prevent this from happening, server administrators are removing the option to use SSLv3 entirely. Almost every device supports better encryption protocols, so it is not really necessary anymore.\nIf you want to check if your browser is vulnerable to the attack, there is a test page here: Poodle Test\nApparently, evolution did update their encryption to not depend on SSLv3 anymore only recently. But the evolution version in the official repositorys is pretty outdated, which means that you COULD build evolution from source, but I personally do not recommend doing it. Another way is to enable the proposed repositories and install it from there, or just wait until the new version is moved to the official repo and evolution is updated via system update.\nSource:\nExplanation of poodle at heise.de\n", "Q: Is $HOME/.local/share the default value for $XDG_DATA_HOME?

How small can a installation with apt-get and Xfce/LXDE be?\nI tried several tutorials using Debian and Ubuntu, using mini CDs. No matter what I do, I end up with no less then 0.9Gb.\nStrikes me the fact that Damn Small Linux and Tiny Core can provide a functional desktop experience with <100Mb. Is there any way to have apt-get and Xfce/LCDE or even Gnome with less then, say, 200Mb?\n\nA: Have you looked at Puppy Linux ?\nPrecise Puppy is ~150Mb in size and you can use apt-get to install packages.\n(it is based on the Ubuntu Precise repositories)\nOtherwise there's tons of choice nowadays. Look for the ones that are Debian / Ubuntu / Knoppix based, you should be able to use apt-get with them.\nAs for the size, keep in mind distros like Damn Small Linux and Puppy can get so small only by stripping away as much functionality as they can, focusing on the bare minimum to run the system instead. These are the distros you'll find using using busybox and uClibc to save every byte they can. Feature rich environments like Gnome, KDE and even XFCE in this context push in the exact opposite direction, so you typically won't find them on a mini distribution.\n\nA: My laptop's running a ~ 1 GB Debian wheezy installation with an XFCE desktop with various plugins, and I haven't even tried to reduce it beyond cherry-picking packages in the packaging system from a minimal install onwards. Some of the obvious places to look are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you use languages other than English? If not, use localepurge and similar to hack away at /usr/share/locale which is > 150 MB\n\n*If you're on 64-bit and you know you won't be needing 32-bit versions of libraries, remove all of those, thereby reducing the size of /lib and /usr/lib\n\n*Will you be reading package and man documentation locally? If not, e.g. if you can rely on having a web browser at all times, then you might be tempted to remove /usr/share/doc and /usr/share/man\n\n*Do you know that you won't be changing your hardware? If not, use the inverse of your lsmod output to hack away at /lib/modules/ which could easily be hundreds of MB. Also, obviously, don't keep obsolete kernel versions around after upgrades\n\n\nNote that I wouldn't really be recommending some or all of these suggestions.

(Report a bug to possibly get one!)\nThis touchpad works by having that dipped area be its own button. When it is double-tapped, the Windows driver says \"Hey, I should disable/enable the touchpad!\". It then sends the disable or enable message to the touchpad, settings its state. \nWhen you reboot, power to the touchpad isn't lost. So, whatever state it was in is kept. When you fully shut down, power is lost, so the state is reset.\nAFAIK, there is no method to do this with that dip, at least kernel-wise. You may be able to write your own driver, but that is beyond the scope of this question (and possibly even this site).\nYou may be able to do a little workaround, which goes like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First off, find your touchpad in xinput-list.

I'm just about to reinstall that, but I'm beginning to wonder what other weird problems I'm going to run into, and how on earth I'll figure out what packages I need to reinstall to fix them.\nI've already tried apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, and dpkg --configure -a as per this answer, but they didn't seem to do much. Is there an easy way to figure out what I need to reinstall, or even just to reinstall all the xfce-related things, as that seems to be what's missing?\nMy virtual machine application supports guest OS snapshots, but I don't have any.\n\nA: If you install xubuntu-desktop, you will proabably recover most of what you lost.\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\n", "Q: Why opening apps in Ubuntu Touch takes so long? Why in current ubuntu touch images, the apps take so long to open? When I click on some app, the phone show the icon of the app selected and the \"icon of loading\". This is a bug, or is this how it works?\nThanks! \n\nA: When an application is loaded there's a sequence of processes which get loaded before and during the application startup. Ideally we'd like to have applications start from a partially started state (as happens on Android) which would be faster. Unfortunately at the moment we can't do that due to limitations in upstart & apparmor, but we hope to in the near future.\n", "Q: Grub Installation Problem using Ubuntu Mini ISO I have a problem when using the Ubuntu Mini ISO. It defaults installing grub on /dev/sda but that's my USB Flash where I'm installing Ubuntu from. How can I change that to /dev/sdb which is my actual drive? There is no option that I can change this.\n\nA: If you haven't installed Ubuntu yet, You could also use the advanced option during the installation process and select the target device for the bootloader as /dev/sdb (which is your hard disk). You will have to configure the other options too, but I don't think you will have a problem in configuring them. A simple google search for each option will present you with adequate information to install properly. Tip: Keep swap at 2gb. More than enough.\n", "Q: SVN export ignoring missing files, how? I have a large, old working copy of svn repository that I checked out long time ago. I'd like to export and save it preserving the directory structure.\nOver time, I've deleted most of the sub-directories and files at various levels as unneeded. I'd like to export the rest using svn export.\nHowever, the export stops unfinished due to errors like this:\nsvn: Can't stat 'WSN/Somedir': No such file or directory\n\nI'd like to avoid svn update due to following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The repository is old and not served any more\n\n*Even if it would be online, the missing directories are many gigabytes that I would rather not spend time and space downloading.\n\n\nOne solution I know is to copy the whole tree and to run recursive delete command that removes all \".svn\" directories.\nHowever, is there a cleaner way, to ask svn for export that ignores missing files and directories?\n\nA: If you run svn status, you will get a list of missing assets. They are signaled with the ! characters; e.g.:\n$ svn status\n?       default.cfg\n!       models\n\nIn this example the models folder was deleted and is thus marked with a !.\nTo fix this you need to delete these missing folders with svn rm; in the example this would be:\n$ svn rm models\nD         models\nD         models/model1.png\nD         models/model2.png\n\nThen commit and the export should work afterwards.\n\nA: Or you can revert just that sub directory.\nDo this by changing directory to the folder you want to revert, so you don't revert the wrong thing. Then enter:\n\nsvn revert -R .\n\nNow you can update and export as you like.\n", "Q: League of legends resolution problem I've got 1 GB Radeon R9 270X and League of legends  was working fine.

I change it to the ssd, but when i get to the end the system gives me an grub error that say \"fail when trying to install grub to hdd (sdb)\", where \"sdb\" is the USB. How can i fix this? \n\nA: You can most likely remedy this by manually installing grub on your desired HD.\nTry running this sequence exactly:\nBoot to a live try Ubuntu session, then run the following at a terminal prompt:\na) sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt # Make \"sdaX\" the partition that has Ubuntu install (i.e. /dev/sda2)\nb) for i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt/$i\"; done\nc) sudo chroot /mnt\nd) update-grub\ne) if no errors skip this \"e\" section\n     grub-install /dev/sdX (sdX is the hard drive that has linux installed (i.e. /dev/sda)\n     update-grub 5) Reboot the system\n\nAfter you have performed the manual steps be sure to set your computer bios to have your desired boot drive as the default boot device.\n\nA: Think i just solved the same Problem.\nWhen you're asked wheather you want to install Grub to the MBR select 'No'. It seems stupid but this will not cancel the grub-install process instead you will be asked to which device grub should be installed now. Enter /dev/sdX according to your needs\nI hope this applies. But I guess so as you're talking of a server.\nGreets\nFot Others:\nIn my case I was using the alternate Install of Lubuntu 14.04.1 i386(32bit).\nI guess it applies to the debian-installer (in ubuntu alternate-iso) in general.\nI'm experiencing it when I choose \"Expert install\" or \"Install\" but not when I use \"Install lubuntu\" because this will hide the pendrive and install MBR to the HDD\n", "Q: Installing python's numpy I am trying to install numpy.

My point is that if I reinstall the system on / partition, the new /home would be also on /... Now, when I'm installing something, it goes automatically to / and if I download or write something it's automatically placed in /home. Is it possible to indicate to the newly installed system, that the /home is on the other partition without reinstallation of /home (and having to copy the data twice).\nUPDATE\nI've tried the first solution from the Marty's Fried reply: I've installed / on previous / (\"format\" box checked) and /home on previous /home (\"format\" box unchecked). First I've give an other username than previously. Everything seemed to work fine, only I hadn't my home in my home (there was a new user home).\nI've repeated the installation, and now all my files are easily accesible, but the system is not working well. I wanted to start by installing classic gnome (I can't find anything otherwise) and I'm not able to open the terminal. There is just the frame of the terminal window, flashing and moving towards the screen. Is it possible that in my home partition there are some problems which may provoke this? \n\nA: One thing you should realize is that a lot of configuration is in your home directory, so you might find that you don't get the results you hoped for.  However, the repositories list is not in your home directory, so that part may be OK.\nTo do what you want, you can simply reinstall, and do one of two things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install normally, specifying the current root partition for the new root, and checking the \"format\" box; then specify the current /home partition for /home, but do not check the \"format\" box.  This will replace system-related files in your home directory, but not erase other files.\n\n*Install normally, as above, but only specify the root partition for everything, leaving the home partition out of the equation completely.  This will install a new home directory.  You can then mount your existing home directory with the new /home as the mountpoint.  This will hide the existing files, and if you have a problem, you can edit /etc/fstab to disable the mount, or mount it in a different mountpoint.\nOnce everything is working, you could either boot off a live CD to erase the newly installed but unused /home, or you could temporarily unmount it to delete the directory.  Just don't delete it while it's mounted, because you will delete the mounted files, not the actual file that are hidden.\nEDIT:\nMy opinion is I'd advise fixing the problem without reinstalling, if possible. It's probably not difficult, and you'll learn along the way. It's comforting to be able to fix things rather than reinstalling, and with Linux, it's not that difficult (unlike windows).\nYou may need to make a couple of posts, one for each problem, with more specifics. For example, the repositories are simply a list in a file, and you can either edit the file, or use synaptic, and clicking the menu \"Settings\", \"Repositories\". It's often easy to find which one is the problem, and remove it. Then refresh, and see if it fixes the problem.\nMore of my opinion:\nBecause there is so much configuration in the home directory that is release specific, I quit creating a separate /home partition.  What I have found to be more useful is to create a separate data partition, containing directories such as /Documents, Music, Videos, Pictures, Downloads, and whatever else I want.  Then, I simply create symbolic links for these directories, delete the folders in my home directory, and replace them with the symbolic links.  If you use the same names, and don't log out first, they will even have the special icons for those directories, and will act just like the originals.\nThe advantages of this method are that you don't end up with a lot of unneeded junk when you upgrade, you avoid problems with old configurations not getting replaced when you do, and if you use Windows, you can point the Windows equivalents to these same directories (assuming you use NTFS that Windows can read); also, if you ever try out other distros, you can quickly use your existing media files for easy evaluation.\nIf you are good at editing /etc/fstab, you could mount the directories instead of using links, but I find the links are easy to use, and have worked well over a long period of time.\n", "Q: curl .gz file and pipe it for decompression I am trying to download some .gz files (N.B. not .tar.gz ones) from given URLs and decompress them to overwrite existing files, if any.\nFor each individual download, I tried the following:\ncurl -O $URL | gunzip -f\n\nHowever, this did not work as it failed with: gzip: stdin: unexpected end of file. I ran a series of this command inside a bash shell script.\nIf I spilt the command into two explicit steps, i.e. first download the file, and then decompress the .gz file, it works.\nWhy the piped version does not work?\n\nA: Follow redirects when downloading.  Sometimes a web server has hidden redirects for security and/or random reasons.  If you don't follow the redirect, the wrong data gets downloaded and your application reading the piped data gets confused.  You can follow redirects with curl using the -L flag.\ncurl -L https://example.com/mygzip.tar.gz | tar zxv\n\n\nA: A pipe (represented by the | symbol) sends the standard output of one process to the standard input of another. In your case, you appear to want to use a named file so a pipe is not appropriate - specifically, there is nothing to pipe (hence the gunzip error) because the remote contents are going to a local file. Instead, you'd need to extract the name of the file - for example, from its URL - something like (using bash's built in string manipulation capabilities)\ncurl -O \"$URL\" && gunzip -f \"${URL##*/}\"\n\nIf you want to use a pipe, then the way to do it would be something like\ncurl \"$URL\" | gunzip -c\n\n(without the -O option) so that curl streams the remote contents to stdout from where it can be piped into gunzip, but then you would need to redirect the gunzip output to overwrite the target uncompressed file as appropriate.\n\nA: The below does 3 things \n    mkdir -p ${DIR} && curl -L http://apachemirror.wuchna.com/spark/spark-2.4.5/spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz | tar zxv -C ${DIR} --strip-components 1\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Force creates the destination directory \n\n*UnArchives the archive to the given directory\n\n*Replaces the root directory with the given directory name by simply stripping down the archive's root directory.\n\n", "Q: Sed Script - Reversing names I have a text file with several names that are arranged with the First name first, and the Last name second.

Note that only root can run the shutdown command by default. So, if you have not done any tweaking with the permission of running the command just put the cron entry in the root user's cron (sudo crontab -e) or add the entry in /etc/crontab mentioning the user as root.\nEDIT (Regarding Anacron): Absolutely bad idea. generally anacron is used while you want to run a command daily but you are not sure whether your computer will be On or Off. So lets say you have added an anacron entry to run a command. Then if the computer is On anacron checks and runs the command, if the computer was Off on that specified time the instant you turn On the computer next time anacron will run that command. \nSo, in a nutshell anacron is used while you are not sure your computer is gonna be On or Off. In your case you are shutting down the computer so if you put that to run by anacron your computer will be shut down by anacron if it was off and when you will turn it On after the specified time. \nYour command\n30 7 * * * root start -q anacron || : 30 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h now\n\nmeans that run 30 7 * * * root start -q anacron first, if that fails run 30 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h now makes no sense i think. Just add the entry in crontab and that'll do the job.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on a USB drive without it being a Read-Only filesystem? After my MacBook stopped working yesterday I have been trying to get it to work again, but right now it won't boot as there seem to be problems with the SSD. The support recommended booting into my MacBook using a USB-installation of an OS, so that I could back up my files, after which I would have to perform a reset. I used a USB-boot of Ubuntu to try to access my files. After booting I tried to navigate to my user files on the Mac's SSD, but I didn't have the permissions to access some directories.

You cannot write (that includes permission changes) to such a file system without jumping through some hoops and risking the integrity of your data, but I you don't need to either to perform a backup.\nSince the files on the OS X file system belong to another user as the default user on the Ubuntu live system, you probably need to access them as super user.

I have moved all of my development tools to Ubuntu. Now I'm taking a MASM class, and I need a MASM compiler very badly. I have seen some videos on YouTube. They mostly use a DOS emulator, and they install MASM compiler in there. I'm not really for looking something like this.\nHere is what I am looking for:\n\n*\n\n*Ideally it will have some logs to troubleshoot my programs.\n\n\n*Graphic user interface is a plus, but I don't need it.\n\n\n*I would prefer that the compiler is not an emulation of Windows (it would not need to use WineHQ).\nI'm currently using Sublime Text with a MASM package so I don't need an IDE, however if the solution that you have is an IDE that would be OK, like a lightweight alternative to Visual Studio maybe.\nWhat would be a good MASM Compiler under these circumstances?\n\nA: I would suggest jwasm (on sourcforge and on google code)\nThe google page lists a lot of alternatives and also shows why jwasm is better than these. Nelow a direct copy from the google code page so you get a good suggestion and you get alternative programs. You will need to try them to decide what works for you. JWasm works on Linux; all the others might not.\n\nJWasm \n\nFeatures\n\n\n*\n\n*Free. \n\n*native support for output formats Intel OMF, MS Coff (32- and 64-bit), Elf (32-and 64-bit), Bin and DOS MZ.\n\n*precompiled JWasm binaries are available for DOS, Windows and Linux. For OS/2 and FreeBSD, makefiles are supplied.\n\n*Instructions up to SSE4.2 are supported.\n\n*JWasm is written in C. The source is portable and has successfully been tested with Open Watcom, MS VC, GCC and more.\n\n*JWasm's source code is released under the Sybase Open Watcom Public License, which allows free commercial and non-commercial use.\n\n\n\nCompared to other assemblers\n\nMASM\n\n\n*\n\n*JWasm is free, no artificial license restrictions, can be used to create binaries for any OS.\n\n*JWasm is open source, forget the annoying MASM bugs ...\n\n*More output formats supported (Bin, ELF).\n\n*Optionally very small object modules can be created\n\n*Better support for Open Watcom, for example the register-based calling convention\n\n*JWasm is faster than Masm.\n\n\nTASM\n\n\n*\n\n*JWasm is available. TASM isn't legally available. And LZASM, which is sort of a TASM clone, understands IDEAL mode only.\n\n*JWasm has full support for STRUCTs and UNIONs. TASM has severe limitations and bugs in this area.\n\n*JWasm supports virtually all MASM v6 features (PROTO, INVOKE, hll directives, ... ), most of which TASM won't understand.\n\n*JWasm supports instructions up to SSE4, TASM is behind.\n\n\nPOASM\n\n\n*\n\n*JWasm is open source\n\n*JWasm additionally supports output in OMF, ELF and binary format\n\n*JWasm supports 16-bit and segmented memory models. POASM understands FLAT only.\n\n*JWasm is compatible with MASM's implementation of macros. POASM isn't.\n\n*POASM lacks the ability to create a listing file.\n\n\nWASM\n\n\n*\n\n*JWasm's macro capabilities are ways better than Wasm's.\n\n*JWasm fully supports Masm v6 syntax. In Wasm, most of the additions done in Masm v6 are missing.\n\n*Besides OMF, JWasm supports COFF, ELF and binary output formats.\nJWasm supports 64-bit.\n\n\nA: I think that it is important to point out that jwasm lack support for POSIX based calling conventions (System V like systems), so, if you are willing to use fetures like proto/procs with parameters, be aware that those parameters will be passed throught the registers by C/C++ compilers, but jwasm wont use the right registers but the stack as parameters so you won't be able to use parameters names as usual on 64bits architecture.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu as main os?

\n*\n\n*What is the objectName: property in QML?\n\n*Which components have this property?\n\n*Why is it needed? \n\n*How is it different than the id: property?\n\n*Why can't I just use the id: property instead?\n\n\nA: This property holds the name of the object. The objectName is a QString property of QObject which defaults to an empty QString.\nYou usually set this property when you need to find QML elements from Qt.\nBy this way the signals, properties and functions of a QML element can be accessed from Qt (C++) code.\nAutopilot tests use this property to introspect your application.\nFrom Interacting with QML Objects from C++:\nQML components are essentially object trees with children that have siblings and their own children. Child objects of QML components can be located using the QObject::objectName property with QObject::findChild(). For example, if the root item in MyItem.qml had a child Rectangle item:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\n\nItem {\n    width: 100; height: 100\n\n    Rectangle {\n        anchors.fill: parent\n        objectName: \"rect\"\n    }\n}\n\nThe child could be located like this:\nQObject *rect = object->findChild<QObject*>(\"rect\");\nif (rect)\n    rect->setProperty(\"color\", \"red\");\n\nNote that an object may have multiple children with the same objectName. For example, ListView creates multiple instances of its delegate, so if its delegate is declared with a particular objectName, the ListView will have multiple children with the same objectName. In this case, QObject::findChildren() can be used to find all children with a matching objectName.\n\nWarning: While it is possible to use C++ to access and manipulate QML\n  objects deep into the object tree, we recommend that you do not take\n  this approach outside of application testing and prototyping. One\n  strength of QML and C++ integration is the ability to implement the\n  QML user interface separately from the C++ logic and dataset backend,\n  and this strategy breaks if the C++ side reaches deep into the QML\n  components to manipulate them directly. This would make it difficult\n  to, for example, swap a QML view component for another view, if the\n  new component was missing a required objectName. It is better for the\n  C++ implementation to know as little as possible about the QML user\n  interface implementation and the composition of the QML object tree.\n\nIf an objectName is needed for testing, this is definitely worth it. objectName’s should obviously not be added when not needed. When adding them, the general QML guidelines for performance should be followed.\nSource: What is the impact on memory of adding objectNames to QML items?\n\nA: 1: It's used to lookup objects by name\n2: All of them, it comes from QObject\n3: It's used by autopilot to introspect your app from test cases\n4: I'm not really sure\n5: I don't think the id is discoverable from outside tools (like autopilot)\n", "Q: Postfix can send but not receive mail I just finished following this tutorial to set up a postfix mail server on ubuntu 14.04:\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-postfix-on-ubuntu-14-04\nWhen I tried sending an email to root@example.com from Gmail, nothing shows up in /var/mail.

In case those have been altered, here's the defaults that work:\nUsePAM yes\nPrintMotd no\n\n\n*Likewise, here are the defaults for the /etc/pam.d/login I've seen referenced:\nsession    optional   pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic noupdate\nsession    optional   pam_motd.so\n\nThat's everything I've seen referenced for troubleshooting. \n\nA: Add the following  line to /etc/pam.d/sshd :\nsession    optional   pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic noupdate\n\n\nA: In my case, it was because one of the scripts in /etc/update-motd.d failed to run (giving a non-zero exit code). Fixing it made MOTD start appearing again.\nIf you're unsure which one it is, just append a line exit 0 to all scripts in that directory.\nI noticed this on my machines running Ubuntu Disco and Debian Buster, but I am confident that it's applicable on Ubuntu Trusty (and even Precise).\n"]
