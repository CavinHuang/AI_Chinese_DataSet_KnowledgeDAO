["Q: Using startup commands when the default startup disc is not OSX I have to use a startup command (ie command - S for single user mode) when restarting my computer, but this is proving to be impossible, as the startup disc is windows by default on my computer - unless I hold option at start, I cannot choose to go into OSX, and when I hold the startup command I want without holding option, my computer just goes into windows - it doesn't work when I hold a startup command after I choose to run OSX, either. \nAdditionally, I cannot get into my system preferences to change the startup disc, as I cannot login (which is part of the reason why I need to use a startup command in the first place). I cannot change the startup disc on windows, either.\nDoes anyone have a fix for this?\nOS is Lion, w/ a 2006 Mac Pro\n\nA: You can boot to the Lion recovery partition by holding the option key during the reboot.  From there, you can select the startup disk, similarly to if you were running system preferences.\nFrom there, the single-user mode boot should work as you expect.\n", "Q: Move file to folder in dropbox How do I move a file from one folder to a different folder in Dropbox?

It connects fine to my schools internet and all my friends internet. But not mine!!! Again I am fully connected but my browsers never load the home page (AND my Spotify won't connect but that's not that important).\n\nA: From your question we can assume that you are connecting via WiFi and the WiFi icon on the menu bar is telling you that you are well connected.\nThe next step is to make sure you are getting a valid IP address. Open System Preferences > Network and click on the WiFi connection on the left. On he right it should now say something like \"WiFi is connected to AccessPoint and has the IP address 192.168.1.21\". There should also be a little green button next to the WiFi in the left hand pane.\nIf that is all ok then open \"Terminal\" and type \"ping -c 2 www.google.com\" and see if it then types \nPING www.google.com (74.125.237.179): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 74.125.237.179: icmp_seq=0 ttl=58 time=27.140 ms\n64 bytes from 74.125.237.179: icmp_seq=1 ttl=58 time=24.797 ms\n\n--- www.google.com ping statistics ---\n2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 24.797/25.968/27.140/1.172 ms\n\nyou know the network appears to be working well and the problem might be your browser.\n\nA: A couple of possibilities\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Apple menu and check that the location is set to Automatic: so >Location>Automatic.

Thanks!\n\nA: You can get the machine name with scutil --get ComputerName and the name of the boot volume with \nbasename \"`find -x /Volumes/ -type l`\"\n\nNote that both of these may well return a string containing spaces.

You can try this out in Terminal by running cd ~ or cd $HOME, which will take you to your home directory. You can verify by running pwd, which should output /Users/ followed by your username.\nFor the Desktop, you would use ~/Desktop or $HOME/Desktop.\n", "Q: System-wide SOCKS Proxy Settings? If I have a SOCKS proxy running on a specific port, is there a way to configure all network traffic to leave through it?\nIf I configure the SOCKS proxy in the Network system preference, it seems to work properly for all browsers without additional configuration. (As reported by a quick Google for 'what is my IP' in both Chrome and Safari.)\nHowever, a traceroute does not seem to be using this proxy, nor do downloads using curl. I also have no way of knowing whether other apps like Mail (SMTP) or an SSH connection are using the proxy.\nI found the app MacProxy, but it's only a 30-day trial. It seems like there is surely a way to configure this via the command line for free?\n\nA: There could be a couple of things happening here. OS X support SOCKS v5 but your SOCKS server might still be on v4. The difference is that v5 also routes UDP through the proxy but v4 doesn't\nTry traceroute -I destination which will make traceroute use ICMP echo instead of UDP and see if you get a different route.\ncurl should be using the proxy if you specify it.

I use iPhoto 11, and I'd like to backup the library, along with all the photos.\nI'd ideally like a continuous backup, by putting the iPhoto Library.photolibrary file / package in Dropbox. But I'm concerned that Dropbox may not preserve everything HFS+ provides, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Symlinks, hard links and aliases.\n\n*Resource forks and extended attributes.\n\n*File modification times. Imagine if iPhoto expects the library to have two files with one of them always having a modification time always older than the other's. When the files are synced to the cloud, and synced back to another device, does Dropbox guarantee to preserve the relative order of the modification times? If not, if I lose my Mac and buy a new one, the iPhoto library may be corrupt and unreadable (or things may appear to work but go wrong later).\n\n*Dropbox may have path length limits or may disallow certain characters in file names, etc.\nI could not find any definitive documentation from either Dropbox or Apple about this.\nAssuming that my reasoning above is correct -- that it's not safe to put my iPhoto Library in Dropbox -- that means that I can't have continuous backup.\nIn that case, I must do periodic backups, and hope nothing goes wrong in the meanwhile. Is it safe to backup the iPhoto library to a FAT32 filesystem?\nI found http://support.apple.com/kb/TS5168 but it says only that I shouldn't run iPhoto with the library stored on a FAT32 disk, not that I shouldn't back it up to a FAT32 disk.\nI also found http://support.apple.com/kb/ph2504 , which encourages us to back up to an external disk, but doesn't say if FAT32 is okay.\n\nA: Let me take a stab at actually answering the question.\nFirst of all, do NOT use a FAT32 drive to back up your iPhoto library. The library frequently contains aliases/symlinks, and FAT doesn't support those, so they would either result in duplicate photos (in the best case) or break a bunch of your photos.\nI don't think Dropbox has any limitation that would prevent it from backing up any/all normal files you'd store on Mac, which would include filename restrictions. Those would be a dealbreaker for any syncing cloud storage. So I think you can be confident there.\nDropbox seems to handle symlinks by turning them into duplicates. Other than that, people have been moving their libraries over to the Dropbox folder successfully. Here's a post to that effect – and in the comments are some common problems and solutions to this technique.\nI've also (through a post on Apple's forums) found an app called Insync which utilises your Google Drive account. They claim to support symlinks … in fact a large part of the draw is that you can create symlinks to anywhere on your computer and direct them to the Insync folder (which then goes to Google Drive). In other words, you should be able to create a link to your iPhoto library and it will make a synced backup, rather than having to actually move the library to a synced folder.\n", "Q: Map Parallels shared folder to drive letter I'm running Parallels 9 for Mac (OS X 10.9) and I have CentOS Linux (6.4) installed.\nI want to map a shared folder from my Mac to a drive letter in CentOS.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: CentOS (like all Linux distros) doesn't have \"drive letters\" - that is a throwback to the toy operating systems that were installed on some computers in the 1990's and early this century. I believe they went by the name \"Windows\".\nInstead it uses mount points.\nOnce you have installed the Parallels tools you can use the \"Shared Folders Tool\" to specify the mount point for the folders that are being shared from your Mac.\n", "Q: Is There An Alternative To Symbolic Links? I have an iMac and a MacBook Pro, both running the latest version of mavericks.. I want to sync files and folders outside Dropbox across the two computers. Up until now, I've been using symbolic links which I created via terminal. I've found that the symbolic links stop working after a while and I was wondering if there was a better way of syncing data between computers.\nPS: I use Dropbox as part of it. For example if I want to sync mamp databases across two machines, on my iMac I find the db folder, create a symbolic link for that folder, move it into dropbox, go to my MacBook and make a symbolic link of the db folder that's in Dropbox and move it into the mamp folder, delete the current db folder and replace it with the db symbolic version. That's what I want to achieve, I want to be able to sync folders outside Dropbox through Dropbox if that makes sense.\n\nA: There are are a range of third party tools for synchronising files across two or more computers. You mention already using DropBox.\nDropBox is designed to sync only one folder. Using symbolic links is a great work around but as you have experienced, the approach is likely to be fragile as it is not the focus of DropBox's developers.\nConsider using another synchronising approach that can handle multiple shared folders across your Macs.\nUnison File Synchronizer\nA stalwart of the file-synchronization world, Unison is designed for keeping two or more computer's files in sync. It deals with edge cases and is aimed at those needing more than just a routine copy between computers.\n\nUnison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows\n  two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on\n  different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified\n  separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in\n  each replica to the other.\n\n\nBitTorrent Sync\nBitTorrent Sync is relatively new and claims to need no cloud and share no private information.\n\nYour information stays yours.\nSync never stores your files on servers, so they stay safe from data\n  breaches and prying eyes.\n\nAeroFS\nAnother new comer is AeroFS. For private use a free plan is available. I am not sure how applicable this option will be, but it may offer more options, such as multiple shared folders, than currently offered by DropBox.\n\nDropbox behind the corporate firewall.\nFile Sync and Share, for the Enterprise, deployed behind your firewall\n\nrsync\nrsync is a command line tool included with OS X. You can use rsync to synchronise file systems with relative ease. Setting up rsync requires a scheduling tool such as launchd, cron, or Power Manager but once done it is extremely reliable.\n\nA: I think in your case, the best way to achieve this is to have Dropbox installed and running on both computers. That is, by design, what Dropbox does: sync files.\nEnable LAN sync, and as long as both computers are on the same local network, they'll sync without even the need to consume bandwidth.\n\nDropbox was design specifically for what you're looking to do. And since it works with OS X so seamlessly, it's by far the most elegant solution.\nAs an aside, OS X has had trouble with symlinks for several iterations. Even local symlinks break very easily and under numerous (most often mysterious) circumstances. It is a problem that is most certainly known to the more advanced OS X user base.\n\nA: The official Dropbox advice is to use aliases rather than symbolic links. Aliases are more robust than links as they can cope with either the source or the destination file being moved, for example.\n\nA: The absolute best way to sync files between two computers if they are always on the same network is to use rsync.\nHave a long, detailed read of the man page and visit its web page for more documentation.\n\nA: Try wml, it uses Facebook's Watchman to listen to changes in one folder and copied changed files to another.\n", "Q: Finder Global Grid Setting I'm running the latest version of mavericks and was just wondering if there is a way to set a grid sizes globally so that spaces between folder and files is the same throughout finder?\nAt the moment if I navigate through folders, the grid sizes are different in each folder .\n\nA: Yes, you need to set up a folder and then select the \"Use as Defaults\" button located at the bottom of the View Options window.\n\nOnce that is set, any new folder will adopt those settings. Note that any current folder view that has already been adjusted will ignore the setting and need to be re-adjusted. This is due to Finder saving view options instantly and not having the \"Use as Defaults\" option overriding them.\n", "Q: How to improve my mac mini performance I'am have a Mac Mini with 2.5GHz Intel Core i5.

If the man page starts something like \"BSD General Commands Manual\" it is almost certainly part of the original OS. You will notice that these will also end with a line that contains either 'BSD' or 'Mac OS X' at each end.\n", "Q: Why doesn't /proc exist in OS X?

As far as I know, this only happens under iOS7, never noticed it before that.\nEdit: Almost a year later and one iOS-version later, I am STILL noticing this bug once in a while. Still haven't found a way to replicate it.\n\nA: Having just spent the last 2 minutes or so spamming my volume buttons in various ways and not been able to reproduce this, I'm pretty confident that it's not an iOS 7 bug, or at least not an iPad iOS 7 bug.\nIt might be extreme, but you could try backing up and restoring the device, which should fix iOS problems such as this.\n", "Q: When does macbook second HD work?

Is there a way to see if the version of iTunes I've installed is the 32-bit version or the 64-bit version?\n\nA: On OS X, you can open iTunes and go to iTunes -> About iTunes and it will tell you. On Windows, you can get to the same dialogue by going to ? -> Info, it won't tell you though. You can open the task manager and if there is a *32 behind the process name, it is 32 bit.\nIt looks like the Installer is 64 bit but the application remains 32 bit on Windows. \n\nA: In answer to whether a 64-bit installation shows up, listed as 32-bit in the Task Manager, per https://discussions.apple.com/message/18034729#18034729: \nThat's normal on a 64-bit version of iTunes.

That no longer seems to be the case.\nEven though I delete every single file related to Safari in my user library folder, if I set the homepage to google, and delete all those files, it stays as google - a.k.a. does not revert back to Safari's default http://www.apple.com/startpage/\nIs there some other 'hidden' place Mavericks stores its settings for Safari?\n\nA: I don't have the reputation to ask a question, but sometimes deleting \"everything in Safari\" isn't sufficient. Malware of this type installs files in a variety of folders. Examples include the LaunchAgents, LaunchDaemons, PrivilegedHelperTools, and Extensions folder. You need to identify the malware first, and then follow instructions on where to look, and what to delete. Resetting Safari isn't sufficient when files located outside the \"scope\" of Safari (for lack of a better term) and spawning processes to be used by Safari.  \n", "Q: Renewing iOS Developer Program with Lebanese credit card Since I emailed apple three times now and shockingly got no response at all, I am laying out my problem here.\nI am trying to renew my developer program using a lebanese credit card that has a lebanese billing address.

Why are they not the same?\n\nA: If you have Time Machine Local Snapshots enabled (and I'm fairly sure it's enabled by default), then it's going to use some of your free space for creating these local snapshots. However, Finder doesn't take the space used by this feature into account, pretending it is actually free, because if the user starts filling up the disk, then the local snapshots get deleted -- it will only use `idle' free space, so to speak.

I want new the new update for my iPhone 3G (used as an iPod) but do not want to mess anything up. Can I update it without a computer? I also have no SIM card for the phone.\n\nA: No, you can't — you need a computer. Over-the-air updates were introduced in iOS 5. As the iPhone 3G can't run iOS 5, you can't do OTA updates, and therefore you need a computer to update it.\nAlso, 'the new update' (I presume you are referring to iOS 7) isn't compatible with the iPhone 3G, regardless of how you update.\n\nA: No but there is a way you can update to iOS 7 how cool I haven't dun it though\n", "Q: Can I restore lost photos fron backup?

I've always downloaded into the /tmp directory then installed to another directory.\nBut where is the place to install such applications? For example, I was just downloading MongoDB (a database application similar to MySQL).\nAnd I had no idea where to put it.\nWhere should such applications be installed on Mac?\nWhats the conventional way?\n\nA: As OS X is a UNIX OS at its core you can usually use the installers that come with the open source tools you've mentioned.\nQuite often there's some way to install them, usually there's 3 steps to configure, compile, and install the tools.\nFor stuff like databases and other UNIX tools they might need stuff in a number of places.\nIn contrast to that a typical Mac application will be just one self-contained application bundle that's supposed to go in to your /Applications folder.\nThough it can as well run from your Desktop, Downloads folder, etc. ...\n", "Q: Homebrew - Upgrading software in /usr/bin My OS X comes with a version of Git installed in /usr/bin. However, this version is older than the official stable one. I would like to upgrade it. \nCan I use Homebrew to upgrade this version? Or would Homebrew install Git in a separate location (and if I do so, how can I ensure that the new version is actually used)?\n\nA: Don't replace, modify or rename the system tools in /usr/bin. There are a number of reasons why this is a bad thing, and you can search for the specific reasons, but to be simple, don't edit the system versions.\nHomebrew knows this, and that's why it stores the tools in /usr/local/bin. This version is used instead of the system version since Homebrew requests that its directory be before the system path in the $PATH variable.\nRun brew doctor and you'll probably get a message like this:\n\nWarning: /usr/bin occurs before /usr/local/bin This means that system-provided programs will be used instead of those provided by Homebrew. The following tools exist at both paths:\neasy_install\neasy_install-2.6\n\nConsider amending your PATH so that /usr/local/bin is ahead of /usr/bin in your PATH.\n\nTo fix this, either add this to your profile:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\n…or add /usr/local/bin to the top of /etc/paths, such as:\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/local/sbin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\n\nA: Homebrew will install tools in /usr/local/bin so that it doesn't mess with the system tools that came pre-installed on your Mac. As grgarside mentioned, it's not recommended to alter the system tools.\nHere are more specific and detailed instructions for setting the PATH environment variable, which allows you to list several directories that you want your Mac to search in when looking for executables.\nIn order to use the latest version of git, or any other tool you installed in /usr/local/bin with Homebrew, you want to tell your Mac to first look in /usr/local/bin before it looks in the default /usr/bin. You do that by defining the PATH in your .bash_profile, which is a file that gets loaded automatically every time you open a new Terminal window.\nYou can write the PATH to your .bash_profile by running this one-liner from the Terminal:\necho 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\nThis command takes everything between the single quotes (echo) and adds it (>>) to a file called .bash_profile in your user’s root (or home) directory (~/).\nTo have these changes take effect, you can either quit and relaunch Terminal, or run this command:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\nIf you want to do it all manually, open your .bash_profile with your favorite editor, then add this line to it:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH\"\nand save it. Then quit and relaunch Terminal.\nUnlike grgarside, I do not recommend changing the /etc/paths file, because you would be making a global change, as opposed to a change that only affects your personal .bash_profile, and only while you're in a bash shell.\n", "Q: iPhone Cable or Accessory Not Certified This isn't a coding question, but it is an issue that affects my ability to develop iPhone apps. Beginning this morning, I began seeing the message \"The cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone\" whenever I plug in my iPhone 5's cable. I'm running iOS 7.0.4.\n(This is the cable that came in the box with the phone, and I get the same message when I use the cable that came with my iPad.)\nThe phone will still charge (as long as I have the correct side of the jack \"up\"; it previously didn't matter which side was \"up\"). But Xcode no longer recognizes the device, meaning I can't test with it. (iTunes doesn't recognize it either.)\nDoes anyone know what causes this issue and how to fix it? I didn't have this problem yesterday and have made no deliberate updates to the phone recently. And as I said, I'm using cables that were shipped boxed with Apple devices.\n\nA: As you can see in several threads like the one pointed by @Ohnomycoco, this is not a software problem but a hardware problem. \nLighting a \"smart\" connector with a microchip build-in the cables head. It's most likely due to a damage cable, so you'll have to replace it. \nAlso - be sure to test since in many cases it's the iOS device that needs repair and not the cable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only my cable can recharge my iPhone\n", "Q: Stop Excel for Mac (2011) continuing formatting from last cell entered? This drives me loopy. Sometimes (see below for when), Excel gets fixated on some cell formatting and starts applying it every time I fill in any new blank cell. \nI don't think this happens on Excel for Windows (though it's ages since I used the Windows version much). I'm looking for some way to stop it doing this. \nTo replicate:\n1: Set up a simple excel sheet with groups of, say, columns, and mark them as groups with formatting e.g. background colour.\n\n2: Fill in a row with some data (just type it in)...\n\nExcel decides that it likes that background colour so much, it's going to apply it everywhere from now on. \nIt's not just background colour:\n\nIt picks up the formatting from the last cell it entered text into, or the last cell formatted, then gets stuck and starts applying it after entering text to any new cell, like trailing mud across a carpet.\nIt doesn't only wreck things like columns: it also causes big problems any time background colour is used for anything meaningful e.g. to mark the status of a project:\nIn a blank cell... becomes... \n\nIs there a way to stop it doing this? To get Excel to stop applying formats to empty cells I enter text into, and just leave their formatting how it is?\nI've hunted through options and browsed online, but can't find anything related.\n\nSome observations: \nWhile creating the examples for this question, I noticed it looks like Excel is looking for patterns, then assuming I want to continue what it has decided to think is a pattern. \nIt seems to have two rules: \"One thing, something else, then that one thing again always means start doing stripes and never stop\"...\n ...or...  \n...and \"Two or more of something in a row when there has been a total of three of more of that thing always means carry on doing it forever\".\n ...or...  \n...but not... \nOh, and it does it even if you skip a row or column:\n ...  ... * sigh *\n\nI just want it to stop.\nPlease, help me make it stop.\n\nEdit - after turning \"Autocomplete\" off as suggested by Buscar, the same thing still happens, including after restarting Excel after changing the setting (checking the setting is still applied after restart):\n ...  ... \n\nA: Found it! It's a setting under Preferences > Edit: \n\n\nExtend data range formats and formulas\n\n\nMisread it as \"date ranges\" on the first trawl through preferences. Turning it off stops this happening.\n\n\nThe comment about formulas seems to only mean that it doesn't fill empty cells with formulas when it thinks it's seen a pattern. After turning it off, it still does other automatic format adjustment e.g. incrementing formulas copied across a range:\n\n\nA: It is correct that excel is looking for repeat pattern, and trying to help you by applying the last used = AutoComplete.\nIf you do not want it to do that turn that feature off.\n\n", "Q: Specifying DNS: Router or PrefPane? OSX Lion (10.7.5). Network preferences has an option to set up (and order) DNS adresses. My router (Bell Connection Hub - Bell Canda) also has an option for specifying DNS addresses. Which takes precedence in ordinary, vanilla browser requests? In other requests? Are there special situations/considerations? Thanks!\n\nA: If you specify DNS entries in your router's configuration, then any DHCP client of that router will receive those DNS addresses and perform lookups against them.\nIf you only specify DNS entries on your own Mac, then your lookup requests will be handled in the order listed.\nYou might want to consider running the excellent and free namebench to find the best DNS entries for your location and Internet connection.\n\nA: If you manually enter DNS server(s) in the Network preferences, they'll take precedence over the DHCP-supplied DNS server(s). And I don't mean it'll try the manual DNS server first and if that doesn't work it'll fail over to the DHCP-supplied server, I mean it'll ignore the DHCP-supplied server(s) entirely. There are, however, some complications:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have multiple network interfaces (\"services\") connected (e.g. both Ethernet and Wi-Fi), it'll use the DNS settings from the \"primary\" service (i.e. the one listed first in the Network preferences sidebar). So if Ethernet is the primary service, and you enter manual DNS servers for the Wi-Fi interface, they'll be ignored in favor of the DNS servers associated with the Ethernet service (but manual DNS server entries on the Ethernet service will override those supplied by the Ethernet DHCP config).\n\n*OS X's DNS \"resolver\" actually consists of a bunch of resolvers for different types of lookups. In addition to the default resolver (configured based on the network settings/DHCP/whatever) there are some built-in resolvers that ignore the regular DNS settings and do something else instead. Mainly, they are for things like names ending in \".local\" that get resolved by local multicast lookup (mDNS). So, for example, if you try to connect to \"something.local\", it won't ask the regular DNS server for the address, it'll send out a \"hey, is something.local here? If so, send me your address...\" to the local network(s). You can get a full list of these (as well as see exactly what server(s) are being used for regular DNS), with the command scutil --dns.\n\n*Programs that do their own DNS resolution... will do whatever they please. But mostly we're talking about programs like nslookup, dig, and host, which are specialized DNS query tools. General-purpose programs (like browsers) should all use the system resolver. (And BTW, nslookup, dig, and host all actually look at /etc/resolv.conf, which is set to the same policy as the default resolver, ... so they wind up following mostly the same policy, just without the multicast stuff.)\n", "Q: Outlook - Smart search Say I want to quickly find all emails by one person. \nIn some email editors you can type \"from: John\" and it would understand that you are only interested in messages that John sent.\nIs this possible with Outlook in OS X?

Click one of these (or just type them with the colon), and it'll search only that type of thing:\n\n\nOr, you can click in the quick search box, then click the \"From\" button in the \"search\" ribbon section that appears...\n\n...then type \"John\" in the different box that appears.\nLess typing, but one extra click.\n", "Q: rMBP Late 2013 Facetime HD Camera Not Working I have my rMBP since the end of December. When I got it, i needed to update the OS X to 10.9.1. I don't recall if i tried the FaceTime HD Camera later or before the system update, but i'm sure it was working back then.\nNow it doesn't work. At least it isn't stable. Some time it works, but very little times. When i turn up the PhotoBooth or any other software (Skype, Messages), the greenlight starts to blink repeatedly and that's about it. I can't see nothing besides black image.\nI've been reading in questions simillar to mine it this forum and others, but it seems people with a problem similiar to mine only happened in OS X 10.8.4.\nI read in a post ( https://discussions.apple.com/message/24030755#24030755 ) that updating the AppleCamera.plugin, located at /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/ would do the trick. I've tried that, but with no results.\nI've also performed a hardware diagnostics test. Didn't have any warning or error. Seems the hardware (the webcam in this case), is running just\nfine.

This should show when and how the $PATH variable is being overwritten.\n\nA: Check to see if you have this file: ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist\nThat file can be used to set environment variables for OS X applications, not just shell commands. If the PATH variable is being set in that file you will get all kinds of wonky behavior. This Apple Technical Q&A document leads me to believe the environment.plist file has been deprecated.

I am working with an application that utilizes a port below 1024 because it was originally intended to be run as root.  I would like to debug the app in an IDE which I open as myself (non-root user) but I do have sudo privileges.  I have reasons against remote debugging as well as opening the IDE under sudo.\nSo the only way for me to do this would be to allow a non-root user to use ports or a port below 1024.  Can that be done and how?\n\nA: Caveat: If your debugging only requires a single connection, and you don't need to specifically debug connect/disconnect events...\nYou could use netcat (or nc on some systems).\nYou set your application to open, say, port 12345 (user-openable). Then you use netcat to open, say, port 123 (privileged-users-only) and forward the data to port 12345.\n# sudo nc -l 123 | nc localhost 12345\n\nThe first half of the command runs netcat nc and tells it to listen -l on port 123. The pipe redirects data from the first netcat instance to another one. The second command connects to your application and forwards the data through.\nNote that as soon as you run this command, the second instance of netcat will connect to your application. If your application is going to start pushing out data immediately, you will want to connect your client very quickly, and will need to be careful about how data is buffered.\nIf you want the client to be able to disconnect and reconnect without having to restart netcat, then instead run:\n# sudo nc -lk 123 | nc localhost 12345\n\nThe -k tells netcat to keep running if the client disconnects from port 123.\nAgain, there's limitations with this method, as you're largely giving up control of the connection side of things by having netcat handle it for you. On the other hand, it's very quick and easy to set up and tear down, if that's all you need.\n\nA: If you can't change your app to use a port above 1024 then the easiest way would be to take the port it is using and map it to a port above 1024.\nYou can do that using the firewall, ipfw is the tool for setting the firewall. You could also do it using 'nc' - sometimes known as ncat or netcat.\nThere is a question here that gives more details. The thread also mentions \"AuthBind\" which is an open source package to that allows just this - opening ports below 1024 without granting root privileges.  \n", "Q: How can I launch a GUI app in Applications folder from command line? I would like to launch a GUI app that is in the Applications folder from the command line as opposed to clicking the icon in the Finder or in the Dock.

You'll need to run the actual binary:\nsudo /Applications/ApplicationName.app/Contents/MacOS/ApplicationName\n\n\nA: Just 'cd' into the application bundle, then into the Contents folder, and then into the MacOS folder. There should be an executable file in there which you can run normally. If there are multiple executable files in there, you could look at the Contents/Info.plist file inside the application bundle, and look for the entry CFBundleExecutable, which indicates the executable file that is launched when you double-click the application bundle in Finder.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Speech Won't Work Let's say i'm reading a book online.

Apple's instructions for completely erasing a system say to \"select your startup disk\". But my system shows a hardware drive icon and some gobbledygook as a name, and under that another icon and name that corresponds to the one I'm familiar with as my \"disk\". \n\nWhich of these is the \"startup disk\" I'm meant to erase?\n\nFWIW, when I attempt to erase the former, I get an error that it \"can't be mounted\"; but I can start the deletion process for the latter.\n\nA: One of these icons represents the hard drive (the one with gobbledygook as a name), whereas the other represents a partition inside that hard drive. Usually there's a single partition per drive, but some power users may have reasons to create more than one. If you fall into the default case of a single partition, and you intend on staying that way -- or just want to erase your personal data and don't care how the drive will look like so long as your data's not in there -- then just go ahead and format the partition (the one for which you can start the deletion process). All of your data will be gone; maybe there's also a recovery partition hidden from view, which won't be affected by this process, but it won't contain any of your personal data.\n\nA: You can select either of the icons you see and erase the hard drive that way. There is no noticeable difference but I have a habit of selecting the one with the name that is familiar.\nYou can erase the drive under the erase tab or also under the partition tab if you happen to be interested in creating several volumes from your disk.\n", "Q: Pendrive bootable not showing after trying to reinstall Mavericks I did the steps to reinstall OS X Mavericks.

It's (almost) the same when you install it from the GUI. \nSince the official website uses a form with a CGI, you'll have to download the installer from your browser. \n\nA: Did you try brew tab homebrew-science and then brew install hypre?\n", "Q: Why preview.app refuse to open local link in PDFs I'm trying to make a pdf with link in it to open local video files.\nI succeeded to do it with Acrobat, and Reader open the files correctly. But Preview.app refuses. Regular http link are correctly open, but not file://\nI need only Preview.app to make the finder launch the file, not open it inside preview. Since Reader.app can do this correctly, Does anyone have ideas how to correct this for Preview.app?\n\nA: I would not expect preview to allow this as a result of conscious design decision by Apple. This is in essence how one design decision of OS X was made different from Windows. One allows core programs that ship with the OS to do all sorts of things and the other attempts to embed security by controlling cross-program interactions.\nIf Preview.app could open arbitrary, document-specified files (or worse have Finder execute that action on behalf of the user), it opens the door for all sorts of security risks.\nApple's restrictions on permissions is based in part on the difference between local files (being more trusted, and perhaps operating with elevated system privileges) and files from the internet (which are quarantined, subject to less permissions to run locally). \nYou could file a bug report with Apple to ask how to accomplish a link, but my guess is that this is how preview was designed and not some oversight or bug that prevents this from working on the current build of OS X.\n\nA: This is probably just an oversight in Preview, not a security-oriented limitation. For example, Apple allows Safari to open any file:// or 3rd party URLs like evernote:// embedded in web pages. Similarly, the latest version of Pages/Keynote will open any embedded URLs too (though the iWork 09 versions did not.) \nSince URLs works in these apps, it's not a sandboxing issue either (Sandboxing is about restricting direct access to files, the file:// URL is still handled by Finder, not by the app where the click originated.)\n", "Q: RW mounted NTFS drive not shown in finder I mounted my NTFS drive in OSX with \nUUID=<some-uuid> none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse\n\nin fstab, but finder does not show the drive. I can do open /Volumes/drivename and will see the files and can even write on it. How can I force finder to show me the drive. (and the unmount icon)\n\nA: You should remove the nobrowse parameter because it tells the system that the mount point should not be visible via the GUI (i.e. on the Desktop).\nAlso, check your Finder preferences. In the \"General\" tab are options to show \"Hard disks\" and \"External disks\" on the desktop. In the \"Sidebar\" tab are similar options to show \"Devices\".\nIf this is an internal drive, the Finder will not show an \"Eject\" button, but you should be able to use Disk Utility to unmount.\n", "Q: Using rsync to copy data from one Drobo (NTFS) to another Drobo (Mac OS Extended (Journaled)) I have been using Windows 2008 in Parallels on my Mac Server to serve up files to my Windows clients on the network with a USB attached Drobo (NTFS). Now I want to move these files to my Mac Drobo (Mac OS Ext) and maintain as many file attributes as possible, such as date created and modified.\nRecently I learned how to copy large amounts of data using rsync on my Mac. I assume permissions will not translate, but can I use the same command to copy the data from a NTFS formatted Drobo to the Mac OS Extended Drobo and maintain file attributes/metadata?\nHere's the commend I used before:\nsudo rsync -va --progress /Volumes/SourceName /Volumes/DestinationName\n\nThank you.\n\nA: Check out the man page for rsync. In particular, the -a (archive) option you show will invoke the -rlptgoD options.\n\n\n*\n\n*-r, --recursive (recurse into directories)\n\n*-l, --links (copy symlinks as symlinks)\n\n*-p, --perms (preserve permissions)\n\n*-t, --times (preserve times)\n\n*-g, --group (preserve group)\n\n*-o, --owner (preserve owner (super-user only))\n\n*-D (preserve device and special files)\n\n\nPermissions can be preserved, but everything you copy will be owned by you unless you run under sudo so the -o option will take effect. Also note that without sudo, rsync gives you no special abilities to copy files that you do not have access to on the source drive.\nYou may also want to look at the -E option, but I don't know if it will work from an NTSF drive. Maybe it will preserve ACLs (if they exist on the source)?\n", "Q: Admin in Terminal, logged on Family's session I have a weird problem. I'm trying to connect on my VPN with Mac 10.7.5 (Java 7 U45, Citrix Receiver 11.8) but when I do, JSam is not able to write in Hosts file.\nSo my Mac session is called \"Family\" but when I go in Terminal and type whoami, I get: Admin. \nMy question is, is it normal and if not, how can I see \"Family\" in Terminal? Or, how can I give proper rights to Family or Admin so when I connect on my office VPN, Citrix will be able to write in hosts file.\n\nA: Host mapping - \"JSAM modifies the hosts file if you choose Automatic host-mapping under Users > User Roles > Role > SAM > Options > Java SAM Options\" (from here). Which is apparently running on the server side. If you are managing the server, try disabling host mapping unless you need it. At the very least, disable it temporarily and see if everything else works as expected. (If you can do everything you need without host mapping, then leave it turned off.)\nLooks like if hosts file modification is enabled, the client needs to run as admin or root (see here) and should be prompting you for the admin password for your account on launch. If your local account does not have administrative permissions, then it would not be able to modify the hosts file. You'd need to log in as an administrator, not a user.\nYou haven't made it clear whether Terminal output is from your local machine or the remote one. \n", "Q: Excessive horizontal mouse scrolling On a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.9.1 (13B42) with both the trackpad and a Bluetooth \"magic mouse\" I observe an excessive amount of (especially) horizontal scrolling.\nA trivial touch to the mouse (or touching the trackpad with two fingers) may result in dozens of (especially horizontal) scroll events. This is especially pronounced in Excel, Firefox, and Emacs (which notice horizontal scrolls) but not in Terminal and Outlook (which mostly ignore them).\nMouse tracking in system settings is set to the 3rd notch (out of 10).\nIt is possible to disable or reduce horizontal scroll events?\n\nA: Yes, you can disable horizontal scroll events. I know this because unwanted horizontal scrolling with the Magic Mouse used to drive me insane, especially with Adobe products.\nMagicPrefs, a \"free application […] to improve the functionality and configuration options of the Apple Magic Mouse\", indeed let me disable horizontal scrolling. It's somewhere in the \"Magic Mouse\" settings tab. Hope this helps.\n\nA: You can use the Scroll app to disable horizontal scroll. You can also specify a space on the bottom half of the mouse that allows horizontal scroll, and configure horizontal scroll to be enabled/disabled based on the frontmost app (using the menu bar in the app). Disclaimer: I'm the developer and the app is not free.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Multitouch app to disable horizontal scroll. Currently, this will disable horizontal scroll for all devices. Disclaimer: I'm the developer of the app, and the app is not free.\n\n\nA: The other setting that affects scrolling is \"Scrolling speed\" under Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad. From the documentation:\n\nAdjust the speed at which you scroll through documents and windows using the mouse.\n\n\nChange it for both Trackpad Options… and Mouse Options…\nUnchecking Scrolling in the same Accessibility preference will disable scrolling completely.\n\nA: My Specs - OS 10.8 MacBookPro - Adobe products - excessive and unwanted scrolling within the application. I can verify that the terminal route should be avoided (unless you know what you are doing) as it affects the operating system at code level. The second fix above (accessibility preferences) works but turns OFF the magic mouse scrolling universally - its useful for web browsing and you have paid triple for an advanced mouse... to turn it off? \nThe simple solution is to have a wired, traditional Mac Mouse (none Magic) attached to your keyboard - swap to this for Adobe work... takes seconds to alternate and you don't have to turn anything OFF. You will find one on ebay as Apple don't ship them anymore. Or you can put a dongled Windows mouse on the Mac (USB flash connector - wireless mouse) - in both cases the Mac will accept the none standard mouse using a base driver. \n", "Q: Why does my keyboard language switch on website password fields? Using a Mac with Mavericks, I have keyboard setup to Hebrew. Then, when I click in the password field, it switches it back to English and Hebrew is disabled.\n\n\nI saw that another question says to remove the keyboards, but I need to keep both Hebrew and US input methods active. I don't use quicksilver and wonder if something else might cause this problem on Mavericks?\n\nA: After doing a little bit of testing, I think it's because of this option is enabled in System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources:\n\nIt's checked by default and since cbs.com is in English, OS X will automatically change the input source to English (If you don't have English, or whatever language the page is in,  enabled, it seems it'll just select your default input source — i.e. the one at the top of the list in Input Sources).\nI tested with Hebrew and Danish enabled and when focusing a textfield OS X changed my keyboard layout to Danish with auto-switch enabled and didn't with it disabled.\nAt least in my case, the swithcing wasn't limited to password fields specifically (which makes sense). The behaviour is the same in both Chrome and Safari.\n", "Q: OS X 10.9.1, Mail 7.1; Mail: Mail rules reset with restart I am trying to use junk mail custom actions to add additional tags to mail identified as junk.

According to their support documents, LastPass is one such program that requires enabling access for assistive devices.\nAs a result, I wouldn't worry about the request.  As you suspected, it is probably LastPass, and everything is working normally.\nIf you want to know more about GUI Applescripting, check this out:\nhttp://www.macosautomation.com/mavericks/guiscripting/index.html\n\nA: This LastPass Support page indicates that this is expected and explains your various options:\n\nChrome now requires that we ask users for permission to communicate\n  with our new native messaging host.\nSo, if LastPass does not detect the binary component the first time\n  that you click on the LastPass button, we prompt you for permission. \nIf you:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click deny, LastPass will never prompt again\n  \n*Click accept, LastPass will pop a confirm box stating that if you have not done so yet, you will need to run the universal installer to\n  install the binary component\nThen:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*if you click OK, we redirect to the binary component which downloads in the browser.\n  \n*if you click Cancel, then we do not download the binary installer.\n\n", "Q: Forced switching between Spaces when opening Microsoft Office files Since time immemorial, opening a Microsoft Office file has had the side effect of restoring an already-open window in the same application before displaying the newly opened file's window.  This was mildly annoying for multitaskers who minimized windows associated with tasks other than their current one, forcing them to re-minimize a window not relevant to the task at hand.\nI suspect that this same behavior is now to blame for a truly maddening side effect when using Spaces with a different space for each task:  Opening, say, a Word document still causes the most recently active Word document window to be brought to the front, so if that window is in a different space, Spaces switches to that space-- a context-blowing action.\nFor what it's worth, I'm using Office 2011 on Mountain Lion, though the behavior seems to be the same on Mavericks and previous versions.  I've already unchecked the Mission Control options, \"Automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use\" and \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for that application.\"  This seems to work for most apps-- e.g., opening a PDF file in Adobe Reader when another PDF file is already open in a different space doesn't trigger a switch to that space-- just not MS Office.\nDoes anyone know of an Office setting or hack that would prevent this?\nThis question is probably related to Microsoft Word Forcing “Spaces” Switching.\n\nA: I've long experienced this problem, too. Haven't found any 'good' solutions, so put together some Applescripts that partially address the problem.  It's very much a kludge and not a perfect solution, and deploying the scripts in a given user's workflow is a matter of individual taste.\nHere's code to open an MS Word document in a space that doesn't have any Word windows without first triggering a shift to a space with a Word window open:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Microsoft Word\" to tell menu bar 1 to tell menu bar item 3 to tell menu 1 to click menu item 1 --open\ntell application \"Microsoft Word\" to activate\n\nAnd this script will close an MS Word document without triggering a switch to another space (if it was the last Word window open in the current space):\n--Is there another window of the app in this space?

I was always under the impression there is no charge associated with using push notifications but this suggests otherwise:\nhttp://mashable.com/2013/07/03/mobile-data-travel/\nIf a user receives a push notification, especially when in a roaming situation, is there a charge associated with that, even if indirectly as a consequence of the push bumping up the amount of data they have used and thus potentially incurring data overage charges?\n\nA: Push notifications will mean charges are incurred if you ever pay for data. Clearly, most push notifications are very small transmissions, but they almost always use data connection instead of WiFi so if you had thousands of pushes, it might be the bit of data that exceeds your quota and racks up more cost. Also when roaming, all data might be metered a la carte, so you would in essence pay for each notification you received while roaming.\n\nAs outlined in the comment by Matthieu.\nPush notifications are data.  If you are \"roaming\" (ie. outside the country where you have your service contract with your mobile service provider) you will incur charges.\n\nHaving said that there are plans which allow for free data roaming globally.  Such as the T-Mobile plans available in the US. This has something to do with the fact that T-Mobile is Deutsche Telecom.  On such a plan there will be no charges.\n\nA: To add to Deesbek's answer, you can of course turn off data cellular data in the Settings app:\n\n", "Q: How to change Skype language on iPad I have an iPad with Settings->General->International->Language set to Hungarian.

So, I charged it, after a few minutes it turned back on, and I looked at the battery symbol and it had said that it was at 62% battery life.\nI was somewhat confused, as just moments before it was completely dead. I left it to charge for a bit before taking it off charge to charge my iPod.\nThe next morning the iPad was dead again. I put it on charger and all that happened was the logo would pop up, fade away, and repeat. I left it alone to charge and when I tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I've only had the iPad for two months, and this is the first time anything like this has happened.\nIt hasn't been dropped or damaged at all, at least to my knowledge. Any advice? I really don't feel like spending money at the Apple Store for them to tell me it's just some fault in my charger or something. I've tried most everything, including the Home/Sleep-Wake button reset.\n\nA: If you are not near an Apple store or Authorised Service Provider then call up AppleCare (apple.com/contact) and they will help you try a few steps and if they come to the conclusion that your iPad needs to be swapped then they will send you one. Pretty sweet deal. I encourage purchasing AppleCare+ as well while you talk to the phone agent because you have a small period of time to purchase it and it is a fantastic investment.\n", "Q: Trying to connect Pegasus Raid 4TB to MacBook Pro MBP does not see the Raid. I also have an iMac 27\" connected to the Raid with a thunderbolt cable, works fine.\n\nA: You are attempting the impossible. You can't connect two Macs to the same Thunderbolt chain. The two Thunderbolt ports on the Pegasus are so that you can daisychain devices, not Macs.\nSecond, the Pegasus you have doesn't talk Ethernet.\nYou could use the second port to attach a display or another disk device but not a Mac.\nSince your MacBook Pro doesn't have a Thunderbolt port you can't connect it to the Pegasus directly. You could use a Thunderbolt to FireWire cable, but even then not at the same time as it was connected to the iMac.\n\nA: I would break things down and add one piece at a time.\n\n\n*\n\n*disconnect all cables and power on all devices\n\n*pick one Mac and open System Information\n\n*refresh the thunderbolt display to see nothing is connected\n\n*connect only one thunderbolt cable to the RAID\n\n*refresh the System Information thunderbolt pane - ensure the drive is seen\n\n*eject the drive and disconnect the cable from the Mac\n\n*plug the cable to the other Mac (having System Information ready to confirm it connects)\n\n\nWithout knowing which Pegasus RAID you have - it's hard to know how to troubleshoot the ethernet issue, but you could certainly ask a second question once you're convinced both Mac can see the RAID when only one connects. My suspicion is you can chain many drives to one mac, but not introduce a second Mac anywhere in the chain and have it participate with the storage unless it is in target disk mode itself (in which case it will be just another drive in the chain).\n", "Q: Hard drive Ejects itself while running ddrescue I don't know who to blame apple or ddrescue.\nSo Sorry if this is in the wrong place! :)\nI have\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook pro Intel core I7 running Maverick\n\n*Failed 120Gb HDD (really old... more than 8 years I think)\nSo Natural I run ddrescue.

There is a old trick where you place a defective hard drive in an ESD safe bag and store it in the freezer for a couple hours. Once the metal is cold through the bag then try accessing the files again. You might have luck without ddrescue (which I am not aware of or experienced with) and the drive might just show up in Finder. However if it doesn't or it keeps ejecting and remounting you could drive a different computer or send the disk into specialists for data recovery.\nCheers\n", "Q: Why does my 10.8.5 OS X not recognize my iPod when I plug it in? Just today, I plugged in my iPod Classic (bought recently; 160 GB), and it doesn't charge or show up in iTunes. Its screen turns on though.\nI have OS X 10.8.5, and the latest iTunes on a MacPro 2008.\nI can plug it into my wife's iMac (2011) using the same cable and it seems to work fine.\nSo I reset the SMC, and the PRAM. I reinstalled iTunes twice, and restarted the mac. The only thing that changed was immediately after resetting the SMC, plugging in the iPod had it show up as connected on its screen for a few seconds, then it said \"OK to disconnect\" and now doesn't respond any more. I also tried plugging it into the other USB ports, including the ones on the Apple Keyboard.\nIt looks like the problem is that the Apple Mobile Device Service doesn't start up. I can find Apple's support article on how to reinstall it on 10.6.8 and lower, but that doesn't help.

Very annoying. How do I disable (or re-assign) the double-click to launch/play in iTunes command? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: In the Finder?  You can't.  That's what double-clicking does.  To rename, single-click after selecting the file, or press return.\n\nA: I suspect you are clicking too fast.\nA 'Double-click' in Finder opens the file or launches the application, etc.\nOn the other hand, selecting a file/directory, waiting a short period, then clicking again, will allow you to rename it. It's not technically a 'Double-Click' even though you are clicking twice (you could equally use arrows to navigate to the file, then click, for example).\nYou can alter that delay in System Preferences under the Mouse preference pane. The 'Double-Click speed' slider lets you adjust this. Perhaps you should move the slider closer to the 'Fast' end, which will reduce the chance of it assuming you meant to open the file instead of renaming it when clicking twice.\n\nA: You can prevent iTunes from opening when you double-click on a track by telling the Finder to open some other Application when you double-click on an mp3, or whatever, music file.\nA simple Applescript such as\n\nsay \"beep\"\n\nwill do the job. Just open Applescript Editor, type the above script, and save it as an Application, e.g. \"Beep.app\".\nThen do a get-info on a music file, and set the \"Open with\" option to \"Beep.app\" instead of iTunes. Now try double-clicking on the track. You should see an expanding icon, like the file is opening, but nothing further will happen because \"Beep.app\" doesn't actually do anything with mp3 files. (Activity Monitor shows Beep actually opens for a few seconds, but it takes up no cpu, and the script itself doesn't execute.)\nOnce satisfied that the script is working properly, you can go back to your mp3 file's get-info window, and click the \"Change All\" button to open any double-clicked mp3 with Beep.app instead of iTunes.\nThat'll stop iTunes from annoying you when you're just trying to change a file's name.\nclick the \"Change all\" button to use the \"Beep.app\" to open all mp3 files\nIf you don't want the beep, you could even make the AppleScript do nothing:\n Tell Application \"Finder\"\n End Tell\n\n", "Q: Plex Media Server for Mac with a Pansonic Viera TC-P50S30 I have a Panasonic Viera TC-P50S30 that is connected to my home network with a wired connection. I also have a MacBook Pro that is running Mac OS 10.9.1 and Plex Media Server 0.9.8.18 and connected to the network with a wireless connection. Despite the seemingly simple setup, when I go to the DLNA Server option on my TV, I get an error message that says \"DLNA server not found\".\nDoes anyone know what steps I can take to try and troubleshoot this issue?\n\nA: First, make sure you have the firewall turned off on the Mac.\nCan your TV pick up anything else on the net?\nNext, make sure that your router is broadcasting UDP packets. Some routers do not, they swallow UDP.\nNow check that Plex Media Server is running right and listening for connections. At the command line:\nsudo netstat | grep 'Plex'\n\nThat should give you a list of ports that it is using. They will include:\nTCP 32400     (for access to the Plex Media Server)\nUDP 1900      (for access to the Plex DLNA Server)\nTCP/UDP 32469 (for access to the Plex DLNA Server)\nUDP 5353      (for Bonjour)\n\nSo then you know that it is up and running.\nMake sure both your TV and Mac are thinking they are on the same subnet and that the netmask is correct on both.\n\nA: I would recommend not using DLNA but some other means of streaming your movies.\nI have quite a bit of experience trying to set up DLNA with a media server and our SONY Bravia.\nThe TV had no issues connecting to our physical media server via wifi or the internet, I just could not get DLNA to work. The ports were open etc. etc. I ended up even sniffing traffic but no go.\nAfter about two weeks of trying to get it to work, I read enough about it being buggy that I gave up.\n\nHaving said that, it was over three years ago and back in Australia so the technology out there is probably a lot more mature by now.\n\nA: This is ancient but since I have a similar setup, I'll chime in. You need to be sure you have DLNA enabled and setup on Plex Media server under Advanced options-DLNA. If this is setup correctly your viera will pick it up. *Note you miss out on plex best features by running it this way but this will correct the issue \n", "Q: Adjusting the beginning of a track on garage band I would like to remove several seconds from the beginning of my garage band project. \nThere are several tracks and when I delete this portion off each track  I end up with 5 seconds or so of just dead air. \nI've tried dragging each track back to the beginning but it just puts the stuff back in I was trying to eliminate. \nHow do I forward the beginning of the project ahead to eliminate this?\n\nA: You need to grab the middle of the track, not the edge, and pull it back to the point where you want it to start. You can move all your tracks at the same time by selecting all of them with Cmd-A and then grabbing some place in the middle of the track and pulling them back.\nIf you're grabbing your tracks in the correct spot to move them on the track arrangement grid, your cursor will stay as an arrow instead of turning in to a bracket-type icon which indicates you're extending or shortening the length of the clips, not moving them on the grid.\n\n", "Q: Truecrypt error: the OSXFUSE file system is not available (255) My truecrypt files were mounting fine until today when I tried to mount it and I got the error: the OSXFUSE file system is not available (255).

I tried deleting macfuse and osxfuse and redownloading both but it still doesn't work. The weird thing is when I remove OSXfuse it says it is not available (-1) and when I have it says the same thing but with (255). Is there anything I can do to get my files back? I am on mavericks if that matters.\nThanks!\n\nA: I had a similar problem today. I installed osxfuse and ntfs-3g via Homebrew, but I didn't install the kernel extension. I got a similar error message trying to mount an NTFS drive in RW mode. After installing the osxfuse kernel extension (instructions are available via brew info osxfuse), the error went away.

I have a mid-2009 MacBook with 4 GB of RAM installed in it and I'd like to upgrade it to 8 GB of RAM. In order to do that I have to figure out what the installed RAM configuration is so I can determine what it is I need to order.\nHow do I see the installed RAM configuration in the MacBook without opening it up and actually looking inside?\n\nA: You can see the current RAM configuration in a visual overview by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going to the  menu\n\n*About this Mac\n\n*more info\n\n*memory\n\nIf you'd like further detail, open the System Report... from the Overview tab of About this Mac.

It is incredibly powerful and is high on my recommended list.\nIt's $35 but there is a free trial.\n\nA: Alfred with the PowerPack also lets you define snippets which are easily pasted anywhere. TextExpander as Tony Williams mentioned is a bit more convenient, but Alfred is cheaper and can do a lot more than just expanding snippets. \n\nA: there is a built in function in iOS and keyboard settings for Mac that offers shortcuts enter a shortcut and the phrase it expands into when you type the shortcut and a space afterwards.\nit doesn't allow for line-breaks however\n\nA: I, personally, like the freeware XMenu from Devon Technologies:\nhttp://www.devontechnologies.com/products/freeware.html\nYou define snippets by making a text clipping and placing them in a particular folder. The clippings menu resides in your menu bar.\nIt's also got a nice launcher a'la NowMenu.

You can try it out for free, however.\n", "Q: Repairing/ Fixing/ Finding parts for very old Macbooks? I'm using a Macbook Pro 13\" mid 2010 model and I recently had a visit at the service centre to purchase a new battery. Out of curiosity, I initiated a conversation to understand more about repairing older, or very old Apple products and the technician mentioned it \"could\" be hard or impossible to find parts for very old Macbooks. She referred to very old macbooks as Vintage macbooks. So any apple product whose manufacturing date exceeds 5 years from any current date qualifies as a Vintage product.\nI'm not sure about the technician's words. I understand not many might want to continue with very old hardware, and rather buy a newer product. But, is it really hard or impossible to find parts and repair very old macbooks? More precisely, how easy would it be to find parts for, or get a 12 year old macbook repaired?\n\nA: The technician used proper terminology per Apple.  Apple defines a vintage product as one that was discontinued more than 5, but less than 7, years ago.  Apple defines an obsolete product as one discontinued more than 7 years ago.\nYour Mac is 3 1/2 years old, thats not yet very old.  With Apple notebooks I typically expect about 6 - 7 years of solid use.  Right now a 7 year old MacBook Pro can still run Lion, which is still fully supported by Apple, thus, in real world terms, making it not yet obsolete, even by Apple’s terms.\nWhen it comes to finding parts for a Mac that fits Apple’s definitions though, that becomes tricky if you insist on “new” parts.  I emphasize new because any of Apple’s service parts for Macs over a year or two old carry a high likelihood of being reconditioned, meaning they were returned to Apple through service channels, diagnosed, fixed, strenuously tested then re-certified for use.  Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASP), including AppleCare & Genius Bar, are able to still order parts for vintage Macs, but that part supply is no longer replenished.\nSo, say you need a logic board for a vintage MacBook, an AASP can place an order for a logic board and if one is still in stock then the order will be fulfilled.  If none are in stock then the AASPs (non-Apple only) only other option is going with one from a non-Apple source, whether it be a spare they have or from another reseller. \nIf you need a logic board for an obsolete MacBook then an AASP (non-Apple only) only has the option of finding one through another reseller or using a used spare they have on hand.  Situations like this are typically the reason a lot of old Macs get retired.\nWhen it comes to sourcing parts on your own there are several reputable vendors that deal in refurbished Apple parts. A few examples:\niFixit - iFixit is also a tremendous resource for walk throughs for the majority of repairs you might encounter with just about any Mac.\nPowerBook Medic\nMacFixiIt\neBay is also a handy resource although, as always, exercise caution and proper sense when buying from eBay.\nAs to your specific question, of how difficult would it be to find parts for and repair a 12 year old MacBook... As of right now the oldest MacBook is just shy of 8 years old, so we can't answer your exact question.  However, finding parts for and repairing that 8 year old MacBook is still quite possible in most cases, although many would find it cost prohibitive, meaning they would rather put the $200-400 towards a new or used Mac rather than fixing an 8 year old model.\nThere ARE 12 year old PowerBook G4s though, and those follow the same idea I laid out in the previous paragraph.  Repair is often possible, although finding logic boards seems to be a bit tougher these days, but it often doesn't make financial sense to repair rather than to replace.\nSource - I worked in the Apple break/fix ecosystem for 6 years, for both an AASP and as a Mac Genius.\n\nA: iFixit still sells parts for the PowerBook G4 Titanium series. They have featured products, which lists an extension cable, Airport cards, the PRAM battery, the logic board, and the AC Adapter. Further digging reveals that they still sell the OS 9 install discs, extra RAM, and the optical drive.\n\nThe PowerBook G4 was first introduced in 2001, so 13 years ago. If you're worried about keeping old hardware running, I wouldn't worry too much about it.\nFirst, iFixit will probably still sell parts for your MacBook for a long time (based on the fact that they still sell PowerBook G4 parts). Second, if you find yourself stuck without a part, I'm sure you'll be able to find parts on Ebay that will work just fine. Macs run for a very long time. I have 15 year old (almost) Macs that are still running and working just fine. I also know people who have Mac laptops from more than 20 years ago and they are still running.\n", "Q: sync mail folders between desktop and iphone I access two different gmail accounts using IMAP in Mail.  I organize those accounts into folders on my Mac (both gmail accounts go into the same folders).  As soon as I put an email into a folder, I can no longer access it on my iPhone.  Is there anyway to sync my folders with my iPhone as well?\n\nA: The problem you are having is because the folders are on your Mac rather than in one of your Google accounts.\nIf you want to be able to read the emails on your iPhone they will have to be on the Google IMAP server.\nCan I suggest you get one of the two Google accounts to forward its email to the other account. Then you could put the folders in that account and they would be on the Google servers and accessible from anywhere you want.\nYou can even set it up so that you can choose which of the two accounts is sending any email you send, even from the one account.\n\nA: You don't have to have them all in IMAP when you create the sub folders and sort emails into them.\nInstead of creating those sub folders under \"ON MY MAC\", you can create them under \"ICLOUD\". As long as your computers and devices are iCloud enabled, they all share the folders in ICLOUD.\nJust bring mouse over ICLOUD and you will see \"Show\" shows up on the right. Click on \"Show\". You may see only the \"Draft\" folder initially. Ctrl-left click, mouse-right click or Mailbox menu will show \"New Mailbox\" option.\nThe folders created in ICLOUD will be shared between all ICLOUSE devices.\nYou can also MOVE the old folders into ICLOUD (the local folders will be deleted) or COPY mails into new Folders created under ICLOUD.\nIf you are moving or copying into ICLOUD and have got a lot of mails and many/large attachments, this may take a long time and need a lot of data bandwidth. Do it, only if and when you can.\n\nA: What you need to do is open your Hotmail, Gmail, or what ever mail account you have through Safari browser or MSN and all your folders will appear in them as usual.

I have an issue with my iPad 4.\nHere is a little background.  I recently broke my screen, so I took it to one of those you break it i fix it chains and they replaced it and things were working great for a few weeks. However, I ended up taking it back (because a home screen was slightly dented in after the initial fix), so they fixed it yet again, but after that I found a dead spot on the screen.  I took it back, then they called me a few days later claiming they have changed the screen 4 times, but the issue was still persistent, so now they think it may be the motherboard.\nI know my questions will be slightly generic, but has anyone heard of dead spot issues being cause by a faulty motherboard?\n\nA: I haven't heard about such an issue and I can't imagine about a dead spot caused by the motherboard. Is it just one pixel or a larger spot? What does it looks like?\nBut I can imagine that the service haven't changed the screen.

It can open files perfectly fine but when I try to browse through a folder from within the Xee app, it has to request permission. (See the screenshot below.) I have to do this for every folder the first time I browse it.\nI assume that this is a limitation imposed by the app store. Is there any way to circumvent this and grant an app (installed on my machine) permission to view any directory, or even to do anything at all that it wants?\n\n\nA: It's a bit tricky but, but you can remove the sandbox by changing the <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key> value (which is set to <true/>) with a hex editor.\nIn macOS Sierra 10.12 set it to into <false/>\nIn macOS El Capitain 10.11  or earlier set it to <fals/>\nFor Xee you need to edit the following binaries:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications/Xee³.app/Contents/MacOS/Xee³\n\n*/Applications/Xee³.app/Contents/Loader/Xee3.ImageLoader\n\n\nSource: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7018354/remove-sandboxing\n\nA: The app is sandboxed. This means the application has been code signed with a set of entitlements. These entitlements are being enforced by Mac OS X. Apple's developer documentation on sandboxing provides more detail.\nYou can view Xee's sandbox entitlements using the following Terminal.app command:\ncodesign --display --entitlements - /Applications/Xee.app\n\nOle Begemann's article, Checking Code Signing and Sandboxing Status in Code, explains more.\nResign or Strip Entitlements\nTo remove the entitlements, you need to re-code sign the application without entitlements - using codesign - or entirely strip the code signing from the application.\nAsk Xee's Developers\nModifying a Mac application is not recommended. Ask Xee's developers for help on how to work around this behaviour; only they have the appropriate knowledge to solve this problem.\nXee's developers do appear to be aware of the issue:\n\n(Note that the App Store version is sandboxed, while the non-App Store trial and full versions are not sandboxed. If you prefer the safety of the OS X sandbox, you should get the App Store version. However, the sandboxed version needs to ask you for permission for certain operations, and if you find this annoying, you should get the non-App Store version.)\n\nTell Apple\nConsider providing feedback to Apple about this limitation and how it limits your workflow. Customer feedback will help shape what Mac App Store apps can and can not do in the future. For now, apps bought through the Apple Mac App Store are limited.\n\nA: Try copying the app contents to your hard drive and open from there. Maybe the app is protecting their files from itself.\n", "Q: Shortcut key to send new Messages.app text I was wondering if there is a way to have a system wide shortcut key to display Messages.app with the \"New Message\" window open so that I can quickly send messages.\nSomething like the little popup in Notifications sidebar would be perfect!

However, I realized that I can't connect my new 2013 macbook to it because the latter does not have a firewire port (is there another way)\n\n*I also tried disconnecting everything, including the keyboard and mouse (I have bt keyboard and a usb one so I tried both, plus mouse and trackpad, tried both)\n\n*I tried reseting the PRAM and that other reset (where you unplug for 15s)\n\n*Finally I scrounged out my old installation disk (Leopard) and booted Installation disk 1.\nWhen it came up, I went to Utilities in the menu and selected Disk Utility.\n\n\nSo far so good, but Disk Utility does not show my internal HDD, so I can't verify or repair it.\nIt does show my time machine drive connected by firewire, and of course it shows the DVD installation disk.\nWhat do I try next?\nGiven this happened the way it did if there is disk corruption I think it should be minor and reparable. But right now I don't even know if I'd be able to restore a new OS.\n\nA: Sorry Rhubarb but the next step is to physically remove the hard drive from the iMac. If you are not comfortable then the best option is to go to an Apple Store or Authorized repair center and let them do it for you.\nThey might even be able to test the iMac, hard drive cable, and the hard drive for you. Best case the cable just crapped out. Worst case the drive is dead and recovery is not possible. There are dozens of things in between both of those but more can be said concretely once the drive has been removed and tested in another enclosure.\n", "Q: Making a bootable USB Drive from an .iso I have a copy of the Windows XP install disk on my computer in the form of an .iso. I'm trying to install it to a partition using a bootable USB. I need to be able to make a bootable USB under Lion. How would I do this?\nThe USB is 4GB\nEDIT: Got my VM working and I'm using a windows utility to make my USB drive bootable. I'll see how it works and post here when I'm done.\nAlso forgot to mention, according to Apple's Website my mac can handle XP. They just don't provide the software with lion to do so.\nEDIT 2: Managed to get started, but not enough. Using my Windows XP VM and a program called \"rufus\" I made a bootable USB. Then using rEFIt I booted it up. But I got the following screen:\n\n\nA: The simple process is to use Apple's Bootcanp to handle three problems you face in booting from windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partitioning your internal drive (you can skip this - it's what Bootcanp wants, but purely optional)\n\n*Supply drivers - XP almost certainly won't have correct drivers for new Macs. Since you didn't mention your hardware, it might be old enough to not matter. \n\n*Ensure the Mac EFI sees and initiates boot - this is where making a bootable USB trips up most users. \n\n\nYou'll want to look at a tool like rEFIt, rEFInd or bootrunner since just burning the image onto USB is not enough to boot foreign OS like an XP live CD image. \nIf that image doesn't include an EFI aware boot loader, you'll need to modify that ISO and wrap it in a boot loader such as GRUB. \n\nA: The problem with creating a bootable thumb drive from an XP installer ISO is that it is not officially supported by Microsoft. There are however lots of places out there with utilities that will take the XP (or other) ISO files and put it on a thumb drive and make it a bootable installer. Like this, for example\nhttp://reboot.pro/topic/4900-install-xp-from-usb/\nThe problem then becomes that pretty much ALL of these utilities require Windows to create the bootable flash drive from the ISO. So there you have a chicken and egg problem. If you don't have a friend with a PC you could install XP in (the freeware) Virtualbox and use that to run your USB creation utility.\nThen comes the hard part. Finding the XP Bootcamp drivers. This thread talks about that at some length.\nHow to download Bootcamp drivers without Bootcamp assistant?\nApple also has a page with Bootcamp downloads. How well this will work with the ISO you have is unknown to me. I DO know that later versions of  Bootcamp will make a bootable thumbdrive with Windows on it and the Apple drivers included. I installed Windows 7 on a MacBook Air for one of the bosses at work just that way. Not sure if the earlier version will also do the same. Perhaps someone with experience installing XP this way knows.

My workaround is to simply disable automatic wakeups — and even automatic sleep. Since for me the problem only happens when leaving my computer plugged in and idle for a long time, I can disable automatic sleep only when the power adapter is connected, without reducing autonomy.\nHowever, this will increase power consumption and reduce idle time — so you might \nTo apply this workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences -> Energy Saver -> Power Adapter tab.\n\n*check the box \"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\"\n\n*uncheck the boxes \"Wake for network access\" and \"Enable Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter\" (I also have disabled Power Nap disabled when on battery, in the Battery tab, but I'm not sure this was required).\n\n\n*Therefore, some users only reproduce the problem when certain peripherals are plugged in.  But for one user it might be Bluetooth, for another one some USB hard disk, and so on — there's no easy to recognize pattern, which might mean the problem is due to whatever driver happens to have an apparently rather common driver bug.\nUpdate: my laptop is a Retina MBP Late 2013, and I am not sure how much this generalizes to other laptop (see comments).\n\nA: Check with pmset -g for the hibernatemode setting.

I haven't turned it on in a long time but last time I did, it worked fine. So more than 20 years later that SE/30 works just fine.\n\"For how many years can I expect to use an iPad 1\" depends COMPLETELY on how you plan on using it and what your needs will be 2 to 10 or 20 years down the road.\nIf you can download and use all the apps you need NOW without ever upgrading them or the O/S then you can use it till the hardware gives out. If all you need is a simple web browser, mail program, etc. The same applies.\nIf, however, you need to keep up with technology. If you need to have the latest and greatest apps and operating system if you need to be compatible with all the NEW stuff out there, perhaps an original iPad would not be a great investment. Save up your dollars and buy a newer one.\nThe wife and I bought an iPad 2 in May of last year for a specific purpose: POS for our small business (square) and streaming music plus some casual web browsing. there is no reason why it won't still be able to do that 2, 5 or even more years in the future as it doesn't NEED to have the latest and greatest to do the job it is currently doing.\nIf that is the case with you, buy the old iPad and be satisfied with what you have.\n\nA: The iPad 1 is now on iOS 5.1.1. That means it's now two major iOS versions behind. \nI think your worries are very valid. Some very popular applications (e.g. Spotify) are already no longer available for iOS 5.\nUnless you can accept the loss within a year I would not buy it. If you think you can stomach the loss, it can be a nice toy for the kids maybe?\n", "Q: How to set my iPhone was always seen in iTunes via wi-fi? My iPhone cable is a bit broken and I often use wi-fi connection of my iPhone5 and iTunes. Sometimes my iPhone is not seen in iTunes. How to set my iPhone was always seen in iTunes via wi-fi?\n\nA: I used to run into this problem all the time, and it was very frustrating.  The only thing that made any difference was to edit the settings of my wifi router to assign both my computer and the iPhone permanent, static IP addresses on my home network.  My iPad still occasionally disappears from iTunes, but this has cut down the frequency of the problem by about 85%.\nI assume that this happens because iTunes caches the mobile devices location on the network, but doesn't update it very frequently.  Then if the device shows up with a new IP, it chokes.\n", "Q: How to change OSX System (Default) Shortcuts? In OSX (now is Mavericks), how to change the System Default Shortcuts, for example which are currently like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command + Shift + Q .. for current User Logout.\n\n*Command + Q .. for current (active) Application Quit.\n\n*Command + Down Arrow .. for Opening A File.\n\n\nBlah blah .. I don't like any of those, honestly.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to permanently change them, please?\n\n\n(I would even PAY for an App if it the only way to do.)\nThanks!\n\nA: This is pretty easy. I already answered a similar question for someone who wanted to redefine Command-V here.\nBasically you need to go into System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and define a new shortcut under \"All Apps\". If you don't want to change it to something useful you will have to define a shortcut you will never use such as Shift-Command-Option-1.\nIf you want to get rid of all the shortcuts then I suggest 'Karabiner-Elements' and spend some time understanding how to write a private.xml config file for it. You might also want to grab a copy of 'Key Codes' so you can figure out which keys push out which keycodes and modifiers.\nIt's certainly possible to map the \"Log Out …\" as Shift-Command-Q out of the way. You just enter it into Shortcuts with the name and the ellipsis and the shortcut no longer works. Command-Q is impossible with the shortcut method but it was the only one I could find.\n(I also wouldn't be rude and peremptory to people who were trying to help me but that could just be me.)\n\nA: Go into System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, select Accessibility on left Pane and check \"Invert colors\" shortcut. Initially it's disabled. \nModify it to command+Q so from now this shortcut will not close anymore apps, it will just invert colors. It's an easy way to get rid of the habit to hit command+Q. \n", "Q: Why does thunderbolt to displayport cable result in video with color bleeding? I have an ASUS VE278 display, which is cable of handling VGA, DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI. I have an early 2013 model Macbook Pro, with two Thunderbolt ports, and an HDMI port. If I use the HDMI port (going through an HDMI to DVI converter cable), my ASUS display looks great, just like it did on my PC. No issues. However, if I use a \"thunderbolt to displayport\" adapter cable (such as this one) I get color bleeding artifacts on my screen, around contrasting colors, etc.\nIf I take a screen shot, everything looks fine on the screen shot (when viewed on another monitor or the Macbook's native display).\nHere's a photo of the artifacting, while looking at this artifact test png image :\n(it's hard to capture on camera, so forgive me):\n\nDoes driving a display via ThunderBolt always result in this color bleeding? I am ordering a thunderbolt to HDMI cable.. to see if that makes a difference. But what the heck is going on here?\n\nA: Wow. So. Apparently OSX is treating my display as if it were a TV, and is only sending YCbCr color space instead of full RGB color space.\nFound this article by Robert Pill that indicates the problem, and how to fix it:\nHow to force RGB in Mac OS X\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the patch-edid.rb script from the forums thread above and\nput it in your home directory.\n\n*Connect only the external monitor(s) in question (I closed my MacBook\nlid, for example). The script will make override files for any\nconnected monitor. Type “ruby patch-edid.rb” in Terminal.\n\n*A new folder will be created in your home directory. Move it into the\n“/System/Library/Displays/Overrides” folder. If Finder tells you that\nyou are overwriting an existing folder, consider backing it up first.\nRestart your computer, enjoy your monitor.\nTo undo the changes, either delete the folder you had copied to the\nOverrides folder (if it didn’t already exist) or replace it with the\nfolder you had backed up.\nAlso, one of his commenters made an improved script, available here.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s: Which consumes more battery, 4G, or 4G LTE? Under Settings > Cellular, there's an option to enable/disable LTE. When disabled, my phone reverts to 4G, as indicated by the icon in the status bar.\nI've read elsewhere that using 3G causes greater battery drain than 4G (in fact, Apple's own iPhone 5s spec sheet indicates that you only get 8 hours of 3G data, versus 10 hours of 4G LTE data). Which leads me to the following line of thought...\nIf I disable LTE and revert to standard 4G, what is the effect on battery life?\n\nA: \"Standard 4G\" is kind of a meaningless phrase.  According to this article, disabling \"LTE\" means it's limited to either CDMA 3G or HSPA+.  HSPA+ is supposed to have performance comparable to LTE, so I would guess that if you disable LTE and see a \"4G\" icon, it means you're getting HSPA+.\nPC Mag confirms that Apple (like their competitors and partners) started using \"4G\" to refer to any post-3G network, like LTE, WiMAX, and HSPA+.\nAnyway, most of the articles I've found comparing power usage between HSPA+ and LTE suggest that LTE has slightly lower power consumption, but it seems to be a pretty small difference.  The signal strength where you are located probably has more impact than this setting.  Early LTE phones apparently sucked a lot of power even when idle, but with newer phones this seems to have been improved, e.g., this iPhone 5 user claims battery life is \"nearly identical\" whether LTE is enabled or not.\nSo you can try both settings and see which works better for you, but I wouldn't expect a huge power savings.\n\nA: I have discovered that disabling LTE on my iPhone allows my phone to receive a much stronger signal (4 bars vs 1) in most parts of Manhattan. But once in a while, LTE works inside a building where 4G doesn't. \n", "Q: Macbook Air Logitech K120 USB Keyboard auto remapping problem I'm having an issue with my 2013 MacBook Air.

If you really want to back up iPhone as much as iPhone data without iTunes/iCloud there are paid/free third-party methods to do so. \n", "Q: What do I do when I get a \"sync session failed to start\" message when syncing iPhone to itunes? The context is that I'm restoring my wife's new replacement iPhone from a backup. It already did the first sync, where it gets all the settings and whatnot, but not the apps.  Tried the second sync, where it normally transfers the apps, but I'm getting the error message.  \n\nA: On your iPhone, force close all the Apps in the multitask window. Depending on your version of iOS, you do the following:\nOn iOS 7 and before:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Home screen, click the Home button twice. \n\n*Tap and hold on the app. \n\n*When it starts to jiggle, tap the X to close it.\n\n*Repeat until all the apps have been closed.\n\n\nOn iOS 8:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Home screen, click the Home button twice. \n\n*Swipe the application preview window upwards to close the app. (you can close multiple apps at once)\n\n*Repeat until all the apps have been closed.\n\n\nNow do a Soft reset of your iPhone:\nHold both Home and Sleep button for around 10secs until you see the Apple logo then release. After it returns to Home screen, connect to sync and see if this resolves the issue.\nSource: https://discussions.apple.com/message/18381241#18381241\n\nA: On my Mac with macOS Big Sur 10.6 and my iPhone 12 with iOS 14.8, I needed to restart my iPhone to resolve this.

The backup process runs at the standard once per hour. This often slows down my machine while I'm trying to work on it. Understanding that it will provide less protection, is it possible to adjust Time Machine to backup at a different interval (e.g. once per day) instead of once per hour without installing third-party software?\n\nA: No.  Given that there are several third-party utilities that provide this functionality (and nothing else), like TimeMachineEditor, it seems highly unlikely that there's a built-in way to do it.\n\nA: or like this http://www.klieme.com/TimeMachineScheduler.html\nworks nice for me under Mavericks, ML and Lion\n\nA: for once a day I just do it manually, with the Time Machine turned off in the System preferences.\n", "Q: Safari list of closed sessions feature I don't use Safari that often but I remember this really nice feature where you could scroll through a list of previously closed sessions. I think it was located on the \"Top Sites\" page that Safari features. Now I can't find it, so I'm guessing either it was erased in an update or moved somewhere. Is there a way to access this list of closed sessions? \n\nA: It is still there and it looks like this\n\nUnder the History Tab - Show Top Sites\nin my Safari 6.0.5\n", "Q: iOS 7 Phone app interface doesn't show \"Decline\" button when it's asleep In iOS 7, when the phone is in Sleep mode and I receive a call, I don't see the \"Decline\" button. All I see is a green \"Answer...\" button that requires me to slide to the right to answer the call. Is there anyway we can change that? I know that there are buttons for \"Remind Me Later, etc\" but I want the \"Decline\" button. \nIt works fine when the phone is not in Sleep mode. \n\nA: Simple press the power button once to decline the call. Notification center will keep a reminder for you about the missed call.\nEDIT: Pressing the power button once registers as an ignore. Pressing it twice will drop the call to voicemail.\n", "Q: Opera dmg corrupt I have been trying to download the Opera DMG from my Mac OSX on a very slow internet.\nEverytime, the download starts, reaches a little above 1 MB, and then shows as download complete. When I try opening the DMG, it says that it is not recognized.\nDownloads work fine on all other sites except Opera.\nAny idea what could be wrong ?\n\nA: I believe the download is timing out. The Opera mirrors you are downloading from might be suffering issues or it might be your ISP's connection which you pay for. You might need to wait a while so that the issues on Opera's side (if it is their side) gets fixed or you may want to look for an alternate place to download the DMG.\n\nA: As James points out the download is timing out.\nFor the current version of Opera you should be downloading a file that is at least 55.7 Mb large.\n\n", "Q: How to calculate max with condition in Numbers? How can I calculate max with condition in Numbers?\nIn other words, I want something like maxifs, which operates max operation instead of sum operation for sumifs.\n\nA: Numbers version 3 on Mac and the equivalent web app/ios app do not have that level of abstraction, but on a Mac, Numbers is fairly scriptable in powerful ways.\nI would probably dump the data into a SQLite database if your comment means you are familiar with that. This is documented at the wonderful OS X Automation site.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://iworkautomation.com/numbers/sqlite-make.html\nYou could also program the logic you wanted in Applescript or possible the new javascript bridge for AppleScript on later OS X versions. Here is an example of complicated logic used to format cells. You could likely adapt that to process the data and then write the results to a new table.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://iworkautomation.com/numbers/examples-highlight-intersection.html\nIt's not the same, but it would let you use numbers and not Excel for Mac.\n\nA: Mac Numbers does now have a MAXIFS function. But, it depends on exactly what you want to do with it. If you could edit your question to add an example, I could expand this answer to address how to use MAXIFS in Numbers for that example.\nI use it in a column where vertically there are two types of data: a number for order from 1 to 4 and an associated mass which is greater than 40, so:\nMAXIFS(Col Range for max, Col Range for test 1, test 1, Col Range for test 2, test 2, ... more tests as required)\n\nAll columns have to be the same length. It takes the maximum value in the subset of the max range of all those values horizontally next to the values in the test ranges that pass their tests.\nHowever, if want a passive value, ie, not one that is maximised, such as a date, that is associated with the maxes calculated in the test ranges, you have to use maxifs to find the maximum value and then use that as an argument to XLOOKUP.\n", "Q: OS X Server Postfix configuration I hope this is the right site to ask this question. I have successfully configured OS X server (3.0.2 on mavericks) mail service, but if i edit my /Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix/main.cf (postfix config file), it won't affect the behaviour of the server mail service.\nFor example I changed smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks permit_sasl_authenticated to smtpd_client_restrictions = reject and the same with smtpd_recipient_restrictions, but i'm still able to login to the SMTP Server and send emails.\nI always did sudo postfix reload and sudo serveradmin stop mail, sudo serveradmin start mail.\nWhat am i doing wrong?\n\nA: To check which file your postfix is using do a ps ax | grep master at the command line and you should see a line with\nmaster -c /Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix\n\nwhich tells you that it is indeed using the files in that directory.\nIf it is using those files then I'd try logging in from another machine using telnet and see what is says.\ntelnet mailserver.example.com 25\n\nIf you want to try sending a message \"by hand\" then check out http://www.smtp2go.com/articles/smtp-protocol for some good notes on SMTP.\nIt is here that Postfix will probably reject your email. If it does reject your email then set smtpd_client_restrictions back to the default and see if it then allows your email through.\n", "Q: What is the proper way to use the cut command on ps command output This question is related to a question I posted on rogue firefox procesess. It relates to firefox processes following image uploads that I have been having for a while.\nI am trying to get to the second field of the ps command with the following set of pipes, so that I can kill the processes from the command line quickly:\nps aux| grep fire|cut -f 2\n\nHowever this produces the wrong output as it shows the whole line of ps.\nI know that the default delimiter for cut is tab\nI have also tried:\nps aux| grep fire|cut -f 2 -d \\t\n\n\nFrom this question on stackoverflow I know that \nps axu | grep '[f]irefox' | awk '{print $2}'\n\ngives me the output I want.\n\nI want to understand why my two versions of cut are not working, and can it be made to work piping ps to grep and then to cut and getting to the second column (ie. the process IDs).\n\nA: ps does not use Tabs to separate column (run ps aux > foo; vi foo to verify). As an alternative you can cut on character level by running\nkill $(ps aux | grep fire | cut -c 17-23)\n\nOr you can also just run\npkill fire\n\n(or pgrep fire to see which processes would match)\n", "Q: Rip CD to FLAC on Mavericks I have a large collection of Audio CDs I would like to convert to audio files.

I believe my iMac is having graphics issues but I have an external monitor I would like to use to view my iMac. Is it possible to configure the settings for my iMac from my MacBook Pro so that I can set my iMac to display via the external monitor and if not are there any alternatives?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: This sounds like either a graphics card failure or a logic board failure: I would recommend getting the data off that drive ASAP and look at getting that machine diagnosed and repaired.\n\nA: If you have at least remote logins enabled, you can use the answer to this question to enable Screen Sharing and accessing your iMac from the MacBookPro.\nIf you already have Screen Sharing enabled, you can use this directly to access your iMac.\n", "Q: Built in FTP client (cmd + k) - can't upload files (Mavericks) I have just found out that I can enter a built-in FTP client on my Mac by simply pressing ^ Ctrl + K.

When I run xcode-select --install  from the terminal, the command fails with an error message Can't install software because it is not currently available from the Software Update Server (see second linked post for screenshot).\nIt was suggested by many to simply download the command line tools package from the developer website, which I have done (already had an account). My question, is the second procedure strictly equivalent to running xcode-select --install? I have suspicions that the paths to the different libraries and headers are not defined in the same way when downloading and executing the dmg. \nI am running particle physics software called root and compiling with the available C++ interpreter fails with \"Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64\" error, probably due to the use of standard libc++ instead of libstdc++. Strangely enough this problem does not appear on another computer (running same OSX 10.9) where I was able to run the xcode-select --install command.\nIs there any way to solve this error message when running xcode-select --install? People have suggested this could be due to the fact that command line tools are already installed but I have both tried deleting command line tools by hand (sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools) and even a clean install of Mavericks but no luck.\n\nA: Are you sure they are installing the same version?\nAt the command line on both machines run cc -v - the latest version seems to be Apple LLVM version 5.0 (clang-500.2.79) (based on LLVM 3.3svn).\n\nA: Also, try running\nexport\n\nto see what environment variables you have set; it's likely that the development tools are prefixed somewhere you don't have a path, so the shell can't find them.\n", "Q: Mac USB Linux boot disk I have a 13\" MacBook Pro early 2011 model.

I'm unable to kill a process using any of the techniques I'm aware of (\"Force Quit\" in Activity Monitor, top, killall from the Terminal) and wonder if there are some additional steps I can take.\n\n~ $ sudo killall -KILL 77439\nPassword:\nNo matching processes were found\n~ $ killall -KILL 77439\nNo matching processes belonging to you were found\n~ $ killall 77439\nNo matching processes belonging to you were found\n~ $ killall Mathematica\nNo matching processes belonging to you were found\n\nFWIW the process is \"Mathematica\" which I cannot relaunch, Quit, or Force Quit, or sample, either by name or PID, and it appears to have some odd side effects (screenshots don't appear, can't empty trash, and can't even shut down the system).\nAre there additional steps that can be taken to really really kill a badly behaved process?\n\nA: killall kills by process name (which is definitively not 77439 and most probably also not Mathematica). You can use kill 77439 or (if this fails) kill -9 77439 instead (but if the process is really stuck, only a reboot will solve the problem).\nAlso, due the the way sending/processing of signals (like kill -9) works in Unix/OS X, there are situations where a process will be unkillable. One typical example for this is if a process gets stuck while accessing some external device and never actually gets control back. In such situations a reboot is the only way to get rid of the process.\n\nA: Sometimes killing the parental process can get rid of an otherwise unkillable process.

It seems to be reasonably recent, OSX 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion), 8gb Ram, 128GB SSD.  If I use a VM, do I still need to boot in OSX, and essentially have Linux running in \"another window\"? Do I loose out on anything hardware wise, or can I still access everything as I could from Linux?\nOr would I be better with a normal install (this looks to be difficult from teh searching I have done so far). Assuming I partition the disk, will I be able to read / write both partitions from Linux easily?\nI will likely use the machine for the usual websurfing, plus a bit of python development. Nothing heavy, and number crunching.\nAny recomended tutorials to expalin how to do it along with your answer would be greatly apreciated.\n\nA: VM\nRunning in a VM would be the easiest way to go. There are a number of virtualisation apps available on OS X, but I recommend Parallels Desktop. This lets you use OS X and Linux at the same time, but it means that you sacrifice some performance in the VM.\nVMs are very simple — select the ISO as the install media, and let Parallels Desktop's automatic install do the rest.\nDual-boot\nAlternatively, you can dual-boot using Boot Camp. Begin the Boot Camp process as normal for Windows, but when you reboot after the partition has been created, simply insert your Linux media instead of Windows install media.\n\nA: Just one problem here is that if you create a dual boot system then the Linux side will not be able to read or write to the Mac partition and the Mac will not be able to write to the Linux partition though it would be able to read if you install OSXFuse and ext2Fuse (read support is there but is unreliable and not really a good idea for production systems).\n\nA: The best way is to do a dual boot Mac OS X El Capitan / Linux.\nYou could read and write Mac OS X partition with ExtFS for Mac OS X 9 to OS X 10.11.\n", "Q: Can I use two wireless keyboards with my iMac? We were hoping that our iMac would accept two wireless Bluetooth keyboards of the exact same model to be used at the same time. (Lego 2 player, in case you're wondering)\nHowever, I can't seem to pair the second. I thought as long as we used different keys to control each player, we'd be fine.\nAnyone have any idea?\n\nA: You can connect a wired and wireless keyboard at the same time.\nI don't have a way to test two wireless right now, but how are you doing it?  Just turning on the second keyboard won't work. Your iMac won't bother because one is already connected. Have you tried connecting manually? In the Bluetooth preferences you can manually connect to other devices. Of course both keyboards have to be paired first. If you have the Bluetooth menu turned on in the preferences, you can try connecting from there as well. \n\nA: Multiple keyboards is no problem.  If using wireless, specifically Apple bluetooth, then once one has been connected, it won't ever bother trying to connect to another one unless you force it.  2 ways of doing this:\n1) Turn off your old keyboard, then turn on your new one, and pair it up\n2) Manually add another keyboard in system preferences - methods vary depending on OS level\nOnce you have done this, then so long as both are turned on, then both will be be available to use.\nThe only provisos are that any keyboard bindings or setup etc will apply to both, you cannot use different settings per keyboard - they will function identically - you will need to ensure that you use different keys if you wish for 2 people to play a game using a keyboard each, or you will end up both controlling the same character.  I have no idea what happens when you put caps lock on, it may or may not work on both inputs, or may be specific to the keyboard you used it on - be wary of odd things like that where perhaps a keyboard not showing caps lock is using it etc.\nAlso, within system preferences you may not be able to identify which keyboard is which, and things like battery level indicators etc will apply to the keyboard which connected first, not to both, and you won't know which this is.  To get round this, enable the Bluetooth menu bar icon and you can view settings directly per device from the menu bar\n\nA: Sorry but OS X just let you connect one external keyboard at a time, maybe you can manage this by using a special separate Application. But i don't know if such an App already exists - try to google it.\nor perhaps this works for you use a macbook with its internal keyboard and screen for one person and an extra monitor and a wireless keyboard for the 2nd person.\n", "Q: Should I upgrade an old MacBook (2,1) to Mavericks?

Then put your old one into a USB-case and you have extra storage for almost no extra money.\n\nA: Lion works just fine on my 13inch white MacBook2,1 mid-2007. I'm thinking about a RAM upgrade, I got 2GB, will be upgrading to 6GB (yes, it's possible) and I'll replace my HD to an SSD.

As for what will help, turn off location services and turn down screen brightness are good starts. Good luck!\n", "Q: Seemingly random apps have a slash through their icons My Mac hung overnight and was in a bad enough place that I had to power cycle it this morning. When it came back up, I logged in and found that a number of the apps in my dock had a slash through their icons. When I tried to launch them, a dialog came up informing me that they could not be run on my Mac.\nI logged in as a different user, and these same apps worked fine. I also tried deleting and reinstalling some of them, and those apps were fine thereafter. However, some of the affected apps are stock applications that come with the OS (e.g. Terminal.app), so that's not a great solution.\nLaunching the apps from the command line works fine. I also found that zipping up the app package, deleting the original, and unzipping the copy seemed to get things working again.\nMy suspicion is that the Finder or another component has cached information about these apps, and that the cache has been corrupted. This would explain why things are fine for other users on the system. However, I don't know where that information might be stored. I've tried deleting the Finder preferences and the entire contents of ~/Library/Application Support/Caches to no avail.\nIs there an easy way to get my account back to a good state, or am I stuck with manually fixing each app one at a time?\nUpdate: Further testing has revealed that zipping and unzipping affected applications is not 100% reliable.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  Furthermore, sometimes merely moving/renaming an application is sufficient to get it back to normal, but sometimes that has no effect, either.  This only makes me more interested in finding a real solution.\n\nA: If it is a cache problem then I would suggest running AppleJack to clear caches and fix permissions.\nIt's a wonder of a tool. It would be my first step.\n\nA: I wasn't able to find a satisfactory, automated solution.  I did, however, find something that worked for individual apps.\nSince each of the affected applications were Apple-provided apps, trying to drag them to the trash produced a message indicating that they were required by the system, and could not be removed.  Somehow, this action reversed whatever was causing the application to be flagged as un-usable, and things started working again.  So I simply tried to delete each application one at a time; I don't know if dragging them as a group would have worked.\nI still don't know exactly what caused this, other than the fact that the system was in a really strange place overnight.  I'm going to run a backup, cross my fingers and hope it doesn't happen again.\n", "Q: What repair options exist for iPhone 5s I bought an iPhone 5s about 3 days ago. Unfortunately I've discovered that the headphone jack is broken.\nThe left side of my headphones doesn't produce sound. I tried the headphones in another device and they worked fine. So the problem lies with the iPhone 5s.\nWhen I took it back to the store, I was told it would take 2 weeks to get it fixed because they had to send it away for repair.\nWhat options do I have to get it fixed?\n\nA: If you bought the phone from an official Apple retailer, and it is new and within the warranty period, then there should be no issues with returning the phone for a refund or replacement.\nThe sales policies of Apple are at http://www.apple.com/legal/ and http://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/sales-policies/retail.html\nWhat complicates matters in many cases is the carrier. Unless you purchased an unsubsidized phone, you may have the carrier balk at a return and have to wait for them to clear your subsidy.\nIn the meantime, the issues sounds like the phone connector jack internal to the phone, you could attempt a DIY repair by inserting the headphone connector and giving it a good wiggle and spin about in the socket, this could get it working. If not, then read up on the policies and see if the store is willing to work with you to find a solution.\n", "Q: Ergonomic Mac keyboards I could really use a good ergonomic keyboard for my iMac to try to deal with some wrist issues. The reviews of the Kinesis Freestyle 2 seem basically OK, but there are some complaints about oddly placed keys and the way the function key works, neither of which really appeals to me.\nDoes anyone out there have this keyboard? Any comments on this or any other issue? Also, are there other ergo keyboards I should be looking at? (The Kinesis Advantage doesn't really appeal to me, with the placement of common keys in the middle).\n\nA: As someone who many years ago suffered from a severe case of RSI I suggest that if you are having a problem that you take every ergonomic keyboard out there and throw them into the nearest lake or river. Ergonomic keyboards look good but tend to fix nothing.\nAlmost all problems causing pain can be fixed by altering your seating, arm position, keyboard location and typing practice.\nYour first step should be to find a good specialist centre that can analyse all of these things and do such steps as wire up your muscles and see which ones are straining when you type and then retrain you. If you need such things as wrist supports or angled keyboards they will tell you so and almost certainly advise on which ones would best suit you. If they don't then they are not the best place for you and find somewhere else.\nIf you are having problems see a good specialist centre now, do not wait, do not think that anything you do will fix the problem or that it will go away.\nI did not take this advice and ended up spending three months unable to touch a keyboard.\n", "Q: Bluetooth Magic Mouse disconnects I have an iMac, now running Mountain Lion; about six months ago I started finding that the mouse would lose connectivity whenever I banged it, even lightly, on the mouse pad; I also got a couple of kernel panics while the mouse was disconnected.

They upgraded me from Lion to Mountain Lion and said the mouse looked OK. Things were fine for a while, but now the mouse is failing again.\nI have no way of knowing whether the mouse is hosed, the bluetooth connection sucks, or there's a hardware problem in my box.

For example, I can see the carrier name moving and merging with the carrier name on the regular home screen. Is this normal behavior, and does anyone know how to fix this? I close apps all the time, so I find this a little annoying.\n\nA: The \"blur\" would be considered \"Normal\" behavior!\nThe \"blur\" is used as an optical indication of application switching (and it is for your information). \nThe operating system would not need it, but the designers have decided to use it as information.\nChanging that would require knowledge of operating system programing, and it is not recommended for general public users.\n", "Q: How can I use Keyboard Maestro to select all content in an Excel cell?

This is very annoying when switching between tabs that are at the end.\nIs it possible to make them scrollable as it is done in Firefox?\n\nA: If you are running the latest version of Safari, you can pinch in on a trackpad to reveal all of your tabs. You can swipe through this list using two fingers or by clicking on the dots below the previews.\n\n\nA: I would probably wait until Yosimite ships. During the WWDC Safari demo one of the things shown was how you could scroll \"quickly\" through a large amount of tabs. I usually prefer native solution than add-ons anyway.\n\nA: Take a look at the answer to this similar question. It suggests using Glims which, whilst it won't allow you to scroll tabs, it does allow you to set the minimum tab size to the favicon size, which allows you to have many more tabs open at once without the grouping behaviour.\n\nA: Apple announced that this will be a future feature in Safari when Yosemite ships.

Is there a good chance it's the sata cable that needs to be replaced?\n\nA: Try an erase and install, instead of just reinstalling OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your files and boot into an external install media (not the Recovery HD).\n\n*Open Disk Utility, select the internal disk and repartition it to 1 partition.\n\n*Install OS X normally, then restore your files.\n\n\nA: Flashing folder with question mark means that your mac can not find OS to boot. It's either it can not find some files needed in the early stages of boot up process, or can't find boot volume, or can't find the hard drive.\nBefore destroying all your data try reassigning your boot partition in Startup Disk preferences.\nIf that doesn't help check your cables. You simply might have not plugged them in firmly enough or there might be some dust in there that prevents good connection.\nCheck an article on the Apple KB for more options: A flashing question mark appears when you start your Mac.\n\nA: First, you need to isolate the problem. Put the internal hardrive in a casing and connect it to your laptop through USB. Then boot up the OS X in this configuration by holding down OPTION key. If everything is smooth after a couple of hours, the problem is definitely SATA cable.\nI have a 2011 13' MBP (A1278) and the cable broke a year ago. From what I read, the cable from this year (Parts No. 821-1226-A) is particularly faulty. You can replace it with the next iteration (821-1480-A).

When extglob is enabled, @(srt|ass|ssa) matches exactly one out of srt, ass, and ssa. Bash doesn't perform word splitting or filename expansion inside [[, so $f doesn't have to be quoted. printf %s\\\\n prints each argument on a separate line. ${f##*/} removes the longest */ pattern from the start, ${base%???} removes the last three characters, ${target%.*} removes the shortest .* pattern from the end, and ${base: -3} expands to the last three characters.

I can't even remove the accounts completely, that fails in the same way.\nIt's an iPhone 5S running iOS 7.0.5. I'm syncing three calendars. Two Exchange accounts from different servers and one Gmail.\nThis problem happened to me once before and then I ended up doing a Factory Reset. I'd rather not do that again.\nPower assertion\ntimeout:https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26840/iOS_power_assertion_timeout_DataAccess_Exchange_related.png\nand with https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26840/iOS_power_assertion_timeout_fetchMobileSynchronously.png\nMobileCal: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26840/iOS_MobileCal_has_active_assertions_beyond_parmitted_time.png\nThe preferences timeout:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26840/iOS_preferences_timeout_turning_off_calendar_sync.png\nI would love to find a solution to this! It could be to the root of the problem, how to force calendar sync off, how to force removal of email accounts, or to something that I've missed.\n\nA: I logged in to the webmail (OWA) and there Options -> See All Options -> Phone\nTwo devices were listed, my old phone and the current. I removed both. Then I restarted the phone and the sync seems to be back in order. The phone hasn't run hot for several hours and both mail and calendar events works fine.\nPS. Before this I had also Reset Network Settings. I have no idea if this was part of the solution. DS.\n", "Q: Why Find my iPhone application is built in such useless way? Today I lost my iPhone 3GS And I was trying to locate it using \"Find My iPhone\" app. But as we know, it rarely helps!  \nI was wondering why is it built in this way and why they didn't use a MAC address based search instead, so that even if someone removes your account and formats everything still  you can find it whenever the Phone connects to the internet using the unique MAC address.\nI know this doesn't help me find my iPhone but at least it could give some ideas for future versions of this type of applications.\n\nEDIT\nAnd furthermore, why they don't add this function to the iOS core instead of running it as an app which can easily be disabled.\n\nA: Apple realized they could make Find My iPhone work better and between hardware that supports iOS 7 and the new OS - activation lock does precisely what I think you ask. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/TI174\nThe tracking doesn't require any app to be installed for iOS 7 or earlier OS and is baked into the settings app. The app only assists you in tracking from a remote device if you don't want to use the iCloud web interface for tracking and wiping. \n", "Q: Tethering iPhone I have an iPhone 5s, and a wireless plan that permits tethering. I am wondering if there are any consequences of frequent tethering. For example, if my phone was plugged in to a charger and tethered for a couple of hours every day, would this lead to faster than normal \"wear and tear\" for the phone, since the activity is so heavy? Or is this a completely ordinary task?\n\nA: No, you can simply do this. Just be sure you have enough power to keep it running, as the battery will drain fast on tethering. But since you mention it being plugged in a charger - go for it.\n", "Q: What is a user friendly ebook converter for pc to Nook HD+? I've tried using calibre, but it cuts out or messes with the original text from the pdf. I don't want to just give up and read from my computer, so any ideas? (please posts links if any.)\n\nA: Calibre is without a doubt the best ebook library converter/manager I've ever used.  Free and crossplatform for Mac, Linux, and Windows.\n", "Q: Emacs key bindings on other programs I am a heavy Emacs user and would love to have some of my Emacs keyboard bindings when editing text on other apps.\nI understand I could program these macros with Keyboard Maestro manually, but I was surprised I could not find any pre-defined macros for this. Before I reinvent the wheel, are there any repositories of keyboard maestro macros out there? Does Keyboard Maestro come with any set of macros that facilitate this process? \n\nA: Keyboard Maestro macros often have noticeable delays and it's not really the best method for keyboard remapping.\nYou could create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict instead:\n{\n  \"~b\" = moveWordBackward:;\n  \"~f\" = moveWordForward:;\n  \"~F\" = moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:;\n  \"~B\" = moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:;\n  \"~d\" = deleteWordForward:;\n  \"~u\" = (uppercaseWord:, moveForward:, moveForward:);\n  \"~l\" = (lowercaseWord:, moveForward:, moveForward:);\n  \"~c\" = (capitalizeWord:, moveForward:, moveForward:);\n  \"~v\" = pageUp:;\n  \"~V\" = pageUpAndModifySelection:;\n  \"^V\" = pageDownAndModifySelection:;\n  \"^ \" = setMark:;\n  \"^w\" = deleteToMark:;\n  \"~<\" = moveToBeginningOfDocument:;\n  \"~>\" = moveToEndOfDocument:;\n  \"~/\" = complete:;\n  \"^l\" = selectParagraph:;\n  \"~h\" = selectParagraph:;\n  \"^_\" = undo:;\n  \"^/\" = undo:;\n  \"^x\" = {\n    \"^x\" = swapWithMark:;\n    \"^m\" = selectToMark:;\n  };\n}\n\nDefaultKeyBinding.dict doesn't work in some applications like Xcode or Firefox. Key combinations that enter dead key states (like ⌥U in the U.S. keyboard layout) can't be reassigned. There are also methods like performClose: and openDocument:, but they don't work in all applications. See http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/KeyBindings/Emacs%20Esc%20Bindings.dict or http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/selectors.html.\nAnother option is to use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4Macbook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <not>{{EMACS_MODE_IGNORE_APPS}}</not>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::P, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::N, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::B, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::P, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, VK_SHIFT</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::N, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, VK_SHIFT</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::B, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, VK_SHIFT</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, VK_SHIFT</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::B, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, VK_OPTION</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, VK_OPTION</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::B, VK_OPTION | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, VK_OPTION | VK_SHIFT</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F, VK_OPTION | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, VK_OPTION | VK_SHIFT</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::D, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::FORWARD_DELETE, VK_OPTION</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::V, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::PAGEUP</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::V, VK_OPTION | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::PAGEUP, VK_SHIFT</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::V, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::PAGEDOWN, VK_SHIFT</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nThe key codes have to be changed for keyboard layouts like Dvorak or Colemak. EMACS_MODE_IGNORE_APPS includes terminal emulators, Emacs applications, and VMs, but you can also add custom appdef elements.\nThere is also a predefined Emacs mode group, but for example the setting for changing ⌥F to ⌥→ also changes ⌥⌘F to ⌥⌘→.\n", "Q: iMovie hard drive space I was using my macbook air 2013 to create a youtube video on iMovie. When I started I had 55gb of space left. I recorded everything used handbrake to convert it and edited it in iMovie. I then exported it and put it on youtube. I then deleted absolutely every file from iMovie and the event. But my remaining space had gone from 55gb to 44gb. What is taking up this space?\n\nA: Try looking at your cache. Navigate to ~/Library/Caches/ and look for a folder for iMovie (may also be labeled com.apple.iMovie). Check its size. If it's quite large, then you've found the culprit.\nNote: deleting the contents of Caches is safe provided the application isn't running. While not necessary, deleting the contents of the entire folder should prompt a reboot.\nYou may also elect to give Grand Perspective a try, which will show you the contents of your drive and how files are arranged on it. This will help hunt down the loss of space you are experiencing.\n\nA: iMovie now has a “Delete Render Files” button right inside its preferences window (opened via Cmd+,).\nYou should be able to just open your preferences and use that button to clear any unnecessary hard drive space. \nAside from that, after exporting your movie and backing up both the sources and final result somewhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the project from projects list\n\n*Remove the library section with the sources from the iMovie Library\nP.S. Here's another approach that explains the current location of cache files and how to delete them manually or with the command line: How to free up iMovie disk space\n\n\nA: It's probably still stored in a Time Machine local backup since local backups are automatically enabled for laptops.\nOpen Finder, browse to the original location of the files you deleted, then open Time Machine. Go back in time to find the files, then right-click them and delete the backup. This will return the space.\nAlternatively, it might be an error with the drive, which could be fixed using Disk Utility's Repair Disk from the Recovery HD (boot with ⌘R). This would fix errors such as \"Invalid volume free block count.\"\n", "Q: Select \"Sent Items\" on Outlook with Keyboard Maestro Is there any way to have Keyboard Maestro select \"Sent Items\" on an app like Microsoft Outlook upon pressing a hot key?\nI have tried with \"Select Menu\" and \"Press Button\" but none of these options seem to work.\n\nA: Selecting Intractable GUI Elements with Keyboard Maestro\nThis is one of the most useful aspects of Keyboard Maestro, the ability to manipulate a GUI which is not easily accessed by other scripting options. I'll explain how to use this routine to solve your question, but it can be used for just about anything else.\nThe recycable core of the method is a sequence of three actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find Image on Screen.\n\n*Use Variable in the to set the mouse location mode.\n\n*Move or Click Mouse relative to the current mouse location.\n\n\nOnce these three actions are dragged into your macro, you'll need to configure them slightly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a screenshot of the graphical element you would like to select using ⌘-⇧-4.\n\n*Drag the screenshot into the Find Image on Screen box.\n\n*Test it by hitting try with the Display box checked while the icon is on the screen.\n\n*Make sure the same Variable is both set by Find Image on Screen and used by Use Variable.\n\n*Adjust the → and ↓ distance so that the button is pressed, in case the image found is slightly larger than the hitbox.\n\n\nAnd there you have it. This little block of actions is completely modular, so try to think of other fun uses. Here's my final macro:\n\n", "Q: Discard email in Outlook 2011 Say I start a new email, and I decide to discard it. If I press Alt+W, a window prompts me with the following three options shown below:\n\nMost of the time I want to \"Discard Changes\", but OS X does not let me use TAB to change my selection.\nI have tried every key combination, but and the only thing that works is using the mouse to click on \"Discard Changes\".\nI  would like to use my keyboard to confirm that yes , I just want to discard my email. Any way to do this?\n\nA: To do this completely from the keyboard, go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts and enable Full Keyboard Access to All Controls, or press ⌃F7.\n\nYou can then ⇥ between the buttons, and space to select.\n↩︎ will always select the default button (in this case, Save).\n\n", "Q: My keyboard shortcut System Preference panel doesn't allow me to create application shortcuts My computer is a MAcbook pro and I am running Macosx 10.8.4\nI just realized that the shortcuts don't work anymore in an application where I really need them. When I went to re-create them in the keyboard System Preference panel, I wasn't able to do it. I could select my application, and name the shortcut I wanted to create, but then it was impossible to type the actual shortcut. I got error beeps and no symbol would appear. \nI don't know what to do at this point.\nAre there some commands I could run in Terminal to fix this issue?\nThank you\n\nA: After you have selected the shortcut you want to change, press the tab key on your keyboard and you will be able to type in the new shortcut.\nAnyway, that is how I solved the problem :-)\n", "Q: Is there any keyboard shortcut to Force Quit all applications? Is there any apple Keyboard Shortcut to force quitting all of my applications?\nI really need this sometimes because i have a old MacBook Air and it freezes if I put more than 14 applications. I just want to ask if there are any KeyBoard shortcuts to force quitting all of the applications using the Apple KeyBoard?\n\nA: You could do it with a script... or you could hit CMD+Tab and while holding CMD hit \"q\" over and over. It will cycle through your apps and quit them one by one pretty quickly.\n\nA: Kind of, but it will require some mouse clicks.\nCMD+Alt+Esc\n\nThat will pop up the \"Force Quit Applications window.  Shift-click the last item so that they are all highlighted and then press \"Force Quit\".  It will ask you to confirm by clicking \"Force Quit\" again.\nThere are probably other ways you could do this with a single shortcut but they would require adding something to your Mac like a script or app.  For instance, you could write an Automater app to quit everything and then create a shortcut in the system preferences to launch the app.  I'm assuming you are asking how to do this on any Mac that is not modified with special programs or scripts.  Ask a new question for writing a script to do this, if that is what you want.\n\nA: This terminates the applications that are included in the force quit window, Dock, and application switcher:\nkill $(osascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to unix id of processes where background only is false'|tr -d ,)\n\nA: Press Command + Option + Esc keys together at the same time. Then a window will pop up.

I tried another browser and it worked fine, so it's some kind of browser issue.\n\nA: This was happening to me because I was using Safari \"Private mode\". When I turned back to \"Non Private Mode\" the problem was solved\n\nA: I had AdBlock Plus and Ghostery running. Disabling both allowed it to work for me.\n\nA: This happened to me one time too. I would check my internet connection first. Internet connection problem is something that happens frequently. After that i would go over all the information that you provided and see if there is a mistake somewhere.\n", "Q: Turn off message sending from iCloud?

And when someone responds to \"myname@icloud.com\", I receive the message on my computer and Wi-Fi only iPad, but not my iPhone. Is there any way to only send and receive messages from a phone number?\n\nA: In your Settings go to Messages> Send & Receive and you should be able to set your preferences from there.

Now, the accounts of the other users are still here. I don't have any of their files, but just the empty shell accounts OS X creates by default. It's still about 250MB per user (from the default stuff OS X puts in, plus caches they used while browsing etc.).\nCan I delete these user folders safely (with sudo)? Or do I need to do some Directory Services magic to make sure OS X knows the users are gone?\nEDIT: The users aren't in my \"/Search/Users\" DirectoryServices list, nor are they in /etc/passwd. Their user folders are shown as being owned by numeric IDs, rather than their actual names.\n\nA: You do need to do some Directory Services magic because normally /etc/passwd doesn't really exist on a Mac and is being created each time you access it from the records in Open Directory.\nTo remove your users from the terminal, run:\ndscl . -delete /Users/username\n\nWhere username is the user you want to remove.\nOtherwise, you should be able to do this from the GUI by going to System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Select the user from the user column and remove it with the minus.  It will ask you about removing the user's home directory and you want to say yes.\n---Edit---\nCheck if the users exist in the system with:\ndscl . -list /Users\n\nIf they don't exist, then you are safe to remove the home directories located in the root of the filesystem at /Users/username.\n\nA: else case delete via sysadminctl\nsudo sysadminctl -deleteUser <username>\n\n", "Q: Remote manage an iPad for a friend I need to help a friend who has an iPad. Talking live on Skype and sharing iMessages, even screenshots, is not cutting it. On a computer I can do with the likes of TeamViewer. \nThis thread here on Apple.StackExchange offers some suggestions, but none of these apps like MobileIron etc do what I want: to control the screen of the target iPad, install apps, configure apps, etc. Just like TeamViewer -- full remote control. \nI am NOT looking for a corporate \"profile management\" type thing. I need to fully control iPad screen of a friend. \nAny recommendations would be super. \n\nA: I'm afraid this is not possible, at least with a non-jailbroken device.\niOS Apps are built as SandBoxes at install time, which means that each App has access only to its own files, and very limited privileges with other of the device's services, such as the phone, sending emails, etc.\nApple states it like this:\n\nFor security reasons, iOS places each app (including its preferences and data) in a sandbox at install time. A sandbox is a set of fine-grained controls that limit the app’s access to files, preferences, network resources, hardware, and so on. As part of the sandboxing process, the system installs each app in its own sandbox directory, which acts as the home for the app and its data.\nImportant: The purpose of a sandbox is to limit the damage that a compromised app can cause to the system.

Many other tools have a single letter shortcut (like the vector tool is just \"V\", no modifiers involved) but when I try to make a single character shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, it won't let me. It appears I have to provide a modifier and character :( Any way around this restriction?\n\nA: You can do this with Keyboard Maestro's Device Key trigger:\n\nDevice Key\nThe macro can be executed when the key is pressed, released or periodically while it is held down.

Is there a way to disable that autostart?\n\nA: OS X provides launchctl to control which daemons are started at boot time.\nTo stop and disable Apache:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal \n\n*Type the following command (type your login password when sudo requests it):\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist\n\nA few words on launchctl's -w option\nThe -w option is the silver bullet for stopping/disabling Apache. It tells launchctl to do its job regardless of any configuration settings that would otherwise prevent it from unloading the service, as explained in man launchctl:\n-w       Overrides the Disabled key and sets it to false or true for the load and\n         unload subcommands respectively. In previous versions, this option would\n         modify the configuration file. Now the state of the Disabled key is stored\n         elsewhere on- disk in a location that may not be directly manipulated by any\n         process other than launchd.\n\n(It turns out that, in OS X Mavericks (10.9), \"elsewhere on-disk\" is /private/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist.)\nThe -w option is indispensable if you started Apache with apachectl start: as explained in this Superuser answer. apachectl not only starts Apache but also modifies /private/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist like this:\n<key>org.apache.httpd</key>\n<dict>\n        <key>Disabled</key>\n        <false/>\n</dict>\n\nIn this particular case you can also use apachectl:\nsudo apachectl stop\n\nto stop Apache and to set Disabled to true.\n", "Q: How do you delete a column in TextEdit? Using TextEdit, I created a table in a RTF document.  Now I want to delete one of the columns in the table, and I see no option anywhere to delete a column.  How do I delete a column in a table in TextEdit?\n\nA: RTF table support is quite limited in TextEdit.\nIf the column you want to get rid of is not the last column in the table (in which case grgarside's answer above is your best option) you can try the procedure below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's say you want to delete column \"c\" below:\n\n\n*Hold down Option to mark the contents of the column (note that the cursor changes shape to a cross):\n\n\n*Now you can either: \n\n\n*\n\n*Press Delete to delete its contents:\n\n\n*Position the cursor in every empty cell and press the fndelete key combination (you can also use the delete ⌦ key, but you will have to rearrange columns later):\n\nuntil you have deleted all of them:\n\nor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Merge in Format > Table...:\n\n\n*Select the contents of the column and delete them by pressing Delete:\n\n\n*Place the cursor in the empty column and press the fndelete key combination (you can also use the delete ⌦ key, but you will have to rearrange columns later) to delete it.\nI wish it were more straightforward, but unfortunately it isn't.\n\nA: If it's the last column in a table, you can reduce the number of columns in the Table inspector, available from Format → Table…\n\n", "Q: Sharing a provisioning profile among team members under a non-company subscription Let's say there are two iOS developers using 4 computers in total, working on the same project.

Is there way to set a keyboard shortcut or key to simulate a mouse right click but without touching trackpad or mouse?\nSpecifically, I am interested in the right click happening away from where the mouse / pointer are located, so it’s different than just a proper right click at the pointer location.\nE.g. Imagine you have a list of files in Finder. You move your selection by going up and down with keyboard arrows. When you are happy with selection, you \"press a button\" and it simulates as if you did a secondary click on the file you selected earlier with the keyboard. The context menu should not open where the mouse pointer is, otherwise I'd have to move it over selection first, which ruins the keyboard-only workflow.\nOn Mac currently, all current right click options requires me to touch trackpad or mouse:\n\n*\n\n*Two finger single tap\n\n\n*CTRL+click\n\n\n*Tap in right area of trackpad if enabled in Trackpad Settings.\nSimilar to following windows option key.\n\n\nA: If you can't enable it in the first method, use the second method.\nMethod 1\nGo to System Preferences > Accessibility, find Mouse & Trackpad, then enable \"Mouse Keys\". If you want, go to the options menu and enable \"Press the Option key five times to toggle Mouse Keys\".\n\nMethod 2\nPress Option-Command-F5, and a window will pop up. Select \"Enable Mouse Keys\".\n\nHow to use Mouse Keys\nTo right click press Fn-Ctrl-I. Sometimes you might want to turn Mouse Keys off as some keys on your keyboard won't function properly. If you are using an external keyboard, just find the equivalent to the function key. To map keys on a Windows keyboard with a Mac, visit this guide.\n\nA: There is some builtin feature you can access by System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Keyboard (sorry I have the german OS X installed so this is my rough translation).\nThere you can find a keyboard shortcut called \"Focus to menubar\" (my shortcut is set to CTRL-F2.\nActivate it, select the file and hit the shortcut keys, then you get the keyboard focus on your menubar. Navigate with the cursor keys to the \"Services\" menu, select the service and hit Enter. \nVoila, the service is executed on the selected file\n\nA: I've been looking for a solution to this for years! I finally chanced upon this RightClick Alfred workflow which does what I was looking for. It looks like it can also be installed as a Finder service.\nThe Alfred workflow works for me on 10.15.5 Catalina, though it does take around 0.5s to pull up the right-click menu. I've validated this works in Notes and Finder, though it may work in other apps too.

After installing, I can't format or reliably use my HDD while it's in the optical bay.\nI installed the SSD in the place of the original HDD and it worked without any problems at all. Then I installed the HDD in the optical bay with the caddy and it seemed to work as well. This HDD was not changed since it was removed from the main drive bay and it still had OS X(and all my other files) on it.\nOne thing I realised at this point was I was unable to boot into my HDD which was not changed at all. Still I was able to access my files and copy over the needed ones to my SSD. I didn't try to do more (write, etc) so I don't know if more functionality was present.\nThen I tried formatting the HDD and it hanged for a long time until I had to power off the computer and start over. I knew this would corrupt the partition scheme(obviously) but I figured that this would be OK and I can just simply reformat later.\nAfter discovering that formatting doesn't work (with the error message: \"disk erase failed with the error wiping volume data to prevent future accidental probing failed\") I tried the command line (diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ HDD1 disk1) but this also throws the error (Error: -69825: Wiping volume data to prevent future accidental probing failed).\nAt this point I took the drive out of the bay, put it in a USB HDD dock, connect it to Windows and format it as FAT32.\nThis worked and when I put the drive back in my Mac it appears to be working until I tried copying a file to the disk. At this point it gave an error(something along the lines of: Can't read and write from the SOURCE_FILE) And when I tried to reformat it in my Mac it again corrupted the disk.\nAt this point I am inclined to think that this is an issue caused by the caddy. To test this I will try putting the SSD in the optical bay and try booting off that. \nIn short: My problem is that I can't format or reliably use my HDD while it's in the optical bay. Any ideas?\n\nA: So the problem was with the cable. Apparently one of the small pins on the cable that connected the optical drive to the motherboard, got broken.\nIf it was a total failure of the drive this may have been more obvious, alas, it was not. It merely caused the drive to work in an unstable manner. \nAs soon as I replaced the flex-cable with a salvaged one, the problem disappeared. \n", "Q: Restoring selected files from time machine backup of a different mac Here's the situation so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*20\" Alum iMac 2007 HDD has died (3 days after I got a new Macbook Pro - coincidence, or suicide?)\n\n*It had a time machine backup on a regular external drive\n\n*I have connected that external drive to my new macbook\n\n*I tried Migration Utility but it wants to copy all files\n\n*\n\n*Q1: Is there any way to make that thing break down to the individual folder or file level?\n\n\n*Giving up on Migration, I want to use Time Machine to restore\n\n*\n\n*I read somewhere that I need to use the Browse Other Time Machine option ... \n\n*But I can't even run Time Machine without setting it up, so I do - I turn it on and point it at my external drive with the old time machine\n\n*Q2: Uh oh - wait a minute, is it going to wipe my old backup and replace it with backup of the new machine?\n\n\n*I turn off Time Machine quickly\n\n*I add a new external drive to another usb port and set up That one as a Time Machine backup for the new machine - turning TM back on.\n\n*More research and I find out that I can get at the Browse feature from the Time Machine icon in the dock. (Why not from the system bar!) Anyway, I put TM in the dock, right-click and sure enough - there it is.\n\n*Now I select my old external TM disk and start to browse\n\n*The Today backup shows only stuff on my new macbook\n\n*\n\n*I guess I created that when I selected it\n\n*But I'm hoping it didn't overwrite my old backups of the old machine\n\n*I see on the timeline on the right various dates going back but I can't select them\n\n\n*Q3: How do I get access to those previous backups - I can see them there in the timeline but can't browse to them (back arrow doesn't work, nor does clicking in the time line - they're all faint purple)\n\n*Now in desperation I look at the old TM drive in Finder - I can browse to the backupdb and see backups for the dates\n\n\n*\n\n*But these dates seem to only include files which I worked with on those dates\n\n*That kind of makes sense for a backup - but ...\n\n\n*Q4: ... is there a way to merge all the date folders in Finder to get the latest version of the folder? Or is that only possible through the TM UI (which doesn't let me access - per Q3)\n\n\nReally finding TM to be very frustrating when moving to a new computer.\n[Update] I found something. It turns out that the reason the backups are there but not selectable in the timeline is to do with the (frustrating) TM UI: It requires that you navigate to the right directory to see it's history.\nI found this out from the tan coloured box on this page: http://pondini.org/TM/E2.html\nThe problem is that the directory structure is not the same on my new machine. I want to explore and retrieve things from the root directory on the old machine. What's more, the user directories like Documents and Pictures are not the same - even though i am using the same user name on both machines, so the path is the same /Users/me - so I can't see the history, of say, Documents.\nHowever, if I click on the All Files link in Finder I can see old files from my back up and can go back through the timeline. But how I do I get at the folder structure.\nTo sum up:\n - I have my TM disk from my broken iMac attached to my new macbook pro\n - I have TM running on the new machine with a different disk and the icon in the doc\n - I right-click and Browse Other Time Machine disk and can select the old one\n - I see a bunch of backups in the timeline but they are greyed out (actually, light purple, if we're being precise - non selectable anyway)\n - If I click on All Files in Finder now, I can see the backups of the files\nBut I really need to be able to explore the file system, not just from the unorganized All Files.\nNote that I tried making local directories with the names of dirs I know to be in the TM backup, but that doesn't work - it recognizes, I think, that these are not the same dirs.\n\nA: Oh Rhubarb, I do feel for you. The pains and struggles you have are a bit too common. \nWhat makes this even tougher is the fact that you probably do need to work and create new documents on the MacBook Pro while at the same time want to recover files. \nI might go and say that you have to do a bit of Terminal trickery as I suspect you have permission issues, OS issues (from the dead iMac and the old TM disk), and maybe haste issues so let's trim the fat and see if we can save your stuff.\nI would say it might be necessary to set the permissions on the external drive to be read and write for every user and directory. You can speed this up by not doing it on the entire disk but just the latest folder with the date name.\nExample: \n\n$ sudo chmod -R 7777 /Volumes/old TM disk/backupsdb/2014-01-01-2350000/\n\nDo not set up the command to running on the \"Latest\" folder/alias. If you aren't familiar with Terminal much then you can just type in the first portion (everything before the first \"/\") and then from Finder drag the latest dated folder into Terminal.\nAfter the folder is in the prompt hit enter and you will need to enter your MacBook Pro's admin password (be aware that terminal will not print any *) so you will be typing blind.\nNow this can take time, estimate that if your hard drive is healthy/ no structure or hardware issues it will be about 100GB per hour. So run this and let the system do it's thing (perhaps disable screen saver but turn brightness down so that you don't waste energy. ;)\nOnce the command has finished check to see if you can access the files now from Finder in that folder you dragged into Terminal. Then try and see what the Time Machine.app says when you browse the files. If that resolved things super.\nIf not then you might want to consider something else. If you have the space on the MacBook Pro's internal drive, consider saving just the User folder from the dated folder you chmod'd before. I prefer rsync for this and would suggest creating a temporary folder on your MacBook Pro for this action maybe Macintosh HD/Recovered TM User\nExample:\n\n$ sudo rsync -av /Volumes/old TM disk/backupsdb/2014-01-01-2350000/Users/ /Recovered TM User\n\nAgain this copy could take approximately an hour per 100 GB but speeds depend on file number and size.\nTry these things out to your discretion and get back to us! Qapla'\n\nA: Before going into Time Machine, open a Finder window and choose \"Computer\" from the Finder's Go menu. (That's the key to being able to browse another computer's backup drive.)\nThen hold the option key and choose \"Browse Other Backup Disks\".\n\nA: The easiest way to do what you are looking for is \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder -> Go -> Computer\n\n*Option Click on Time Machine Icon -> Browse other Backup Disks\n\n\nAt this point Time Machine will recognize the older backups and allow you to browse through history of the entire filesystem and restore files and directories as you would expect.\n\nA: Just Checking that you have not missed the \"holding option key down in time machine\" thing that I missed for ages:\nSource:\nhttp://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/complete-guide-time-machine-mac-backup-3626572/\nComplete guide to Time Machine: Can I browse Time Machine backups from another Mac, or older Time Machine backups from my own Mac that I no longer use?\nYes. Attach the disk, or attach the Time Capsule to your main Wi-Fi/internet router, then hold down Alt (Option on some keyboards) on your Mac and click the Time Machine menu bar icon. Select Browse Other Backup Disks. The Time Machine disk should appear in a list, and once you've selected it you'll see the standard Finder-based Time Machine view where you can move back in time to retrieve older files.\nIf the backup is encrypted you'll be prompted to enter the password before you can gain access.\nThis worked well for me so thought I would share here.\n\nA: There may be an easier and quicker way that just worked for me if you have disk permission issues. The first part of the task is the same:\nOpen Finder -> Go -> Computer\nOption Click on Time Machine Icon -> Browse other Backup Disks\nFind the file(s) or directories you want to copy within the other machine's Time Machine backup and press restore.\nIf the restore option is not available, close Time Machine. The window with the files you want is now visible in your finder (a Christmas miracle...). You can now copy the files wherever you want like a regular Finder operation. No disk permission fix necessary.\n\nA: If you want to browse individual files from a backup and then restore them or move them somewhere, I'd suggest the software BackupLoupe, which lets you do exactly this!\n\nA: I've not seen this mentioned yet...\nThe .sparseimage can be mounted like any other disk image. Double-click to mount it. Inside you will find one folder per computer. Inside each computer's folder, you will find one folder per backup. Inside the per-backup folder will be the entire filesystem looking like you would expect it to. \nIf you have any trouble mounting the disk image, try using Disk Utility (under File>Open Disk Image...)\nAlso, will second that BackupLoupe is a good option if you frequently find yourself fighting Time Machine. It's basically an all-options-exposed GUI for TimeMachine \n\nA: There's a simpler way without even start TM.\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your external disk\n\n*In Finder, browse the external disk\n\n*Look for a folder \"Backups.backupdb\"\n\n*Underneath it, you will find a folder with your other computer's name\n\n*Drilling down, you can find folders with date-of-backup\n\n", "Q: How much power can be drawn from the lightning connector by a external device? How much power can be drawn from the iPhone/iPad lightning connector by a external device?\nUpdate: The use case is a audio-related device for iPhone/iPads.

I found a lot of people figuring out why instruction similar to this :\n\nPut X to your ~/.bashrc and you can do Y\n\n\ndon't work.\nIt always turns out that Mac OS X's bash's startup files (or Mac's Bash itself) doesn't source ~/.bashrc file, either in the login shell, or in a shell spawned from window system - like Terminal app in Mac OS X)\nWhy is this, when all other Unix-like systems with Bash I've worked with before have done this?\nPS:\nI found what Bash itself says about startup files (which could be helpful) :\n\nWhen Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a\n  non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and\n  executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.\n  After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login,\n  and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from\n  the first one that exists and is readable.

Use a tool like SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to image the old SSD onto the new one. Then switch the drives around, keeping the old one as a backup drive.\n\nA: How can I take everything from the current SSD and then upload it to the new SSD - effectively giving me the same machine without installing OSX all over again?\nI upgraded my SSD some time ago in a similar configuration (128 GB->256 GB, MacBook Pro 15-inch early 2011).\nBelow is the procedure that worked for me, but note that for this to work your Mac must support OS X Internet Recovery. According to KB article \"OS X: About OS X Recovery\" (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718):\n\nMac models introduced after public availability of OS X Lion include\nthe ability to start up directly from an Internet-based version of the\nOS X Recovery system.\n\nwhich means that models manufactured before July 20, 2011 need a firmware update.\nIn your case you must have MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010) EFI Firmware Update 2.5 or later installed, and that's probably the case, because most firmware updates are available as regular updates in Software Update/App Store.\nTo find out whether it is installed: Go to Apple menu > About This Mac, press System Report...:\n\nand check if Boot ROM/SMC Version Information is MB71.0039.B0E or greater. If that's the case, you're good to go. Otherwise install it.\nThese are the steps:\n\n*\n\n*Back up old SSD with Time Machine by selecting \"Back Up Now\" in menu bar:\n\n\n\n*Shut down Mac and replace SSD.\n\n\n*Start Mac while holding down ⌘-R and choose \"Restore From Time Machine Backup\":\n\n\n\n*Choose new SSD drive as target, wait until restore is completed and reboot.\nThis will let you keep everything.\n\nA: Best practice IMO:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an external HDD mount(or SDD mount - they are the same), and put your current SSD in it leaving it at it is right now.\n\n*Put your new SSD in the Macbook and install a clean version of OSX.\n\n*You can now copy everything you think you need from the one SSD to the other, leaving you with a clean install without possible installed rubbish and overhead files you do not need. (This will always leave you with more empty space than doing a full copy of your current SSD)\n\n\nSince it's at maximum 128GB we're talking about, this is the best way without getting corrupt data or files.\n\nA: Here is how I did it. @jaume solution should be fine but in my case ⌘-R did not work (endless loadscreen). And with installer USB Stick it failed. You don't need Time Machine for my solution.\nYou need an USB SATA adapter or external case. Mount either your old HDD or your new SSD via USB.\nBoot from an USB Stick with e.g. Snow Leopard or what have you (Hold ALT / Option key while booting). Alternatively I think it's the same as ⌘-R (if you don't have installer stick and don't end up in endless load screen). Select Language and instead of going through the wizard click on Utilities in top menu and select Disc Manager. Click on the restore tab and drag&drop your old HDD as source and your new SSD as destination and press start.\nI was very surprised that this hard drive clone feature comes with MacOS installer (since Snow Leopard).\n", "Q: How do I change askForPasswordDelay from the command line? dwrite alone doesn't work I normally run my Mac with a very long password delay on the screensaver.

I need to open the system preferences after I run these commands in order for the defaults write to get registered. And if the Preferences pane is open, it never gets registered.\nI think that the Preferences pane is doing something else --- that is, I think that the information about how long to sleep or be in screen saver before a password is required is being stored someplace other than this defaults entry and the Preference pane is copying from one to another.\nHow do I make the Mac immediately require a screensaver password without opening the preferences pane? How do I have the password not be required for 60 minutes? How do I get MacOS to respect the dwrite ?

I'm not sure whether you can do that with the built-in Internet Sharing, because as you noticed it will shut off sharing if there is no connection available to share. However, you ought to be able to solve this with a cheap wireless router. Even with no WAN connection the router should hand out addresses, so you can connect to the Mac by assigned IP.\n\nA: Try this:\nOn the mac:  Right click the wi-fi icon\nClick Create network.  By default it will use the name you have given your mac as the network name.\nOn the other host, it should see the new network.  Join it.\n", "Q: How to sync 30 days of mail in the mail app? I find managing multiple browser windows on OSX a real pain with no solution, so I decided to get rid of some tabs. \nI loaded up gmail into the OSX Mail client, but it wants to sync my entire account. Is it possible to sync only new stuff? Basically I want it to only sync the last 30 days and not everything...\nIt's trying to sync about 6gb worth of mail...\n\nA: You can't do this in the OS X Mail client. Mail.app will download all your emails available on the server.\nThe workaround is to make the change on the server. You mention that you have Gmail, therefore you can go to Gmail's IMAP settings and restrict the amount of emails available (for example, the most recent 1000).\n\nAlso, you can exclude labels from being visible to IMAP, therefore Mail won't download the contents.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Gmail.com\n\n*Click on the gear in the top right (settings)\n\n*'See All Settings'\n\n*on the top/middle 'Forwarding and POP/IMAP'\n\n*scroll down, 'Folder size limits' Limit IMAP folders to contain no more than 1000 message (or whatever you decide)\n\nYou make the change in Gmail settings but it only affects IMAP clients like Mail app. All messages will still be stored in Gmail.\n", "Q: Export local contacts from iPhone My primary means of handling contacts on my iPhone is gmail sync, but somehow it appears I have added a number of contacts to my phone locally. I want just these local contacts to sync back to gmail.\nI'm fine with exporting and then importing to gmail, and then deleting the local contacts off my phone. However, I can't seem to find any good way of doing this.\n\nA: You can do this with My Contacts Backup. This will allow you to export all your local contacts as vCard which can be imported into Gmail.\n\n\n\nRemove your Gmail account from your device (so that only the local contacts are backed up), then backup your contacts. You can then import the .vcf into your Gmail.\n", "Q: Remap curved quotation marks in OS X? So, the default key combinations to manually insert curved quotation marks (“” and ‘’) in OS X are:\n\n\n*\n\n*option + [ for “\n\n*option + ] for ‘\n\n*option + shift + [ for ”\n\n*option + shift + ] for ’\n\n\nPossibly due to muscle memory and the mental association with the keys ([ being an \"opening\" symbol and ] being a \"closing\" one) I find this specific setup very confusing, so I'll always get it wrong when inserting curved quotation marks manually.

Instead, they open in whatever Space already happens to have an open window of the application. I've noticed this particularly with Microsoft Office programs, as I tried to reproduce it with Preview and Terminal windows but they seemed to behave properly, so I think that this problem lies within the MS Office suite.\nI imagine that this is related to this question, but this occurs with windows that aren't minimized.

For example Windows might say 64GB of space remain, but in reality the size of the image it is in is actually a lot smaller. See here:\n\nAs you can see it only takes up 34GB rather than 64GB. A way to reduce space would be to uninstall applications or features you do not need within windows.

The original issue was with the battery dying a way too fast (would go down from a little over 90% to just under 70% while using the phone for about 10 minute navigation trip). After I brought it to the Apple Store, I was told it's not the battery, but rather to OS was corrupted and it causing the battery to drain. The fix is very simple, a restore to the factory default.\nHowever, that's where I ran into issues. We have some photos on that iPhone we want to preserve, so I tried coping them over to my Windows 7 laptop using explorer (direct access to DCIM folder), using Windows picture export future as well as iexplorer software and Picasa to no real luck.\nNow I should add that not all pictures are affected, just the ones that were transferred from the iPhone 4s.

I've a little logitech mouse, and suddenly, with no reasons, it started to lag heavily, and now it's impossibile to use. I've a MBP mid 2012 13'', and never had problems, but now it is unusable. The mouse is ok, i've tried it on another mac and it works fine. I've already tried to reset the controller, but nothing changed.\nI really can't understand what could  be the problem? when i restart the mac it works fine for a while and then restart lagging.\nAny ideas or similar experience?\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my 2011 17\" MBP and Apple magic mouse.  Frustrated the hell out of me.  I turned off Handoff (Continuity) on my iOS devices and the problem has since disappeared.  \n\nA: It's radio interference and how OS X handles it and Logitech handle it.  since one of the tags by the OP is \"bluetooth\" I think it's safe to say that a Logitech BT mouse is in use here.\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nBluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over\n  short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM\n  band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz[4])\n\nYou know what else uses 2.4Ghz spectrum of wireless?\nWiFi and the  Logitech Unifying Receiver\nI had a Logitech MX Master BT mouse that worked perfectly on Windows 10 on a Surface Pro 3.  On my iMac on the exact same desk, the mouse lagged.  All I did was switch from SP3 to iMac and the issues showed up.  I have the same problem with the unifying receiver as well, though not as bad.  It works perfectly on Win10, but lags on Mac.    It has been documented on Logitech forums.\nWhen I was researching it, it came down to a driver and how either Apple or Logitech had to do something to fix the BT connectivity issue.  I didn't save the link, but when I get time, I will re-search again for it and post it here.  So basically, it's something the hardware manufacturer has to address.  There's nothing outside of getting a different BT mouse from a different manufacturer that will fix the problem.\n", "Q: How to make Mac shut down when fully charged? Since I have heard that keeping on the charger plugged while the battery is at 100% will degrade battery life, I would like to find a way to make the Mac switch off by itself when it reaches 100%. This is mainly for when I want to charge the laptop overnight.\nIs the first claim true? Also, if it is, how can I get the Mac to shut down by itself when it reaches 100% charge?\n\nA: The claim is not true.\nThe only thing that has been proven to degrade battery life is heat, which also means overnight charging with your Mac sleeping is better than charging it while in use.\nSwitching it off doesn't make a difference.\n\nA: Straight from the source:\n\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time. An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge.\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html\nAnd for more information this is a useful page:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1446\n", "Q: How can I give an app permanent permission so it doesn't ask for my password every time? I am using an application called Hostbuddy to manage entries in my hosts file. It works great, the only problem is that is asks for my password every time I use it, which adds up to a lot of inconvenience. How can I permanently give Hostbuddy the permission it needs? The two things it asks for the password for are to modify the hosts file and to flush my DNS cache.\nPS, I understand the security implications of this, and I trust the app.\n\nA: I do not think this is the app that requires the password, but the host file itself. The host file is owned by root and requires a password to edit. Hostbuddy is probably just requesting the password in order to modify the file. A way to fix this would be to take ownership of the file (not recommended due to security reasons). Another way would be to run Hostbuddy as administrator (but I believe this requires a password anyway just to start it).\nIf you for some reason want to take the security risk for convenience you should take ownership of the host file OR run Hostbuddy as administrator.\nEDIT: IMPLEMENTATION\nIn order to achieve this I believe you must set the setuid bit on the application. To do so I suggest making a new user group that only you are in and using that to gain root access to the app. To do this start by opening System Preferences and going to Users and Groups. You are going to want to make a new group by selecting the '+' button at the bottom left of the window. Go ahead and create a new group by the name 'HostBuddy' Without the quotes like so:\n\nNext you need to set yourself as a member of this group like so:\n\nFinally we need to do some work within the terminal. Go ahead and open up Terminal.app and navigate to where HostBuddy is (probably /Applications) like so:\n\nAfter doing this we set the setuid bit for the application itself under your group name and set permissions with two more commands like this (remember it is cAsE SenSiTIve!):\n\nThis should allow you to click and run the app as root without needing a password. Since we added a group to the mix this also means other users on your computer do not have that privilege. They must enter a password each time. Only your particular user (or others in the HostBuddy group) get a password-free experience.\n", "Q: Two local networks: routing confusion On my 17\" MBP (running Mavericks) I'm sometimes signed on to two different LANs, one with my AirPort interface and one with Ethernet. My Networks are set up (in the Network System Preference Panel) such that the Ethernet service is higher priority than the AirPort.\nSometimes (not always), when I try to connect to an IP address on the network I'm connected to via AirPort, it (I assume) tries to connect to the IP via the Ethernet network and eventually times out. Pinging an IP on the AirPort network also fails.\nI set up the Ethernet network as higher priority than the AirPort network, so it's working as intended, you say - 'what's the problem'? Well, the IP I'm trying to connect to is a local IP (e.g. 192.168.x.x), while the Ethernet router's IP is like 10.0.0.1, and it's assigning IP addresses using DHCP like 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3, etc. So if I try to connect to say 192.168.1.2, why is it trying to go over Ethernet, in 10.0.0.x land? How do I have to set up the networks so that the laptop \"realizes\" it needs to use the AirPort interface for connecting to 192.168.x.x addresses? BTW, reversing the service order just makes it so I have the same problem in reverse - suddenly all connections to Ethernet IPs time out.\nEdit:\nI'm providing some concrete info below to help diagnose the problem. Today, for no apparent reason, the situation is reversed - my Ethernet network, which routes to the Internet, is working fine, but packets to my AirPort network (10.11.12.*) are being incorrectly routed through the Ethernet network (192.168.20.*). I wonder if this has to do with the order in which I connected to the networks when I got to work this morning.\nNotice that it attempts to route packets to 10.11.12.13 via 192.168.20.1 which is the \"default-er\" gateway (above 10.11.12.13). I have full control of both routers, so I can change their configuration as necessary to keep the two networks from becoming confused on my MBP.

The non-Internet-connected network (the one I usually access via AirPort) had its router set up incorrectly. I got a way out from the Unix guys here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/113622/21486\nBasically if you set up a hostapd wireless access point on a Linux machine and you're using DHCP, you need to make sure you don't have an option routers line in your dhcpd.conf. That line will make the router advertise to clients a spurious default gateway which, depending on the alignment of the planets, will blackhole your traffic intended for the other network.\n", "Q: Can't download anything with enough storage? I have 478 MB available, and this game is 228 MB. Every time I try to download it, I get a message saying I don't have enough space. But I do. What am I supposed to do?! I really want this app!\n\nA: You actually don't have the required space.\nApps are shipped in containers called IPAs. An IPA is actually just a zip file, and compresses some of the content. Each app, depending on how they are built, can achieve varying degrees of compression.\n\nIn the above image, you can see just how much disparity exists between the App Store's reported size and the actual install size.\nInfinity Blade 3 is listed at 1.7GB by the App Store, but installs to 2.6GB. Additionally, Bastion reports requiring 534MB, but actually needs more than twice that amount of space (1.2GB).\nSince it would be impossible for Apple to gather the required information from actual install size, they offer the size of the IPA as a guideline. To be safe, one should allow for 3x the existing space. In your case, you may require about 800MB free (ballpark).\nAnd remember, you need some free space (for caches, app data, etc.). It's unwise to operate with absolutely no free space, typically leading to a negative impact on performance.\n\nA: Delete something you don't want to free up a smidge more space - assuming it's not a bogus error message.\n\nA: This happen to me all the time on my iPod touch. What i do leave more than 200-300mb of the required storage and after that it works for me.\n\nA: Bear in mind that for an App to be installed you need more free space in your device than the actual App's size. This is so because the download is done in a temporary folder (you download an .ipa file, which is compressed). Once the download is completed, the App is uncompressed and installed in the appropriated directory.\nThis is true for updates, too. When an update is downloaded, it is installed in a new App directory, and then the user's data is moved from the old installation directories into the new ones. The old installation is then deleted.\n\nA: Whenever you download a file, it's not the size you think it is. It may say 200 MB but turns out to be 600 MB. For example when you download a rar, you unpack it and the rar is only 2 Gb but when you unpacked it, it's like 4GB.\nThis happens because the RAR is compressed, simply the app format is compressed but when you have it, it's larger in size.\n\nA: The best way to free up space is to go to Settings > General > Usage and to look at whats taking up your storage. You'll probably find apps that take up a lot of storage that you never even use! This is probably the best way to free up space.\nFor more information and tips, I wrote a little blog post about the subject here.\n", "Q: iTunes sync mysteriously failing in various ways I have an iPhone 4S with iOS 7.0.4, and my MacBook (10.6.8) has iTunes 11.1.4.\nI have a few small mp3 files that I want to copy from my MacBook to my iPhone.\nWhen I connect the phone to the MacBook and initiate a sync, it always fails in 1 of 2 ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes would push Flashlight and Facebook to my phone and then would say \"Canceling sync\" and stop.  I do not want Facebook, and I do not want Flashlight either since one is already built into iOS.  But I'd be willing to have them if it's required for my mp3s to sync.\n\n*or iTunes hangs on the last step of the sync, \"Waiting for changes to apply.\"\n\n\nMy iTunes says that it's the latest version, and so does my iOS.  And I've restarted my phone and MacBook several times.\nHow can I fix this problem?  It's not specific to which mp3 files.\n\nA: Make sure that the \"Automatically install new apps\" option under the \"Apps\" tab when in the iPhone settings in iTunes is UNchecked.\nNext, from the \"Summary\" tab of your iPhone settings in iTunes, check the \"Manually manage music and videos\". \nFinally manually drag/drop the mp3 tracks you wish to add to the iPhone to the open iTunes window when it is focused on your iPhone music. This will directly add the songs without the need to sync the iPhone.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro battery life tanking even after battery replacement? I've been having some issues with battery life on my MacBook Pro (15\", Mid 2010).  I thought I had tracked it down when I found out that the battery was near the end of its life (only holding 60% of its maximum charge) and replaced it with a new one and reset the SMC.  \nHowever, the battery still drains at an incredibly fast rate, draining in 90 minutes or less with no applications running. The new battery is at 98% of design capacity (6760mAh) and has 7 loadcycles on it, so it doesn't seem to be the culprit.  \nThe one thing that is a possibility is I've noticed some weird behavior from Notification Center—it seems to jump up to 100%+ CPU usage for spurts of time, which I could definitely see as a battery drain (which is a question in itself: why the heck would it be doing that?)\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions as to what could be causing battery drain?\n\nA: If something is using that much CPU it will definitely eat your battery. I'm not completely sure what is causing it but you might wan to download the latest update to your OS (10.9.1 or something of the sort) and re-install it. If it keeps happening you might need to reinstall OS X. I hate re-installing an operating system if at all necessary but I'm not sure what is causing the CPU spike. \n\nA: Before a reinstall I would do some troubleshooting with:\ntop -o cpu\nonce you find the culprit using your cpu, I would see what is going on using \nopensnoop\n", "Q: How to Exit iOS Recovery Mode My iOS device is stuck in Recovery Mode.\n\nHow do I exit this mode?\n\nA: iOS 7\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the home button and the lock button at the same time.\n\n*Keep holding them down until you see the Apple logo then release the\nbuttons and you should be finished!\nSource: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX9VM590pvo\niOS 6\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the TinyUmbrella application.\n\n*Connect your iPhone or iPod in Recovery mode to your Mac or PC using its USB cable.\n\n*Open TinyUmbrella and give it a few seconds until it recognizes your device.\n\n\n\nSource: http://www.guidingtech.com/16182/get-iphone-out-of-recovery-mode/\n\nA: Try holding down the power and the home button until the screen turns white, then let go and it should reboot\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure that the device is NOT connected anywhere via a USB cable\n\n*Hold down the Home button and the Power button at the same time for 10 seconds. (or until you see your iDevice booting up regularly).\n\n\nIf that does not help, make sure to leave your iDevice to charge for at least an hour and try the above procedure again.  \n", "Q: MacBook performance while on battery vs plugged in Should I expect my MacBook Air to run slower while on battery vs while plugged in?\nIn other words, will it slow down the CPU/graphics/etc while on battery to conserve power?\n\nA: Yes, sort of. Intel uses a technology called SpeedStep. This technology allows the CPU (and in your case, shared GPU) to adjust its clock speed on the fly, in order to balance performance with power consumption.\nWhen your MacBook Air (MBA) is plugged in (on AC), it is fed the energy it needs, and thus the CPU doesn't have to concern itself with conservation. Conversely, when your MBA is running on battery power, conservation is quite important. In this case, the system will balance performance needs and power consumption in an effort to elongate battery life.\nNaturally, your MBA won't be \"slower,\" but the CPU cycles will be allocated in a much more sparingly.\nA classic case of software and hardware working together to enhance the user experience (and just another way for Apple to maximize up time).\nWhile I have not personally tried this software, CoolBook claims to have the ability to disable SpeedStep (among other features). Though on their site, they do list that a lack of support for \"i3/i5/i7 CPUs\", which is unfortunately what most modern Macs are using.\n\nA: Absolutely. I own a 2013 MacBook Air (13 inch) and the way Intel's new CPUs work are quite nice. It basically conserves power while you are on battery but will kick up when you need it. So I can play Team Fortress 2 on battery with no lag, but once I quit Team Fortress 2 it goes back to saving energy again.\n", "Q: Fans run after Macbook Pro lid is shut The fans in my MBP will continue to run for a minute or two after I close the lid. This is frustrating because I often want to close it and immediately put it away in its soft zipper case but I don't want to put it in the case while it's still spitting out hot air. Any ideas why the fans don't turn off immediately (or within like 15 seconds)? This started happening after I upgraded to 10.9.\n\nA: This typically happens when the CPU has been working and the system needs to push more hot air out. I think the firmware within the machine manages this but I'm not quite sure. My air does it and I just put it away anyway. I've never experienced anything bad with it.\n", "Q: How to set up a local calendar while using iCloud for other calendar on mavericks I would like to have some additional calendars that are not synced through iCloud on one of my computers. I have been using this calendar to run small programs at certain times. These programs are however only (a) available on this one machine and (b) would not even be allowed on e.g. an iPad. \nAs I am currently forced to sync the calendar to all my devices however my iPad is turning the custom alerts into normal standard alerts. Breaking the entire calendar. \nIs there a way around this? Thanks!\n\nA: A co-worker figured this one out for us:\nIn Calendar, go to Calendar: Accounts, select your accounts you are using in Calendar and uncheck \"calendar\" from the section where it says \"Use With\".\nOnce there are no internet accounts available, Calendar will allow you to set up an \"On My Mac\" local calendar.\nOnce that's set up, re-check the \"Use With: Calendars\" checkbox and all should be well.\nCaveat: for us, we were able to check and uncheck this setting without having to set anything up again.  I won't guarantee this will be the case for you, so be sure you know how to set up your accounts again and as always, have backups.  \n\nA: I've managed to do this (by accident). I created an exchange account that does not work but is still on the Mac as an account. I now can create local calendars under this in the calendar app and use them to launch applications etc. Seems to work well so far and does not sync to iCloud or any other devices.\n\nA: There's another easy workaround to this.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck \"Calendar\" inside Systems Preferences/iCloud.  At this point, you won't see any of your icloud calendars.\n\n*Now create a new calendar, and that will be put under \"On My Mac\".  You can call it anything or just untitled.  This creates the \"On My Mac\" folder for you.\n\n*Re-check \"Calendar\" inside Systems Preferences/iCloud.  Now you can drag any or all of your iCloud calendars onto your local folder.\n\n\nA: This answer in another thread seems to be the safest way to do it since you don't have to uncheck/disable any iCloud calendars to set up a local one (and still works under Catalina).\nAs a summary: in the Calendars-Sidebar click in the Other-section (where Birthdays and Holidays are displayed). Select New Calendar, this one will be created \"on your mac\". This category is displayed at the top of the sidebar.\n\n", "Q: Upgrade JRE in Mavericks Am trying to run eclipse in maverick but a dialog box says that version 1.7.0 or later is needed to run Google plugin for Eclipse.

I stumbled upon some instructions in the book \"Pro Git\" \nIt suggests:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download this file :\nhttps://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash\n\nIf you use the Bash shell, Git comes with a nice auto-completion\n  script you can enable. Download it directly from the Git source code\n  at\n  https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash\n  . Copy this file to your home directory, and add this to your\n  .bashrc file:\n\nsource ~/git-completion.bash\n\n\nSource https://github.com/progit/progit/blame/master/en/02-git-basics/01-chapter2.markdown#L1115\n(putting this line in .bashrc will not work in Mac OS X systems which I discussed here: Why doesn't Mac OS X source ~/.bashrc?)\n\n*Put this file git-completion.bash ( in\n    /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d if you want bash completion\n    (for the git command) to work on all user accounts.  (As if bash reads all the scripts in\n/opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d)\n\nIf you want to set up Git to automatically have Bash shell completion\n  for all users, copy this script to the\n  /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d directory on Mac systems or to the\n  /etc/bash_completion.d/ directory on Linux systems. This is a\n  directory of scripts that Bash will automatically load to provide\n  shell completions.\n\nSource :\nhttps://github.com/progit/progit/blame/master/en/02-git-basics/01-chapter2.markdown#L1119\n\nI found out that Mac OS's bash DOES NOT read scripts inside /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d.  I put the file there (I created all the folders, because they didn't exist) :\n\nAnd git completion doesn't work on any account. \nDoes Mac OS X's bash read scripts for all users from /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d ?\nIs the \"Pro Git\" book wrong ? Can I report it on their Github page ? \nOr am I wrong ?\n\nA: Bash only reads scripts by default in your home directory, or if they are missing in /etc. See Bash's documentation. If using OSX's Terminal.app then by default it reads ~/.bash_profile.\nThis is true of all bash on Linux or other OSes.\nTo read from another directory e.g. /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d you have to edit your start up files to source (i.e. include) the files from there\nThe instructions for the script do not mention /opt/local/... which is a non standard location on any Unix. (by non-standard it is allowed to be used by third party packages but not defined what should be in there) They say\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-completion.sh).\n  \n*Add the following line to your .bashrc/.zshrc:\nsource ~/.git-completion.sh\n\n  \n*Consider changing your PS1 to also show the current branch,\n   see git-prompt.sh for details.\n  \n\nThe progit quote assumes you know bash. All it is saying is put the files from the first quote into a specific place if you want all users on the machine to use them and not in ~ where only the user installing it can see them. i.e. the point is multi user versus single user. \nHe also picks that path as nothing else uses it and you should not edit /etc files in OS X as Apple's OS upgrades could overwrite them so you need to choose another place. (I would have chosen something under /usr/local as there is where manually maintained scripts are meant to go).\n~/.bashrc is the correct place to edit and add the source. See your other question and the bash manual for setting up ~/.bash_profile The bash suggested way is source .bashrc into .bash_profile. Note that on OS X using Terminal.app is not the one way of running shells so there can be sessions starting with .bashrc.\n\nA: The core bash completion files are not installed as part of OS X so there is nowhere to add your git completion for it to be picked up by the core.\nI apologise but I'm not sure how I installed bash completion but I think I used MacPorts, you can also use Homebrew.\nI do have the folder /usr/local/opt/bash-completion/etc/bash_completion.d which contains completion files for a number of command line tools. The bash_completion function certainly reads all the files in this directory.\nSo you first need to install bash-completion then the git completion file and all will be well.\n\nA: Since none of the above answers got your check, why not move over to zsh which has a more uniform completion stack. \n\n\n*\n\n*What are the practical differences between Bash and Zsh?\nYes the bash book needs to be corrected and yes, you have to do more work to get that working universally, but for most people having one account working seems good enough for bash. \n", "Q: Is it required to use XCode v5 to host an IOS Mobile App in itunesconnect.com?

That's why I am scared it might get removed. \nConcerning the os version, I tend to say as close possible to the version that came with the mac at the time. The more recent the OS the more resource hungry they are. I prefer to have a fast mac then an up to date OS. I would stay to 10.6, but there are some applications could help me and are only running on 10.7.\n\nA: MySQL, as well as the databases, is still there and working after upgrading. This said, all the settings, php, mysql, apache, virtual hosts, where resetted to the default. Very annoying I have to rebuild all my development environment.\n", "Q: Is S/MIME in iOS 7 buggy? I recently imported my S/MIME certificate into iOS 7. I am able to read signed/encrypted message sent from my mac to the iPhone.\nBUT\nI am UNABLE to send signed / encrypted mails from the iPhone.\nThis is strange:\n\n\n*\n\n*First I open the Mail app and start composing a mail. Immediately I see that the messages will be send encrypted (according hint in the app). But how can the app know, that it will send encrypted mail BEFORE I entered a recipient?\n\n*Also, as soon as I tap into one of the fields (CC, BCC, etc) the hint \"encrypted\" disappears\n\n*I am not able to encrypt / sign mails\n\n\nPretty complicated to describe. Any similar experiences? Buggy?\n\nA: You need to have, installed on your iPhone, the public key of the person you intend to send an encrypted message to.\nMail.app on OS X imports the certificates of people who send you mail, automatically. On iOS, you have to do it manually, unless your iPhone is part of a corporate deployment.\nIt's easy! Simply find an email the recipient has sent to you, tap the checkmark icon next to their name, tap \"view certificate\", and tap \"install\".\n\n\nA: The mail can only be encrypted as long as the recipient als uses S/MIME encryption and the mail client knows the recipient's public key. As long as you do not meet that requirements, your mail will be signed, will include a public key, but will not be encrypted.\n", "Q: How to add notes to iCloud via sending an email I use a lot of notes apps on my iPad IOS 7, and I like the option of adding a note via sending the note to a custom email address instead of opening the app and adding the note manually (Like evernote for example).\nStill, I couldn't find such functionality regarding iCloud Notes ! I have iCloud Notes syncing my notes from two sources\n(1) from my iDevices and (2) from my gmail notes folder\nIn Gmail, I tried sending an email to myself; forwarding; and auto labeling them, that did move the emails to notes folder but they did not sync to iCloud.\nI have searched pages and pages of google and noooo clue. Does anyone have any idea or a workaround to apply this on iCloud notes ?\n\nA: Although I, personally, do not use the Notes.app (preferring Simplenote) my Wife uses the Notes.app in conjunction with her gmail account.\nSo if you have a gmail account it has a notes label that will add emails with that label to your notes. \nIt should be easy enough to create a rule to route any emails to that address with a specific phrase in the subject line to mark it as read and with the notes label.\nThis is not exactly what you were looking for. It requires a gmail account which may be a no-starter for some people, and I don't think that Apple has a way to create a note from an email other than copy/paste. But it might be worth looking into.\n", "Q: Flickering Static when Connecting Macbook Pro to LED TV I'm trying to connect my Macbook Pro Late 2011 (OS X 10.8) to a LED TV. I'm getting this flickering static shown on the screenshot below. It also comes with a \"bursting\" sound whenever the static appears. Happens once every couple of seconds.\nThings I've found out:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's no problem with the cable (a Griffin Mini DisplayPort to HDMI connector). I actually brought it back to the store and it worked just fine using the shop's MacBook Pro and external monitor combination.\n\n*Cables are properly connected. I've checked and pushed the connection points a dozen times to make sure this is not the cause.\n\n*There's no problem with the TV. It works just fine when connected to an iPad, or to a PS3. \n\n*Problem also happens on a different TV (LCD).\nI've done some research and solutions recommended would be to reset the parameter RAM and the SMC. Before I go to such measures, anyone with an idea about what could be causing this problem?\n\n\nA: I cannot comment your question, but maybe you can narrow the problem down by using gfxCardStatus to force the macbook to use either internal or discrete video card. I'm thinking it may be a problem with either.\nAlso, can you get rid of the flickering by forcing the plugs a bit in any direction with your fingers?\n\nA: You did not tell if you tried using your Macbook and the Griffin cable with other kinds of external monitors (i.e. projectors, computer monitors). I had flickering problem before because of poor cable contact. From what you described, I would focus my suspect very much on the Macbook mini display port and image setting. Just an idea, you may try reducing resolution for the image you put on the LCD TV, and changing color mode on the LCD TV (i.e. PAL, NTSC, AUTO etc) \n\nA: Have you tried all the refresh rate settings? I have seen similar problems when operating at a resolution beyond what the TV (or graphics card?) is capable of.\nCycle through every resolution setting and each refresh rate available at each resolution. If it is too hard to control the display dialog box do \"gather windows\" on the main display and you can control the TV settings from there (the dialog box moves over to the main view).\nIt is easier to do this all if you have mirroring mode off (Arrangement > uncheck \"Mirroring Mode\") so the main display stays at its native resolution.\n\nA: Have you tried a different HDMI cable?\nI recently experienced a problem with a Roku 3 that sounds similar.  During boot, the Roku displayed its boot screen successfully.  However, once it got past that point (I assume it switched video modes,) the display went to flickering black with rare bursts of proper video.  I replaced the cable (after constant pestering from my better half) and voila!  I was dumbfounded, yet thought if you hadn't tried it, that might be the next avenue to pursue.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Eventually worked out that it only did this with HDMI cables (Tried 3 different ones) that had 'shielding' (High density triple shielding for maximum noise rejection).  Tried a few cables with no shielding and it worked every time...\nThe shielded cables worked fine with other laptops in our office though.\n", "Q: Deleted all partitions from Mac mini except Boot Camp, now can't reinstall OS X I have a Mac Mini without DVD drive (2010), and I used Boot Camp to install Windows 8.\nEverything worked but after I played in Windows with the partitions (I wanted to expand the partition of the Mac). I made mistake and deleted every partition (even Recovery HD) except from my Boot Camp partition. Since then, my Mac mini only boots into Windows. I can't install OS X now.\nI took from my friend an OS X Install DVD and Application Install DVD (he also has a Mac mini). Then I took my PC's external USB DVD drive and connected to Mac mini, inserted the OS X install disk and powered on. During the power on I held the ⌘C button and I saw HDD \"BOOTCAMP\" and CD \"OS X INSTALL\" so I selected the CD but after that I only see the gray screen with an Apple logo.\nHow can I install OS X again on my Mac?\n\nA: Try Internet Recovery. Boot with ⌘⌥R until you get a spinning globe, then follow the instructions.\nYou'll need to have been fully up-to-date with Firmware updates though.\n", "Q: E-Mail on iPad and E-Mail on Computer not connected I have my Hotmail account setup on my iPad and everything is working. However whenever I go to my computer and login to my Hotmail account all messages are unread even though I read them on my iPad. This never happened before. How can I fix it?\n\nA: Hotmail uses the POP protocol. This protocol only allows to download mails from the server. Therefore it does not sync mail for example to mark them as read. \nIf you want to fix this you have to configure your Hotmail account to uses the IMAP protocol which allows the synchronising... But this is really tricky to do.  : \n\n\n*\n\n*If it's not done : Migrate your Hotmail account to Outlook.com\n\n*On the iDevice : Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar > Other\n\n*Add Mail account \n\n*Add a fake mail account (if iOS detecte a @hotmail.com, @live.com or @outlook.com it will suppose it is POP only) \n\n*You'll get an error (normal, you added a fake account) \n\n*After this you'll have 2 tabs : IMAP and POP, file the IMAP tab with the following infos : \n\n*\n\n*Incoming mail server :\n\n*\n\n*Host Name : imap-mail.outlook.com\n\n*Port : 993\n\n*SSL : yes\n\n\n*Serveur sortant :\n\n*\n\n*Host name : smtp-mail.outlook.com\n\n*Port : 587\n\n*TLS : yes\n\n\n\n", "Q: Employing a second medium of sound volume resistance? I have a Macbook Pro 2012 and a pair of headphones (without their own sound volume adjuster). These headphones are awfully loud and even with quarter bar sound level, I have to turn the audio volume slider in apps all the way down to get a decent volume level. My ears aren't super sensitive or anything, I think it's just these headphones.\nIs there a software that I can download which will act as a virtual cable type thing where the app will feed audio data to the virtual cable (VC), the VC will then allow me to edit the sound (in my case I want to alter volume levels) and then output to my headphones.\nThis isn't something that you can do in the default Mac OS (I don't think so anyhow). I'm asking if anyone has heard of something like that.\n\nA: There is actually a somewhat hidden step between 1/4 bars and muted. To select it, first set the volume to zero by holding the volume down key and then press the mute key.\nAnother way is to run osascript -e 'set volume output volume 0.5'. set volume output volume 0.1 and set volume output volume 0.9 are equivalent to set volume output volume 0.5.\nYou can decrease the volume level by using Soundflower together with AU Lab:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Soundflower from http://cycling74.com/soundflower-landing-page/ and download AU Lab from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/.\n\n*Select Soundflower (2ch) from System Preferences > Sound > Output.\n\n*Open AU Lab, set the input device to Soundflower (2ch), set the output device to Built-in Output, and press Create Document.

In fact COMMAND-OPTION-F brings up the search tab with the focus on the find field where you can type your query in.\nSince this is so easy to find I can only conclude that you are looking for something more than that?\nBTW, I just remembered that Outlook uses Spotlight to do it's searches, so you could do your search there and add criteria to the searches you need and save the searches as smart folders.\n", "Q: Logitech x-240 Sound System not functioning with MacBook Pro When I plug the Logitech x-240 Sound System into the headphone jack of the MacBook Pro, the external speakers continue to play.

During this time xcodebuild seems to be running:\n\nWhere would this hook be that's causing the xcodebuild to be fired? I couldn't find anything in my .zshrc.\n\nA: According to this blog zsh reads a whole bunch of files on startup (including .profile):\n\nSo make sure to check all of them (and also any additional files sourced/called from there).\n\nA: The problem is that the Xcode license hasn't been accepted so when running git it tries to prompt you for accepting the license. For me running\nsudo xcodebuild -license accept\n\nfixed the issue\n\nA: In my case, the problem had something to do with Apple's version of Git. I'm using zsh and include the current git branch in my command line, so git runs every time a new command prompt is generated. When I switched over to using Homebrew's version of Git\nbrew install git\n\nand opened a new terminal, the problem went away.

In iTunes 10, holding the Option key while selecting the Advanced menu turns Create AAC Version into Convert to AAC… which allows selecting a number of files which are then converted to AAC and added to the library. Does this functionality still exist in iTunes 11 (and 12)?\n\nA: It does, but it's a little hard to find. It's under File -> Create New Version. You still need to hold the Option key. But the difference in iTunes 11 (and 12) is that you have to make sure no songs are selected when you perform the menu selection. If a song is selected iTunes will attempt to create an AAC version of the selected song. If nothing is selected you can select audio files to convert to AAC.\n\nA: In iTunes 12, \"Create AAC Version\" is just right under File --> Convert, as shown below.\n\nMake sure setting Import using to AAC Encoder.\niTunes --> Preferences --> General --> Import Settings --> Import using: AAC Encoder.\n\n", "Q: How can I resize my Mac boot partition? I am having some problems using Disk Utility. \nI am trying to combine all my partitions in to one (as it used to be), so that no space will be left unallocated. The problem is though my Recovery HD, it won't let me, it isn't letting me to do so. I can't increase my Mac HDD, but I can easily increase my Recovery HD.\n\nI don't how my Recovery HD is visible, that is a big mystery. \nHow can I get it as it used to be?\n\nA: iPartition\nFor all my partitioning, I use and recommend iPartition. It will allow you to resize partitions without deleting any data. It will automatically move partitions if necessary to allow resizing into free space that is located after a second partition.\n\nWith iPartition, resizing a partition is as simple as selecting it, grabbing the resize handle and dragging. Not only that, but if you have several operations to perform, iPartition lets you queue them up and run them one after another, so you can have a cup of coffee while iPartition works. This feature, coupled with iPartition’s ability to automatically rearrange your existing partitions when necessary, makes iPartition the easiest partitioning tool that you’ll ever use.\n\n\n\nA: Using Disk Utility tool\nThe primary partition can only be resized when all the other partitions - if existing - is deleted.\nTake a backup of the existing non-primary partition is highly suggested as all the data on those existing partitions will be lost.\nsummarily - \n1.

When I wanted to watch it, I attempted to download it first.  I went into the Videos app on the iPhone, and selected TV Series where it was listed, along with the other 2 episodes in Series 1.  Selecting the name of the episode I owned started to stream it, but I wanted to download it instead.  Nowhere could I find the download button.  Hitting Read More under the episode description didn't help, and I eventually gave up.\nSo next I thought I would view my purchase history in the iTunes store, and select it from the list of videos Not on This iPhone, which should be short, as I've only ever bought a couple of videos.  Sadly, hitting the Purchased link doesn't take you to a list like this like it does on the App Store, instead it flips you out of the iTunes Store and into the Music App, and shows me the Purchased Playlist.\nA bit odd that the App and iTunes stores behave differently, think I, but no matter.  However this list is empty.  I select < Playlists to view all playlists, and there are 2 that are named Purchased (and no others, I don't use that feature at all).  Checking both reveals that both are empty.  There is a clear button, but I am certain I have never used it.  I purchased the remainder of the series at this point, so see if it showed up in either of these playlists; it didn't.\n[Edit: I have since discovered that the above behaviour applies when choosing More > Downloads > Purchased in the iTunes Store, I totally missed the separate More > Purchased item further down the menu that behaves as I would expect - still odd that they do different things and one doesn't work at all though]\nSo, I then turn to hitting the iTunes Store directly and manually searching for the episode in order to download it, which works but is cumbersome and relies on me remembering exactly what I am looking for - if I had a larger past purchase history I imagine this could be a pain, or if for example I was part way through a series with a large number of episodes and wasn't sure exactly which I was up to etc.\nAnyway, I downloaded 1 episode, and started to download another, then headed back to the videos app to watch the first and behold, there is an icon showing the download progress for the 2nd episode.  Checking on my iPad shows that on this device to the right of an each episode I get the standard download icon, but it's missing on the iPhone totally, and I hadn't even noticed it was missing.\n\nWhen the download completed, the icon disappeared.  I can watch any of the 3 episodes shown in the screenshot, but although the first 2 are now downloaded and the 3rd streams, there is no way to know which is which, the only clue being an initial delay in buffering contents when streaming.  (I have since watched the first episode, and even the unwatched/watched/part watched icon is missing, but the 2nd and 3rd episodes both show an unwatched icon, but no indication that 1 is downloaded and the other is not - this page now looks exactly like the screenshot, only without the download progress icon)\nFurther Info: Since posting the above, I played some more.  In the movies section of the app, when I select a movie I get the choice to play and a download icon too.  For music videos, I get a list just like with TV programs without the download button.  However, when I start to stream one, then exit out, I don't return to the same screen, but instead am shown one that looks more like the movies screen layout and the download button appears!?\nSo, question time! What's going on with the download icon and indication whether it's going to play or stream when viewing my purchased items directly in the Video app, why does the iPad show it but the iPhone does not?  And why are my purchased playlists empty when in the Music app?\nIf nothing else, can anyone with an iPhone 4 try to replicate this problem, to see if it's just me, or if it's a replicable issue for anyone with my combination of HW/SW?\n\nA: Hmm, good question!\nIn my experience, this has happened many times. It is possible it is because of not enough space, or it would take a lot of space, causing this reaction to take an extremly slow time to download. Also, it might not appear because you leave it as it is taking its time to load, possible being a reload of page you are on.\n", "Q: Why is Chrome getting so slow when file vault is enabled? I recently enabled file vault to encrypt my disk but now Google Chrome is really slow and it seems to be related to the file vault. The slowness is in anything and everything I do in chrome: opening a new tab, opening a link or a bookmark, even switching to a different gmail inbox tab is slow. I've already changed my new tab page to be blank, which helped a little but it is still very slow.\nMy suspicion is that it is related to file vault encrypting Chrome cache. Is there a way to work around that? \n\nA: I've solved this problem by moving my Chrome cache outside of my home folder as follows:\nClosed chrome. Then in Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd Library/Application\\ Support\n\n*sudo mkdir -p /local/myusername/\n\n*sudo chown myusername:_lpoperator /local/myusername/\n\n*mv Google /local/myusername/\n\n*ln -s /local/myusername/Google\nUpdate: I'm not entirely clear why this speeds things up again, since, as was noted in the comments, File Vault 2 actually does encrypt the entire disk, not just the home folder.

I have a 2.5\" SSD (Crucial CT480M500SSD1) that I want to use as my boot drive on my mid-2010 8-core Mac Pro. It doesn't fit the hard drive mounting brackets, which are designed for 3.5\" drives. Because the SSD (a) is very light and (b) has no moving parts (and therefore no gyroscopic effects and no vibration), I'm considering mounting it without using a bracket at all—just plugging in straight into the socket, and letting the socket hold it in place. Is this reasonably safe?\n\nA: If you plan on \"plugging in straight into the socket\" that would be a very bad idea. The SSD is light, but all of that weight will now be supported entirely by the two SATA sockets on the computer and drive. Over time the small amount of weight on the SSD will brake the bracket on the Mac Pro (expensive), or worse the drive (data loss).\nIf you can find the correct cable you could run a cable from the socket to the hard drive, and double stick tape the drive like the above answer said.\nOr just buy a 3.5 to 2.5 adapter and install it in the drive carrier. It is cheaper than repair.\n\nA: In my opinion it is reasonably safe. I would do it under your circumstances. However, my caveat to this is if you move your computer at all do something to secure the drive.\nOne more thing to consider: using some double-sided tape to stick the drive to the mounting area. I did this in my iMac when I added an SSD for a home-built Fusion drive.\n", "Q: Durability of plastic screen on latest Retina Macbook Pro? I am in need of a new MBP. I do development (Ruby/Rails) on my mid 2009 13\" MBP running Mavericks, and I find it is getting old enough that I'm getting some lag when I'm running DB and web server, Rubymine, browsers, etc. all at once. I would buy the latest 13\" MBP today, as I don't need more than the 8GB/256GB setup. My issue is the screen itself. I LOVE the glossy screens, but I went to the Apple Store and touched the screen on a new RMBP. The LCD distorted as it flexed. Apparently these are plastic screens? A while back I was looking at a friend's MacBook Air. I didn't realize the screens were plastic, no glass like my older MBP. I get why they are using plastic, but it seemed like he had to use a screen protector on his MBA because oil from the tips of his fingers would collect on the keys, and the keys would touch the screen when it was closed. This happened on my old Pismo Powerbook and my 12\" PowerBook. The oil actually attacks the plastic and mars it permanently. \nMy question is for current MBP owners, Have you experienced any transfer of dirt and oil from the keys to the screen? I noticed at the store that the screen is inset from the gasket around the edge, so it seems like it SHOULDN'T touch. But being plastic it is much more likely to flex. Also has anyone seen scratches even when cleaning carefully with microfiber and an approved cleaning liquid?\nI would buy the Non-Retina 13\" MBP in a heartbeat, and just replace the optical and HDD with a couple SSDs, if it was running the Haswell processor that the RBMP has. I don't care so much about the resolution, but more about the processor already being \"previous gen\". Can't seem to find any signs if they plan on updating the Non-retina models with the latest processors. \nThoughts and experiences?\n\nA: From someone who has the 13 inch MBPr, I have some comments about the screen.\nPros:\n-incredibly sharp\n-Fantastic colors and contrast\n-Very bright\nCons:\n-The glass- let me explain. Initially I notice that the glass did not seem particularly durable but, decided to get in anyways seeing as I wanted something new and powerful. My suspicion was correct. My screen has a huge scape across the center due to what i can only assume is the keyboard. I also have tons of those small chips/divots/dents (whatever you want to call them) all over the top half of my screen. I am not the person to mistreat their electronics. I always handle them with care and constantly clean and disinfect them. So it was a bit of a surprise to me when all of this damage occurred to the screen. Apple definitely made a mistake with this one. I am yet to go and get it checked out but judging by other reports i have doubts they will be willing to replace it.\n\nA: It's glass and it is just as durable. \nSince they removed a layer between the glass and the actual display, it's thiner\nAnd the glass is closer to the display. \nEvery screen has this effect. You just need to press harder ;)\nFingerprints are less of an issue than on my\nold non-retina MBP imho\n\nA: I have the late 2013 rMBP.\nAdvice:\nBuy a can of air and a microfiber cloth at Walmart\nAnd all is good.  Static is bad on the display which will attract tiny dust occasionally.\nBetween the 2 mentioned items you will be fine.\nAnd yes, it takes almost NO pressure to cause the LCD to distort from your finger. I was a little let down on this.  Mainly because you have this terribly tough aluminum casing, but a display that's as soft as butter, BIZARRE!\nFingerprints?? NOT an issue even after closing the lid.\nBUT!\nThe keys as usual look like crap after some good usage.  I wonder, why oh why does Apple use a material that makes finger prints stand out on the keys!  Some people have greasy greasy oily fingers, something I don't have but yet STILL have those fingerprints!\nThankfully the rubber seal/gasket keeps the display from resting on the keyboard.\nOne more negative about the keyboard...feels cheap...feels like you are using very thing plastic keys, as you press each down against the hard aluminum, they are about to pop off. \nIf I turn the keyboard brightness all the way up, and turn off the lights in my room, and lean back a little for a level viewing angle, I can see that my space bar is actually bent! Looks like crap to be honest and plan to visit a Genius Bar soon...\nBattery life is crazy good!  I won't give numbers because everyone's habits are different, but its nothing short of amazing!\nWith the 256 gigs of SSD FLASH (PCIE), and the 8 gigs ram, it's FAST and somewhat future proofed.

Automatic backups don't occur, and I periodically get the \"your iPhone has not been backed up in n weeks\" message. Manual backups fail silently.\nI used Xcode to look at the iPhone's console while running a manual backup, and I saw this message:\nbackupd[26422] <Warning>: WARNING: MobileKeyBag: _MKBBackupCheckKey: corrupt key; blob size 100, header+key size 2964429488\nbackupd[26422] <Warning>: WARNING: Failed to validate encryption key (protection class changed?): /var/mobile/Applications/EDED6B41-0E2A-4705-9E20-21223266C7CF/Library/googleanalytics.sql (acdcbfc20cba94afaf0d751d3cf039d68046bed5)\nbackupd[26422] <Warning>: WARNING: MobileKeyBag: MKBBackupCopyKey: Failed to rewrap\nbackupd[26422] <Warning>: INFO: Not retrying after unrecoverable error: Missing encryption key for file (MBErrorDomain/209)\nbackupd[26422] <Warning>: ERROR: Backup failed: Missing encryption key for file (MBErrorDomain/209)\n\nSo there is a specific file for a specific app which makes the entire backup fail. This matches one of the folk remedies suggested in the numerous threads on this issue in support forums: disable backing up all apps, then do a binary search to find out which one causes the backup to fail.\nI thought it would be better to find a simpler solution. I couldn't figure out which app corresponds to that path in the filesystem, but the \"Failed to validate encryption key (protection class changed?)\" made me think that perhaps deleting the existing backup (from the iOS 6 days) might make things work again.\nIt actually made things worse: now I get a few screens' worth of messages like these:\nbackupd[26468] <Warning>: WARNING: MobileKeyBag: MKBBackupCopyKey: Failed to rewrap\nbackupd[26468] <Warning>: INFO: Encryption key not found for protected file: /var/mobile/Applications/68655AB4-A485-47BF-9E57-CA5BA6EB08C4/Documents/Inbox/request-8.mkdirectionsrequest (5ad7be5ccbc7c8ae2f7a0fee2a5e21bb590e2568)\n\nI tried googling the error messages, but nothing useful turned out. That surprised me: obviously lots of people are having problems with iCloud backup, judging by all the support threads, but nobody thought to look at the logs?\nHopefully this can become the place where we actually find a solution.\n\nA: My iPad had the same problem in November.  The only way I was able to fix it was to delete the most resent iCloud backup(s) from/for the troubled device until it I could complete a manual iCloud back.  As a precaution create a local back up on your computer before deleting iCloud backups(s). \n\nA: The error messages shows the location of apps with the 'bad file':\n/var/mobile/Applications/EDED6B41-0E2A-4705-9E20-21223266C7CF/\n\n/var/mobile/Applications/68655AB4-A485-47BF-9E57-CA5BA6EB08C4/\n\nYou could use an app such as iExplorer to browse to this location and determine which app it is.\n\nWithout jailbreaking your device, you will still have read/write access to the Media (\"/var/mobile/Media/\") and Apps (\"/var/mobile/Applications\") directories in iExplorer.\n\nSource: Access the iPhone root (\"/\") directory\nOnce you know the app, you can delete it.\n\nA: You could back up your iPhone or any other device onto an external hd then pay a visit to the Genius Bar or chat with them using the online Apple service.

If I am using a laptop in clamshell mode, and then I unplug the screen and disconnect the power without opening up the laptop, will it automatically go to sleep or will it stay turned on?\n\nA: Testing this just now on my personal rMBP, it does not go to sleep immediately. It appears to trigger the sleep at the normal \"power adapter sleep\" time.a\n\nA: Under Settings > Energy Saver, you can dictate how it behaves while on battery or while plugged in.\nIf the Battery sleep setting is set to a particular timespan, it will sleep after that amount of inactivity. If set to \"Never\", then it will stay on until the battery gets low enough that the safe-sleep mode kicks in.\n", "Q: Lock screen audio I'd like to allow audio to keep working when the screen lock is activated.

On one of the drop down menus (I recommend the lower left), select Put Display to Sleep. To lock the screen you now just have to place the mouse in the corner you designated, but the time it takes for the lock to engage is determined in the Security and Privacy panel of System Preferences > General. Now when your screen is locked music/audio will continue to play (including Airplay music streaming), also downloads will continue, etc., but a password will be required to turn your screen back on.\n", "Q: Disk needs repaired... but it doesn't?

DW may be your only choice.\nI would contact Alsoft about your issue, probably just link back to this thread so they can see the exact error. \nI have never used DW on a volume with FileVault and am not sure of it's efficacy so check with them first, unless someone here can tell me I either am or am not full of little red ants...\n\nA: The filesystem on your OS X disk has developed some errors.  You've checked the filesystem using disk utility, but you cannot repair a running disk, as the greyed out button indicates.  You've rebooted into recovery mode (booting from the recovery partition with Cmd-R, leaving your main OS partition unmounted) so you can repair your corrupted filesystem now.  However, because your filesystem is encrypted using FileVault, it appears to the disk utility in recovery mode as a single file--a large encrypted disk image.  Checking the volume appears impossibly fast, and it always returns zero (0), indicating a clean filesystem check.  If you want to check the filesystem inside the encrypted disk image, you first need to unlock it from the disk utility file menu.  After typing a password to unlock the image, you can check it normally.  It will take a longer time, but a lot less time than turning FileVault off and back on again.\n", "Q: Upon boot up why is there usage in Inactive and Page In for memory? \nI understand the concept behind the various memory usage, but I don't understand why there are Inactive memory and Page In upon boot up.  There are no applications that have started which hasn't quit, and what was in RAM that was written to HD that is being brought back as shown in Page In?\n\nA: The Inactive memory is probably the result of the boot process itself. Any of the files the boot process used, and then no longer needed are still cached for retrieval until something else needs the space.\nI believe the page-outs have to do with the way OS X handles loading of dynamically linked libraries and files. Say you load an app called ReallyComplexApplication. This may point to a number of different libraries of code, but don't all need to be loaded into RAM when the app first loads. So OS X loads the core program into memory, and sets up RAM in such a way that if ReallyComplexApplication tries to grab code or data from BigLibraryOfCode it is automatically loaded from disk to memory.\nThat would be a page in. The OS expects data to be in RAM, but it isn't really there. This isn't really a problem, per say, because it is designed that way. But it is still considered a \"page fault\"\n[EDIT]\nSource: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/AboutMemory.html\nIn that article they actually differentiate, so what you're probably seeing is what they call \"Soft fault.\"\nOn my machine that has been up for 2 days, I have 16GB of RAM, 0 page-outs but 22,288,514 page ins.\n", "Q: Will Keynote Remote work with a MacBook in closed clamshell mode? For my next presentation, I plan to use Keynote Remote so I can control a Keynote presentation with my iPhone. Will this work while the MacBook Air is in 'closed clamshell' mode?

I'm looking to connect my iPhone 5 to my iPad Mini to upload pictures taken from my iPhone 5. What adapters and/or cables are needed?\n\nUpdate: According to this article, it is possible. Has something changed in the iOS to not allow this?\n\nA: A wireless recommendation would be to use iCloud to sync the photos between the devices. Just go to Settings > iCloud > Photos and turn on Photo Stream. After this, all new photos will be synced to the cloud and back to all devices that use the same iCloud account.\nYou could also install Dropbox and sync the photos from there. Or use Flicr.\n\nA: You can use a Lightning to USB camera adapter.

In linux in CLI I can press ALT + F or ALT + B to move back and forth in terms of words and not one character at a time.\nIs this available in Mac?\nThere is no ALT and I tried Control + F, Fn + F, Command + F  but it does not work.\nBTW I am using the default console installed.\n\nA: There are a number of ways to skin this cat.\nFirstly, there is an ALT key, but depending on the age of your Mac/keyboard is may be called Option or look like ⌥.  Using ALT+◀︎ or ▶︎ will move a word at a time using a default shell in the default terminal app.\nSecondly, you can tell your shell of choice to use alternate methods.  If you have ever used vi and are used to its weird methods of navigation w to move forward a word, b to go back,W to move forward a sentence and so on, then you can tell it to use those instead by typing set -o vi into your shell, now the first method doesn't work, and the weirdy vi method is used instead.\nIn addition, in Settings > Settings > Keyboard (on Mavericks at least) you can tick this little fella to bring back your ALT+F behaviour:\n\nThere are probably way more methods too, it depends on your shell and your shell options basically.\n", "Q: Is the iPhone 5s Voice over LTE (VoLTE) capable?

This occasionally moves but in 10.9 it is in /private/var/db/receipts.\nIf we installed our mpkg file recently then it is best to use find like so:\nfind /private/var/db/receipts -ctime 2\n\nwhich will list all the receipt files changed in the last two days. The files found will have names that look like \"com.company.application.bom\" or they also end in \".plist\". The file name without the .bom or .plist is a package ID.\nNow we know a package ID we can ask pkgutil to list all the files installed and their location.\npkgutil --files com.company.application\n\nThis will produce a long list of all the files installed and where they are located.\nYou may see some who recommend methods using the folder /Library/Receipts but not all receipts are actually stored in there for some reason.\n\nA: You can press command-I in an installer window to list the files that would be copied by the installer:\n\nIf the mpkg file is a bundle that contains pkg files, you can use lsbom:\n$ lsbom /Volumes/TrueCrypt\\ 7.1a/TrueCrypt\\ 7.1a.mpkg/Contents/Packages/TrueCrypt.pkg/Contents/Archive.bom\n.   40755   0/0\n./TrueCrypt.app 40775   0/80\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents    40775   0/80\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents/Info.plist 100664  0/80    934 2986627536\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents/MacOS  40775   0/80\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents/MacOS/TrueCrypt    100775  0/80    10941620    3857709971\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents/PkgInfo    100664  0/80    12  2672927831\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents/Resources  40775   0/80\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents/Resources/License MacFUSE.rtf  100664  0/80    13023   2006089031\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents/Resources/License OSXFUSE.rtf  100664  0/80    19096   2055725362\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents/Resources/License.txt  100664  0/80    24018   2573692796\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents/Resources/TrueCrypt User Guide.pdf 100664  0/80    923969  902212473\n./TrueCrypt.app/Contents/Resources/TrueCrypt.icns   100664  0/80    60982   1040643878\n\npkgutil --bom works with some non-bundle pkg files:\nlsbom $(pkgutil --bom file.pkg)\n\nOr use lsbom after you have installed the package:\nlsbom /var/db/receipts/com.tapbots.TweetbotMac.bom\n\n\nA: Use opensnoop\nNext time before running the .mpkg file you could run opensnoop from the command line and that will tell you exactly what files are being modified, opened and created.\n", "Q: toggle playPause for iPhoto, script problem, probably global variable I need toggle playPause for iPhoto, so I wrote this script\nglobal isPaused\ntry\n    get isPaused\non error\n    set isPaused to false\nend try\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\n    if slideshow running then\n        if isPaused then\n            resume slideshow\n        else\n            pause slideshow\n            set isPaused to true\n        end if\n    else\n        start slideshow\n    end if\nend tell\n\nI sent this command via ssh (with osascript -e '%s') and resume feature doesn't work (start and pause work correctly).\nso I wrote helper script\ntry\n    get toggle\non error\n    set toggle to false\nend try\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\n    if toggle then\n        start slideshow\n    else\n        set toggle to true\n    end if\nend tell\n\nit works correctly when I run it via AppleScript editor, but not if I run this code via ssh.\n[edited]\nI run scripts exactly this way:\nosascript -e 'try\nget toggle\non error\nset toggle to false\nend try\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\nif toggle then\nstart slideshow\nelse\nset toggle to true\nend if\nend tell'\n\n\nA: I solved my problem, global variable was reset, now I store variable in file, here is the code:\nset thePath to (get path to scripts folder from user domain as text) & “myTempFile.scpt\"\n\nscript theData\n    property IsPaused : missing value\nend script\n\ntry\n    set theData to load script file thePath\non error\n    set IsPaused of theData to false\nend try\n\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\n    if slideshow running then\n        if isPaused of theData then\n            resume slideshow\n        set isPaused of theData to false\n        else\n            pause slideshow\n            set isPaused of theData to true\n        end if\n    else\n        start slideshow\n    set isPaused of theData to false\n    end if\nend tell\n\nstore script theData in file thePath replacing yes\nreturn IsPaused of theData\n\n", "Q: Whole disk encryption with a Windows only Bootcamp I've purchased myself a Mac Book Pro Retina (Haswell) and after giving Mac OS a fair shake have decided to go full Windows 7 and Bootcamp.

I can't find anywhere in garageband to change it to mono after the fact.  Is this possible?  \nPanning the guitar track to the right silences the track, but if it's panned all the way to the left it's full.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This was driving me mad, but I now use an very smooth way based on JHerran's answer. It has the virtue of only requiring Garageband and is quick.\nN.B. I assume your track has a single region: if not you will have to shift-click to select all the regions in the track that you want to convert.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the track that you want to convert. The single region should automatically be highlighted.\n\n*Command-D or >Track>New Track with duplicate settings to create a new track\n\n*Command-V to paste the original regions to the new track\n\n*Shift-Click on the original region(s) to highlight it again\n\n*Command-J to join the regions, select \"Mono\" for the mix-down\n\n*The mix-down will replace the original stereo track - you can now click on the temporary track and Delete it.\n\n\nA: There's a command line approach to this that, once you get it all set up, is a little more straightforward.\nFirst you need to install Homebrew, the best package manager for OS X out there. Open up Terminal and type:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nWith Homebrew installed you can install all kinds of cool command line tools using the brew command. We're going to use it to install sox, \"the Swiss Army knife of sound processing programs\":\nbrew install sox\n\nWith sox installed we can split our audio file in to two mono tracks with one simple command call. First, from GarageBand, export your stereo track to disk as a wav file. With the file on disk, open up a Terminal program and change to the location:\ncd ~/Music/GarageBand/bounces/\n\nAnd then run this sox to command to split the file in to two mono tracks, one for the left channel and another for the right channel:\nsox My\\ Song.wav My\\ Song.L.wav remix 1\nsox My\\ Song.wav My\\ Song.R.wav remix 2\n\nsox will keep the WAV settings the same as the source material so you should be able to, quite easily, drag and drop these split files back in to GarageBand as mono tracks.\n\nA: 2017: it’s in the Track controls (where the sends and reverb and stuff are, double-click on the track header) next to where it says “No Input” (or possibly input, depending on what you have set up). There are two intersecting circles. Click that and it becomes one circle. This works even AFTER recording, I just checked. Hope this helps!\nI made a little illustration because this took me WAY too long to find just now, even with the help of this thread.  There are too many things in garageband that are buttons that do not look like buttons. \n\n\n\n\nA: Another really simple option (if you have a spare Plugin slot free) is to apply the \"Gain\" plugin set to Mono.\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the track you want to convert to activate it\n\n*Open the Track Controls (that's the one where you can see the knobs for Compressor, EQ etc)\n\n*Scroll that bottom window down (on the left-hand side) and you'll find the \"Plug-in\" section.\n\n*Choose a plugin you're not using (it will be black or empty) and click on the little up/down arrows next to that plugin to select a new plugin to replace it\n\n*Go to Utility > Gain\n\n*Now click again on that plugin slot, but in the middle this time to open the Plugin controls\n\n*Using the pull-down menu on the Gain plugin control, choose \"Convert to Mono\"\n\n*You should be good to go!\n\nIf you DON'T have a plugin spot you can spare (if you're using all 4) then use the accepted answer to bounce your track down to mono.\n\n\nA: Found the answer here\n\nPan the GarageBand track to one side, and export to iTunes via the Share menu. Next, in iTunes, set iTunes' importing preference to the format you want, and mono, Select the song in iTunes and choose the \"Create [format] Version\" menuItem from the advanced menu. Repeat the steps panning the other way if you want the other channel as a mono file as well.\n\n\nA: I found an easy way,  \n\n\n*\n\n*Record your stereo track (the one that can only can pan to one side).\n\n*Record another track but set all the controls to the minimum levels (Gain, track volume, etc.) the track can be recorded with silence.\n\n*Select both passages and join them  (⌘ + J) GB will show and option to join the tracks in mono!\n\n\nA: Select the track. Go to edit (click the i in the bottom right to open all the effects and such). On the bottom where it says \"Input Source\" change to Mono.\n\nA: Here is a quick way in GarageBand.\nSpecifically, I needed to create a stereo track out of a mono/video track.\nDragging or importing the track into GarageBand did not allow the track to pan. But,  by creating an audio/vocal track in GB, then dragging my mono/video track into that lane, it allowed some level of panning. So, I duplicated my first track, to add even more stereo simulation by lessening the more dominant track to balance out the weak one. It’s mono by making stereo; maybe?\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: I find Tom Auger's suggestion of using the Gain plug-in to convert to mono the cleanest and simplest method. After doing this I export the track and then re-import it to make sure its mono status is baked in and that it looks like a mono track as you work with it.\n\nA: otherwise, for older GB version : export the track to audio; load it into the audacity free software, there go into the Track menu, then -> Stereo to mono.\nNow File -> Export audio ... choose AIFF (Apple...) save it on your desktop.\nNow drag the icon on you desktop to an empty GB track that will be mono then  =no more problem.\n\nA: download Tipard All Music Converter and when exporting the original stereo file select settings and choose mono. This will blend whatever is on the R & L sides into the same output on each sides of the new file.\n", "Q: Apps gone missing after rebooting on jailbroken iPad 4 After school, I was doing research on Canadian Blood Service.

So far, i've created an application that runs at user login that gathers all the items from trash and from a folder that I use for ARD installs and securely deletes them.  \nI'd love to make this task run at logout and would like to know how to set that up.  Logout hook?\nNext, on my OSX server, I have a folder where PDFs are sent to from my iPads.  I need to take those PDFs, watermark them, and move them to another folder.  I have an automator action that will do this, but i'm having trouble getting it setup to run in the background WITHOUT anyone logged in to the server.  I've currently got this configured as an application, but it seems like it should be a folder action, but I can't figure out where to specify the folder action for the folder action automator type.  Also, how to get it to run on the server w/o anyone logged in?\n\nA: Automator requires a graphical user session to run within. Regrettably, Automator can not run without a user session; this is because it is an application rather than a command line process.\nBecause of this requirement, running an Automator workflow at log-out is difficult. You need to run the workflow and delay the requested log-out until the workflow finishes.\nIf the tasks could be performed from a shell script, then this would be easier to hook into the log in and out steps.\n\nA: How about this?\n\n\n*\n\n*setup automatic login so that automator get it's required graphical user session \n\n*create an application workflow to launch the screensaver or force jump back to the login screen (effectively locking the screen and allowing others to use the computer).\n\n*Add your application workflow to the automatic user's login items.\n\n\nSee here for command line to start the screen saver, or lock the session by going back to the login window as shown here. \n", "Q: Text editor - float above other windows I'm looking for a text editor with the ability to float above other windows. As far as I know, Sublime and the native TextEdit don't have this feature. Is there some other program that does have this feature?\n\nA: Stickies!\nThe OS X version of this app that's been on Macs since System 7.5 has the ability to float, and become semitransparent.\n\nTechnically it's a rich-text notetaking app rather than a plaintext editor, but it might satisfy your use case.\nAnother option (quite the polar opposite of Stickies) would be to use an editor within Terminal, and use TotalTerminal to display it in \"visor\" mode.\nFinally, it looks like there was an open-source project that added these kinds of window management features to any app of your choosing called Afloat.

If you then paste into the Terminal you will get the entire path, unfortunately most other apps you will just get the filename.\n\nIf you want the full path then you can create an Automator Service to do it easily :-\n\nCreate a new Automator service and change the 'Service receives Selected' to : Files or folders  And the in  to the Finder application.\nAdd a Copy to Clipboard Action and Save the Service.\nYou can now select a file, right click to get a contextual menu and select your service in the Service submenu.\nThe path will be in the clipboard ready for you to paste. You can even set a keyboard shortcut for it if you like.\nOriginally I used a Run Applescript Action to get the Posix path to the file and pass it on to the Copy to Clipboard Action.\nBut I discovered all you needed is to have the selection passed directly to the Copy to Clipboard Action. \nThis improved on the Applescript because the Applescript could only deal with one item being selected as written.\nBut now you can select multiple files and get multiple paths in the clipboard without writing any code.\n\nA: You can assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"Finder\" to set s to selection as alias list\nif s is {} then return\nset out to \"\"\nrepeat with f in s\n    set out to out & POSIX path of f & linefeed\nend repeat\nset the clipboard to out\n\nThere was a bug in 10.7 and 10.8 that made it difficult to get the selection property reliably, but it was fixed in 10.9.

I am using TotalTerminal. Now, I want to use Go2Shell, so that I can access quickly a terminal in the good folder.\nBut, when I click on the Go2Shell icon, it opens a usual Terminal and not a TotalTerminal shell.\nIs there a way to use TotalTerminal with Go2Shell or to open in TotalTerminal a shell set to the current directory?\n\nEDIT\nThe first shell that I open with Go2Shell opens in the Visor of TotalTerminal.

Lots of caveats, a few instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*[Some of this can be changed by editing the script(s) — open the program in Automator.]  \n\n*⌘-drag into Finder toolbar to \"install\".\n\n*You must have TotalTerminal open (i.e., the menu bar icon) prior to using this.\n\n*You will need to \"enable access for Assistive Devices\" (<=10.8), or authorize \"System Events\" in Security/Accessibility pane (10.9). It will prompt you.\n\n*Your Visor trigger must be ⌘ /\n\n*Your default profile must be 'Visor'. \n\n*Your startup action must be \"new window with settings: Visor\".\n\n*It doesn't work 100% like Go2Shell, as something in Finder must be selected — if it seems to not be working, make sure you've clicked something. Mostly only affects icon view.\n\n*Probably a couple other things I'm forgetting. If you decide to use this and can't get it to work, let me know.

But its also limited in a lot of ways. How can I do [this/that/the other]?\n\n(I'm venturing that is basically the case since I found myself in that same situation not all that long ago.)\n\nSo, probably a better answer:\n(In my own opinion and experience.)\nSimply by virtue of the fact that you're asking these questions, and its important enough to you to post a bounty, I think It's probably time to upgrade to a more powerful terminal emulator. You might have looked at iTerm before, perhaps found its configuration/preferences to be cumbersome, and yes, that's not one of its strongest points. But once you overcome that, it makes up for it manyfold in power and flexibility. It's absolutely worth investing the time to figure it out, since it can do what you're asking now, and probably what's you'll be asking next as well.\nJust a couple examples:  \n\n\n*\n\n*multiple system-wide hotkeys for flexible \"visors\", with customizable settings for each.\n\n*Recursive split panes, as well as tabs.\n\n*Go2Shell supports it fine: open -a Go2Shell --args config, select iTerm2.\n\n*Doesn't require hacking Terminal.app by injecting code.\n\n*Lots more (look under the help menu).\n\n\nQuick and dirty demo (animated gif, click to expand):\n\n \nIf anyone is wondering what magic they're seeing here:  \nThat's iTerm (with a profile with a system hotkey), the Solarized theme, fish, and vimpager.\n\nHopefully, you'll find something that works well for your workflow: if not, keep looking.  \nMore or less, someone's always already done it — you just have to find it!\n", "Q: How can I create 'gch.app' such that \"open -a gch page.html\" works like \"open -a Google\\ Chrome page.html\"?

I'm currently studying abroad in England. I have an iPod touch, iPhone 5, and Macbook Air. I recently took the SIM card out of my iPhone and received a UK Sim card so I can use data and texting here in London. However, I obviously got a new phone number  with that. I was fine with having a new phone number and simply using iMessage on my laptop or iPod touch seeing as all my friends from home have that. However, my US messages are not working now that my iPhone is associated with a new number.

Also, my computer's wifi works fine. (I'm connecting with my phone to the hotspot and my computer is connected using the phone's wifi, so I'm sure both work.)\nI'm pretty sure the computer (or hotspot) just thinks they already know each other, so it's not redirecting to the agreement.

At that point, it failed with the even more helpful “support files could not be installed”.  That’s it; it didn’t bother to tell me which support files, just that they couldn’t be installed.  When I tried again, it went back to “ERROR_DOWNLOAD_FAILED”.  I turned the network adapter back on, and failed the same way.\nI’m using the default install options, which should require a little under 12GB, and the VM’s HD has 43GB available.  The machine I’m running the VM on is a MacBook Pro (i7) running OS X 10.8.\nAny insights are appreciated!\nEDIT: see my answer below for the resolution, which required two steps.\n\nA: I found a link that might help: https://communities.vmware.com/thread/457351\nYou have Server, so that should be OK, try ripping it into a disk image (if you haven't already done so) and see if it will work with that instead.\nI only have personal experience with Parallels, so I can't try it myself.\n\nA: In the end, it was a confluence of two things: trying to install from physical media, and CPU incompatibility.  Here’s how I got past it:\nFirst, I created a disk image (.dmg) of the install disc, as per BoxOfSnoo’s answer.  The thread s/he linked to led me to the VMWare Community article Creating a disc image from physical Mac OS X install media, which I used to get me past the “ERROR_DOWNLOAD_FAILED” barrier.\nWith that resolved, however, I immediately ran into the error “The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system.”  Googling that led me to the VMWare KB article Installing OS X Snow Leopard Server on an i5- or i7-based Macbook Pro fails with the error: The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system (1026103), which informed me that OS X 10.6.3—the version that Apple ships you when you order it—is not compatible with i7 (and other) Macs.\nI used the .vmx editing solution shown in that article to mask the CPU, which let me finish the installation.  That done, I ran Software Update in the VM to update to 10.6.8, which can handle i7 (etc.) CPUs.  Then I shut down the VM, removed the CPU-masking line I’d added to the .vmx file, and launched the VM.

I have had random disconnection issues on this (and only this) network. The problem occurs as follows. After some time of working fine (usually an hour or two), I begin being disconnected from the network consistently. I can stay connected for maybe 10 or 20 seconds before being disconnected again. When I am disconnected, the computer gives itself a self-assigned IP address, and maybe a minute later is (sometimes) able to get a new address from the DHCP server. If I manually renew the DHCP lease (sometimes) or if I turn Wi-Fi off and on (almost all the time), it connects again, but only for another 20 seconds. A reboot does not help; it begins the disconnect cycles immediately on boot.\nI've contacted the network support team several times and talked to them in person several more times, but they've been unable (or maybe unwilling) to track down the problem. I want to make sure that there's no problem with my system. I'm suspicious since my iPhone and iPad both have no problems. The laptop, however, has no problems on other networks (ever) so I'm just not sure. The fact that only the laptop is doing it suggests it may be having trouble, but all other networks are fine, which suggests the network is at fault.\nI'm mainly looking for suggestions of what problems could cause this behavior, and where appropriate, solutions (either complete or partial) that might fix them. What techniques can I use to track down the real source of this problem?\n\nA: For starters you could try a simple ping to a popular outside URL, like yahoo.com or google.com, let it run like 10-15 times, maybe more, and see if the connection gets no response in any of the pings. That will show you your connection on that network isn't consistent.\nThere are also various Wi-Fi network optimization settings, so something that benefits them the most in crowded areas may not be working for your machine. If they are testing newer Wi-Fi frequencies, like AC or even some variant of N, you may not be the only person affected with a new MacBook on campus.\n", "Q: Randomize ical event start times I have an event in ical that recurs every day.\nI would like to randomize the start time of this event (which schedules an applescript) so that the start times are random but within 30 min of each other.\nI've done google and duckduck searches for:\n\n\n*\n\n*randomize ical event start time; \n\n*randomize ical events by 5 minutes,\n\n\nand have gotten nothing relevant.\nI've had a look at the applescript dictionary for iCal but cannot find a useful function.\nI don't need the whole script just a hint in the right direction or a function that I could use to create the events instead of modifying them all by hand.\n\nA: I found the answer googling for applescript make start time random.\nI used the following code from this apple support community thread:\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\nlaunch\nrepeat\ndelay (random number from 2 to 8)\nset textToType to \"text\" & some item of {\"hello\", \"goodbye\"} & text\nend repeat\nend tell\n\n\nand for text:\nsome item of {\"blue\", \"red\"}\n\n\nHere is the final script that worked for me:\ntell application \"iCal\"\n\n    set myCal to \"Scheduled tasks\"\n    activate\n    set allEvents to every event in calendar myCal\n    repeat with anEvent in allEvents\n        set modTime to (random number from 0 to 30)\n        display dialog modTime with title start date of anEvent as text\n        set newStartTime to (start date of anEvent) + modTime * minutes\n        set start date of anEvent to newStartTime\n        set (end date of anEvent) to ((end date of anEvent) + modTime * minutes)\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Mavericks update broke keyboard shortcut for switching Spaces I've upgraded to Mavericks from Mountain Lion. I've used the keyboard shortcut \"Control\" + \"number\" to switch between Spaces. The upgrade broke this. I've checked System Preferences and all the settings are the same as before. Is there a fix to restore this feature? Thanks\n\nA: I actually figured out how to fix this on the fly. \nI believe this state occurs when you inadvertently make a swipe gesture while a ctrl-key is held down. I can't be sure of that, but the fix is to do exactly that: hold down the ctrl-key, and then do the desktop-switching swipe gesture (for me it is 3-finger swipe left or right). \nI don't know how to prevent it from happening, but it's so quick to fix that it has become a non-issue for me.\n\nA: System Preferences > Keyboard, as seen here:\n\nOnly existing desktops will be shown here, so first add the desktops, then come here to check the boxes.\n\nA: Try this.

If they are you can safely trash / delete the plist file on your desktop. We just moved it there as a backup in case it didn't fix the problem.\n\nA: When new spaces are created, the little check boxes along side the shortcut in the mission control shortcut's are not ticked automatically. Therefore new Spaces are not enabled.\nMake sure they are ticked.\n\nAlso you could try and change the shortcut to something else.  Try those to see if they work.\nIf they do.

TL;DR\nSince it seems obvious that at present Apple can do nothing to help me: I need some way of getting as much of my content (music/apps/contacts/etc) out of this account... what can I do? All of my music/apps/contacts since like 2004 are in this account!\nThe answer which gives me the most ways of extracting my purchases will get the answer vote and bounty.\nIf my password is ever stolen I will not be able to change it, I would have to have the account locked and I would lose thousands of dollars worth of purchases!\nOk so I had enabled Apple's two-step authentication in order to have more security. It told me to \"save the recovery key in a safe place like your wallet\" so I just took that suggestion.\nNow, I was robbed. My wallet AND iPhone (my authorized device) were both stolen. Now I have no way of managing my iCloud account so I cannot:\n\n\n*\n\n*change my password\n\n*purchase anything from an iPhone\n\n\nIf I want to purchase new apps I have created a new account, but if there is an app already purchased on my old account I have to switch back and download it... however they changed it so now I cannot switch accounts on my iPhone for 90 days!\nThe only thing I can think to do, is to try and extract as much as I can from that account (contacts, music, apps) and then store them somewhere...\nI am kind of sad that I have lost functionality and Apple has made there literally be NO WAY to recover without at least 2 of the recovery options (my 2 were stolen).\nSo this is also now LESS secure, because if my password becomes compromised I have no way of changing it (can't manage account with only password now).\nAny idea what steps I should take? One I can think of is to go to all my accounts that I had used my iCloud e-mail for and change that. But as for my app purchases and music purchases, I am pretty much hosed.\nWill I be able to stop using the old account entirely (I guess have them lock it) but before I do that extract out my content for use? Music I can burn to MP3, but apps... I don't think I will be able to get updates for apps purchased under that account if I lock the account.\nEDIT just realized my apple developer account is bound to this login as well, FML\n\nA: The way this is supposed to work is to log in to https://appleid.apple.com and have several devices for authentication.\n\nHave you double checked that you don't have SMS as one of your options? If so, you can just get another SMS capable cell phone from the carrier using your number and be able to log in to reissue a new recovery key.\nTo paraphrase the KB article - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5577\n\nIf you lose permanently access to all of your trusted devices AND your recovery key, you will not be able to use that AppleID. \n\nHopefully you can either recover your phone or the wallet (police report and/or reward work in different situations) after a few days and add in some more items, regenerate your recovery key or disable the two-factor security on your account.\nAlso, you will want to make a phone call to developer support and ask if they have any way to assist you in enrolling another trusted device so that you can continue to do business with them. The developer program has far more ability to tell you from a random impersonator due to the legal forms and verification you may have filled out to enter the program and sell an app.\nAlso realize that Apple intentionally set this up knowing that some people would be in your situation and make sure you acknowledge that they don't have to help you out, but if they can find a way to, you would really appreciate it. However, since you have thousands of dollars at stake, I can't imagine you wouldn't be able to call into developer support and work with them to regain access as a one-time exception to the policy. Heck, Apple might be able to assist with a letter that corroborates a police report of the theft and open up options to claim this against insurance.\nLastly, check with your insurance since the cost to re-establish your accounts and purchases might just be covered. Your sure move is to get a new AppleID move on, securing it with more layers (and spread over more than one location) of verification devices. Hopefully, you can recover one of the items that was stolen and avoid the lengthy process of convincing either Apple or an insurance agent to help you out of this understandable but painful predicament.\n\nA: \"It told me to \"save the recovery key in a safe place like your wallet\" so I just took that suggestion.\"\nIt also said \"You should consider printing more than one copy, so that you can keep your key in more than one place.\"\nIt also encouraged you to register more than one phone number that can receive SMS messages and made you tick that you understood what would be required to reconnect.\nTake responsibility for your mistakes.

I bought my iPhone 5s about 3 days ago.Once i bought it i activated the phone from one of my friend's AppleID and password , because i needed to check if the phone functions well, before i leave the shop.but then after when i got back home i made a new apple account and used the phone with that account.\nBut since my phone is activated from my friend's iCloud i logged into account from his appleID and password. then i removed the device from his account. Then i erased the phone then rebooted it and setup a new i phone  with my AppleID and iCloud but still my phone is NOT Activated in my new account??\ncan someone please help me to activate my phone from my new account???? \n\nA: A full set of instructions are listed here: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH13695?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*you will need your friend to activate your phone at the Activation Screen during set up. The place you are stuck on.\n\n*After that, reset the device by going to Settings > General > Reset.\n\n*It will ask for your friends Apple ID details. Enter them.\n\n*Once the phone has been reset, tell your friend to remove it from\ntheir Find my iPhone account.\n\n*Restart the device and now finally register it under your own Apple\nID.\nActivation is a separate process. The device is still registered under your friend's Apple ID. And you are simply registered to use your Apple ID on the device. This is what you're getting hung up on. Resetting the device will allow you to activate it (register the device) under your own Apple ID. Signing out of your friends Apple ID in Settings does no affect device registration.\nAnd of note: If anyone may be attempting to bypass Activation Lock fraudulently or under false pretences, this cannot be done. Apple binds registration of the device to their servers. What that means is Apple will chase that device whenever it is connected to the Internet till the ends of time. Unless you can hack into Apple's servers, there is absolutely no way to bypass Activation Lock.\n", "Q: How do I avoid selfcontrol to stop just by changing time settings on mac? I loved selfcontrol, until stupid me found a way to go around it simply by changing the time settings. Then its the easiest thing to stop selfcontrol.

Tell them about this get around.\nAsk them if they could find a way to avoid it.\nFor example:\nHave their app check a online clock instead of the system clock.\nThat works like the Time and Date System preference which uses  Apple Americas/U.S. (time.apple.com.)\nSuggest that since you are able to connect to the net ( which I assume is the problem ) then access to the online clock is essential for the app to allow you to browse.\nIf the app cannot connect to the online clock it will not allow you to browser for a set period.\nAnd after that period example 2hrs. It will allow you 10 minutes grace to connect to or select a different clock in your time zone.\n And then stop for another two hours if it is still unable to connect to a clock.\nThe normal rules will apply if it can connect within the ten minutes grace.\n", "Q: How to create a Package, which runs a shell script?

Again, no success.\nEven adding the package and the configuration to Additional Resources seems not solve my problem.\nThank you very much for all solutions and ideas. Even a console solution via pkgutilis welcome.\n\nA: Could you do this with Platypus? I use it to package small executables with a shell script into an install app, which uses the shell script to move executables into the target folder on run. You're still going to have issues with your intended result however as I can't see any way around running a package install without requiring admin access IF the package normally modifies files that require admin permission, but you should be able to put the package, the configuration file, and the install script together into one app using Platypus. End users can then run the app to install the package with your desired configuration.\nThe setup is really simple, the output is minimal. This is not a program designed to do anything complicated but it is free and has been really useful for distributing self-written script-based apps.\n", "Q: Automator application needs to ignore all files that aren't EPS I've made an application that I drop EPS files on and it makes two copies and renames them and transfers them to SMB shares.\nBut sometimes when I have more than one file selected in other windows, Finder passes multiple files onto Automator.

The first time you hit the hotkey (which on my machine is hitting Fn twice), it loads the ~1GB of service into RAM.\nUnless you've unwittingly hit the hot key or activated some software that wants to use voice recognition, it shouldn't be loaded. That being said, if you don't want to use speech recognition, you could check the box to disable enhanced recognition and only consume ~18MB of RAM. The non-enhanced recognition action is that it samples your voice and sends it to Apple's servers (obviously creating limits and non-realtime feedback). The enhanced flag just loads those libraries on your Mac locally and avoids going to Apple's servers.\n\nA: I had to \"force quit\" it two or three times before I finally got rid of it.

I have trawled the internet and have a few clues:\nmount -t smbfs //user@server/sharename share\n\nThis doesn't work but I have seen another solution that uses the os module for the mount command:\nimport os\nos.system(\"mount -t smbfs //user@server/sharename share\")\n\nBut this doesn't work either.\nI have also read about creating a local mount point for the remote share to mount to. Is this true? And how would I go about this?\nMany thanks for any insights\nAll the best\nJohn\n\nA: I think, with the help of Tony Williams, I have figured it out.

It will then mount the smb share into it using a defined username/password.\n\nA: I would suggest you start setting up networking using System Preferences.\nGo to System Preferences/Network/Wi-Fi (or Ethernet)/Advanced/WINS and set your Workgroup to match the Windows Workgroup\nThen go to Finder/Go/Connect to Server\nTry to connect using smb://servername\nOnce you can connect you can try to automate.\n\nA: The first thing to do is to try and get it working at the command line.\nWhat happens when you try it at the command line?\nThe first thing you might notice is that mount is likely to ask for the password for user \"user\", which it can't easily do in a python script. Next is that \"share\" has to exist ready to be a mount point and exist in the directory that python thinks is the current working directory since you didn't give a complete path to it.\nI would use mount_smbfs rather than mount. Check the manual page for this command. You would have a command line something like this :\nmount smbfs //user:password@server.example.com/sharename /Volumes/Share\n\nassuming that /Volumes/Share exists as a directory.\n\nA: This is a similar answer, and one I wound up using myself.\nimport os\n\nos.system(\"osascript -e 'mount volume \\\"smb://Server/Share\\\"'\")\n#Do my important functions\nos.system(\"umount /Volumes/Share\")\n\nThe pros are:\n\n*\n\n*Uses the keychain credentials for the current user\n\n*Will wake up a sleeping Mac to attach to the smb share\n\n*Will automatically create/delete the attachment directory in /Volumes\n\nThe cons are:\n\n*\n\n*You probably have to attach manually to the share through Finder the first time.  This will establish the credentials in keychain.\n\n*This might not be common, but on one of my Macs, this and open will open the server and immediately close it again.  Then it works fine on a second try.\n\nTony had good advice: check out the man pages and then try for yourself at a shell prompt first.\n", "Q: iPhone Not Charging When Plugged In?

After 5-10 seconds, you should see a \"Please Connect to iTunes\" image on the iPhone 4, and iTunes should prompt you to restore the software; follow the prompts and the instructions given above.\nIf the device is powered on, hold down both the power and home buttons until the device reboots and displays the \"Connect to iTunes\" image (generally, 5-15 seconds).\n from :https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/iPhone_4_Troubleshooting#Section_Corrupted_software\n\nA: You need to re-install \"Apple Mobile Device Support\". THis will the charging issue Windows users face.\n\nA: The cords are junk.I replaced 2 already.It may or may not recognize the device.It depends on how bad your cord is.If it does recognize the device.One of your internal wires are no longer connected and is separated.Happens often.I have never had issues with a motherboard not supplying enough power.Only on a  multi-port USB hub.Maybe.\n", "Q: What is this brown sticky residue in my MacBook Pro charge port? I have just noticed a brown type of sticky residue in my charge port on my MacBook Pro, it wipes off but not completely and to me it smells like battery. \nCan anybody tell me if I have a problem here, or if this is normal?\n\n\nA: The battery is no where near that part - it's in the hand rest portion of the computer. Also, lithium polymer batteries don't really ooze liquids that would travel that far inside the computer, so it's probably the result of a spill near that area or just corrosion (rust) of the contact once the plastic covering has worn away.\nHowever, any liquid or corrosion by the charging port should get checked out with someone moderately familiar with how electronics work - especially if you leave it plugged in and not on a fireproof table if you could be risking a fire in a house where people sleep or someone might not be aware enough to leave if trouble starts.\nThe time it would take for a technician to give your Mac the \"all clear\" would be 5 minutes and the screwdriver needed to pop the top. This is the equivalent of opening the hood and measuring the oil level in a car or truck.\nI would clean off the area with a cotton swab and watch. If any more coloration or liquid arrives, take it in for service. Also, if the liquid were inside, you will see some coming out of the thunderbolt port as well. If a bright light and light magnification (or iPhone picture with flash) doesn't show any additional moisture, you might be safe with just some surface rust / a one time wet magsafe connector.\n\nA: I have had something like this with several MacBooks.  \nThe MagSafe ports can attract ferrous particles - iron or steel filings, or even the small percentage of minerals in normal urban dust.  Combined with temperature change and humidity, such particles can start to corrode which can discolour the connector. \nIf it wipes off there should be little damage.  \nThese days I just watch out for any visible accumulation.  I find Blu-Tack brand adhesive good for collecting the stuff.  \n", "Q: How to add app inside application bundle (CrashPlan menu bar.app) to Spotlight index? The CrashPlan Menu Bar item app, is located as a sub item within the package of the main CrashPlan app: /Applications/CrashPlan.app/Contents/Resources/CrashPlan menu bar.app\nApplications are indexed by Spotlight, but applications within Application bundles are not on Mac OS X 10.7.5.\nHow to manually (Terminal) add such an app within an application bundle to the Spotlight index?\n\nA: I often use Automator to make a stand alone \"application\" that calls a script or embedded app so that I can place it's icon in the location of my choosing.\nThere are plenty of other frameworks like Platypus that do similar things.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus\n\nA: A workaround is to copy or move that application out of the parent application bundle.\nFor example below is the command to copy the \"CrashPlan menu bar\" item using Terminal.app:\n$ cp -R \"/Applications/CrashPlan.app/Contents/Resources/CrashPlan menu bar.app\" \"/Applications/CrashPlan menu bar.app\"\n\n", "Q: How can I make the icon of a folder to be a given .icns file?

This is my first Mac. On Windows I can set each network connection as either Home, Work or Public using \"Network Location\". Each mode has different sharing and security options.

I'm now no longer able to boot into Mac OS X, and did not mean to lose that functionality.\nI can't use any of the methods above, because I can't boot to the point that the chime sounds. All I can do is boot straight to Windows 7. The real issue right now is that I can't get on my network using either the built in WiFi adaptor, an external USB WiFi adaptor (Alfa), or using the Apple USB to Ethernet adaptor.\nAny help? I'm at your mercy. The Apple store is a good trip away for me, but if nothing else works, I'll try having a restore done there from the network. But if they can't boot to right stage either, I'm afraid I'm hosed.\n\nA: It sounds like the Windows reinstall overwrote your boot sector on your mass storage device.\nI'd attempt to reinstall rEFIit, under Windows, and see if you can get the option to choose your boot partition on boot up again.  If that doesn't work, there's a new tool called 'rEFInd' that is actively being developed.  There's a good article here on using the tool with an HP laptop running Windows.\nIf that doesn't work, a clean start is likely in order.\nYou'll need an OS X install DVD and an external drive (or an appropriately bootable external drive with an OS X install image) to re-install OS X.\nOnce your OS is reinstalled, you can re-BootCamp the MB Air.\n", "Q: Upgrade to Mavericks wipes out Python site-packages directory?

There is also no firewall between them and they are within 2 feet of each other.\nApple tech is supposed to \"just work\" and it almost always does so intuitively but this one has me scratching my head. What is going on here? \n\nA: With iOS 8 and OS X 10.10 Yosemite, you can share files over AirDrop between Mac and iOS.\nWith Mavericks and earlier, and iOS 7, this is not possible. AirDrop on iOS only works with \"other nearby iOS 7 devices\", and AirDrop on OS X only works \"between supported Wi-Fi-enabled Macs\" and they must \"click the AirDrop icon on their computers\".\niOS: Using AirDrop details the inability to share cross-platform:\n\nAirDrop for iOS supports only iOS 7 devices. You cannot use AirDrop on iOS to share with OS X, and OS X users can't use AirDrop to share with iOS devices.\n\n\nAirDrop on OS X is detailed in OS X: Can I use AirDrop with my computer? and OS X Mountain Lion: Share your files with others near you (emphasis mine):\n\nAirDrop is one of the great new features of OS X Lion and later, which provides a really easy way to share files between supported Wi-Fi-enabled Macs without having to connect through the local Wi-Fi network.\n\n\nTo see other people nearby, click the AirDrop icon in the sidebar of a Finder window. The other people must also click the AirDrop icon on their computers.\n\nAirDrop on iOS is detailed in iOS: Using AirDrop (emphasis mine):\n\nAirDrop lets you share photos, videos, websites, locations, and more with other nearby iOS 7 devices.\n\n\nA: With 10.9 and iOS 7 - each OS family can drop within similar OS, but not across the divide.

I right-click on each icon in the dock on their respective desktops, and check Assign To This Desktop.  I can right-click again any number of times to verify that that option is indeed checked.  I can Cmd+right and Cmd+left across them, or Cmd+<number> to jump to the numbered desktop, and everything works fine.  In particular, the apps stay where they're supposed to.\nBut now I try to use Cmd+Tab to switch apps and the desktop choice gets changed.  Using the example above, if I'm on desktop 3 looking at Calendar, and Cmd+Tab to Safari (which should be on desktop 1), Safari gets pulled over to desktop 2, while TextEdit gets pushed to desktop 1 (and I get taken to desktop 2).  The same sort of behavior happens with more apps and more desktops.  Basically, the desktops get shuffled so that the Cmd+Tab app is closest.\nI have no extra monitor or anything else unusual that I can think might be screwing anything up.\nIs there any way to permanently assign an app to a particular desktop and/or turn off this terrible shuffling behavior?\n\nA: The apps are not being moved to different desktops, but the desktops are being rearranged. To see the difference, put two apps on a space, then Cmd-Tab to one of the apps.  You will end up in a space that contains both apps, although the space will have been renamed and shuffled in the order.\nTo stop this, \n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Go into Mission Control\n\n*Uncheck Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\n\n\n\n", "Q: Program will not move to second monitor I am a student using a program to do practice questions. \nThe program is set up to run like the actual test program in that it will take up the whole screen and block other applications.

Is there a way I can arange which monitor is the primary or something similar?\n\nA: You should be able to accomplish this by dragging the menubar to the bigger monitor in System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement.

Sometimes my Mac (laptop + two external monitors) wakes up with the desktops on the wrong monitors. I could not understand why I was unable to move them back to the right monitor - they would just hit the edge of the monitor and I could not drag them any further. The solution turned out to be to create a fresh desktop on the monitor in question, then make the fresh one the active one. Upon starting Mission Control again, I was able to drag my desired desktop to any monitor, and then make it active again.\n\nA: You can only move non-active desktops between screens.\nIf the desktop you want to move is the only desktop on the screen, then create another desktop, make that the active desktop, and then drag the non-active desktop.\n\nA: There is a maximum number of spaces you can have per display.  I don't know if this number is determined by the resolution of your display, by memory, or if it is arbitrarily assigned.

I'm considering upgrading some of my machines from Snow Leopard to OSX Mavericks (and possibly buying a new Mac Pro), but I'm extremely concerned about losing the \"Save as\" option in third party software such as Photoshop, After Effects, Avid etc. My question to anyone running Mavericks is this: Have you come across any piece of software that still has a \"Save as\" option? (If anyone has had experience with an Adobe product running on Mavericks that would be even better).\n\nA: The answer to this question is complicated.  Way back in Lion, Apple began to offer optional API's to software developers that would make it easier for applications to manipulate different versions of saved documents.  The most noticable repurcussion of these updated APIs was the replacement of the Save As.. menu item by Duplicate and Rename... menu items.  For those interested in the details, the best guide is the relevant section of John Siracusa's masterful Lion review.  However, use of these new APIs was optional, and the old functionality is still supported in Lion, Mountain Lion, and Mavericks.  \nMost non-Apple software still uses the old Save As menu for now, but in Mavericks some of the Apple applications have migrated to the new Duplicate menu.  As far as I know, Apple has not announced any plans to make the Duplicate model mandatory in the future, so this inconsistency is likely to stick around for a while.\nBottom line: In Mavericks, most applications still have the Save As... menu item.\nPhotoshop in Mavericks, using the familiar Save As... menu item:\n\nTextedit in Mavericks, using the new Duplicate menu item:\n\n\nA: Third-party applications don't lose their \"Save as...\" option.  I use Photoshop and Illustrator CS5, and both still have \"Save as\".  So do the apps in Office:Mac 2011.

Lately I experience the problem that my fans are running high even with moderate usage and the body really heatens up.\nIt did this before, but only under heavy load (videos, flash or compiling of source files). Now it seems like a regular thing.\nI also have the comparison to another MacBook Pro, which is definitely not showing this behaviour, so I am quite sure that I am not imagining things.\nAlso one night when I closed the lid of my macbook, fans would not stop running (it seems it did not go to sleep mode).\nAny Ideas what might be the reason?\nThe only thing I can imagine is actually to open up the body and remove the dust from there with a spray duster.\n\nA: You should first determine if your computer is actually working harder due to some process(es) using a lot of CPU when they historically have not.  Open the Activity Monitor app and check your CPU idle percentage.\nIf your system is using a lot of CPU, the higher fan speed is likely justified.\nIf you are consistently showing >90% idle, while your fans are racing, you likely have a 'mechanical' heat issue (such as dust/grime on heat sinks or some air blockage.)\nIf it IS a dust issue, I'd expect you would have noticed the fan gradually increasing its 'unloaded system' speed over time.\nThere are also products that will let you monitor various sensors in your computer.  Some will also let you control your minimum fan speed.  My favorite is iStat Menus which has lots of options for what you want to watch and how you want to see it.\n\nA: An SMC reboot will do the trick. I had the same problem after upgrading to Mavericks with my 2012 MBA.....here is a link to how to do it. \n\nA: So I have been having this problem for the last couple of weeks .\nI finally fixed the problem and it was so weird I just had to post how I did it for you guys.\nI tried all the regular things every forum tells you to do such as: \nReset SMC, Reset PRAM, Ran Diagnostics, Cleaned the fans and heat sinks, Changed power cords ... nothing worked.\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded iStat Menus\n\n*I saw that CPU PECI Die was running at 300 degrees\n\n*Then I noticed my CPU usage bar would just to 101% and every time that happened a process called CUPSD was activating.

Had to share.\n\nA: It looks you have to clean the dust inside. This was the problem I had some time ago.\nCan recommend using free Macs Fan Control app to monitor fans speed, temperature sensors and to adjust fans speed.\n\nA: Same problem - my finding was a small cotton ball of fiber stuck at the vent of the fan. I obviously had to open the back of the laptop, but it was pretty easy if you have the right screwdriver heads. \nI tried Activity Monitor and couldn't find a culprit there. I didn't think my fan was getting dirty, but only did it in the end because I ran out of other options. And... found the problem :)\n\nA: I had a similar problem with the fan running at high speed all the time.  I opened up Activity Monitor and discovered that the \"Dashboard\" app was taking up some 60%+ of CPU.  I deleted all the windows in the Dashboard and the problem was solved.  \nSo clearly I and perhaps others need to be judicious in their use of Dashboard Apps.\nMay solve other people's problems also.\n\nA: I had the same problem where my fan was running on high virtually the entire time I was using my Macbook Pro (mid-2014), and found this site. \nAfter looking at the posts here I decided to check the Activity Monitor, and for me, it wound up being Google Chrome. The Chrome Helper processes were many, and multiple instances running at the same time.\nAfter trying (unsuccessfully) to stop each process (they would come right back each closure), I closed Google Chrome completely and the fan stopped running. \nUsing Safari only, I am not experiencing this problem (so far), and the computer is running much cooler. It looks as if I'll stick with Safari exclusively as my browser.\nI can't thank you enough for the info here. I hope this contribution helps others also.\n\nA: On My MacBook Air, my fan was running like hair dryer.\nChecked up Activity Monitor window and saw that a HP printer process was running with 300% CPU utilisation.\nRealised that, half an hour back, i sent a print command to a HP Inket Jet printer (but had not connected the printer yet on USB).\nInstead of killing the process, I connected the Printer. After the printout was over, I could see on the Activity monitor, that in around 30 seconds, the CPU was back to normal.\nNot sure, it is HP Driver issue or not?\nIf there is something spooled for printout and the printer is not connected, it must be the bad driver that still tries to use CPU to find out the PRINTER for end less time.\n\nA: Ok, I had the same issue suddenly and I was going crazy.\nWhat fixed it for me.\n1. Opened the back case while MBP was running.\n2. Blew on my high speed fan (due to my blow it stopped and started again) ha, then within milliseconds to seconds it came back to life - normal fan speed.\nSo my verdict, the fan controller app might have \"stuck\" so it needs a \"manual\" reset.\nOnce again, just blow the fan while powered on. \n\nA: I would definitely open activity monitor (Cmd+Space then search Activity Monitor) and go to CPU, then look at what is using the most.\nMine was Microsoft Outlook using approximately 250% of CPU. Closed it, fan immediately turned off. If it is a program you use all the time, try finding an alternative and see if it works better.\n\nA: I wanted to say that this discussion saved my life. \nI've already tried to do PRAM and SMC reset with no success. After reading the postings I identified my HP printer was taking 388% of my CPU. \nThen I've searched on how to shut it down (it was not working on the activity monitor) and found this post: \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/28453132#28453132 \nAfter doing that my CPU went back to normal.\n\nA: My Apple MacBook Pro, my fan would not stop running and the battery was running out very quick. I spoke to the Apple Technicians who could not sort out the problem.\nChecked up Activity Monitor window and saw that a HP printer process was running with 340% CPU utilisation.\nI went to System Preferences - Printers and Scanners and realised that there were 3 printers connected to it. Once I deleted the redundant printers, the process stopped running and the fans stopped running.\nThank you to this Google search! It's sorted. \n\nA: Same problem here, on a 2009 MacBook Pro 17\" - fans running insanely fast and the underside was too hot to have on my lap. The battery is 7 years old and ready for a replacement soon, so I thought it might be related. Otherwise the machine is still fantastic.\nChecked Activity Monitor and the Finder CPU usage was always maxed out, never below 98% whenever I had a window open. More windows just crippled the running speed of the machine.\nIt turns out that I had the Finder View Options set to show the Size of all files and also Calculate Size for all sub-folders, after inspecting some folder sizes a few weeks earlier. This was forcing the CPU to do loads more work than necessary. I switched these both off and instantly the Finder CPU dropped to less than 2%. The fans calmed, the machine sped up dramatically and was soon cool enough to handle.\nPhew! Nothing wrong at all, no need to reset Finder or SMC, replace fans etc, just an overworked Finder. Well worth remembering stuff like this, even if it common sense. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: I had the same problem. After a while I realized that the fans only ran high when I had Safari open. I turned of the Norton extension, and it resolved the issue. Hope this helps someone out there!\n", "Q: Updating iPhone with Jailbreak? I'm currently waiting for iOS 7.1, so I jail broke my phone to test out some features until then.\nWhat happens after I try to update to the new iOS ? Will I lose all pictures/data that I've created after my recent backup ? Or will I retain them and just lose the jail break ?\n\nA: *\n\n*If you do an OTA update on the device, you'll 'break' many things and the device probably won't boot.\n\n*If you do an update through iTunes, it may boot, but the jailbreak will be broken and the filesystem may be a bit messed-up.\n\n\nBasically, don't update your device.\n\nInstead, you need to wipe and restore your device.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of your device in iTunes (I don't trust iCloud backup with jailbroken devices).\n\n*Restore your device using iTunes.\n\n*Restore your backup to the device using iTunes.\n\n\nThe backup will contain many preference files for various Cydia tweaks, but they're fine to leave since the actual tweaks won't be there (it's not jailbroken any more).\nYou should end up with a non-jailbroken device with all your content excluding content for tweaks.\n", "Q: Streaming iPlayer from MBP to AppleTV I'm thinking of getting an Apple TV and streaming BBC iPlayer to it via my 2009 MacBook Pro. So:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible?\n\n*What is the quality like on ATV content? Does it break up or buffer continuously or is it more or less like watching TV?\n\n*Another solution I am thinking of is to hook up the MacBook Pro to the TV without ATV but using an HDMI (?) cable. Is this going to be good quality? Is it a viable option? Worse than Airplay?\n\nA: *\n\n*Based on an article in 2012, it should be possibile to AirPlay this easily.\n\n*The quality will either be 720P or 1080P, buffering based on the quality of your internet connection. If your connection is fast you have no problems as long as your stream can handle it ;) \n\n*Yes you can do this too, a cable is a direct connection not using Apple TV. It's cheaper as you don't have to buy an Apple TV. However, with Apple TV you can do much more - and it will show subtitles for example in a pre-chosen style. \n", "Q: iBooks margin is a waste of screen space On my 7.9\" iPad Mini Retina, I'd like to use the full screen to shown content.

disk3\ndiskutil eject disk4\ndiskutil eject disk5\ndiskutil eject disk6\n\nYou could also try using mdfind (or spotlight) to locate files with dmg or those names in it or dump the files that diskimages-helper has open:\nmdfind -name dmg\nsudo lsof | grep diskimage\n\nThe hdiutil tool also might be helpful if you want to use it to unmount / mount these disk images in a controlled manner. The files don't have to be dmg, but look for those first and perhaps img or iso as an extension.\n", "Q: Left Side Option key not working on Macbook Pro I recently bought a second hand 2010 MacBook Pro. Just discovered that the Left sided 'Option' key is not working. I have no comeback on this so trying to determine if I can either fix it myself or do I bite the bullet and go to a genius bar.\nI have checked the Keyboard Viewer and when I press the 'Option' key it does not respond. Every other key and modifier key works.\nSo are there further tests I can do? My gut feeling its a hardware problem, can these keys be replaced one at a time or does the whole keyboard have to be replaced? I believe its a costly job to do. I know its hard to answer without looking a the machine itself, just someone might have been in a similar position and can share the outcome.\nAny help or advice is much appreciated. \n\nA: I answered a similar question several months ago, the answer is somewhat applicable here as well.\nTry this...\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on your Mac while holding the option key on your keyboard.  If done correctly, and assuming a firmware password is not set, you should see your internal hard drive show up on the display.  If you DO have a firmware password set then you will be prompted to enter the password before moving on.  This is just to verify what you should see.\n\n\nIf you don't see these screens then your key is likely failed at the hardware level. If this is the case then you have to replace the entire top case since the keyboard is built into this component.  If the key had popped off you could replace just the key but any sort of functional (non cosmetic) repair requires the keyboard be replaced. The repair for this isn't terribly difficult although it is somewhat involved since the top case is basically the chassis that everything bolts to, meaning you have to tear the MacBook Pro down completely in the process.  iFixit has a great guide (and possibly a replacement part) that shows the process.\nIf you see what I describe above then your key is functioning properly at the hardware level and the issue instead rests somewhere in your operating system. To narrow down the issue I would create a test user account (or just enable and login to the Guest user) to see if the issue persisted when logged in as the test user.  If the issue persists for the test user then it's a system wide issue, if it doesn't then it's something in your ~/Library folder. If that didn't do the trick I would use Disk Utility to repair permissions, verify and repair the disk.  If need be I would reinstall the operating system, without first erasing the disk assuming you have data you'd like to preserve.\nHopefully that puts you in the right direction, good luck!\n", "Q: iMac is stuck in a login loop My iMac is stuck in a login bootloop.

How can I make iOS's Siri set an alarm AND name/label the alarm at same time?\nI set many alarms on my iPhone5S running iOS7, and sometimes it's hard to remember what I set them for when they go off.  With a label I'm reminded the purpose (of the alarm).  I don't want to take time to manually edit the alarm after Siri sets it--that's what I want Siri to do for me.\nSome discussion here with apparently no clear answer, or at least nothing that yet works reliably on my phone.\n\nA: Exactly say this: \n\nSet alarm for [time] labeled [insert name here]\n\nThis works for me every time, thus it should work for your appointments or alarms too. Make sure you say labeled right: click here for the pronunciation and\njust make sure the names aren't too long.\nNames I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hello\n\n*Triangle\n\n*Square\n\n\nA: You can also have Siri set reminders for you, in the Reminders app, instead of alarms.\n\nRemind me at time to task.\n\nIt also works for geofenced reminders:\n\nRemind me when I get home to task.\nRemind me when I leave here to task.\n\nThis right here is easily 75% of what I use Siri for, and I find it's a more fitting solution than using alarms—in my mind, alarms are for waking up. \n\nA: I found the best way is to say \"Set an alarm for [time] and label it [your label here].\n\nA: Heads up though...if you set a reminder, it can synch with your other Mac devices--causing a reminder to pop up on those too. A factor for me, since I've had a reminder to, say, call the divorce lawyer....and then this pops up on the desktop mac in front of the kiddos. If I'd prefer a reminder be JUST to me, I'll use the alarm instead.\n\nA: To make your reminders just appear in your own cloud when using family sharing I found a trick\nGo to reminders, hit the plus icon and make a new list in a different colour and label it.\nThen go to reminders in settings and change the default list to that one setting it to non family share.\nThat will be the reminder list that Siri will go to\n\nA: \"Hey Siri, Set a XXXX alarm for YY o'clock\" will set an alarm with the label \"XXXX\".\nI assume you want an Alarm, and not a Reminder (many of the answers here are about Reminders)\n", "Q: Are L-shaped and T-shaped Magsafe 1 interchangeable? I want to buy replacement Magsafe 1 cable for my MBP 17\" Late 2011, and they are available in two options — L-shaped and T-shaped. My computer was shipped with L-shaped connector, however I want to swap it for T-shaped, as I find it more convenient.\nSo, will it fit? Are there current restrictions on T-shaped connectors, e.g. won't they overheat when powering 85W MBP?\n\nA: In short no, there's no problem.\nApple changed the \"old\" T-models with new L-models.\nHowever, they are exactly the same and I've been using a 85Watt MagSafe charger for years now as it charges much faster.\nJust do it, and nothing will change, except if you go from 45/60 watt to 85 (it will load faster :)). It's just a new look, the connectors are exactly the same.\n\nA: Should't be a problem. The interface with the computer is the same. There shouldn't be any issues with overheating or anything.

Of course, before that happens, the fans are running full speed. \n(In this case, under Windows 7 via rEFInd.)\nThe game in question is Portal, which runs fine at full speed and resolution on this machine (not unexpected since the game is several years old), at least until it exits. \nI'm guessing this is due to the video driver terminating the application to prevent damage to the machine, but I can't be sure. \nOccasionally, even if not running that type of app - say, browsing the web or word processing - the machine will get very hot and the fans will kick in. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is this typical behavior for this machine, or something wrong with this particular unit?\n\n*I've read that the cooling system has been redesigned in the new models.

Question; Does Time machine takes 2 backups (each on one hard disk) or 1 back up distributed on both hard disks. (when using 2 external hard drives.)\nBecause if I select 2 different external hard disks in TIME MACHINE preferences, It says \"Time Machine will take turn backing up to 'disk 1' and 'disk 2'\"\n\nA: They are two separate backups.  Time Machine will back up to whichever drive is currently connected.\nI make use of this to alternate two Macs in my household between two Time Machine disks.  Each drive contains a complete copy of each Mac as of the last time it was connected, as well as all past snapshots made to that drive that haven't been deleted to make space.  Either one is thus useful on its own for restore purposes, even if the other is destroyed or corrupt.\nIf you connect two drives simultaneously, the same result occurs (each drive is a complete backup); Time Machine will alternate backing up to each.\n", "Q: Why is Terminal.app corrupting my tcsh history?

In my .history file, the corrupt commands are repeated with the same command number:\n#+1391563259\n[1m[4mcomputername:~/Code/emacs-source ( 1827 ) $[0m[24m\n#+1391563259\nUse \"logout\" to logout.\n#+1391563259\n[1m[4mcomputername:~/Code/emacs-source ( 1827 ) $[0m[24m logout \n\nThis seems to be a result of closing Terminal.app windows and tabs, but I'm not sure why. To fix it -- since I have history merging enabled -- I've had to resort to closing all tcsh sessions and removing the corrupt commands from .history. Is there some way to prevent this from happening in the first place?\n\nA: Are you cutting/pasting commands and picking up some of your prompt by accident? \nIt's not quite the answer you're looking for but throw sed -i.bak -e \"s/\\x1b[[0-9;]{1,5}m//g\" .history into your .logout or cron it and you shouldn't have to clean it manually again.\n\nA: I'd forgotten about this issue, but here's an update. The tcsh savehist merge feature is not atomic, so closing multiple sessions simultaneously can lead to history file corruption:\nhttps://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=632892\nI don't know if this has been fixed or will be fixed; I finally got fed up of this and other tcsh issues and switched to bash.\n", "Q: To make substitles for audio in OSX I have many recordings where I want English subtitles.\nHowever, those subtitles do not exist. \nSo it would be great to have some application which could pick up some words and make a raw subtitle.\nIs there any good software to make subtitles from recordings in OSX?\n\nA: Video Lan Client can play just about every format of subtitle that's out there.\n", "Q: Launchpad Search Field not working - cannot type The launchpad search field suddenly no longer accepts text input for me.\n\nAny idea how to get this to accept text again?  Searching for an app was so very useful.\n\nA: Hit the tab key a few times. Worked for me.\nYou need to hit Tab once the launchpad screen comes up. The tab will then put focus on the search bar, and then pressing it again will remove it. Pressing it ~20times seems to cause some sort of reset. Once you visibly notice the cursor, things should be good. \nOther things to try: \n\n\n*\n\n*terminal > defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock\n\n*logout / login\n\n*restart\n\n\nA: Hit the tab key until a cursor shows up in the search bar at the top of the launchpad view.  As mentioned in some of the comments, you could have to hit it 20 times or more.\n\nA: I had the same problem today. On the Apple forums, I found a tip to delete the contents of ~/Library/Application Support/Dock and to restart the Dock using killall Dock afterwards. This causes Launchpad to rebuild its database and supposedly should reactivate the search field.\nI tried this and it did not work for me initially. \nMeanwhile, I applied another tip, namely to repair the disk permissions with the disk tool (and then forgot about the topic). \nA couple of hours later (now) - when I was looking for alternative solutions on Ask Different - I was suddenly able to search again in Launchpad. \nSo I expect, that either one of the tips or both in combination did the trick.\n\nA: Merely rebooting the laptop did the trick for me. \n\nA: NOTE: This ALSO works when you can't rename a grouped folder on the launch pad. ie: drag two apps on the launchpad together and create a group, then open it, click the name and try to rename it. - I had to hit the tab key like 50 times.\nThis issue goes back many years, and isn't just OS Sierra. So whatever is around after Sierra, try this first before deleting files, messing with file permissions, or completely resetting Launchpad. This method, you don't have to logout. I have tons of stuff open all the time, and hate logging out. It's a preparation process.\nSo tap the tab button anywhere from 20 to 50 times. It's worth a shot before doing anything else :)\n\nA: In the Launchpad, press Cmd + Shift + esc. The pad will fade and zoom, and when you hit it again it works so you can type again.\n\nA: Tab 20 times or so worked for me. \n", "Q: Change the Volume OSD position Is it possible to change the position of the on screen display (OSD) of the volume indicator that appears when you change the volume with the keyboard?

I'm using Airport Utility 5.6.1 on Mavericks (installed from links here). I'm trying to figure out how the Advanced > Syslog Destination Address setting works... \n\n\n*\n\n*What kind of value is that field anticipating? just an IP address of some machine running OSX? a full URL to...what?\n\n*Has anyone reading this ever used that setting before?\n\n*Is there a better way to access full debug logs for the Airport Extreme or Time Capsule?\n\n*Does Airport Utility 6 offer any log access? I'm not seeing anything...\n\n\nA: You're probably way over this, by now, but I just set up log capture from my 5th gen Airport Extreme to my Mac Mini (running Mavericks), so I'll chime in for posterity.\n\n\n*\n\n*Syslog Destination Address does expect an IP address. The computer at the end of that ip address has to be configured to be a log server (and OSX can be configured for this... see below).\n\n*I've only just started forwarding the logs, but I've looked at the logs before.\n\n*AFAIK, apart from more directly viewing/exporting a recent sample of the logs through the \"Logs & Statistics\" button on the advanced tab, there isn't another way to access them.\n\n*Apple removed log access (along with many other useful feature) from the Airport Utility 6 because...I dunno...they're hateful succubi seeking to relieve everyone of both money and control. You'll have to stick with 5.6.1 as long as you can.\nConfiguring OSX (Mavericks) to record the logs\nAs for configuring my Mavericks Mini to be a log server, I followed the instructions here (which I think is the same blog post that @drevicko mentioned, only in a different location).\nTo briefly summarize, you need to add the following to the Sockets section of /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist :\n\n<key>NetworkListener</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>SockServiceName</key>\n    <string>syslog</string>\n    <key>SockType</key>\n    <string>dgram</string>\n</dict>\n\nEditing the file requires that you convert it from binary to text and then back to binary once you are done.  The blog post has instructions to do this using plutil -convert\nAfter the changes have been made, you need to restart the syslogd Daemon (instructions also in the blog post):\n$ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist\n$ sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*When you configure the airport to send logs to a particular IP in your network, you should keep in mind that it may very well be a dynamic IP. In my case, the Airport could (and would) one day decide that my Mac Mini should be 10.0.1.5 instead of 10.0.1.2. Fortunately, you can create a DHCP reservation, in the Airport, to always give a particular machine a particular address.\n\n*Once set up to receive the airport logs, you can view them using the console application on OSX. They'll be mixed in with everything else (in the \"All Messages\" view), but you can find them all in the \"system.log\" section.\n\n", "Q: How to export a list of recently opened files from Office:MAC? 2011? I recently inherited some old mac machines and was told to look for anything important on the before formatting them.  \nOne of the things that is installed on these machines is Office:MAC 2011, and everytime I open one of these documents I'm concerned that another falls off the recently opened list.  \nI'd like to save the list of recent files some how so that I don't loose anymore recently opened documents.\nIs it possible to somehow export this list so I can view the list without destroying the list?\n\nA: You can do this, but it's complicated.\nThe recent documents for all Microsoft office products are stored in a preferences file (plist) in each users's library:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.plist\nThis file is in standard plist format, and can be viewed using the plist viewer built into Xcode.  If you open it up it will look something like this:\n\nThe list of recent items for each application is stored in the key File MRU.  The example above is for Word, which corresponds to the MSWD code.  Each document compromises one numbered item under this plist key.\nAs you can see, unfortunately the values for these keys are binary encoded, not plain text, so you need to paste the Value strings into a Hex editor to see the file names and paths.  (I use HexFiend .)\n\nBottom Line: Copy the com.microsoft.office.plist file to a safe location.  With some elbow grease, you can pull all the recent files out of this document.\nYou could also check out this Python script that does some of this parsing automatically, but your mileage may vary.\n\nA: The location of the property list with the recently opened files has changed since BringMyCakeBack's answer was posted. They are now kept in ~/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Word.securebookmarks.plist. The file is in a binary format that Xcode understands. See also here.\n\nA: Based on my research there is no way to do this. However, what you could do is:\n\n*\n\n*Change the number of files that appear in the list\nor\n\n\n*Pin the files to the list\nSee this link for more information.\n\nA: If you want to keep a running list of documents you are going to open moving forward, add this macro to your Normal.dot\nSub AutoOpen()\n    Dim ff As Long\n    Dim logpath As String\n\n    logpath = MacScript(\"return (path to desktop) as string\") & \"autoopen_log.txt\"\n\n    ff = FreeFile\n    Open logpath For Append As #ff\n    Print #ff, ActiveDocument.FullName\n    Close #ff\nEnd Sub\n\nIt will log the path of every file you open in Word to the specified text file on your desktop. You can just reopen the existing recent files to add them to the log.\n\nA: I ended up implementing this in Swift and not even using it (because the format changed in Office 15), but if anyone else still needs it:\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc getMRUList(forApp: String) -> [String]? {\n    guard let defaults = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().persistentDomainForName(\"com.microsoft.office\") else {\n        NSLog(\"Unable to find Office defaults\")\n        return nil\n    }\n\n    guard let mruList = defaults[\"14\\\\File MRU\\\\\" + forApp ] as? [NSDictionary] else {\n        NSLog(\"Unable to find recent documents for Office application \\(forApp)\")\n        return nil\n    }\n\n    return mruList.flatMap { (mruItem: NSDictionary) in\n        guard let mruFileAliasData = mruItem[\"File Alias\"] as?

NSJSONSerialization.dataWithJSONObject(mruList, options: NSJSONWritingOptions()), encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)!)\n}\n\nYou can replace MSWD with the creator of another Office 14 app (e.g. PPT3 for PowerPoint, XCEL for Excel) as appropriate.\n\nA: If you just want to produce a list of Office documents that have been opened on this Mac, just create a Spotlight search with the following criteria:\n\nThis gives me a list of every Microsoft file that has been opened (in the last 20 years). You can then sort the list by date.\nYou can specify each exact Office file type individually, of course.\n", "Q: How to block Angry Birds Toons movies in iOS App (like Angry Brids Go) Angry Birds Go comes with a menu item where you can watch Angry Birds Toons and other movies. Is it possible to block these movies (as a \"parental control\")?\nFor example: Is the server serving the movies known such that I can block the server in the router?\n\nA: I was having the same problem.\nThis is a solution:\nhttp://www.imore.com/how-block-specific-websites-being-accessed-safari-iphone-and-ipad\nIt was slightly different on the Air but very easy to figure out. I just checked \"Specific Websites Only\" and it was already populated with JUST kid friendly stuff that did not include the birds :)\n\nA: You certainly could block the IP and/or domain in your router.

But even if thats not what the question is about, that is what the, um, \"correct answer\" is kind of about?\nSo I'll give it a shot anyway...\nThe short answer to the title question: in short, no. \nThere is only one implementation... per supported controller.\nhfs_unmap_free_ext doesn't refer to the hfs_unmap_free extent function.  \nIt refers to the kext which does the \"hfs_unmap_freeing.\"\nThe error,\nhfs_unmap_free_ext: ignoring trim can occur for one or both of two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The drive is one that uses a supported controller, but has not been \"blessed\"\nwith an Apple serial number and firmware. In this case, patching this protection out\nthe kernel extension - what Trim Enabler does - will enable TRIM since the hardware\nhas a driver which supports it.  \n(Also, myself, I would consider patching the kernel to be almost the definition of something\nintergral to the operating system.)\n\n*It is ignored because although the device advertises that it supports TRIM, \nthere's no TRIM driver in the kernel for that controller, since Apple never shipped a\ndrive based on that controller in the first place. So it just uses generic ATA commands.\n(This is probably the case with your drive, due to the \"not recognized as an SSD\" bit.)  \n\nWhile:\n\nthey have programmed in nanosecond-critical timing loops that match perfectly with the access timings of the controllers used in Apple’s SSDs\n\nis a true statement, that's definitely not why Apple locks drives. They do that so you can't get in-warranty support for a third party drive.\nApple doesn't make drives; but if you read up how Tim Cook (while COO) cornered the Asian NAND flash market a few years back - more or less why he's CEO today - you'll understand why flash manufacturers allow Apple to dictate stuff like this.\nOther than that, I'm not sure you're going to find much more than that thats \"authoritative\" I'm afraid. Like you said, most of this stuff is closed source, though you can find traces littered everywhere, with includes like this one. Also, note that TRIM is more of a concept/implementation thing than a standard (at least with anything prior to SATA 3.1).\nI can also confidently tell you that TRIM enabled/Apple-logo branded SSDs can only be purchased through GSX (or the grey market). And that Trim Enabler works quite well.

I would use the Recovery HD to run fsck / Disk Utility since that is less likely to have corruption than your OS (which still runs in a limited mode in single user mode).

Is there anything I can do to retrieve these lost files?\n\nA: If you've deleted them, you'll need to have a backup to restore the file from. If it's a laptop, hopefully you had local snapshots enabled, in which case you can go to the folder that contained your iPhoto library, enter Time Machine and restore the file.\n", "Q: Video Output as iSight Input I'd like to be able to display videos and pictures through my MacBook Pro's webcam on Skype and other online chat sites. I previously used programs such as ManyCam to emulate a webcam, however, many online sites no longer accept external video inputs - only iSight (built-in or external).\nIs there any way to be able to send the output from ManyCam to the input of iSight? This way, I can still display videos on sites which only allow iSight, as the video will technically be coming from an iSight cam.\n\nA: Camtwist works for such things\n(haven't yet personally tested it in mavericks)\n", "Q: OSX app to paste and save HTML content? In Gmail, I can go to a web page, highlight web content, compose a Gmail message, and paste the HTML content into the email message. It works in Mail.app as well. \nBut what app can I use to just paste the HTML content and then save it as an HTML file? \nMicrosoft Word will accept pasted HTML content, but I don't want to save as gross weird Microsoft Word HTML markup. Is there an OSX app where I can easily paste and save copied HTML content from web pages? \n\nA: Although this is an old question, it's still relevant, and here is the answer:\npbpaste -Prefer rtf | textutil -stdin -convert html -output outputfile.html\n\nThis uses the built-in OS X pbpaste utility to pipe the contents of the clipboard to stdout (-Prefer rtf is probably unnecessary but doesn't hurt), then runs it through the built-in textutil program. The -stdin argument makes textutil take its input from pbpaste; -convert html tells it to turn the input into HTML; and -output outputfile.html tells it to write the output to a file called outputfile.html.\nIf you find that the output has some unnecessary elements, you can exclude them with -excludedelements; for example, -excludedelements '(span, font, head, xml)'. Note that you need to have the single quotes because your shell will try to interpret the parentheses as a special shell expression.\n\nA: Why not just save the page using the browser?\n\n\n*\n\n*File → Save As… (⌘S)\n\n\n*Choose Page Source or Web Archive\n\n", "Q: How can I get Messages app? I deleted my Messages app but I'm not sure how to re-install it.\nWhat can I do?\nI'm on 10.9.1 by the way.\n\nA: Use a backup\nIf you have a Time Machine backup (or other backup of the system), you can restore the file from there. Browse to the folder in Finder and enter Time Machine, go back in time until the file is found then restore it.\nCopy the file from another system or a trusted person's machine\nIf you have a second machine with a comparable build of OS X installed on it, you can copy the file from it. Feel free to ask for the checksum of a file in chat to compare it to if you wish to make sure that the file is correct (not modified accidentally/purposefully).\nPacifist with OS X install media\nIf you've got an OS X install media and Pacifist, you can browse the install media and grab the file.\n\nIf you have Pacifist but no install media, it will prompt you to download the installer.\n\nReinstall OS X\nIf you've got the ability to reinstall OS X through the Recovery HD, Internet Recovery or an OS X install media then reinstalling OS X will 'repair' your install and copy any missing/broken system files back to your system.\n", "Q: Why no Deliver notice? When I text 1 person (who also has iphone) the message never says Delivered but the person does get the message.  Why doesn't it say delivered like it does to anyone else I text with iMessage?\n\nA: There are a few possibilities. \nThis person has iMessage disabled in their settings. \nThey have an older iPhone that doesn't support iMessage. \nThey have mobile data turned off, in which case, they would only be able to use iMessage when connected to wifi. \n", "Q: My MacBook Pro mid-2010 won't recognize new hard drive I was forced to change my HD since the old one gives me I/O error on boot.\nI bought a Western Digital Blue WD5000LPVX, connected by USB to another Mac and format it using Mac OS Extended (Journaled) file system.\nWhen I change the new hard drive and boot OS X Mavericks from USB drive, going to Disk Utility the new HD isn't recognized.\nIs it a wrong HD for my Mac? Why isn't it shown in Disk Utility?\nUsing a MacBook Pro mid-2010\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work for you since you've got an error on boot, but if your OLD drive can get into recovery mode, I did a pretty extensive write up on swapping hard drives here: How do i install OS X on new hard drive? I have macbook pro mid 2010.\nIf it doesn't, based on my research, you'll need another Mac to create a bootable install from a USB device of at least 8 GB. \nThis question is really old, but just in case someone runs across it, I figured I'd put in my $.02. In addition sometimes this problem may occur due to the HDD cable itself failing a Apple known problem with this model. In which case a new cable usually allows communication with the HDD to work internally as it should. While many Hdd refused to work internally they booted externally just fine.  These cables run $30 to $60 depending on where you buy.\n", "Q: Can't see A1084 AirPort Express behind A1354 AirPort Extreme Can anyone please make any suggestions...? (Preferably, step by step instructions to resolve this issue).\nI am using AirPort Utility 6.3.2 on a MacBook Pro running MacOS X 10.9.1 Mavericks.  AirPort Utility suddenly can't see my two A1084 AirPort Express base stations behind my A1354 AirPort Extreme (which is running Firmware version 7.6.4).  The Extreme is behind a CenturyLink Actiontec C1000A DSL modem, which is connected to the Internet.\nIf I use AirPort Utility set the Extreme to \"DHCP and NAT,\" the utility shows that the Extreme has \"Double NAT.\"  \n\nIf I set the Extreme to \"Bridge Mode,\" that issue resolves.  \n\nBut, in neither case can I see the AirPort Express base stations.  \nThere is a control to disable NAT in the Actiontec C1000A DSL modem's admin panel, but an attempt to make that change doesn't \"take\" when I click on \"Apply\").\n\nBecause the AirPort Express units are old, only the old AirPort Utility (v5.x) can be used to configure them - but, that old version does not run under Mavericks.\n\n\nA: I cannot comment your post, but at least I have a suggestion: Download a copy of Airport Utility 5.6 working with Mavericks here.\nEdit: it seems to me your network is working as always (at least before you began fiddling...:-)), but the thing is you updated Airport Utility to the newest version and therefore cannot see the Expresses? This is a \"feature\" of the newest Airport Utility.\n", "Q: Very slow screen refresh on server screen share I have a brand new Mac Mini, configured with Intel i7, 16GB, dual SSDs... basically the top of the line Mac Mini you can buy as of 2/1/2014. I also purchased the latest Airport Extreme, with 802.11ac and I'm connecting to my Mac Mini with the greatest and latest MacBook Pro, which also has an 802.11ac.\nFor some reason, when I use screen share to connect to my Mac Mini from my MacBook Pro (through the Airport Extreme), the screen redraws very slowly, the mouse pointer tracks very slowly, and the whole experience is just sluggish even at 1280x1024.\nJust before I upgraded to the Mac Mini, I had the same setup with the previous generation Airport Extreme, and a 27\" Intel i5 iMac. When I connected with my MacBook at native 27\" display resolution, the response was very fast and snappy.\nHow could I possibly have a faster computer and network and have terrible screen share performance?\nAs a side note (not sure if this is related), I run Windows 2012 Server in Parallels on that same Mac Mini, when I connect to is via Remote Desktop Connection, I have the same problem. Again, the previous generation setup (Windows 2008 on the older Airport Extreme and i5 iMac) worked far faster.\nThe CPU and memory is idle 99% of the time on the Mac Mini.\nThank you.\n\nA: After much ado, I figured out that the reason the performance is so terrible in the remote Mac Mini is because it is head-less and the GPU is not being engaged (according to this answer). I ended up ordering the headless adaptor for $15 and problem solved.\n", "Q: Automator to save all images in multiple mail messages Is it possible to use automator to save all images from my Mail? I use Apple mail with 3 accounts, I want to filter messages by a criteria and get all the images from the messages? Can anyone tell me how can this be done?\n\nA: I just tried this and it seemed to work, though you'll have to play with it.\n\n", "Q: Changing Photo thumbnails We have one photo that overrides all the photos in iphoto thumbnails.  When we pull the photo up it is different than what is on the thumbnail.   We want to get rid of the thumbnail photo and have the actual photo underneath show.\n\nA: Since it's only one photo you might find it easiest to Export it from iPhoto (as a .png perhaps) as \"Current\", then open it in Preview and rotate it four times, then Save it (if it's .png then you won't lose quality). Preview should have made a new thumbnail for you— now you can re-import into iPhoto and check to make sure everything is ok. You will have to redo location, Faces, and tagging info. But if everything is satisfactory then you can delete the messed up version you had before.\nIf you have lots of images with wrong thumbnails then you should launch iPhoto while holding CMD Option and rebuild the database. \n", "Q: How to display zero value as blank cell in mac numbers 3.1 How do I display zero value as blank cell in mac numbers 3.1 yet maintain a formula.  I want a running balance column that only shows balance to the line of the last entry like a checkbook register.\nThanks.\n\nA: The easiest way is to use \"Conditional Highlighting...\" found under the \"Format\" menu.\nSelect the cell you want to have blank as zero then select \"Conditional Highlighting\" you then set a highlight when the cell is equal to zero. Choose  \"Custom Highlighting\" at the bottom of the style list and then you can set the text colour to white. A \"blank\" cell on zero.\n\nA: Here's a simple approach:  =If(A1<=0,\" \",A1)\nYou're simple saying:  If the result displayed in Cell A1 is less than or equal to 0, display what's between the parenthesis.  It could be Yes, No, Blue, Green, or just Blank space.  If Cell A1 is greater than 0, display the value of that cell.\nYou don't have to leave a space between the \"\" for the formula to work.  Try a simple test of the formula on different values and watch as the cell will switch to a Blank value, if the Cell is less than or equal to 0.  Logic formulas using If, And, Or and If And switches are powerful tools in many calculations goals.\n", "Q: Share calendar with non iOS user How does one share their calendar with a non-Iphone/ios user? I've tried everything and it seems that all your downloads and accesses keep you chasing in circles.\n\nA: If you have an iPhone and you use the calendar on it then you can easily put it in Apple's cloud, iCloud, and from there it is easily shared.\nFirst, on your phone go to \"Settings\" and select iCloud. Make sure Calendars is is flicked across to green and your Calendar is in the cloud.\nNow in a web browser go to iCloud.com and click on \"Calendar\". This will show you all the calendars you have in the cloud. See my example below :-\n\nNow if you click on the pie slice to the right of the name it brings up a sharing dialog.\n\nIf the other person also has an iCloud account then you can share your calendar to them privately and allow them to edit it. Otherwise a public, read only share can be given to anyone who can read a calendar in CalDAV format. You can see the incredibly long address in the screen shot. It's so long it is best to email it to someone straight from the dialog. Click on the \"Email Link...\" link and you can be sure the right address is sent.\n\nA: I discovered that Google Calendar is capable of integrating with the reading of the iCalendar CalDAV format if you create your iCloud calendar as a Public Calendar. Plus it will sync to the user's Android phone too.\n\n\n*\n\n*You just go to http://www.google.com/calendar on a computer, login with your google account. \n\n*On the left side, click on the arrow to the right of \"Other calendars\", click on \"Add by URL\"\n\n*Paste in the public iCloud calendar URL into the window that comes up.\n\n*Then open your Android calendar app, and go into the app Settings and click on \"Calendars\". You will now see an new calendar by the name of your iCloud calendar.  Simply check the box, and you will start seeing the iCalendar from within your android calendar app.\n\n", "Q: How to turn on Hardware Virtualization on Late 2013 MacBook Pro (for Windows 8.1 using Boot Camp)? I am trying to turn on Hardware Virtualization for my new MacBook Pro for Windows 8.1 setup using Boot Camp.\nI have searched online and I know that we can not just go to the BIOS like windows and change settings. Unfortunately, most of the solution I have come across are for Parallels or VMs.\nCan anyone kindly let me know how to enable Hardware Virtualization on MBP for Windows 8.1 installed using Boot Camp?\n\nA: It seems that if you boot directly to Windows it doesn't work, but if you boot to OS X and switch to Windows, it works. Or you can boot to Windows, change to OS X and go back to Windows again.\n\nA: It sounds like you're running into the same issue I did, where after booting into Windows the VT-x shows as 'Disabled' in Task Manager. \nNot sure how or why, but after going into \n\n\n*\n\n*OS X \n\n*System Preferences \n\n*Target Disk \n\n*Select the BOOTCAMP disk as the\nstartup disk\n\n\nEverything was well after that and I could happily use Hyper-V, even from a cold boot. \nIf I cold booted using the Options-key, and then selecting Windows, VT-x was disabled in Task Manager.\nGo figure. Could some Mac genius out there explain this one?\n\nA: There is no hardware virtualization to turn on or off like on Wintel PCs.\nThat switch and many other BIOS switches are there because (at least in part) the hardware manufacturers don't make the hardware AND software, like Apple does.\nIt is always on in any Mac that has a processor that supports virtualization. Pretty much any Mac in the last several years does so you are good to go with this one.\n\nA: EDIT: I found a better way to get this working instead of the boot dance originally suggested (it's below for reference). Basically set enable_and_lock_vmx true in rEFInd and that's it. Details below ...\nSuggested method\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable macOS System Integrity Protection/SIP (Reboot Mac, hold down Command + R keys, at \"OS X Utilities Utilities\" pick \"Terminal\" menu item -> type in terminal csrutil disable; reboot)\n\n*Back inside macOS after the reboot, get rEFInd and extract it anywhere (desktop, downloads etc)\n\n*Open a terminal window, cd to where you extracted it and edit via sudo nano refind/refind.conf-sample\n\n*Uncomment enable_and_lock_vmx and set to true i.e. the whole line should read enable_and_lock_vmx true. <= This is what really fixes the issue!\n\n*[optional] While here, change the timeout to something quick, like 4 or 5 i.e. timeout 4\n\n*Install rEFInd by running ./refind-install from terminal. The sample config you edited is used as the installed config.\n\n*[optional] Enable SIP again. Follow #1 above but run csrutil enable; reboot instead\n\n\nThis method is very smooth - it works on normal as well as encrypted disks (FileVault2, VeraCrypt or BitLocker) and really takes a few minutes to install. Best of all, it works in every reboot.\nOld method\nNone of the other methods worked for me, especially since my Windows 10 was Bitlocker encrypted i.e. it doesn't show up in Startup Disks to chose to reboot to. The steps below work though\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off\nNot just a hard reboot; fully powered off; as in 'count to 10 when off' off\n\n*Power on and Boot to OS X desktop\nThis process loads virtualization properly. In my case, I had to hold option and select OS X, enter my FileVault password (my OS X is encrypted) and then wait to boot into OS X desktop.\n\n*Reboot to Windows\nSoft reboot via the Apple menu i.e. top left Apple icon => restart. During bootup select Windows/Bootcamp (via the option key). My Windows was Bitlocker encrypted, so I entered the disk password, booted to Windows, entered Windows password, landed on Windows 10 desktop. This time Hyper-V was present and functional!\nI'm putting this here for future reference but I hope Apple actually fixes their Bootcamp boot process. It's been broken for 8 years now and the above hackery is ridiculous for a $3000 machine and when Bootcamp is an officially supported Mac feature.\n\nA: I tried with and without holding alt key down, from Mac OS to Windows and the other way.\nThe Hyper-V installation begins and asks for a reboot, and during starting up of windows then 2nd step of the installation failed and rolled back.\nToday I bought thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter, plugged it, installed Hyper-V and after reboot I could use it.\nEven when I unplug the adapter.\nSo it seams Hyper-V need some sort of Ethernet Adapter installed.\n\nA: After I installed rEFInd to triple boot my MF839 Macbook (Win10, Ubuntu, OSX), to enable Virtualization on Windows 10, first I boot to OSX, then when it's login screen appear, I hit the restart button so the mac restart again then I choose Windows 10 from rEFInd.\n\nA: I had tried all the various boot / reboot combinations and nothing worked until I added the Thunderbolt to Ethernet adaptor. The next time I started up the Windows Boot Camp partition I could enable Hyper V. \n", "Q: iPad app on MBA maverics Compatibility question\nI want to download the BBC iPlayer from the iTunes store on my Mac Book Air (10.9), but it is only available for iPad or iPhone as shown here:\n\nCan I still somehow use it on my MBA ?\n\nA: You can't.\nIPAs downloaded from the App Store are built for the ARM processor in actual iOS devices. Even if you signed up as a developer which would give you access to the iPhone Simulator, it's not an emulator and can't run ARM code.\nThe only way you can run iOS apps on OS X is if you have the iPhone Simulator and have a version of the app specifically compiled to run on the simulator.\n", "Q: How can I download WWDC 2013 videos straight to my iPad? I want to download some WWDC session videos to my iPad. I don't want to download them to iTunes, then transfer them to my iPad. Is there a way to download them directly?\n\nA: Not really a way to how to download them directly. In order to get in touch with your iPod, iPhone and iPad using a computer is actually iTunes since iTunes will sync the iOS Software.\nThis might help : https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4030410?start=30&tstart=0\nAnd some more here : http://www.copytrans.net/support/install-apps-to-iphone-ipad-and-ipod-touch-without-itunes/\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-ways-to-sync-music-to-your-iphone-without-itunes/\n", "Q: Time machine full restore only shows \"complete backups\" I am doing a restore of a Time machine backup to a new hard drive. The latest backup was completed on Feb 1, but I was very surprised to see that OS X Installer restore utility only lets me restore from \"full backups\" and the latest full backup was done Jan 15.\nFirst, I thought every Time Machine backup was full backup. Time Machine never reported any errors or any indication it was not doing complete backups. What happened and how can I prevent this from happening in the future?\nSecond, once I have completed the restore of the full backup from Jan 15th, what is the proper procedure to update to the latest backup on Feb 1st. Can I just restore all the files in the user's home directory?\n\nA: It appears that you disabled backing up system files by dragging /System directory to ignore list. \"Full backup\" means that OS X files are also backed up. It seems that in your case they are not, so you cannot restore the system from this backup.\nYour way to go now is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the last time if you still can\n\n*Boot to Internet recovery if your Mac has it (if not, update EFI to get Internet recovery) or from disks that came with your Mac (if you have them)\n\n*Reformat the disk, keep \"Macintosh HD\" name\n\n*Install a fresh copy of OS using Internet recovery or disks\n\n*Internet Recovery will give you the same version of OS X as your Mac originally had. If it is not Mavericks, get Mavericks from the AppStore, make a bootable drive (google for it, it is easy), boot the drive, reformat the disk again and install fresh Mavericks.\n\n*On the last step of the installation you will be asked to migrate your files. Do that.\n\n\nThis way you will get a fresh copy of the system with all your files from the last backup.\n\nA: What I would do if I where you, and I had some time on my hand, is to run Migration Assistant. From there you can restore your account with all your information from your latest backup.\nHowever I should mention, the \"full backup\" thing—never heard of it, and I have used plenty of Time Machine restores, however the migration assistant approach is the best way to give your mac a fresh boost too, hence it doesn't load all the OS parts, only your home directory!\n\nA: I had a similar situation recently which I resolved in the following way - it's not pretty so I'm not sure it qualifies as the proper procedure but it worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install OS X on the target machine\n\n*(Re)Create a user with the same UID\n\n*Install patches / updates if necessary\n\n*Connect the Time Machine disk\n\n*Use rsync(1) or other symlink aware tool to copy from:\nTime machine volume/Backups.backupdb/hostname/Latest/volume name to your target volume.  \n\n\nYou can pick and choose the files below the 'Latest' folder if you only want to restore certain files - in my case I was only interested in the User folders.  \nMy command to copy the user folders was something like:\nrsync -avu --progress /Volumes/Time\\ Machine\\ II/Backups.backupdb/apollo/Latest/Mavericks/Users /\n\nAlternatively you could, as you've suggested install, restore from the available 'Full Backup' and then carry out the final step to restore the most recent 'incremental'.\nIn practice before all of that I actually checked and then duplicated the contents of 'Latest' onto a separate drive for safety but that does depend on you having spare storage.\n", "Q: How to automatically mount NFS shares on OS X I have a NFS server set up on my local LAN running on Arch Linux that I can connect to using OS X Mavericks by issuing the following command in the terminal:\nmount -t nfs -o resvport host:/srv/nfs4/users /mnt/host\n\nAs the NFS client is a MacBook Pro, I would like for it to automatically connect to the NFS server whenever I am home (and do nothing otherwise).

I'm using an iPhone for the first time and I found that I can't view the same file in different apps.\nI have have some PDF files added to Adobe Reader but I cant view them in a similar app that views PDF files. Same thing happens with songs, photos and videos.\nDoes it mean that I have to add the same files to all other apps again? If so, wouldn't that be duplicating the same files over and over again? \nIs there a way to add the files once and use it in all apps like in Android?\n\nA: Yes, you will need to add the file to all the apps. You should be able to use the system-implemented Open With option, but this requires the support of the app to transfer the file.\nDue to the iOS sandbox, the apps aren't able to access the files from another app — the file must be duplicated to the second app.\n", "Q: how long time to get approve for Apple Developer Program enrollment?

However every time I open up an existing file, or create a new one, in the 09 version, it automatically asks me if I want to upgrade this to the new version. To not upgrade one needs to click \"edit existing copy.\" But the problem is when you save it (which has to aways be as a copy) and then close the file, it seems to save it regardless in the new version, or certainly when re-opening this same file, all the hyper links and other goodies associated with the 09 version, are all gone. \nAs far as I'm concerned the 09 version is a way superior product. Therefore I figured the best way to go is to completely get rid of the new version and go back to the old one. \nIs this possible, and if so how can I go about doing this in a way that won't affect any of my files? I have them all backed up anyway, but just wanted to make sure before going this way and want to make sure I can go back to the 09 version without any major issues. \nMy 09 version was originally loaded in via disk by the way. Please advise if possible, thanks guys.  \n\nA: The Mac App Store updates to iWork should not have replaced the original iWork '09 apps. Simply delete the new apps and use the old ones.\nThe original apps should still be available under /Applications/iWork '09 as well as if you search for them in Spotlight. If you've deleted the older versions, you can use Time Machine or reinstall them from the retail CD.\n\nA: There is no way to. I tried just deleting the new one and a couple weeks later, it says you need to update. There was no other way of opening the file besides opening. And also, some of my files wouldn't open for school!!!

It's been really great, Safari seems much more stable overall and I barely miss it.\nBut every once in a while I stumble upon a site that requires flash (mostly YouTube videos, which I thought wouldn't be a problem given that Google was supposed to be switching everything over to HTML5), so for those cases I have an Appescript that runs when triggered through an Alfred Workflow (with a hotkey). The script is as such:\ntell application \"Safari\"\n\n    set theURL to URL of current tab of window 1\n\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n\n    if windows ≠ {} then\n        make new tab at the end of window 1 with properties {URL:theURL}\n    else\n        make new window\n        set URL of active tab to theURL\n    end if\n    activate\n\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Safari\"\n\n    close current tab of window 1\n\nend tell\n\nThis usually runs perfectly, but I run into a weird problem whenever Chrome doesn't have an open window in the background. In these cases, Chrome will open a new (blank) window, and the script will stop right there. The third Tell statement,\n tell application \"Safari\"\n\n    close current tab of window 1\n\nend tell\n\nWill never run, leaving me with an open chrome window and an open safari window as well. It is only after I press the hotkey a second time, after the Chrome window is already open, that the Script will run it's course and open the page in chrome/close the tab in safari.\nAny ideas? I'm really confused by the fact the third tell statement won't run at all. If the Chrome window opened up blank but the safari tab still closed I would guess it was a simple error in the if/else statement, but the fact that the script seems to terminate is really stumping me on this one.\n\nA: Just because Safari and Chrome are running, doesn't mean that they have a window open. You can either test for open windows as Mark points out or simply issue the reopen command which opens a new window if one does not exist. \ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    if not (exists window 1) then reopen\n    -- insert your code \nend tell\n\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    if not (exists document 1) then reopen\n    -- insert your code \nend tell\n\nEDIT\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    if not (exists document 1) then return\n    set theURL to URL of current tab of window 1\n    close current tab of window 1\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    if not (exists window 1) then reopen\n    set URL of active tab of window 1 to theURL\nend tell\n\n\nA: Alfred may be shielding you from an error that occurs if Chrome is running  but does not have any windows open.\n\nGoogle Chrome got an error: Can’t set active tab to\n  \"http.....\".\n\nChange the lines\n  make new window\n  set URL of active tab to theURL\n\nto\nset theWindow to make new window\n\nset URL of active tab of theWindow to theURL\n\n", "Q: How Can I access Mac OS X Base System on Boot Screen?

I'm wondering what should I do with my Crucial M500 over my Macbook Pro with the last version of Mavericks.\nI've read that enabling TRIM also slow down a bit the writting/reading speed of the hard drive, but that it is also needed in order to avoid problems when the drive is 80% used.\nSome other people talk about the garbage collection saying that it should be enough.\nI've been checking some topics such as this one but I don't have it very clear yet... it seems enabling TRIM can be a bit risky.\nWhat would you guys suggest me to do?\nThanks!\n\nA: I'm not sure you are going to find a definitive answer. I have a MBP 2012 with with a Samsung 840 500GB that I keep pretty full. Testing with Black Magic, drive performance had cratered (around 150/50MB/sec R/W). I installed Trim Enabler, filled the drive by creating an encrypted disk volume, deleted the volume, and waited a couple of minutes. Black Magic was back to normal. That was a couple of months ago. However, I just ran BM and the numbers are back to ugly (150/50 R/W). I'm running Filevault. So clearly TRIM and GC isn't enough to maintain performance over time in some configurations.\nI also have 2009 MBP with an OWC 512GB w/o Trim enabled that is run with even less free space and the numbers today are as good as they were after initial install. So clearly GC is sufficient with some drives.\nOn the other hand, I didn't even notice that my notebook performance had regressed so unless you have an odd workload, maybe the answer doesn't make any practical difference in most cases.\n\nA: I found an excellent article on Toms Hardware which led to my personal definitive answer. It's possibly the most concise and understandable explanation of trim, and led me to decide to turn trim on. \nread here: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/macbook-pro-ssd-trim,3538.html\nA basic summary is this:\nHard drives don't know when a file is deleted so it continues to shuffle unnecessary data around wearing down hard drive use, and taking extra work by the controller. \nTrim lets the hard drive know right away when a file is deleted so it doesn't have to manage the data anymore. This is how you get a speedup. It also sounds like the extra commands sent to the drive only happen upon file deletion, and the speed tests in the article seem to show the hard drive is sped up in general.\nFor me, it's pretty clear that I want to save wear on my drive, and have better performance, so I'm turning on trim for OSX Mavricks. \n", "Q: HP Photosmart 5520 OS X 10.5.8 driver My mom bought a HP Photosmart 5520. Unfortunately, this printer is not compatible with her OS X 10.5.8 system.\nIs there a possibility we can get this working?\n\nA: I had the same issue with a HP Photosmart 5520 install diskette requiring (the 64bit architecture) Mountain Lion, Lion, etc.  You can start the install with the install diskette, it will soon just finish as a 5520 with NO Functionality. While an older version photosmart driver is the best bet, be sure it has a wireless functionality (e.g older Photosmarts C4400 etc. did not work) You will need a WIRELESS supporting driver, viz the D100 driver. The D100 driver wireless access not only lets the Mactook running Leopard but as well an iBook running Tiger and a 3rd Gen iPod touch work excellently.  The color printing is better than I need. It copies and does what I generally need. \nI use the HP 5520 in STANDALONE mode to provide printing service for all devices in wireless access.\nTo be sure here must be some functionality I do not get, given all the adverts about all the \"wonderful\" nuances in the product.  But most all straight forward printing and copying functionality I need for my iPod iOS4, MacBook Leopard and iBook G3 on Tiger, work excellently; they can see it as either a D100 or as a 5520. \n\nA: It looks like the drivers for the HP Photosmart 5520 require at least OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).\nIf she has an Intel Mac, she can most likely upgrade it to Snow Leopard for $20 (and from there, she can upgrade it further to OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) for free).\nIf she has a PowerPC Mac rather than an Intel Mac, then unfortunately she's stuck, since OS X 10.5 is the last version that supports PowerPC.\n\nIf she is stuck on PowerPC, you might have some luck setting up the printer as a \"similar\" model – that is, when you go to add the printer, select a different HP Photosmart model (assuming there are others listed). You likely won't be able to use every feature of the printer, but it could suffice depending on what your needs are.\nI did this before when I was in a similar situation (official printer drivers required a newer version of OS X than what I could install), and it worked well enough, in that I could still print basic documents (but couldn't scan or anything).\n", "Q: My book western digital not recognized on windows after time machine backup I have an MY BOOK from western digital I used it once for TIME MACHINE BACKUP, now under windows the hard drive is not recognized and theres no way to format it since it not recognized by windows, but it is recognized by mac, how can I format it in mac so it will be recognized in windows once again?\n\nA: If by 'not recognized' you mean not able to be mounted, this is because it has been formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) — HFS+.\nTo be able to read/write to it in Windows, you can format it to FAT.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility and connect your disk.\n\n*Select the disk and choose the Erase tab.\n\n*Select MS-DOS (FAT) as the format.\n\n\n*Click Erase.\nAll data on the disk will be lost.\n", "Q: how do i \"check\" my songs in Itunes I'm on PC with Microsoft Windows Vista.  iTunes was stuck for forced it to close.

I cannot drag the MAC OSX box (see below)\n\n\nA: The following seems to be the solution. I haven't tried it myself though.\nCopied from here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into Disk Utility and click on your main hard-drive that say either 256 GB, 517 GB, or 728GB.\n\n*Up the top, Click Partition.\n\n*Then down the bottom of Disk Utility, Click the + sign.\n\n*Now, select the new startup disk by clicking on it and then name it \"Macintosh HD (Lion Installed)\" or you can name it what ever you want.\n\n*Now size the new startup disk to the size you wanted your other startup disk with Lion installed on it to be and click apply.\n\n*After the process is done, Restart your mac and while it is starting up, hold down options.\n\n*You will see a grey screen for a second, but don't worry, it is normal.\n\n*Now, all your startup disks that you have will appear on the screen. Click Recovery HD.\n\n*You will see a grey screen for a second, but don't worry, it is normal.\n\n*Now, you will see the option to go into disk utility. Click on it and then click to continue.\n\n*When disk utility opens, click on your new startup disk on the left side of disk utility, now click on restore, now you will see 2 rectangular boxes that say source and destination.\n\n*Drag your startup disk that has Lion installed into the source box, then drag the new startup disk that you made 3 minutes ago into the destination box and click restore.\n\n*Once the progress is done, you can delete the old startup disk that had Lion install on it by going into your main startup disk that says 256 GB, 517 GB, or 728 GB and then clicking on Partition and then selecting that particular startup disk and then hitting delete on your keyboard.\n\n*(Last Step) Now, you are ready to restart you mac by clicking on the apple sign in the top left corner of the screen and clicking startup disk, now you will get the option of choosing which startup disk to startup your computer with. You just choose \"Macintosh HD (Lion Installed)\" or whatever your new startup disk is called and then click Restart.\nYour Computer will now restart. Now all of your files that were on your old startup disk with Lion installed will be on on this brand new fresh startup disk on your beautiful Mac.\n", "Q: Droid base and iPhone cable for charging? I just got an iPhone 5c.  I had a Droid.  I have several Droid charging cables.  The Lightening charging cable I got with my iPhone detaches on the other end to a USB port.  The Droid charging \"bases\"/wall outlets have USB ports.  Can I recharge my iPhone 5 by plugging the Apple Lightning cable into a Droid base?\n\nA: In most cases yes you can. \nBut if the charger is too weak (less than 1 amps), it will charge your iPhone more slowly than the original charger. \n", "Q: Distinctive slowdown across browsers on 10.9.1 I've noticed a strange pattern of delays when trying to fetch websites; the behavior seems extremely distinctive, and is easy for me to reproduce so I'm fairly confident of most of the details below. I'm hoping someone will recognize it, or be able to work it out.\n\n\n*\n\n*The length of delay seems to increase with the amount of time since restarting my computer, as far as I can tell without bound. This is less carefully tested than the other points, but it I am confident that restarting fixes the problem and that it rarely appears within the first few hours after restarting (and seems manageable for a lot longer than that).\n\n*The delay appears in any of Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.\n\n*curl works fine normally. But while any of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox is loading a page, curl will experience large delays. Closing the browser will immediately cause all of the running curl jobs to finish successfully (for example, I can start up 5 instances of curl fetching different websites, all of which will halt at the progress bar showing no progress; closing Chrome will cause all of the jobs to immediately finish).\n\n*The delay for curl is substantially smaller than the delay for websites, even when it exists. Right now it is on the order of 15 seconds, because I haven't restarted in a while in the hopes of debugging it. A website will take much longer than this, perhaps 15 seconds while \"waiting for www.---.com\" followed by comparable lengths of time waiting for others.\n\n*Latencies (as reported by ping) don't increase during problems.\n\n*While curl is experience delays, different curl jobs will finish at the same time. That is, they will all hang for a long time, then all stop hanging at the same moment (and so finish at roughly the same time, on the scale of the 15+ seconds for which they are hanging). Sometimes this happens in browsers, but not reliably (which I think might be because a browser has several opportunities to hang before actually finishing loading the page). After the curl jobs finish, immediately restarting them results in them hanging in exactly the same way, so it's not that the problem has cleared up (at least not for very long).\n\n*The delay is quite varied across web pages. I haven't done a very detailed survey (that will be the next step I guess). \n\n*when it hangs, curl -v hangs at the progress bar with no data transmitted.\n\n*While loading pages in Chrome, most of the time is spent \"waiting for\" CDNs and third party services.\n\n*Often Chrome will be displaying a blank screen, and pressing \"Stop\" will cause the page to render (with most but not all of the assets loaded). I assume this is related to the last point, and is just a behavior of chrome that appears when we have this long delay, rather than being closely related to the problem. \n\n*The delay appears when connected to many different wireless networks with different performance characteristics (e.g. a 50mbps line). I haven't tried wired networks, though I presume it wouldn't matter.\n\n*Similarly a different DNS makes no difference (which isn't surprising given that ping is always fine).\n\n*I observe the same behavior under very different levels of stress on the system. For example, right now I have 3 / 8 GB of memory free.\n\nA: As a additional debug method I would try to create a new system user and see if the problem persists.\nIn the past I have similar problems after installing VPN software. Even using the uninstaller the system was sluggish.\nThe truth is, us power users, usually abuse the OS installing thinking tools, browser extensions, preferences panes, command line tools... Some are beta or even alpha.\nIf this is your case installing a fresh system on a empty drive is probably the best solution.\n\nA: The issue is a failure of the Cisco VPN client, as described here, and it was fixed by running sudo /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/websecurity_uninstall.sh. \nThis had failed to occur to me because I hadn't used the client recently when the problem emerged. But looking through the console quickly revealed an absurd number of error messages that quickly identified the culprit.\n\nA: I have had experiences like this and these are what I found to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clearing memory (RAM)\n\n*Clearing cache in affected browsers\n\n*Reinstalling browsers\n\n*Cleaning/replacing RAM\n\n", "Q: iPhone 5s slow on wifi I have an iPhone 5s that was bought several months ago.

It will not show you this via the user interface.\nYou can delete it by using iexplorer (which is awesome). \nPlug in your iPad/iPhone device\nOpen the program (windows or Mac)\nClick on media\nThe delete \"PhotoData\", \"Photo StreamsData\".\nYou should only do this if you have already removed all your photos from the device and backed them up and not concerned about losing anything.\n\nA: Firstly, be aware that the phone can sometimes take a while to update free space after deleting large items. I have often wondered whether iOS is making the user experience a bit 'nicer' by reporting the item deleted instantly, while doing the actual deleting in the background. Or perhaps its just the time taken to update databases used to record/report used/free space. In any case, try giving it a few minutes (maybe an hour) and see if its 'settled down'.\nNext up, in the Photos app, check the albums 'tab'. Is the camera roll reporting entirely empty? Are there any other albums? A 'full' Photo Stream (1000 photos) might take 1-1.5 GB, the photos in the camera roll (presumably 0) are perhaps 2MB each (depends on device). You can check these usage in the Settings app (General -> Usage -> Photos & Camera).\nFinally, plug the phone into your computer, and open up an app like Apple's Image Capture or whatever you use on Windows/Linux to import photos from a camera. Check that there's actually no photos in the 'camera' that is your iPad. After clearing out my phone, I found a bunch of small, unreadable movie files and a few photos left over in this app. I don't know how or why, given the iPhone wasn't showing them, but they were clearly taking up space. You may have somehow ended up with a lot of these.\n\nA: If the you cannot delete those photo on iPad, use a third party software like iFunBox to delete all photo data on computer, this will work and without the need of Jailbreak. Sometime iPad/iPhone take some time to delete data, like when I delete a huge game, the usage setting will show the app is deleted by it is actually still erasing the data in the background.\n", "Q: Is there an app that shows iPhone call alerts on iPad?

This seems so simple, yet there doesn't seem to be anything in the App Store, leading me to believe it's not possible.\n\nA: As you figured out yourself, apps allowed on the AppStore can't do that.\nWorst, I'm not even sure something like that exist for jailbroken iDevices, since I did not find things like that. \nAlso related : iPhone ring notification on the computer. \n", "Q: How can I fix my ID3 tags without confusing iTunes? I'm planning to use TagScanner to clean up the ID3 tags for my music (though I'd be happy to use an alternative if it addressed the problem below). Unfortunately, doing so will change the files out from under iTunes. One thing that worries me is that iTunes seems to like to keep my music in folders reflecting the artist's name. \nOnce TagScanner has fixed the tags some files will be in a folder that's inconsistent with what one would expect based on the tags. I'd also like to make sure that iTunes' view of of the music reflects the updated information so that, for example, I can search for files using the repaired ID3 tags.\nHow can I spruce up my music files without breaking iTunes?\n\nA: One idea would be to run TagScanner, then create a new iTunes library: \n\n\n*\n\n*Hold Option while starting iTunes.\n\n*Click \"Create new\" library. Choose its destination ~/Music and name it.\n\n*In the new library, open Preferences and navigate to Advanced.\n\n*Make sure that \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library\" is checked.\n\n*Import all the TagScanner'd music files into your new library. \n\n\niTunes will create a new folder/sub-folder [artist/album] hierarchy based on the new ID3 information, and nothing would be broken. If everything looks the way you want it to, delete the old library. Here's how to delete the old library (this edit is in response to your comment below): delete the entire /iTunes folder and all its contents. You'll notice that when you make a new library, you get a new folder in ~/Music. For example, ~/Music/Nathans_Library. That folder isn't where the iTunes application lives, so it's fine to wipe out the whole thing. \n(It's handy to know this, because it means you can store your iTunes library wherever you want to. For example, at work I archive loads of audio tracks in an iTunes library on a server. That way, my co-workers can access it if they need to, and our ITS department can back it up more easily.)\nOne tip for albums featuring guest appearances: Set the album artist, because iTunes looks at \"Taylor Swift\" and \"Taylor Swift feat. Tim McGraw\" as two separate artists, so make sure to set the album artist to \"Taylor Swift\". iTunes will use the album artist field to make the organizational folder hierarchy, so your tracks will stay grouped together in the file system as well as in iTunes.\nCaveat: Following this approach might mean losing your personal metadata like play count, rating, date last played, etc. I'm not sure though. \nDefinitely back up your entire iTunes library before trying anything like this; you never know what might cause you to need a \"do-over\".\n\nA: MusicBrainz's documentation for their tag fixer, Picard, directly addresses how to avoid confusing iTunes--of course you have to be willing to use MusicBrainz, not TagScanner, to get much value out of this.\n\nA: You could just use a little java application called unicode rewriter.\nHere's the link, it can convert ID3 Tags into different format that can be read correctly for iTunes.\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/unicoderewriter/\n", "Q: Root crontab won't save I'm trying to add a crontab entry to my root user's crontab. I'm able to add an entry without issue to my regular user's crontab, but when I su to root user and try adding a crontab entry it does not save the entry. \nThe process I'm going through is:\n$sudo su\n$crontab -e\n# write out my crontab entry and then :wq to write and quit vi\n$crontab -l\ncrontab: no crontab for root\n\nI've also tried exiting vi using wq! and it still will not save the entry. \nThe entry that I'm entering is:\n* * * * * /sayhi.sh\n\nsayhi.sh is a simple shell script I'm using to try to verify that the cron job is running. \nIs there something different I need to do if I'm trying to create a crontab entry for root? I've been looking around and I haven't seen anything about crontab that's particular to the root user. \nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nA: Your commands should actually work, however it's not as I would do it.\nInstead try :-\nsudo crontab -e -u root\n\nthen to list :-\nsudo crontab -l -u root\n\nAs a general rule I go to a great deal of trouble to never run a root shell. When I do I use sudo -s rather than sudo su.\nWhen you exit from vi you should see two lines :-\ncrontab: no crontab for root - using an empty one\ncrontab: installing new crontab\n\nIf you don't get those two lines you have serious troubles. If you do and then the list command doesn't show anything I would suspect permission troubles.\nI also wouldn't use your example line as you are asking the system to run \"sayhi.sh\" once a minute all day, every day. I also wonder about the path \"/sayhi.sh\" - do you really have the script right up the top of your boot drive? That's not a good idea either or do you perhaps mean \"~/sayhi.sh\" which in this case would be in roots home directory (usually /var/root) or do you mean your home directory. In crontab files it's best to explicitly code the entire path, regardless.\nYou do also realise that tany output of the cron job will not go to any terminal but will instead be emailed to root (by default).\nIf you want to check that cron is running tasks a simple\n*/5 * * * *   echo \"CRON\" > /Users/myname/.cronout\n\nwill do that (the first field runs the task a much more reasonable every 5 minutes).\nThe crontabs themselves are stored in /usr/lib/cron/tabs. /usr/lib/cron is actually a link to /var/at and if you go there you will find the tabs directory and also the cron.deny file. Check that nobody has added root to that and if you still have no joy then you might try :\necho > /var/at/tabs/root\n\nwhich should create an empty file that you might then be able to edit.\n\nA: I was having the same problem. Here is what worked for me (and by \"worked\" I mean I was able to get a cron job to run as root):\nsudo bash -login            # su always tries to force me to change my password >:[\nvi /usr/lib/cron/tabs/root  # Just edit it directly\n\nchmod 600 /usr/lib/cron/tabs/root\n\nThe jobs you put there will run, but crontab -e still doesn't work, even after creating the crontab. \n", "Q: Can Mavericks Spaces support 3 windows spanned across 2 displays? Is it possible to have a 3-screen Space across two displays such that you can swipe to toggle between seeing displays 1 & 2 or 2 & 3?\n\nA: Yes.\nIn Mavericks, each space (or full-screen application) can be assigned to any screen, and the 4-finger-swipe gesture will slide between spaces/apps on that screen only.\nYou can see this quite clearly if you open up Mission Control with multiple monitors; each monitor's spaces/apps are shown across the top of said monitor.\nSo, for example, you could put Desktop 1 and Desktop 2 on your left monitor, Desktop 3 on your right monitor. Swiping on your left monitor would change between Desktops 1 & 2, while the right monitor would remain on Desktop 3.\n", "Q: Can my iPad open iPhone apps using the iPhone 5 form factor?

I'm doing this hack job where I have routed a cell phone's GPRS modem over to a local PTY. The proprietary debug software actually routes the modem over TCP, I then use socat to route it to a PTY (planning on using PPPD, which needs a serial terminal to connect to AFAIK).\nI plan on establishing a PPP connection over that PTY (maybe PPPD, or any other solutions?)\nHowever, even if I establish this PPP connection, I have no idea how to make it effective over the OS (so it doesn't use the WIFI or any other configured options such as Ethernet).

It does this even when you edit plain text documents.  Is there a way to prevent this new behavior in Mavericks?\n\nA: This is not just TextEdit, it's Mavericks.\nUnder System Preferences > Keyboard, you can change the quotation marks.\nGo to the 'Text' sub-menu.  On the right-hand side of the box, uncheck the \"Use smart quotes and dashes\" checkbox.\n\nA: If you already unchecked System Preferences > Keyboard > Text > Use smart quotes and dashes. \nThere's also a checkmark on TextEdit > Preferences > \"Smart quotes\" (I don't know the translation but it something like that).\nBe sure to uncheck that one too.\n\nA: The following procedure worked for me:\nIn TextEdit select all your text by pressing ⌘ Cmd-A and then go to Edit > Substitutions and uncheck Smart Quotes. Make sure Smart Quotes is not active and it should be solved.\n\nA: I tried unchecking the Smart quotes option in both the MAC system preferences system preferences -> keyboard -> text tab untick the use smart quotes and dashes option and in textedit app preferences at textedit -> preferences -> uncheck smart quotes and dashes in rich text documents only option\nBut the issue was still not resolved for me. When I type single quote or double quote in rich text document then it is converted to curly quote. For example, if I do a search using command+F for the single quote then it will not find any.\nThe only way I was able to solve this in my MAC is that I need to use ctrl key when typing either single quote or double quote. For example, when typing single quote I need to type ctrl + singlequote and when typing double quote I need to type ctrl + shift + doublequote\nI am using MAC OS Catalina and rich text document, hope someone can point to a permanent fix for this rather than remembering the keyboard shortcut each time.\n\nA: It appears that by default, TextEdit (and other apps) inherit from the preferences -> keyboard setting.\nBut they only inherit from it at start time.  So you can change it in preferences -> keyboard, then restart you app.\nOr if you specify it within the apps Edit menu -> Substitutions -> Smart quotes then it appears to override whatever the keyboard preference is (permanently) but for just that app.  So they both work.\n", "Q: iMac mid 2011 RAM upgrade compatability Is this RAM going to be compatible with a mid 2011 iMac 21.5\"?\n\nA: The RAM you are pointing are DIMM.

Which CPU is better? I need a new Macbook Pro and am comparing the 13 inch Retina 2.6GHz with the 15 inch Retina 2.0GHz. \nI understand that 2.6GHz is faster than 2.0GHz but how does CPU performance compare between the two models with regards to Turbo Boost? \nThe 13 inch boosts up to 3.1GHz whereas the 15 inch boosts to 3.2Ghz.\nMy old MacBook didn't have Turbo boost and I use photo and video editing software. \nI'd prefer the bigger screen but am mindful of cost.\n\nA: It's quite simple from my perspective - The 15 inch CPU is superior in all respects over the 13 inch CPU:\n\n\n*\n\n*2.0GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache\n\n*2.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz) with 3MB shared L3 cache\n\n\nTurbo Boost engages for operations where only one core is active. Starting at a lower GHz saves energy and battery and as long as the CPU can boost to a faster top level than a competing CPU - you get the best of both worlds - fuel efficiency at idle and top speed when needed.\nSo, for a simple task where the computer is doing one thing only - you would expect the 13 inch to ramp one core up to 3.1 GHz whereas the 15 inch would ramp up to 3.2 GHz. Bigger is better for that task. Plus a larger L3 cache will make some switching between tasks more efficient on the 15 inch model.\nNow, if you have video processing or a mixed workload where tons of compute is waiting for the CPU. You have two cores running at 2.66 or 5.32 GHz of theoretical throughput compared to 4 cores at 2.0 or 8.00 GHz of throughput. Again, no task scales perfectly, but even with 10% overhead, the quad core processor wins. It would have to be a bizarre benchmark to show the dual core i5 out perform the quad core i7 for any task that engages multiple cores.\nIf you want another opinion, I would recommend this nice article by Marco Arment on trying to calculate which Mac Pro CPU choice works for various budgets and tasks:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.marco.org/2013/11/26/new-mac-pro-cpus\nIn it, he doesn't explain why he feels the 15 inch MacBook Pro is so far superior to the 13 inch MacBook Pro and simply states it as fact. I generally agree with that due experience and seeing benchmarks/reviews I trust. My feeling is the current 15 inch logic board and supporting components are faster and of better specifications than what is put into the 13 inch model. If you can swing the cost and live with (or prefer) the larger physical size, get the 15 inch model. It's an excellent workstation in a portable form factor. For many tasks it benchmarks as fast as an iMac and even the new Mac Pro. \n\nPersonal note: The base $1299 13 inch model is no slouch - I work from one almost exclusively the last year and I'm never really waiting for it in practice. If you need to pinch pennies on the CPU, I'd con side any of the retina 13 inch models if it means you can afford AppleCare, an external monitor plus backup drive(s) and whatever software you need to be productive. Rather than invest in tons of extra CPU cycles that you may not really use or need to work day in and day out. \n\nA: The MBP 13\" has a dual-core CPU, the MBP 15\" has a quad-core CPU.\nThe difference in performance between dual-core and quad-core processors is hard to predict.\nQuad-core CPUs aren't twice as fast as a dual-core CPUs since not every application takes advantage of multiple cores.\nMore heavy applications like video editing software or browsers like Google Crome are optimised to use multiple cores.\nIn overall experience (if not always) the quad core processor will be faster, but it really comes down to what you do with your system to make out if the cost is worth it or not.\n", "Q: Workaround for Mavericks Bluetooth/Wi-Fi interference? I have this problem: I normally have Bluetooth enabled so I can make use of my speaker system and Magic Trackpad on my mid-2012 11\" MacBook Air (2.0 GHz i7, 8GB).  \nHowever, when it's enabled, Wi-Fi association does not complete well, either on boot or wake from sleep.  In my case, the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar oscillates a bit and generally gives up.  Clicking the icon again may or may not show my network; if it does, I can click it and it will usually associate, though occasionally it complains that association failed.  This happens on all networks I regularly use—one, a Buffalo AP, the other, a Linksys.\nIf I turn Bluetooth off, I can associate just as quickly as I ever have with no issues.  I generally don't even see it trying to associate; it's done before I'm logged in.\nThis appears to be a Mavericks problem, as the folks in the linked Apple discussion are speculating.  I know I never had it under ML.  Unfortunately, I don't know exactly when I started having the issue, but it seems like it became prevalent around the time I bought the Magic Trackpad.  This seems odd, though, since the Trackpad is tens of miles away on one of the networks I'm having issues with.\nIs there a workaround that would allow me to leave Bluetooth enabled so I can much more easily use my Trackpad?\n\nA: After digging in the aforementioned Apple discussion, I discovered at one point that an Apple technician recommended to one of the participants that they should remove their com.apple.Bluetooth property list.  I did so:\n$ sudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist \n\nand rebooted.  When the reboot was complete, Wi-Fi was working flawlessly with Bluetooth on.  I lost pairings to all my Bluetooth devices except my Magic Trackpad.  I added back my speakers and all remains well 24+ hours later.\nUPDATE: Adding my portable speaker seems to have been the straw that broke the camel's back.  Had to repeat these steps and then leave it unpaired to keep Wi-Fi working.\n\nA: I've struggled with this problem for 2,5 days (MBPr, magic mouse). My wifi signal dropped on occasion. When I put my MBPr close to the Airport Extreme (so when the wifi signal was very strong), this problem did not occur. Deleting the Bluetooth prefs file made no difference. I found out eventually that Bluetooth interfered with the wifi signal. The solution: use 5Ghz only for your Wifi. Bluetooth uses 2.4 Ghz so no interference anymore.

Phone GV Extension worked well on my iPhone 4S running 5.x (and maybe 6.x), although my iPhone seemed to be a bit less stable (reboot/crashes) in jailbroken mode.\n\nA: This is not possible in 2014 and neither is it possible in fall of 2019.\nUnless there’s an API or other way to script this, you might need to use a mac or other python enabled tool to automate this.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I initiate a Google Voice phone call from the command line?\n\nA: I just found Call on GV Pro (jailbreak needed) that works on iOS 7.1.2\n", "Q: Memory test that fails with a different address each time I had problems (strange patterns on the display and reboots) with my Late 2011 Macbook Pro, so I ran Apple Hardware Test on my computer, and it found memory errors. The thing is that every time  I run the AHT, the error is slightly different. The first time, I got:\n\n4MEM/62/40000000: 0x83a65498\n\nThe second time:\n\n4MEM/62/40000000: 0x836dc298\n\nI then swapped my two memory sticks and got this error:\n\n4MEM/62/40000000: 0x842e1198\n\nI am assuming that the hex number is the address where the test fails…\nIt always takes about 13.5 minutes of tests for the error to appear.

It may be the pattern being written to some address when the failure occurred.\nThe field where you have a value of 62 seems to be the only one that varies significantly. It may be that this value represents the address to some very course degree (eg. maybe 1-64 could represent one DIMM and 65-128 the other; or maybe odd numbers vs even numbers).\nIt would be nice if Apple would document these very basic and useful error code formats.\n", "Q: How can I tell who posted a photo in a shared iCloud photo stream?

But, if possible, I would like to have also a shortcut for command+W.\n\nA: I think my answer to your other question largely applies here too, but to specifically answer this:\nIf you tick the checkbox in the TotalTerminal preferences to show icon in Status Menu,  it should allow you to ⌘-w and reactivate without having to relaunch. You might also be running into issues with it seemingly not reactivating due to conflicting shortcuts in various applications, in which case I recommend trying a modifier-only \"hotkey\". ⌥ + ⌥ seems to work well.\n", "Q: Will a MacBook with its lid closed (asleep) restart at the scheduled time?

Ideally I'd like a 21\" version of the Thunderbolt Cinema Display but such a beast does not exist.\nIs it possible to use a 21\" iMac as an external monitor from a MacBook Pro via Thunderbolt?\nThanks.\n\nA: The answer is sometimes yes.

On a fresh Mavericks, I installed Xcode via the App store (accepted license agreement and enabled developer mode). After that, Command Line Tools (CLT) are found (checked via xcode-select -p). Installing Homebrew as explained on their webpage (ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)\") will result in the request to install the CLT. Why do I have to install them? I thought they are installed together with Xcode.\n\nA: You have to install them because, starting with version 4.3, Xcode is released as a sandboxed, single app bundle.\nBefore that, Xcode was distributed as an installer called Install Xcode.app. The installer had access to the whole filesystem and created a /Developer directory, where frameworks and additional tools where placed, and installed the command line tools in /usr/bin.\nThis is no longer the case. Apple chose to make XCode a standard Mac App Store app that installs in /Applications and requires user intervention to install any additional components outside the bundle container.\n\nA: The command line tools are not installed as part of Xcode. xcode-select does not prove the existence of the command line tools. You have to install them separately.\n", "Q: Color issues when waking up MBA connected to Apple Thunderbolt Display I haven't got the faintest idea what is causing this issue, but hopefully somebody here has experienced it before.\nWhen I haven't used my computer for a while I decide to wake it up from sleep by pressing a random button on my external keyboard. I have it set up so that the MBA itself is closed, i.e. the Thunderbolt Display is the only screen I am using.\nThe computer always wakes up immediately and most of the times it works just as expected, but sometimes the color of the display is shifted to a quite prominent purplish tone. When this happens I open and close the lid of the laptop, which immediately solves the problem, but I'm curious as to why the problem exists in the first place.\nIt started happening a few weeks ago and I have been using the MBA with the TB display since summer 2012.\n\nThank you in advance.\nEDIT: Just took a screenshot which after opening and closing the lid doesn't show any discoloration, which leads me to believe this is a hardware issue.

I have an old Tangerine iMac G3 in nice condition, I installed a clean copy of OS 9 on it and I can run the \"iMac Demo Summer 1998\" interactive demo which is neat.\nI'd like to install OS X (Tiger) on it.  (I know it will work because it was running Tiger when I got it.)\nHowever, after installing OS X, I know the OS 9 interface will be gone for good, and I probably won't be able to run the old demo anymore.\nMy question is, can you partition the hard drive in the iMac so I have one OS 9 partition that is completely separate from the OS X partition, so I can startup which ever OS I want to show off to my geeky friends?\nThx!\n\nA: Yes. My old notes had me putting OS 9 on the first partition but I'm not sure if that's compulsory or just recommended.\nThen in OS 9 you have control panel to choose your startup disk and in OS X you have a system preference.\nIn fact it's technically possible to have both OS 9 and OS X installed on the same partition. Install OS X first and then OS 9. You may find later versions of OS X will have trouble blessing the OS 9 folder if it is in the same partition but it certainly worked up till 10.4\nCheck out this old Apple tech note: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1732 \n", "Q: Something like MHDDFS for OS X?

So, I'm willing to wipe the entire thing BUT as a software developer I've been working on a huge project on my own that never wanted to be anywhere outside my domain (hohoho!) , now I know it was a pretty dumb idea, because s**t happens.

Download it, install it on your windows partition, restart your computer, access Windows once again, open MacDrive and from there you can access your MacHD partition, if it's corrupt it will tempt you to fix it, you might as well try to, you never know, but if things don't go the way you wanted well just open the disk and try to reach for your most desired files!

For example I can play a YouTube video and listen to it with head phones, while recording the sound output. All that works fine, the problem comes when I click record in Audacity. It records the sound, but it is adding an echo or reverb which distorts the sound, especially the bass drum in techno music. How do I turn this echo/reverb off?\nBtw, if I listen to the music with my headphones, through Audacity, but I don't click record, the sound is great. The problem comes when I begin to record.\n\nA: I had same problem just fixed it, so assuming you are trying to record audio from Sound Card.

Is there an application to preview markdown files (.md files) on OSX (for instance on Maverick)?\n\nA: The perfect preview tool for Markdown is Marked 2 which gives a preview of your Markdown and watches the file so that every time you save in an editor your preview is updated.\nIt also supports custom pre-processors so you can use extra markup such as critic, custom CSS so you can have a preview that looks however you wish and tools to export the result in a variety of formats. It can even track an entire folder and start previewing a different file when you start to edit it.\nTaken together all that means that you can write your Markdown in any editor you like and preview and output easily.\nYou might want to think about installing qlmarkdown which gives you the ability to preview MarkDown files properly in the Finder using QuickLook.\n\nA: If you would like markdown to be read with Quick Look, you can use QLMarkdown.\nYou can install it either by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the QLMarkdown.qlgenerator in either ~/Library/QuickLook (current user) or /Library/QuickLook (all users).\n\n*Using Homebrew, run brew cask install qlmarkdown in the Terminal\n\n\nAfter that, you should be able to view markdown files.\n\nA: The superuser question, Markdown Live Preview Editor?, provides a wealth of options:\n\n*\n\n*BBEdit\n\n*TextMate\n\n*Mou\n\n*Marked\n\n*MarkdownLive\n\n*Atom\n\n*Marked 2\n\n*MacDown\nIn additional to those, you can install a markdown QuickLook plugin for Finder based previews.\nMarkdownLive\n\nMou\n\nMarked 2\n\n\nA: If you are using sublimetext, then you can use MARKDOWN PREVIEW  package from package manager.\nIt has multiple styles like GITHUB, HTML and etc.\nhttps://www.sublimetext.com\nhttps://facelessuser.github.io/MarkdownPreview/\n\nA: There is also Markoff (App Store, GitHub), a pure viewer for CommonMark files:\n\n\nA: If you'd rather not install a new application, there are browser extensions for this.

Now you can add that as one of the criteria you're using to search, along with Name, Kind, etc. There are some other interesting photography-related criteria in the list: Exposure Time, F-number, ISO speed, etc.\nHere's why it won't help:\nIn order for Spotlight to find files using attributes like Rating, some importer has to first provide data for that attribute to Spotlight. None of Apple's own photo storage applications (iPhoto, Aperture, Photos) seem to provide an importer that does this, and unless your favorite photo app does provide that data, Spotlight won't have any data in its index to search for.\n\nA: I believe what you're looking for is: Size: [size in bytes]. \nYou can augment this by using >, <, <=, >=.\nFor example, I was able to search for all files smaller than 5K by entering Size:<5000.\nAdditionally, the keyword for star-rating is Rating.\nThe only strangeness I noticed was not being able to search by size in anything other than bytes.\n", "Q: How to disable the warning when saving names that begin with a dot?

Just uncheck \"Wake for Wifi Access\" in the System Preferences under Energy Saver, Power Adapter. \nWhen it's checked, it means that your computer disconnects from the network when you're computer's not awake. \n\nA: Use either caffeinate or something like wimoweh\n\nA: Had the same problem in my Macbook(15\") pro running 10.9.4.\nI wanted my Mac to be locked while I was away (so configured hot corners) but at the same time did not want it to sleep (irrespective of whether it is connected to power or not) so that my wifi will be \"ON\" always for my jabber & mails. So here's what I did to prevent Mac from sleeping:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Run sudo pmset -a sleep 0\nExplanation of the command:\n\n\n*\n\n*pmset command is to manipulate power management settings. \n\n*-a specifies that the setting applies for all conditions (power & battery)\n\n*sleep configure system sleep timer\n\n*0 to disable\nCheck out man pmset for more information.\n\nA: I have a Mac Book Pro running 10.9.5.  To keep it from sleeping when I locked the screen, I changed the Energy Saver settings for Power Adapter, I checked \"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\" and I unchecked \"Wake for network access\".\n\nA: You can use InsomniaX for that.\nWith that, you can prevent your mac from sleeping, wether it's idle sleep or even when you close the lid.\n\nA: I found a solution that works for my needs: As it turns out, I should not lock the screen, but instead start the screensaver, and require the screensaver to immediately require a password.\nI created a 'Start Screensaver' service with Automator, and then selected a keyboard shortcut for that service under Settings->Keyboard->Shortcuts->Services.\n\nA: I went to System Preferences > Energy Saver and unchecked Enabled Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter.\n\nA: Install SmartSleep(from Apple Store) with Insomnia plugin and your problem should be solved.

I have seen high scores of 999,999  on Flappy Bird as well as many other impossible high scores on games such as Temple Run, etc., on iPhone and iPad.\nHow do people hack these games so easily when they cannot see the source code?  It seems like they know the source code of the game, which makes them able to manipulate the game file so easily.  I don't understand how this happens given that the Apple iPhone is sandboxed, unlike Android.\n\nA: iOS applications store their data in files that are available from a computer in two easily-accessible ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inside an iTunes backup\n\n*Via a MobileDevice-framework-based tool such as iExplorer\nIn my experience, game save data is stored in a fairly ordinary property list file that is manipulable via the plutil tool.  The data can be restored and replaced without any code knowledge.  From there it's a simple matter of how much the app trusts its save data.\nFor an example of how this can be used not just for high scores, but to cheat at a game, see the Nimble Quest iOS Trainer, which is itself MobileDevice-framework-based.\n(The MobileDevice framework is an Apple private framework created for iOS device access, which has been reverse-engineered to enable the creation of iOS device tools not available from Apple.)\n\nA: Some games communicate with their backend server un-encrypted, in plain text. If you route the traffic through a proxy like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite you can see and manipulate the traffic.\nI have seen games that send the answers with the question to the iPhone. In this scenario I could highlight the correct answers. As a result you can always score 100%. Other games send the scores to the server. In that case you can just add a few zero's to your score when submitting it.\nThen there are games that store your scores on the phone as zigg describes. These scores are stored in a user readable and writable area and can therefore be manipulated. This is of course only stored on the phone, but you can show off to your friends by flashing your phone.\n\nA: Its very simple to hack games even clash of clans almost all the games i have are hacked\n", "Q: Taps vs formulas The official site says: \n\nA tap is homebrew-speak for a git repository containing extra\n  formulae.\n\nBut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why are taps kept separately from regular formulae?  Why use the distinction at all?\n\n*What are the implications of installing software from taps versus\nregular formulae?  \n\n\nI presume brew uses the distinction for a reason, and since they warn the user about it, I would like to know why.\n\nA: \nWhy are taps kept separately from regular formulae? Why use the distinction at all?\n\nTaps are repositories that contain formulae. All formulae, even 'regular formulae' are stored in a tap. The default tap is mxcl/master. However, 'taps' usually refer to third-party taps.\nThird-party taps contain formulae that are managed by a third-party, and therefore aren't included in the default since they can be updated at any time by the author.\nTechnically, there is no distinction between regular formulae and taps since regular formulae are in a tap, but that tap is pre-added.\n\nWhat are the implications of installing software from taps versus regular formulae?\n\nThe formulae in taps aren't verified by Homebrew, and could contain anything. Always exercise caution and verify that the tap is from a legitimate source. In essence, core non-tap formulae are installed on a wider user base and have not only eyes from the maintainers of homebrew watching over them, but crowd sourced eyes which make compromised code less likely to be installed from formulae.\n", "Q: Microsoft Remote Desktop Server for OS X Is there any solution that would allow ke to run a Terminal Services or RDP server on my Mac?\nI'd like to be able to access my Mac via Microsoft's Remote Desktop application\nI am aware of Screen Sharing fir OS X\nAlso, if there is no specific way to do this, is there any way to use the linux xrdp package on OS X?\n\nA: On this site are listed 5 possible programs to do this, as native this isn't possible.\nExplained are:\n\n\n*\n\n*TeamViewer\n\n*LogMeIn (free)\n\n*Real VNC\n\n*Vine Server\n\n*Remote Management\n\n\nNote, LogMeIn does not have a free version anymore.\n\nA: There is now iRAPP and iRAPP Terminal Server from coderebel.com - \nhttp://www.coderebel.com/products/irapp\nhttp://www.coderebel.com/products/irapp-terminal-server\n", "Q: Mac OS word delimiter character settings I seem to remember seeing a tip once where there was a setting in System Preferences where you can define \"programming\" as a language or something so that double-clicking on a hyphenated word selects the entire word, hyphen and all.\nI did this on my older MBP and now can't remember how to do it for my new one (10.9.1)\n\nA: There's a setting that might be what you're referring to:\nOS X Preferences > Language & Region > Region > Americas > United States (Computer) \n\nA: Alas the 'Computer' language has been foolishly removed from the choices in macOS.\nThat ':' is considered part of a word astounds me.\n", "Q: How do I sort a Numbers' table using data from another table? So, I've got this data set coming from questionnaires. I created one table per question, questionnaires in rows, answers in columns, and everything is fine and dandy, but now I have this situation where the questionnaires pertain to a number of different groups. So I created a table associating the ID of the questionnaires with their group, and then I sorted it and I've got a nice aggregated view of questionnaires' IDs grouped together depending on their group.\nNow I'd like to sort all my other tables' rows accordingly.

I've tried quite a few settings and haven't been able to get it to display anything better than 3840*2160 14hz, while I've ready about quite a few people that have their MacBook Pros working with the Seiki 4K pretty easily.\nSo I ask: what exactly are your settings with yours or how do I get mine to work?\nUsing a Belkin Thunderbolt-HDMI adapter (and have tried plain HDMI as well), have SwitchResX installed (but haven't gotten 3840*2160-30HZ to be accepted by the computer) with an Intel HD 4000 graphics card.\n\nA: You will need an active adapter that converts the DisplayPort 1.1 signal coming from your Thunderbolt port to an HDMI 1.4 Signal. The UltraAV Mini DisplayPort 1.1 to HDMI 1.4 Active Adapter for example. The regular (passive) adapters will not give you the HDMI 1.4 that is required for your resolution.\nAlso, make sure your HDMI cable is High Speed certified (sometimes it's called a Category 2 cable), and that you use the right resolution, refresh rate and color depth.\nHDMI resolutions\nHDMI Standard    1.3a                 1.4                   2.0 \nHDMI cable       Standard/Cat1        HighSpeed/Cat2        HighSpeed/Cat2\nResolution       2880x576  2560x1600  3840x2160  4096x2160  4096x2160\nMax Refresh Rate 50 Hz     75 Hz      30 Hz      24 Hz      60 Hz\nMax Color Depth  48 bpp    30 bpp     36 bpp     48 bpp     30 bpp\n                                      ^\n\nMind the maximum color depth, although 24 bits per pixel should suffice for most uses. On the Mac, 24 bit is sometimes called \"millions of colors\".\n\nA: The HD 4000 isn't a \"graphics card\" it's a GPU built into the Ivy Bridge processor. You may well find 14Hz is all you can get out of it.\nThe people who succeed in getting 3840 by 2160 at 30HZ are on MacBook Pro's that were released later and have the Intel Iris GPU built in to the Haswell processor.\nGiven even 30hz looks pretty bad you might be best to drop the resolution back to that of a 30\" monitor such as 2560 x 1600 or similar.\n\nA: You're getting that framerate because your Thunderbolt-HDMI adapter supports only 2 PCIe lanes - the specs say 10Gb/s, with a little 'b', and there's 10b/8b error correction.\nThat's just not nearly enough bandwidth for raw 4K.\n@Tony William's answer is fundamentally the better one though, because you'd never be happy with the output even if you soldered the connection to the logic board without a dedicated GPU. I'm not even sure the integrated graphics in Haswell are sufficient.    Probably with Broadwell come 2015.\n\nA: I finally got this to work on my 2012 macbook pro retina (although I hear that non-retina versions work too).  Its a stock MBP with the Intel 4000 chip.  I used SwitchResX and created a custom resolution, set 3840x2160 at 18 Hz using CVT-RB.  Then rebooted, then opened up my display settings and clicked on 3840x2160 and viola, it works.\nNo need for an active displayport to HDMI whatsoever.  I'm using the HDMI that came with the Seiki.\n\nA: I managed to get full 3840×2160 @30Hz on my late 2012 rMBP (intel HD4000) using just a mini-displayport to displayport cable and an app called SwitchResX. The only possible difference is that I used the AOC U2868PQU 4K display which uses MST and I think your display is only SST. Anyway Here are my custom settings, you need to reboot the machine to apply them:\n\nAs a word of warning, this does make things eye-bleedingly small. (Pretty cool though - full-size)\n\nPersonally, I found the ‘scaled’ resolution of 1920×1200 to be the best for me because it uses HiDPI to give you that retina feel you’re used to. It will look like 1920×1200 but actually use more pixels to paint it. Here are the settings:\n\nThis is much more sensible (although I would like it smaller to be honest).\nThe downside is that you lose some of the screen down the sides.

Any suggestions, please?\n\nA: Under Mavericks, if you want to change the password, you need to convert the volume. \nYour problem with the passwords is probably that they might stored in your keychain, therefore it won't ask you for it on your computer. \nYou can remove the stored password in the Keychain Access.app. \n\nA: In Mavericks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility (normally found under Applications -> Utilities)\n\n*Select the appropriate disk image from the left-hand menu\n\n*Go to File -> Change Password\n\n*Create a new password\n\n", "Q: Nervous Cursor on 2013 MacBook Pro 15\" Retina While I try to get some writing done on my MacBook Pro 15\" Retina (first under Mountain Lion and now Mavericks) the cursor will often jump randomly away from where I'm typing to another location in the text. Read somewhere that switching off BlueTooth would help prevent these annoying twitches, but that simply does not seem true: the cursor still jumps unexpectedly especially at higher touch-typing speeds. Is there a known cure for this flaw? It sure plays havoc with productivity. Grrr.\n\nA: Does it jump around randomly everywhere, both desktop and applications, or is it only when you type? Mine jumped around everywhere several times, but every time it stopped after I cleaned the trackpad thoroughly. Also dust can get trapped at the border, so push down and clean as good as you can (beware of using too much water of course).\n\nA: In my experience it is due to accidental input from the touchpad.  Apple does try to limit the problem, but for me it has become a bigger problem with the new bigger touchpad.  The solution I have uses the betterTouchTool app.  I have set up a key - actually on the toucher - which hits the following sequence of key presses: ^z^z^Z where ^ means control.  So it does two undos followed by a redo which puts the cursor back where you were before it jumped elsewhere (usually in the document.

Apple's official documentation on Photo Stream states:\n\nMy Photo Stream stores the last 30 days of photos taken with your iOS\n  device or imported from a camera to your Mac or Windows computer, and\n  automatically pushes them over any available Wi-Fi or Ethernet\n  connection to each of the devices that you set up to work with iCloud.\nFor example, if you take a photo on your iPhone (or save one to your\n  Camera Roll), iCloud automatically stores the photo and pushes it to\n  Photo Stream on your iPad, iPod touch, and other Mac or Windows\n  computers.\n\nWhat's not clear to me is this: does iPhoto actually have to be open in order for Photo Stream photos to be pulled down to my Mac? \nThe reason why I ask is because whenever I open iPhoto, there's a noticeable delay before I see any new Photo Stream photos appear, which suggests that those photos are being downloaded right then.\nIf this is indeed the case, given that Photo Stream only stores the last 30 days' worth of photos, does that mean that I'll start losing photos if I go longer than 30 days without opening iPhoto?\n\nA: iPhoto doesn't have to be open. There's a background process running called iCloud Photos in Mavericks that runs as a system daemon that's taking care of bringing down your Photostream photos.\nThe photos are downloaded to ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub on your Mac. You can press Cmd-Shift-G in Finder and enter that path to browse the location. You'll see a lot of funny named sub-directories and in them: your Photostream photos. I don't recommend messing with this structure though.\nWhat doesn't happen without iPhoto running is your photos getting imported in to iPhoto and organized in to events. So when you open iPhoto it's discovering new Photostream photos that have downloaded since the last time it ran and then importing those photos to bring them in to your iPhoto library. This is where the delay is coming from.\nIf you just want to view your Photostream without having to endure iPhoto you can try MyPhotostream which gives you a simple, read-only way to see your Photostream photos without having to launch iPhoto. It doesn't make iPhoto any faster on start, but if you need to get at your Photostream photos often it can make the process a little less cumbersome.\n", "Q: How can I take a screenshot while holding down the control key? I'd like to screenshot a drag operation on OSX (I'm using Mavericks). Specifically, I need to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the control key\n\n*Begin the drag\n\n*Take a screenshot\n\n*release the mouse button and control keys\n\n\nThe problem is, the various screen capture key combos (Command ⌘+Shift ⇧+3, etc) don't seem to trigger while the control key is held down. Is there any way around this?\n\nA: Can you give more context of how you want to use it? I was able to get a screen grab of a pop-up menu by control-clicking, then doing (Command ⌘+Control+Shift ⇧+3 (instead of releasing the mouse and dragging the selection). This saved a full screen capture to the clipboard, which I could then crop, etc.\nYou could redefine the keyboard shortcuts so that adding Control to the normal shortcut saves to a file, rather than making it save to the clipboard.\nThere is also the Grab program in Utilities, which lets you do timed screenshots, etc, and third party programs which offer even more options. \n\nA: Pretty simple.\nGo to System Preferences, Keyboard, Keyboard Shortcuts, Screen Shots.\nFrom there you can double click the shortcut and change it to any shortcut with \"ctrl\" included.\nVoilá.\nHope it works for you. \n\nA: Open Terminal and type the command below. From there you have 10 seconds before the screenshot is taken (you can do whatever you want or hold any keys you want in that time).\nAfterwards, you can find the screenshot in the directory you executed the command.\nscreencapture -T 10 screenshot.jpg\n\n\nA: I have a slightly different suggestion. It could be worth looking at recording a video of the action and then creating a .gif animated image that shows the full action. This neatly sidesteps the problem and would most likely communicate the action better than a still image anyway.\nThe app that is most widely recommended for screen recording is ScreenFlow which is USD $99.99 on the Mac App Store. It is relatively expensive but I'm not sure what cheaper or free alternatives might be out there.\nThe app that is most widely recommended for creating a GIF from the resulting video is GIF Brewery which is USD $4.99 on the Mac App Store. Again, there are probably cheaper/free ways to do this.\nThere is an article I read a while ago that your question reminded me of. This is where I got the idea from.\n", "Q: How can I cut down on the size of iMovie Library.imovielibrary? I recently noticed that the file at ~/Movies/iMovie Library.imovielibrary is taking up an awful lot of space:\n\nIs there a way to make it smaller? I don't have anything important in iMovie - what happens if I simply delete it?\n\nA: \nIs there a way to make it smaller?\n\nSure — in iMovie, delete what you don't need and the size of the library will reduce.\nIf you're looking for more detail regarding what is taking up space in your library, you can browse the library with something such as DaisyDisk1 which will show what is using the most space.\n\nI don't have anything important in iMovie - what happens if I simply delete it?\n\nYou'll lose all your media from your iMovie library, including footage, projects and associated files such as render files (although if you don't have the media any more the render files are pretty useless).\nYour iMovie settings aren't stored in the library, unless the settings are specific to the library or something in the library, such as project settings.\n1 DaisyDisk needs a bit of prodding to look in packages — right-click the package and choose Show Package Contents.\n", "Q: Can Java 5 be installed on any other OS other than OS X 10.5?

I'm asking this mostly out of curiosity, as I've given up on finding a practical solution. Everyone knows that Chrome makes Macs sluggish, especially if you have a lot of tabs open. My question is what causes this, since it doesn't seem to be due to memory or CPU use.\nI have a habit of keeping around 100 or more tabs open in Google Chrome, in several windows. If this number gets too high then my Mac starts to become unpredictably unresponsive - I'll sometimes have to wait a few seconds after clicking or typing for the input to be accepted, for example, or if I'm playing a game the frame rate might drop to 2-3 frames per second for a minute or two before recovering. This happens particularly if I have Keynote or Pages open in addition to Chrome. Using the Chrome plugin called \"The Great Suspender\" helps quite a bit, especially with keeping CPU use down, but it doesn't completely solve the unresponsiveness issue.\nI used to think that this was a memory issue, but after buying a new Macbook with a lot more memory a year or two ago, this seems not to be the case. Activity Monitor tells me I currently have 4.6Gb free, and this issue can occur when less than half my 16Gb RAM is in use. It doesn't seem to be due to CPU use either (unless it's caused by sudden spikes), since I can keep that down to around 2% most of the time.\nSo if it's not memory or CPU that Chrome and other applications use up to make my computer behave this way, then what is it? And (since it can't hurt to ask) is there anything I can do to mitigate it? \nFinally, I'm using Mountain Lion. Is this issue the same, better, or worse in Mavericks? Whether I will upgrade or not will be determined solely by this issue.\n\nA: This is the common problem which can be related to anything, like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chrome bugs,\n\n*network issues (check logs at chrome://net-internals/),\n\n*active extensions are slowing down web browser in general,\n\n*performance issues (either your machine is slow or you've too many tabs opened),\n\n*slow disk access, especially when your cache folder is huge with too many files.\nE.g. you may consider moving your profile folder into quick access drive.\nHere are few suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*restart web browser (also kill all chrome processes),\n\n*run in Incognito mode, to see if this could be related to some slow extensions,\n\n*create a new profile with no extensions and see if that helps,\n\n*install addons which aims limit the page processing (e.g. OneTab, ad blockers),\n\n*run Chrome in different user data dir (--user-data-dir=\"<some_path>\"),\n\n*run with --disable-hang-monitor to suppress hang monitor dialog,\n\nSuppresses hang monitor dialogs in renderer processes. This may allow slow unload handlers on a page to prevent the tab from closing, but the Task Manager can be used to terminate the offending process in this case.peter.sh\n\n\n*make sure Chrome uses GPU process to enhance performance (see: chrome://gpu/),\n\n*generate network log file at chrome://net-internals/ and report the issue at bugs.chromium.org.\n\n\nDebug suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*check: chrome://flags/\n\n*check debug network log file generated by chrome://net-internals/\n\n*run chrome://tracing/\n\n*see other internal Chrome pages at chrome://chrome-urls/.\n\n", "Q: Which formats does Apple Newsstand accept? Correct me if I'm wrong, but Newsstand content can be published in PDF format.  Via a Newsstand iOS app of course.\nWhat other formats does a Newsstand app work with?  Is epub ok?\nDoes Apple provide any information on content formats (I haven't found any)?\n\nA: The Newsstand is just a special \"Store\" where you can download a 'magazine' app and the Newsstand itself which tracks the \"issues\" that your magazines have available\nSo your Newsstand app can display anything it wants in any format it can decode and display - an issue is just a big bundle of data and the magazine app is just an app that decodes and displays that data.\nApple don't give you any information about content formats as they don't care and don't specify.\nPDF is a popular format as you can easily display PDFs on iOS using WebKit, indeed most magazines seem to use Webkit for displaying their data since it allows you to show a bunch of formats and it works well with embedded links.\n", "Q: Can I browse the Safari history of my Ipad on my mac? My mac and my iPod share a common iCloud account. Is it possible to browse on my mac the history of Safari on my iPad?\n\nA: No, this is currently not possible.

If one could bring iTunes to run on such a low cost single board computer, it could be utilized as a music/video server which could be controlled via Apple's Remote App on iOs devices (e.g. I could stream music to AirPlay speakers or videos to Apple TV). I would also be able to stream music/videos it to my iOS device or Mac when Home Sharing is activated.\nSo, is this possible? Is there such a computer that is fast enough to do video streaming, running iTunes, attach HDD? Or are they all too slow? Any other obstacles?\n\nA: The primary obstacle to getting a full featured program like iTunes to work is running OS X on non Apple hardware and/or Windows on ARM. \nI do run ubuntu on a Beagle Black and it is suitable for music streaming and light video streaming using open source packages. Nothing I have found works as well as an AppleTV and iTunes Match for music streaming, though. The black CPU is dual core, but severely resource constrained so it can generally walk or chew gum but not both. \n\nA: I have built just such a device using a Raspberry Pi and separate DAC from Hifiberry.com (the built-in Pi soundcard is notoriously bad).\nIn terms of software, I'm running the Raspbian distro, along with forked-daapd which is an iTunes-compatible music server - I rsynced the ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music folder from my Mac over to the forked-daapd folder on the Pi. I control this using the Apple Remote app from my iPhone - it even picks up the artwork. Nice setup and the DAC sounds great.\nI'm also running Shairport so it can act as an Airplay receiver, too.\n(As a side note, I'm trying to go one step further and have this work without any separate network infrastructure as I want to use it in my car - I've added a USB wireless adapter to the Pi and configured it to act as a wireless access point, then connected the iPhone to it directly via wifi. It's almost working perfectly, aside from this rather nuanced but important issue.)\n\nA: I used XBMC on a raspberry pi using OPENELEC. You won't have a full blown iTunes but you can have a very good media center with Airplay capabilities and plenty of really cool XBMC add-ons. I totally recommend it. \n", "Q: Censor bleep keyboard shortcut I want the censor beep that you hear on TV to play continuously as a system sound when I hold down F12 on my MacBook.\nI make screen recordings for YouTube videos. Because I have brothers and sisters that use profanity and I want to keep those moments out of my videos without further editing after I record them. \nIs there a way to do this (assuming I am able to press the key fast enough of course)?\n\nA: Pretty much no matter how loud you play it, the profanity will be audible to some extent. Plus, it's hard to predict when it's coming (which is why networks need to use 10-second delays when broadcasting live stuff). It's best to edit this in iMovie by detatching the audio and using the Split command before the offending word, then trimming the audio clip until the swear is out of your video. Then, drag your censor sound effect to the end of the first of your separated audio clips and trim that bleep to the start of the rest of your audio.\nWith this in mind, if the exact thing you requested in your question is what you want, you'll need to make a Service in Automator. First, open Automator, then create a Service in the next dialog. Find the Run Shell Script command and drag it into the drag-and-drop area. Copy-paste the text below into the text input area, replacing completePathOfFile with the path of your file:\nAfplay completePathOfFile\nSave this file and pick a memorable name.\nNow go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > Scroll to General. After finding the service you saved earlier, click the Add Shortcut button and type the F12 key. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: iTunes always asks me whether to back up apps from my iPad and iPhone Every time I connect my iPad or iPhone to my Mac, iTunes gives me a prompt like this:\n\nI’ve been clicking “Back Up Apps” for both devices, and yet I get the same prompt every time I connect. How can I stop iTunes from asking me every time? (I don’t really care whether it backs up my apps or not.)\n\nA: Please check out this page by Apple\nYou can change this in the iTunes settings, called Automatic Downloads.\nCheck the box, as the image displays and the applications should download instead of ask for a backup.\nIf you cannot click the checkboxes, you have sign in to the iTunes Store with your Apple ID.\n\n", "Q: I'm looking for an iphone alarm app with both programmable days and gradual alarm sound \n*\n\n*It has to have days of the week to repeat alarms, i forget to set them otherwise. the default clock app has it.\n\n*Alarms should get gradually louder, i'm sick of scrambling to silence the phone as soon as it starts screaming at me.

Trello's URL whitelist consists only of *trello.com* and Chat's is similarly limited:\n\n\nClicking links to any other URL opens the page in Chrome, my default browser. This works perfectly in all cases except with Google documents.

Has anyone else ever experienced it? What's the fix? \n\nA: Developer of Fluid Here. Basically, this is a bug. \nIt stems from the fact that Google is the search provider supported in the toolbar search field. Therefore google.com URLs are currently always white-listed.\nI would like to fix this eventually.\n", "Q: Terminal wraps at 80 chars even if window is wider Problem description\nIf I increase the width of a Terminal version 2.3 (309) window, and then use less (or some command invoking less, like man) in that window, I often get garbled output, since the lines wrap at 80 characters even though the window is wider and less tries to format the text for that wider window. \n\n\n*\n\n*This is the same for native OS X 10.8.5 less and the less 458 MacPorts installs. It is even the same if less is invoked remotely on some other host from an interactive ssh session.\n\n*resize does print the correct size, and eval `resize` does not help. Which is not surprising, since less does seem to have the right idea as to how wide the window is, it's just confused by the fact that lines break too early.\n\n*Normal command line output (outside less) will span the whole window.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThis appears to be a bug in how cup (cursor positioning mode) is handled by the application. The following code can be used to reproduce the problem:\ntput smcup; echo {0..200}; sleep 2; tput rmcup\n\nThe whole issue appears to be related to the fact that I have configured Terminal to set the emulation mode and TERM environment variable to xterm-color instead of the default xterm-256color. I did so since the latter is not available on several hosts that I ssh to, causing applications on those hosts to complain about missing functionality.\nWorkarounds\nOne way to avoid this issue seems to be executing the command\ntput -T xterm-256color smcup; tput -T xterm-256color rmcup\n\nafter every change of terminal size. But that's quite annoying. Another workaround would be changing the terminal emulation back to xterm-256color and copying the terminfo data to those remote hosts which do not support that value out of the box. Which can be annoying, too, if you only want to have a quick look at some remote host.\nCore question\nOn the whole it seems to me as if emulation of the xterm-color setting is not supported as well as one would hope. Is this a bug in Terminal.app, or did I misunderstand something about how this whole mess is supposed to work?\nDoes someone have a more appropriate solution how to handle these incompatibilities?\nTechnical details\nFor further information, here is the output of infocmp xterm-color xterm-256color, slightly trunkated by removing some key definitions:\ncomparing xterm-color to xterm-256color.\n    comparing booleans.\n    bce: F:T.\n    ccc: F:T.\n    mc5i: F:T.\n    npc: F:T.\n    comparing numbers.\n    colors: 8, 256.\n    ncv: NULL, NULL.\n    pairs: 64, 32767.\n    comparing strings.\n    blink: NULL, '\\E[5m'.\n    cbt: NULL, '\\E[Z'.\n    civis: NULL, '\\E[?25l'.\n    cnorm: NULL, '\\E[?12l\\E[?25h'.\n    cvvis: NULL, '\\E[?12;25h'.\n    ech: NULL, '\\E[%p1%dX'.\n    el1: NULL, '\\E[1K'.\n    enacs: '\\E)0', NULL.\n    flash: NULL, '\\E[?5h$<100/>\\E[?5l'.\n    hpa: NULL, '\\E[%i%p1%dG'.\n    ich: NULL, '\\E[%p1%d@'.\n    indn: NULL, '\\E[%p1%dS'.\n    initc: NULL, '\\E]4;%p1%d;rgb\\:%p2%{255}%*%{1000}%/%2.2X/%p3%{255}%*%{1000}%/%2.2X/%p4%{255}%*%{1000}%/%2.2X\\E\\\\'.\n    invis: NULL, '\\E[8m'.\n    is2: '\\E[m\\E[?7h\\E[4l\\E>\\E7\\E[r\\E[?1;3;4;6l\\E8', '\\E[!p\\E[?3;4l\\E[4l\\E>'.\n    kDC: NULL, '\\E[3;2~'.\n    kEND: NULL, '\\E[1;2F'.\n    kHOM: NULL, '\\E[1;2H'.\n[ ⋮ ]\n    kri: NULL, '\\E[1;2A'.\n    kslt: '\\E[4~', NULL.\n    mc0: NULL, '\\E[i'.\n    mc4: NULL, '\\E[4i'.\n    mc5: NULL, '\\E[5i'.\n    op: '\\E[m', '\\E[39;49m'.\n    rin: NULL, '\\E[%p1%dT'.\n    rmacs: '^O', '\\E(B'.\n    rmam: NULL, '\\E[?7l'.\n    rmcup: '\\E[2J\\E[?47l\\E8', '\\E[?1049l'.\n    rmm: NULL, '\\E[?1034l'.\n    rmso: '\\E[m', '\\E[27m'.\n    rmul: '\\E[m', '\\E[24m'.\n    rs1: NULL, '\\Ec'.\n    rs2: '\\E[m\\E[?7h\\E[4l\\E>\\E7\\E[r\\E[?1;3;4;6l\\E8', '\\E[!p\\E[?3;4l\\E[4l\\E>'.\n    setab: '\\E[4%p1%dm', '\\E[%?%p1%{8}%<%t4%p1%d%e%p1%{16}%<%t10%p1%{8}%-%d%e48;5;%p1%d%;m'.\n    setaf: '\\E[3%p1%dm', '\\E[%?%p1%{8}%<%t3%p1%d%e%p1%{16}%<%t9%p1%{8}%-%d%e38;5;%p1%d%;m'.\n    sgr: NULL, '%?%p9%t\\E(0%e\\E(B%;\\E[0%?%p6%t;1%;%?%p2%t;4%;%?%p1%p3%|%t;7%;%?%p4%t;5%;%?%p7%t;8%;m'.\n    sgr0: '\\E[m', '\\E(B\\E[m'.\n    smacs: '^N', '\\E(0'.\n    smam: NULL, '\\E[?7h'.\n    smcup: '\\E7\\E[?47h', '\\E[?1049h'.\n    smm: NULL, '\\E[?1034h'.\n    vpa: NULL, '\\E[%i%p1%dd'.\n\n\nA: xterm-color represents an older branch from Xterm that does not accurately reflect a number of important features supported by Terminal (and Xterm).\nIn older versions of Terminal, the default value of the TERM environment variable was xterm-color because it was more compatible with Terminal, but that has not been the case for several OS X releases. The current default is xterm-256color.\nIf you're connecting to a remote host that doesn't include xterm-256color, first try xterm-16color and then xterm and see if those are available. They are essentially the same except that they declare different numbers of supported colors. They represent the current Xterm, and are much more compatible with Terminal than xterm-color.\nSee my answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/79016/6883 for more details.\n", "Q: How do I stop my iPad from wrongly auto correcting my name?

I have multiple Macs (for multiple users) backing up to a single Time Capsule over our network with an external USB drive connected. In the case of the backups saved to the external drive, they're all saved in the drive's root directory.\nMy Time Capsule is protected with user accounts, and each user has their own account.\nI'd like to configure Time Machine such that each user can only see their own backup file on the Time Capsule, not those of other users, when they open the Time Capsule in Finder.\nI'm aware that there's an option to encrypt backups in Time Machine setup, but the language around it suggests that the entire disk will be encrypted with a single password; I don't want to do this. I simply want each user to only be able to see their own backup file when they open the Time Capsule in Finder, and I want them to be able to log into the Time Capsule with their own username and password.\nIs this the actual functionality of encrypting backups? If not, is there another way I can accomplish this?\n\nA: Apple tried encrypting each user's files in FileVault 1 and did away with that when FileVault 2 arrived. \nThe easy/recommended way to do this is make no user an admin so that they cannot get around the prohibition to look at other user files. Also, you will have to physically secure the backup drive or trust that no one breaks the policy to not access that drive. \nOne easy thing you could do is have each Mac encrypt the backups by ticking that switch to prevent some users from seeing files from another computer but that won't prevent same computer users that are admin and know what to type.  The downside there is for several computers managing the passwords becomes onerous to a less than ideal step up in privacy. \nI would recommend you set up storage on a Mac mini server and have it serve up Time machine to each Mac so that you can control access better than using TimeCapsule. The performance will go up substantially along with the cost. The setup is fairly easy and there are inexpensive books to guide you if needed. AppleCare also supports server so hat is extremely inexpensive for three years of phone support for enterprise caliber support. \n", "Q: Where is the MacBook Air (13\") Mid 2012 fan exhaust?

I have /opt/local/bin/php because I'm using MacPorts.\n\nA: In my case it was /usr/local/php5/bin/php whereas 'php5' is an alias that points to the liip installation dir /usr/local/php5-5.3.29-20141019-211753.\nAnd by the way it solved my textmate line output on syntax checking on osx 10.12. Thanks a lot. \n", "Q: How can I rotate my images directly from the finder? I would like to rotate my images directly from the Finder. \nThe best would be one of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*a button to click in the menu bar of every Finder's window\n\n*a button to click in Quicklook\n\n\nBut, if it can be done with a keyboard-shorcut, it would be fine also.\nIs one of these features possible? And if yes, how can I do?\n\nA: Yes - you can use Automator to make a service for Finder (or all applications) to perform rotation of images. Then you can assign a keyboard shortcut to that action.\n\nI'm not aware of quicklook plug-in that rotate, but that's something that might exist. Modifying finder's shortcut bar might be the least likely way to activate things, but hopefully an Automator service (or app / droplet) will do.\n\nA: In Mojave press ⌘+A, then right click > Quick Actions > Rotate Left.\nThis has the side effect of updating the icon on the Finder.\n", "Q: Can't find backup files on Macintosh HD? When opening the OS X System information it says I have 67 GB backups: \n\nBut when I'm using Disk Inventory X to find large files on my Mac i can't find any backups files:\n\nI don't know anything about any backups files stored locally. I have a backup to a Time Capsule.\nDisk Inventory X says I only using 69 GB, but the System information says I have 140 GB.\nCan I delete the backup files and how?\n\nA: The backups are stored in a hidden volume called .MobileBackups. These are Time Machine's local snapshots. They are separate backups that save previous versions of files for cases where your Time Machine drive is not available. You shouldn't modify the contents of this volume directly, and therefore it is usually not visible in most cases.\nYou can disable local snapshots by running sudo tmutil disablelocal.\nRe-enable with sudo tmutil enablelocal.\n", "Q: How to Disable USB Auto-mount I use VirtualBox on my MBP and often need to mount my USB flash drive inside the guest.  The problem I'm running into is that the host OS (OS X Mavericks) immediately mounts the USB flash drive when I insert it.  When I try to unmount it (gracefully, through Finder), OS X complains that the device is in use.  Further research into lsof reveals that Spotlight and AVG are doing their thing with the flash drive.\nRather than fiddling with individual app settings, I'd like to just modify the host OS behavior so that the USB device doesn't auto-mount.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: OS X has a mechanism, called the Disk Arbitration framework, through which programs can control what happens when disks are inserted or ejected.  It also provides an opportunity to intercept a disk insertion event and prevent the usual automatic mounting behaviour.\nTo change the behaviour, though, requires a third-party utility, since the Disk Arbitration framework is just a programming interface.  One good utility is Disk Arbitrator, a free (BSD-licensed) tool by Aaron Burghardt.\n\nWhile Disk Arbitrator is running, you can choose to either veto the mounting of newly inserted disks, mount them read-only, or just let the normal automatic mounting happen.  After Disk Arbitrator exits, the normal mounting behaviour is restored.\n\nA: I think that modifying fstab to turn off automount is a bit excessive for what you are trying to do.  It's sort of like removing the doors on your car because every now and then you need to get in or out.\nFor this, I would use VirtualBox's built in USB Filters.  This allows you to automatically mount a particular USB device upon insertion.  You can find the USB filters under the \"Settings\" menu of the particualr VM you wish to assign it to.\nFor instance, my USB devices are are listed below that are available if I want to automatically attach it to my Windows 10 Pro VM.  I can attach my Seagate FreeAgent Go, or my SanDisk Cruzer or any of the attached USB devices.  However, attaching the Logitech USB receiver would ultimately make the mouse inoperable on the host, so be careful what you attach.\n, \nHow do I know this works?  Well, I accidentally attached a FreeAgent Go drive and it wouldn't (as I perceived) mount in OS X.  See my original \n\"problem\":  USB Drive Will Not Mount, Not Listed in Disk Utilities, but Found In System Profiler\nIt does it by serial number or by UUID (I haven't investigated enough to figure out which) but I had several FreeAgent Go drives of the exact same model and size and only one was auto attaching to the VM. At the time, I thought my drive had gone bad.\nThe bottom line is that automount still worked, and I was able to attach a USB device directly to a VM without having to go through the trouble of unmounting it first\n\nA: This is how I disable auto mounting of APFS volumes on macOS Catalina.\nFor macOS volumes, both Macintosh HD - Data and Macintosh HD type volumes need to be referenced in /etc/fstab.\nFind volume(s) using diskutil list and set VOLUME_PATH accordingly.\n# Disable auto mounting of \"macOS - Data\" volume\nVOLUME_PATH=\"/Volumes/macOS - Data\"\nVOLUME_UUID=`diskutil info \"$VOLUME_PATH\" | awk '/Volume UUID:/ { print $3 }'`\ncat << EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\nUUID=$VOLUME_UUID none apfs rw,noauto\nEOF\n\n# Disable auto mounting of \"macOS\" volume\nVOLUME_PATH=\"/Volumes/macOS\"\nVOLUME_UUID=`diskutil info \"$VOLUME_PATH\" | awk '/Volume UUID:/ { print $3 }'`\ncat << EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\nUUID=$VOLUME_UUID none apfs rw,noauto\nEOF\n\nHere is what is going when running above commands:\nSet VOLUME_PATH variable to /Volumes/macOS - Data\nVOLUME_PATH=\"/Volumes/macOS - Data\"\n\nSet VOLUME_UUID variable to volume UUID of /Volumes/macOS - Data volume\nRunning diskutil info \"$VOLUME_PATH\" outputs volume details of /Volumes/macOS - Data (which includes its UUID).\nPiping (|) these details to awk '/Volume UUID:/ { print $3 }' extracts the UUID.\nVOLUME_UUID=`diskutil info \"$VOLUME_PATH\" | awk '/Volume UUID:/ { print $3 }'`\n\nAppend UUID=$VOLUME_UUID none apfs rw,noauto to /etc/fstab and output to console (see tee)\ncat << EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\nUUID=$VOLUME_UUID none apfs rw,noauto\nEOF\n\n\nA: According to Topher Kessler article on CNET, you can add an entry to /etc/fstab, specifying the noauto option.\nSuch an entry might look like this:\nUUID=791E37B4-82A3-37E7-9F15-3C39359126B4   none  hfs  rw,noauto\n\nThe UUID may be obtained by looking for the Volume UUID line that is printed when you run diskutil info /Volumes/volume name.\n\nA: I found a official guide at https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-7942 \"Prevent a volume from mounting at startup\"\n", "Q: Is my iPad 2 a \"Rev A\"?

I'm trying to use the Seiki 4k display model SE39UY04 with a Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013 MacBook Pro at 3840x2160 @ 30 Hz running Mavericks.  I've gotten it to work twice now on two different days, but upon returning my MacBook to the display and trying to reconnect, I'm now failing again on the third try.  Each time I've had to fiddle with it for around 45 minutes until I somehow got it to work.  At first it appeared that using SetResX was incompatible, so I uninstalled that and it seemed to help.  While away from the monitor, I added QuickRes as an alternative to SetResX, but now, even after rebooting multiple times and no longer running QuickRes, I'm unable to get the external display to work today.  The symptom is that the Seiki gives the message Not Support so it seems it sees a signal that it does not support.  I'm using the HDMI cable included with the monitor.\nAre there any tools that I can use to help debug why this works intermittently?  Is there some kind of driver that needs to be updated?  Does this symptom suggest the HDMI cable is flaky?  Is there a good order to attach the screen relative to the built in display being on (laptop lid up)?\nHere is output to /var/log/system.log after plugging in the HDMI cable:\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Received display connect changed for display 0x4280380\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Found 62 modes for display 0x04280380 [36, 26]\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003d\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f003d [1, 0]\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003e\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f003e [1, 0]\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003f\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f003f [1, 0]\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: CGXMuxAcknowledge: Posting glitchless acknowledge\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x2ac00003\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: uuid_callback_master: failed to retrieve UUID for display 0x2ac00003 (1001) (invariant failure)\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x2ac00003\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: uuid_callback_master: failed to retrieve UUID for display 0x2ac00003 (1001) (invariant failure)\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x2ac00003\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: uuid_callback_master: failed to retrieve UUID for display 0x2ac00003 (1001) (invariant failure)\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x2ac00003\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: uuid_callback_master: failed to retrieve UUID for display 0x2ac00003 (1001) (invariant failure)\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x2ac00003\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: uuid_callback_master: failed to retrieve UUID for display 0x2ac00003 (1001) (invariant failure)\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: CGSCopyDisplayUUID: Invalid display 0x2ac00003\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro Dock[288]: uuid_callback_master: failed to retrieve UUID for display 0x2ac00003 (1001) (invariant failure)\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: MPAccessSurfaceForDisplayDevice: Set up page flip mode on display 0x04280380 device: 0x7feef1a035b0  isBackBuffered: 0 numComp: 1 numDisp: 3\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Received display connect changed for display 0x4280380\nFeb 12 10:13:37 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Found 1 modes for display 0x04280380 [1, 0]\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Received display connect changed for display 0x4280380\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Found 62 modes for display 0x04280380 [36, 26]\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003d\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f003d [1, 0]\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003e\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f003e [1, 0]\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003f\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Found 130 modes for display 0x003f003f [60, 36]\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Display 0x003f003f changed state to online\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: MPServiceForDisplayDevice: Invalid device alias (0)\nFeb 12 10:13:38 ws-macbook-pro WindowServer[95]: Display 0x2ac00003: GL mask 0x8;

If I use guest account it is normal about 8 - 9 hours... After shut down, when I first log in to guest acc (not to my acc) it is really great (8 hours). But if I first log in to my acc and after i logout and log in to guest it is still only 4 hours. It is like some of these programs eat my battery. But in activity monitor is all right... What do you think? Where can be problem?\nThanks for replies\nI have OS X Mavericks (10.9.1)\n\nA: MAMP. quit out of MAMP and you will see vast improvement.\n", "Q: Non app store apps for iPhone 3G I recently bought iPhone 3G from a friend, but i can't download apps from the official appstore because my iOS version is 4.2. Is there any website or even a way to install apps like facebook, without custom firmware like whited00r?\n\nA: No, this is not possible. If an app requires a certain version of iOS, then you must meet that requirement, otherwise the app will not be able to be installed. You may be able to get hold of a version of the app that used to work on iOS 4.2, but it depends on the app.\n", "Q: Streaming video without an internet connection I have a customer that wants to stream his Iphone 5 and iPad video and audio files over his wireless network.  this network is not connected to the internet 80% of the time making using an Apple TV nearly impossible.  Is there any other hardware, such as a WiFi Blu-ray player that would be capable of doing this procedure for him?  \nThe reason this network is not connected to the internet most of the time is that it is in his private jet that only gets internet above 10k feet and only within the continental US\n\nA: You dont need the internet connection to stream, you just need a wifi network (a router; example: stream from the iphone to the apple tv via an airport express creating a network). If you neglect DRM-protected stuff that is, which needs access to the internet.\nApparently you just have to activate the apple tv beforehand though, which requires an internet connection.\nAnother option would be a Chromecast.\n", "Q: Is there an iPad/iPhone app that can handle editing large (~10000 line) text files? I'm looking for an iPad/iPhone app that can handle editing large (~10000 line) text files. I would like this app to be able to access a particular Dropbox file quickly, and after editing have the file be updated on Dropbox.\nFinally, I would be happy if it only allows me to edit the first few lines, or to add to the top of a particular file. (I currently have a cronjob which does this -- I edit a particular blank text file, and the cronjob adds it to the top of the larger file, but would like a more direct solution.)\n\nA: If adding to the front of a file is OK then I use Drafts for this.\nIt allows you to type some text and have it added to the front (\"prepended\") of a file in Dropbox. It can even automatically add the date.\nI'm not sure if it has a limit to the length of the file, mine are only a hundred or so lines.\nDrafts allows you to type some test and quickly perform any number of actions with it. One of my highly recommended iOS applications.\n", "Q: Is there any way to remotly access ios device from another ios device? I have Ipod touch which is connected to TV. Is there any app that allow this Ipod be controlled remotely using another IOS device like Ipad? (for sure without jail breaking)\nOr more specifically, Is there any apps available that convert ipod touch into virtual apple tv?\n\nA: No, this is not possible due to restrictions in place on iOS (namely sandboxing and multitasking).\n\nA: Without a jailbreak? Absolutely not. With a jailbreak? Sure, install veency from Saurik's repository, Telesphoreo Tangelo, in Cydia on the host device, and then install a VNC app from the App Store on the client device.\n", "Q: Save it or replace it? I have an mid 2009 MacBook Pro 13\" (processor: 2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, memory: 2 GB 1067 MHz DDR3, HDD: 160 GB SATA) and it has started giving me trouble a few months ago. It runs on Max OS 10.7.5 and has been getting excruciatingly slow. Additional software is Adobe CS4, Skype and OpenOffice.  I mostly use it for OpenOffice work, internet research, Skype, and movies.\nThe cost to fix it with a new battery, new RAM and new HDD which would get me in the price range of about $300 to 400 in my estimates.\nWhat reasons should could help decide between fixing it or rather save up for a replacement. MacBook Pro 13\" again with a non-retina display?\n\nA: My mom is still using my 2009 MBP without any issue.  If the CPU is fast enough for you, I'd recommend refurbing it.  \nI'd also agree with Robuust about getting an SSD.  The prices are low enough now that you should be able to get 250GB for < $250 and anything smaller is still < $1/GB.  If you've been getting by with a 160GB spinning drive, you'll be amazed by the speed increase.  Mine went from a 40s boot time to about 12s.\nThe only caveat I see is that my mom's MB DID need a new keyboard a couple years ago due to the mouse button failing to click anymore.  That was a $80 repair -- bought one from ebay and installed it myself.  So if you have any kind of HW problems, you would need to address those down the road.\nThen again, you can get a complete late-model MBP on ebay for $700-ish.  If you aren't afraid of buying a used one, that may be the better way, but for what you are doing, the old one should continue to work well.\n\nA: I would reinstall the system first. Backup everything to a USB disk using time machine. Format and reinstall OS X. When it asks you to migrate data at the end of installation, do it.\nThis will remove a lot of junk that your system accumulated over years (yes, it does accumulate a lot of it!)\n\nA: How much space is left on the harddisc? If not much, this alone may slow it down.\nI'd get a cheap usb/network harddisk, and back up the stuff you need (I prefer not to use Time Machine). Then, get Mavericks and make a clean install, using the macbook as it is. Among other things Mavericks uses some needed memory compression. After, try to keep 10-20GB free always - put stuff on external HD if needed.\nThe Macbook should be plenty for your needs, if you don't use Adobe CS4 a lot. And if you can live with the battery life.\n", "Q: Battery problem for Iphone 4 I having the same problem with my iPhone running the diagnostics described here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Battery diagnostic tool at Apple Genius Bars\nI tried the steps shown above, i opened up apple store and opened the safari. input the dianostics.apple.com or diagnosis.apple.com but the browser is saying \"safari cannot open the page because the server cannot be found.\ncan you help me? \n\nA: FYI I am not aware that Apple has anything at diagnostics.apple.com or diagnosis.apple.com. \nFor troubleshooting help with iPhones you can go to \nhttp://www.apple.com/support/iphone/ \n...or fill us in on exactly what your problem is, step by step.

At some point later, I want to go back and read what problems the installation found. \nDoes brew automatically keep track of these installation logs?  If not, is there any way I could instruct it (perhaps with a parameter) to always record the installation log on a file?\n\nA: Logs are stored in ~/Library/Logs/Homebrew.\nYou can browse this in Finder or using Console.app.\n\nIf you want to save your own log of an install, you can use…\n\nbrew install <formula> 2>&1 | tee install.log\n\n\nSource: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/10430\n", "Q: How do I disable the Google Translation bar when using iPhone? Some websites offer the Google Translation Bar hard-coded into their pages so when I visit those this bar appears on top. Like in this example:\n\nThe problem with this bar however is, is that it's not scrollable. So when viewing the page on an iPhone, I can't get to the Options button of it at the far right. So I can't select Options to disable Google Translate for this website.\nIn Chrome you can go to Settings to turn Google Translate off for all websites. But in Safari for iPhone you can't do that. And I can't swipe the bar or something like that to get to all options. So how am I supposed to disable that translation bar when I can't get to it?\n\nA: Using IOS, open google homepage. Tap on 3 buttons tab in upper right. Tap Settings, then tap Content Settings. Slide bar left to turn off function.\n\nA: Worked for me: \nUsing your iOS device, open the Settings app. Scroll down and select Safari, scroll down and select Advanced, then select Website Data. \nSearch for \"translate\" or \"google\". For each item you want to remove, swipe left to reveal the \"Delete\" button. \nDelete all items related to Google Translate, and retry a site know to display the translate bar.\n\nA: Worked for me :\nIf you are not able to close the bar, rotate your iphone sideway and then you will be able to see the entire bar (Make sure your rotation is not locked)\n", "Q: How can I export my Comcast address book to my iPad? I have tried many systems to export my comcast address book to the Ipad without success. The sync worked for my files but not the contacts.

I am one frustrated old lady.\n\nA: Follow this guide to export your contacts from Comcast in the vCard format (VCF): http://www.watchingthenet.com/export-address-book-contacts-from-comcast-webmail.html\nThen, email the vCard file to yourself. Open that email on your iPad and download the attachment. Now you will have your Comcast contacts on your iPad.\n", "Q: Custom Finder sidebar icon gets stretched Yesterday, I installed and configured Netatalk 3 on my Raspberry Pi in order to be able to mount it as an AFP share. Today I got fed up with how it looked in Finder's sidebar, so I set out to create an icon for it. I then made this (note the pixel-perfectness of the 16x16 version):\n\nand combined the four resulting files (16x16, 16x16@2x, 32x32, 32x32@2x) using iconutil to get a retina-ready ICNS.\nInside of Finder, the 16x16 version of the icon looks like it got shifted to the side by half a pixel:\n\nWhy is that? I double-checked the resolutions of my source icons and those inside the ICNS file and they're all correctly sized.\n\nA: Turns out that Finder uses 18x18px icons, not 16x16px icons.\nIf you're designing sidebar icons, you'll need to supply these as well, which is impossible because there is literally no tool that'll pack 18x18 images (or their @2x counterparts) into an icns file.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro not booting off OS X Mavericks USB Drive I'm trying to do a clean install of OS X Mavericks 10.9.1 from a USB drive on my new MacBook Pro 15\" Retina (late 2013 model). Here are my steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the Mac\n\n*Hold Option\n\n*Turn on the Mac\n\n*Select the USB drive (orange icon), not the Recovery Partition\n\n*The dreaded \"international no\" sign appears\n\n\n\nI've repeated these steps with another USB drive with the same unfortunate result.\nThe USB drives aren't the problem. I've repeated these steps on my iMac 21.5\" (late 2011 model) and MacBook Air 11\" (late 2013 model) and both USB drives boot up fine.\nAny idea how to get this working with my MacBook Pro?\nP.S. If it matters, here's how I made the USB drive.\nEdit: 10.9.2 works great!\n\nA: You can't use the Mac App Store build of 10.9.1 on Late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro's. That's why there is a separate 10.9.1 update for only those machines. You need to use Internet Recovery (Command-Option-R on boot) to install 10.9.1 and not the App Store version. The build number is 13B3109 for the Late 2013 rMBP while it's 13B43 for the App Store version. You can make a USB flash drive of the correct build but you need need to boot with Internet Recovery, start the install on a partition and when it restarts to finish the install you hold the option key down and boot from another partition with an already installed correct build (13B3109) and in a hidden directory on the partition you chose to install, there is an InstallESD.dmg you can then copy and use to create a USB flash installer for that build.\nNow that 10.9.2 is released, the Mac App Store build will work on the Late 2013 rMBP as well as all the other Macs with the possible exception of the new Mac Pro.\n\nA: A 10.9.2 install now that it is released can boot the 2013 MacBook Pro. \n", "Q: Mac Boot Option not Showing Base System Whenever i hit ⌥ or ALT when I boot up my Mac only the Boot Option \"Mac Hard Drive\" shows. \"Mac OS X Base System\" or \"Recovery 10.9.1\" doesn't show up. Can someone help me on this? Do i need to make a recovery drive or something?\n\nA: I never saw Base system on any of my Macs since 2008. Recovery partition is not created in all cases (for example, if you used PGP WDE or other disk encryption software or you installed your OS from the USB key created by a Disk Utility). You may recreate a recovery partition though. See http://hints.binaryage.com/recover-lost-recovery-hd-for-filevault/ (too long to quote here).\n\nA: Do you have FileVault 2 enabled? If you do, the Recovery HD volume is not listed in the screen shown when you hold option at startup. You can start up from the recovery partition by holding command-R though. See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4811 (OS X Lion: Using FileVault 2 and Lion Recovery).\n", "Q: How to Launch Multiple Applications Together? I was wondering if there was an easy way to launch a specific Application whenever another Application is launched.  In other words, I want to launch multiple Applications together as a group.\nTo be more specific, I have  small app that downloads lyrics for the currently playing iTunes track, and another that writes the currently playing track to a file.  The problem is, I often forget to launch these apps when I start iTunes.  I would like them to open every time I open iTunes.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: Save a plist like this as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/some.label.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>some.label</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>bash</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>if pgrep -x iTunes;then open -jga Some\\ Application;open -jga Another\\ Application;fi</string>\n  </array>\n  <key>WatchPaths</key>\n  <string>~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThen run launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/some.label.plist.\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist seems to be modified every time iTunes is opened. The program will be run every time ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist is modified (and there's at least 10 seconds from the last run), but it's probably better than running the program for example every 5 seconds.\nFor most applications, open -jg opens the application hidden and without making it frontmost. For some applications like TextEdit, it opens a new visible window if the application is open but has no windows, but you can use pgrep -x TextEdit||open -jga TextEdit or lsappinfo launch nofront=true launchandhide=true /Applications/TextEdit.app instead.\n", "Q: Does the iPod Touch 5th Generation have a magnetometer sensor? The title says it all: I wonder, does the 5th iPod Touch generation have a magnetometer?

(The goal of this is to not have google drive use 2x the memory because it is replicating the data on both OSs)\nI've read accounts of this setup being successfully used with Dropbox, but not google drive.\nThe latest saying it doesn't work, but no details stating why.\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/drive/8OHJt7NvdR8/8CJiBdaxs_4J\nHoping someone here has had success with this approach.\n\nA: It can be done.  I have two Macbooks setup like this.  Partition 1 is Mac, 2 is Google Drive, 3 is Windows.  All can be seen, written and read from both OSX and Windows.\nTo do this, run bootcamp assistant and partition the drive so that the Mac OS partition is the size you want the OSX + Google Drive to be.\nDo not install Windows yet.  Reboot into OSX, then go to disk utility, and partition the OSX partition again, this time call the second partition as Google Drive. You will now have 2 OS partitions, and one NTFS.\nNow reboot, and hold down alt to choose to boot from your windows installation media.\nChoose advanced installation, and select the partition that you want to install Windows on to. You may need to choose to format the partition too.\nWindows will install.\nNow reboot into OSX, setup Google Drive and choose advanced.  It will ask you to choose where Drive is located.  Here's the tricky part..... if you choose the new partition, it will say it's not empty.  So you need to show hidden files (there's many tutorials and methods on line to show how to do this).  Now you need to delete these 4 files.  Each time I've done this has been trial and error.  Programs like BlueHarvest may help, but you will need to use Terminal and various delete commands to get them to go and do in the correct order. It took me about 45 minuets last time.  I lost track of the correct order.  When they all do delete, have the Google Drive setup assistant ready to choose the now empty partition. Select the drive and  it will start to sync and you're done.\nI use Paragon and Mac Drive 9 to allow full read / write from both OS.  \nMac and Google partitions are Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and Windows is NTFS.\n", "Q: How many hours since I unplugged my Mac?

I'm using a Seiki 4k display model SE39UY04 connected via HDMI with a Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013 MacBook Pro at 3840x2160 @ 30 Hz running Mavericks.  I've noticed that with the laptop closed and only displaying on the external display, I sometimes find in Chrome that bluetooth attached keyboard response is very sluggish.  For example, I can type a sentence on a web page but nothing appears at first, then a few words, and finally the rest appears quickly, however, the delay between typing and completion of it showing up can be 30 seconds or so.  I've looked at the Activity Monitor and do not see any CPU hog, the machine is relatively idle and the fan is not running on the laptop.\nHow can I figure out the cause of this intermittent delay that seems to have appeared with the introduction of the very large external display?\n\nA: This is a bug in Chrome as recorded at google as issue 319580.\nThe other symptoms as described in that bug report are that display update is very slow when the animated icon for the browser tab is on any 4K display such as the Seiki 39 mentioned in the question.  One work around is to move the browser tab animation off screen and performance returns to normal.  There is a fix forthcoming to Chrome that is available now in the Canary builds.\n", "Q: Make iPhone apps think no external monitor connected How can I make iPhone apps think that no external display is connected?\nI am using a 30-pin to A/V adapter, and an iPhone 4 GSM with 7.0.4 jailbroken.\nI was hoping to use iFile to change a setting on the iPhone, but I'll try any solution.\nThank you for the help!\n\nA: It Works!\nI installed Flex per @AndrewLarsson and entered the name of the app that was detecting the external display.\nI then went under UIKit, then searched UIScreen and returned pass-through on displayOut_actualScreens.\nWhen I tested it with my AV adapter, the app did not know that there was an external display connected!\nMany thanks to @AndrewLarsson for his help!

Maybe there is a common way to interact with osx apps visual interface (not so good, but ok). It is needed for personal use.\n\nA: You can do this with Automator. Open Automator and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a workflow\n\n*Add a “Find Calendar Items” action and add it\n\n*Change the first line from “Find events where:” to “Find reminders where:”\n\n*To grab all the reminders change the “Any Content contains ______” to “Title is not ______“ and leave the text field empty.

Why? \nBackground -- When I attempt to sync photos to iCloud, the uploads obviously fail yet no error message is giving. On my iPhone, I can see the pictures sitting in the Photo Steam (queued) but then they disappear from the stream, one by one. In iPhoto, the status bar just reads \"Uploading x Photos\". I can create Photo Streams, but the only thing that syncs is the album, which is left blank. \nAll checkboxes are checked, all permissions are set, and all devices have been updated and restarted. I am using my laptop as a hotspot (Internet Sharing On). My laptop is using the ethernet card, my iPhone connects to my laptop's shared connection.\nI checked my system.log while trying to upload from both my iPhone and iPhoto.

And since inet_set_autoaddr(en1,1) looks like it's telling me my shared network is too busy to handle photos (which is bonk because I send & receive photos through iMessages all day) I suspect if I tried to connect to the internet a different way, I may see something else. But a wired to shared connection is all I have available for now (stuck in Afg).\n\nA: Because this happens to both your devices you have to go with the common factor which is your internet connection.  If your upload speeds are too slow iCloud automatically stops the sync for efficiency.  This will only be resolved with a faster connection.\n", "Q: Why do my most recent iTunes music purchases not sync to my iPhone? For some reason, the last 15 songs or so that I've downloaded won't sync to my iPhone. I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing all music by unchecking \"Sync Music\" (didn't actually remove the music for some reason) and then re-adding it.\n\n*Putting those 15 songs in a playlist and syncing only those 15 songs.\n\n*Rebooting the iPhone.\n\n*Rebooting the computer.\n\n\nNothing has worked so far. Has anyone experienced this and found a solution?\n\nNote:\nThe computer is a Fall 2013 Macbook Pro 13-Inch running OS X 10.9.1 with the latest version of iTunes installed. The iPhone is an iPhone 5S running iOS 7.0.4.\n\nA: I had this exact same problem and found the answer I was looking for within one of the Apple communities. Simply go into iTunes store and scroll right to the very bottom. There amongst the small print you'll see an option for purchased. Click on there and you will see a list of all songs/albums and you can choose to either download all or individual tracks. Once downloaded they appear in your library as normal. Don't ask me why they don't appear straight away, but this resolves the problem of those not transferring when syncing\n\nA: From my own experience after updating to iOS 7 I've had the same problem.\nI fixed this by doing a hardware reset \n\nHold the powerbutton and the homebutton together until the screen turns black and the Apple logo appears on the screen.\n\nAfter that, I was able to sync my music correctly. Also check if you have the latest iTunes version as Apple might have put a fix for this issue in a new version.\nIf that does not work, log out from iCloud on your iDevice and log back in. That fixed the issue for some other people around, it might help you out too!\nPlease also check out This Official Apple Page, as it's filled with 54 pages of this same problem.\n\nA: Are there any music which you didn't purchase using your current Apple ID? Your iTunes should be authorized with the Apple ID the songs are bought.\nIn case you're not sure, connect your iPhone to your PC/MAC, press \"Back-up iPhone\" (in the summary page of your iPhone) in iTunes. It will show you what is preventing iTunes from syncing your iPhone.\n\nA: I suspect that you have already done this, but are the iTunes & App Store Settings set such that you have selected Music under the Automatic Downloads section of those settings? This enables the device to automatically download purchases which have been added by other devices via iCloud. Perhaps you are looking for an iCloud independent solution, in which case this response will be useless. \n\nA: I had the same problem and think I found the answer (without having to plug the iPhone to a computer). Go to iTunes Store > Music. Scroll right down to the bottom. You'll find a \"Purchased\" tab. Click on it and then click on \"Recent Purchases\" and download. \n\nA: I've had the same issues of purchased songs not showing up on all devices and being \"greyed-out\" in the iTunes store.  I found that for some reason the purchases were hidden and I think I've corrected that.\nGo to your Account Info.  Scroll down to see if any of your purchases are \"hidden.\"  I found that over 100 albums had been hidden and correcting it was just a simple step of clicking to \"unhide\" the albums.\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: I discovered that I had purchased a new PC since my last download and the PC wasn't \"authorized\" to receive the transferred purchases. Using \"account\" tab, \"authorizing\", you can verify your PC and then all purchased music downloaded.\n\nA: I had the same issue and it was so silly. \nI had bought Songs off of Drake's new album which has explicit content. \nAnd for some reason explicit content was turned off on  my iphone for music. By stroke of luck i though of this and it worked. \nCheck if your music has the [ E ] sign next to it on the store and if so check to see if the explicit content is set to allow on your device. It worked and the songs were on the phone in a second after that... \n\nA: I've had the same problem and just figured out that I didn't have the \"Use Cellular Data\" option turned to \"ON\" under \"iTunes & App Store\" in Settings. Once I switched it to \"ON\", all of my \"waiting\" music immediately started to download. Hope that helps you!\n", "Q: Email is shown by the sender email ID instead of receiver I made archive folder in outlook and shifted my all \"sent\" emails in that folder. \nWhen I check my sent email in the archive folder, need to find a specific email, all email was shown by the sender email ID instead of the receiver.\nThis is the main problem to find the receiver email ID in an archive folder.\nHow I can arrange it by the receiver email ID.\n\nA: Saved \"Send\" messages do not have the \"To\" (recipient) set as default sorting.\nThey are set by default to the \"From\" (you), so that is why you have that sorting.\nIn order to sort them by the recipient (To) use following:\nArrange by: To:\n\nThen choose the as Default view for that folder here:\n\n", "Q: C compiler with openmp support on Mavericks via Homebrew I need to have a C compiler with openmp support. I installed gcc49 via Homebrew but still the configure script of the library I like to install (nfft) complains: You don't seem to have a C compiler with OpenMP support installed which is required for threaded NFFT. I have the Command Line Tools installed (as this is requested by installing Homebrew). gcc -v delivers Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1\nApple LLVM version 5.0 (clang-500.2.79) (based on LLVM 3.3svn)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin13.0.0\nThread model: posix. So it points to the version in Xcode and seems not to support openmp. On the other hand, gcc49 should support openmp. How do I now get this to work?\n\nA: You called the Xcode gcc which is gcc 4.2 iirc. To use your Homebrew gcc just run gcc-49 and to compile with OpenMP support append -fopenmp.\nExample with g++ for C++11:\ng++-4.9 -fopenmp -std=c++11 omp_code.cpp -o omp_executable\n\nThis should give you insight about gcc and show that it's just a symlink to Xcode's llvm.\nls -la /usr/bin | grep gcc\n\nYou could just change the symlink to your new gcc-49, but you should be careful, as this might break other things for you.\nIf gcc-49 isn't available for you, you still have to add Homebrew to PATH.\nPATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin\nexport PATH\n\nTo permanently add this to your PATH, add these lines to your ~/.bashrc . If you use a different shell, you need to find the right file for it (~/.zshrc for zsh i.e.)\nInvoke 'brew doctor' to see if Homebrew is set up correctly.\n", "Q: Macports: libgnome-keyring taking days (or forever) to build I have upgraded to mavericks and I am following the instructions to upgrade MacPorts, but it is taking days to rebuild libgnome-keyring - I stopped it after three days and deleted it from my \"myports.txt\" file and restarted - and it was reloaded as a dependency and is now in its second day of building.\nIs this behaviour normal?

With Mountain Lion, the following was working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for a file type and name, e.g. to find all Excel sheets named Foo: kind:excel foo\n\n*This would show all Excel sheets where the name includes Foo in the spotlight results.\n\n*If the name of the files was the same, Spotlight would show the name of the containing folder right next to the name of the file.\n\n\nUnfortunately I don't have a screenshot of this available. The displayed name of the containing folder was helpful in deciding which file I wanted.\nIn Mavericks, the folder name is no longer displayed next to the search result - see screenshot.\n\nIs there a way to enable this in Mavericks?\nI know that I can show the file location when hovering over the item in the search results and pressing Cmd, but that's not what I want.\n\nA: Hold down Option and Cmd to get the full path while moving the mouse over the hits.

Wonder if there's a writeable pref to toggle this on by default?\n\nA: 10.9.5 = the following behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hovering over spotlight result opens preview pop-up.\n\n*While hovering, holding CMD alone, look at the bottom of the preview pop-up. You will see it cycle between the path to the result, and, if applicable, the context it based the result on with your search term highlighted.

This plugs into the TV's (DVI/HDMI) port. \nI also have a 15' audio cable plugged into the MAC's headphone port then to the TV's (PC/DVI) audio port.  Nothing works, video or sound.  TV says no signals detected.  MAC doesn't know it's connected. Does anyone have the slightest idea as to what the problem is? Do I somehow have to activate the mini-DVI port?\n\nA: Apparently older Macs don't support audio through HDMI. Audio needs to be transmitted separately through the jack connection on your Mac, just as if attaching speakers.\nThen depending on your TV could be jack or RCA.\n\nA: No, the iMac should auto-detect the external display when it is connected.  I'd try, in order of presumed difficulty:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make certain the correct input is selected on your display.  The lack of audio makes me suspect there's an issue there.\n\n*Make sure your display is set to use the Line-in jacks instead of the HDMI audio stream.\n\n*Boot the iMac with the external display attached and the correct input selected.  \n\n*Check your HDMI cable with another source (perhaps a DVD/Blu-Ray player) do make sure it is working.  \n\n*Check your MiniDP-HDMI adapter on another mac (with the SAME HDMI cable and display, if possible.)  \n\n*Try swapping-in a new MiniDP-HDMI adapter and HDMI cable.\n\n*Try a different external display.\n\n*Consider upgrading your OS X to a newer version (I've used external displays with 10.5, but it's not impossible for the HDMI adapter to need a newer/different driver.)\n\n*Take your iMac to the Genius Bar at your local Apple store and see if they can assist you.\n\n\nAs you start replacing hardware in the equation, feel free to revisit any of the prior steps in the process.\n", "Q: Unmap key combinations in KeyRemap4Macbook This is a follow up to How can I map the Windows key to option in Microsoft Remote Desktop version 8?.

Now, I've been getting the following message: \n\"Word cannot save this document due to a naming or permissions error on the destination volume\"\nI have the latest Office and OSX version.\nWhy is that?\n\nA: This problem appears to be tied to how Word creates temp files when saving changes. The fix appears to be creating a .TemporaryItems directory with global read/write access at the root of the network share.\nCreating a .TemporaryItems directory with global read/write access at the root of the network share should fix it. If a directory with that name already exists, check the permissions on the directory and set it to be globally read/write if needed.\nLinks with more information:\nhttp://prowiki.isc-csg.upenn.edu/wiki/MS_Office_and_Network_Volumes\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20051122213207398\n\nA: I've encountered this before. It's either a permissions conflict or naming error with the file, in which Word (for reasons known only to Word) decides that it cannot save the file with a given name in a given directory. Once it has made this decision, there is no way to resolve it short of restarting Word and/or the computer. Generally when it happens you can't save the file anywhere, but you can copy the file contents out of the document and save it in another program. (I can't tell you why it happens, but at least you can be assured that it doesn't just happen to you.)\n\nA: You can go to the folder, where you want to save the document. Then you do the right click and go to \"Get Info\". Scroll down to the very bottom section \"Sharing & Permissions\". By selecting the arrows choose the option you need --> ('Read & Write'). If it doesn't let you to change this, you have to unlock the keychain, which is on the very bottom of that frame where you see the information about folder ;) \n\nA: I had this issue recentally and found that all the above answers didnt work, but when i disabled realtime protection on MAC AVG Antivirus this allowed me to save.\nHope this works for you.\n\nA: bro go to the \"location\" line under document name when you click save as. its the third line.

I just got a new iMac and I am trying to transfer my music from my old MacBook onto my new iMac. I have all the songs in iTunes Library.\nThank You all\n\nA: If you have all the files in your iTunes library, then simply copy the library folder from its old location to ~/Music (the Music folder in your home folder) on your new account. Launch iTunes and it will detect the library.\nIf you wish to have your library elsewhere, place it somewhere else, then hold ⌥ as iTunes launches for the first time to let you select the library location.\nWith regard to the actual copying of the files, there are a number of ways you can do it. The easiest way may be to copy it over the network — AirDrop or AFP will let you copy the library, albeit pretty slowly. Alternatively, if you have an external drive big enough, you could copy it to that, then move it off onto the new Mac.\n\nA: How big is your library? You could try a DVD or USB stick/drive to copy them across. \nTake a look at Apple's support page...\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht4527\n\nA: Another option is iTunes Match? This basically allows you to keep one universal library across all iTunes.apps where you register with your Apple ID.\nOn the downside though it costs and if it's a one-time problem it's not necessarily worth it.\n", "Q: Where's the US-International keyboard on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)? On my old MacBook Pro, I mostly used the US-International keyboard, which used the Opt key to switch to a  large set of markings.  On my new MacBook Pro with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), I can't find it.  The only \"English\" keyboard has just a few such \"dead keys\", but none of the marks used by eastern-European languages are present.  I've found a number of references to US-International keyboards on Mavericks in various forums, but no clues for how to enable it.  Does anyone here know?\n\nA: I think the keyboard layout you are looking for is \"ABC Extended\" on Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11). If you are on an older version of Mac OS X this keyboard layout is called \"US Extended\", the rest of this answer uses the most recent name but everything else is the same between versions.\nHere is how to enable either \"ABC Extended\" or \"US International-PC\".\n\nIn the Keyboard preference pane, click on the \"plus\" button in the lower left to add a new keyboard layout. Then select \"English\" in the next dialog box, scroll down to the bottom, select \"ABC Extended\" or whatever else you choose, and click \"Add\".\n\nHere are the diacritical \"dead keys\" available in the standard US layout.\n\nAnd here are the many more diacritical \"dead keys\" available in the ABC Extended layout, which provide for Eastern European and Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet, along with other languages as well.\n\nThis screen shot shows the \"option\" keys in ABC Extended.\n\nThis screen shot shows the \"shift-option\" keys in ABC Extended.\nUpdate\nHere are other settings you need to be aware of.\n\nEnable the pull-down menu on the menu bar. I would also un-check the box for \"Automatically switch to a document's input source\" because I find it too confusing in practice. But at least now you know where that setting is located.\n\nIt is also helpful to go to this pane and click the box to enable the Keyboard Viewer, so that you can see an on-screen floating window that shows you all the available diacritical dead keys in the layout that you have selected.\n\nThis is what the menu looks like (with whatever multiple layouts you wish to choose)\n\nHere is where you can enable or disable the custom keyboard shortcuts to rotate among the list of different keyboard layouts which you have selected. I decided to disable these keyboard shortcuts because I found that it was too easy to accidentally rotate among multiple keyboard layouts and I was confusing myself as to which layout I was using at any given time. I would rather use the pull-down menu on the menu bar. It takes more time, but at least I am 100% sure of which keyboard layout I am using at any given moment.\n\nA: As an alternative to US Extended, you could consider the Character Picker, a popup menu which will appear when you hold down the key for a base letter in OS 10.7 and higher. I think the options it offers may cover the languages you need.\n\nA: I seem to have partially \"solved\" the problem, though I don't quite understand how I did even that.  When I tried to follow the above instruction, I did find the \"US Extended\" keyboard setting, but when I selected it, I saw the same 5 dead keys as in the \"U.S.\" keyboard, but none of the others shown above.  I poked around at it for a while, tried varying various settings, with nothing changing, until I suddenly noticed that the \"US International - PC\" keyboard had appeared in the list.\nSo I tried it.  Nope; it also showed the same 5 dead keys, good for French and German (which I use a lot), but not so good for Danish or Czech or Croatian.  then, after wondering where it was all hiding, I decided to take time out and examine a bunch of other language-specific keyboards.  I added languages like Czech, Polish, Croatian, etc. to my list, which already had Russian, Bulgarian, Greek, Hebrew, etc., but no other Latin-based keyboards.  I had them listed on my old machine, but found I never used them, because it was easier to use the US-International keyboard for all of them. \nAfter a while, I went back to the original problem, looked at the \"US Extended\" keyboard -- and it had changed to show all the dead keys I'd had on my old machine.  My first reaction, of course, was \"WTF?\", and then conjectured that turning on those other language-specific keyboards had somehow also changed the \"US Extended\" keyboard in this way.  In fact, this is implicit in the 2nd answer above, though it doesn't explicitly state that the other language keyboards are required for the \"US Extended\" keyboard to support those other language; it merely suggests selecting a few of them.\nBut this doesn't really make sense.  As I understand it (and learned on my old machine), what used to be \"US International\" and now seems to be \"US Extended\" is designed to allow the use of a single keyboard that supports many Latin-based languages, rather than switching keyboards for each of them.  You'd want to use one method or the other, but probably not both.  So why would anyone make the choice you want to use available only if you first choose the one that you don't want to use?\nBut of course I'm not privy to the internal decision-making process at Apple, so I'll probably never understand it.\nI still have to find a solution to a follow-on problem:  For several hours this afternoon, while working in French, I found that opt-6 produced a circumflex as the Keyboard viewer says, but only for i, o and u.  When I tried to use it to get a circumflex over an a or e, it ignored the opt-6 and the following letter, plus several more character, and then returned to normal as if I hadn't typed any of those keys.  About an hour ago, this problem went away, for no reason that I can guess, and â and ê now seem to work fine. But since I don't know what caused and then corrected this, it'll probably happen again.\nAnyway, I should give a tentative thanks for the encouragement via examples of how it's supposed to work.  But the idea that it's all dependent on first selecting a few other languages' keyboards, which you will then ignore after \"US Extended\" finally works as described, is a bit troubling.  I hope I'm interpreting it wrong, and it's not actual that weird.  But I never saw the large set of dead keys until after I did that, so it looks like some sort of enabling trigger was pulled that changed the \"US Extended\" keyboard.\nIt might help if there were an easy way of finding an explanation of it.  Do all customers who use eastern European languages find it this difficult to get it working right?  Or do they all use their \"native\" keyboard?  I know a lot of people who use those languages here in the US; maybe I should ask some of them what they know about it.\n", "Q: Is there any way to make the ipad's front camera view angle wider?

The formerly text-only URLs are now clickable links in TextEdit! But pasting them back into Numbers doesn't work: They appear as unclickable text again.\n\n*Weren't there prefs for that...?\nI thought this option was available in previous versions of Numbers: a check-box in Numbers' preferences, \"Hit enter to go enter the next cell below to edit that cell's content\". I did this in an older Numbers version: While slow, it did the trick: Hit enter (edit the existing text of the highlighted cell), hit return, and boom!

Able to go into safe mode IMac 27\" late 2009, replaced DVD drive with 256Gb SSD, replaced original failed drive with a 2Tb drive. Lived happily ever after for 3 years.\nSo this is started a few days ago. All of a sudden (usually when playing a video from youtube) my machine would completely freeze, except for the cursor which would magically acquire eight horizontal grey lines. \nA reboot would fix it, I could happily work and multitask until I play another video (I'm pretty sure every time this happened I was playing something from Youtube). A reboot fixed it. And then one day a reboot produced this sort of screen:\n\nThe screen is legible enough to be able to select my account and enter my password. Either of two things happen: either the machine simply crashes to black screen and reboots, or it spins a little and then issues me with a multi-language error message saying my Mac has been restarted due to a problem. Then it restarts, and we're back to square one. \nI am able to get into safe mode. Screen works fine (slow refreshes, but no artifacts), the mouse still has the lines. \nI can't get into diagnostics by holding D - the computer simply boots normally. In safe mode, when trying to fix permissions on SSD I get an error message. Doing sudo diskutil repairPermissions / results in:\n\nerror -69789 permissions verify or repair failed underlying error 10\n  posix reports no child processes\n\nSo what can I try doing before dragging my iMac to the curb?\n\nA: So the fugly screen was the result of a burned out video card. I found a replacement (same exact model) online, and performed the surgery on my iMac. The patient lived and video problems went away. Repairing permissions on my SSD drive still don't work, but that's another problem. \n\nA: Quick update. I have read some forums saying its an overheated graphics card. I use SSD Fan Control to stop the fan noise after installing SSD, and there's a note on the SSD Fan Control site that says if it fails under Mavericks to re-install it.\nI'll be trying it tomorrow to see if it helps.\n", "Q: I want to install Windows 7 on an external drive I've read two articles about booting Windows from external drives as opposed to a stock Bootcamp install. Here are the links:\nhttp://kevtg-compuproductive.tumblr.com/\nhttp://bleeptobleep.blogspot.fr/2013/02/mac-install-windows-7-or-8-on-external.html\nThe latter of the two seems more difficult, plus I do not have an external hard drive with USB 3 compatibility, so I think I would use the other one. Though I could just buy a new external drive...\nHas anyone tried these methods? I want to make sure they're legitimate before I try them.\nThanks! :)\n\nA: I'm not sure if you are still looking for an answer, but here it is:\nI haven't tried those specific methods, but I have installed Windows 10 on an external hard drive. It should be the same, although you will need a Windows 7 iso image. \nStep 1: Download a virtual machine to run Windows on. I used VMWare Fusion and used a 30-day trial.\nStep 2: Search \"windows 10 iso image\" and click the first link from Microsoft. Download it.\nStep 3: Open the VMWare application and upload the Windows 10 iso image onto it, and run Windows.\nStep 4: Go on your virtual Windows and download WinToUSB from this: https://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/.\nStep 5: Find and download a Windows 7 iso image. The official Microsoft website has it, but you will need the product key you received when you first installed windows.\nStep 6: Open the WinToUSB tool and upload the .iso image onto it, and choose which version to install. Connect your external drive to your Mac, make sure it connects to VMWare, and select it once it shows up on WinToUSB.\nStep 7: Wait until the tool installs Windows 7 onto the external drive. While this is running, go to the Bootcamp app and ONLY download the Windows Support Software.\nStep 8: Once the WinToUSB tool finishes installing, you can close out of VMWare by shutting down from the virtual Windows. The connected external drive should show up on your mac again, and drag the Windows Support Software folder into the drive.\nYou should now have an external drive with Windows 7 on it, and the Windows Support Software on it as well. You can boot from it by restarting and holding option and choosing the external drive. Use the Windows Support Software to install the correct Apple Drivers in the external drive when inside the Windows 7 boot.\nThis was the method that worked for me on an Early 2014 MacBook Air on High Sierra.\n\nA: For info and future searches ... With steps identical or very similar to those mentionned in the 2nd tuto (BleeptoBleep)\ni managed to install Windows 8.1 on an external SSD /thunderbolt and a late 2015 iMac 5K 27 retina i7 4G but not Windows 7 due to a potential incompatibility (havent found out the reason) with hardware and/or OS El Capitan (boot disk not showing up after \"Alt\" start-up with W7 but OK while OK with W8). Managed W7 installation on an older 2014 MacBook with Yosemite OS though, also on another external drive also bypassing the BCA (bootcamp)\n\nA: I managed to install a Windows 8.1 Pro on a Samsung Portable SSD T1 drive using the following instructions:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/18re5z/run_windows_8_off_usb_on_your_mac/\nFor this purpose, I used a Parallels Desktop virtual machine. Also, since my Windows image file contained a Install.esd file instead of a Install.wim, I had to replace the following command:\n\nImageX.exe /apply D:\\Sources\\Install.wim 1 E:\n\nby:\n\ndism /apply-image /imagefile:D:\\sources\\install.esd /index:1 /ApplyDir:E:\\\n\nI admit that I do not know if the same procedure would work for Windows 7.\n", "Q: Does OSX Mavericks Have an Equivalent to the F11 Show/Hide Shortcut in Snow Leopard? In OSX Snow Leopard, one can push all of the open windows to the side of the screen (revealing the desktop) by pressing F11. Further, by pressing F11 again, all of the windows are returned to their original state. My question is: Does OSX Mavericks have an equivalent shortcut and if so, what is it? (Note that this Snow Leopard shortcut is not enabled by default on portable Macs).\n\nA: First, the keyboard shortcut in 10.6 Snow Leopard (and almost all versions of OS X) for Expose \"Show Desktop\" is not F11 unless you have 'Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys' clicked in System Preferences > Keyboard.\nIt's actually, by default fn-F11. Exactly the same as it is in 10.9 Mavericks. I suspect that under 10.6 you had the System reversing the standard by clicking the above and got used to that and 10.9 is set to the default where F11 adjusts the volume. Try fn-F11 and it should work. Of course if you want it the other way round then change it in System Preferences.\n\nA: It should be the same keyboard shortcut by default. If not, then it's probably function+F11\n", "Q: Mavericks Dock icons have become corrupted. Is there a cache to flush or a database to rebuild? I'm running OS X Mavericks 10.9.1. Some of my Dock icons for running applications, including the Finder icon, now appear blank and empty, or as a square filled with random noise pixels.\nI have tried \"Verify Disk\" in Recovery mode, and it detects no errors. I have Repaired Permissions and rebooted.\nIs there some cache to flush or database to rebuild that could fix this seemingly harmless but annoying anomaly?\n\nA: In case you don't want to use some \"cache cleaner app\" then just try doing it manually from the terminal with these three commands followed by a reboot:\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \\;\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \\;\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store\nor\nAlternatively a single boot into Safe Mode once could/should clear out some caches.\nWorked For Me™ in Sierra (10.12)\n\nA: I used a utility (CleanMyMac 2) to flush all the User and System cache files, and when I rebooted, the problem seems to have been solved.\nSo I don't know which specific cache needed flushing, but everything looks good now.\nAnd yes, I could have done this with Terminal commands, but I prefer to use something with a GUI.\n\nA: Wheat,\nIf it was my Mac I'd start by clearing all the caches with AppleJack. This is a great utility for this sort of task.\n", "Q: How can I change default print preference to black and white, system wide? I would like to make my printer print b&w as default from every application on my mac. How do I do this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to http://localhost:631/printers\n\n*Select your printer from the list.\n\n*Choose Set Default Options from the Administration drop-down.\n\n*Set the options you would like as default.\n", "Q: Connect Wi-Fi Hotspot Through OSX Internet I have a question regarding creating a wifi hotspot using a router or a wifi card with a MacBook Pro running OSX 10.9.  Is it possible to create a hotspot using a separate wifi card or router? The connection coming into my device is also wifi.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This should trivial to do using something like an Airport Express (or Airport Extreme, though I haven't personally done it there). The method I've used involves activating Internet Sharing from the Sharing Preference pane, selecting Wi-Fi for the signal source and Ethernet (or the second Wi-Fi card, if it's set up as a network interface in the Network pref pane) for the check box for \"To computers using:\".\nSharing Wi-fi -> Ethernet and Ethernet-> Wi-Fi has always worked fine for me using this method, ever since 10.3 or 10.4. \n", "Q: What is Ethernet Adaptor (wc5) In my Network Preferences panel, I've just noticed a network type I didn't see before.\nThe name is \"Ethernet Adaptor (wc5)\" (note it says Adaptor and not Adapter). It has an IP, it's yellow, and it says \"Ethernet Adaptor (wc5) has a self-assigned IP address and will not be able to connect to the Internet.\"\nWhat is it? Where does it come from? I am connected via WiFi - and, probably not a coincidence, I have internet issues right now (some sites work some don't). \nWhat is happening?\nEDIT: Disabled this network adapter, and now Internet flies. I don't know what it is and how it got there...\n\nA: The (wc5) is probably from Wirecast. Do you have it installed?\nIt may have added an interface so it can stream and grabbed what it thought was an Ethernet interface but was actually your WiFi interface.\n", "Q: Which Mac OS X versions support lsof command? I want to know which Mac OS X versions support the lsof command. Does Mac OS X 10.5 support it?\n\nA: lsof has been available since OS X 10.5. From the manual page :\n   Lsof  revision 4.87 lists on its standard output file information about\n   files opened by processes for the following UNIX dialects:\n\n        Apple Darwin 9 and Mac OS X 10.[567]\n\n", "Q: Writing a shell script (or something similar) that will execute some commands For my work I use an app called Sublime Text to edit website documents. To open my project in sublime text I drag the folder above the icon and it opens it up in sublime text.\nMy next step is to run a nodejs script, and after it's run open chrome and navigate to a local url.\nMy question is - how can I automate that process - meaning I will have a script that I run (command line is fine) that will open the project in sublime text, run the nodejs script (which starts a local web server), open safari to a url.\nIs that possible?\nThanks\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. The two best options for stitching together Mac applications are AppleScript and Automator.\nGiven your steps, consider exploring the included Automator application: Applications > Automator.app\nApple's Mac Basics: Automator support note is a good starting point.\nThe following Actions are likely to help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display Webpages for opening your default browser and showing a URL\n\n*Run Shell Script for interacting with node.js\n\n*Open Finder Items for opening documents in Sublime Text\n\n\nA: You can write a bash script. Bash script is like windows batch file.\nHere is a little example. Open sublime text and type in:\n#!/bin/bash\nopen -a \"Sublime Text 2\"\nnode scriptname.js\nopen -a \"Safari\" http://localhost\n\nSave it as script.sh\nThen open the terminal and navigate to script folder. Type in next command and hit enter:\nchmod u+x script.sh\n\nthen run it:\n./script.sh\n\nMore at bash scripts here and here.\n\nA: Something like this should be fine:\nopen -a /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/ Folder/ && node script.js && open http://localhost:80\n\nReplace Folder/ with folder path and script to the nodejs script path.\n\nA: You can save the script with a .command extension: this gives you a file you can \"double-click\" to open it as an application.\nBoth way's (use .sh or .command as an extension), you have to make the script executable with chmod in Terminal: chmod u+x ~/MyScript.sh.\n", "Q: Maverick and adobe CS6 - is there any definitive answer? I'm on an iMac 2.7GHz i5, 16Gb RAM 1600MHz, mountain lion.\nI use regularly licenced CS6, especially photoshop, illustrator and acrobat pro.\nI'd like to upgrade to mavericks, but frankly, on the web there are too much rumors that this or that won't work then... I use my imac to work, I'm a freelance web developer, so I cannot have problems on my machine. It must work.\nSo, is there any DEFINITE answer to this issue? Apart to definitely stop using adobe products (I'll do it..).\nthank you!\n\nA: Yes CS6 works, and also please check out these notes by Adobe, about compatibility for Mavericks.\nI've got a CS6 myself and do not see anything going wrong with it. And since Adobe claims to be fully compatible with the products you name in your question you should be fine too.\n", "Q: Sound effects for commands completing in inactive tabs/windows I think my life would be that much better if a subtle sound effect was played when a task completed in a terminal window/tab that's not the current one. It'd be even better if an exit code 0 sounded different to any other exit code.\nIs there any way to make this happen?\n(I often start little scripts in a window, like uploading a file to a server, then switch to another tab to do something on the server. It'd be great to hear when the file has arrived.)\n\nA: It's certainly achievable if you're using scripts, I often use\ntput bel\n\nat the point where work is complete. This will not only beep the terminal but put a badge on the dock icon as well.\nIn terms of handling exit codes then you can string a couple together for a different sound:\nif command_or_exit_status\nthen\n# exit OK\n        tput bel\nelse\n# not ok\n        tput bel; tput bel;\nfi\n\n", "Q: Can't download apps on IPad 2 Whenever I go to try and download an app it tells me that I have already purchased it and don't need to pay again then the download stops.

I updated my php on Mavericks using the php_osx and the instructions stated to use export PATH=/usr/local/php5/bin:$PATH to have the new php version used.\nThrough my attempt to update php I found references to the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*.bash_profile - I can not find this file.\n\n*.bashrc\n\n*paths\n\n*path_helper\n\n\nCan someone please provide a simple understanding of how $PATH is created in Mavericks and help me understand where the export command put the edition to the path and how would I remove it if I want too?\n\nA: On OS X you'll have following :  \nThe base PATH used is located in /etc/paths. It is used to set $PATH. \nBy default, the file contains : \n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n/usr/local/bin\n\nIt will also load the paths located in /etc/path.d/. \nWhen opening the terminal I will load : \n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bash_profile \n\n*~/.bash_login, (if .bash_profile doesn't exist)\n\n*~/.profile (if .bash_login doesn't exist). \n\n\nThese files can load some other files, for example .bashrc. \nIf you want to expand your path you can do it in one of the files by adding your  export command you gave in your question.\n", "Q: How to disable Notification for Terminal app? When i am starting a new server from the Terminal app, and i have the window not active, the Dock icon \"jumps\" up and down, also called \"notifies me\". \nI don't want this behaviour, i want a quiet Terminal. I know when i am starting and stopping sth. \n\nHow can i do that?\n\nI've already disabled the audio and visual bell, but still: Jumping.\nSystem version: Mavericks. \n\nA: Whilst it's not ideal, if it's that bad you could disable the app bounce notification completely for all apps:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool TRUE && killall -HUP Dock\n\nTo revert, replace TRUE with FALSE.\nYou can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n\nA: I am running the Terminal version 2.9.1 and macOS Mojave 10.14.3 and I could just do this in the preference setting of the Terminal App:\nTerminal > Preferences > Profiles tab > Advanced tab > Uncheck everything under the Bell section\nUnchecking 'Bounce app icon when in background' option would prevent jumping of the terminal icon.\n\n\nA: Running your commands in gnu screen can solve your problem.\nSteps to replicate bad behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*$ sleep 5; tout bel\n\n*Command-Tab away from Terminal\n\n*Wait\n\n\nObserved behavior: Terminal icon gets badge and bounces\nDesired behavior: No badge or bounce\nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*$ screen\n\n*Control+A, c # create a new screen window\n\n*$ sleep 5; tput bel\n\n*Control+A, Control+A # switch to screen 0\n\n*Command-Tab away from Terminal\n\n\nNew observed behavior: No badge or bounce\nNote that you'll still get badge + bounce if the screen window is the active one. I'm sure you can refine this further.\n\nA: If you're just issuing one long-running command that occasionally pops a bell, you could run the command with the output piped to less. This seems to have done the trick for me:\nannoyingcmd | less -R\n\n(The -R flag allows for colors to be displayed)\n", "Q: 2011 MacBook Pro monitor as a 2nd display for Windows 7 (Display port) laptop How can I use my 2011 MacBook Pro monitor as a 2nd display for my Windows 7 Lenovo Laptop (Display port)?\n\nA: iMac's support what is known as Target Display Mode. However, this is limited to iMac's only, Macbook Pro laptops do not support this.\nAlternatively, you can use your Macbook Pro as a secondary monitor by using an app such as Air Display.\nAir Display is an app that will allow another shared desktop to display on it, over wifi.  However, if you are doing any critical photo, video or even games, you will find the lag to be very annoying.\n\nA: ScreenRecycler - Share Displays\nYou can not use your MacBook Pro as a second monitor for your Windows computer without additional software. For Mac using a Windows computer, there is software such as ScreenRecycler:\n\nUse your other computer as an additional display for your Mac.\nRecycle your old iMac, PowerBook or even Windows PC now.\n\nI am not aware of the reverse piece of software to go from Windows to Mac.\n\nSynergy - Combine Computers\nAlternatively, Synergy is an open source solution that lets you combine multiple computers into one. It will let you use both computers from a single keyboard and mouse.\n\n\nA: I haven't tried it (not supported for Win8--good for them!), but Maxivista seems to be a solution for using a MacBook/iMac as a monitor for your PC. From the demo, it seems you still need Screen Recycler on your Mac (~$29), (other reqs: VNC and both computers need to be on the same network).\n", "Q: How to monitor output sound from terminal Is it possible to read current volume or frequency of outgoing sound from terminal? I am using OS X Mavericks\n\nA: You can get the volumes of the currently selected input, output and sound effects/alert device as a percentage value with an AppleScript one liner:\nosascript -e \"(get volume settings)\"\n\nwhich gives something similar to:\noutput volume:56, input volume:63, alert volume:28, output muted:false\n\n", "Q: iCloud Photos process restarting continuously I noticed in Activity Monitor that the iCloud Photos process is stopping and restarting a few times every minute.

I don't use iCloud in any way and all of the iCloud services are unchecked in the System Preferences.\n\nA: I think I've resolved this by installing iPhoto (fortunately I had paid for it before when I wanted to use it before changing my mind), enabling Photo Stream in the iCloud Systems section (without iPhoto I couldn't do this), leave it for a minute then disable Photo Stream.  The iCloud Photos process disappeared from Activity Monitor and has stayed away.\nIt's odd that the preferences could get messed up if you don't want iCloud, but sometimes writing the in-correct settings followed by the correct one clears the bad setting.\n\nA: Go to iPhoto → Preferences → Photo Stream and disable Automatic Import.\n", "Q: Automator get first 3 letters of parent folder How do i get the first 3 letters of the parent folder im creating a folder in with automator\nim designing a Automator service to create a project folder in the folder of a client and I want to append the first three letters of that clients folder name to the next folder. \nClient folder: Coca-Cola > new project_COC \nhow do i append the first three letters of Coca-Cola (COC) in capital to the new folder.\n\nA: As an Example on how to get the  3 chars.:\nYou can get the details from some unix code that gets the folder name from parents path and gets the first 3 letters and transforms it into upper case.\nPasses it on to the storage var. to use in the Make folder or what ever you use.\n\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    sufx=`basename \"$f\" |cut -c-3 | tr \"[a-z]\" \"[A-Z]\"`\n\necho _\"$sufx\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: MBPR 13\" Late 2013. Two identical SSDs (different revs.) - one boots, one doesn't? I have a new MacBook Pro 13\" Retina (Late 2013) which works flawlessly. It has a factory installed 512 GB SSD, which also works flawlessly. Then I bought basically the same type of 512 GB SSD, 2nd hand but new, which I intended to install in another MacBook Pro Retina Late 2013.\nThe seller told me it is compatible with the MBP Retina Late 2013, but when installed, the known to be good MBPR doesn't boot. Not from that SSD, not from an attached USD HDD which has two perfectly bootable Mavericks partitions. When pressing the alt-Key on booting, I can however see two partitions on that SSD (Mac OS X 10.8.4 and a Recovery Partition), yet it is not booting at all, thus also doesn't allow me to inspect or treat this SSD with Disk Utility or other tools.\nAll I get is the grey screen with the striked through circle sign (see attached image). I've tried both, PRAM reset and SMC reset, no change.\nHere comes the interesting part: Although both SSD look absolut identical, they have slightly different model and part numbers (see attached image).\nWorking, factory installed SSD: Model MZ-JPUS512T/0A6. Part No. 665-1805D\nNon-booting, 2nd hand SSD: Model MZ-JPUS512T/0A2. Part No. 665-1805A\nAny ideas what’s going on here and how to solve this?\n\n\n\nA: Stupid me! A fellow over at Apple Discussions pointed me into the right correction: Mac OS X 10.9.1 just doesn't equal Mac OS X 10.9.1.\nThe Mac OS X 10.9.1 on the external USB HDD had been installed using a different, older MacBook, thus just wasn't compatible with this MBPR. Back in the bad old days of Mac OS X Install DVDs, I was aware of the fact that there where different versions of the OS X Installer testing against the Mac ID to make sure that bundled versions gets only installed on those Macs which the DVD came with. And the DVD where clearly labeled in that sense.\nNow in the days of Internet download and installation from USB sticks, SSD and HDD, one completely forget about this. On the other hand, with Mavericks being free, I don’t understand the need for such limitations, and not at least the recovery partition allows booting any Mac which supports Mavericks.\nWhen you boot with the alt-Key pressed and you see at least one partition with Mac OS X 10.9.1, one just doesn’t understand why the heck the Mac doesn’t boot. Now I do. Apple would be well advised to simply add a short info line, like „This version of Mac OS X is missing components to boot this Mac. Please re-install from the AppStore using this computer“. It would take out A LOT of guesswork.\nAnyhow… I booted the MBPR using the working SSD, installed Mavericks from the AppStore on the external USB HDD, switched the SSDs, booted from the external USD HDD’s now bootable 10.9.1 Recovery Partition, wiped the suspicious non-booting SSD and installed Mavericks. No further problems. Another option would be to simply boot into Internet Recovery Mode by pressing CMD-alt-R when powering up.\n\nA: If you boot in to recovery mode you will be able to use your Disk Utility in order to check your drive, should be as simple as that!\ncmd + r as soon as you hear the start up chime, or your screen is gray \n", "Q: Crestron XPanel app crashes before establishing the connection I’m looking for some help with this crash log I have. I’m trying to see if anyone can help me trace what can be causing this app to crash, therefore fixing my problem.\nI have a remote iMac running Lion 10.7.5 which is used to control a Crestron system in the apartment, among other basic things – email, browsing the web, setting up my calendar and that’s pretty much it. No heavy usage, gaming or any crazy software installed on it.\nThe XPanel app is pretty simple and straight forward to use. You actually can’t do much with it, it’s basically an interface to connect and control your main Crestron controller via a .xpnl file which holds the server IP, ports, user/pass, etc. It never gave me any issues in the past, although few months ago it just stopped working.\nI would double click my .xpnl file to establish the connection and wait for it to load all the controls but immediately before it finishes connecting, XPanel would crash and a Crash Report was generated – which I’ll attach to the post. It also started to crash on a second Mac I have, this one with Mavericks 10.9.1.\nA call to their “True Blue Support” wasn’t much of a help. Basically they pinpointed the issue being with the OS and told me to bring the computer to the Apple Store. \nBecause the crash is happening only on these two machines and I was able to re-create the connection on other Macs, they will not debug the error or even take a look on the issue.\nSo to the Genius Bar I took off…long story short…Of course they wouldn’t admit it was an OS X issue and told me to contact Crestron tech support. As a “courtesy” they ran tests, diagnostics, basic repairs and etc - which did not solve the problem. As a possible solution they suggested to re-load the OS. Back to the office I end up doing just that – both machines got their OS reloaded and voila, XPanel started working again.\nAnd it worked for a few months until a couple of days ago when stopped working again and crashing just like before. One possibility I see going on here is that someone is doing some “cleaning” on the system or running some tool/app to delete temporary files, cache, or something like that and breaking whatever XPanel needs to properly function. Of course when I asked around the office nobody knows anything about it, nobody touched the machine, nobody cleaned anything and so on.

I edited the post to show you the relevant thread 0 that was responsible for the crash (if you trust the logs and in this case, everything seems normal and this is a user program crash, so it's generally more reliable than a kernel log).\nThree things can be done to reduce or eliminate the crash:\n\n\n*\n\n*Figure out what part of the drawing code is responsible for the crash over time and reduce / eliminate that part of the program by not using it.\n\n*Get the source code and fix it (it could also be an Apple Bug where you need to update the OS or even upgrade to really fix the issue.) Only someone with access to the source code generally can make that call.\n\n*Change the data the program uses (remove some settings, features, etc) and hope that it reduces the chance the program has to draw the same data in the crashing routine.\n\n\nAlso, there is a 4th item - it could be a somewhat random occurrence. Unless you can discover how to make things crash each and every time, it's best to keep a paper (or other) log of when it crashes and save the logs. After about 10 times patterns usually start to form that help you know what is causing a crash.\n", "Q: Two-finger scrolling stops working after a while I am running into a strange problem. After a few minutes of using Chrome or Firefox, two finger scrolling on my trackpad stops working on these applications.\nEvery time I restart these applications two finger scrolling scrolling works again, but then after a few minutes, it stops working. All my other gestures work fine (one, three and four finger movements) except two-finger scrolling. \nI have no idea what is causing this. I haven't had this problem before until today.\nI am working on the latest version of Mavericks on the latest MacBook Pro.\nAny thoughts? \n\nA: A simpler solution that seemed to work for me in Firefox:\nopen about:config\nand then find the properties\nbrowser.gesture.swipe.left\nbrowser.gesture.swipe.right\n\nand set them from Browser:BackOrBackDuplicate and Browser:ForwardOrForwardDuplicate to empty. It's a workaround for a known bug ( https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=927702 ).\n\nA: Two-finger scroll stopped working for me after awaking from a low-battery induced hibernate/sleep. I was able to fix the problem by manually going into sleep and then back out of sleep.\n\nA: This is a defect that is caused by trying to use the two finger gesture to swipe between pages.  In Chrome/FF it's supposed to go back and forward in the history, but if there is no history, then it will cause an error and prevent any future scrolling via the trackpad.  \nA reproduction of the issue and a fix can be found in this video on Scroll Not Working Mac OS X Mavericks in Chrome / Firefox (*loud intro)\nTo fix it, as long as you're not married to two finger page swiping, you can go to System Preferences > Trackpad > and then disable Swipe Between Pages:\n\nQuitting out of chrome and restarting will always restart the trackpad.\nIf you want to leave it broken, but still have the ability to scroll, you can go to System Preferences > General > and Show Scroll Bars always.\n\n\nA: Go to Apple --> System Preferences --> Accessibility. Choose \"Mouse & Trackpad\" from the left column, and click on the \"Trackpad Options...\" button in the right window. Make sure that the box called \"Scrolling\" is checked. In my case this was not checked and I couldn't use two-finger scrolling in any window or application.\n\nA: Warning: This may remove much more than you need!\nThis solution works but first you have to Enable Hidden Folders to be seen (using your preferred method - I recommend Deeper).\nFrom https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5468141?start=30&tstart=0:\n\nClose all applications, if you want, you may do so by pressing cmd + alt + esc and selecting each application and clicking on the \"Force Quit\".\nThen you have to disconnect all external devices (USB, Firewire, etc ...) and any network cables.\nThen you have to disable the Wi-Fi connection.\nThen must click the Go button, located next to the Finder on the top bar.\n  Click on \"Computer\".\nThen in the window that opens has to click on \"Library\".\nNow you have to locate the folder Preferences> SystemConfiguration and open it.\nThen you have to empty the contents of that folder. If you want you can make a copy first on the desktop.\nThen you have to restart your Mac and immediately after the black screen reboot must press this key combination: cmd + alt + P + R, and hold them until they hear the \"dong\" of the start three times in a row.\n  After that you can safely release.\n  And everything should go ok \n\n", "Q: How to toggle Target Display Mode on iMac using a non-mac wired keyboard? I have a new Late 2013 rMBP and a Mid 2011 iMac. I want to use the iMac in Target Display Mode so I can operate it as a second monitor for the laptop.\nI have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can easily turn on TDM on the iMac using ⌘ Cmd+F2, but cannot turn it off the same way. I have to unplug the Thunderbolt cable. Anyone know why?\n\n*I only have one Apple keyboard and mouse, and both are bluetooth wireless. Right now they are paired to the iMac. I will instead pair them to the laptop so I can use them on that, but I need a keyboard that can toggle TDM on the iMac. I tried using a Dell keyboard (which in my experience, Apple treats the ⊞ Win as the ⌘ Cmd key) and using ⊞ Win+F2, but it doesn't toggle it. Is there any hope to use a non-Apple keyboard to toggle TDM on the iMac?\n\n\nA: To your 2nd question: I've not been able to toggle target display mode with a non-apple keyboard, however I was able to accomplish this using the app 1Keyboard. Basically I paired the computers via bluetooth, then used 1Keyboard to send command+F2. Sending command+F2 via Apple Remote Desktop did not work. I also tried sending command+F2 programmatically, but that didn't work either. Glad to have found a solution. Both computers were running Mavericks.\n\nA: I am new to Mac and have experience both these issues, I hopefully can shed some light on the first question, but have not yet found an answer to question 2.\nTo turn off TDM on my late 2013 iMac (connected to a late 2011 macbook pro) I have to type in my iMac password followed by cmd +F2 - its a bit of hit and miss, but it is the only way I can get TDM to turn off without unplugging or turning off.\n\nA: VirtualKVM from duanefields on Github is free and easy to use. From the README for the project:\n\nUseful for those who use their iMac as a monitor for their Macbook.\nAutomatically toggles off your iMac's Bluetooth and turns on Target\n  Display Mode when you connect a Macbook via Thunderbolt.\nTo use, simply run. Might want to run at startup. When you plug your\n  notebook into your iMac via Thunderbolt, this extention will\n  automatically switch the iMac to Target Display Mode, allowing you to\n  use your iMac as a monitor.\nIn addition, it will turn off the Bluetooth on the iMac, freeing up\n  your mouse and keyboard to pair with your notebook. When you unplug\n  the notebook, the iMac's Bluetooth will be powered back up and the\n  monitor restored.\nIf you install it on your Macbook, the opposite happens. When you\n  connect to the iMac the Macbook's Bluetooth will turn on, and then off\n  again when you disconnect.\nQuit and control options from the status bar menu.\n\n", "Q: Keep Time Machine from starting in home Lately, when I \"Enter Time Machine\" (like, to recover a lost file), it switches to my home directory. This might have started with Mavericks, or possibly when I set up the current laptop (about, though not exactly, the same time). Is that a new feature with Mavericks? Is it some configuration thing?\nMainly: how do I make it stop? It prevents restoring files in hidden directories.\n\nA: I tested this on Mavericks, but this method has worked as far as I can remember. Make sure \"Show Time Machine in menu bar\" is checked in Time Machine Preferences. Select the directory you want to go to as a Finder window and make it the active window. Select use \"Enter Time Machine\" from the menu bar Time Machine (small clock) drop down menu. Time Machine will open to your selected directory ready to restore files. If you start at a \"hidden\" directory you can restore from there.\n\nA: I used ls -lO to find all the hidden directories, then used chflags nohidden to unhidify them, and now I can get in with TimeMachine (it acts the same as for regular directories).\nI fear the next update or Repair Permissions will break this, but I should be able to restore things (if I can remember this trick!)\n\nA: I don't know how to prevent time machine from opening the first window in your user home folder. However, you can use the Go to Folder... Finder shortcut to choose your preferred folder once the star field ui has rendered itself. \n\n\n*\n\n*Command-Shift-G\n\n", "Q: does going to the itunes store app to sign out also sign you out of your icloud account?

I have a Mac Mini 10.6.8 for which I've used Screen Sharing frequently. This is NOT a headless Mac. A monitor is attached, it is on and it works fine.\nSometime this week I connected as I always do (Finder -> Connect to Server -> vnc://targetmac.mydomain.edu) only to be greeted with a black screen.\nSitting next to the Mini I can verify from my laptop (10.6.8) that screen sharing works. I can type commands on my laptop and they are executed on the Mini. This is simply a display issue. I know that Screen Sharing is turned on, that I have permissions to connect and that it works. I'm just blind. \nInterestingly, my laptop's trackpad movements are NOT transmitted to the Mini. Only keystrokes.\nI've tried setting the Screen Sharing app on the Mini to run in 32-bit mode (per this Tidbits article). Tried setting the Screen Sharing on my laptop to 32-bit mode. No dice.\nI've tried toggling adaptive quality and full quality. I've tried toggling the Screen Sharing service itself. No dice.\nI can connect to an identical Mini (bought the same day, running same OS) from my laptop, so I'm pretty sure this isn't my machine. I've verified that someone using another mac has the same results, so it seems unlikely to be something in my preferences related to this particular Mini.\nWhat the heck? \nCould this be some weird video card issue that only affects VNC? Seems unlikely. The most obvious explanation is that the bug mentioned in the Tidbits article was reintroduced, but I'd expect to see other machines similarly affected.\nEdit: Ahhh, interesting ... ssh only partly works. I can shell in, use cd and ls ... but if I ps the session hangs once the output fills my laptop's terminal window. Similarly, if I attempt to vi a new file, it hangs after vi clears my laptop's terminal window. This may be a subtle networking thing after all.\n\nA: The last edit was the primary clue ... it was not a VNC-only issue, but a intermittent network issue.\nWe had a small 5-port hub in the room to support three machines off of the one network drop. Once we removed the hub and plugged the machine directly into the drop all was good. The hub had been there, trouble-free, for more than 3 years.\nOnce again I am reminded to ask myself more questions. An obvious question would have been: Does the target Mini have good connection to the network, outside of VNC/SSH? Is it dropping packets to reliable servers?\n", "Q: How to script a logout while screen is locked? I want to log out a user via a shell script, after a delay. However, there's a few other issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*User does not have admin and/or root.\n\n*Logout must complete even if screen is locked.\n\n\nCurrently, I'm using the shell commands below to log out:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to log out'\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke return'\n\nThis works fine if the screen is active, but if the screen is locked, this fails, because it depends on triggering a window, and then firing an Enter keystroke. As a reminder, techniques like killing loginwindow fail because they require root.\nI'm not convinced it's possible; any ideas would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Can you get system events to do Shift-Option-Command-q ?? \nsomething like...

I've been using Microsoft Office for mail merge and it is fraught with character encoding issues. I'm curious if there is another solution for mail merge besides Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac. I've got a homegrown solution I use too, but looking for something more robust. It would be nice if it supported HTML formatted messages.\n\nA: 1-use Mailchimp (mailchimp.com) it has all the bells and whistles: address list management, import lists from a variety of formats, reports, subscribe/unsubscribe, drag & drop html layouts, etc. etc. All of this in their free product.\n2-Go LibreOffice (https://help.libreoffice.org/Writer/Mail_Merge_Wizard).

This answer may not be the best solution, but may be a good starting point and I hope it adds value.\nAppleScript with Pages, Contacts and Apple Mail\n(Taken from iWorkAutomation)\nAppleScript automation, involving three OS X applications: Contacts, Pages, and Mail, that will create and mail encrypted PDF files generated from a Pages template containing text placeholders.\nBasic gist of the workflow:\nIn the Contacts application, create a default card containing the Mail Merge sender’s data. Include First Name, Last Name, eMail address, Mailing Address, and Phone Number. Make the card the default card by choosing Make This My Card from the Card menu.\nFor testing the script, create small Contacts group containing four to five people. The data requirements for the recipient contacts are: First Name, Last Name, and eMail Address. By default Mailing Address is optional for recipients. Individual Contacts entries with incomplete required data will be skipped.\nCreate a Pages document.\nNOTE: The default set of text placeholders used by the script, such as SENDERFIRSTNAME and recipientLastName, can be customized by editing the properties at the top of the script.\nThe only requirement for their design, is that a placeholder must be a unique continuous string of text characters, not found as part of other words, and that a placeholder not contain spaces, numbers, hyphens, punctuation, or word delimiters.\nOpen the script in the AppleScript Editor application and run the script.

I have a 13″ mid 2009 MacBook Pro. \nFor a long time now my browsers just decide to stop working. The 1st occasion Safari kept crashing every 10 minutes so I downloaded Firefox but after a while the same thing kept happening.\nI thought it was something to do with Flash so I downloaded a newer version of Flash but that didn't solve anything. I then downloaded Chrome which was fine for a while but now from time to time any browser I use just stops working. I find myself either having to switch my wifi off and on and restart which ever browser I'm using or if that doesn't work, when Safari stops working I switch to Chrome and vice versa. \n\nA: The first step in narrowing this down is to look at the crash log and the event log in Console.app (under /Applications/Utilities) to look for relevant error messages. \nUsually it is a dns related error, but if that doesn't work, then run the network diagnostics to make sure it isn't just a web browser issue. \n\nA: I have the same issue, but I found that the cause of it is the apple mail app.\nOnce I quit apple mail the browsers start working again with no issue, then I relaunch apple mail and all is good for about an hour then it starts again.\nNot sure why apple mail is doing this.\n", "Q: Convert audio to OGG format via Terminal Is there an app or a method that I can use from Terminal to convert audio files to the OGG format?\nI know about afconvert but that doesn't provide the ogg format that I want.\n\nA: Ogg is a container format. It typically uses the Vorbis audio codec. You can download a static build of ffmpeg and use the bundled libvorbis encoder:\nffmpeg -i input.wav -c:a libvorbis -qscale:a 5 output.ogg\n\nAccording to the Vorbis encoding guide, the quality range is from 0–10, where 10 is the highest quality and 3–6 are a good range to try. In the above example we used 5 as quality.\n\nA: I've come across this question a couple of times, this is what worked for me:\n$ ffmpeg -y -i foo.mp3  -strict -2 -acodec vorbis -ac 2 -aq 50 foo.ogg\n\nSource: http://infoheap.com/ffmpeg-convert-mp3-to-ogg-on-mac/\n\nA: have a look at sox and ffmpeg they should do it.\nffmpeg -i file.mp3 -acodec ogg file.ogg\n\ni think that was the command i used. not sure used to be a long time ago.\nalso have a look here why you probably wont do a conversion: https://askubuntu.com/questions/147944/bulk-batch-convert-mp3-files-to-ogg-via-command-line\n", "Q: How to share .bash_profile between different users in the same group? I have searched by google but cannot find a right solution.The scenario is like this: in my mac, there are two users, lets say user1, user2. these two users are in the same group, which is staff actually.\nNow in user2, there is a .bash_profile for user2's terminal, can i share this profile with the user1? I know i can copy one from user2 to user1. but if i copy one, when there is something changed in user2, i have to copy it again. I wonder whether there is a way to share it with user1?\n\nA: i work it out by using command ln -s /Users/user2/.bash_profile /Users/user1/.bash_profile. \nBut by only this command, i can only change the .bash_profile in user2. in user1, you can only use the file in the read-only mode. Then i check the .bash_profile privilege in user2. its rw-r--r--. So i do chmod 664 /Users/user2/.bash_profile. Finally i can share the .bash_profile in different users.\n", "Q: Backup a bootable partition with rsync I use rsync to create a backup of my boot partition (Mavericks).\nEverything is OK (during the backup) but the backup partition does not boot (it seems to loop infinitely).\nI think I used the correct arguments to rsync, included the following\noptions:\n--hfs-compression and --protect-decmpfs\nAny ideas?\n(of course, I used bless to make it bootable)\n\nA: Repair the permissions has allowed to solve the problem. The backup partition is now booting without any problem.\n\nA: Use CarbonCopyCloner (http://www.bombich.com) it's a masterpiece by Mr. Bombich. It uses rsync as the backup engine and takes care of all the nitty gritty re blessing, recovery partitions, etc. etc. You can do full partitions or just selected folders and files.

It has one big partition which is a Time Machine target, and the backup is encrypted.

Here's my problem, I have a PDF document 583KB, and I want to make it under 500KB so I can upload it. What should I do?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the PDF in Preview.\n\n*Go to File → Save As… (⌥⇧⌘S)\n\n*Select Reduce File Size as the Quartz Filter\n\nApple recommends this method in the KB article Mac OS X 10.6: Compressing a PDF file.\n\nA: You might try adding a custom filter.\nReference: http://www.hoboes.com/Mimsy/hacks/quality-reduced-file-size/\n\nThe PDF file was nearly 20 megabytes. After saving it with Reduce File\n  Size, it was down to under one megabyte... but the quality of the\n  images was so bad that they didn’t serve to illustrate the concepts in\n  the text.\nIt was obvious what was happening, and I knew that when saving JPEG\n  files you are allowed to trade off low file size with increased\n  quality. But there was no slider available in the Quartz Filter menu\n  to increase the quality of the image.\nThe answer, it turns out, is in ColorSync Utility in the Utilities\n  folder off of the Applications folder. ColorSync Utility can create\n  new Quartz filters. Open up ColorSync Utility and switch to the\n  “Filters” pane. This will list all of the filters that you currently\n  have available.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*In the lower left, click on the “+” button. This creates a new filter.\n  \n*Give the filter a name, and press return.\n  \n*To the right of the filter’s name, choose the down arrow. A menu will pop up.\n  \n*From the pop-up menu, choose “Add Image Effects Component”, and from that menu choose “Image Compression”.\n  \n*Adjust the image compression Mode to JPEG.\n  \n*Adjust the image compression quality however you prefer.\n  \n*The next time you use Preview to “Save As...”, you'll have a new option under Quartz filters.\n  \n  \n  \n[...] after you create the filter it doesn’t automatically show up in\n  Preview’s list of Quartz filters. Either ColorSync or Preview is\n  working from the wrong folder.\nColorSync saves your filters in your personal “Filters” folder under\n  your “Library”. But Preview looks in “PDF Services” for the filters.\n  Copy or move the new filter from your Library’s “Filters” folder to\n  your Library’s “PDF Services” folder. If you want to make the filter\n  available to everyone who uses your Mac, put it in the main\n  “/Library/PDF Services” folder instead. Note that Lion has hidden the\n  Library folder, so you’ll need to use the “Go” menu and “Go to\n  folder…” to go to your “Library” folder, and also to go to the\n  “/Library”, depending on whether you are making it available for\n  yourself or for everyone.\n\n\nA: Actually, the best way is to use this website.\nSmallpdf, it is far more easier and better than other ways.\n", "Q: TextMate 2: How to enable/disable Code Folding Text files shown in TextMate 2 are not currently showing me any options for Code Folding.

I have an iPad 4th Gen that I could not have used for a few weeks already.  The iCloud overlay that says \"you have not backed up for 35 weeks...\" is covering up the whole screen, and the \"OK\" button is not responding at all.\nIf I press and hold the power button on the iPad for 5 seconds, the screen will show the \"Slide and power off\" widget, but the iCloud overlay is covering up the screen (transparently), and I cannot slide that power off widget at all to power off.\nI think it was due to some race condition of the notifications / iCloud so that there is some error that prevents the iCloud overlay from closing and so I cannot do anything to the iPad.\nIt has been at least 8 weeks I can't use this iPad.  It was about 70% charged several weeks ago, and now it is down to 30%.  I set the screen to turn off automatically really quickly, so it is using power very slowly.  I was hoping to let the battery drain so that it will force itself to power down.  But there is still 30% and that means 4 more weeks or so.  I even tried to wrap the whole iPad around plastic bag first and then wrap aluminum foil around the whole thing, because in physics, it is said that the electromagnetic wave will not be able to pass through this way, and I was hoping to drain the iPad off power due to it trying hard to connect to WiFi.  But I did it for 24 hours already, and the power stayed at 30%.\nOne way might also be to put the iPad in the refrigerator, because I noticed that if it is an iPhone, during skiing, it became so cold that the battery dropped from 50% and to 20% and to power off in a few hours.  But I also don't want to damage the iPad if it is in really low temperature and the other reason is that it seems really stupid to power off the iPad by putting it into the fridge.\nIs there a way to solve this?\n\nA: you can hold down the power and home button for a couple of seconds to force reboot it!\nas simple as that, don't put it in the fridge and risk condensation corrosion of the circuits!\n", "Q: Macbook air mid-2011 visual glitch problem I face some problems with my macbook air mid 2011 (HD 3000), some weird visual glitch on the screen (see pictures).\nIs there any solution or fix?

I am not really sure how to understand the green dots though.\nWhat this means is that the drive is bursting out the initial write and read speeds, then progressively decaying (Most likely a cache problem, but i'm not so versed on those matters) towards a crawl. This fact correlates with my setup experience from a Mavericks install usb drive: The installation went off smoothly at first but the speed decayed to a crawl on the last stages, almost to a full stop.\nI will have this MBP's drive replaced and report back on my findings.\n\nAftermath\nThe new disc somewhat helped for a couple hours but the problem came back. The guys at the mac center support said they replaced the data bus, now the MBP works wonders\n\nA: I agree with @bmike. You really need to run these tests under OS X. however, on the surface it looks like hardware, and i can recommend, based on my own experience with a 2010 MBP with a Core 2 Duo that replacing the stock Hard Drive (which is a paltry 5400 RPM Dog) with a VERY cost effective Seagate Momentus Hybrid Drive will breathe new life into your Mac. It makes an incredible difference. \n\nA: For those who still have this problem, this is the solution:\n1 - Start the mac holding 'option';\n2 - Choose the recovery boot disc;\n3 - Select Disc Utility option;\n4 - Select the disc where os x is installed;\n5 - Click 'Fix disc permissions' button;\n6 - Wait till it's done;\n7 - Restart you mac in normal mode;\n8 - Problem solved (At least for me and the guy that told me to do this).\n\nA: Just to give a correct interpretation of the SMART Data and the benchmark and clear up the misunderstandings revealed in some answers, comments and the question:\nThe SMART Data shows a normal degradation of an approx. three years old hard disk.\nThe benchmark shows the normal behavior of a spinning hard drive.\nUsually the linear density of magnetic areas holding a bit is almost constant on the whole platter. Therefore the outermost track contains more bits than the innermost track. With one rotation of the platter the read/write head can read/write more bits on the outermost track than the innermost track in the same time.\nExample:\nRotations: 1/second\nBit-density: 100 Bits/inch  \nRadius of the outermost track: 2 inches -> track length: 12,6 inches\nRadius of the innermost track: 1 inch   -> track length:  6,3 inches  \nBits on the outermost track: 1260 B\nBits on the innermost track:  630 B  \nRead/write rate outermost track: 1260 B/s\nRead/write rate innermost track:  630 B/s\nAs a result the read rate (blue) and the write rate (pink) slightly decreases from the outermost tracks on the left (≈ 84 MB/s) to the innermost tracks on the right (≈ 45 MB/s).\nThe average access time (the time it takes before the drive can actually transfer data from a random track.) is also normal (≈ 17 ms).

Sounds maybe strange but this sometime also is the reason why a macbook is slow.\n", "Q: Workspaces not switching automatically Despite the fact that I have told mission control under 10.8 to spaces when switching applications(to the key window), it does not appear to work.  In fact the only time spaces works is when I tell it to switch using keyboard shortcuts. This started happening only once I unchecked show dashboard as space.\nThe following symptoms also occur:\n-Checking \"show dashboard as space\" does not re-enable dashboard\n-Dragging windows to the side of the screen does not cause spaces to switch\n-Keyboard shortcuts for mission control do not invoke mission control.\nMac OS 10.8\n\nA: I was also having this problem on mavericks (osx 10.9.5).

My suspicion is that somehow the spaces plist files get corrupted.\nMy problem was fixed by regenerating the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spaces.plist file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to your user's Library folder.  This folder is hidden by default, but you can get there by holding down the option key when you click the Go menu in Finder and selecting Library.\n\n*Open the Preferences folder.\n\n*Move com.apple.spaces.plist to the desktop.  There might be more than one, so drag them all out.\n\n*Log out and log back in.\n\n\nA: I've seen this intermittently for a few releases now. I fix it by restarting the \"Dock\" process (which handles Spaces/MissionControl) using this Terminal command:\nkillall Dock\nI don't know how to do that via the regular GUI, sorry. And before you run that command, do killall -s Dock to see the processes which will get killed. If only the one \"Dock\" process is listed then you're good to go.

I have a song in my iTunes (11) library that loops amazingly well, but is rather short in duration.  I'd like to double the length of the song by having it loop once before continuing, so that I can use the extended version in randomly-shuffled playlists.\nI know I can extend a song's length by including the same song in a playlist twice in a row, burning the list to a CD, and then merging the songs when I import back (with a gap of 0).  However, this requires throwing away a lot of CDs if I encounter many such songs.\nIs there an all-digital way to merge two songs together?\n\nA: Well you can use any digital audio editor to combine songs.

Or should I not drag-and-drop images, but go through the hassle of importing?\n\nA: This would be due to the difference in resolution.\nYou will likely need to adjust the size/resolution of your images (can use preview for this).\nRefer to the following discussions: \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4472984\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/11208784#11208784 \n", "Q: Bug with the automator action \"rotate an image\" and tags I have the following bug.\nI have created a small app that rotates an image, with the help of automator.\n\nBut when I apply this action to a file with tags, it removes all the tags of the file (by tag, I me am the Finder's tags, introduced in Mavericks).\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you reproduce that bug?\n\n*Waiting for the bug to be removed, how can I do to keep tags when rotating (with automator)?\n\nA: Yes the Tags do get wiped on mine.\nAs an example of resetting them.

The question arises, which OS version is the one that gets the best performance out of my system.\nIt is a 24' iMac with a 2.93GHz Core 2 Duo processor and 4 GB of RAM.\nWhich OS between Snow Leopard and Mavericks will be the smoothest on my system? Has there been some comparison of the performance with different OSs?\n\nA: I would suggest to use Mac OS X 10.6.\nFor my iMac 24\" I have tested all newer versions (on different volumes), and 10.6 is running as it should be. 10.9 seems to be okay, but sometimes I see the \"ball\" and it takes more time until I can go on...\nBut it depends what you want to do and what you like - newer systems offers new features (and for me this is exactly why I stay on 10.6).

If you go to 10.7 or above, I suggest reading this article about upgrading )https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-6271).

It runs Mavericks smoothly. \nConsider two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A lot of software will not run on Snow Leopard. Make sure everything you need is still available for 10.6\n\n*Apple has no official support schedule, but support for 10.6 will certainly phase out soon and that means you will no longer receive security updates (which is important if your Mac is connected to the internet) \nUpdate: There are signs that support has already been dropped for Snow Leopard. via Computerworld\n(BTW: If you feel your iMac is too slow, consider replacing the disk with a cheap SSD.

I'd like all apps that are capable of running full-screen to launch in full-screen mode automatically, instead of me having to press Ctrl-Cmd-F each time, is that possible?\n\nA: I realized the answer to this question well long after I had the problem. I kept trying to use several work arounds until I realized that feature hadn't been removed, but rather rolled into a different set of features.\nMost full-screen apps don't remain open because it's a type of window state. By default, under General, the setting \"Close windows when quitting an app\" is turned on, which means the window you have saved will be closed and return to it's default state.\nTo retain full-screen, or your previous window preferences, you need to turn off this setting!\n\n\nA: I called Mac support about the issue, and it seems in Yosemite this feature has been since removed in general. However there are some apps that still function this way. One of them being iTunes (which opens in full screen mode).\nIt was suggested, to get the functionality of a full screen app, after quitting, is to assign an app to a new desktop, and maximize it (press the option key + clicking on green).

The disk will eventually be formatted on the 2nd or 3rd try.\n\nA: Following up on the comments; you can boot from a Linux-based bootdisk and try to format the disk in FAT32, EXT3 (or 4) or HFS(+). HFS needs you to first load kernel extensions tho, which might be a hassle. FAT32 will suffice as the OSX installation tool will force HFS+ Journaled again anyway :)\n", "Q: How can I use Google Calendar etc. with iCloud? Since 3 years, I'm a Linux user.

But as I travel often and of course also work on the road I also need to have a mobile backup solution. I thought about the following: \nOne partition of my external hard drive has the same size like my internal hard drive (e.g. 500GB). I use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone my internal hard drive daily. The second partition of my external hard drive backups all changes starting from last cloning on; only if manually activated when I leave home for a longer time.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: In Mountain Lion and greater, you can create multiple separate backup disks with Time Machine. Get an USB external HD for traveling, and use that to backup your Mac whilst on the road. When at home, you can do a backup to another HD, (USB or otherwise,) which stays there permanently. I take this external HD when I travel. It is wicked fast, and demonstrably rugged, as I have dropped it several times with no ill effects. You can also use this disk to make a CCC clone, if that is your preferred backup method.\nNote: It is not a wise idea to have a backup partition, (CCC, TM or otherwise,) on the same drive you're backing up. If the HD itself goes poof, you've lost the backups you need to restore your system. \n", "Q: Sent email disappeared, heard 'sent' whoosh, but it's not in the Sent file Wrote email, sent it off, heard whoosh sound, assumed it was done. \nNot so.\nCannot find the email anywhere, least of all where it should be: in the Sent File.\nTried various setting options - advanced to tick off the 'sent' option on iPad (nothing) and cannot get it to go to the web server where it was in the first place, but then somehow switched.\nI just want to see what I sent, that's all.

I've had this happen with cellular on my iPhone when connections were spotty. On several cases the device clearly THOUGHT it had sent the message, and the draft was successfully deleted, but nothing was ever sent. I don't recall having this occur on my iOS device after updating to latest iOS7 though.\n\nA: For what it's worth, I just wrote an enormous email to someone that I spent two days writing. It was safely stored in GMails \"Drafts\" for days. I finally finished it on my iPad using Mail and sent it. That was the last I saw of it- no Outbox- no record of it whatsoever. Gone.

However, everything on Mail appears to be synced with GMail. I have searched GMail's web interface. It's just gone. I can hardly accept it.\nI don't use Mail much because of stuff like this. I guess I have to have an infuriating experience like this to remind me why I use other mail tools and why I put up with them even though Apple doesn't support email sending from any other app but Mail.\nSo suffice it to say, I feel your pain.

Now both show me an established connection, and I have installed an SSH demon on the Linux machine. So far everything is fine. But when I try to ssh from the Mac into the Linux, I get a timeout almost every time. Occasionally it works, usually with the WiFi made inactive.

So if you have manually set IP addresses and such then take all that out.\nOpen System Preferences > Sharing and select Internet Sharing. Then in the drop down \"Share your connection from: \" choose \"Wi-Fi\" and in the box tick \"Ethernet\".\nThis should fix your problem but it might require rebooting the Linux box.\n", "Q: How to find low bitrate audio (non alac/flac) I'm relatively new to the audiophile world and I still have some lossy audio files in my music folder. I do have all this music on cd so I would like to find the lossy albums so that I can rerip these, but this time in alac. How can I do this?\nA smart folder works, but shows each track individually so that identifying each album still takes up quite a bit of time. I've tried a couple of disk usage tools, but none of them were capable of filtering by filetype or even better by audio bitrate.\nIs there software out there that can do this? An iTunes script perhaps? Any help with sieving through a 300gB collection will be much appreciated. \n\nA: In iTunes, go to the menu View -> View Options.\nExpand the File triangle, and check “Kind”\nYou can now sort your songs by file type by clicking on that column header, and they cluster by album.\nAlternately, make a smart playlist that includes files by their kind or size, and use the View dropdown in the top right to view it by Artist List (or Grid, but I assume you have your music collection sorted by artist.)\n\nA: You might also use mdfind:\nmdfind -onlyin ~/Music 'kMDItemAudioBitRate<=192000'\nmdfind -onlyin ~/Music 'kMDItemContentType=public.mp3||(kMDItemContentType=com.apple.m4a-audio&&kMDItemAudioBitRate<5e5)'\nmdfind -0 -onlyin ~/Music 'kMDItemFSName=*.mp3&&kMDItemAudioBitRate<=192000'|xargs -0 mdls -n kMDItemAlbum|cut -d\\\" -f2|awk '!a[$0]++'\n\nA: I'd create a regular playlist, \"purchased online with no CD\", and add all the stuff you've purchased from the iTunes store or Amazon where you don't have physical media.\nOnce you've done that, create a smart playlist and set it to require Kind does not contain \"Apple Lossless\" and playlist is not \"purchased online with no CD\". Then sort it by album and you'll know which ones to re-rip without it nagging you about the stuff you don't have CDs for.\n", "Q: Copy from `OS X` and paste using `OS X Screen Sharing` to a Raspberry Pi I have a Raspberry Pi which I access from my Mac using ssh and VNC (tightvncserver).\nI am using OS X Screen Sharing\nI want to be able to copy from OS X and paste into a GUI app on the Pi.\n(Copying using ssh works as normal).\nShare the contents of the Clipboard with another Mac mentions using Edit >Use Shared Clipboard, but this option is greyed out when sharing the Pi.\nIs there any way to paste into the Pi GUI? \n\nA: The first thing to try would be installing autocutsel on the Pi. \nYou can find details at Raspberry Pi StackExchange.\nOnce you have that installed try both turning on shared clipboard and sending the clipboard from the Mac.\nIf that doesn't work then try a VNC client app such as Chicken.\n\nA: When working on python scripts my work-around is to open a terminal session on the mac and SSH in to the Pi at the same time as the screen sharing session. I do the copy pasting in the terminal session (running nano editor) and everything else in the screen sharing session. Not an elegant solution.\n\nA: The suggested answer did not work, but is no longer an issue.\nI use the RealVNC server now included in Raspberry Pi OS and installed the VNC Viewer which allows Copy/Paste.\n", "Q: Stream iPhone camera video to a Mac Is there an app that would let me stream the iPhone/iPad camera to my Mac?

I have looked at this question, and apparently my iMac does support mixing memory sizes. However, when I installed 2 4GB memory modules and 2 2GB memory modules, when I clicked  → About This Mac → More Info... → Memory, it said that I had only installed 4 2GB modules. I have checked the packaging, and it still verifies that they are both 4GB modules. For further information, I am running Version 10.9.1 Mavericks.\n\nA: If you use only the 4GB modules, what does it say then?\nIf it still see's them as 2GB each, it might be the RAM - who knows, maybe they just put the wrong sticker on it ;)\n", "Q: iPad Air aluminum scuffed badly. Should I worry about it? My 2 year old son managed to scuff the back of my iPad Air by pushing it on its back across a ceramic tile floor.  The worst of it is near the top by the mic.  Are these scratches merely cosmetic, or do I need to worry about the aluminum oxidizing?\n\n\nA: I wouldn't worry - looks like you got off without a scratched lens cover and only light cosmetic damage.\nIn general, Aluminum oxidation is a good thing as it seals the metal and protects. However, despite not being able to pin down the exact alloy that Apple uses, I know from experience that the iPad cases are not prone to oxidation even when deeply scratched or gouged.\nI have never seen an iPad with structural or even cosmetic issues due to corrosion due to the anodized coating being scuffed. I have seen many iPads used in a marine environment and saltwater spray and/or the highly saturated air usually kills the circuitry inside far before the case can wear or corrode.\nI'd say, clean up any sharp scrapes or cover them with a case and don't worry about the effects of the scratches.\n", "Q: If you add a USB WiFi adapter can you network share it over WiFi? I've connected to a wired network before and shared that over WiFi. I'm curious if I got a USB WiFi adapter if I could do the same thing with WiFi input. So the USB WiFi adapter would be the network / internet input, and the built in WiFi adapter would be the output.\n\nA: Yes.  You can share any network device to any other network device using the Internet Sharing settings in System Preferences.\n\nA: I don't think so because the USB Wifi adapter won't have \"Wifi-Options\" in the Internet Sharing preference panel.. \n\nA: If you connect to the wifi on the USB adapter and then go to the Sharing preferences pane, and enable Internet sharing using the USB adapter as the source it should work. However depending on the adapter it might not show up in Internet sharing as a source, so YMMV.\nBe careful that you have permission to do this as it can be seen (at least in the U.S.) as pirating a wireless signal or some other unauthorized use.\n", "Q: Change keyboard whenever iTerm is selected Using either Applescript or Automator is it possible to switch the software keyboard(Input Source) to a certain keyboard(input source) whenever iTerm becomes foreground?\nScenario is as follows\n\n\n*\n\n*I click on iTerm window\n\n*iTerm window goes foreground\n\n*A script changes the keyboard(input source) to one that I specify\n\n\nA: You could for example save this plist as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/itermchangeinput.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>itermchangeinput</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>osascript</string>\n    <string>-e</string>\n    <string>set prev to missing value\nrepeat\n    set cur to name of application (path to frontmost application as text)\n    if cur is \"iTerm\" and prev is not \"iTerm\" then do shell script \"changeInput U.S.\"\n    delay 1\n    set prev to cur\nend repeat</string>\n  </array>\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n  <key>KeepAlive</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThen run launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/itermchangeinput.plist.\nYou could also use a shell script like this:\nwhile sleep 1;do cur=$(lsappinfo find ASN=$(lsappinfo front)|cut -d\\\" -f2);[[ $cur = iTerm && $prev != iTerm ]]&&changeInput U.S.;prev=$cur;done\nIt might be less efficient though because it executes two new processes every second.\nThe original blog post about changeInput was deleted by the author, but I uploaded the binary to http://19a5b0.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/changeInput.tgz.\nIf you always switch to iTerm with a keyboard shortcut (like F7), you could use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <vkopenurldef>\n    <name>KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_ITERM</name>\n    <url>file:///Applications/iTerm.app</url>\n  </vkopenurldef>\n  <inputsourcedef>\n    <name>US</name>\n    <inputsourceid_prefix>com.apple.keylayout.US</inputsourceid_prefix>\n  </inputsourcedef>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F7, ModifierFlag::NONE, VK_OPEN_URL_ITERM, VK_CHANGE_INPUTMODE_US</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nYou can see the IDs of input sources with EventViewer (/Applications/KeyRemap4MacBook.app/Contents/Applications/EventViewer.app/).\n", "Q: Boot Camp will not allow removing Windows 8 partition I've used Boot Camp to install Windows 8 on my Air some time ago and I was trying to remove the windows partition to restore some space.

BootCamp got me hard headaches some times.\nThe fastest way would be to make a backup of your Macintosh HD (create a disk image) and partition the whole drive. Delete all partitions, apply, then create a new one and apply. Be sure to set the partition type to GUID.\n\nA: Start up from an install disk or recovery partition, use Disk Utility or Terminal to kill the Windows partitions, instead of trying through Boot Camp. Then resize your main HD to reclaim the existing space.\nIf you are comfortable with it, might be best to stick with Terminal, specifically using diskutil and paying attention to the eraseVolume and resizeVolume commands. Stick with resizeVolume Macintosh\\ HD R to automatically increase the volume size to the available limits of free space.

I'm confused about data usage / hotspot while connected to WiFi.\nI'm asking because my Windows 8 laptop cannot recognize my friend's router, as in it can't even find it, however, my iPhone 4 can. I have connected using my iPhone 4 and turned on the \"Personal Hotspot\" feature.\nDoes this use my Data Allowance from Telstra, or will all internet/network traffic flow through to the router?\nIf the above answer is yes, what if I took out my SIM Card? Would it not work at all, or flow through to the router?\n\nA: You cannot use your Wi-Fi connection for Internet connectivity while other devices are using Wi-Fi for Personal Hotspot. You can share only a cellular data connection; you cannot share a Wi-Fi connection.\nAs seen here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4517\n\nA: Yes it does use your data. Even though it says you're connected to wifi the hot spot overrides it & uses your cellular data. I finally figured this out after months of questioning my cellular company as to how it was possible I could use that much data. My son puts it on in the car for his iPad & then when we get out & go inside our home my phone connects to wifi but his iPad still leeches my hot spot from my phone.  Of course Rogers couldn't figure that out or at least they didn't want to tell me. It was only after going 4GB over my 10Gb plan & having them cut my data off completely that I was able to figure out what was going on & then called them to confirm.

I just want to mark every item in my Reading List as read. All 200+ of them. Is there a CLI solution, or a way to edit the ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist file to mark them as  read?\n\nA: The XML tag that determines whether the article has been read is DateLastViewed.\nI think the simplest, most user friendly way to do it (for most people, anyway) is with TextEdit find-and-replace.\nFirst, though, you're going to have to convert the plist file from binary to XML with this command (Enter it at the prompt in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app): plutil -convert xml1 'Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist'; open 'Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist' -a TextEdit Don't worry if it gives you an error; that just means it has already been converted.\nThe command will also open up the newly converted file in TextEdit.\nFind-and-replace \n\n<key>DateAdded</key>\n with \n<key>DateLastFetched</key><date>2012-10-13T12:15:04Z</date><key>DateLastViewed</key><date>2012-10-13T12:15:04Z</date><key>DateAdded</key>\n\nWhat this does is puts the DateLastViewed (and DateLastFetched, just to be safe) before every time it finds a DateAdded.

I use my iPad as PDF reader, so my iPad contains many PDFs which I'd like to sync.\nIt should be the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to login with correct Apple ID on every device you want to sync\n\n*Plug in iPad/iPhone to your Mac (my situation)\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*In iTunes go to File → Devices → Transfer purchases from <iOS device>.\n\n\nBut iTunes copy all my apps, not only books or PDFs.\n\nA: In Yosemite, this is now possible using only iBooks. On your iOS device (in my case an iPad 3rd Gen running iOS8), enable 'sync collections' in the settings for iBooks (within the iOS Settings app).\nOn your Mac, create a collection and add a PDF to it. It should then appear on your iDevice.\n\nA: Preview, Apple's default PDF viewer, works with iCloud, but for some strange reason it can only be synced or viewed on other Macs, not iOS devices or web browsers. According to Apple Support, you can drag and drop PDFs into your iBooks Library on Mavericks. Then, click the \"Books\" tab in the iBooks app on your iPad, click the \"Sync\" button, and if you've set up your iBooks sync to sync only selected books/PDFs, check the boxes next to the PDFs you want synced to your device. And that should be all.\nThis fall Apple is releasing iCloud Drive to both iMacs and iOS devices, so it will not only be able sync your PDFs to your iOS devices for later viewing, but also any other kind of file you want to sync.

What was really odd was the cursor moved fine but none of the clicking worked (either the tap or the actual click on the trackpad).  Also what appeared really odd was placing the cursor over any of the window icons in the top left (the close, maximise, minimise) buttons didn't show the X, +, - glyphs as it usually does.\nI rebooted the OS multiple times (I think 5) until it actually worked again.\nThis makes no sense to me at all.

I believe it has little to do with the amount of free space on your iOS device, but instead iTunes is ambiguously informing you concerning the amount of free space on your computer's hard drive. Though the support article I link is concerning backups failing to restore through iTunes, it does describe the issue. \nWhat is happening is iTunes has determined there is not enough free space on your hard drive to backup the iOS device once that file syncs over. The reason for this is that by default, iOS device backups include all apps and all documents those apps store (including your large mkv file), which is why when you sync, the longest process is usually the first one, the notorious backup process, which occurs at every sync. \n\n\nSolutions\n\ndisable full iTunes backups\nChanging the behavior of iTunes backups to ignore the documents stored on your iOS device is one solution to your issue.\nto disable full iTunes backups on OS X, enter this command in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app :\n defaults write com.apple.iTunes DeviceBackupsDisabled -bool true\n\nto reenable the full iTunes backups switch to false:\n defaults write com.apple.iTunes DeviceBackupsDisabled -bool false\n\nFor disabling full iTunes backups in Windows, please see these instructions.\n\nfree up space on your hard drive\ndelete iTunes backups\nOne easy way is to delete the old iTunes backups you're storing. See the \"Deleting a backup in iTunes\" section of the Apple support article linked here, which I will quote below:\n\nIf you want to delete a backup created by iTunes, follow these steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open iTunes Preferences:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Windows : Choose Edit > Preferences\n  \n*Mac: Choose iTunes > Preferences\n  \n  \n*Click Devices (the iOS device doesn't need to be connected).\n  \n*iTunes will show the phone number, IMEI, and serial number of the backed up iPhone when you position your mouse pointer over a backup (iTunes shows only the serial number for iPad and iPod touch). You can use this to find the backup you want to delete.\n  \n*Select the backup you want to remove and click Delete Backup.\n  \n\n\n\n\n5 Quick Tips to Free Up Disk Space in Mac OS X\nSee the article linked in this subheading for easy ways to clear space on your hard drive if you have a Mac. For clearing up free space on Windows, try this guide.\n\nMonolingual\nAnother reasonably painless way to free up hard drive space is to use an open source utility like Monolingual to remove unnecessary language resources from OS X, which by itself can free up hundreds of MB.\n\n\n\nOther recommendations\nYou can view your video in the iOS native media player without transcoding\nSubler is a utility designed specifically for adding subtitles to video files. It will also, however, simply copy and rewrap, and not transcode, the AVC (h.264) encoded video wrapped in mkv to a friendly format, and it will transcode the audio from ACC to AAC if necessary. Further, it will also optimize the location of the mpeg-4 atom in the resulting file for iTunes friendly use. It uses a friendly drag and drop paradigm. Download Subler, unzip into your Applications folder and launch Subler. Type command-n to begin, and drag your mkv file into the window, and choose from the simple available options to convert your mkv file without transcoding. Then import your new mp4 file into iTunes and sync to your iOS device.\nFor Windows systems, MkvToMp4 is an application that similarly will reformat your mkv to mp4 without transcoding. Whether the resulting mp4 file will be friendly to iTunes remains to be seen, but it is worth a try to be able to losslessly convert video files from one format to another.\nAlternatively, this bash script uses ffmpeg, SublerCLI and HandbrakeCLI to batch rewrap, transcode or otherwise convert video files of various codecies and iTunes/iOS incompatible wrappers to iTunes/iOS friendly formats, automatically choosing a method that retains the best possible quality resultant file. It, however, takes bit of reading and understanding the script to get it to install its dependencies. Also it will take a lot of time to complete processing if set upon a lot of files requiring HandBrake transcodes, and while doing so eventually eat up all your free memory in the process. It is very covenient once it is working and set in your $PATH, will eat through directory structures converting unfriendly video formats where it finds them, and nondestructively will place original files in your ~/.Trash so you can preview the resultant files before eliminating the originals.\nTechnically, you can use bash scripts on Windows if you first install Cygwin. The script linked above would likely need some adjusting to work under Cygwin, but if learning a little bash doesn't kill you, then it will only make you stronger. ;-)\n\nA: I encountered this issue when trying to sync a video to the VLC app on iOS, using iTunes File Sharing under Apps in the Mobile Device view. The fix that worked for me was to unmark all categories of synced files (Music, Videos, Photos...), sync the device, and then attempt to transfer the video again. It then worked. I did not found that computer disk space had anything immediate to do with the issue as I have plenty of free space on my main drive (~6x the storage of my iPad) (Using OS X El Capitan with iTunes 12.5.1. in 2016).\n", "Q: Special character codes are displayed in the Terminal for diacritics when connecting to an Ubuntu Server When I connect to an Ubuntu Server (ssh) and I try to see some text in the Terminal form the remote server, I get character codes instead of the appropriate text with diacritics.\nfor example for a git log on the server I get:\nAuthor: Ionic<C4><83> Biz<C4><83>u <bizauionica@...>\n\ninstead of:\nAuthor: Ionică Bizău <bizauionica@...>\n\nWhen I do git log on my local machine in the Terminal, I get the correct diacritics.\nI have no idea in which category this issue falls:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal\n\n*bash\n\n*ssh\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*git\n\n\nI initially asked Ubuntu for this issue but they redirected me here.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The LC_ALL variable having an empty value was causing the problem.\nSo the solution of this problem can be found on SO here:\nOn mac, the LC_ALL variable is not set by default.

Like ll/a versus zp/e – for different countries.\nI want buy a new iPad Air and I stock between different part numbers.\n\nA: The difference is localization. For iPad Air, it only means that you will get translated documentation. So it's OK to get it from another country like the Philippines.\nWarranty is worldwide. The software language you will choose on first use, and you can change it later.\nThe only real difference is for products with keyboards (iMac, MacBook, etc), obviously then it will influence your keyboard layout (QWERTY, AZERTY etc.).\n\nA: Yes those are Model Regions, You can check the numbers here\nAs the site states: It is not possible to see to what carrier the phone is locked (or not) by just looking at the model number, but it gives you an idea where the phone was intended to be sold.\nSummarized for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*ZP = Hong Kong, Macau and\n\n*LL= USA\n\n", "Q: Migrating parallels PVM from Mac to Windows I have a Linux image (Parallels v9 PVM file) on my MBP, which I would like to migrate to Windows (to clarify: so that the Linux image can be launched from Windows, instead of from Mac).\nIs this possible?  Do I just need to install Parallels on the Windows PC and copy over the .PVM?  Or do I need to use a different tool for the migration?\n\nA: To launch the PVM under Windows you need Parallels Workstation running on your Windows box. Unfortunately Parallels withdrew that product either later 2013 or early 2014 which is a shame.\nI run the Windows product all the time with multiple VMs running (Windows desktop with lots of disk space) and then move the PVM to my MacBook Air (limited disk space)when I have to go to a customer site\n", "Q: Configure Airport to routers DMZ IP I have a router connected to the Internet. I have connected my Airport Extreme to this router. I know this is receiving the message (Double NAT).\nSince I want to receive all traffic on my Airport, I want to connect to the router's DMZ.\nIn which field do I enter the routers DMZ on my Airport Utility?\n\nA: Apple uses the wording \"Default Host\" for a DMZ. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open AirPort Utility\n\n*Select the AirPort \n\n*Click Edit \n\n*Click the Network tab \n\n*Network Options\n\n*Click \"Enable default host at\"\n\n*enter the local IP you wish to use and done.\n\n\nI hope you have the same version and same options visible as I do...\n\nA: As Rob says, \"Default Host\" is what you are looking for.  The current version (as of June 2015) of the Airport Utilty App (iOS) uses the following path:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Airport Utility\n\n*Select the Airport\n\n*Click 'Edit'\n\n*Click 'Advanced'\n\n*Click 'DHCP and NAT'\n\n*Click 'Default Host', and enter the IP address you want.\n\n\nAnd the Airport Utility App (Mac) uses this path:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Airport Utility\n\n*Select the Airport\n\n*Click 'Edit'\n\n*Click 'Network'\n\n*Click 'Network Options'\n\n*Click 'Default Host', and enter the IP address you want.\n\n\nSeparately, you would probably also go into 'Reservations' on the DHCP and NAT page so that you can map one certain device's MAC address to the IP you just set.\nFor example, to get XBoxLive to play nice, find the MAC address for your XBox (from the XBox menus), then set a reservation from that MAC address to a specific IP address that you choose, then set the 'Default Host' to that same IP.  That will put your XBox on the DMZ.\n", "Q: Is It Possible to Install OS X on an External Drive for Use with Any Mac? My dad would like to encourage me to learn how to program in C++, but he doesn't want anything that could possibly go wrong with any of the computers that we own while I am doing so to affect any of the data associated with their other user accounts.  As such, he would like to give me an external drive for me to use as an isolated programming environment.  This would be relatively straightforward to set up, but I was wondering if I could install OS X on this drive in such a way that I could boot it no matter which one of my family's computers it was hooked up to so that I could use whichever one is available as they become so.  Is it possible to do this at least for a late 2007 aluminum iMac and a 15-inch MacBook Pro that my dad bought late in the summer of 2011?  \n\nA: Yes it is quite easy.\nFor example, my MAC had a bottle of Champagne poured on it (long story, short) and I removed the hard drive and placed it in another machine. I also later took that drive and placed in an external enclosure and booted from it by using the \"OPTION\" key when booting. This brings up a list of all accessible drives INCLUDING NETWORKED DRIVES if accessible.  So you could configure your DEVELOPMENT drive on your network and boot from it HOWEVER unless you have GIGABIT network it would be slow. \nSo to create an external bootable self contained OSX drive I recommend the following tutorial, BE ADVISED it will clear off any data on the external drive and your doing all of this at your own risk.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht5911\n\nA: In general, no. Apple maintains a list of minimum builds that guarantee for a specific hardware model, the drivers have been included to make everything work. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1159\nYour inevitable choice of build version to install on the USB drive will mean that some computers will be too old (don't meet minimum requirements for your build) and some too new (your OS is too old for them). \nIn limited cases (and even in wide ranges of computers spanning 4 years) one build can work for a whole host of computers. Also, the OS can work well enough in many cases if you are missing a WiFi driver or something minor and can run updates to get the required additions when you take an older OS onto \"unsupported\" newer hardware. \nYou can have much success with an external drive and multiple computers - especially once you check the build details and requirements for the OS and computers you intend to use. I say go for it, even though there isn't a universal, all encompassing image for all hardware shipped. \nSo, setting aside the new Mac Pro - I would expect every Mac manufactured in the last 5 years to run any 10.9.1 installed from a current 2012/2013 install. From a practical standpoint, I would run the install from the newest Mac you have which is the 2011 model to get the most recent version of things and to download the installer from the App Store and not reuse an old saved one in case Apple has rolled new drivers into the current installer. \n\nA: It did not work for me. What I found is that when you install OS X or download OS X from the AppStore, you do not get the same binaries for all Macs. For example, if you get OS X for a 2007 Mac, it will not work on a 2008 Mac. I have a Late-2011 Macbook Pro (not Retina) and installer for it does not run on a Early-2012 Macbook Pro (non-Retina). Different hardware needs different drivers and when installing, the Installer puts a right combination for your current Mac.\nIt is possible that you will have compatible hardware but it will be much safer (and faster!) to use a NAS for your work and boot Macs normally.\n\nA: Yes that is possible.\nI have a 2012 iMac and a 2012 MBP and have an external thunderbolt drive that has Mountain Lion on it installed from the iMac.\nIt boots up flawlessly on both the MBP and the iMac.\nI use it mainly for those apps that are not supported by Mavericks yet and as an emergency backup for when I'm travelling.\n", "Q: Blue color lines on display I recently updated to Mavericks OS of my MacBook Pro 13\" inch which was bought on October 2012.

I have the flashing finder icon problem. When I boot from DVD, I cannot choose the disk as Startup Disk. However, it appears in Disk Utility. When I run Repair Disk I can see the disk, and that it has about 130GB used, but Repair Disk takes literally about four seconds -- a suspiciously short amount of time. By contrast, Repair Disk on the external takes about three minutes.\nWhat is the best explanation for this?\n\nA: Checking a disk checks the partition map but not the volume data structures.\nChecking a volume checks the partition itself, which can take much longer.\n", "Q: Reinstall Mac OSX on Ubuntu Macbook Last year I installed Ubuntu on my 2006 MacBook (Intel), and erased the hard drive with MacOSX 10.5 in the process.

How to fix this? In OS X Mavericks, com.apple.IconServices seems to be causing almost 100% CPU usage and is causing Finder to become unresponsive (the \"beach ball\"). This happens periodically, usually when accessing a directory in Finder for the first time in a while. Restarting Finder stops IconServices from eating all the CPU, but revisiting the problem directory makes the problem happen again. How do I solve this?\n\nA: Apple user Kieran Healy has apparently solved the root problem and come up with a fix, described on his blog here. The short of it is to open Terminal and then enter the following command:\nmkdir ${TMPDIR}/com.apple.IconServices\n\nApparently, IconServices was seeking a directory and, failing to find it, began thrashing. Kieran's fix creates that directory. \nWhen I tried this solution, the fix was immediate -- that is, no restarting, relaunching, or even re-visiting of directories was required. \nAll credit goes to Kieran Healy for this fix. I suggest visiting his website and giving him a \"like\".\n\nA: This blog post shows how to find out exactly what IconServicesAgent and coreservicesd are up to when they're thrashing your Finder.\nIn a nutshell, grep the output of fs_usage to find out what files are being icon-serviced all the time.  Specific command lines are given, and the files that were causing their problems are the same ones I'm seeing.\nThe fs_usage invocation is a valuable diagnostic tool, especially if your problem isn't quite the same.\nIf this works for people, please pass the message on to this related question.  I don't have the reputation to answer it myself.\n\nA: I struggled with IconServiceAgent hitting 100% CPU and beyond - in particular when accessing folders managed by Google Drive.\nThese steps helped me on MacOS Mojave\n1: Remove the main store:\nsudo rm -rfv /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store\n\n2: Remove subsidiary data\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ \\( -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -or -name com.apple.iconservices \\) -exec rm -rfv {} \\;\n\n3: Restart and let MacOS rebuild the icon cache.

Basically, I would like to know if the root password as been changed on several machines. Can I have Apple Remote Desktop script this for me and automate this check?\n\nA: I found the info, but the data format is unnecessarily complex. At least in Mavericks (and I suspect several previous versions), it's in a property list, which is wrapped up inside another property list (the passwordpolicyoptions property in /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/root.plist). Theoretically, you should extract that property to a file, then use something like /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy to get the passwordLastSetTime property from it... but hacking it with sed is much easier:\ndscl . -read /Users/root PasswordPolicyOptions | sed -n '/passwordLastSetTime/{n;s@.*<date>\\(.*\\)</date>@\\1@p;}'\n\nThis command must be run as root; interactively you'd use sudo, but if you're running it with ARD, just use \"Send UNIX Command\", and set \"Run command as: User: root\".\n", "Q: Videos/Movies filling up my HDD Am a bit of an adrenaline junkie and have 2 GoPros that I use to create movies with in iMovie.\nAt the moment I can't seem to make any as my startup disk is full of 575 gb of Movie data, despite transferring all of the videos out of iPhoto and movies out of iTunes and iMovie and from various other locations.

Then from there it goes to the OS X trash. So you need to empty both of those trashes to reclaim the drive space.\nAlso, I use DaisyDisk to see where I have the most space being taken up. They have a free trial, but you will find it invaluable for freeing up drive space.\nSomething I use to move videos from iPhoto to external storage is the iPhoto Manager. It will copy the actual event from iPhoto do a different iPhoto library. In my case I have different libraries on different external drives. So I sync everything to the library on my internal drive. From there I can edit, share, etc. Then later I hook up the external drives and copy the events to the correct drives, then delete them from the internal library.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S loses GPS accuracy My iPhone 4S is 2 years old.

I started from new with my iPhone and now it is working fine.\n\nA: I would first suggest getting a new sim card from your carrier to rule out any issues on their end.\nIf this does not solve the issue, the Apple Store has an advanced hardware diagnostic utility which would easily diagnose such a problem.\n\nA: iPhone uses three types of location search (from best to worst):\n\n\n*\n\n*Satellite GPS signal\n\n*GSM positioning \n\n*Wi-fi networks around\n\n\nIt is possible that your GSM coverage is not very good or GSM base stations report location incorrectly or they report it in the way that the software does not interpret correctly.\nI have iPad 2, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S at home. iPad 2 has the worse accuracy. It always missed by 100m at least. Next comes iPhone 4, it is more or less correct but not exactly at the point. iPhone 4S has the best accuracy among all my devices: nearly always at the right place. So it can be an issue with hardware too.\n\nA: I experienced this same problem on the 19th, from morning until night.  It was mostly noticeable when using Maps for navigation; the arrow would go from blue to gray, I'd get frequent \"Locating\" messages, I'd get \"stuck\" for a mile or so until it would catch up.\nI left my 4S off all night, and now it's accurate and smooth again.  No resets of any configuration or data were performed.\nThe weather was clear yesterday; I think it shouldn't have affected GPS.  I didn't seem to be having any phone network problems (Virgin mobile 3G CDMA was working fine).  The problem persisted whether I was near Wi-Fi APs or not—a good deal of open country on my drive.\nBecause I can't observe enough in order to definitively answer the question, I must apologize that this isn't an answer per se, but if anyone does run into this again, try turning your phone off overnight, or perhaps even just waiting 24 hours.\n\nA: Other solutions can fix \"iPhone GPS not working\" problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset Network Settings (Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings)\n\n*Reset Location & Privacy (Settings > General > Reset > Reset Location & Privacy)\n\n*Ensure Location Services are ON (Settings > Privacy > Location Services > ON)\n\n*Restore from iTunes backup: restore your iPhone in iTunes with your iOS backup\n\n\nA: Go to: Settings > general > reset > location and privacy. \nClears all the stored location cache and app privacy settings ie \"allow this app to use location\" question will pop up again for every app. \nThis fixed my problem without having to restore my phone to a new one. \n", "Q: If my iPhone was stolen and I decide to cancel my phone plan, would it still show up on my iCloud?

So even if you cancel your phone plan after it's stolen, the iCloud linkage that was established when you setup your phone (or later modified it) would continue to remain with Apple.\nIf your iPhone is running iOS 7 and you have Find my iPhone turned on (Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Find my iPhone), then the person who has your phone cannot erase it or use it without your iCloud account and password.\nIf your iPhone is lost, you can visit http://www.icloud.com, login with your iCloud account (the one setup on your iPhone) and use Lost Mode (which prevents activation of the phone without your iCloud account credentials and also allows you to send a message to the device) or Erase iPhone (which erases your iPhone remotely).\nAlso see:\niOS 7: Activation Lock + Find My iPhone\nHow To Enable Activation Lock On Your iPhone And iPad (iOS Tips)\n\nA: No, depending.\nThey can't necessarily access your data and account if it's logged out on the phone.

Would it damage to put out cigarettes on the chassis of aluminum mac books?\n\nA: The short answer is 'yes,' it will damage the aluminum. The burning cigarette will accelerate the rate of oxidation. Maybe not one cigarette will make a noticeable mark, but given repeated exposure, you would see a difference. \n\nA: Depends on how soon after lighting you put it out. If you put it out before sticking it in your mouth and inhaling then overall there will be very little meaningful damage\n\nA: Yes, your cigarette will be irreparably damaged. You will have to replace it with a new one.\n\nA: I would say that the only damage caused by a cigarette to the aluminum itself would be cosmetic.\nClearly, the pebbled surface will trap nicotine and ash on the Aluminum. I suspect that Apple anodizes their unibody parts - and if so, that creates a hard, durable layer of aluminum oxide that protects the metal from scratches, stains, and further oxidation\nI also expect that action would drive most neat freaks up the proverbial wall, but from a chemical and heat aspect - a single lit cigarette doesn't have enough heat to do any damage. It would slightly warm up a small area of the case but do no harm to the insides. Also, I've seen solid aluminum ashtrays in use for tens of years in harsh environments with no real pitting or permanent damage to them. An internet search for \"milled aluminum ashtray\" or \"milled aluminum engine block\" will show that aluminum (and aluminum alloys) can stand up to substantial heat in diverse settings.\nI would be more concerned at the smoke, tar, nicotine getting inside the display and the Mac, corroding the circuit boards, covering contacts in ports and clogging the blowers over time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tacky, messy, provoke a reaction in others? - yes\n\n*Damage the aluminum surface? - not so much\n\nA: Yes, you can. But the aluminum surface will very likely be stained and contaminated due to the tar and ash getting lodged in the microscopic surface features. This may not be perceptible after an intense cleaning but a thorough cleaning might do actual damage to the surface. In all, this is a bad idea-- like cracking an egg on the hood of your car in the desert to prove that it will cook. Your paint job will never be the same until it is completely redone, and aluminum isn't removable the way paint is.\n\nA: \nCan I put out a cigarette on aluminum Mac Books?\n\nNo, it is simply not possible. Apple only ever released Macbooks in plastic and polycarbonate models. While Apple did announce in October of 2008 an all aluminum MacBook model, the updated line of unibody MacBooks were rebranded as MacBook Pro on 8 June 2009 at Apple's 2009 Worldwide Developers Conference.\n", "Q: Move files to individual folders, using file name as folder naming convention for folder, using Terminal I've been looking for answer on the web now for a few hours and can't find what im looking for.

I've tried both USB ports on the rMBP and neither seems faster than the other. I checked the Apple support website and it was said to be a bug in iOS 7, but my iPad was charging fine for a few weeks after I updated.  What could be some possible causes of this.\nNOTE: the battery drains at a normal rate.\n\nA: Put it into the Airplane mode and switch off the screen while charging. It will charge faster.\n\nA: The USB on a computer is not as punchy as a 10W Power adapter (2 Amps). \nIf you want a fast recharge, you should better use a power adapter. \n", "Q: How to reformat/install new SSD on MBP late2010 using OS X Internet Recovery I had been saving some money to buy an SSD and finally I did. My old HDDs motor shut down so I had to replace it. I put it in the macbook all good but it isnt recognized by the system as a hard drive so I cant select it when I am trying to install the OSX from the OS X Internet Recovery option.\nI think this is done because of the new SSD being NTFS (possibly from the factory) and not OSX enabled (fat) by default.\nIs there a way to format (and maybe partition) the new SSD so its recognizable in internet recovery mode? \n(I dont have another macb or external drive or a clean (not infected) computer to connect the SSD and format it from there.\nSSD I am using is: ADATA SP9000 256GB.\nI have no backup of my old HDDs files/os/image/anything, sadly I didnt backup.\nMy ultimate goal is to be able to use the SSD and also install later on partition of it windows.\nThanks in advance for all your help.\n\nA: For anyone in the future viewing this and having simmilar proble this is the solution: Start up the macbook and hold down CMD+R it will start the remote isntall procedure.

I tried uploading a photo from iPhoto to Facebook and the upload failed. I tried again, and it appeared to fail. Blaming my internet connection, I tried again. The upload worked. Then I took a look at the album online and two or three copies of the photo were in a moderation queue. \nI deleted them, thinking all was well. Except it wasn't. The captions on all of my photos are the same as that one photo that uploaded a few times. I blame Facebook, but I'm wondering if I can recover an older copy of my iPhoto library from Time Machine and use that to restore my captions.\nIs there any way for me to get an older version of my iPhoto library from Time Machine?\n\nA: There are two ways to do this: \n\n1- You could open the folder in the Finder containing your iPhoto library (usually ~/Pictures) and initiate Time Machine by clicking the icon in the OS X system tray and selecting \"Enter Time Machine.\" Use the time browser functionality to select a date that you wish to restore, then select the iPhoto library file, followed by the \"Restore\" button (see screenshot above)\n2- You could manually browse to the location of your iPhoto library in the Time Machine backup. To do this, open the Finder, and locate the Time Machine drive that you use to backup your Mac. Double-click to open the disk image for the backup of your Mac, then navigate to Backups.backupdb | [Computer Name Here] | [Folder Containing Date You Wish to Browse] | [Macintosh HD] | Users | [Your Username] | Pictures. In this folder, you will see the iPhoto library file for the backup date that you are browsing. You can copy it to your Mac and optionally replace your local copy of the iPhoto library, if needed. \n", "Q: Applying finder tags to applications - What are the consequences? I'm trying to put Maveric's new feature - Finder Tags - to a good use, so I have a bunch of installed applications, some I have read/write permissions but for some others I don't (All apps installed by the OS and some others, such as Parallels Desktop, to give one example).\nSo if I want to get a list with all apps bundled in OSX I could by typing this to Spotlight:\ntag:OsApp\n\nApps installed (not bundled in OSX):\ntag:MyApp\n\nThe beauty in it is I could, also, find all the web browsers installed (by OSX or by me) by doing this:\ntag:WebBrowser\n\nOr get only the browsers installed by me:\ntag:MyApp tag:WebBrowser\n\nSo far so good, but here is my potential issue:\nTo be able to tag some apps I should enable write permissions on them, tag the apps, then restore the permissions as it were before I tagged those apps. What happens when there is an update for an app I've tagged by changing its permissions?\nWill I get an error? Will the app be updated successfully? Will the tag(s) remain?\n\nA: Since I've asked this a long time ago, now I have some thoughts about my very own question, maybe anyone else is wondering the same so here it goes.\nWill I get an error? Will the app be updated successfully? Will the tag(s) remain?\nBasically its a NO to both questions.\nWhy?\nWhen you update an app it overwrites itself. So no tags, at least not as far as I know and/or tested. And tags will not break any update, again, as far as I know and/or tested.\nIF someone posts a better answer I will choose the other answer over this.\n", "Q: Perian gave Finder broken 'click to preview' UI feature. Now, how do I get rid of it? I understand that Perian is (a) not being developed by its creators anymore and (b) it doesn't work on 10.9/Mavericks even though someone appears to releasing updates to it on GitHub (gathering from trying Perian on 10.9, none of said updates seem to be related to 10.9 support).\nI uninstalled this now apparently useless framework by clicking the Uninstall button in preferences, then removing the prefpane and rebooting.\nThe problem is that FLAC files still are read as a 'musical' MIME type - or something - by Finder. They have the preview music icon when they should be blank, but more confusing is that hovering over them gives a Play/Pause functionality which never actually plays anything (the icon just starts 'spinning' when you click it) Check the screenshot.\n\nHow do I get rid of this leftover broken functionality?\nAlso note: when I press space on a selected FLAC file, Quick Look correctly makes no attempt to play it - but Perian has left another annoying mark as QL throws up the musical notes icon - as if you could play it in QL):\n\n\nA: Alright, here's how I got rid of\n- FLAC files having those ‘click to play' icons and their ensuing endless 'preview loading' spinning wheels.\n- FLAC files with those Quicktime/iTunes style music icons \nWe don’t want either because at least in 10.9, neither Quicktime nor Finder nor Quick Look can play them (even with Perian installed). A fresh installation of OS X simply gives you no option to play FLAC files whatsoever, but when you uninstall Perian, which is supposed to let you play such exotic formats, the option to preview FLAC in Finder et al is not removed.\nApparently the problem is caused by Perian associating FLAC files with the Quicktime Player. \n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on a FLAC file with a specious ''  \n\n*Choose 'Open With' and select 'Quicktime Player'\n\n*Quicktime Player says ‘converting’ in the video window for a couple of seconds then gives you a dialogue box saying it cannot play the FLAC file after all.\n\n*Close Quicktime\n\n*Close Your Finder windows and reboot OS X.\n\n\nThink of this as a way to completely remove all traces of Perian after you've uninstalled it.\nNow when you interact with FLAC files in Finder they should look like this again:\n\n\n\nA: QuickLook is just showing the icon. If no preview is available for a file, this is what happens. As you can see in the screen shot you posted, this is the icon your system is using for music without any embedded (or readable) artwork.\n", "Q: Moving text on OneNote for iPad I'd like to move text boxes on the official OneNote iPad app, but can't figure out how to do so.\nI've tried tapping and dragging, and double-tapping and dragging, but both only scroll the page.\n\n\nA: I am a regular user of the current OneNote iPad app.  Your only option for moving the text boxes is to use the iOS method for selecting, cutting and pasting.  There is not currently a way to grab text box handle and move the entire box like you can with the desktop app.  \nAfter you select and cut your text, tap into the area of the page you wish to move the box and then tap and hold and paste.\nFWIW, the rumor mill says that Microsoft will release a full-on touch compatible version of the office suite, including OneNote for the iPad very soon.  Hopefully that version will support more of the features of the desktop app like moving the text boxes.\nHappy computing.\n\nA: You can use onenote online to move and size text boxes\nthen switch back to app to further edit\n\nA: I use a program called Outline+.\nIt will let you move and size just like using the program on a desktop.\nIt will also sync with your OneDrive files.\nIt would be nice if Microsoft could add this.\n", "Q: How to install the RHIDE C++ IDE in OS X? I'm looking to mimic the environment of the classic Turbo C++ compiler from the DOS days on Mac OS X. I have used DOSBox with actual Turbo C++ installed in the virtual drive, but I'm just experimenting with other options.\nI've been writing basic C++ programs using nano and compiling them with g++, but I'm looking for something more integrated and TC++-like.\nI found RHIDE, which appears to be a clone of the Turbo C++ IDE and is available for both DOS and Linux.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure which package I should be downloading and where I should be installing it.

I'm currently using Filevault on Mountain Lion on one of my machines and on Mavericks on another one. Recently, I discovered Truecrypt, which does similar work to Filevault.\nDoes anyone know what's the difference between those two and which one is better?\nDoes Truecrypt decrease the performance of the OS comparing to Filevault?\n\nA: Truecrypt's main selling point is that it runs on windows, various flavours of linux and  OSX, too. From their website, it says that they offer many encryption techniques each with a minimum of 256-bit encryption.\nFileVault uses XTS-AES 128-bit encryption, which is a different form of encryption, but despite it's misnomer actually has 256 bits of encryption.\nFileVault is tightly integrated into the OS, so it's probably easier to use. If your use case is over many computers with different OS's on them (windows, linux, as well as mac) then I'd go for Truecrypt for continuity.\nIt's important to remember that the security of these drives is limited by the length of your password. This article has an interesting discussion for further reading.\n\nDoes Truecrypt decrease the performance of the OS comparing to Filevault?\n\nWithout any testing whatsoever, I would guess that they're comparable in speed, since they are both on-the-fly encryption techniques, and perform as normal drives once unlocked.\nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention that TrueCrypt also supports encrypting just a portion of your hard drive, say a folder or a group of folders. \nFilevault doesn't support encryption of individual files/folders. However, Disk Utility will allow you to create an encrypted image. (which can use either 128-bit OR 256-bit AES encryption)\n\nA: TrueCrypt and Filevault offer many of the same functions but they are different in many ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*TrueCrypt is advertised as open source, although there is some debate about this.  Filevault is definitely closed source.\n\n*TrueCrypt hasn't been released an update in over two years.  Filevault is presumably updated with new releases of OSX.\n\n*Filevault 2 will let you encrypt not only a whole partition but also the boot partition.  There are some risks around this because the encryption keys have to be stored on a recovery partition that is unlocked with your password at login.\n\n*TrueCrypt does not really support boot drive encryption under OSX.  You can encrypt an entire volume or create an encrypted file (image) that can be mounted as a disk\n\n*Both allow you to use complex passwords, which you should do, but TrueCrypt also allows you to use a key file as well, which is just another way to increase the complexity of your password.  For example, in addition to your password, you could encrypt with a key file consisting of every third word from Romeo and Juliet.\n\n*TrueCrypt has an additional feature I've not found anywhere else that I think is really interesting.  You can create a hidden partition within the main partition.  See their documentation for the details on this.\n\n*TrueCrypt lets you choose different hashing and encryption algorithms, even allowing you to layer them over on another.  With Filevault you get the stock encryption included with the operating system.\n\n\nI'm a fan of both for different reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*I prefer Filevault2 for most day to day things because it's well integrated into OSX.  This is particularly important to consider when you realize on-the-fly encryption modifies the traditional filesystem.\n\n*I like the extra options TrueCrypt offers, not to mention the cross-platform functionality\n\n\nSome final things to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Filevault stores a boot drive encryption key on the recovery partition.  By default, access to these keys will be as weak as your login password.\n\n*Take advantage of all the repair and salvage options Filevault and TrueCrypt offer.  It is more difficult to recover data from an encrypted volume than a standard one.\n\n", "Q: Missing \"Prevent App Nap\" button on app I have an app for which I want to prevent app nap.

A CRAN binary install of R suffices.\n Building R.app\nOnly Mac OS X 10.6 and higher are supported, and only 64-bit R. The\nproject is called \"R.xcodeproj\" and requires Xcode 3.2 or higher.\nThe project can be built by selecting \"R\" target and \"Build\" inside\nthe XCode GUI.\nSupported configurations are:\n  SnowLeopard64 (release, current OS X, default)\n  Lion64 (release, OS X 10.7+, Xcode 4.5+)\n  MLion64 (release, OS X 10.8+, Xcode 4.5+)\n  Debug (with debugging output, current OS X)\nThe configurations differ mainly in the SDK selected (recent versions\nof Xcode only support the current and immediately previous SDKs, so\nfor example in Mar 2013 the default would build for 10.8, but\nconfiguration Lion64 allows building for >= 10.7).\nTo build the project from the command line in the Mac-GUI directory\nuse something like:\n    xcodebuild -target R -configuration SnowLeopard64\nTo build the R for Mac OS X FAQ use either\n    xcodebuild -target Docs\nor manually in docs folder\n    makeinfo -D UseExternalXrefs --html --force --no-split RMacOSX-FAQ.texi\nThe resulting html FAQ file will be found in Mac-GUI/docs directory.\nNote about binary compatibility:\nThe general rules for R apply, that is binary compatibility is given\nonly if the major and minor version numbers match - only the patch\nlevel may differ. When using the X.Y.Z version form it means that X.Y\nmust match. For example R-GUIs linked to 3.0.x and 3.1.x are NOT\nbinary compatible.\nThe compiled R.app is usually bound to a specific version, such as\n3.0.1. If you upgrade R removing the older version, let's say using\nR.app built for 3.0.0 and updating R to 3.0.1, you may need to fix the\nabsolute path to libR.dylib. The nightly builds use a generic path\n/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libR.dylib which points\nto the latest version of R, but this is done by an additional call to\ninstall_name_tool in the building script.  Release versions of the GUI\nuse a fixed-version path as they come with a specific R version (in fact\nthe default behavior doesn't depends on the GUI, but on libR.dylib -\nchanging its own reference entry changes the way R.app is linked).\n", "Q: How to Open .dist extension as folder on Mac OS X?

Your attempts are correctly flushing the computer wide cache but you also need to flush the browser's private cache.\nAfter each edit of /etc/hosts reset the mDNSResponder cache using this Apple technical note, OS X: How to reset the DNS cache:\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache\n\nAfter doing this, reset your browser caches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari: use the menu item Safari > Reset Safari.\n\n*Chrome: use the menu item Chrome > Clear Browsing Data.\n\n\nA: In OS X 10.9 Mavericks, there are problems with trying to list multiple hostnames on the same line of /etc/hosts. I tried all of the other DNS-related tips in this post and the related post to no avail, until I stumbled on the \"problems\" link above.\nI used to have something like this:\n127.0.0.1 localhost host1 host2 host3 ...\n\nbut I found that resolution of those hosts would either take forever or not work at all. Trying to access the sites via browsers would be generally OK (although sometimes very slow to resolve), but trying to ping from the command line would not work.\nChanging it to the following format made everything work fine for me, and things now work great with ping, in the browser, and everywhere else:\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n127.0.0.1 host1\n127.0.0.1 host2\n127.0.0.1 host3\n\nMore details.\n\nA: On top of Graham's answer, try chrome://net-internals/#dns (for Google Chrome) to see what is cached.  Then click Clear Host Cache to wipe it all out.\n", "Q: MacBookPro Ram Frequency i have a MacBookPro 5,5 (Intel Core 2 Duo 2,26GHz) with Snow Leopard.\nActualy i've 2 ram block of 2GB (total 4GB) of DDR3 at 1067MHz.\nNow i'm buying 2 ram bloc of 8GB of DDR3 but at 1600MHz, could i've problems?\nThis is the ram i'm going to buy: \nhttp://www.amazon.it/Komputerbay-MACMEMORY-PC3-12800-1600MHz-204-Pin/dp/B009GYVK1O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1392556082&sr=8-2&keywords=macmemory+16gb\nI hope they will run at maximum frequency that motherboard support. \n\nA: MacBookPro 5,5\nHas a maximum RAM capacity of 8 Gig.

Play around with the keyboard for 5 minutes, don't worry about your fingers covering the letters.\nAlso, experiment with the voiceover and assistive touch settings to see what different input lag settings do and also changing the entire meaning of a tap (with voiceover) does for your concept of touch control.\nAlso, when playing - see if you can place your finger in the empty zone between three characters (two on one row and the key below the gap). Plop your finger down but don't lift it. Then pivot it gently, rolling on the fleshy part of your finger and see how the contact area changes as you rotate your finger. You can drop your finger where you think the letter is and then adjust before lifting.\nAfter playing a bit, you will quickly get better as long as you don't get too frustrated with yourself. Just as learning to ride a bicycle can be hard initially, this too is a fine motor skill you need to practice.\nI've never met anyone that couldn't learn to type due to physical size of their digits. Of course nerve / control / other physical limitations such as missing bones or digits is an entirely different situation than being used to seeing where you tap and/or not training up a new skill.\nIf you have an issue typing, there are now switch controls, voiceover, assistive touch, accessibility options galore on iPhone and iOS.\nIf your issue is attitude or feeling it’s not worth learning a new skill since you prefer a keyboard you can connect a keyboard or buckle up and start learning a new skill.\nDon’t allow yourself to think you’re too impatient, too old, too young, too busy, too frustrated or just don't care to learn a new skill. There's nothing wrong with any of that, but if you give yourself a few days to adjust I think you just may start to like the keyboard or at least reach a level of peace and possibly comfort with how the touch detection works.\n\nA: I recommend turning the phone into landscape mode whenever possible (sideways orientation). This allows the keyboard to become significantly larger with each key being larger and having more space in between it and the next one. \nThere are some apps that are portrait only; they prevent you from using the landscape keyboard. However, many, probably the majority of, apps allow landscape mode. Basically all of the text-entry apps do allow landscape mode such as Messages, Email, Notes, Evernote, and the like. \n\nA: You can try a capacitive stylus for iPhone (like these ones).\n\nA: I can relate to someone who has a hard time typing using their fingers on the IPhone.  I have something called Raynaud's Syndrome which makes my fingers cold all the time.  Even in air conditioning my fingers and hands will turn a bluish purple color and I am guessing that is the reason that no matter how many times I put my fingers on the keyboard or another example when I try to answer a call and someone has left me a message and I need to press on voicemail nothing happens.  My husband can come along and he puts his finger on it and gets it to work.  Therefore, I always use a stylus to type.  Being that I worked my entire career knowing how to type using both hands in the beginning this took me awhile to get my speed up, but now I can type really fast with a stylus.  I see nothing wrong with using a stylus as long as it gets the job done.  \n\nA: I had the same problem so I created an iPhone keyboard that solves this. It is free and open sorce.\nhttp://www.milgra.com/fat-fingers-keyboard.html\n", "Q: How many displays on MacBook Pro 2011 How many displays can I connect on my MacBook Pro early 2011?\nNow I use extender monitor, but the screen of MacBook is off, like this\nmacbook http://shrani.si/f/V/wG/3dRsX6iy/screen-shot-2014-02-18-a.png\nand I forced my graphic card to non automatic switch\nmonitor http://shrani.si/f/35/qq/4Oq2JVmK/screen-shot-2014-02-18-a.png\n\nMy question is next: \nCan I use 2 LG TV displays? or I must buy MBP retina?\n\nGreetings Andrej\n\nA: Yes, you can, since your computer has a Thunderbolt port (http://support.apple.com/kb/sp620).

But the new messages opens up in Apple's Mail client.\nHow to create a 'New Email with Attachment' option in Finder?\nAny ideas if what I want to do is possible?\n\nA: Try mutt, the command line email client that you can use with shell scripting: \nThis page seems like a excellent resource:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mutt\nNew email from command line:\nmutt -s \"Subject\" somejoeorjane@someserver.com -a somefile < /tmp/sometext.txt\n\nNow you just need to modify that to go to Drafts instead of send (I have not tried this).

We have an OS X mac mini server that stores/shares our files and our Time Machine backups (which is why AFP needs to be enabled).\nWe were having issues with AFP and network files being held open indefinitely, so we've switched to SMB for file sharing; everything is resolved in regards to that.\nThe current issue, is that selecting the server name in the Finder sidebar attempts to connect via AFP. So, users need to open Finder, select Go -> Connect to server, each time they want to connect. This is becoming frustrating for users who have laptops. Is there a way to advertise the SMB shares over bonjour so that the SMB connection to the server will show up in the Finder sidebar? Or another better way so that users don't have to constantly go through the menu to access their network files?\n\nA: I usually just do shortcuts- either on the desktop or in the dock (a little more dynamic)\n\nA: The way to do it is to add the shared volume(s), not the machine to the \"Favorites\" section of the Finder sidebar.\nConnect to the server using the Finder menu item and mount all the volumes the user requires. Go to the machines Finder folder and you will see icons for all the mounted volumes. Drag them one by one into \"Favorites\".

I'd like to be able to use it at the same time if possible.\n\nA: I think you are going about this the wrong way.  You are looking defensively when you should be on offense.\nConsider getting something like a privacy shield to place around the urinator:\n\nAnother alternative might be to simply bring physical pain into the mix.

Occasionally when I am using iPhoto an app with a generic white Lego piece icon opens on the dock with the name \"com.apple.MediaLibraryService.xpc\". \nActivity Monitor lists it as \"(Not Responding)\" and shows it using a pretty large amount of CPU time. When I quit iPhoto its % CPU drops to zero, but it remains in the dock and remains unresponsive in Activity Monitor.\nIt doesn't happen every time I use iPhoto, and there doesn't seem to be any particular action that triggers it to open. It does seem to correspond to a general slowing of responsiveness (already not great) in iPhoto. I am generally loathe to force quit something if I don't know what it is.\nDoes anyone know what this app does, why it is opening, and how to prevent it from hogging my CPU when I'm working?\n\nA: The com.apple.medialibraryservice.xpc is a process used for a number of Apple-specific applications and services, including: indexing photos through iTunes (when syncing), and importing and exporting images in iPhoto. \nSome users have reported that this happens when importing slo-mo videos into iPhoto from the iPhone 5s.

But the alternative to stick with the unpatched earlier version of OS X was not a solution!\nAnyway, so I am on this crappy Mavericks and since I have either full OS freeze or some other weirdness, slowness.</rant>\nToday's one is \"simple\": the finder freezes while browsing the local SDD too often!\nI open finder, go under Documents (on my local SSD) it contains only 31 items, 5 PDF wiht size 10-50MB, 1 PDF fo 300MB, the rest are small TXT, ODS, XLS, HTML of < 1MB and 5 subfolders. While scrolling through the view, it freezes, sometimes the display in the finder windows is all white, sometimes the beach ball is turning, sometimes you wait just a couple of seconds, some other times it is closer to 20 sec.\nDocuments is one example, but it is not limited to that folder sadly. Even the home folder which contains 15 subfolder and 3 files (for a total of 500kB!!) has such lock-up.\nThere is close to no activity on the machine, but when browsing the finder and when it locks, 1 to 2 processes are often quite active: Finder itself (always) and QuickLookSatellite (sometimes). Memory or disk IO/transfer do not show any spikes and are rather low in usage anyway. So there is no apparent reason for this behaviour than Mavericks quality...\nNote: I have tried this tips regarding Finder slowness, but in my case it did not help.\nEdit 01: I have removed all tags, but this did not help. However, I have found out that I have the problem in some of the Finder's view, so in the \"icon\" view it freezes for no reason but not in the \"list\" view for example.\n\nA: This answer may come a bit late for you, but I was able to solve this problem by removing the Finder plist and restarting Finder. You can do this in Terminal by entering the following command:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist && killall -HUP Finder\n\nGive that a shot and see how it works.\n\nA: Is it possible your disk is being indexed?  This can make the finder run a little slow.

This will tell you if you have a hardware issue with your SSD.\n\n*Re-download Mavericks from the Ap store, and re-install it.  This has fixed issues for me in the past.\n\n\nA: To investigate the problem, I remove FileVault (full disk encryption) which allowed me to start the computer using the guest account (not just the Safari limited guest account when FileVault is activated).\nIn this mode, I was able to test the Finder and see that it did not have slow downs or freeze.\nSo I had probably a third party tool doing some nasty stuff, and Maverick is not at fault (for once that I was ranting...).\nAnyway, after investigating which 3rd party tool I had installed or updated in the past months, I manage to found the culprit.\nI have Synology CloudStation client installed. When I quit the application, the Finder behaves normally. When it is started, then the Finder has these hiccups in the icon view. I have reported the bug to Synology which are aware of it and are in the process to fix it.\nAs a work around either quit CloudStation when using the icon view or switch to the list view in Finder.\n\nA: On my dad's mac and mine, the problem was solved by changing the \"arranged by\" setting of the finder from \"none\" -- which was the default option -- to either of the other options (say \"name\"). \n", "Q: File management 'Favorites' list customization Generally I'd do all my file management from the terminal but there are the cases where the GUI is more effective.

Unfortunately, this doesn't appear to work in Mavericks. Does anybody know a modern incantation to bring back the old magic?\nNOTE: this is not the same as reversing the scroll direction. It completely reverses all input and gestures on trackpad.\n\nUPDATE: I got it to work. Ray Shan's \"reboot the trackpad\" might be part of the magic. Also, five fingers + hard click seems to be crucial to activate.\n\nA: sudo defaults write com.apple.MultitouchSupport ForceAutoOrientation YES did the trick for me on 10.9.5 (required a reboot). I haven't tried defaults write com.apple.trackpad.orientation TrackpadOrientationMode 1. Possibly the two methods are interacting strangely with each other?\n\nA: This appears not to work anymore on MacOS 10.12 (Sierra). Corroboration from Apple discussion forum, here: https://discussions.apple.com/message/30704137#message30704137\n\nA: I just tried exactly same code, and it works for me in 10.9.3.\nYou can try reboot your Mac, naturally place your five fingers on trackpad.

Is a common problem on older hardware.\n\nA: Quit Disk Utility. Try this command in the terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1\n\nRelaunch Disk Utility. Select Show every partion from the now present Debug menu. See if you can find some hidden partitions and remove them!\n\n\nA: This was an issue with the hard drive caddy not recognising a 3TB hard drive. Have since tried a different caddy and my Mac recognises it fine.\nAppears to be a quite common problem if the drive shows up as around 801.6 GB in disk utility. A similar problem would arise in Windows with the disk showing up as around 746 GB\n\nA: If you load Disk Utility and select the drive (not any partitions) then the Partition tab you should be able to re-partition the drive. I assume you want a single, so select 1 Partition from Partition Layout\n\nA: Maybe your NAS disk was just one of two parts, and your case is a 2 HD enclosure, thats why is a 2Tb HD and one of them is less than 900 Gb.\n", "Q: Have to restart to switch external displays I have a Macbook Air 2013 model that I use at work and at home. At work I hook it up to an external Dell 27\" monitor via a display port adapter. At home I like to hook it up to my Samsung 40\" TV.\nWhen I get home after using the mac with the Dell monitor, I plug it into the TV and it doesn't detect the external display (the macbook blinks off briefly, as does the TV but that's it). Even if I go to preferences and hit 'Detect Displays'.\nIt seems to work if I restart my computer, but I would like not to have to reboot in order to switch external displays. Are there any steps I might be able to take to stop this from continuing to happen?\nEdit: I have also noticed that when re-connecting to my monitor at work I can't drag certain programs (iTunes, Sublime Text, maybe others) to my external monitor. They claim to be on the monitor, but aren't visible. Restarting the computer fixes this.\n\nA: I solved the problem in the past with two steps : \n\n\n*\n\n*If you start your computer screen drop but the monitor connected, the display will default to the external and your notebook is turned off. \n\n*To change which is the main screen you must enter the \"Alignment\" tab and drag the menu bar to the screen you want to be the main screen.\n", "Q: Robust OCR / scanning software recommendations Ideally I would like smart batch capabilities, emphasis on image correction and tweakable OCR. An example use case: I have photos of textbook pages - the most ideal application ever would adjust for shadows and noise, apply filters to clarify text, differentiate between text and pictures and process separately, deskew and warp to compensate for curved pages, crop correctly, provide tools for OCR adjustment, and compile into a PDF. Correct me if I'm wrong, but all of these tasks are not too difficult from a developer's standpoint. If this software doesn't exist yet, whoever does it best will make millions!\n\nA: Solved, with a great app called Prizmo. A few baffling interface problems (slides occasionally rearrange themselves or change their thumbnails to adjacent pages?!) but I managed to turn a set of low-light camera phone pictures of a textbook into a flat, curvature-corrected readable pdf. OCR didn't work at all but the images were so low quality that I was surprised at the few times it did; if I were more careful with the photography it could easily have read a page taken with an iPhone camera. Really great curvature correction, only a few interface adjustments would make this software perfect and efficient for a higher number of pages, like key shortcuts and some thought put into the curvature adjustment interface, or the ability to copy curvature correction settings over similar pages, or the somewhat obvious ability to pull 2 pages out of a picture/scan of a book.

After a while I forgot there is already a Finder instance, and open up a new Finder window. Upon hitting ⌘+w to close this new instance, the system automatically takes me to the very first Finder window I opened, not the Chrome window which I am currently browsing.\nExample 2: While in Finder, I click a pdf 1.pdf file and open it. Then I click a second pdf file, 2.pdf. Now if I use ⌘+w to close 2.pdf. The system will again automatically brings me to the window of 1.pdf, not the Finder window which I was previously working on.\nQuestion: Is there a way to modify the behavior of ⌘+w? so that while I close a window from an app A, I am exited to the app B before I open A, not other older instances of app A.\n\nA: No. To follow your first example, the Finder is the active application at the time you hit ⌘+w to close the second Finder window. So you remain in the Finder and the first Finder window is brought to the front.\nOne thing you could do is switch back to Chrome first (e.g. with ⌘+tab), then click the second Finder window's close button (assuming it isn't obscured by the Chrome window).

The Mavericks update has taken its toll on older hardware, and the reason tends to be that many of the updated features are really optimized for more powerful and energy efficient hardware. \nIf you open activity monitor, you will likely see kernel_task and mds running high. This is due to these \"improvements\" in the spotlight indexer.\nI have a 2011 MBP with a Core i7. My wife has a 2010 MBP with a Core 2 Duo.\nI didn't want to spend the money on a SSD for both of them, so I compromised and put a Seagate Momentous Hybrid Drive. It behaves much like a SSD at a much lower cost. Very affordable upgrade that will breathe new life into your Mac. \nI use my Mac for Java development and performance and quick wake from sleep are very important. The performance  improvement was enough that the only compelling reason I can find to upgrade to a new one would be to gain the extra real estate of the Retina display. \nMy advice would be to check the Activity Monitor and look into upgrading the hard drive. If you don't want to spend $300+ on a full SSD you will certainly benefit from a Hybrid Drive like the Seagate Momentus. 1TB can be picked up for around $100. \n\nA: How bout turning off spotlight? I guess that would make searches take longer but Mavericks is like pulling teeth the way it puts drives to sleep and you have to wait for it to be happy before it shows any directory structure etc. The concept of replacing perfectly good hardware that worked perfectly before the update seems a bit unreasonable. There must be a way to speed up work flow givene these \"improvements\" ;)\n\nA: Try verifying the volume using Disk Utility. \nIf that shows no errors, try creating a new user to see if the new user has the same issue.\nIf it does, check RAM and HDD (there are a lot of Tools, i personally like Micromat TechTool). \nIf that shows no errors, try reinstalling OS X and try a external volume.

Of course that doesn't guarantee the that your file is good. You might try to check the hash as Buscar mentioned.\nTo write the dmg file in Windows, you can either convert it with dmg2img if you know how to use the command prompt, or burn it immediately to a disk (or better: \"restore\" it to a usb stick) using TransMac (unrestricted 15-day trial).\n\nA: You can check with a public list of Apple installation media checksums (SHA1): https://github.com/notpeter/apple-installer-checksums#verify-checksums\nExample for checking on Linux:\nsha1sum \"Mac OS X Lion.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg\"\n\nIn the case of Lion the result should be a044fc01fa75b1f255dbdd6ea4fefa30cef147b0.\n", "Q: Tracing the forward use of values in formulas in Numbers I use Numbers version 3.1 on Mavericks.\nOne can easily look at a formula in a given cell and immediately see the other cell references it uses.

Mail.app will also automatically search for certificates as well.\nUnfortunately, I haven't done this personally, so I can't vouch for how well it works or have any advice on any issues.  This reads to me like a feature designed to be used with a centrally-managed IT infrastructure with directory and certificate services.  It does not sound like it is designed to work outside that sort of environment.\n\nA: If your question were about PGP, then the answer would be you could download the recipient's public key from pgp.mit.edu , for example.\nBut as for S/MIME, the keystores are scattered. \nIt is weird, since it is straight-forward to publish 1  your S/MIME certificate .\nBut the idea does not seem to have taken off. Case in point, here 2 is an announcement from 6/2/2011  , about 3, which today (2014), seems to have 140 users. \nReferences\n1 Sharing SMIME certs\n2 from google groups\n3 https://kuix.de/smime-keyserver/\n\nA: Not sure if this would help, but yes, you can create and retrieve certificates to save in your keychain.\n\nYou might also try this system:\nRetrieved a free certificate from COMODO \nhttp://www.comodo.com/home/email-security/free-email-certificate.php. \nPlease ensure, that you always select \"United States\" as you country of residence. Otherwise, you will not get a proper private key embedded into you certificate.\nAlternatively, you can look up the public key:\nUsing WWW or email methods.\n", "Q: Is there a tool to save a snapshot terminal session for later recovery, like a virtual machine?

I am using my Developer certificate to sign Automator Apps via the Export dialogue, however when distributing these apps (outside the Mac App store) via email, Gatekeeper still flags my apps as a from an unknown developer. I gather from the Apple Developer forums that non-App store apps are tagged with a quarantine of some sort.\nI am hoping to see if someone else has encountered a similar issue and found a workaround. Perhaps an Applescript I can add to my workflow that will remove that quarantine?\n\nA: Signature Check\nCheck your Automator application is being signed correctly. Do this using the command line tool codesign. Use the following command in Terminal.app to view the code signature associated with your application:\ncodesign -d -vvvv /Applications/MyGreatAutomator.app\n\nDoes the output mention your developer identifier? If not, revisit how you sign your application as it may be broken.\nQuarantine Flag\nThe quarantine flag is applied to files downloaded from the Internet.

I'd like to move all my iMovie resources (from an HD camcorder and my iPhone) to my Macbook Air but I don't feel there is enough hard drive space for me to do so.\nHas anyone here used iMovie sourcing documents from an external hard drive?  Could you comment on the performance?  I am not sure if I should be looking at an external thunderbolt hard drive, a usb3 drive, or if even a usb2 drive would suffice as I am not a heavy user.\n\nA: I haven't used iMovie specifically but I have used Final Cut Pro X. And AFAIK they source media the same way.\nGenerally, it works excellently if you keep the following things in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*The external drive needs to be \"fast enough\" (Basically: USB 3 or Thunderbolt)*\n\n*To save power most external HDDs will enter sleep mode after a certain amount of inactivity. When that happens, it'll generally take a couple of seconds for OS X to wake the drives when you start poking around in iMove again.\n\n\n(Optionally, HDD sleep can be disabled in System Preferences > Energy Saver but unchecking Put hard disks to sleep when possible)\nShort answer\nUSB 3 should be totally fine for you.\nLong answer\n\"In the old days\" (or on older Macs), when using USB 2 drives, you'd run the risk of not being able to read/write fast enough. But with your use-case and a modern Mac, that shouldn't be a problem.\nThe main rule: In general, the faster the drive, the better. This means Thunderbolt over USB 3 and USB 3 over USB 2 and so on. Opting for 7200 RPM instead of 5200 RPM is also a great choice. In the end it comes down to how much you're willing to spend.\nI can't point to an official source but Apple-Certified trainer Larry Jordan has a great article that explains the above points in detail. Also, I work at media company so I have a bit of experience on this.\n*I could throw numbers at you but since you mention \"camcorder\" and \"iPhone\" as sources, I'm guessing that telling you the number of ProRes 422 streams each connection type can handle, would be immense overkill :)\n\nA: While I don't have specific stats to share, I was in he same situation this past December - a ton of video to edit in iMovie '11; however, not enough space on the hard drive of my MacBook.\nI used a USB 3.0 external hard drive for both the events/clips and the iMovie project itself. I experienced no issues whatsoever. In fact, iMovie seemed to run better than when I was trying to edit with the videos bogging down my internal hard drive.\nI created a two movies (2 and 3 hours long) on the external hard drive…so from my experience, you should be safe doing the same!\n\nA: I have used USB2 7200RPM external drive as storage for videos - capturing them from camera, transcoding to allow slow motion. At that time I used Core Duo Macbook Pro and performance wasn't surprising. But if you have a lot of time then you can leave the Macbook to crunch the videos on external drive.\n", "Q: How can I attach a contact replying an email on Iphone with IOS7 I have not found a way to share a contact with someone that requested it by e-mail, I should be able to reply with an attached contact information, does anyone know how to do this?\n\nA: You can send your Contact card via emai from the Contacts app.\n\nThe above was for Mac contacts, in your case for the iPhone there is a share contact with the same functions.\nShare Contacts From Your iPhone Or iPad:\nOpen Contacts\nTap on a contact that you wish to share.\nScroll down and tap Share Contact.\nYou have three share options:\nAirdrop (use only to share with other ios7)\nMessage\nMail\nChoose the option you like, fill in the addressee details, and click Send.\n", "Q: Good kit for repairing iPhones?

I have bought 2x4GB and the iMac already has 2x2GB. I found the question was already asked by Mike Kwan here: \nHow should different sized RAM be added to iMac?\nHowever as I do not have 50 rep, I can not comment and when I went to put an answer in I am told not to ask questions or look for help in the answer.\n(So again sorry about the duplication question)\nAccording to Josh \" as long as your top two slots are filled using the original factory RAM and you installed the new RAM into the bottom slots\" the configuration is good.\nSo I looked at the image that Mike provided and compared it to the info from my iMac (after I had installed the extra RAM). As the 1st image of my configuration shows Bank 0 and 1/DIMM0 on my iMac contain the 4GB sticks which is in contrast to Mike's picture. I followed the install guide that Josh suggested regarding the \"Top and Bottom\" slots here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1423\nHave I missed something or have I done this correct?\n\n\n\nA: My understanding is that you want to pair your memory sticks in order to avail of dual-channelling, and are uncertain if this configuration is compliant.\nIt is. Firstly, apple recommends keeping the factory memory in the same position as it always has been. Failing that, it's only important to keep the same-sized memory in the same DIMM slot.\nAs you have above, both 4GB sticks are in the zeroth position, and both 2GB sticks are in the first position. This (or the opposite 2GB in zeroth, and 4GB in first) is the optimal configuration.\n", "Q: cd to directory with name of `-` I'm trying to make a folder called -. I know it's a silly name, it's named so to mirror something else.\nmkdir -\nls\n> -\ncd -\n\nThis makes it go up a folder or exit the symlink context depending on where I am. I found that cd - means go to previous location, but can't escape it. cd \\- does not work.\nAny way around this?\n\nA: You can use either relative or absolute paths to prevent the - from standing alone and confusing bash's build in command cd:\nmkdir ./-\ncd ./-\n\n\nA: Opposite to ~, which gets evaluated by bash, - is an argument to cd. Have a look at the man pages (well, for current systems both are in man bash as cd is a builtin):\n\n   cd [-L|[-P [-e]]] [dir]\n          Change the current directory to dir. [...]  An argument of - is equivalent\n          to $OLDPWD. [...]\n\n\nAnd the paragraph on tilde expansion (simplified to the most common meaning):\n\nTilde Expansion\n   If  a  word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`~'), [...] the tilde-prefix \n   is replaced with the home  directory associated with the specified login name.\n\n\n~ will be replaced by bash before passing the argument to the actual command. Thus, escaping it somehow (for example using '~' or \\~) will work. - on the other hand will be passed to the command. Escaping has no use: bash will not evaluate it anyway, but it will get passed unescaped as single string to cd, which will subsequently open $OLDPWD.\n\nA more esoteric alternative to Patrix' more reasonable way to open --folders would be to set $OLDPATH to -:\nOLDPATH=- cd -\n\n", "Q: How do I remove crashplan from my Mac I recently tried out CrashPlan on my Macbook, but I decided not to go through with that.  However, now that I'm not going to be using CrashPlan after all, I can't figure out how to remove their app from my Mac.\nI've tried simply opening up Finder and moving it to Trash but I get the following error when I try that:\n\nI've also tried deleting it from the command-line using rm -rf CrashPlan.app; even when I run this as root, I still get:\nrm: CrashPlan.app/Contents: Operation not permitted\nrm: CrashPlan.app: Operation not permitted\n\nI also tried doing this with the GNU version of rm, but I still get an error:\ngrm: cannot remove ‘CrashPlan.app/Contents’: Operation not permitted\n\nI ran, get info on the CrashPlan app in Finder, and I noticed this:\n\nHowever, when I uncheck the locked field and then try to move it to Trash, I still get the same error that I got the first time.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Um.  I just went to the folder Library/Applicationsupport/CrashPlan and clicked on the uninstaller icon.  It uninstalled and it is gone now.\n\n\nA: CrashPlan app contains an uninstaller built in. You can access the Uninstaller app by following the steps below : \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Applications\n\n*Control Click on CrashPlan App & choose Show Package Contents\n\n*Go to Contents Folder\n\n*Locate Uninstall app & double click to run it\n\n*Authenticate using Administrator password & wait for it to complete\n\n\nThis whole process should be over it a minute or two.\n\nA: A much easier solution is to simply run the included uninstaller on the disk image.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Fastest solution and worked on both computers was:\n(a) Go to http://www.code42.com/store/\n(b) Download free version of CrashPlan\n(c) After clicking to install the pop-up with the application symbol (that you drop into your Applications folder) also has a small trashcan in the bottom right corner.\n(d) After installation complete click the uninstall trashcan.\n(e) All old and new crashplan files get removed instantly.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the Finder.\n\n*Press Command Shift G\n\n*A dialog box appears: Go to the folder.\n\n*Paste this text into the dialog box:\nInstalled for everyone: /Library/Application Support/CrashPlan/Uninstall.app\nInstalled per user: ~/Library/Application Support/CrashPlan/Uninstall.app\n\n*Click Go.\n\n*Double-click Uninstall.\n\n*Follow the prompts to complete the uninstall process.\n\n*Remove the following directory from your system:\nInstalled for everyone: /Library/Application Support/CrashPlan\nInstalled per user: ~/Library/Application Support/CrashPlan​\n\n\nA: I used this and it worked for me:\ncd /Applications/CrashPlan.app/Contents/.Uninstall.app/Contents/Resources\nsudo chmod u+x uninstall.sh\nsudo ./uninstall.sh\n\n\nA: Since Crashplan runs with elevated / non-standard permissions for an ordinary app, you will want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall the same or newer version of the software to correct whatever changes non-standard or half-removed.

I even connected this Mac in Thunderbolt Target Mode to another Mac and tried to delete it that way.  No go.  I was at my wit's end, almost ready for a complete system backup, wipe and re-install.\nFortunately before getting that far, I was able to fix it by removing the \"system immutable flag\" via Terminal.app, using the \"chflags noschg\" command.\nIn the terminal:\ncd ~/.Trash/\nchflags -R noschg *\nrm -fR * # or empty via Finder\n\n\nA: There are other reasons for wanting to delete a specific CrashPlan.app\nI am in this camp. I have a backup copy of CrashPlan.app this is created by backup software and sometimes I need to delete the backup file and I get into the probem space of the question.\nIn this case, I am not deleting the primary CrashPlan.app and thus all the advice about uninstall does not apply.\nHere is what I had to do:\n# Change directory to the particular trashed or non-trash resident CrashPlan.app\ncd /Volumes/Mavericks_NonSSD/_CCC SafetyNet/2015-08-05/Applications/CrashPlan.app/\n\nsudo chflags -R noschg *\nsudo rm -r Contents/\ncd ..\nsudo rm -fR CrashPlan.app/\nls -lsaG\n\nAll is good now for me....\nI actually had to remove the CrashPlan.app from the trashcan and put it back where I deleted it from to get this to work, but it should not be necessary.\n\nA: On OSX the root user is disabled for security reasons. sudo might work, but if not, you can try the following. You need to login as administrator user. On my system, the default user (rxt) is not admin. So I need to do su adminuser, after which the adminuser password is needed. This makes you administrator, but not root. Now you can become root by using sudo -i. In some situations this is different from using sudo plus rm or some other command. If you need more rights, become root by using sudo -i! \n\nA: I couldn't trash Crashplan, either. And when I did option/click, revealing the Package Contents, the uninstaller wouldn't work.\nWhat worked for me was redownloading & reinstalling Crashplan. Then I did the option/click thing, ran the new uninstaller, and this seems to have completely removed Crashplan, including the pre-existing app that I couldn't get to move to the Trash. \n\nA: I couldn't remove Crashplan also, tried delete, show contents and run uninstaller no success. Downloaded the app again and you get a new uninstall option. This worked a treat.\n\nA: In terminal copy\nsudo rm -R /Applications/CrashPlan.app\n\nenter password, done.\nYou will still see the app icon but all process are stopped for good; for what I can see. \n", "Q: Installing / removing encfs I'm trying to install encfs, for which I need brew.

Using sudo is not allowed. \n\nA: You can fix the \"permission denied\" problem using this command: sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local\nThe easiest way to install encfs is using \"brew install encfs\". This will install all the dependencies (gettext ✔, boost ✔, rlog ✔, osxfuse) automatically.\nFollow the instructions on this website to correctly install encfs on Mac.\n\nA: Unfortunately it seems like osxfuse has been installed already, outside of brew, and with the root user. Since the permissions of the file are -rw-r--r--, you don't have write permissions to the file. This means that brew can't override the necessary files, and can't install osxfuse.\nThe only solution would be to use sudo or single user mode, and if it's not allowed, you can't install osxfuse with brew.\nHave you tried installing encfs directly from brew? As far as I can see, the only dependencies are rlog and boost, but then again, I already had osxfuse installed.\n", "Q: How to get Outlook email indexed by Spotlight after reinstalling Office 2011?

So it's not the keychain being locked while the computer is locked.\n\nA: Two things you can try are key chain first aid and keychain reset, altough these in-house solutions hardly ever fixed anyhting for me. This is based on the fact that when some apps keep asking for passwords stored in the keychain, it's sometimes related to a corrupt keychain DB (Address Book's empty DB comes already corrupt on every new Mac - sarcasm).\n\nA: To me Key Chain First Aid did not identify any problems, but removing the corresponding entries from the keychain and entering them again next time I plugged in the external drive solved the problem (for the last two starts ;)\n", "Q: Owner and Group owner of files in my home In my Linux installations (Ubuntu and Debian), under the home of my user I only have files whose owner is my user and group owner is my primary group.\nIn my OSX 10.8.5, under the home of my user (username enzotib, primary group staff), I also have files whose owner or group owner (or both) is different.

Is there any way I can enter my current version number and get updates for the next x-updates?\nI've updated 6 times already, and it's going to bug me because I have to do the same on another MacBook.\n\nA: Microsoft has major and minor updates.  Major updates include all previous updates, minor updates only have what is new since the most recent update.  Their downloads website has all of the updates, both major and minor, that have been released for Office.  The most recent Office update is the top of the list.  As of this writing (Feb 2014), the most current version is 14.3.9.  Its knowledge base article says that it only requires that you have version 14.1.0 installed, which would require you to do two updates (but not more than that).  Sometimes, I've seen it not get the update order right if you haven't rebooted your machine between updates, although I've usually not found that to be a requirement.  I've also seen people run into problems on updating if their license key is a pirated one, but I'm sure you're not doing that. :)  So, for your other MacBook, you should only need to do two updates if you're installing 14.0.0: 14.1, and 14.3.9.\n\nA: Microsoft Office 2011 updates only work when required version of software found.

I've tried poking around Apple's support site, but haven't seen anyone having my issue.  I have seen lots of people who seemingly don't know how to use SSH that well, so I decided to try another community.\nFirst, my configuration is working.  I am able to use my key pair and ssh to hosts as I need to, with my credentials being cached in the agent.  I am able to see my cached credentials via \"ssh-add -l\", as expected.  I am prompted to input my password by an OS X-style dialog, with a checkbox that says \"Remember password in my keychain\".  I usually ignore this checkbox, but when I check it, I do see my key stored in the keychain.  This key stored in the keychain is seemingly never used, however, since I have a password on it.  At least that's what I've gleaned from various things I've read.  When I enter my password into the dialog, and the key is cached in the agent, I successfully connect, but not before being told \"Saving password to keychain failed\".  Seeing this error message is what led me to investigate further; I don't like getting an error every time I connect.\nThings get interesting when looking at the manpage SSH_CONFIG(5).  Two options for dealing with the keychain exist, specific to Apple:  AskPassGUI, and KeychainIntegration.  You're able to toggle these in ~/.ssh/config, and doing so yields some interesting results.  \nSetting AskPassGUI to no, you'll no longer be prompted with an OS X-style dialog, instead an input text line in your terminal.  No biggie.  But if you do this, then ssh-agent will not cache your credentials.  This is plainly broken, and frustrating because I could easily live with the text prompt if the credentials were cached.\nSetting KeychainIntegration to no, ssh throws a hard error, as follows:\n~/.ssh/config: line 11: Bad configuration option: KeychainIntegration\n~/.ssh/config: terminating, 1 bad configuration options\n\nMy question, simply, is this:  Is there a way to actually disable OS X Keychain Integration for SSH?\n\nA: Based on the source code for the current version of SSH that's shipping with Mavericks (located here), it appears that the functionality of the config option KeychainIntegration has not yet been implemented. I'm making this assumption based on the contents of openssh/readconf.h, which does not reference the KeychainIntegration option. It does, however, reference the askpassgui option. Checking the \"keywords\" struct in that file does indeed show that the keychainintegration option is not present (which in turn implies that the oBadOption (NULL) op code would be returned).\nAnother clue implying that the functionality you desire is not implemented in the way the man page specifies is the file: openssh/keychain.c. The source code actually shows that the defaults system (i.e., Property List files) is being used to store settings related to KeychainIntegration. Specifically, lines from the store_in_keychain function reference KeychainIntegration:\n/* Bail out if KeychainIntegration preference is -bool NO */\nif (get_boolean_preference(\"KeychainIntegration\", 1, 1) == 0) {\n    fprintf(stderr, \"Keychain integration is disabled.\\n\");\n    goto err;\n}\n\nHere is the corresponding get_boolean_preference function. Note that it's using CFPreferencesCopyAppValue to obtain a boolean from the \"org.openbsd.openssh\" application identifier:\n#if defined(__APPLE_KEYCHAIN__)\n\nstatic int get_boolean_preference(const char *key, int default_value,\nint foreground)\n{\nint value = default_value;\nCFStringRef keyRef = NULL;\nCFPropertyListRef valueRef = NULL;\n\nkeyRef = CFStringCreateWithCString(NULL, key, kCFStringEncodingUTF8);\nif (keyRef != NULL)\n    valueRef = CFPreferencesCopyAppValue(keyRef,\n        CFSTR(\"org.openbsd.openssh\"));\nif (valueRef != NULL)\n    if (CFGetTypeID(valueRef) == CFBooleanGetTypeID())\n        value = CFBooleanGetValue(valueRef);\n    else if (foreground)\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Ignoring nonboolean %s preference.\\n\", key);\n\nif (keyRef)\n    CFRelease(keyRef);\nif (valueRef)\n    CFRelease(valueRef);\n\nreturn value;\n}\n\n#endif\n\nThis might imply that you can disable the KeychainIntegration functionality for yourself by performing this defaults command:\ndefaults write org.openbsd.openssh KeychainIntegration -bool NO\nor to set it for all users:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/org.openbsd.openssh KeychainIntegration -bool NO\n", "Q: Browse and Select unsupported files A website is asking me to upload pdf documents but once I browse to upload all the files (pdf format) they are greyed out and not selectable.\nI have tried Chrome, Safari, Firefox but there is no change in the behaviour.\nIt's not only one pdf, in which case I would think the file is corrupted or something.\n\n\nA: At least a fix for this in Chrome will be dragging and dropping the file to the fileupload control on the page.\nDrag the file to \"Choose file - no file selected\" and drop it there, it will be ready for upload.\n", "Q: PowerPoint 2011 crashes when trying to format shape Whenever I try to format shape (for example edit line) in PowerPoint it crashes leaving me with this error message:\nMicrosoft Error Reporting log version: 2.0\n\nError Signature:\nException: EXC_BAD_ACCESS\nDate/Time: 2014-02-20 12:15:50 +0000\nApplication Name: Microsoft PowerPoint\nApplication Bundle ID: com.microsoft.Powerpoint\nApplication Signature: PPT3\nApplication Version: 14.3.9.131030\nCrashed Module Name: WLMGraphicsDevice\nCrashed Module Version: 14.3.9.131030\nCrashed Module Offset: 0x000165cf\nBlame Module Name: WLMGraphicsDevice\nBlame Module Version: 14.3.9.131030\nBlame Module Offset: 0x000165cf\nApplication LCID: 1045\nExtra app info: Reg=en Loc=0x0415\nCrashed thread: 0\n\nIt's worknig on Mavericks on Polish version\nEDIT\nIf it's any help that what I found in system log;\nFeb 20 14:05:01 MBPTest.local com.apple.IconServicesAgent[316]: main Failed to composit image for binding VariantBinding [0x25d] flags: 0x8 binding: FileInfoBinding [0x353] - extension: ppt, UTI: com.microsoft.powerpoint.ppt, fileType: ????.\nFeb 20 14:05:01 MBPTest.local quicklookd[3607]: Warning: Cache image returned by the server has size range covering all valid image sizes.

Then clean install MS Office IN ENGLISH. It worked for me anyway - I've encountered the same weird behaviour on 2 machines with Russian MS Office, while the 3rd (with English one) was running fine.

Many times recipients of her messages say they are missing some of the attachments she thinks she has attached.\nHow can I turn off the embedding of any attachments into the message body and just displaying them as a 'file' icon somewhere rather than the contents?\n\nA: Using the Terminal.app you can set a default to turn off inline previews of attached files. The command to issue is:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes\n\nYou only need to issue this command once per user.

Am I going to have issues with this approach?\n\nA: A virtual install of OS X Lion runs without issue on Mavericks. \nAll the popular VM software understand Lion as an OS and should let you install it. I don't see you having any problems with this setup as long as your hardware is Mac.\n\nA: Yes. You can run OS X in a virtualized environment on another Mac. \nVMWare Fusion just added additional/updated support for OS X. I use it every day for development and it is very efficient (for a VM).\nI don't know if VirtualBox supports OS X or not, but I am guessing that it does on Mac hardware. \nHistorically, the problem with OS X in a VM was emulating the EFI firmware. But that is becoming more and more commonplace so support has greatly improved. \n\nA: Lion expects Xcode 4, not Xcode 3.  If you want to run Xcode 3, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a hack to get Xcode 3 working on Lion.  I'm not sure how well this will work in a virtualized environment, so you should report back here if it does work.  \n\n*Purchase a copy of Snow Leopard Server, and virtualize that.

The Cinema Display uses one Mini DisplayPort only.\nFirst, Using this Apple support post, can I link the Cinema to the iMac, link the iMac to the Windows 7 machine, and basically Cmd+F2 to swap BOTH displays between the iMac and the PC?\nSecond, must the Windows 7 machine be a Thunderbolt port, or will Mini Displayport suffice?\nAnswer: In the specifics from PacoSF's link the following answers have been transcribed for future readers, as well as for clarity:\n\nCan I use the iMac in Target Display Mode as a display for my gaming console, DVD player, or other device?\nThe Mini DisplayPort port on a supported iMac can receive DisplayPort compliant video and audio signals. Converters not made by Apple may provide options to convert other electrical, video, and audio protocols to Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt compliant signals.\nCan I use the built-in camera or connect USB, ThunderBolt, or FireWire devices to my iMac when in Target Display Mode and have them work on my main computer?\nA supported iMac works like any other external display while it is in Target Display Mode, except that you cannot access its built-in camera or USB, ThunderBolt, and FireWire ports. To use external devices while in Target Display Mode mode, connect those devices to the computer the iMac in Target Display Mode is connecting to.\n\nEdit: As a follow-up to this question, I have been following procedure and speaking with specialists. The newest iMac models in fact DO NOT support Thunderbolt-to-non-Thunderbolt video display in any capacity. I was advised submit this feature as feedback to Apple's Product Feedback page (apple.com/feedback). They also advised that if others desire this feature to submit as well, so that it gets enough momentum to provide a Firmware update to provide this feature.\n\nA: Target Display Mode is the term.

How can I prevent applications from being able to go fullscreen?  Or, if this is not possible, how can I escape from fullscreen mode of a (possibly unresponsive) application, without quitting the application?\nHere is the backstory for this question.  I recently purchased Cave Story + on the app store, only to discover that it crashes when opened in Mavericks.  Since the distributor doesn't appear interested in fixing the bug, I thought I might be able to fix it myself by tinkering with the executable.  However, when I start up the application with lldb, it goes fullscreen, hits a breakpoint that I have set, and becomes unresponsive, leaving me locked out of my own computer.\n\nA: It depends on how the application goes to full screen. If it is \"standard\" full screen that was introduced with Mavericks, moving the mouse cursor to the top of the screen should reveal the menubar with an option to \"restore\" the Window size.\nEven if it is via another mechanism (vis special code), standard app switcher options should work. your options include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cmd + Tab - swicthes between apps\n\n*F3 on a standard Apple keyboard opens Mission Controls*\n\n*You can set up hot corners (System Preferences -> Desktop and Screensaver -> Hot Corners) to go to desktop or all windows by moving your mouse cursor to a corner of the screen to go to desktop or another app\n\n*Connect an additional monitor (if on a laptop)\n\n\n*This is not technically F3. It is the shortcut got by pressing F3. You may have to Try Fn + F3 depending on how your heyboard is setup.\n\nA: If you have it enabled a 4 finger swipe should let you get to other applications.\n", "Q: Changing Mac Folder Icon I'm running the latest version of Mavericks and I can't seem to change the folder icons. I've gone to get info and pasted it in whilst being clicked on the folder image but nothing happens.\nI've only had this iMac a few weeks. To set it up I used migration assistance, ever since doing that I've been unable to change the folder image. Everything I've tried so far has not worked.\n\nA: What you want to do is get the image that you are wanting to change the icon of your image. right click on the folder icon, and click \"Get Info,\" it will load the information, and at the top, it will show the folder icon as it does here.\n\nWhat you do is drag the new icon to where the folder icon next to School is. It will appear with a + icon next to your image, and let go. It will then change the icon of your folder.\n\nA: There are two ways to do this. Both require you to open the info window on a folder (Command+I or File>Get Info...)\nUsually dragging an icon onto the folder icon in the info window works. \nThere are times where this doesn't work and I haven't figured out exactly why. Sometimes dragging the image doesn't work either, so if one doesn't work, try the other.\nTo workaround this, open the image in Preview, select all and copy (Command+A & Command+C), click on the icon in the info window (which will highlight the folder icon) and paste (Command+V)\n", "Q: What is the double exclamation mark mean beside clip in mail.app \nI have received a mail, which has a double exclamation mark beside the attachment file clip, what did it mean?\n\nA: It means the email was marked as very important or urgent by the original sender.\n", "Q: What is the VPN icon in the menu bar? I have long wondered what the significance of the VPN icon in the menu bar is:\n\nAnyone know?\nEdit:\nI think people are misunderstanding my question.  It is the icon for the built-in OSX VPN.

The VPN gives me a secure, encrypted tunnel through a potentially insecure public network (like a cafe or airport).\nThat indicator changes when you're connected, and optionally you see how long you've been connected alongside it.\nThis is only for Apple's built-in VPN; there are others like Cisco AnyConnect, that use different encryption protocols; those don't use that icon. You must have a VPN set up on your computer for that to appear (SystemPreferences->Network, in the left hand column)\n\nA: If you have zoom turned on and zoom in real tight on that icon, it does -in a vague sort of way-, look like one of those RSA SecureID tokens that some companies pass out\n", "Q: Which Mac for Web development + iOS development I'm a Windows user, but I'm looking to get a portable Mac for web development and iOS development. \nI will be running sublime 3, Xcode and probably Nginx or XAMPP as my server. Would the 11-inch MacBook Air be a suitable machine? If not, what would be the minimum spec machine.\n\nA: The 11-inch MacBook Air would more than suit your needs as far as specs go.\nBut, the screen size makes it hard for developers who are used to multiple monitors or windows side-by-side.\nOn my 11-inch Air, I normally use apps in full-screen mode and use gestures to switch between them quickly, but I sacrifice being able to have side-by-side applications.\nYou might consider an 11-inch Air with an alternate monitor (or more than one) for when you can sit at a desk and get serious.\n\nA: I can warmly recommend you the Apple MacBook Air MD711LL/B\nSure it has its price, but it's definitely worth it IMO.\n", "Q: How to choose which FaceTime number to call I have a friend with two iPhones, two different numbers.  When I call her with FaceTime audio, only phone A rings.  How can I call phone B?  The phones have two separate Apple ID addresses, but they are both set to receive Facetime calls on their 10 digit phone numbers.  I have both numbers listed in my contacts as 'Home' and 'Work' for the same person.\n\nA: I'm not sure there is a standard way. It certainly isn't easy to find by using the Contacts or the Facetime app. But, it can be done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Send a text message to the specific number you want to Facetime\ncall.\n\n*Open the conversation thread.\n\n*Click \"Contact\" in the top right.\n\n*Click the symbol for calling.\n\n*Choose \"FaceTime Audio\".\n\n", "Q: Haswell 15\" MBP, Win7 x64, no trackpad or keyboard I've seen quite a few threads about this around the interwebs, but no solutions.\nI'm migrating from a 2012 15\" rMBP to a new (as of yesterday) 15\" rMBP, and am having issues with Win7 x64.\nI used Winclone to image the Windows partition om the old machine, transferred it to the new one, repartitioned everything, and restored the Winclone image. That seemed to work fine; all the files are where they should be. After recreating a VM in Parallels, I can boot the partition successfully.\nHowever, I can't boot directly into the Bootcamp partition. At the login screen, the keyboard and trackpad are nonfunctional. I connected an external USB keyboard, which didn't help.\nSo, I used Bootcamp Assistant to create a Win7 installer USB stick, and booted off of that. Same thing: When it gets to the first GUI screen, input devices are nonfunctional.\nSuggestions?\nI need the 750 GPU for several reasons, and would hate to have to return this thing.\n\nA: After playing with this for a 8-10 hours, I found a solution:\nYou have to have Bootcamp Assistant create the USB key, and download the latest drivers (first and second checkboxes) to the key. There's apparently some startup information created that will let the keyboard and trackpad work with the installer.\nOnce that's done, boot into the Win7 installer. It still probably won't install. However, at some point you'll be presented with an option for \"Load drivers,\" which appears in a few different places during the install.\nWhen you get the opportunity,\n\n\n*\n\n*Browse (on your installation media) to $WinPEDDriver$\\IntelxHCISetup\\Drivers\\xHCI\\Win7\\x64\\\n\n*Uncheck the box that says \"hide drivers for unsupported hardware.\" (Yes, really.)\n\n*Select everything it finds.\n\n*Hit next. Wait for the drivers to load.\n\n*Exit out of the installer, closing everything until you get back to the \"Install or Repair\" screen (first thing you typically see when the Win7 installer boots. DO NOT REBOOT\n\n*Remove your USB key.\n\n*Wait for a moment.\n\n*Re-attach the USB key.\nProceed through the \"Install Windows\" wizard, select your target partition (probably have to reformat it as NTFS, depending on how you created it), and proceed as normal.\nThere appears to be an issue with the way that UEFI handles USB 3, so this may not be an issue with a USB 2 key. \n", "Q: How to get push notifications for a user tweets on Twitter for iPhone on iOS 7 I can change the twitter setting on iOS 6, but in the latest version of Twitter on iOS 7, there is no \"Turn on notification\" button in the user's setting.\nHow can I set this?\nThis is how to on iOS 6\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Get-Push-Notifications-for-a-Users-Tweets-on-Twitter-for-iPhone\n\nA: The settings you're looking for were moved by Twitter to their site.\nNext to that, if you open the Twitter.app on iOS 7 you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the settings-wheel when viewing your own page.\n\n*Click on \"settings\"\n\n*Click your account name\n\n*Here you can manage the settings to get push notifications about each item (or not)\n\n\nA: You can now turn on notifications for users you follow on iOS 10 by clicking on the bell icon near the top right of their profile.\n", "Q: how to configure Surfraw on OSX? Has anyone had success configuring Surfraw on OSX? How do I get a working configuration for OSX? http://www.surfraw.org/\n\nA: Once you've installed it (I used Macports) your ~/.surfraw.conf file should look like this, at a minimum:\nSURFRAW_graphical=yes\nSURFRAW_graphical_browser=open\n\nThe open command opens the default GUI application for whatever it's passed. In this case it's passed a http:// URL so it opens it in the default browser.\n\nA: Surfraw 2.2.8 can be installed using either Homebrew or Macports.\nHere's how to install via Homebrew. These commands should be typed within the terminal application:\nInstall Homebrew\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)\"\n\nInstall Surfraw\nbrew install surfraw\n\n", "Q: iMessage inquiry to ease my mind I have discovered that at certain times, my iMessages are delivered as SMS instead; which is perfectly ok with me, considering I have it set up to do so.  My question is, under what conditions are the messages sent as SMS with both myself and the recipient does not necessary been in a wifi area to receive or send iMessages...is it that when the recipient has their phone powered down that it is sent as SMS, and if that is the case...why is it that I receive messages sent as SMS instead of iMessages from the same recipient...what exactly does \"...when iMessage is unavailable\" mean??? Thanks in advance for any/all response(s)...\n\nA: If the sending phone has no 3G or wifi coverage it will send as an SMS message. Otherwise it gets sent as an SMS. If the receiving phone doesn't acknowledge the message after 30 seconds (because it doesn't have 3G or wifi coverage, or it's turned off) the sending phone will give up on iMessage and send it as an SMS.\nIf the sending phone has turned off the setting to \"Send as SMS\" then it won't send as SMS unless the user manually does it.\nEDIT: If the receiving user has Messages set up on their Mac running Mountain Lion or Mavericks, and the phone is out of data coverage, the message could be received by the Mac and not the phone.\n", "Q: How can I wipe a disk from a Mac with firmware password set? I'm in a somewhat odd situation: I need to wipe the disk of a MBP, but I can't boot into Recovery Mode/from a CD/etc. as there is a firmware password set.\nIs there a way to wipe the disk from within the OS? (I guess the answer will likely be no, but I had to check). Or maybe just to \"remove\" the encryption password from the HD so as to make it unreadable?\nI've been looking around and have found several ways of wiping files (srm, \"Permanent Erase\", etc) but if possible I'd like to be more thorough.\nPD: A bit of background to explain how I got to be in this situation: I've been doing some work for a company where they use Macs so they've loaned me a laptop configured as per their policies (encrypted drive, firmware pwd, etc); once but I've finished the project I have to return the laptop but I'd like to clean it up as much as I can before handing it back.\n\nA: I am not personally aware of anything, but then I haven't done any work with firmware passwords...\nJust a thought though, can you take the drive out stick it in an enclosure and format it on another computer? I know it's not what you asked but it might do the trick if you have an external drive enclosure and another Mac (or even PC...)\n\nA: You can just delete the files and use Disk Utility's Erase Free space feature to make them permanently gone. Open Disk Utility, go to the partition you want to clear, select the Erase tab and click on Erase Free Space... This will give you options that depend on your OSX version.\n\n\n*\n\n*a slider with the settings Fastest, Secure and Most secure represent 1-pass, 3-pass and 7-pass wipes respectively.\n\n*radio buttons labeled Zero Out Deleted Files, 7-pass Erase Deleted Files and 35-pass Erase Deleted Files are quite self-explanatory\n\n\nYou may want to first go with a single pass to get an idea how long a single pass takes and then depending on your time allocation (or paranoia) choose between the multi-pass wipes. Note that 7-pass is good enough for NSA.\n\nA: Depending on the age of the Mac you may be able to bypass/remove the firmware password.\nDo you have a second hard drive available and administrator access?  If so then give this a shot, I'm giving you a general workflow but feel free to ask about individual steps and I'll do what I can to answer them...\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect an external hard drive (USB, Firewire or Thunderbolt, assuming it's an Intel Mac).\n\n*Use Disk Utility (Applications/Utilites/Disk Utility) to format the external hard drive as Mac OS Extended (Journaled).  This WILL destroy any data on the external drive, be sure to save anything important beforehand.\n\n*Install a Mac OS onto the external drive.  Mavericks is free, if the loaned Mac can support it then you can download it from the Mac App store. During the pre-installation process you are asked to choose the destination, choose the external hard drive.\n\n*Set the external hard drive to be the startup disk in System Preferences > Startup Disk\n\n*Reboot your Mac, assuming all of the above steps were done it should boot to the new system on the external disk.\n\n*Use Disk Utility to erase the Mac's internal disk\n\n\nHopefully that makes sense.  That's the general workflow I've used before to help people in similar situations (need to erase firmware locked Macs) albeit I've already had a bootable external disk available.  Feel free to ask for clarification on any steps and I'll edit my answer.\nAlternately... If you're only concerned about your user data, and have been organized enough to keep the user data in your user folder and have administrator access then you can create a new user and remove the original user account.  When you remove the user account you are given the option to remove the user folder (which would remove the sensitive data), along with a checkbox to remove it securely, which will write 0's over all of the data. \n", "Q: Safest way to copy files to AirPort Disk from the command-line? I have just started using an AirPort disk (a Drobo connected by USB to the AirPort Extreme). I am trying to decide what is the ‘safest’ way to copy files to the Drobo from my MacBook Pro, which connects to the AirPort’s Wi-Fi network (802.11n-only / 5GHz).\n(By “safe” I mean “able to tell that something went wrong during the transfer and throw an error” especially considering that I’ll be transferring large quantities of data to a disk which might disappear over a Wi-Fi connection. Seems reasonable to take an extra precaution or two.)\nIt appears that rsync does a checksum to make sure that the transfer was successful, according to this section of man rsync:\n\n-c, --checksum\n…\nNote that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking its whole-file checksum, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option's before-the-transfer \"Does this file need to be updated?\" check.\n\nExcept that I am not sure (and cannot find out any official source to tell me) if that is true for copying files between different folders on the same computer, since (technically) there is no “receiving side” in the traditional sense of copying from one computer to another. It certainly does not seem like rsync is taking extra time to do a checksum after the transfer, but that’s mostly guesswork, and I’m not sure how to test it sufficiently to consider any decision I might make conclusive.\n(In case anyone is tempted to suggest that I read the source code of rsync I’m not familiar enough with programming to do that. In fact, I’m not even sure where to find the actual rsync code that OS X uses. See also: links on this page.)\nThe relevant bit of scripting that I am intending to use is here:\nfor i in \"$@\"\ndo\n    /usr/bin/rsync \\\n    --8-bit-output \\\n    --exclude='*/.DocumentRevisions-V100/*' \\\n    --exclude='*/.fseventsd/*' \\\n    --exclude='*/.Spotlight-V100/*' \\\n    --exclude='*/.TemporaryItems/*' \\\n    --exclude='*/.Trashes/*' \\\n    --extended-attributes \\\n    --human-readable \\\n    --inplace \\\n    --itemize-changes \\\n    --links \\\n    --partial \\\n    --progress \\\n    --recursive \\\n    --stats \\\n    --timeout=30 \\ \n    --times \\\n    --verbose \\\n    -- \"${i}\" \"${DEST}/\"\ndone\n\n(n.b. $DEST is previously defined as /Volumes/DroboUSB-Backups)\nThis will also skip over files which have previously been copied, but fill in any missing ones, much like the \"merge\" command we all wish the Finder had.\n1)  Did I miss any options to rsync that I should use?\n(Note that I have intentionally not included --compress as most of files I’ll be copying will already be compressed.)\n2)  Are there any other programs that I ought to consider instead of rsync? (Alternatives have to be something I can script from the command line, so not Transmit or ChronoSync.)\n\nA: Using rsync is likely your best option and the flags enumerated in your question are reasonable.\nAn alternative tool to use would be dd. This tool approaches the copying process at a lower level and is often promoted where exact copies of disks are required. The dd manual has all the options. I prefer rsync for its relative simplicity.\nPost Copy Check\nYou may want to extend your script to perform a post-rsync check. Use another tool, such as diff to compare the source and destination folders are equivalent.\nIf diff does not provide the incremental control you seek, consider comparing the md5 hashes from the source and destination's contents. See How can I calculate an md5 checksum of a directory?\n", "Q: How to erase photos from my iPhone 5S? I am syncing my iPhone 5S with my iMac. In iTunes it tells me I am over my 64 GB allowable memory with the majority of the space being used for over 4000 photos.\nHow do I delete the photos from my iPhone? I would like to keep photos taken in this year.\n\nA: Plug device into Mac. Open Image Capture (in the Applications folder), select device in sidebar. Check the option at the bottom that says \"delete on import\" then import all files to the selected folder or program.\nI used to do this manually, only deleting older photos, but with the iCloud Photo Stream, you will always have the last 1000 pictures available, so there's no reason not to just delete all after import.\nYou may end up with duplicate photos. There are several tools you can use to resolve dupes. Personally, I dump all imported photos into a specific directory, then run a dupe resolver, then add the new images into my photo management programs. (Not an iPhoto user because it doesn't sync well between Macs. Don't know if it has any in-built dupe resolution. YMMV.)\n\nA: If you have iPhoto installed on your iPhone 5s, then you can do a \"select all\" of the photos you want to delete - or you can connect your iPhone to a Mac, and then via Image Capture select the photos to delete.\nIf your iMac is the master, then you can re-sync the photos taken in this year to your iPhone again, if you have deleted all.\n", "Q: Remove or delete a review from my iTunes app? How can I remove a customer review from my App in iTunes?\nI sent a message via Report a Concern and nothing happened.\n\nA: Reporting a concern is the only way to attempt to remove a review. The process is not instant and requires manual approval. If you've only just sent the form, wait a bit. If it's been a while and the review is still there, it probably means that someone has reviewed your complaint and declined it.\n", "Q: Group Settings in Mavericks Profile Manager I have successfully setup my Mavericks server with Profile Manager.\nI have enrolled my devices and all is working fine.\n(For example) I have a group with 40 users in it.

What format/bitrate would I have just listened to that sample in?\n\nA: AAC format at 256 kbit/s, m4a\nOriginally, songs were encoded using FairPlay-encrypted 128 kbit/s AAC streams in an mp4 wrapper, using the .m4p extension.\nFrom May 29, 2007, tracks on the EMI label were made available in a DRM-less format called iTunes Plus. These files are unprotected and are encoded in the AAC format at 256 kbit/s, twice the bitrate of standard tracks bought through the service. They are labelled as \"purchased AAC audio file\" (.m4a) rather than \"protected AAC audio file\" (.m4p) in iTunes.\nin January 2009, Apple announced that all music would be available in the iTunes Plus format, bringing an end to the sale of music with DRM on iTunes. In April 2009, the sale of protected music ended in western versions of the store, making all music in the iTunes Store \"iTunes Plus.\" iTunes Store users may choose to \"upgrade\" any of their downloaded iTunes music to iTunes Plus if they wish, but most songs require payment to do so. FairPlay DRM-protected music was still available in the Japanese iTunes store, up until February 22, 2012, when they upgraded to the iTunes Plus model.[105]\nIn September 2009, Apple introduced the iTunes LP format (known pre-launch by the code name \"Cocktail\")[106] which features visual, interactive content alongside album tracks and lyrics.\n", "Q: Viewing Medical imaging on Mac OS X ?

I am a non-english native speaker and therefore use the OSX's built-in look up service (three-finger tab and cmd+L in the spotlight search field) quite a lot.\nI was wondering if there was a way to keep track of or record the words I have looked up? (Applescript perhaps?)\nEDIT: When I three-finger tab it also gives me definitions from wikipedia. Could I utilise this, i.e. track the requests Dictionary.app sends to wikipedia.org, to track which words I look up?\n\nA: You can't do this with the normal three-finger tap, but if you make an Automator service with some Applescript, you can trigger it on a keyboard shortcut.

(These are also distinct from the system trust settings.) Note, also, that certificate trust settings are somewhat distinct from just adding a certificate to a keychain; you can mark a cert as trusted without fully adding it. (The exact situation here is not clear to me, and the docs I've seen are vague.)\nYou can mark a cert as trusted for your current user as\n$ security add-trusted-cert /path/to/cert.pem\n\nbut that doesn't help with root. The solution, as you might now guess, is either to sudo the above, which then marks it as trusted for the root user specifically:\n$ sudo security add-trusted-cert /path/to/cert.pem\n\nor to use the -d flag to add it to the admin trust settings:\n$ security add-trusted-cert -d /path/to/cert.pem\n\n(OS X will pop up a password dialog to confirm this one.)\nEither of the latter two seems to be sufficient for sudo curl.\nReference: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/Documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/security.1.html\n\nA: This is really in the output hint:\necho insecure >> ~/.curlrc\n\nAdvantage of using above solution is that it works for all curl commands, but it is not recommended since it may introduce MITM attacks by connecting to insecure and untrusted hosts.\n\nA: f you store your CA certificates on the filesystem (in PEM format) you can tell curl to use them with\nsudo curl --cacert /path/to/cacert.pem ...\n\nYou can also turn off the certificate verification with\nsudo curl --insecure ...\n\nEdit: Updated with regard to feedback\nIf you want to set this permanently, you should create a .curlrc files and place in your home directory. sudo commands may need this file in /var/root The file takes the same options as the command line but without the dashes. One option per line:\ncacert=/path/to/my/certs.pem\n\n\nA: If you use MacPorts (and the 3rd-party script you mentioned doesn't remove it from $PATH or calls /usr/bin/curl) you can install the certsync and curl ports in this order.\ncertsync is a tool and a corresponding launchd plist that will export your system keychain to $prefix/etc/openssl/cert.pem and install a symlink $prefix/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt -> $prefix/etc/openssl/cert.pem so MacPorts curl will automatically pick up the certificates. certsync will also automatically update the generated files when you change your system keychain.\n\nA: The documentation you are looking for is here. It explains how to use cURL on Mavericks and how to supply your certificates: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2013-10/0036.html\n\nA: To make sudo curl work (on OSX Sierra), we had to import the certificate into the System.keychain and trust it there. This could be done manually in the Keychain app or using this command:\nsudo security add-trusted-cert -d -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/cert.pem\n\nIt was important to both specify -d and manually set the path to the System keychain via -k to make sure the cert actually gets imported there if it isn't yet.\nThe command works without sudo, but then would ask for the password via a UI dialog, which might be a hurdle for scripts.\n", "Q: Is it allowed to incentivize users to leave reviews?

I've decided to switch from OS X to Ubuntu. I'm following the documentation on Ubuntu's site for creating a bootable USD Drive.\nI converted the ISO to IMG. I ran diskutil list. I inserted my flash drive and ran diskutil list again. My drive is assigned to /dev/disk1. I ran diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1. Then I executed sudo dd if=/ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64.dmg of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m. Then I ran diskutil eject /dev/disk1. Then I restarted, held the alt/option key. The Boot Manager came up, but my flash drive wasn't coming up as an option.\nI tried this again just now and it said \"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\" I've never had an issue with this drive before. I restarted anyway, just to see if it worked and I'm still only getting my main hard drive as an option in Boot Manager.\nWhere do I go from here?\n\nA: I have tested what follows on two different MacBook Pros:\n\n\n*\n\n*13-inch, Mid 2010 (2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 8GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce 320M 256MB)\n\n*13-inch, Late 2011 (2.8 GHz Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, Intel HD Graphics 3000 512MB)\n\n\nOverview\nCreate Bootable USB Drive using Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu itself.\nNote: I use Ubuntu daily as a Tomcat Web Server and Java Development environment, and I do so in a Virtual Machine. I understand this is not the most ideal arrangement for someone wishing to create a bootable USB disk to boot a Mac to, but it works, and has proven reliable for me. If you are bent on using Ubuntu natively and want to test it first, a VM is one way to do it, and booting to USB is another. For the full-on experience, installing Ubuntu to your hard-drive (after taking the appropriate measures to back up your harddrive, etc... <disclaimer>I take no responsibility for lost data, etc... </disclaimer>)\nThere are minor nuances to each of these scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*VM leverages the host OS Networking, so there are no issues with Broadcom drivers\n\n*VM will have issues with x/y coordinates of the display (0,0 being the upper left hand corner, for example), meaning hot-corners in Ubuntu will not work properly (for things like auto-hiding the launcher bar)\n\n*USB Boot will support your graphics card (most likely) and x/y coordinates will be mapped properly.\n\n*USB Boot will not have native WiFi support, so you will have to download Broadcom drivers using a wired connection\n\n\n*\n\n*This is true whether or not you are booting from USB or have Ubuntu installed onto your hard drive\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\nI use VMWare Fusion to create my VM's, which is a paid application, though there is a free trial. However, VirtualBox is free to download and use and from what I understand, works quite well also.\nThat said, I created a Bootable USB Stick using Startup Disk Creator in my Ubuntu 13.10 VM, so I will explain here the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu 13.10 in Virtual Machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*If this does not quell your curiosity as to whether or not to run Ubuntu natively, then proceed...\n\n\n*Download the Ubuntu 13.10 Mac image from here\n\n\n*\n\n*NOTE: There are 3 links to Ubuntu 13.10 for Desktop. You want to make sure to download the last one... labeled \"64-bit Mac (AMD64) desktop image\"\n\n\n*Insert a blank USB Key into the Mac, and if given a choice of which system to connect it to (VMWare Fusion recognizes this, and asks what to connect it to, Mac or your VM) choose the VM.\n\n\n*\n\n*This should mount the USB in the VM as a drive (Eg., it should have a mount point in /media)\n\n\n\n*Open Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu and choose the target device as the USB drive, and the source as the Ubuntu 13.10 ISO image you downloaded.\n\n\n\n*Accept the defaults, and click on \"Make Startup Disk\"\n\n*Close out all open applications (including VMs)\n\n*Shutdown your Mac.\n\n*Insert USB drive into Mac if it is not already\n\n*Press Power button to turn on the Mac, and immediately press and hold the Option key.\n\n*You should be presented with 2 or 3 boot options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS Startup Disk\n\n*Mac OS Repair Partition *may not be present\n\n*EFI Boot (this should have an Orange USB Drive icon)\n\n\n*Choose the EFI Boot.\n\n\nNOTE: If you use an Mac with NVidia graphics, you will see a scrambled Boot animation (The Ubuntu logo with the pulsing orange dots). This is due to the fact that Ubuntu defaults to the Open Source drivers for NVidia hardware, and they are not loaded yet. If you choose to install natively, you may want to try the proprietary binary drivers provided by NVidia.\nThe USB drive you see referenced in that screen shot has Ubuntu 13.10 on it and Boots successfully on the two systems mentioned above.\n\nA: It sounds like your USB flash drive is not recognized as being bootable?\nTry using UNetbootin (http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/). It should make your USB flash drive bootable.\nDownload the the version for Mac OS X and simply run it. Follow the prompts and select your USB flash drive, ISO file, or have it download the latest ISO for you. I've used UNetbootin several times under OS X for various Linux distros and it's always worked well.\n", "Q: MacBook not responsive when woken within the second it went to sleep I have a MacBook Air 11\" mid 2013 with all the updates.

I have a long history of chats, several groups and multiple contacts (who have me in their address books) on Whatsapp for iPhone.\nHow can I preserve them all if I switch for a week to a new SIM card (which I buy for travel, from a different cell operator)? Is it possible to make the switch seamless for my friends, so they don't have even to add my new number (and of course, I'd like that their history of chats with me doesn't break on this switch)? After a week, I would like to switch back to my original SIM card -- and again don't want to loose anything. My iPhone device will remain the same all the time, and I'm not going to reset it during that period.\nWhatsapp FAQ is quite unclear on this...\n\nA: It proved trivial:\n\n\n*\n\n*power down iPhone\n\n*change SIM card\n\n*turn iPhone on\n\n*launch Whatsapp\n\n*Whatsapp asks something like \"Mobile network changed.

I have a vehicle that has a 30-pin cable built-in to connect the iPod to the vehicle's stereo. But the stereo does not provide power to the iPod. Is there an adapter so that I can plug the vehicle cable into adapter (for data) and a USB cable into the adapter (for power)? I intend to get power from the vehicles DC outlet and an adapter to convert to USB.\n\nA: I think you have the wrong idea here.\nThe 30-pin connector for an iPhone has power and data ports. Your car clearly is not serving power to the power port of your iPhone connector. To do this manually, I'd recommend taking a look at the link below. It is based on giving power to a VGA accessory in order to power up the iPhone with this same plug.

I have tried cooling pads & fans but they don't seem to make much of a difference by any means. I don't have excessive processes running either, for the most part I'll have a text editor, terminal and a web browser running. \nDoes anyone have solutions? And is it odd to see this happening with such a relatively new system?\n\nA: I would also recommend the advice about using Activity Monitor to see what is using the processor and understand why the computer is getting hot.\nA MacBook Pro is made from metal and the case conducts the heat well. It might feel hotter than it really is. \nThere are a number of temperature sensors in the laptop which can easily be read by software. A search on the internet showed this application which you could use to read the sensors and may give you some idea of where the heat is coming from (although it is probably going to be either the CPU or GPU): http://www.bresink.com/osx/TemperatureMonitor.html\n\nA: It could be an issue with your Mac's SMC. System Management Control (SMC) is what takes care you your Mac's temperature control (not spinning up the fans when either the GPU Diode, or CPU get's too hot). It's very easy to reset your SMC, it's help me with similar issues in the past. Here's the link to Apple's support doc on how to do such; http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: It shouldn't be getting that hot if you're just web browsing and word processing with some terminal use.  If you bought it relatively recently, I'd schedule a visit to your local apple store's genius bar.\n\nA: Check Activity Monitor for any processes that are running excessively high processor/memory usage, and Console for repeating error messages. I had issues with a few system processes after upgrading to Mavericks; fixing disk permissions and then verifying/repairing the drive really helped. Any system processes that need to modify specific files may get stuck running if the files in question don't have the correct permissions. And definitely check fan speeds; if they aren't running as they should you'll have overheating issues.\n", "Q: Haswell Macbook Pro Drive Performance I FINALLY managed to migrate my triple boot mid-2012 rMBP to a new Haswell model, and was very surprised to see this in Win7:\n\nOn the other machine, the \"primary hard disk\" score was a solid 7.9. \nI had some issues getting drivers, etc. installed on this thing, so I guess it's possible that I missed something.\n(This is on a loaded 15\" rMBP purchased last week. 16GB, 1TB SSD, 2.6GHz.)\nSuggestions? Is this typical? Explanations?\nUpdate\nI ran Black Magic under OSX and the drive read and write speeds are within spec. Might be a driver issue under Win7.\n\nA: This turned out to be a driver issue, related to having an incorrect version of Bootcamp installed. (This was a result of having moved my Win7 partition from the old machine via Winclone.\nUninstalling Bootcamp (in order to get the new version installed) was a bit of a pain. Whenever I tried to remove the Bootcamp Services app from the \"Uninstall a Program\" dialog in Win7, I received a message\n\nThis version of Bootcamp is not intended for this computer model.\n\nFinally, I used the Microsoft Uninstall Repair Tool, which modified something that let me uninstall the old version of the Bootcamp utilities.\nI then ran the new Bootcamp\\setup.exe that Bootcamp Assistant downloaded for this machine. Installation proceeded without a hitch, though it took ~10 minutes to complete. I then re-ran the \"Windows Experience Index\" assessment and got a respectable 7.2 for the SSD:\n\nSurprisingly, still lower than the 7.9 I got on the mid-2012 15\" Retina with 768GB SSD.\nThe WinSat command-line tool provided more insight:\n\nwith a read speed of 1181.8 MB/sec, and a write speed of 1019.66 MB/sec. This is roughly equivalent with what BlackMagic reports under OSX.\n(Still, I'm wondering if Windows gives speeds > 1GB/sec a 7.2 of 7.9, what on earth do they consider to be a 7.9?)\n", "Q: MacBook Pro, Thunderbolt Display and overheating I recently purchased a Thunderbolt Display to use with my Late 2011 MacBook Pro 13-inch. I was quite happy with the overall performance until I noticed that the only fan in the laptop started running at overly high speeds (over 6000 rpm) to cool off temperatures surpassing 90C (194F) on the temperature diode/CPU die. This happens every time I watch a video and gets worse if I do so on full-screen mode. Most other tasks produce around 70C (158F) and 4000 rpm.\nThis of course not only produces annoying noise but reduces the lifespan of any affected internal components. This positively does not happen when the TD is unplugged. I have a couple of questions I was hoping people out there could help me with:\n(1) Will any similar (27 inch, 2560x1440) monitor produce the same behavior or is this a thunderbolt interface issue? Can my MBP drive a monitor with these specs without overheating?\n(2) How damaging can high temperatures be? Am I slowly killing my computer with the TD?\n(3) Am I asking my hawrdware for too much or is Apple basically marketing a 'computer overheater'?\nThank you!\n\nA: i don't know why, but when i stopped using the mag safe from the thunderbolt display to power my MBP, and just used my normal power adapter, I quit having the overheating problem. I've taken my display to apple several times and they can't figure out why it keeps overheating and turning off. \n\nA: The Sandy Bridge i5 CPU in your Mac is designed and packaged to run at 100°C so I wouldn't be concerned with the temperatures you are monitoring. The blowers should be running when you approach that internal temperature. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://ark.intel.com/products/60636/Intel-Core-Processor-i5-2435M-(3M-Cache-2_40-GHz)\nIf you log out and let the Mac idle for 5 minutes and en log in, the blowers should be back at 2000 RPM and the temperatures substantially lower. \n", "Q: Large File still taking storage after Deleted I downloaded a file that is more than 20GB, but after deleting the file the space is still taken, and it's not showing in the finder. I'm using a macbook pro with retina display 121GB with bootcamp and OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: If you have enabled Time Machine, the disk space could be taken up by local snapshots. When local snapshots are enabled, Time Machine saves snapshots to /.MobileBackups/ when there is more than 10% free disk space. See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4878. Local snapshots are not counted as used disk space in Finder, but they are shown under backups in the About This Mac window. The snapshots are deleted automatically if disk space is low enough, but since 10.9 the newest snapshot is kept even if there is less than 10% free disk space.\nTo see what files take up disk space, you can use OmniDiskSweeper:\n\nTo include folders like /.MobileBackups/, open OmniDiskSweeper as root by running sudo /Applications/OmniDiskSweeper.app/Contents/MacOS/OmniDiskSweeper.\nYou can also just use Finder.

I've made the mistake of changing the \"everyone\" permissions for the root of my Mac Mini server's startup drive to \"none\".\n(I believe) this would be fairly easy to fix with the Recovery Partition - except this is a headless server, and I can't locate my Mini-DVI adapter, so I'm monitor-less.\nmy question is: would it be possible for me to boot my Mini to Target Disk Mode, then connect it to my MacBook, and boot the MacBook from the Mini's recovery partition, to fix the permissions? I'm asking because I don't own the necessary FireWire cable, but I'll buy one if it can fix this issue.\nor, possibly, could I repair this using Disk Utility on the MacBook's own drive?\n\nA: Two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can repair permissions using Target Disk Mode from your MacBook - as you mentioned, you'll need a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable to do so. No need to use the recovery partition on the Mini - you can use Disk Utility on the MacBook to repair the drive on the Mini. In order to use Target Mode on a headless machine that won't boot, hold the 'T' key down during startup.\n\n*Alternatively - since you need to buy a cable, you could instead buy an adapter to connect a monitor (if you have one) & repair using the recovery partition on the Mini.\nI'd have both options on hand in case of issues.

It allows for both a quick test (basic memory tests, basic test for other components and a quick HD scan) and an extended test.  The extended test runs full verification tests on the RAM, the basic hardware tests and a full disk scan of the hard drive.\nApple has a knowledge base article devoted to AHT: Using Apple Hardware Test -HT1509\nBasically depending on the age of your Mac you have two options...\nOlder Macs that shipped with a gray restore disc/s or MacBook Airs that shipped with a USB recovery disk:\n\n*\n\n*Insert the gray restore DVD (or USB recovery disk if MacBook Air)\n\n\n*Power on your Mac while holding D\n\n\n*It may take several (15+) seconds for AHT to load, once loading though you should see this icon appear on the screen.  If you see the Apple logo then you will need to shutdown the Mac and try again.\n\n\n\n*Select your desired language\n\n\n*There are three tabs. About explains the tool.  Hardware tests runs the tests.  Hardware Profile shows the Macs configuration. The middle tab, Hardware tests, is the one you'll use\n\n\n*You have two options, quick test (the default setting) or a checkbox to run an extended test.  The extended test takes considerably longer (typically an hour although this will vary based on hard drive size and amount of installed RAM) but is more thorough.\n\n\n*If the tests pass you will receive a \"No trouble found\" message.  If the tests fail you will receive a somewhat cryptic error code.  This Cnet article does a great job of explaining the error codes. For what you're interested in though you'd be looking for a failure beginning with 4/MEM, this would indicate a failure with the memory test, either with the DIMM or the DIMM slot on the logic board.\nNewer Macs that shipped with 10.7 or above, or without restore media, will follow the same steps as above however they can ignore the very first step since there is no media to insert in the Mac.\nNewer, post June 2013, Macs will instead use Apple Diagnostics.  While similar to AHT in it's capabilities it lacks the option for an extended test.  You invoke it in the same manner as AHT.\nIf you're instead looking for a tool to run from within your OS then my tool of choice has always been TechTool Pro.  It's memory tests usually confirm suspected RAM issues.\nHopefully that helps!\n\nA: Memtest, a relatively inexpensive app @ $1.39, worked for me on several Macs recently, and I've been using it for more than a decade.

My iPhone lost when I was skiing. I think its in the snow and nobody can find it. I'm sure that my iPhone has about 40% charge but it turned off because of the freezing.\nIs there any way to find my iPhone with any apps when its off?\n\nA: With the phone off there is no way to locate it from remote. And to be honest, a few days embedded in snow will not only kill the remaining charge in the phone but also the electronics itself (water will slowly get in).\n", "Q: Mavericks Open Directory Setup I am trying to setup the Open Directory server and it keeps failing stating that     \n/etc/openldap/slapd_macosxserver.conf: line 229: invalid path: No such file or directory\n\nThis is on a newly installed server. Was there something else besides running through the wizard that I was supposed to do?\n\nA: The missing folder that the error is referring to is /var/db/openldap/openldap-data. This database directory must exist prior to running slapd. Try creating the folder if it doesn't exist and make sure that the folder is read/write by the system.\n", "Q: Unreliable iPad car connection cable I own a 2008 Scion (made by Toyota) which has a built-in port for connecting iPod/iPhone/iPad to the car's stereo for audio and remote control. I purchased the recommended adapter cable which connects the car's console to the the 30-pin connector on my iPad 3. (Link to interface cable PT546-21062 by Toyota) \nAfter a week or so, it started losing the connection if the iPad moved, so I started sliding the iPad between the seat and the center console to keep it still. This worked as long as I didn't bump it.\nStarting this week, going around a turn has been enough to cause the connection to completely fail even when the iPad is held in place. I've noticed the end of the adapter plugged into the iPad easily wiggles back to front.\nHow can I be sure the problem is the cable and not my iPad?\nI can still connect the iPad to my computer using the 30-pin to USB cable that came with my iPad, but that only uses 5 or 6 of the 30-pins the cable supports. I also unscrewed the console in the car and checked that the internal wiring there is all solid.\nWhat would be the best way to try to fix this? Are there 30-pin extension cables that have more sturdy connectors that would lock into the port on my iPad better?\nIs this something I could get help with at the Apple Store or would they not help since the adapter is made by Toyota rather than Apple?\n\nA: After testing with a friend's iPhone I replaced the cable an it is working now. The connection feels tighter than the old one did even when it was new, so the old one may have just been defective.\n", "Q: How to avoid re-verifying app store? My iPhone says “since this is the first time you ...” when it ISN'T.  And then it asks security questions which are NOT the ones I set.  Did the same thing last time I tried to download a non-free item, and I had to call Apple and spend ten minutes proving my identity through an e-mail exchange.  And that won’t work right now, because I can only get that e-mail on an iPad that just died.\nHow can I get around this, and more importantly, make it stop happening?\n\nA: Log in to your email somewhere else, then contact Apple.\n", "Q: Why can't I choose to set up Internet Sharing to computers using AirPort? I'm using OSX 10.9. I'm trying to set up Internet Sharing to connect my Android to my Mac directly over Wi-Fi. Every tutorial I've come across (including the one published by Apple) mentions checking a box for \"AirPort\" in a \"To computers using\" list. However, the option is simply not available on my machine:\n\nI have a few related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why isn't the AirPort option available?\n\n*Is there anything I can do to make it available?\n\n*If there isn't, how can I work around it to finish setting up Internet Sharing so I can connect my Android and my Mac directly over Wi-Fi?\n\n\nA: The option is not available because you have selected to share your connection from Wi-Fi.\nYou can't share your connection from Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi. Use an alternative method of obtaining a connection to the internet (e.g. Ethernet) so that the internet connection can be shared over Wi-Fi.\n\nA: Since you don't want to actually share your internet connection but just establish a WiFi link between the Mac and your phone the answer is to create an ad-hoc network.\nTo do this go to the WiFi pizza slice in the menu bar and select \"Create Network...\"\nThis brings up a dialog that allows you to name the network and set the security type. I set the security type to 128-bit WEP, type in 13 characters and then click \"Create\".\nYou will now be able to connect to this network on your phone and you will have a small LAN between the two.\nNote that 128-bit WEP is not terribly secure and can be hacked given time. Change the password frequently and you should be OK but don't rely on it being secure.\n", "Q: MBP security and safety At work, I rely on a public wifi and don't see any good security standards or requirements or tips from Apple. Are there some general tips on first steps to take for securing OS X - if so they would be of great help to me in learning how to secure my Mac.\nWhats the best way to keep my late 2012 MBP safe and secure? \n\nA: Enable the firewall (System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Firewall). Also click on the Advanced settings, and enable \"stealth mode\".  This will help a bit with protecting you on public WiFi networks by not acknowledging ping packets and similar.\nDon't enable any Sharing options (System Preferences > Sharing) unless you're positive you need them. Things like Remote Login and File Sharing are especially dangerous if your passwords are insecure.\nBe wary in general of things you see. If there's a page (fake) that states you have hundreds of viruses that need to be removed, don't believe it. Think before you act basically. Easier said than done, but it's really the best summary of best practices.\nSo many people also forget about the fact that your bank or other important institutions will NEVER ask for personal information via email or for you to \"update settings\". When in doubt, go directly to the relevant institution's site.\n\nA: First, make sure you are using HTTPS in your browser.\nTurn of Sharing\nTurn On Firewall\nNewer use sensitive connections like your bank on a public network.\nHere is one often overlooked:\nMake sure you actually connect to Starbucks wifi while at their store and not connected to a fake wifi server pretending to be Starbuck.\nBasically means knowing who is the provider of the public wifi.\nMake sure no one is looking over your shoulder seen what you typing as a user and passwords.\n\nA: Use a VPN to thwart Man in the middle\n", "Q: Aliases in Alfred: Keyword -> Open a specific folder in finder I would like to define aliases (keywords) in Alfred so that by typing keyboard followed by RET, it opens a pre-specified folder in Finder.\nFor example: p1 could be an alias for \"project_1\" that lives under:\n/Users/josh/code/projects/project_1\n\nso when I open Alfred and type p1, Alfred opens the above path directly in Finder.\nIs this possible with Alfred? How?\n\nA: While it doesn't create a custom Alfred alias/keyword for each item, I've been using the Recent Items workflow for this. It includes an Add to Favorites Finder Action that will add any Finder item (apps, files, folders) to its Favorites section for quick access later. \nHere's the relevant section from the workflow's thread (link above):\n\nKeyword fav: will list your Favorite items. To Add an item to\n  Favorites use Alfred File Action or while browsing any Recent Items\n  category hold fn key and press Return; to remove an item from\n  Favorites, go to Favorites, select the item, hold control key and\n  press Return\n\nAdding Favorites: Finder Actions in Alfred\nIn case you aren't familiar with Alfred's Finder Actions, read about them here. You'll need to purchase PowerPack. The Recent Items workflow will install a new Finder Action called Add to Favorites. In Alfred, press the right arrow key → when any app, folder or file is selected and you'll see the Finder Actions available. Look for the heart icon near the bottom of the list; actioning that will add the current selection to your Favorites. (Click the up arrow ↑ to get to the bottom of the list faster.)\nSaving URLs to Favorites\nSince the workflow is limited to Finder items you'll need to save any web links you want to add to Favorites somewhere in Finder...and keep them there. (Even after adding the Favorite to the Recent Items workflow. If you move or delete the .webloc file it will disappear from Favorites). \nTips on .webloc: \n\n\n*\n\n*Drag the icon to the left of the URL in the browser address bar to a Finder window to create the .webloc file. \n\n*Rename the .webloc file whatever you'd like (its the page title by default). The filename is what's displayed in Favorites, not the URL.\n\n\nAccessing Your Favorites\nNow that you've got some Favorites saved there are a couple of ways to quickly access them:\nOut of the box\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate Alfred \n\n*Type 'rec fa' (for some reason 'f' alone brings up Folders instead of Favorites)\n\n*Press tab ⇥ \n\n*Arrow to your desired Favorite (or type some more to filter the list) and hit return ↩ to launch!\n\n\nAssign a Global Hotkey\n(To eliminate steps 1-3 above!)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Alfred's Preferences (activate Alfred and click the cog or type \"Alfred\")\n\n*Head to the Workflows tab\n\n*Find the Recent Items 3.0 workflow and select it\n\n*The second box down from the upper-right should be a Hotkey step called \"rec Favorites >\" - double-click this box\n\n*Type the hotkey combination you want (mine is ⌃⌥⌘F)\n\n\nHit your hotkey anywhere (Alfred doesn't need to be activated) and your Favorites will be instantly displayed! \n\nA: Yes, you can. There are many ways to achieve the result you want. The easiest method is to create a workflow that contains all the aliases (keywords) that open folders/files in Finder. You must use Alfred 2 for this to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Alfred Preferences and choose Workflows tab.\n\n*Create a new workflow by choosing the plus sign in sidebar. You can name the \nworkflow as Custom Paths/Searces.\n\n*Select the active workflow and select the plus sign at top right. Choose Inputs > Keywords as your trigger. Fill in the keyword you want to use for as aliases. You’ll see one node is created in the workflow main panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new node from Actions > Launch Apps / Files. Drag the folders you wish to launch from Finder into the list.\n\n\n\nYou can create set of folders if you wish. But by far this is the one I prefer because it offers more flexibility than using scripts like Open ~/Desktop via Terminal.\n", "Q: Show thumbnails of AVI and WMV files in finder In OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, I could view thumbnails/previews of .wmv and .avi files in Finder through the software Flip4Mac. However in Mavericks, I cannot see previews although I've installed the newest Flip4Mac (3.2.0.16) software.\nDid something in OS X 10.9 Mavericks change for previewing in finder? Is it possible to get a preview of .avi and .wmv files?\n\nA: Apparently I was a bit trigger-happy with the bounty, because after a bit more Googling, I stumbled upon QLVideo, which:\n\n\"-- allows macOS Finder to display thumbnails, static QuickLook previews, cover art and metadata for most types of video files.\"\n\nThe Github page has an installer (.pkg) under the releases page, but if you have Homebrew installed, you can also use brew install --cask qlvideo on command line (that's what I used — and thumbnails started generating immediately).\nIt even has couple of settings available:\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write uk.org.marginal.qlvideo SnapshotAlways -bool XX\n\n*\n\n*Controls whether QuickLook \"Preview\" shows static snapshot(s) even if\na playable preview is available. Default is NO.\n\n\n\n*defaults write uk.org.marginal.qlvideo SnapshotCount -int XX\n\n*\n\n*Maximum number of\nsnapshots to show in a QuickLook \"Preview\". Default is 10.\n\n\n\n*defaults write uk.org.marginal.qlvideo SnapshotTime -int XX\n\n*\n\n*Time offset in\nseconds for thumbnails and for single snapshots. Unless the video clip\nis shorter than twice this value, in which case the snapshot is taken\nat the mid-point. Default is 60.\n\n*This setting doesn't affect thumbnails that have already been generated - use qlmanage -r cache and re-start Finder to force regeneration of existing thumbnails.\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Adapter for retina macbook pro to external monitor What adapter will provide the best resolution/image quality for extending my late 2013 macbook pro retina display to a 24\" AOC 2436VH monitor? The monitor has HDMI and VGA (d sub). Do I want mini display port to HDMI, or just an HDMI cable or VGA? I will mainly use it for working/writing, not for movies or anything (if it matters). \n\nA: The MacBook Pro retina display already comes with a HDMI. so all you have to do is buy a quality HDMI cable and connect them together. Then MacOSX will recognise the display and then you can use it as a normal display. \n", "Q: Player for long recordings I have recordings which last many hours.\nI want to focus on some points of the recording.\niTunes is not accurate for it.\nIs there something in the settings for iTunes to allow for more precise playback timeline?\nDoes the mini player has a longer time axis. \nI do not know how to customize it at the moment.\nAlternatively What is a good program for playing long audio records when you need to focus on some instance during the recording?\n\nA: You can try the free and open source Audacity sound recorder. \nIt is a powerful recorder, editor, and converter. \nYou can find a version that is backwards compatible with macs running much older versions of OS X. \nIt has a steeper learning curve than QuickTime’s or iTunes audio recording feature, but it is far more powerful and better suited for longer recordings where editing is needed.\nHere is a Sample:\n\n", "Q: Macbook 13\" retina trackpad stuck My trackpad is stuck in the downer position, it doesn't \"click up\" again. I can still use my trackpad for tapping and it functions just like before but I cant click it so it goes down, it is stuck down there. Did anyone else have this problem, if so how did you fix it?  \n(To be clear, this is not the common software issue, this is pure hardware. The trackpad is stuck).\n\nA: In case anyone else is having the same problem out there, this may not be the best solution but it worked for me. \nMy trackpad had been clicking just fine anywhere on it. Suddenly it would only press down in the left bottom corner.\nI simply, closed the laptop,  flipped it over and slapped it hard in corresponding area where the trackpad is. I also lightly tapped it on all sides on a soft surface (my couch). Sure enough that did it. Been fine since for over a year now.\nI guess something must have been stuck underneath it.\n\nA: My first macbook, the normal unibody had this problem too, I fixed it by putting a folded post-it between the battery and the underside of the trackpad.\nAs unmircea says, this is harder to do on a retina but still possible.\nIf you are still under warranty I wouldn't risk it though.\n\nA: early 2013 macbook pro 15\"retina display. Trackpad stopped clicking. High volume compressed air around edges while holding down pad worked after 3 tries. Whew, saved me expense and trip to Apple store.\n\nA: Depending on the year of your laptop, there is actually a screw that dictates the clicking of the trackpad. It's possible the screw has become lose, however, it's an odd shaped screw, and it might be best to take it in to a repair center. It is also possible that your battery has expanded, as the battery sits directly below the trackpad, and it is not allowing your trackpad to click correctly. In either scenario, I would suggest taking it to a repair center/ Apple Store. \n\nA: I have a different solution. I have the late 2013 macbook pro with retina display. My trackpad click is erratic. I could get it click if I pressed on the trackpad thinking that my battery was expanded and inhibiting the trackpad. But this solution was fleeting and not consistent.\nI tried to slip a thin paper in the seam and work it around the trackpad. Some areas are blocked by the device but you can get around the perimeter, even the corners, with a piece of paper. At the office, I found the back sheet on a stack of post-its worked the best.\nI did not recall spilling anything on the trackpad but I did see the paper bring up some dirt. I suspect this is the detritus from everyday use.\nAfter the wipe (and some judicious compressed canned air) the pad is much more responsive. I expect that unless I pull the bottom off and the battery, that gunk is going to hand out there. This may become a regular maintenance routine.\nI just tested it again after typing this message -- and it is still working!\nI tried the tapping and slapping and it only worked sporadically. I didn't want to risk hitting this thing too much. Also, the edges seem to accumulate the debris which gets removed by the paper.\nThe space is very narrow. On my machine it is wider on the left than the right. You can't see the gap on the right but the paper will slide in there. Even around the corners.\nI have gotten into the habit of leaving the air can on my desk to keep all the donut crumbs at bay!\n", "Q: Can I get OS X Dictation to work in Lotus Notes? I really like enhanced (offline) dictation in OS X 10.9, and use it a lot. I'd like to use it within Lotus Notes (9.0.1), but unfortunately double-pressing the \"Fn\" key when I'm composing an email doesn't seem to do anything.\nDo applications have to do something special to support dictation? Is there anything I can do to get additional applications such as Lotus Notes to support dictation?\n\nA: Sadly it doesn't work at this time. I tried looking for a matching SPR but I couldn't find one. \nSo I have created SPR SODY9GMBDH so that development can investigate further. Do not treat this as a final answer though (as someone may have worked around it).\n", "Q: How to backup bookmarks on Safari Before reinstalling OS X, I want to know is it possible to use native capabilities to backup my bookmarks using iCloud, without install some plugins like a Xmarks?  I know manual way to export bookmarks via Safari menu, but this is inconvenient.\n\nA: If you enabled iCloud for Safari in the iCloud settings, your bookmarks are already stored in the Cloud. \n\nA: You could always export your bookmarks into an html file.  I do this from time to time.  Simply go to the File Menu and select \"Export Bookmarks\".   \nUnder the file menu there is also an Import Bookmarks in case your bookmarks were ever lost.\n", "Q: Why does my Mac take a long time (30+ seconds) to find my home wifi? I have a retina MacBook Pro 15\" running Mac OS X 10.9.4. When I wake it from sleep at work, it's connected to the wifi network before I've even entered my password. But at home, with a Airport Extreme base station from about 2009, it takes 30 seconds at minimum every time I wake from sleep, and sometimes up to a couple minutes.\nI've tried rebooting the Airport Extreme, it doesn't need any firmware updates, and of course the laptop itself has been rebooted many times since this problem all started (months ago). I'm sitting in the same room with the thing, so the signal power should be great - not to mention my iOS devices (and other Macs) have no problems connecting instantly to the Airport. So it seems like it's got to be a local computer problem, but then why do I have no problem instantly connecting to other wifi networks?\n\nA: In my professional experience, if you travel a fair amount and use hotel & other free wifi nets, the list of preferred networks can grow unwieldy, and your home network may be way down on the list. @Robuust's suggestion should be amplified to include deleting all preferred networks in that list you may never use again, in addition to any regularly-used networks with connection problems.\nIn addition, I suggest that once you have re-established connection with your home wifi, that you drag it to the top of the list with this option:\n\nNaturally, if it is your only network, this step is superfluous.\nAdditional information edit:\nYou might also want to try deleting the associated login key to this network in Keychain Access.\n\nA: Try setting a manual DHCP (static IP) address:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Network → Wi-Fi → Advanced → TCP/IP.\n\n*Set Configure IPv4 to Using DHCP with manual address.\n\n*Enter your IP address, click OK and Apply the changes.\n\n*Disconnect from your network.\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/V*/A/R*/airport -z\n\n\n*Reconnect to the network using the menu bar item.\n\nA: OS X 10.9.4 fixes a long-standing bug in Mavericks related to wi-fi connections coming out of sleep. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6281?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> Energy Saver and uncheck the 'Wake for Wi-Fi network access' option\nThis fixed the network-not-connecting-after-sleep issue on my brand new MBP 10.9.4, but I wasn't using an Airport Extreme... so maybe that part of the equation is just coincidence in your case.\n\nA: If you don't mind losing all your network settings, you can try a total reset of your network preferences as described here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close System Preferences\n\n*In Finder, go to folder /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\n\n*Delete all network related files, namely: \ncom.apple.airport.preferences.plist\ncom.apple.network.identification.plist\ncom.apple.smb.server.plist\nNetworkInterfaces.plist\npreferences.plist\n\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Go to System Preferences and reconfigure your network settings.\n\n\nI've found this procedure useful for cleaning the mess in network profiles which was left by many subsequent system upgrades.\n", "Q: YouTube at double speed on mobile How do I listen to YouTube videos at double-speed? \nOn the desktop I'm able to change the playback speed to 1.5x or 2x. With podcasts, I'm able to listen to them on my iPhone at 1.5x or 2x speed.

I'm trying to merge all of my text-based notes into Notes.app. My notes are all over the place: some in text files, some in email drafts, etc. I can of course just copy and paste the text of such notes into Notes.app, but then their date created and date modified will be as of the time I copy and paste them in, rather than when I actually made them or modified them, and I'd like to retain the original date data.\nI don't believe there is a way to change this directly in Notes.app, but is there a way to change the dates in the files created by Notes.app? If so, how?\n\nA: I was trying to do the same thing--have original dates for notes that I was moving off my old Samsung phone onto my Mac (which syncs with the iPhone I now use). Both programs display one date--either the created or last modified date. \nThe solution I used: I sent all Samsung memos to my computer (I actually put them in Notes.app, but it doesn't matter where you have them on the computer). Then, what I did is I turned off the Wifi (maybe not necessary?) and went into \"Settings\" > \"Date & Time\", unlocked the lock at the bottom and unchecked \"Set date and time automatically\". Then, I reset the date to the date I wanted displayed on the note in Notes.app, clicked \"Save\" and I made a new note, copying what I had already imported into the computer/Notes.app. It created the note with exactly the date I wanted. :) I repeated the process for the rest of the notes. At the end, I rechecked \"Set date and time automatically\" and restarted the Wifi. \nA solution that works, both clunky and elegant, depending on how you look at it. I am going to do the same for importing my voice memos into iTunes to sync correctly with Voice Memos on my iPhone.\n\nA: At this day, an easy way to create a note in Notes.app for macOS, with specific creation date it's to export a note with Evernote, then edit resulting .enex file, that it's an xml file, search for tag \"created\" and change as you want; then import that .enex file in Notes.app .\nScreenshot of my actual template.enex file:\n\n", "Q: Filezilla Explicit FTP over TLS not working with Airport Extreme There is a security certificate exchange that occurs at the start of the connection process which doesn't seem to work when the Airport Extreme is used as the Internet access point.

Any ideas on what the missing configuration might be? \n\nA: Looks like Airport Extreme acts as an ftp proxy, see https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2047569\nAnd to make use of this proxy for FTPS connections it has either to do SSL man-in-the-middle (which causes certificate check to fail) or to reject the SSL upgrade (e.g. AUTH TLS command).

OSX 10.9.1, Late 2013 MBPr\nI am trying to make a Automator workflow to connect to another machine on my network. How can I do this with Automator? I have it all set up up to the point where I have to enter and admin's name and password, but I can't find a way to simulate keystrokes that actually works.

Apple have just released software updates to fix a rather serious security problem where a valid SSL response wasn't checked properly to ensure it matches the site actually being browsed. I have an iPhone 5, but unfortunately I have a strong personal aversion to the iOS 7 look and feel, so this far I've kept it on iOS 6.1.3.\nOther users have better reasons than I to stay on iOS 6. For example, some people might be reliant on an app that has no iOS 7 version (as per bmike's comment), or the device might not have enough memory for the upgrade (as in this duplicate post).\nApple have released iOS 6.1.6 (\"Available for: iPhone 3GS, iPod touch (4th generation)\"), but my iPhone 5 gives me no option to upgrade to any iOS other than 7.0.6. Similarly, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, iPad 2, [new] iPad (3rd gen), iPad Mini and iPod Touch (5th Gen) all ran lower versions of iOS 6 but do not have builds of iOS 6.1.6 to install. \nMy iPhone is not currently jailbroken, but I would consider doing so in order to avoid having to use the iOS 7 interface. I'd rather not have to choose between the iOS version I prefer and this security patch for SSL. What options are feasible?\n\nA: If your only reason is for patching your OS there is a easy solution, jailbreak your phone, and patch the security flaw patch. \nHow to jailbreak or more information\ni say this because the IPSW released does not exist for your phone, only the 3GS therefor not compatible with your phone. so jailbreaking is your only option!\n\nA: No, you can't install iOS 6.1.6 on an iPhone 5. You can jailbreak and patch iOS 6.1.3 if you don't want to upgrade to iOS 7.0.6. You can't downgrade once you upgrade and you can only upgrade to the newest version released for that device.\n\nA: Sadly, no.\nThe iOS 6.1.6 patch (as was 6.1.5) is an update only available for iPhone 3GS and the fourth generation iPod touch. Apple appears to only be maintaining that branch exclusively for devices which were never compatible with iOS 7. \n\nA: Probably not.\nEven if you wanted to try to patch the OS to make a build from the iPhone 4 build work on iPhone 5 hardware, given that all the devices Apple released iOS 6.0.6 for use the old screen layout, the OS would not be optimized for iPhone 5 screen. \nThere would be significant engineering effort to back patch all those assets to make the patched OS compatible with the bigger screen on an iPhone 5.\n\nA: If you're not willing or able to Jailbreak your device and only going to use the services Apple uses there is no way you can install a previous version of iOS.\nApple only supports the use of the latest iOS as this is the most secure and best working version around. When a major version is launched (e.g. iOS 6 to 7) iOS 6 will be available for a short period and a downgrade is possible for a few days after. This period has expired for iOS7 to iOS6.\nSidenote: iOS 6.1.6 is only available for iPhone 3GS (and iPod Touch 4), so you can never install it on an iPhone 5.\n\nA: No it is not possible.\nThe reason:\nThese software packages are compiled for each phone individually (since they feature different hardware), and Apple has not complied one for the iPhone 5.\nTherefor only Apple (or, in theory anyone else that has the source code) could create a software update for your phone.\n", "Q: Some of my text contacts appear in red on Ipad/wont send Have a new iPad Air.  \nWhen I try to send a text, some of the contacts come up in red instead of blue and I cannot send a text message.  \nAny ideas?\n\nA: This happens when the person you are contacting is not registered with iMessage. Because your iPad is not connected to your phone policy (just data if anything), you are not able to text regular numbers. Your iPad is still a tablet, and so it cannot send regular SMS messages outside of iMessage, which is Apple's, not Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/Sprint's.\n", "Q: Time Capsule showing backups date in pink I have tried a lot of net to find, why does time machine shows pink icons of the date.

But yesterday i needed some backup and found out for last 2 months, every date in pink. Why is that? How can i assure that every backup of mine is backup which i can rely on?, and not pink.\n\nA: *\n\n*Local snapshots (stored on your internal drive) are white.\n\n*Backups stored on your Time Machine disk are pink.\n\nThe pink backups are correct as they are your real backups. Local snapshots are meant as temporary, intermediate backups and will be deleted automatically.\n\nLocal Snapshots appear in the \"Star Wars\" display much like normal Time Machine backups.  The main difference is they're shown in white/gray in the Timeline, not the purple of a Time Machine backup on an external volume.\nLike normal Time Machine backups, Local Snapshots are usually made hourly.   If your Time Machine volume is available, both are usually done at the same time, so you'll see adjacent purple and white tick marks with the same time.  If the Time Machine volume isn't available, Local snapshots will continue on the same schedule, so for that period you'll only see white ones.\nAlso, the \"contextual menu\" you get on Local Snapshots doesn't allow deleting a Snapshot, or all Snapshots of selected items, as on normal backups.\n\n", "Q: Can't see the image or movie file dimensions in Finder I can't see the image or movie file dimensions in the Finder when browsing files on a server.

You will get a local IP address through which your Mac can access your iPhone photos library.\n\n*Browse through your iPhone photo library from your Mac browser\nOpen the web browser on your Mac, type the above IP address in the address bar of your web browser on the Mac. It could be Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or any other web browsers you have. Press Enter on the keyboard, all photos and albums from this iPhone’s photo library will be listed on the Photo Wireless Transfer interface right on your Mac browser.\nAfter the Wi-Fi connection between your iPhone and Mac established, you can use the web browser on the Mac to browse through photo library and albums on iPhone. Open the target photo album, you will find all photos listed as thumbnails.\n\n*Transfer photos from iPhone to Mac\nNow it’s time to pick up the photos from iPhone photo library and transfer to Mac over Wi-Fi. You can click the ‘preview’ to enlarge the photos; you can click ‘Download original’ to download pictures one by one; you can also select multiple photos or all photos in the album and download them as a compressed zip file.

The MacBook detects it fine (understands that it's is a HP 23fi) and I can see stuff on the screen. \nNow, the problems start. I want the laptop retina screen to be turned off and the external HP monitor to be driver at 1920x1080 (60.0 Hz). If both the laptops are plugged in, I can simply change the input terminal on the monitor and use them both conveniently. With Debian, I run this on the terminal and everything works fine. \nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1920x1080\n\nwhich basically tells the external monitor (VGA1) to run at 1920x1080. After that, I usually run\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --off\n\nwhich shuts off my laptop screen. \nI want to do something like this with the mac but have hit some problems. I can set the built-in retina display to say \"Best for HP 23fi\" under system preferences. With the HP23fi, I set \"Resolution\" to \"Best for HP 23fi\", Rotation to \"standard\" , Refresh rate to \"60 Hz (NTSC)\" and underscan to \"more\" (without which, I can't see the entire screen). \nThis \"works\" but the fonts on the screen are blurry and I can't really use anything. I'm not familiar with how the retina display affects things but I'd like the external monitor to be driven at top resolution and get output similar what I'm getting with the Debian laptop. How exactly do I do this? \nThere might be bits of relevant information I'm missing since I'm not familiar with the platform.\n\nA: I just bought one and had the same problem - blurry fonts on 2014 RMBP & had to adjust the underscan to fit the image on the screen.\nFixed by\n\n\n*\n\n*turning off Overscan in the monitor menu Image Control > Custom Scaling > Overscan > Off and\n\n*turning off Underscan in the System Preferences > Display menu.\n\n", "Q: Is there any podcast App that allows to listen to episodes chronologically, starting at episode 1? I can not figure out what's the correct settings to be able to listen to podcast episodes from day 1, in the chronologically order, automatically.\nLet's say that I've just discovered an interesting podcast.

You will end up with all episodes\nIf syncing from iTunes you should be able to choose the x oldest podcasts in iTunes settings but the syncing is unreliable\n\nA: Unfortunately, I do not believe there is such a setting, and that the only way to do this is to do as you are currently, adding them manually. You may consider seeing if you can write an Automator script to do this for you though.\n", "Q: Disconnect BT device on iOS 7 How can I disconnect one single Bluetooth device from iOS?\nBackground: I usually use my BT headphones with my iPhone, but sometimes I'd like to use the headphones with my computer. I have BT turned on on iPhone also for my Pebbles SmartWatch, therefore I don't want just turn the BT off on iPhone\n\nA: If you don't want to unpair the device, but just want to disconnect from it, Apple have 3 methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn the device off and hope it doesn't reconnect back to your iOS device when you turn it back on again.\n\n*Turn Bluetooth off on your iOS device, you obviously don't need to stay connected to more than one Bluetooth device.\n\n*A very natural and simple process Apple have thought about carefully is that you simply walk your iOS device away from the device, about 5-20 metres, until it is out of range. You don't even need to unlock you iOS device to perform this step! Once out of range your iOS device will disconnect and you can walk safely back into range again.\nI hope this helps, Apple have clearly thought these processes through and have delivered easy to understand and intuitive methods for disconnecting iOS from your Bluetooth device.\n\nA: You cannot just disconnect it easily, below the way to unpair your device. You can't disconnect them unfortunately! I've got the same issue with my Plantronics Go 2.\nOn your iOS device go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*Bluetooth\n\n*Devices\n\n*Click the blue (i) button and remove the device. \n\n\nYou can remove(unpair) a device.\n", "Q: \"Cut the Rope\" game and used space Just recently noticed that \"Cut the Rope\" free versions on my iPad Mini with latest iOS is taking up to 500MB of space. Is it really necessary for them to take up so much space?

Don't trust apps that claim they can save you space - they generally end up breaking things!\n", "Q: Does iOS 5 have a SSL security bug that got patched on iOS 6/7? Apple released iOS 7.0.6 and 6.1.6 to patch a specific SSL/TLS security bug. \nI can't find anything official about iOS 5. Does iOS 5 have the same bug?\nPlease cite your answer. \n\nA: Same manual test with gotofail.com\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS 4.1 = Safe\n\n*iOS 5.1.1 = Safe\n\n*iOS 6.1.3 = Vulnerable\n\n*iOS 7.0.4 + (SSLPatch) = Safe :)\n\n\nAccording to SSLPatch you are vulnerable from iOS 6.0 to iOS 6.1.5 and from iOS 7.0 to iOS 7.0.5.\n\nA: You can visit gotofail.com from Safari in iOS 5 and check yourself.\n\nA: Jeffrey Grossman (@Jeffrey903) found that the bug came in with iOS 6, which means that iOS 5 and earlier builds are not affected:\n\nI have confirmed that the SSL vulnerability was introduced in iOS 6.0. It is not present in 5.1.1 and is in 6.0 (22 Feb 2014 at 5:11 PM)\n\nHe tested for the bug on a variety of earlier devices and versions:\n\nNot sure about 7.1 (device at office). So far I’ve tested 2.2, 2.2.1, 3.0, 3.1.3, 4.3.5, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.1.3, 7.0.4, 7.0.6 (22 Feb 2014 at 5:13 PM)\nI tested the iOS SSL vulnerability using http://gotofail.com  on these 16 devices.  (22 Feb 2014 at 6:36PM)\n\nI don’t know if he was the first to spot it, but I’m willing to trust his testing.\n\nA: ZDNet says :\n\niOS 5 and Mac OS X 10.8 never had the bug\n\n", "Q: How do I force iOS to check for updates? I've got an iPad2 that's supposedly susceptible to the latest encryption hole in iOS 7.  However, it's not offering me the update automatically.  Where can I go to force it to check for updates?\n\nA: To check for it manually, go to Settings -> General -> Software Update.\nYour device will then check with Apple's servers and let you update if there is newer software available, otherwise it will show you the current version and tell you that you're already up to date.\n\nA: The update are pushed over the air (OTA) by Apple. There's not much you can do except checking yourself when you know there is an update since the push notification servers have to churn through lists of all the devices they think are needing the update and might have to retry a few times if your device doesn't receive the first message notifying it of a new update.\n\nA: It's often the case that Apple don't roll out each update to every device in every country at the same time. You may find that it takes a few hours (or even days) to appear as available on some devices. I would suggest trying to update via iTunes which usually allows you to install updates immediately.\nimore.com usually has up to date information on releases.\n\nA: My iPad 2 had an earlier update downloaded that I'd never installed (7.0.4) and Settings -> General -> Software Update didn't offer 7.0.6.\nI powered down and booted up, then it downloaded the latest and let me update.\n", "Q: \"Vintage\" Apple stickers Cleaning out my mother's basement, I found a \"sticker album\" that I kept as a child in the early 80s. A few pages of my sticker album contain these stickers -- maybe 12 in all -- all still attached to their backing and probably still \"stickable\":\n \nUnfortunately, I don't remember where or when I got them.  \nI found it particularly unusual that the bottom \"stripe\" was so offset from the upper part of the apple and I'm not sure if that is a misprint or a deliberate evolution of the logo.  \nCan anyone tell me about these stickers and when they might have been released? It might have been before the Mac came out, but the same sticker album also contained a \"Where's the Beef?\" sticker which was the famous Wendy's ad campaign in 1984, the same year the Mac was released.\nDo they have any value beyond nostalgia and hipsterism?  \n\nA: You're looking at the very first stickers and logos introduced by Apple Inc. when the Apple II was shipped in 1977.\nThe font-face used here is called Motter Tektura and the WikiPedia info can be found here.\nThe logo itself is not a misprint, but as you can see on this image can be removed from the foil with a result a nice Apple (which is still used by Apple).\nps. can I have one? :-)\n", "Q: Removed Cloak leaves strange patterns on screen \nHey there..i downloaded a software called \"cloak\" it lets you change the colors of your mac system .. when i changed the color it got wrong .. i tried to choose the original color but it didnt work, then i deleted the software and restart my mac but it still there.. i also tried to restore the system but i didnt set up the time machine is there any other way?\n\nA: I went browsing in the installer package, and it looks like Cloak does some serious meddling in system frameworks.  For example, there's a lightpurple.scpt that does (among other things):\nsudo mv /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/SArtFile.bin /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/SArtFileold.bin\nsudo cp /Themes/LightPurple.cloak /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/SArtFile.bin\n\nThese are not changes that will reliably work as the OS gets updated.\nYou could do a search across the OS to find *.old.* files, but I would recommend simply reinstalling OS X.  You can reinstall the OS on top of your current system, which will replace the system files but leave your user files alone.\n\nA: Without downloading and playing with it this is my best advice...\nStep one, see if it persists in another user account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Users & Groups (or Accounts if older than 10.7)\n\n*Click on the lock in the lower left corner and enter your administrator password\n\n*Click on Guest User and check the box to \"Allow guests to log in to this computer\"\n\n*Log out of your user ( > Log Out YourName)\n\n*Click on the Guest user (or enter Guest in name field) at the login screen\n\n\nStep two, depending on the results of step one I would try to locate and remove it's preference file:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the Guest user account seemed to be ok, go to the Library folder in your user account by clicking on the Go menu while holding option and choose Library.  If the Guest user account looked the same as your regular account then go to the main Library folder at Macintosh HD/Library.\n\n*Scroll down and open the Preferences folder\n\n*Locate the file that has the developers or applications name in it.  I would look for something along the lines of com.Cloak.plist or com.Flip.plist, since the developer is Flip Conversion Design.\n\n*Once you've found the file drag it to the trash and immediately reboot your Mac ( > Reboot)\n\n\nHopefully that does the trick for you.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s dropped-now the screen is black My daughter dropped her iPhone 4s (ios version 6) and now the screen is black (this was only four weeks after I replaced a cracked screen myself on this same unit and everything was working fine). She said it first landed from waist height on the top edge of the unit. Even though the screen is black, calls still come in (but I can't seem to answer them despite my swiping the screen area to answer), texts come in, the vibrate feature works, music was playing for a while and then I touched the screen where I thought the play/pause button would be and it the music stopped.  When I hold the power button down to shut down the unit, I swipe where I think the \"slide to power off\" message on the upper screen area would be and in fact the unit powers off, so this tells me the digitizer is working at least in that area of the screen.  I removed the back cover with the power on and when I hit the power button, I could see the edges of the back of the screen light up even though the screen was still black, so this tells me that some kind of power is making it to the screen. I then powered down the unit and re-seated all the connections to the logic board; it didn't help.  \nI read somewhere that restoring the unit to factory settings may work.  She never backed up the iPhone to an iTunes account on our PC but did use iCloud backup.  When I attempted to backup the iPhone to the PC iTunes account it required me to unlock the iPhone and every attempt I've made to \"blindly\" swipe and enter in the passcode has not worked. I didn't even get a vibration indicating the wrong passcode was entered.\nIf I restore the iPhone to factory settings, I read that it will update to ios 7. I've read and been told by many people that ios 7 is not optimized for the iPhone 4s and that it's a bad move to upgrade and best to stay with ios 6.\nI'm hoping for some help here in (1) what may be causing the black screen and (2) will restoring the iPhone to factory settings work and if so, is there a way to restore the iPhone, given my situation, without upgrading to ios 7?\n\nA: It sounds as if it may be a simple case of the cable connecting the screen coming loose - the fact that the digitizer works could indicate that the cable isn't seated correctly - i.e. some of the connections are being made but not all of them. You say that you replaced the screen yourself, so I assume you're fairly competent at taking it apart again... If so, try doing this, removing the cable connecting the screen, and then reseating it.\nAlternatively, it could be that the impact has broken the part of the screen required to display things, in which case, I'm afraid you're looking at replacing it again!\n\nA: open your iPhone and you see blue line and press it for a long time and go to ifun box or iTunes and scan.\n", "Q: Why localhost works even apache is off?

I've tried to start from another drive, but I am not sure I have a proper back up.  That resulted in a screen with a reset arrow and an arrow pointed to the right.\nI have not tried to blow out dust yet, but I'm wondering if my start up drive is shot.  If so, will replacing it help? And what drive should I replace it with?\nUpon running a diagnostics (when I could) this error resulted.\n2STF /8/3: A upper\n\n\nA: More than likely the hard drive in the upper bay is failing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Failing hard drives often make loud clicking sounds.  It's not as common, but is far from uncommon to hear beep error tones from failing hard drives as well.\n\n*The gray screen with an flashing folder icon occurs when the Mac cannot find a valid OS X system to boot to.  This can be a result of a badly corrupted operating system (often resulting from impending hard drive failure), a failed hard drive or a new unformatted hard drive.\n\n*The AHT error code more than likely stands for SATA Function or something similar, and since it references \"upper\" I would interpret that as the upper of two items.  Depending on your G5 PowerMac you might have dual processors but these are usually referred to as A or B and would throw a CPU error rather than STF.  Since there are two drive bays, where the two SATA disks are aligned vertically, I would interpret the error as meaning the upper disk is having the problem.\n\nTo diagnose the issue you could try this...\n\n\n*\n\n*Power your Mac on while holding command+V (Apple + V if an older keyboard).\n\n*Assuming the disk isn't completely failed this should boot the Mac in verbose mode, where you can read what is occurring as the Mac is attempting to boot.\n\n*I would be on the lookout for \"Disk I/O\" errors, these will indicate a hardware failure with the hard drive itself.  If the Mac doesn't boot to verbose mode and instead only shows the flashing folder icon again then I would again assume a hardware failure.  With AHT (the diagnostic you ran) already reporting an error this is likely the scenario.\n\nMore than likely replacing the startup disk WILL fix the issue.  Most any 3.5\" SATA disk will work although I would keep it relatively small (less than 250GB) as some of the earlier PowerMac G5s had firmware limitations on hard drive capacity.  You will need to partition/format the disk using \"Apple Partition Map\" and re-install Mac OS X.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: iTunes - Remove? I am using mavericks.

There are some open source options available but you'll likely need to purchase a dedicated router/hotspot.\nAnother option would be to use Bluetooth/iBeacons - a lot of people leave it switched on so they can easily connect with speakers/car kits etc, and there's a lot of options available - a quick Google for \"Bluetooth push advertising\" or \"iBeacon\" should help.

Rather than hard coding all the VMs to use an IP that my Wifi router uses, Id rather have something that works even while WIFI is down.\nHow can I have network communication between my VM and my mac while disconnected from all other networks? (wifi, lan, etc)  I\n\nA: If you are using Shared Networking for your Parallels VM, there is an IP address allocated for the host OSX machine as well as the VM. By default, shared machines use the 10.211.55.x subnet, and 10.211.55.2 is the host. You can use this IP to access the OSX host from your Windows VM. This subnet can be adjusted in Parallels Preferences:\n\nIf you check the box Show in System Preferences, you will see the host IP:\n\nShared networking is independent of the LAN that the host machine uses, so it can be used while disconnected from a network.\nAn additional networking type is Host-Only, which  will work similarly, though with a different subnet: 10.37.129.x. By default, host-only disallows connectivity from your VM to the external network.\nThe 3rd networking type is Bridged, which will use your network adapter (ethernet or WiFi) directly, so this networking type will not work for the setup you are asking for.\nFor reference - here is a description of the networking modes that Parallels uses.\n", "Q: Can't generate a Reflow project from photoshop CC According to this video importing a psd from Photoshop CC to Reflow is as simple as going to the menu File > Generate and clic Edge Reflow Project. \nBut this menu item is not showing in my case.\nI'm using a Mac OSX 10.8.5, the 30 days trial of creative cloud for the moment with both Reflow and Photoshop CC installed and up to date.

Only if I launch it manually.\n\nA: Short question, many solutions\nThe easy way\nUsing the Terminal, unregister all the links from you file types to iTunes    /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -u /Applications/iTunes.app\nIf you still have trouble and iTunes opens automatically, check out RCDefaultApp. Old, but still working (right click->open...)\nhttp://www.rubicode.com/Software/Bundles.html#RCDefaultApp\nInstall, go to system preferences, disable all the \"media\" links to iTunes\n\"Quick and dirty\" (Teminal)\nFirst, do \nsudo chown -R $USER /Applications/iTunes.app\nchmod ugo-x /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS\n\nThis will prevent iTunes from starting EVER.\nTo start iTunes manually, do\nchmod ugo+x /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes; open /Applications/iTunes.app; chmod ugo-x /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes\n\nThe way for the brave\nUse duti, http://duti.org/documentation.html. Install using \"brew install duti\", make sure to have homebrew installed first (http://brew.sh). \nRemove all links to iTunes.\nMake sure to read Change file association in terminal? to get all current file types.\n\nA: I have the same problem with my MacBookPro. It is definitely lined to UE Boom. Everytime UE Boom makes a Bluetooth connection, iTunes starts. Logitech support was not help.\n\nA: You didn't indicate if you had checked the Open at Login option in the iTunes Dock icon:\n\n\nA: Enable root and remove iTunes.app (like any other directory) permanently, period. That's what I did, and I have 0 regrets.\n# rm -rf iTunes.app\n\n\nA: I've fixed it.  I had implemented all the fixes for this issue that I had found on so many web sites that I was feeling like I'd lucked out.\nTurns out that I had a screen saver installed called SoundStream.  An audio sensitive screen saver.  When this launches after the preset amount of time if iTunes isn't running, it starts it up!\nSo, if you're having this issue of iTunes starting randomly it may well be your screen saver doing this silently in the background!\n", "Q: Fastest way to get picture from iOS camera to desktop \"file upload\" dialog? When I'm on OS X and on a website see a [File upload] button, half the time what I want to upload is a picture, which I would like to take right then on iOS camera. Currently this means doing the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*click [file upload] button\n\n*open up iPod\n\n*go to camera app\n\n*snap the picture\n\n*connect iPod to Mac with USB cable\n\n*open iPhoto\n\n*import the picture\n\n*click on the imported picture\n\n*choose \"show in finder\"\n\n*drag the image from finder to the file upload dialog\n\n\nIs there some way I could just somehow upload from iOS camera directly? So that it would go something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*click [file upload] button\n\n*choose \"upload from iOS camera\"\n\n*open up iPod\n\n*go to camera app (or even have it start automagically)\n\n*click \"snap & send to Mac open dialog\"\n\n\nA: *\n\n*If you enabled photo stream on iPhone and have iPhoto/Aperture on your mac, you can try enabling photo stream on mac. If you didn't install iPhoto/Aperture,  maybe you can try MyPhotoStream.\n\n*I strongly recommend flick., which is really easy to use and covered all platforms. It's free and cool!\n\n*Share to iMessage and send to yourself after taking the photo if your iMessage on iPhone is synced with mac.\n\n\n\nthe geeky way: If your iPad has been jailbreaked, try sshfs in Mac's homebrew. Assume that you have installed homebrew and got root privilege of iPad. Just type \n\nbrew install sshfs\n\nin Mac's terminal, and then\n\nmkdir /Volumes/iPad  && ln -s /Volumes/iPad ~/Documents/iPad && sshfs root@youripad:/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/100APPLE /Volumes/iPad\n\n(I tried to directly mkdir in Documents and mount iPad's photo directory there but failed. It just didn't appear in the open_file_dialog.)\nLast, just choose the photos you want from the open_file_dialog->Documents->iPad. \nIf you want to unmount your iPad from mac, type\n\numount /Volumes/iPad\n\nin your terminal.\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: How do I rotate the pictures of my iPhone/iPad wallpaper every few minutes? I want the wallpaper on my iPhone/iPad to rotate/change to a new wallpaper every few minutes, so that I won't get bored seeing the same picture over and over again every time I'm on my phone. \nAre there any free iPhone apps which allow me to do so?\n\nA: There are lots of ways to do this.  First Jailbreak your iDevice.  Then once your device is jailbroken look up winterboard.  install winterboard and find tweak option for changing wallpapers.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I don't think it's possible to change the wallpaper at a set amount of time. It has to be done manually. \nI'm pretty sure this is to save battery life. \n\nA: It is not possible. You will have to do it manually.\n", "Q: Can't find Skype photos captured on Skype on my MacBook Air I have OS X 10.9.1. I captured a photo using Skype (skype 6.12) and I cannot find the folder holding my images.\nI've tried looking for the answer on this website but couldn't find it.\n\nA: OK, I did the search and found it in most peculiar place one can think of.\nThis is on my MBA with 10.9.2.\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ImageKit.RecentPictureService/Data/Library/Images/Recent Pictures\n\nYou will find two types of image files there -- TIFF (thumbnail) and standard .png\nThe .tiff are converted by Skype to a profile pictures, the .png are the originals.\nExtra information:\nIf you need frequent access to that folder but do not want to remember its complicated location\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the folder (Recent Pictures)\n\n*Click on Make Alias\n\n*Drag the Alias folder to your desktop (you can rename it to what you like)\n\nA: Yes worked for me to but found there were more steps that listed above\n\n\n*\n\n*find your \"library\" folder by hitting the option key and clicking “Go” at top icons  (this will make your \"library\" folder appear in the choices\n\n*click on \"library\"\n\n*click on \"Containers\"\n\n*click on \"Com.appleImagekit.recentpictureservice\"\n\n*click on \"Data\"\n\n*click on \"Library\"\n\n*click on \"Images\"\n\n*click on \"Recent pictures\"\n\n\nA: I found the contacts pictures in ~/Library/Caches/com.skype.skype/**SkypeUsername**/SKAvatarCache\nThe filetype is TIFF:\n$ file 26BB98C5-E100-41F3-B4FC-13494BAC450A-34407-000040EB90E8B8C7 \n26BB98C5-E100-41F3-B4FC-13494BAC450A-34407-000040EB90E8B8C7: TIFF image data,\nbig-endian, direntries=13, height=256, bps=3, compression=none,\nPhotometricIntepretation=RGB, orientation=upper-left, width=256\n\n", "Q: Convert HTML to PDF with page margins and hyperlinks Unfortunately, it would appear that Safari doesn't support CSS2 page margins from CSS2 recommendation circa 1998, whereas all other major browsers now do.\nHowever, when printing out an HTML page, it would seem like it is only Safari (or at least some versions of it on some systems) that preserves the hyperlinks into the PDF document, whereas all other browsers (SeaMonkey, Firefox, Google Chrome) only preserve the decoration.\nIs there any way to print a rather complex HTML document into PDF without losing the hyperlinks, but ensuring narrow margins?\nThere's a related question, but it's simply after the hyperlinks, without any regards to the page margins — Print HTML to PDF while retaining hyperlinks.\n\nA: Try using wkpdf:\nsudo gem install wkpdf;wkpdf -s file.html -m 10 file.pdf\n\nIt retains links and you can specify margin sizes with -m.\n", "Q: GPU Panic: Kernel panic when performing graphically intense tasks I have been experiencing kernel panics roughly once per day since upgrading to Mavericks, but they overwhelmingly occur while I am doing something graphically intensive (eg: switching desktops, using Google Earth software).

It never really worked, (it would freeze all the time, the WiFi would cut in and out, etc.) so I got rid of it. I tried to do this through Bootcamp again, but for whatever reason this didn't work, so I booted up on a live Ubuntu USB and manually erased the NTFS partition for Windows.\nOnce back in OS X (Mavericks, but it was Mountain Lion when I installed Windows), I expended the default HFS+ partition to fill the full space of the SSD. So now I've got a nearly out-of-box Macintosh HD partition; everything on the Mac side works fine.\nBut lately, I find myself getting increasingly annoyed at the BSD coreutils among other things, and so I'd like to be able to dual boot into some version of Linux (probably Ubuntu or Xubuntu, but this is kind of arbitrary). \nMy Issue\nSo but it turns out that when I \"uninstalled\" the Windows partition, something didn't quite update in the boot loader (I'm kind of fuzzy on my knowledge of the difference between a boot loader and a boot manager, so I might be using these terms incorrectly). When I start up my Mac holding down option, I get the following...\n\nwhich is weird because this is what my main hard drive looks like in Disk Utility\n\nand again with gpt:\n$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6\n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  489562928      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  489972568     262151\n  490234719         32         Sec GPT table\n  490234751          1         Sec GPT header\n\nTo Be Fixed\nI can't see where these icons would be coming from. In the end, I'd like to just have both of these gone (and I guess any other hidden remnants of Windows that they might be indicating).\n\nA: When you don't use the Boot Camp utility to remove Windows, the Windows boot image on your EFI partition is not removed. This is what you see when you hold down ⌥ during boot.\nThe procedure to solve this is not for the faint of heart. You need to mount the EFI partition in OS X (normally, it only gets mounted for system updates).\nMounting the EFI partition\nList the partitions on your Mac:\ndiskutil list\n\nYou should see something like this:\n/dev/disk0\n #: TYPE                     NAME          SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n 0: GUID_partition_scheme                  *251.0 GB  disk0\n 1: EFI                                    209.7 MB   disk0s1\n 2: Apple_HFS                Macintosh HD  250.1 GB   disk0s2\n 3: Apple_Boot               Recovery HD   650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\nTake note of /dev/disk0 and 1: EFI. The numbers 0 and 1 have significance later.\nNow mount the EFI partition (replace the numbers 0 and 1 if they are different in your output):\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/efi\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/efi\n\nRemove the Windows boot image\nNow navigate to /Volumes/efi/EFI. This directory is supposed to only contain an APPLE directory. On a machine where I had Windows installed, it also contained a Microsoft and Boot directory. These can be safely removed, but for extra safety I would recommend renaming them to something different instead.\nThen umount and delete the directory you created earlier.\nsudo umount /Volumes/efi\nsudo rmdir /Volumes/efi\n\n\nA: Reinstall Windows again using BootCamp, then remove it properly using BootCamp Assistant. It takes time, but solves the problem. Dummy Windows entries are gone forever.\n\nA: Deleting the Windows EFI Boot Entry\n\nThis is the most accurate and I have succeeded!\n\nFirst, you’ll need to locate the EFI partition, which is where your Mac stores information about what operating systems can be booted from your Mac. In the Terminal, type this command:\ndiskutil list\n\nYou’re looking for a partition on your main hard drive called EFI.\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         500.1 GB   disk0s2\n\nOnce you find it, enter these commands one at a time:\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/EFI\n\nNext typing:\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/EFI\n\nReplace /dev/disk0s1 with the correct partition you located using diskutil.\nTyping Terminal:\ncd /Volumes/EFI/EFI\n\nContinue typing Terminal:\nls\n\nAt this point the list may appear as Apple, Boot, Microsoft.\nDelete the Windows EFI Boot entry by typing this into the Terminal:\n rm -rf Microsoft\n rm -rf Boot\n\nAnd unmount EFI, typing Terminal:\nsudo umount /Volumes/efi\n\nMacOS High Sierra can type is:\nsudo diskutil umount /Volumes/efi\n\nRestart your MAC and done!!!!\n\nA: In the end, I gave up on actually removing the entries from wherever they're stored on the bootloader. Instead, I just installed rEFInd and manually removed the entries from the bootloader. I chose to go this route because after installing Xubuntu, this was the only way that my mac could find the xubuntu bootup file and also rEFInd has a feature where you can specify which entries you want to display and which you don't. \nIt's not entirely fixed, but I'll only have the laptop for a little while longer, and I can deal with it until then. Worse things have happened.\n", "Q: I cannot change Game Centre Profile name When I first put in my nickname I used emoji with the name. now each time I try to sign in to change the name a box comes up saying to update my account cannot connect to server. As far as I know my account is updated. However the emoji keyboard no longer is available when I sign in. How do I fix this?\n\nA: To log in to Game Center, you use your Apple ID email and password, not your Game Center nickname.

If I submit multiple apps to be reviewed at once, is it possible for them to all be reviewed at the same time or do they go down the list and review the next one only after the one before it has been reviewed?\n\nA: My guess is if you put 10 or 30 apps in for review, you might [and probably should] have a hold or slowdown, but for only two apps, I doubt there is any meaningful delay by having more than one app in the queue. \nSee the published app submission guide on Apple's developer web site. It also mattes if you are submitting an update as opposed to initial submission of an app for initial review and first sale. \n\nA: For the purposes of review, both apps are completely independent, as if they had been uploaded by two different accounts.\nDifferent people can review the different apps, but basically you don't need to worry about uploading two apps — Apple takes care of it all for you.\n", "Q: Automatically assign DNS How do I ensure that the DNS is being set by the network?\nOn Windows I would check here and make sure that Obtain DNS server address automatically was selected:\n\n\nA: Open System Preferences and click the Network icon.\n\nSelect your network in the list on the left, and make sure that it says \"Using DHCP\" in the drop-down list after \"Configure IPv4:\"\n\nIf you've made any changes, click the \"Apply\" button and then the \"Show All\" button to make sure everything is saved.\n", "Q: How to get rid of iCloud music on iPhone I have an iPhone 4s with iOS7 and somehow I see iCloud music which I haven't downloaded yet on my iOS device.\nHow can I get rid of these, I do not need to see them.\n\nA: You might also have videos visible in the Video.app. You can remove them following the summary below.\nIf you go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*iTunes and App Store\n\n*Uncheck Show All Music (and videos)\n\n*Done, they’re gone!\n\n", "Q: Mac Calendar add shared calendar for email account with 2 letter email address One of the meeting rooms at our new offices has a short email address (tv@ourdomain.com).\nThe calendar sharing function only works on a search for email addresses (I can't type in an address manually) but the search only starts after the 3rd character before the @ symbol (and stops after the @ symbol).\nIs there any way around this?

Over the past 6 months every few weeks they glitch. What happens is that at exactly midnight eastern time all three phones start showing the lock screen for two seconds, followed by a second of a black screen, followed by five seconds of the Apple logo on a white background. During this time the phone is running. When on the lock screen you can actually swipe left and start entering your unlock code, but you will get interrupted. This usually goes on for at least 6 hours. Hard resetting the phone does not fix it: you just boot to the same state. Restoring from a backup does fix it and seems to be the recommended solution on the Apple forums.\nIf I do not do a restore from backup, the problem resolves itself usually by around 10am.\nThis happened with all iOS 7 updates including the 7.0.4. \nThis is a huge problem. First, it lights up the whole room and drains the battery. If not on the charger, the phone will die and our alarms will not go off. If on the charger, the phone will keep buzzing like you just plugged it in. BTW, we use standard Apple cables and chargers. Restoring from backup takes a long time and I do not wish to do that for three phones in the middle of the night. There are of course other inconveniences, like not being able to dial 911.\nSomeone please tell me I am not alone in having this issue. It seems like a huge bug in iOS and in just a bit I am going to try to call Apple to see if I can figure out how to report it. In the meantime, I'd just like to see if the three iPhones in my house are the only ones that are experiencing this or if this is widespread.\nEdit: Turns out an iPad Air we have also had the same problem. The only iOS device that did not is a third generation iPad.\nEdit 2: Just called Apple. Their senior support person has never heard of this issue, so they are escalating to the development team. We'll see what they say...\nEdit 3: Have not experienced the same issue but never heard back from Apple. Seems like the 7.1 update helped. If anyone else is still experiencing this issue, please respond.\n\nA: I had this exact same problem. It has to do with recurring calendar events. This mainly occurs when the phone is syncing with Microsoft Exchange, but may occur in other circumstances. You need to find any recurring calendar events and simply delete them. Adding an end date will not fix the problem. It took me about a month of looking through device logs to figure this out.\n\nA: I have a solution for you check my video :https://youtu.be/XVLmDV_Kchc\n", "Q: Calendar.app stuck on iCloud sync My dad1 recently switched to Mavericks.

In the past when I have exported to PDF from Mou.app, the final PDF maintains the vector logo. Today when I tried, it now turns the vector logo into a bitmap, which makes the new PDF look really poor and ruins any prints that are made from it.\nI don't think Mou.app is at fault as it hasn't been updated for a while and I was successfully making vector logo PDFs after Sept, 2013. Also, I get the same problem in Marked.app. This is why I suspect OS X Mavericks. Any thoughts?\n\nA: I found a fix of sorts. Using a high resolution TIFF in place of the PDF logo improved the final PDF quality. Tried high-res PNGs, but the results weren't as good as a TIFF.\n", "Q: Why am I notified about some missed calls via a text from +8888?

I'd like to be able to get the contents of Finder's \"Network\" folder (Menubar-->Go-->Network). The folder contents here is different than /Network or /net.\nThe overall goal is to grep the names in this folder for a specific (unmanaged...) Mac in my environment. I don't know where it is, I just have the local host name. I was thinking about deploying a script to run dns-sd, but that binary is not too friendly to BASH script. Which is why I'm looking into Applescript now.  \n\nA: It appears that the Network Finder window isn't a folder. Attempting to get the location of Network gives the following error:\nCan’t make «class cfol» \"\" of application \"Finder\" into type alias. (-1700)\n\n…and attempting to get the location of the containing folder gives:\nNo result was returned from some part of this expression.

Unfortunately, this means the typical shortcut I use for screenshots (⌘+SHIFT+4) causes the element to disappear.\nIs there any way I can capture this tooltip, preferably without installing any third party software?\n\nA: You can do this using the screencapture CLI:\nscreencapture -T 5 -C ~/Desktop/screencapture.png\n\nDefine a delay using -T <seconds>. Use -C to capture the cursor too.\nAdd -i to capture interactively. This uses the normal capture region selection available from ⌘⇧4, however you can combine this with -T to add a delay so that it captures the tooltip in the region.\n\n\nA: ⌘+shift+3 should do the trick, it captures the entire screen.  The only downsides are that it doesn't grab the cursor as well and depending on what you want you may have to crop it a bit in Preview afterwards.\nThat's how I grabbed this image.\n\nA: The trick is simple, you have to keep press (⌘+SHIFT) first. Then hover mouse to make tool tip appear and press (4).\n\nA: You can do this with the Capture > Timed Screen option in the Grab utility. After starting the timer, you'll have 10 seconds to get back to what you want a shot of (including getting the tooltip to reappear).  Also, you can use the Grab application's preferences to control whether (& how) the mouse pointer appears in the shot. What it doesn't let you do is choose which region to take a shot of, it just grabs the entire screen; you'll have to crop it appropriately yourself.\n\nA: If you only want the tooltip in the screenshot (without capturing anything else in the background), a faster way would be to use the keyboard shortcut ⌘⇧4, then position the crosshair over the tooltip, then press space (the crosshair should now turn into a camera). Then simply click on the tooltip, and you’ll get a nice screenshot of it with a transparent background and even its shadow to boot!\nAn example:\n\n\nA: I was having the same issue & discovered that the 'disappearing' screen shots were being saved to Dropbox. \nCan't remember setting up that save-to destination... But worth a look if the answers above don't help. Only a problem on my MacBook Air running 10.9.4\n\nA: Weird. I had no trouble with (⌘+SHIFT+4) in Safari (7.0.2).\nThis was taken from this site.\n\n\nA: Simple way to do this : a small trick \n 1. just open you screen , for which you want to take screen shot \n 2. point to tool-tip , it will show that tooltip .\n 3  then capture whole screen by Command+Shift+3\n 4. preview above captured image , and expand to full screen \n 5. now use Command+Shift+4 to capture tool-tip\n\n", "Q: How to swap windows using JIS keyboard I have got a JIS keyboard layout recently, I always swap between windows using command + ` , now I have no idea how to do it.\nHere is the layouts of two found on the internet.\nJIS and US keyboard layout\n\nA: Is one of the keys on the right side of the keyboard (like ろ or ￥) maybe backtick? \nIf not, you can remap some key to backtick with KeyRemap4MacBook.

I am a relatively new Mac user, recently bought a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.9.1. \nI see that there are tagging capabilities within the file system. I'm concerned about portability. If I get a new computer in a few years, how would I transfer my tags to the new system? What if I want to move my files to a Windows or Linux machine? Can I see the tags on these operating systems? \nI just don't want to put some effort into the built-in tagging system only to have my tags useless at some point down the road.\n\nA: Tags are not 100% portable in that they don't always survive mailing or copying to other computers such as Linux or Windows. On that respect, it's more about those OS supporting the Apple filesystem. I am impressed that even copying tagged files to a SMB formatted USB drive preserves the tag metadata and most copy operations from and to another Mac via an HFS+ hard drive or share does preserve the tags well in practice. (Even copying the file to a 10.8 or older Mac didn't strip tags in my tests).\nApple's article covering tags, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5839, recommends:\n\nIf you want to include your Tags when sending files through Mail, Messages, or other apps, compress your files and folders before sending them.\n\n\nA: Yes, tags are completely portable as they are saved to the file as extended attributes. Copying/moving the file keeps the tags as they are saved as com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags to the file.\n\nA: I found an interesting article over here which goes into some detail about the portability of tags in macOS. There is some writeup but it attempts to answer the question, \"Which file systems and Cloud services preserve extended attributes?\".\n", "Q: How to rename all images together in OS X Mavericks? I am looking for the easy way to rename all images, or other groups of multiple files, together in OS X Mavericks.\nIs it possible with Preview or any other standard OS X application?\n\nA: Automator\nYou can use OS X's Automator.app to quickly rename batches of images. The Actions you want are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Selected Finder Items\n\n*Rename Finder Items\n\n\nUsing this approach you can rename files, change the case, or append/remove specific parts of the original file name.\n\nYou can create droplet like applications using Automator to make the whole process a single drag-and-drop.

I'm trying to set up a Mac to auto sync pictures and videos already available on the Mac with Google+, mostly because they allow an unlimited amount of photos and videos to be uploaded as long as they are downsized to X amount of pixels, which is fine by me (edit: I'll also accept suggestions on other services to use as a resolution to this problem, as long as they also allow unlimited storage for videos and images).\nSo I have installed the software, it seemingly works fine as pictures and videos are indeed showing up in Google+, but two things are worrying me.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I click the icon in the task bar, it tells me that there is a total of 3000 or so items to backup.

You can bypass the problem by electing to upload files in their original size (presumably you can turn this setting back to resizing as before when you've passed the bump that is the too-large-file).\n", "Q: Office for Mac 2014 I have already tried searching, but have not really found any decent resources relating to this.\nOffice 2011 for Mac is great (their have been many improvements since Office 2008). \nAnyway Microsoft has committed to their 3 year release cycle, but there is no beta or other news relating to Office 2014. Does anyone know when they are expecting to release it, or even a preview / beta?\nMy biggest issue with Office 2011 is its lack of support for retina displays - it simply looks ugly!\n\nA: There's no news on a release date. I'd venture to guess that the Office for Mac is busy working on Office for iPad.\nAs @h3nk mentions, Office 2011 was updated to support Retina Displays (Working fine on the Retina MacBook I'm writing this on).\n", "Q: Tool to monitor home network traffic & stats? I have a home network with several users, using both LAN & Wifi. I have a Billion 7800N router which is also my ADSl2 modem.\nIs there a tool or something I can use that monitors all traffic going through the router, including capturing packets? Some features im looking for is broadband usage per user/ip, packet inspection (not required but handy) and other general network stats.\nI was looking at Netuse network monitor from AppStore as it also uses the SNMP data on the router, but with no trial version im not willing to buy just yet.\nThanks\n\nA: You could put a hub on the outgoing port (ensuring all packets are visible) and hook a Mac up along with the modem and router WAN connection.  \nYour mac could then run Wireshark to perform deep packet inspection and analysis on all the traffic for as long as you care to collect the statistics.\n", "Q: iPad Air screen is black and unresponsive The screen of my 2014 iPad Air, is black and unresponsive, currently the alarm is going off (so I know it is working) but the screen is black and unresponsive. I have not dropped it, I have tried to power it off, but since there is no response, I don't know whether it had any effect.\nI have charged it fully overnight. I tested the charger on another device and it works fine. I don't have another Mac computer to connect it to. Yesterday was the first time I used Siri, could that have something to do with it? \nWhat else could I try?\n\nA: I like to connect devices with no visible display to iTunes and see that I can make a backup of the device. At that point, I follow the 6 step process (even if I don't think the first few will work, sometimes going through the shutdown motions revives the screen.)\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3281\nIf you can make a backup, you have a good base and then can try a restore. Also, if you haven't powered it off, that might do the trick without needing a computer.\n\nA: The black screen behavior could be caused by VoiceOver being turned on.  It's easy to accidentally do this, and, unless you know what's happened, difficult to turn it back off.\nTry triple-tapping the screen with three fingers.  If VoiceOver and the Screen Curtain are on, this will turn off the screen curtain. You can then turn off VoiceOver by connecting to iTunes or by following the instructions at http://www.personalmacgeniuses.com/2011/05/19/trapped-in-voiceover-limbo/.  \nIt's also possible that VoiceOver is configured to activate if the home button is triple clicked.  It's easy to do this when playing with Siri.\n\nA: It's easy to solve by pushing both the power and the home buttons at the same time in order to force it to restart.\nI've had this problem with two iPad Air 2, now I'm trying a third one. In my case it always happens after I charge it when the battery reaches the 83% of its capacity. \nI recommend you to go to an Apple Store. A nearly 600 € device, I have the 64 Gb model, shouldn't have this kind of issues.\n\nA: When the \"official\" solution didn't work (holding down power and home buttons at the same time), I found a YouTube posting by a very young fellow who had the perfect answer. Despite the fact that he wiggled during the entire video, he showed how to hold down the home button at the same time you plug in the power cord; immediately unplug the cord, and the device will restart. I was never so happy to see that white apple in the middle of my screen.\n\nA: You might have broke it by over heating or dropping it, take it to the apple store.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to CLI executable I have a couple CLI utilities I would like to map to key combinations. The scripts take no parameters, I merely need to invoke them.\nI've seen how to create keyboard shortcuts to apps, but can I point them to an executable somehow?\n\nA: In your case, you would want to use Automator. You do not need to know about AppleScript to use Automator (in fact, if you open up Automator, you will quickly find that it really is self-evident).\nThe trick is not just to tie your CLI service to an Automator app, but to be able to get to that globally using a Keyboard shortcut. That can be achieved using a Service. This tutorial explains quite well how to do what you are looking for... in fact, describing a very similar scenario.\nI take no credit for the tutorial content, only found it to solve a similar problem (I needed to map some drives at Startup without Finder.app opening while doing so).\n\nA: You can also do this with Keyboard Maestro, using a macro such as this:\n\n", "Q: Mac OSX - Transfer Connect to Server Favorites to new computer?

I am not very knowledgable as to how to troubleshoot to see if there is mono or x11 issue, I just installed them to be able to use keepass on my macbook.\nIS there anyone else experiencing this same issue? \nWhat steps could I take to begin troubleshooting this?\n\nA: A useful troubleshooting tool for any OS X application is opensnoop which lets you see file activity on your system. If you run sudo opensnoop -v | grep mono-sgen before launching KeePass you'll be able to watch which files it is opening as it launches.\nI ran this to troubleshoot another question about KeePass problems and on my system the first launch of KeePass generates a lot of activity where Mono is opening and caching the fonts on the system in ~/.cache/fontconfig. While it is doing this the application appears to be doing nothing, as the UI doesn't appear until this task is complete which takes minutes on my system. Luckily it only seems to want to do this once, as subsequent starts are about what I'd expect.\nAnd this is only guesswork but upgrading Mono, XQuartz or KeePass or installing other fonts might prompt Mono to regenerate this cache, resulting in another one off slow application launch. Just something to be aware of.\n\nA: Does it happen in a new user account? If it does, that issue is system wide and you may need to remove the app and wait for a compatible version. If not, it means there may be a preference file interfering with normal use. That's a good place to start.

On one in particular, I'm seeing unexpected behavior when logging in to a Windows fileserver.\nFrom Finder, I hit cmd-k, then enter smb:\\\\servername01\\\nThe Finder immediately logs into the server without asking for a username or password. All fileshares on the server are visible but inaccessible. Login name is GUEST (all caps). To fix, I have to eject the fileserver and then log in using smb:\\\\username@servername01\\. OS X then prompts for my Windows domain password as expected.\nI have deleted my login keychain and deleted all relevant passwords from the system keychain. The behavior is reproduced in other accounts. However, all other Mavericks computers don't have this problem. I also have deleted related preference files (com.apple.finder comes to mind). Is there anywhere else that this setting could be stored?\n\nA: The two places that come immediately to mind are the favorites section of Go to Server... so you might clear that out. Secondly, look in the Login Items pane of Users & Groups preference pane.\nAlso, if more than one user logs in to the Mac, be sure to eject the share before fast user switching (or logging out all users but one) to prevent their mount from controlling the access.\nApple is in the process of switching from AFP to SMB2 as the default share - so perhaps some changes there are not completely done or documented.\n", "Q: Just upgraded Mavericks server to 10.9.2 and my virtual hosts partially work Just upgraded Mavericks server to 10.9.2 and my virtual hosts partially work.

I am using the new Mac Pro (MacPro6,1), in case that is relevant. (Perhaps the PCIe flash drive is just not capable for whatever reason.)\nWhen I point Boot Camp at a Windows 7 ISO, I get this dialog, of course:\n\nYour bootable USB drive could not be created\nBoot Camp only supports Windows 8 installation on this platform. Please use an ISO file for Windows 8 installation.\n\nI'd love to know if anyone has any hacks to lower the minimum required version to Windows 7. Most of the posts I see talking about Boot Camp and Mavericks say that the wizard offers you Windows 7. I assume, then, that this change has happened in one of the updates since Mavericks was first released (or a bunch of people hastily updated their Lion/Mountain Lion blogs with Mavericks / 10.9 just for Google juice).\nOh, how I would love to follow the dialog's advice, and \"use an ISO file for Windows 8 installation.\" That's only half sarcastic; I hate Windows 8 with a passion, but I honestly did try to make it work, and couldn't (see below). Still I am more interested in getting Boot Camp to allow me to install Windows 7, because that's what I'm really trying to do. Of course any suggestions for bypassing the below problems will be appreciated as well.\nI've seen other posts where they explain how to get the bootable USB drive working by editing the minimum machine required in Boot Camp's info.plist, but I couldn't find anything in that file to mess with to lower the minimum Windows version supported - that all seemed to be about hardware requirements. I actually have had absolutely no problems creating a bootable USB drive for Boot Camp (once I realized that Windows requires about 40 more bytes than typically found on a 4GB thumb drive), or getting Boot Camp to offer me the option to use a bootable USB drive. Now I just want Boot Camp to allow me to use Windows 7.\n\nBackground: Why Windows 8 isn't working for me\nI was actually trying to get Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 to work, but encountered errors in all attempts. For 8.1 I received the following error message  well into setup and long after the BOOTCAMP drive was formatted (evidence: exhibit A):\n\nWindows installation encountered an unexpected error. Verify that the installation sources are accessible, and restart the installation.\n  \nError code: 0xC0000005\n\nFor Windows Server 2012 R2 I got this error message after formatting the BOOTCAMP partition but before hitting Next (evidence: exhibit B):\n\nWe couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one. For more information, see the Setup log files.\n\nI looked at this Apple KB article, but it's a joke. The \"answer\" is to format my USB drive using FAT. So that Boot Camp Assistant can immediately format it all over again. Genius.\nI then tried the instructions listed here, which sounded quasi-promising:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1671442\nBut this made things even worse. I ended up with the following error message upon choosing the BOOTCAMP partition and clicking Next (I forgot to take a picture of my monitor here, sorry):\n\nWindows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed on GPT disks.\n\nI tried all of these techniques multiple times with ISOs from MSDN; and even re-downloaded all of the ISOs in case any of them were damaged along the way. To further prove to myself that the ISOs were not the problem, I created stand-alone VMs using each one in Parallels, and they were created without issue.\n\nReally, though. I just want Boot Camp to let me use Windows 7. Really.\n\nA: This one:\n\nWindows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR\n  partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed on GPT\n  disks.\n\nCan be worked around like this:\n\nUsing the Bootcamp assistant, revert the HD to a single OSX partition\n  layout. Then use the Disk utility to shrink the OSX parition, leaving\n  \"free space\" for the planned Windows installation.\n\nThen, boot from yor Windows USB stick (\"EFI boot\") and select the free space as target for the installation.\nThis worked for me.\nRegarding Windows 7: I don't know. I'd like to install Windows 7 as well...\n\nA: So I discovered a couple of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 simply isn't supported under Boot Camp on the new Mac Pro (see the Mac Pro table here). I suspect this may be related to drivers - perhaps the PCIe or GPUs? So I don't think there's any way to \"trick\" Boot Camp into doing it (initially I just suspected that Microsoft may have paid Apple to raise the support floor to get Win8 numbers up, and that the restriction was artificial).\n\n*One of the errors I received, We couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one, was due specifically to having a Thunderbolt device connected. Once I disconnected that I could get a little further, but still am not able to fully install Windows. The error I get now is Windows could not update the computer's boot configuration. Installation cannot proceed.\n\nSupport is useless. \n\n\n*\n\n*Apple support: \"Oh, Windows installer can start? Call Microsoft; at that point it becomes their problem.\" \n\n*Microsoft support: \"Oh, this is a Mac? Call Apple; we can't help you fix problems with their software/hardware.\"\n\n\nWonder who Apple would tell me to call if my problem was installing Mac OS under Boot Camp? Hmmm, maybe I should try that...\nGuess I will have to bring it in. Wonder if any of the geniuses have set up Boot Camp on this machine yet...\n", "Q: How to exclude Mail messages from Finder search? I want to exclude Mail messages from showing up in Finder search.\n->FINDER, NOT SPOTLIGHT<- \nI have asked this question on other platforms, and I have found the emphasis is very necessary. Yes, you can exclude Mail from Spotlight by going to the Spotlight preference pane and unchecking Mail. This has no effect on Finder, at least in Mavericks (it did in Lion. I skipped Mountain Lion, but I believe it also suffers from this problem.)\nYou can  also narrow what IS returned in Finder search, by clicking the plus sign and adding filters. But this is not a solution either: you can only filter what \"is\" returned, there is no \"is not\" option.\nFor bonus points, answers about how to exclude folders would also be wonderful. If you have ebooks, you know that they too turn up in pretty much every search. Put simpler, I just want the Spotlight preferences to apply to Finder...like they used to.\n\nA: First of all, I should point out that — despite what it looks like — search in Finder is indeed Spotlight but with more options shown. The following information is based on research I've just done on my Mac running Mavaricks (10.9.2):\nThe reason why it doesn't work to just uncheck Mail is because (confusingly) the SysPrefs > Spotlight > Search Results tab only applies to the top-right corner Spotlight search and not the one in Finder.\nHowever, there is a work-around that answers 2 of your question and proofs that Spotlight is the engine for Finder searches (and ditto for other apps, including Mail and Outlook):\nYou can exclude a folder from Spotlight-powered searches by dragging said folder to the list in the SysPrefs > Spotlight > Privacy tab.\nCaveat/but/proof: \nIf you were to do this with the data folder of Mail.app (~/Library/Mail), you'll get this warning:\n\n...Telling you that \"the search feature won't work in some applications\" If you click OK, Mail messages won't show up in Finder (or Spotlight) anymore but the same will be the case for the internal search feature in  Mail.app itself, since it's Spotlight-powered...\n(@Aaron Bertrand: Same for Outlook, since it's also Spotlight-powered. See first link above)\nWith regular folders — i.e. not in your hidden-by-default Library folder — you won't get a warning and hiding'll work with no caveats.\nThere actually is an option to tell Finder to not seach for a given type by writing \"NOT eml\" for instance, in the search field, which would exclude e-mail files. If you really wanted to, you could create an Automator-service and bind ⌘+F to it via SysPrefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts. The Automator AppleScript would be akin to:\nactivate application \"Finder\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"f\" using command down\n    keystroke \" NOT eml\"\n    key code 123 using command down #123 = Left Arrow, so we're moving the cursor to the beginning of the field\nend tell\n\n(I suck at AppleScript so there might be a cleverer way to go about it)\n\nA: It is inconvenient, but if you add -kind:mail after your search term in the Finder, it will exclude Mail messages too.\n\nA: The root cause of this problem is that Finder by default searches \"This Mac\" - i.e. everywhere, including the Mail folders - so every search is dominated by dozens of unwanted email hits. Fortunately there's a simple solution:\nIn Finder...Preferences...Advanced, select \"Search the current folder\". This will limit the search to whatever folder you were in when you requested the search, thus excluding emails (and a lot of other unnecessary stuff too by the way). Problem solved.\nHere's a link to the details:\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2013/03/12/change-finder-search-to-look-in-current-folder-rather-than-everywhere-in-mac-os-x/\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but up to this date the issue with Finder search including way too many results has not been solved by Apple. What has changed is the format needed for the suggested answer (it doesn't work anymore). Also I found a way to very quickly add the suggested trick to any search, no typing required.\nStep 1: create a search that excludes the file types you don't want to be included in your searches. I used NOT kind:olk15 AND NOT kind:eml AND NOT kind:ZIP The olk15 is for Outlook mail, that will not be excluded when only filtering 'eml' out. I also excluded ZIP files, but that is a personal preference.\nNote: as you can see I did NOT search for any text, so the results will be about any file on your system. No problem, please read on.\nStep 2: use the 'Save' search option and add the search filter to your sidebar. I named my search 'NotEmail'\n\nThere is no step 3 :-)\nWhenever you want to do a clean search, first click your saved search and then use the search field to enter the text within that search you want to find.\n", "Q: playing a podcast in i tunes with OS 10.8.5 I have put a podcast in my podcasts folder in i-tunes media.

You can redirect the output by simply adding > destination to the end of the command.\n\nA: There's a few problems with your script.\nFirst, you're sending the final output from head to /dev/null, so you won't see anything from head at all.\nSecond, you're not actually opening the files, you're just passing the list of files found by find into head, so even if you remove the > /dev/null you'll just see the name of the first file. If head reads from stdin, it treats stdin as the 'file', not as a list of files to process.\nInstead, you'll want to do something more like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nDIR=\"$HOME/SpaceMonkey/MATLAB/Luo-Rudy\"\nwhile true\ndo\n    for filename in $(find $DIR -name '*.m')\n    do\n        head -n 1 $filename\n        # or if you want the filename listed too:\n        #echo \"$filename $(head -n 1 $filename)\"\n    done\n    sleep 300\ndone\n\nNote also that if you used the zsh shell, you could achieve this more simply:\nhead -n 1 $DIR/**/*.m\n\nThe zsh shell (and some others) allows recursive file globbing, to let you pass all .m files (recursively) to head as command line arguments in one go.\n", "Q: Audio interfaces just broken on my iMac? For the past year I've owned two audio interfaces. Semi-recently I obtained a wonderful new iMac and I love it. I own a M-Audio Fast Track and a Focusrite 2i2 and although I love this new iMac I'm having extreme issues with these audio interfaces. When I talk or record anything the audio stutters and sometimes just cuts out completely. It's the same case for both devices. I've had this problem since before I upgraded to OSX Mavericks and I don't know if it related to my installation of Adobe Premiere Pro. I can't use my audio interfaces at all with Premiere so I just use it as an audio device for other editing software. Anyone else have the same problem or anybody have some suggestions? \n\nA: I had trouble getting my Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 to appear as an option in Adobe Premiere Pro CC on a Mac running Mavericks. It showed up in Audition, just not in Premiere.\nGo to Audio Midi Setup in the Utilities folder on your Mac (or just search for Audio Midi Setup in Spotlight) and look for Adobe Premiere Pro in the list. There should be a check box to add the audio interface there. Then be sure to quit Audio Midi Setup. I think it doesn't stick unless you quit.\nThen go into Premiere Preferences > Audio Hardware and choose System Default Input/Output. This should make it work.

After installing, next time your iPhone crashes, you can check the 'Possible Causes' list in Crash Reporter for its guess on the cause. You can then try to delete the package in Cydia and see if that fixes the problem.\n\nA: Just remove this tweak (StatusHUD 2 - 2.0.0)\n\nA: I had a crash if I used the flipcontrolcenter. I removed nitrous and all is fine again.\n", "Q: It is possible to create/install an iOS app like the macOS parental controls? Is it possible to create a app like macOS parental controls in iOS for giving permission for accessing certain apps on the device?\n\nA: Yes, to at least some degree. Apps like OurPact allow control of which apps your child is allowed to use.\n\nA: The sandboxing applied to all iOS apps does not allow this. You can enforce some restrictions via Settings->General->Restrictions but compared to Parental Control the options are rather limited.\n", "Q: Edit track name of track without changing filename If you edit Name of a file in iTunes, the filename changes too, not just the tag. Is there a way to avoid this? I want top preserve the original filename untouched when I edit Name. Is there a simple easy-to-install malware-less 3rd party tool for this?\n\nA: It was easier than expected... within iTunes itself, in Preferences→Advanced, there is an option \"Keep iTunes Media folder organised\". Uncheck it and iTunes will leave the filenames as is.\n", "Q: Can you switch the top case and keyboard to a different language? I really regret not getting a CTO 2012 macbook pro before they went to the retina only. I was wanting a different keyboard on a MacBook Pro that has an nvidia 650 GPU and a 1680x1050 monitor.\nOnce when I took my computer in to an Apple store the genius bar guy offered to switch my keyboard to a US keyboard; so, that would imply that it is possible. So, does anybody know definitively if I can just get a MacBook Pro with a US keyboard and then just find the appropriate top case and keyboard with the language I want and then switch them out or should I just keep hoping one shows up refurbished? \n\nA: I have done it on a PPC 17\" MBP equivalent and also on 2011 15\" MBP. It needs plenty of time and care. Say 24 hours for first time. Look on iFixiT for \"how to s\" and read them through carefully two or three times. My original reason to do so was to change keyboard from Spanish to GB English.\n\nA: Please, do not attempt this yourself! A top case replacement requires moving EVERY component from one top case to the other and in some cases this includes the trackpad. I am a certified technician and this is something that is best done by someone skilled and in an ESD-safe environment. Go to the Apple Store and let them replace it for their fee or find an AASP that might be cheaper. \nShould you still want to try it yourself be warned, ESD damage is very likely plus there is no guarantee on the part you purchase. You really do have to be careful with this because trying the wrong one could mean the parts won't fit or the keyboard isn't compatible with the logic board connector. Having the work done by someone with direct access to the Apple part means that the work and part are guaranteed so should there be an issue with the replacement or the repair you are covered! Cheers\n\nA: It's possible, sure. Having poked around inside of the unibody-MacBooks a bit over the years, I wouldn't say that it falls into the \"easy to do\" category.\nI haven't done it personally but when I first got my '08 Unibody MacBook Pro, the keyboard keys were crooked. I went to an Apple-certified repair shop and they replaced the keyboard with a brand new one. \nAFAIK you buy the keyboard as a kit that you can then install instead of the current one.\n", "Q: After 10.9.2 updated, OSX crashed, contextual menu broken 1/After I updated to 10.9.2 this morning, my OSX keeps crashing over and over again. Up to now is almost 10 times or more. \n2/Besides that issue, I also found my Contextual Menu in Finder really weird. It's messy and lost \"Services\" menu item. (see image below)\n\nI doubt that some of my Apple Scripts may be incompatible with 10.9.2 and caused such crash. Can anybody guide me how and where to remove those add-on scripts?\n3/ Also when I press any keys from the Hot Keys section above on the keyboard, it caused OSX to crash. Does anybody know how to fix the crashing?\n\nA: It is very probably caused by Total Finder app. Try to update it or simply quit it and run again. It worked for me and contextual menu is back.\n\nA: Repair your disc permissions after update might help. I updated last night and shut down for college this morning. Upon booting I have a grey screen with a flashing question mark folder. I've tried all the reset tricks the mac simply can't 'see' the hard drive. My directory is corrupted. I cant pin it to the update. I've done some tests and found my hard to be fine. But my mac cant read/ power of ANY internal hard drive! Any hard drive I put it won't spin up. external is ok but annoying since I have a 2.0 enclosure. I can only surmise the hard drive cable is faulty. It had to happen 2 days before a project in college is due. My mac is only a year and half old and only a few months out of warranty. Thanks apple. Thanks a lot.\n", "Q: Can I get the ipsw file off my iPhone 3gs and install it on my iPhone 4s? I still have my old iPhone 3gs (AT&T) with iOS 6. I have a back up of it as well. I also have a iPhone 4s (Sprint) with iOS 7.\nCan I grab the ipsw file off my iPhone 3gs and install it on my iPhone 4s? \nI will not install any ipsw from the net. It is not worth the risk of getting an infected or spyware file. \n\nA: No, even if you obtained the IPSW, it would not install since there are different IPSWs for different devices.\nYou can check the authenticity of an IPSW per this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can an .ipsw firmware restore image's origin be verified?\n\nA: Here is a reputable website that gives a lot of information about each IPSW, and it gives you the direct link to the file on Apple's servers for each one. Famous jailbreakers @icj_ and @iH8sn0w run the website.\nhttp://www.icj.me/ios/all\n", "Q: Macbook Pro volume greyed out -- no internal speakers available The volume on my macbook pro has suddenly become greyed out. I haven't installed any updates or made any modifications to the computer, it just suddenly became greyed out after waking the macbook up from sleeping.\nI've tried resetting the PRAM, but I don't hear any chime at all when I start up my computer, no matter how long I wait/how many times the computer re-restarts itself.\nThere also seem to be no internal speakers detected when I go into system preferences. For both input and output the computer detects 0 devices.\nThanks so much in advance for any help!!\n\nA: I just had this same problem. I didn't realise straight away but it must have happened after taking out my headphones. I accidentally solved it by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your headphones are plugged in and sound is working.\n\n*Alt-click the speaker icon at the top of the screen, then click on 'Sound Preferences'.\n\n*On the sound preferences screen, unplug your headphones.\n\n\nA: Try switching back to your internal speakers with [alt]-clicking on the speaker icon in menubar. Many interfaces don't support volume adjustment and thus the control becomes greyed out.\n\n\nA: Try picking up some compressed air and using it to blow out any dust or debris that might be in the headphone jack. Make sure to first expel any liquid build (white frost-like substance) before you spray in the headphone jack.\nYou can also try fishing around in there (gently) with a ridiculously small flathead screwdriver.\nOne question for you, is there a red light coming out of the headphone jack? That's usually a bad sign that the audio jack thinks there's an optical audio device plugged in (permanently.) If you're MacBook is under warranty the Genius Bar will replace the Main Logic Board for free (or about $300 if it is Out of Warranty.)\nOtherwise, the simple and inexpensive Griffin iMic will provide USB audio input & output.\n\nA: I had no output from speakers, or headphones. And the System Preferences - Volume was greyed out.\nI tried everything up to including a PRAM reset and nothing worked.\nTook it to the company tech and after awhile he figured out what was wrong.\nThe inner head phone jack was dirty. He  cleaned it with a qtip or a special computer cleaning device. Apparently there’s a internal sensor in the jack that will prevent the internal output from functioning if it’s to dirty. It’s not like a dropped the computer in a dirty pond. I would have never figured that out.\nAnyways, that’s what fixed it for me with the same symptoms as listed.\n\nA: I just blew into the headphone jack - problem solved!\n\nA: The switch in the headphone input could be stuck, you can put in a headphone jack and wiggle it around.\nDon't be afraid to use a little force, just don't break of the plug.\nI had this problem too and this solved it for me at least.\n\nA: I had this same problem with my MacBook Pro, and used the technique described by dennismuys. I inserted and removed my headphone plug about a dozen times, and the internal speakers started working again. I have no idea what could possibly have gotten in the jack to keep the switch from closing. Lint maybe.\n\nA: I have had the same problem twice. And what I did was (for the first time[i am listing two so there are more possibilities]) \n1st. restart my laptop. I know that it sounds cliche. But it works most of the time. \n2nd. If all else fails. Try playing with the volume buttons on the keyboard. And this one sounds silly but it helps. Try the second one and then restart your laptop. That is what I did. \n", "Q: Hide Applications from other Spaces in Application Switcher With System Preferences->Mission Control->\"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\" disabled, I would really like the application switcher (cmd+tab) to hide applications from other spaces.\nIs this possible in Mavericks or is there a third-party application that provides this? Note, I would prefer the application switcher to remain as it is, just hide the applications only active on other spaces.\n\nA: Windowflow - free for a limited time and gives some options for different spaces and such.\nWitch - 12,99 € and has an option that will only show apps in the current space.\nWindowSwitcher - 3,59 € and it comes very close to your needs, check it out.\nAs far as an native solution to your problem: I don't think there is a setting or command that makes the application switcher behave like this.\nDefinitely check out WindowSwitcher I honestly think it is what you are looking for!\np.s. prices were correct at the time of posting.\n\nA: In my application Command-Tab Plus for this function is responsible for this option in the settings\n\n", "Q: Google Chrome on OSX - disable password autofill How can I disable password autofill/autosave in Google Chrome without deleting all my passwords from the Keychain? I tried just disabling autofill, but Chrome keeps filling out passwords and still conflicts with LastPass.\nI want to keep the passwords in the Keychain to use them on my iPhone/iPad with iCloud Keychain, but in Chrome I only want to use LastPass. Using Lastpass and Chrome autofill together does not really work properly, since they seem to conflict. I have to try multiple times to fill out login data etc.\nAny help is much appreciated. Or should I file a bugreport with Chrome?\n\nA: In Chrome, open the Preferences\nscroll down and use Advanced\nFind Passwords and Forms and un-check it.\n\nTo prevent Chrome using already stored passwords remove it in keyhain.\nYou have to do that for every Chrome password saved in keychain :(\n\n\nA: Open Safari. Click Preferences on the top left next to the Apple logo. A box appears. You can now see Autofill on top. Click Autofill. Now select or unselect as per your requirements. \n\nA: In a similar vein to Buscar's solution. A way of getting chrome to forget already entered passwords and usernames is to clear browser history. Chrome -> Clear Browsing Data -> Make sure the passwords checkbox is selected and that \"Obliterate the following items from:\" is set sufficiently far back. \n\nA: This is working with my Google Chrome. \nJust go into History in Chrome or Press Ctrl+H and clear your history. Obliterate the following items from the beginning of time. Then uncheck the password check button and hit clear browsing data.\n\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to allow opening unsigned pkg file? I prefer to use keyboard shortcuts rather than the mouse. Is there a a way to define a keyboard shortcut equivalent to Right-Clicking a pkg file and choosing \"Open\", which warns about opening an unsigned package?\nNote this is not the same as the regular File->Open, which simply rejects opening the package altogether.\n\nA: You can do this with Keyboard Maestro using a macro such as this:\n\n", "Q: I need to log into apple mail to read new messages received from outlook I have a macbook Air and want to run outlook mail instead of using Apple mail. I have set up outlook as imap and it seems to be working fine, i can send and receive messages but for some reason I can't view them, they appear and then disappear instantly. I'm having to use Apple email to read my messages. I have tried syncing and everything I know, MS were useless. Do I need to remove Apple email? Can anyone advise please\n\nA: There is no interference with having more than one program retrieve IMAP mail. \nJust quit Apple Mail and don't launch it while you work out whatever is not happy within Outlook. \nThen your server will only see the requests from Outlook and you can focus on troubleshooting that setup. If you want to ask a second question on how to troubleshoot Outlook - just list your relevant details (version, etc) and document which troubleshooting article you are following from the Office support website (it's quite good in most instances) and you'll probable get some expert help.\n\nA: First of all it would be helpful to get more details about your situation.\nAs far as I can guess :\nYou have an Outlook App\nAnd you have Apple Mail.\nOR :\nYou have an Outlook Account\nAnd you have Apple Mail.\nApple Mail is just the software. And you can't delete it, because it is integrated in the System.\nIf you have an Outlook app and you are registered in Outlook Mail Services, then you just have to log in and everything should be fine. If your mails don't show up, it is more like a Software problem. So make sure the software is updated and (if you are running Mavericks) compatible with OS X Mavericks.\nHowever, if you try to view your mails via Apple Mail and they don't show up, then it is indeed an error in the Settings or in the Software. \nIn that case I would get the latest OS X updates and try again. If it doesnt work it is again an Outlook problem.\n", "Q: Can I make Calendar on OS X automatically show me more upcoming weeks when focusing on today? In Calendar on OS X (I’m using Mavericks), in month view I can hit CMD-T to focus on today’s date.\nWhen I do this, Calendar shows me all weeks in the current month. Near the end of the month (like we are now), this means I see the current week, the next week, and four previous weeks.\nIt would be more useful if Calendar showed me the current week and the next five weeks instead — I’m not particularly interested in what I’ve done recently, but seeing what I’m doing over the next few weeks would be good.\nIs there any way to change the date range Calendar shows in month view when I focus on today?\n\nA: I do not know about Automatic.\nBut if you just move (scroll) the today to the first line of the Month view, you will see the following 5 weeks.\nMaking it automatic is a problem, since the Month view is what it says. It has been set to show the month, while Today is a variable.\n", "Q: OS X: Set up one folder as \"extension\" of another, symlink-style? I have two folders on two different Volumes:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Volumes/SSD/my-important-folder\n\n*/Volumes/HDD/my-extension-of-important-folder\nIn the second folder I put large files and folders so they do not take up all the space on the SSD. In order to have everything in one place I create symlinks from the first to the second folder, like so:\n/Volumes/SSD/my-important-folder/big-file is a symlink to /Volumes/HDD/my-extension-of-important-folder/big-file\nThis is useful because big files get stored on the HDD yet they are available as if they were stored on the SSD. But this has the disadvantage that I have to create a symlink for every file oder folder that I add to the folder on HDD.\nIt would be really useful if I could say to the OS: if I call a file that is not in /Volumes/SSD/my-important-folder, please look it up in /Volumes/HDD/my-extension-of-important-folder.\nThe folder on the HDD would then be a real extension of the folder on the SSD.\nCan this be done? I am running OS X 10.9.1\n\nA: As far as I know, you can't do that directly but I'm not sure I understand why you'd want to?\nWhy not just symlink the entire folder and never worry about it going forward?\nIf it's important to you that it's only large files that are moved to the HDD, you could create a Folder Action in Automator and run a bash script that checked file size and based on that moved and created the symlink automatically (I'm assuming you've got some tech skill since you know what symlink even is :) With that said, I'd be happy to post more detailed instructions if need be).\n\nA: I would look at this in another way. \nI would create several folders in the filesystem:\n/Volumes/SSD/Data\n/Volumes/SSD/ActualDataOnSSD\n/Volumes/HDD/ActualDataOnHDD\n\nThen folder actions.\nIf any data get stored in /Volumes/SSD/Data based on its size and move it to one of the two folders.\nIf any data get stored in /Volumes/SSD/ActualDataOnSSD or /Volumes/HDD/ActualDataOnHDD, create a symlink for them in /Volumes/SSD/Data.\nThis seems to satisfy you need, however I do have big concerns when it comes to saving a file that's being moved. \n\nA: Try using a command like this:\nln -s /dir2/* /dir1\n\nln skips files that exist on the target, and it doesn't recreate existing symlinks.\nTo run the command when /dir2/ is modified, save for example this plist as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/some.label.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>some.label</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>bash</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>ln -s /dir2/* /dir1</string>\n  </array>\n  <key>WatchPaths</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/dir2/</string>\n  </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThen run launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/some.label.plist.\n", "Q: Where on the OSX Mavericks is the Applications folder supposed to be? All my Music, Movies, Documents etc, are stored under /Users/myusername/\nBut it seems that Applications are stored under:   /Macintosh HD/Applications\nIs there something wrong with my installation ? Is it supposed to be there ? I don't recall moving the applications folder there. It just seems weird that it isn't stored in my user directory.\nCould parallels have done this?\n\nA: There is absolutely nothing wrong. That is how your Apple is suppose to be. /Applications , /Library , and /System are managed and used primarily by the OS. Your files should be in your user folder /Users/john for example. If you want you can create another folder in your home folder (user folder) called Applications or Programs or \"whatever\" and put third party apps in there. It is your choice but you shouldn't remove any applications from the /Application folder should they automatically be installed there or be default programs, doing so will result in issues.\n", "Q: Any fixes for Dock not following the mouse to move to different monitors in Mavericks? Just installed 10.9.2 and none of the bugs listed here are fixed for me. Especially the responsive scrolling bug (that for me occurs in the Mac App Store app) and the Dock not following the mouse to move to the active monitor.\nI still haven't found a solution that fixes the responsive scrolling issue.\nThe workaround for fixing the Dock issue is not that elegant either:\n\nMavericks introduced the ability to have the Dock and Menu Bar appear\n  not just on the primary display, but on your secondary displays, as\n  well. Unfortunately, after having lived with this functionality since\n  release, I’ve found its implementation more frustrating than useful.\n  With the dock set to auto-hide, it’s sometimes impossible to actually\n  cause the dock to appear when and where you want it.\nThe way this most often manifests is that the Dock will decide—in what\n  feels like a very arbitrary fashion—that it will only appear on one of\n  the two secondary displays. When I mouse to the bottom of the primary\n  display to summon the auto-hidden dock, nothing happens. If I mouse\n  over to the bottom of one of the secondary displays, the dock pops up\n  just as it’s supposed to, but returning the cursor to the bottom of\n  the primary display does nothing. The workaround appears to be to move\n  the mouse all the way up to the top of the primary display and then\n  slowly and deliberately move it to the bottom—as if you’re saying\n  \"Okay, OS X, here comes the airplane! Open up the Dock now! Here it\n  comes!\" This usually is enough to snap the dock to where you want it\n  to be.\nI very much like the menu bars at the top of each monitor, but as with\n  most of the other things about multi-monitor support in Mavericks,\n  there’s no way to throw out the bad bathwater without also pitching\n  the baby with it. The only way to get the Dock to stay sensibly where\n  you want it to is to disable the new fullscreen behavior, which also\n  kills the per-monitor menu bar settings.\n\nIs there a way to fix the Dock issue without being forced to move the mouse to the top or bottom edges of the screen to force it to move?\n\nA: Are you using a trackpad by any chance? I too thought the way the Dock popped up on different monitors was completely arbitrary or broken, until I found out how it actually works:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you move the cursor to the bottom edge of either screen and keep your finger on the trackpad, the dock will pop up right away\n\n*If you flick the cursor to the bottom edge of either screen (removing your finger from the trackpad as you finish the movement), the dock will not pop up\n\n\nThis is designed like this intentionally so that as you're mousing around in full-screen apps, you don't inadvertently trigger the dock when you use controls at the bottom of the full-screen window.\nIt actually works really well, once you know how it works ;-)\n\nA: Well, you can disconnect and then reconnect your secondary monitor but that isn't exactly elegant either... \nIt should be noted that — at least in my testing — the Dock consistently won't follow the mouse to a different monitor if 2 monitors are placed \"on top\" of each other like so:\n\n(Neither when the Dock is shown nor when set to appear-on-mouseover)\nIf you place the monitors next to each other, the Dock follows the mouse (= active monitor). Just by looking at it, it seems OS X's logic is that the Dock always appear on the bottom and so 2 screens stacked only need 1 Dock at the bottom of the bottom-most screen. Not that I entirely follow the logic behind that :)\n\nA: This has been a major headache of mine since 10.9, and with no fix. It's almost like it happens spontaneously. However, 10.9.2 totally remedied this for me. Install Tinker Tool and mess around with some of the dock settings. This was installed when I updated to 10.9.2, and I have since removed Tinker Tool. I have no idea if this modified the right line of code in the right file to fix this annoyance, but it's fixed for me. My screen doesn't even have to be active for the dock to show. As in I can just move from the left screen, across the main screen, to the right screen and mouse down to activate the dock and it pops right up. No clicking the right screen or anything. I used to have to do the shove the mouse down trick also, but not anymore.\n", "Q: How to update 10.4.11 OS X? Is there a way to update 10.4.11 OS X to the newest version of OS X? I have Mac Pro (2 x 2 GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon with 1 GB ram). \n\nA: You'll have to at least buy Snow Leopard to upgrade. You can buy it from the Apple Store for $20, and then the upgrade from that to Mavericks is free.\n\nA: Check the specifications of your mac. It appears that you are running a MacPro1,1. This machine will only upgrade as far as Lion (10.7). If your machine isn't listed it can't run it.

When I tried to connect in Windows by cisco vpn client, connection was successfull. Can the problem be in that the vpn is based on windows?\n\nA: The Cisco VPNClient app is not officially supported in 10.8.  You may have some luck by using Java Preferences to specify the 32-bit JVM and either disabling the 64-bit or changing it to be secondary.  \nYou're better off replicating the settings from your Cisco configuration into a new native VPN (IPSec) connection.\nLook for the encrypted Group password in your .pcf file, then head over here to get the decrypted value.

This is default on Windows with Outlook, I just haven't found any Mac apps that will replicate it yet. \nAny ideas, suggestions, tips?\n\nA: This is currently not possible solely with OS X and Mail.\nHowever, third-party apps such as Mail Unread Menu can add an icon to the menu bar.\n\n", "Q: Mounting SMB network share from Mavericks recovery mode I would like to be able back up my macbook on a weekly basis doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into recovery mode\n\n*mount a windows SMB network share\n\n*use disk utility to save a disk image to the network share\n\n*possibly automate this process\n\n\nThis seems like it should be possible however when I try and mount the SMB share I get this error message:\n-bash-3.2# mount_smbfs\ndyld: Library not loaded: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SMBClient.framework/Versions/A/SMBClient\n   Referenced from: /sbin/mount_smbfs\n   Reason: image not found\nTrace/BPT trap: 5\n\nI have also attempted to copy the framework folder from the main system volume. However the recovery partition is read-only.\nAm I incorrectly trying to mount the SMB share or do I have to make a custom recovery image thats supports SMB?\n\nA: This is, because the binary for the framework that’s required is not part of the Recovery System.\nI have been trying various things for over an hour now and the only thing that works appears to be AFP:\nmkdir /Volumes/VOLUMENAME\nmount_afp afp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@000.00.000.00/VOLUMENAME /Volumes/VOLUMENAME \n\nOne important thing that kept this from working for me was that I had used /Volumes/VOLUMENAME instead of the correct /VOLUMENAME in the afp URL.\n", "Q: What is happening when my Mac is being optimized after an OS X update?

I know how to transfer an app from one account to another account as I have read the whole procedure for transfering apps from Apple's Documentation.\nHowever, if I want to upload a new version of the app after transferring I need the bundle identifier to be the same as the previous version of the app. I don't have that same identifier.\nHow can I upload a new version of that app? Do I need to create a new provisioning profile?\n\nA: \nI need the bundle identifier to be the same as the previous version of the app. I don't have that same identifier.\n\nThe identifier is transferred along with the app, so once the app is transferred you continue to use the old identifier which has been transferred along with it. Therefore you are free to submit updates as if you were submitting updates to the old app.\n\nDo I need to create a new provisioning profile?\n\nYes you will. You can do this from the Member Centre or Xcode as you would have done for the app on the old account.\n", "Q: Why doesn't OS X migrate printer settings after clean install? I've been seeing this since Leopard (10.5). If I erase my hard disk before installing a new version of OS X, the install the OS, then migrate all settings over from a cloned backup using Migration Assistant, everything is preserved except printers. Anyone else? To make matters worse, I just installed Mavericks (10.9.2) for the first time, and after the migration, not only were no printers preserved, but the OS did not automatically offer to download drivers for my HP 2015dn printer (either networked or via USB). I had to download the drivers (i.e. PPDs) manually.\nIs this to be expected?\n\nA: No, printers are usually transferred when you restore a backup using backup software such as Time Machine. As you haven't specified a backup software, I presume Time Machine, in which case the preferences should have been transferred. If you have used other backup software, make sure that the preferences have been backed up and restored correctly.\nWith regard to the drivers, these should have installed automatically too, unless restoring from backup restored the drivers too. Again it depends how you have backed up, but in conclusion, neither of these situations should have happened, but they're pretty minor and have been solved anyway.\n", "Q: Boot from SD card Can I boot from SD card with speed 95MB/s and capacity 32GB on my MacBook Pro (early 2011)?\nHow fast it is?\n\nA: Yes - I install restore images and emergency boot images on to SD cards as a matter of routine. You should have no problems booting from these storage SD cards due to the SD card or the OS itself.\nThey don't boot as fast as spinning hard drives in my experience as the cache there seems to do a better job than the controller on the cards. I generally get 60 MB/s or faster cards as they seem to be fast enough for the tasks I run.\nOnce the OS loads, it's quite snappy for normal use as the system RAM does a very good job of caching data for many aspects of normal operation. SD cards are a large step below SSD in terms of performance but they are substantially less expensive and designed for a different workload.\n", "Q: How to get Cmd-Tab (Mapped to Alt-Tab) in a Parallels Windows VM to cycle just Windows Apps?

How do I get it to just be Windows?\n\nA: To disable the OS X system keyboard shortcuts while the focus is on your VM, just change the setting under Shortcuts labelled \"Send OS X system shortcuts\" to Always.  This will send all keystrokes only to the VM when it has the focus.\n\n\nA: This has moved again in Parallels 13.

One via HDMI and the other via TB or USB 3.0.\nThe Mac Mini doesn't have a Mini DP that I can see, but from what I've read it seems like TB can act as one? I have the option of TB daisying through a Drobo 5D. The GPU is integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000.\nCould the 2nd monitor be connected via TB >> Mini DP >> {VGA or DVI} adapter?\nIn time, I'd like to add a Wacom Cintiq 22HD touch (DVI) as a 3rd (and the primary) monitor. I'm a bit confused as to how that could work.\n\nA: Dual yes natively, Triple not without USB adapter one of the displays.\nYou can look over these two articles:\n\n*\n\n*Apple Thunderbolt Adapters: Frequently asked questions (FAQ) - HT5309\n\n*Thunderbolt ports and displays: Frequently asked questions (FAQ) - HT5219\n[Item 23] of the HT5219 article is most relevant3:\n\nQ23. How do I connect my Mini DisplayPort monitor or monitor using a Mini DisplayPort adapter to my Thunderbolt-equipped Mac when I have other Thunderbolt devices connected?\nWhen connecting a Mini DisplayPort display or a display using a Mini DisplayPort adapter to a Thunderbolt peripheral (except as described in question 24), make sure the display is connected at the end of the Thunderbolt chain. You can use only one Mini DisplayPort device in the Thunderbolt chain.\nNote: Systems with more than one Thunderbolt port, like an iMac, can have more than one Mini DisplayPort monitor or monitor connected with a Mini DisplayPort adapter connected as each Thunderbolt port can support one Mini DisplayPort display.\n\nItem #18, footnote 4 explains that you only get two monitors with the Late 2012 Mac Mini using Thunderbolt and/or HDMI. To add a third, you'll need a USB adapter for the one that has the fewest pixels / slowest refresh rate requirements. Perhaps you can get a newer (or used but more capable) Mac when it's time to run the Wacom Touch.\n\nMacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012), MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012), and Mac Mini (Late 2012) computers can use an HDMI-compatible device on it's HDMI port while using one Thunderbolt display, or they can use two Thunderbolt displays.\n\nYou'll want to use either a thunderbolt to the exact adapter for each monitor rather than chaining two adapters together if at all possible.\n", "Q: Does supervised device mode prevent restore on another computer in recovery mode? I know this is a long post but please bear with me:\nI have an iPad Mini (A1429) / 7.0.6 which has been wiped, and set up as supervised and locked to my individual laptop with Apple Configurator 1.4.3\n\nI have a custom app (enterprise licence) that the iPad is locked into using the supervise pane in Configurator.\n\nNow, according to the documentation I've read, supervised devices automatically disable the ability for activation-lock to be used by the end-user of the iPad (I'm assuming to prevent disgruntled employees locking iOS devices with personal apple IDs). \nMy assumption is that because of the activation-lock prevention, supervised mode should prevent the iPad from synchronising with any other computer - especially if the device is stolen, so I tested this theory...\nI plugged the iPad into another computer running iTunes. 'This device is supervised by another computer'. Working as expected. \nSo I placed the device into recovery mode, then plugged it into iTunes, which detected an iPad in recovery mode. I proceeded to restore the iPad, and it got half-way through the process before realising it was supervised, and bounced me back into the locked app. This worked as expected too.\nThen I placed the device into recovery mode a second time, plugged it into iTunes which detected an iPad in recovery mode, and then tried to restore the iPad a second time.\nThen something happened I didn't expect. The restore worked. And it presented me with the welcome screen. And it didn't present me with any activation-lock particulars. I was left with a pristine restored iPad free of all restrictions, pass-codes and activation locks.\nMy question to you all: IS THIS A BUG? or is this standard behaviour that is allowed by apple? Because I would assume that there are supervised devices out there that admins don't want wiped by another computer.\n\nA: I think the answer to this question is No, supervised mode does not prevent restoring on another computer when put into Recovery Mode.\nWhen tested, in recovery mode, it acted like the device wasn't supervised at all.  It proceeded with restoring back to defaults as if it was nothing.\nBUT, a strange thing happened when the iPad was plugged back into the original machine that put it into supervised mode - the iPad went back into recovery mode. I opened up Apple Configurator and it started a \"refresh\" process.  This seems to be the same thing as preparing a device, as it restored it back to what it was like after putting it into supervised mode in the first place.  During this refresh process, it re-installed iOS 7.1.1 and re-applied the profile that was setup initially with Apple Configurator.\nTested with an iPad 2\nApple Configurator 1.5 (424)\nMac OS X 10.9.2\n", "Q: How can I remove an autocomplete suggestion from Safari's address bar? A site that I visit frequently used to be located at:\nhttp://www.site.com/sub/dir\n\nBut now it's just located it:\nhttp://www.site.com/sub\n\nThe problem is, I visited the original location so often that Safari suggests it as the Top Hit and autocompletes it, even though it no longer exists (it returns a 404). So I start typing http://www.site.com/sub... and Safari fills in the rest with the old URL that no longer works.\nHow can I remove the old URL so Safari no longer autocompletes it? I already went and found the URL in my history and deleted it, but it still suggests it as the Top Hit.\n\nA: deleting it from my bookmarks worked for me.\nbackstory:  typing yah for yahoo.com autofilled yahooligans.com (safari 8.0.7 on yosemite 10.10.4).\nfix:  found it deep in a sub menu in the bookmarks folder and erased it.  now typing yah fills yahoo.com.  woo hoo and thanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*Start by typing in the website into the Safari URL bar \"example Gmail\".\n\n*Then at the bottom of the suggestions it'll show you Search for 'gmail' in History.\n\n*Click that option and then select all and press delete.\nWorked like a charm for me. \n\nA: *\n\n*Open Safari.\n\n*From the “History” menu, choose “Show All History”.  \n\n\n*\n\n*keyboard shortcut: ⌘ Y\n\n\n*In the Search field in the top right corner, enter the web site you want to remove.\n\n*In the list of search results, click on the web site you want to remove.  \n\n\n*\n\n*To select multiple sites, hold the command ⌘ key while clicking on the sites you want to delete.  Or, to select a range, hold the shift key, click the first item to delete, then click the last item to delete.\n\n\n*Press the Delete key on your keyboard.\n\n\nA: Go into your history and delete all visits to the website.

I only deleted the actual String and not the Item.\n\n*Save and close.\n\n*Close Safari and re-open Safari.\n\n\nA: If you don't want to delete all your preferences and history and bookmarks, and instead only delete the saved url (as posed in the original question), then the following shortcut might be helpful: \n\n\n*\n\n*type the following to open safari: ⌘-space, safari, enter\n\n*once safari is open/active, type this to enable searching of history: ⌘-y, ⌘-f\n\n*start typing whatever url you wish to delete from your autocomplete, it will start filtering the displayed list.\n\n*select entries to be removed: (shift + scroll); or just use the mouse.\n\n*press the delete key\n\n\nA: To remove an address from the auto fill listing, click on the ! Mark at the end of the listing. The pop-up menu asking to \"Create New Contact\" or \"Add to Existing Contact\" can be scrolled down further to the option \"Remove from Recents\". This option will remove the address.\nWhy they hid this option is any bodies quess.\n\nA: Alright- I've figured it out. I'm not even remotely bright, but here is the problem:\nThe reason that autocomplete keeps filling in the websites and bringing it up as a \"top hit\"  and suggesting things is because you have a link to that site saved in your bookmark folder. \nStep 1: Delete all the sites from your bookmark folder that you do not want to show up in autocomplete. \nStep 2: Clear all history, restart Safari, and Voilà - Autocomplete shows nothing.\n\nA: Preferences > Search > smart search field: manage websites\n\nA: Go to Settings -> Autofill -> Other Forms, Tap Edit and remove your site and restart browser.

I'm just new with apple gadgets. iTunes only shows ios 4.2. Does it require me to upgrade one step at a time? It took a lot of time if it does. ;(\n\nA: I believe that you have to go in the order of the updates available. Sometimes this makes more sense for Apple to do instead of merging all of the updates into one, at least for smaller updates.

There is then an icon with the subject of the email which, when clicked opens that email (albeit in a new window). \nMight be helpful. \n\nA: Apparently there is no option to copy date directly from mail message, neither in regular view, nor in \"sort by thread\" view.\nThe fastest method that I came up with was to reply to the email message and copy date from quoted part of it and discard draft afterwards\n\nA: You could use the messages show Header to copy that and more or any information from.\n\nOriginalarrivaltime: 26 Feb 2014 14:05:34.0926\n\nYou could use the screen shot of the mail and paste that in notes.\n\n\nA: As you mention that you use the date to find the message later another method is also possible.\nIf you use a Cocoa app (e.g. TextEdit) for the todo list you can make a link to the actual message such that you don't have to search anymore.\nThis is done through the message-id of the message, found in the raw source. This old hint explains how it works, and here an Applescript is shown that copies the message id of a selected message to the clipboard. \nThe Applescript looks as follows:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set _sel to get selection\n    set _links to {}\n    repeat with _msg in _sel\n        set _messageURL to \"message://%3c\" & _msg's message id & \"%3e\"\n        set end of _links to _messageURL\n    end repeat\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to return\n    set the clipboard to (_links as string)\nend tell\n\nNow if you paste the link in your todo list in TextEdit you can right click it, hit Open URL and the message will pop-up in Mail.\n\nA: The following Applescript gets the date and time of the selected message and places it in on the clipboard. Copy/paste it in the Applescript editor and hit run to see what it does (make sure Mail is open and has a message selected).\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set theSelection to selection\n    set theMessage to item 1 of theSelection\n    set theDate to date received of theMessage\nend tell\nset theDateFormatted to (short date string of theDate & \" \" & time string of theDate)\nset the clipboard to theDateFormatted as string\nget the clipboard\n\nTo make the script useful you should make a service out of it using Automator and assign a keyboard shortcut to it.\nOr, if you're using a launcher like Quicksilver or Alfred, you can save the script somewhere and launch it using the launcher.

If the network share is not mounted, it will automatically mount when the link is accessed either by Finder or with most native GUI applications (e.g., my iTunes folder is linked this way and starting iTunes will mount the share).\nHowever, if you meant a symlink instead of an alias, you can certainly create the link (e.g., on the command line with ln -s /Volumes/dest /path/to/target) but it will not cause the automount to occur, but rather the directory will just seem to not exist if accessed without the share mounted.\n\nA: Consider setting up an autofs mount point to your remote share. autofs will then mount and unmount the shared drive as required.\nIf you are comfortable with the command time, this autofs set up script can be tweaked to make the required configuration file changes.\n", "Q: Run multiple instances of the same version of Firefox with different profiles simultaneously I have an existing installation of Firefox. I've been using this installation for a long time so theres a lot of data (history, bookmark, browser preferences, addon preferences).\nNow I want to split this data (browser history, bookmarks, some settings) with the result that some data is only accessable by instance #1 and the other data is only accessable by instance #2. I know that I have to delete most unwanted data manually but thats ok.\nMy first thought was to clone the profile but I figured out that there are many spots where the actual profile name is hardcoded. The second possibility I see is that I add another installation of the same Firefox version to my system and transfer the profile to the new installation.\nIs there a way to do that? Or is there an alternative solution?\n\nA: Your question is asking for something technically possible, in that it may be possble to \"split\" data in your profile, and distribute it among other profiles, but it sounds incredibly difficult to do considering what you would you gain doing this manually, as opposed to simply setting up new profiles and entering the data you wish into each new profile, and deleting the data from the other profile.\nTo accomplish everything you're asking for (except this splitting of the original profile data) is largely academic. The basic idea is have multiple profiles, and have multiple instances of Firefox each accessing a different profile. The way you do that is you first set up the multiple profiles, and you can do this by accessing the Profile Manager. Open your /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app and type this at the command prompt:\n /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -profilemanager &\n\nand the window that appears, along with information at the link provided above, will get you started on creating the extra profiles. Once these profiles are created, you can start the first instance of Firefox by clicking the Start Firefox button, and you can then launch your subsequent instances of Firefox using that same command. Again, in Terminal.app type the following:\n /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -profilemanager &\n\nand you will see a second instance of Firefox appear in your dock. Choose the profile you wish for the second Firefox instance, and click Start Firefox. Repeat these steps (pressing the up arrow will display the last command) for as many instances of Firefox that you wish to run, or until you run out of memory.\n\nA: I know this is an old question but it deserves an answer. Since Apple introduced Mavericks they managed to break the ability of running multiple copies of Firefox side by side. I used to have this working on Lion perfectly and since Mavericks it will not work as it's impossible to launch the same application more than once. I spent nearly 5 days on El-Capitan figuring this out as no tutorials out there worked at all and I found a solution that works for me and I am using it everyday running 4 copies of Firefox side by side, each with their own profile, own plugins and they all update separately from each other. My solution will work on Mavericks, Yosemite, El-Capitan and also Sierra which is what I am running on now.\n", "Q: How to add wiktionary as a source to the default dictionary.app?

In theory can someone tell me if I should be able to at least boot from the USB created by following a Mavericks install USB guide ? I suspect HD fail but I don't have a lot to go on. On a pc I can always use what is called fdisk to check the HDD.\nSo in theory I can remove the hard disk and get at least some kind of terminal (fdisk equivalent) or other to try to work out what is wrong with the system.\n[I have tried to use other similar answers but moderators are forcing me to start a new question.]\n\nA: First off: Welcome to Ask Different.\nYes, you should be able to boot off of a USB drive in the way you describe.\nIt shouldn't be necessary to remove the HDD, though (to diagnose, that is). When you're turning on your Mac, you can hold down ⌥ (option/alt) to choose which device to boot from (Where you could select your USB drive). Booting from the recovery partition or a USB drive with the OS X installer on it, will give you access to both Terminal and Disk Utility.\nHaving dealt with disk failure in the past, I would advise you to try running AHT (Apple Hardware Test), if the Mac in question is from before June 2013, or Apple Diagnostics if it's newer. Click on the links for instructions, you won't need to start OS X to get to AHT/AD.\nAHT/AD will be able to tell you if there's a hardware problem. If the HDD is truly busted, there's a chance AHT will stall after having run for 3-4 min (Happened to me) which in itself will \"confirm\" that the HDD isn't working like it should.\nIf you can't even get the computer to boot, obviously, you won't be able to start AHT/AD.\n", "Q: QuickLook file associations Typing $ qlmanage -m plugins will give me a list of QuickLook plugins and their associated MIME type (at least I think it's a MIME type):\nplugins:\n  org.openxmlformats.presentationml.slideshow -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Office.qlgenerator (32)\n  com.adobe.pdf -> /System/Library/QuickLook/PDF.qlgenerator (622.3)\n  com.apple.localized-pdf-bundle -> /System/Library/QuickLook/LocPDF.qlgenerator (622.3)\n  com.apple.iwork.keynote.key -> /Library/QuickLook/iWork.qlgenerator (11)\n  ...\n  public.script -> /Applications/Development/TextMate 2.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/TextMateQL.qlgenerator (1.0 - loaded)public.source-code -> /Applications/Development/TextMate 2.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/TextMateQL.qlgenerator (1.0 - loaded)\n  public.plain-text -> /Applications/Development/TextMate 2.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/TextMateQL.qlgenerator (1.0 - loaded)\n  public.text -> /Applications/Development/TextMate 2.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/TextMateQL.qlgenerator (1.0 - loaded)\n  ...\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the number in parentheses?\n\n*How do I know which plugin will be used by a given file?

(This is also mentioned in View location of a document open in Preview, but that still refers to the old method that no longer works with Preview 7.0 from Mavericks.)\nHowever, after the update to Mavericks, this is no longer possible at least in the Preview app, which now shows a (much less useful) menu for renaming, tagging, and moving(?).\n\nA: If you secondary-click the text for the title (and not the arrow next to it), it should still open the menu:\n\n\nA: I found the answer myself; thanks to your 'it should work' answers, I realized that it has to have something to do with the document itself.  Turns out that I had added this particular PDF to the 'Books' section of iTunes in the past, so the Mavericks update moved the PDF into the iBooks folder.\nThe iBooks folder seems to be handled specially, so that the discussed RMB menu does not appear on books opened in Preview.\nOne can still \"move\" the PDF to another location (e.g., using the new menu), which will (contrary to the old iTunes Books location) actually create a copy of the PDF, and then the secondary click menu works again.\n", "Q: External monitor stopped working after 10.9.2 update I've been using a Dell U2713H display for about a year with a mini-display port to display port cable.\nHowever, after installing the 10.9.2 update, the monitor is going into sleep mode when connected to the MacBook Pro (as it doesn't think it's getting a signal), even though the laptop thinks it's correctly connected.

If I turned the power plug 180 degrees or 360 degrees, it stays cool too.\n\n\nTurning 180 degrees was suggested below by mbabineau and seems to fix the issue every time this happens.\n\nA: Actually it should be RT (room temperature) like all the time. \nCheck the pins to see if one of them is getting discolored.\nThe only reson for your converter to get hot is a bad contact creating a arc, that creates heat.\nMaking sure the plugs sit tight (on both sides) and that none of the contact pins (on both sides) is discolored. Cleaning the pins could not harm.\nUltimately getting a new converter would be a good idea.\n\nA: I found the center pin on my charger was \"pushed in\"...recessed and not protruding like the other 4 pins.  Pulled it out with a needle nose plier & cleaned all contacts. Now working.\n\nA: I also found that spinning it around, 180 degrees, fixed the issue. Not sure why but looking at the female side of the adapter it seems two of the connector pins on one side are closer than on the other side. I also maybe hallucinating. \n\nA: Try disconnecting the adapter from the plug and rotating it 180 degrees.  Not sure why it works, but it works.\n\nA: I just had this happen today - with a new MagSafe (1) power adapter (brick) too.  The brick itself doesn't get hot, nor does the MagSafe 1 plug end.  Only the little adapter that has the 1->2 connection.  I'm assuming it's either that the pins aren't seating right, or that there's dust or something in there that's heating up somehow.  The only reason I have a MagSafe 1 brick  is because I still have a MagSafe 1 MacBook, and want to have something that can charge it.\nI'd really like it if Apple would just sell the cords themselves, without the brick. (like they do for the USB->Lightning/USB-C cables).  Because it's ALWAYS the cord that frays/breaks, while the brick is (I presume) fine.  If nothing else, this is an enormous waste of materials..  I don't know how much of the plastic/coil metal/rare-earth-metals-from-the-transistors-ICs that Apple Recycling can get out of a \"returned\" adapter brick.  But being able to just replace the cord would be wonderful.  Until Apple figures out how to make one that doesn't fray.\n(Is it possible to recycle the chips themselves to extract the rare earth metals somehow?  Or would it be worth it.  Yes, I know (a little) about  the \"rare earth crisis that wasn't\" in 2010 (can't find the PDF now), and I found this written in 2011:\n\"At the present time, there is little to no recycling of rare earth-containing products, except in Japan, but some research efforts have been started, at least in the U.S. It is likely that more research on this topic will be funded by the ROW [\"non-Chinese World\"] national governments. One of the major problems is that although the rare earths are essential components of electronic devices, etc., they only constitute a small fraction of weight/volume of the final product (e.g., a computer). As a result, the percentage is about the same as that of the poorer ore bodies (i.e., ~2%) which are mined today. For cell phones and portable music devices it is much worse, the rare earth magnets weigh less than 0.1% of the device.\"\n(https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/articles/material-matters/pdf/the-rare-earth-crisis.pdf)\nBack to the MagSafe, wasn't the \"fraying issue\"/strain-relief-problems why they switched to the \"L shape\" plug in the first place?  Why did they switch back to the T-shape?\nI've though more than once about just cutting the cable in half and sticking an RCA jack in the middle, and then make a \"bullet-proof-RCA-MagSafe\" connector for the computer end.  (Well, a 3-conductor mini-jack since it has the sense pin in there too)\n\nA: I've had my MacBook Air 11\" for over three years and just today the magsafe L got hot which is why Im even on this thread. I turned my block plus 180 degrees in the same outlet and it stayed cool, I moved it one outlet over it got hot again, I changed to yet a third outlet and it stayed cool. Im no electricity guru but In guessing its the outlet and not my charging unit. I read a few other threads in other places and some say theirs have always been hot and that its normal, I disagree, its not normal to have anything on your computer too hot to touch. Thanks for the ideas, they worked for me. \n", "Q: Can I backup an arbitrary file on iCloud? If I open iCloud in System Preferences, it says I have 5 GB of storage available.  I'd like to use it to back up some zip archives of source code.  Is that possible, or can you only access that storage through specific programs?\nUpdate - I've accepted the answer about the Mobile Backups folder, but I it is not quite what I want for a backup system, so I'm not going to use iCloud for this. If I delete a file from Mobile Backups, it will disappear from the iCloud folder, but I want protection from accidental deletion.  I want plain old file storage. \n\nA: Yes you can — iCloud can be used to sync anything that you wish.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open ~/Library/Mobile Documents and create a folder (call it anything you wish).\n\n*Inside, put whatever documents you would like to sync over iCloud.\n\n*That folder will sync with other Macs (and jailbroken iOS devices, and on the web too if you have a Apple Developer licence).\n\n\nAlternatively, you can symlink a folder on your Mac in to the Mobile Documents folder so that the files remain in their original location.\n", "Q: Teamviewer scrolling speed Back To My Mac recently stopped working for me, so I started using TeamViewer to access my home Mac from the outside world. \nIt works great, for the most part. One thing that is frustrating me though is scroll speed. Regardless of what I use (magic mouse, track-pad), scrolling in the remote computer is too fast. It just jumps from the top of the list to the bottom instantly. I don't see any speed tuning controls in TeamViewer, and when I'm connected remotely there are no mice or track-pads displayed in System Preferences, so you can't adjust speed there either.\nCan I slow down the scroll when my network connection has delays to avoid over shooting?\n\nA: I have a temporary solution. You can install \"Smart Scroll mac\" and add specific setting for Teamviewer like follows (all other settings=off).\n\nThen, you can use the trackpad in teamviewer normally. Btw, I recommend you buying this app. \n", "Q: Removing IMAP mail on iPhone not visible in Outlook trash If I remove an IMAP-configured mail from a custom-domain (I've bought it via a domain-registrar), it should throw it in the trash-bin. However, these deleted mails are not visible in Outlook 2010.\nAm I missing something, or is this a bug?\nThe mails I've deleted last (about 3 of them) are still visible in the trashbin on the iPhone, the others (about 20 or 30 of them) are gone.\n\nA: Make sure that the messages are not being trashed into the generic mail trashcan on the phone.

Depending on which R distribution you install it might run just fine from an Application bundle or you will just have to adjust your $PATH variable to place the executable files where they can be found.\nYou probably have a more specific install error that's causing your issues.

The posted commands are quite advanced, however plenty of them are copy&paste commands which indicates some pseudo-hacker (with actually little knowledge) who is trying to install trojan on your system.\nFind the explanation for history commands below:\n\n\n*\n\n*1: It removing files from Trash. Maybe clearing some evidence after downloading something.\n\n*2-12: Accessing Downloads folder with a bit of trouble. Half of these commands are mis-typed, so maybe the person was in hurry or stressed out.\n\n*13-14: Finding all files which belong to an unknown user (for unknown reason).\n\n*15-20: Struggling to access your passwords in KeyChains, but most of the commands are mis-typed. This indicates very little knowledge how to use the basic shell commands. It seems he tries to access folders such as /Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/Automator, /Library/Keychains, but fails.\n\n*21: There is no command sha.\n\n*22-23: Struggling to see your processes.\n\n*24-29: Struggling to check all the system users, however present shell prompt in 25-27 indicates that these commands were copy and pasted from some hack tutorial.\n\n*34-39: Checking network configuration.\n\n*41: Disabling auto updates for Google apps.\n\n*40, 45: Log-in to remote host.\n\n*47: Checking your non-Apple kernel extensions.\n\n*48-49: Checking your non-Apple loaded jobs. Repeating the same command without sudo could indicate that the user didn't have root access.\n\n*51: Checking startup items.\n\n*57: Disabling remote desktop agent. Why?\n\n*71-72: How he managed to install htop using apt-get on OS X? I don't know.\n\n*73-164: Checking processes, what's listening on port 80 and the history of last logins.\n\n*165-225: Checking your users and files again.\n\n*228: Indicates the person is from Windows background, as the parameter /i is invalid.\n\n*226-237: Repeating the same things over and over again. \n\n*238-480: Clearing DNS caches.\n\n*241-259: Running Bitcoin client.\n\n*263-264: Pasting code into wrong window. It should be actually:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"ARDAgent\" to do shell script \"say quack\"'\n\nWhich basically on successful run of ARDAgent would run command say quack which basically say loudly \"quack\". This suppose to test if ARDAgent is vulnerable to the attacks, but testing by using Speech Synthesis it's the worse what hacker can do, because the user will hear that and figure it out that something is wrong.\n\n*265: Testing if check_afp is vulnerable by having SUID flag.\n\n\nYour action were correct by disabling SUID for ARDAgent. When you run Disk Utility and Repair Permission, it will automatically restore the right permissions (including ARDAgent), unless it has been modified. The other thing it to keep your system up-to-date and monitor logs and history more frequently.\n\nA: I'm extremely unclear on exactly what's happening. You mention something about a script running at startup in your subject, but then never mention that again. What's going on there? Where are you finding that script?\nThat script would suggest someone playing a joke on you, by making your computer say \"quack\" every time you start up. That's not indicative of malware.\nOn the other hand, a hidden file as you describe is a common malware trick, though I'm not sure why it would only contain \"--purge\" - that isn't a complete command, as far as I know, and the purge command isn't likely to be used for malicious purposes anyway.\nStill, you do have some indication that you're using Bitcoin-related apps, and there has been some Bitcoin malware that has appeared recently.

The IT guy tried reinstalling every version of OS X. Every time he tried installing a new version. Starting from 10.5 to 10.2 everything failed and wouldn't work at all. There was some luck with 10.4 and it started installing but then crashed in the middle of installation about 4 times. \nIt could be a hardware issue, but is there anything that I could do without changing the hard drive?

So I can know for example which folders in ~/Library/ I can delete without sacrificing system stability.\nFor example in my user-lib folder I had stuff like \"MonoAndroid\" from which I know where they came from (xamarin) and from which I know whether I want to delete them, because I'm not using the app assosiated with that anymore.\nI suppose that the user directories are not that of a big problem with deleting stuff, but there is always this one app, that keeps files also in higher dir's (like said xamarin).\nAdditionally, I want to clean up a friend's mac, and since I was not using that, I'd like to have and intuition of \"what belongs where\" and what not.\nIs there a guide or something?\nOr a good documentation about where stuff should go and which folders should not been touched? I searched for that, but did not find anything good, really.\nUntil now I have based my knowledge about osx on knowledge about unix and half knowledge from usage.\n\nA: Unix knowledge will help a lot as long as it is not following Linux or other conventions exactly (Linux is Unix like whilst OSX is a Unix based on BSD)\nSome description is given by Apple in this developer documentation (The link does not seem to be exact but look for the OSX part not IOS) There are several sections which are too long to list here.\nOne is for UNIX-specific directories but I am surprised to see \"/usr—Contains non-essential command-line binaries, libraries, header files, and other data.\" They might be non-essential but removing this will break a lot - you should only change things in /usr/local\nAnother is The Library Directory Stores App-Specific Files The main sections are\n\n\n*\n\n*Application Support -  app data files except those associated with\nthe user’s documents \n\n*Caches - app-specific support files that your app can re-create easily.\n\n*Frameworks - frameworks that must be shared by multiple apps\n\n*Preferences - app-specific preference files used the NSUserDefaults class or CFPreferences API\n\n\nTreat this as a guide as many (Most?) apps do not follow this 100%.\nMono has in the past put things in the wrong place e.g. in /usr/bin Other apps use Preferences not via the API. Other apps use directories in ~/Library itself e.g. Mail.app\n", "Q: What is the biggest disk that can be used in place of the optical drive in an early 2011 15 inch MacBook Pro? The limitation in a 15inch early 2011 mbp is that the hdd should have a height of 9.5mm and that the SATA port only works reliably with drives that connect at SATA 2 speeds (3G bits/sec)\nTo use a hdd in the optical drive you have to use an adapter, of course. The height is easy to verify.\nI'm looking for the drive with the most storage space that will work reliably in this case.\nThere are reports that the 1.5TB hdd by HGST works in this case. Are there any other drives that work?\n\nA: I added an SSD to my Macbook back in 2012, and did a write-up about it here: http://blog.omgmog.net/post/upgrading-my-macbook-pro/\nMost 2.5\" drives should do, the dimensions of these drives is pretty much standardised.\nIf you're putting a HDD fitted using an adapter in the old optical drive bay, it won't have the shock detection that the lone HDD bay has.

I am seeing the following behavior on a MacBook Air and an iMac.\nWe have external speakers set up that we connect to via USB > external sound card > speakers. When we initially connect, the audio works as per normal, sounds great. Then after about a minute it mutes completely, and won't turn on unless we reconnect the usb and select it again as the output. It's not iTunes or Spotify because using the volume up and down keys does not make any sound either. \nThe iMac started doing this 4 or 5 months ago and now it has just started on the MacBook Air. This also happens on the MacBook Air when I try to connect audio out to the external display I have connected to it, so I don't think its the sound card, I think it might be OS software related.\nSound panel screenshot:\n\nEdit:\nSome more info - when I switch between the two USB audio outputs in the sound panel, I get a short flicker of sound before it cuts out again.\nAnother edit: \nTurning off Bluetooth and WiFi had no effect - the problem still persists\n\nA: I have problems with the Alesis M1Active 520USB speakers. After an undetermined amount of time they just stop working. Switching to internal speakers works fine. A reboot fixes it...but that's painful. The easier solution I've found is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change your sound source (option clicking the sound icon is the quickest method) to Internal Speakers.\n\n*Unplug the speakers\n\n*Open a terminal and run this command, which restarts the Core Audio Daemon: sudo killall coreaudiod\n\n*Plug the speakers back in\n\n\nMaybe it will help you too.\n", "Q: Applescript: Comparing variable to string is failing I have an applescript that gets a list of items and then iterates over them:\ntell application \"GeekTool Helper\"\n    set names to name of geeklets\n\n    repeat with currentName in names\n        if (currentName is equal to \"Top_CPU_Processes\") then\n            display dialog \"found it\"\n        end if\n        return currentName\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nThe names variable gets set to an array of strings properly.

In other words, you don't directly get the value, you get a pointer to the item in the array. You have to convert the item reference to its actual value to compare it.\nTry:\nif ((currentName as string) is equal to \"Top_CPU_Processes\") then\n\nAlso, if you are using Script Debugger, it's a lot easier to see what goes on with the script, it has much much better debug capability than the Applescript Editor.\n", "Q: iOS speed tracker app We all know running tracker apps, such as Nike Running, RunKeeper, Runtastic etc. But i need app with a bit difference in functionality.\nMy ideal running application should track and report it to me (by voice) my speed every 30 seconds or 100 meter.

I installed Alfred through homebrew-cask. I want to disable Spotlight and let Alfred be opened with Cmd+S.\nThe first Terminal-based solution I tried was unloading Spotlight with sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist. However, this makes homebrew fail with \"couldn't get the client port\", and it's known.\nThe second one was to change Spotlight shortcut by accessing System Preferences -> Spotlight and disabling the option \"Spotlight menu keyboard shortcut\". It worked.\nWhat I still don't like is that this solution isn't portable, and I can't add that to my dotfiles. Also, Spotlight still runs, but I think I will have to deal with it because I need homebrew to work.\n\nA: Alfred requires Spotlight to function properly.\n\nAlfred relies on the same OS X metadata index as Spotlight. As such, it's important for you to let Spotlight run on your Mac to maintain an index of the files on it.\n\nhttp://support.alfredapp.com/kb:spotlight\nThis answer to a similar question provides a shell command to stop Spotlight's GUI only, which will disable Spotlight's shortcut.\n", "Q: FileVault security hole when used on SSDs I just woke up to the fact that it looks like user data can be leaked when using FileVault and Migration Assistant on an SSD on a new Mac when following the default prompts.\nWhen I set up a new Mac, it encourages me to \"Transfer Information to This Mac\" early in the process, before I'm allowed to enable FileVault.  This is OK on an HDD because even though I'm copying my data to the new Mac in the clear, FileVault will eventually overwrite all of it with encryption.\nOn an SSD, however, it's impossible to overwrite data securely:\n\n... the Mac's \"Secure Erase Trash\" function leaves 2/3rds of a file recoverable.\n\n— Mac fail: SSD security\n\n... it is almost impossible to securely delete an individual file on an SSD, because the way that SSDs write and delete files is scattered, and a user has no control over what an SSD is doing where. If that's the kind of security you're looking for, your best bet is encryption ...\n\n— Ask Ars: How can I securely erase the data from my SSD drive?\nSo by the time I'm allowed to enable FileVault, it's too late.  Even worse, I can't securely wipe the drive before selling the computer later:\n\nWith OS X Lion and an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault 2 encryption when you start using the SSD drive.\n\n— Mac OS X: About Disk Utility's erase free space feature (support.apple.com/kb/HT3680)\nSo it looks like the solution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Skip the Migration Assistant when prompted.\n\n*Create a new user account.\n\n*Run Software Update to completion to generate more entropy before enabling FileVault in order to mitigate this \"worst-case scenario, in which\nthe PRNG has only been seeded with the least amount\nof entropy\" — Inﬁltrate the Vault: Security Analysis and Decryption of Lion Full Disk\nEncryption (eprint.iacr.org/2012/374.pdf), page 9.\n\n*Enable FileVault.\n\n*Run the Migration Assistant.\n\n\nI'm assuming that even though FileVault is still encrypting the disk before I run Migration Assistant (my computer tells me it has 36 minutes of encryption time remaining) that all new writes made by Migration Assistant will be encrypted and thus my data will never touch the NANDs in the clear.\nDo you agree with the problem and my solution?\n\nA: Your making a test user account with a short name different than the eventual user to be migrated is sound.\nIn practice, you will in time over write more and more of the data, but if you have the time to first establish a file vault key and have the drive completely encrypted before copying any sensitive data, you have a more secure system and can know that the data can be sanitized cryptographically as opposed to being over-written or actually erased.\nYou'll want to look for these lines in the diskutil cs list output to know it's ready for the start of data migration:\n|       Conversion Status:       Complete\n|       High Level Queries:      Fully Secure\n|       |                        Passphrase Required\n\n\nA: Encryption After Transfer: Lowest Risk\nWhile you run the Migration Assistant, there is no additional security risk imposed by the encryption beginning after data transfer commences. In fact, this reduces the physical security risk through the following mechanism: \n\n\n*\n\n*The longer the device is unencrypted, the longer it is susceptible to physical security threats (theft, James Bond), thus the greater the risk.\n\n*The longer it takes to transfer the data, the longer the device will be unencrypted. Thus it follows logically, that the longer it takes to transfer the data, the greater the risk.\n\n*The full-disk encryption process takes a while. It takes even longer if you are writing data at the same time due to i/o limits and CPU capability, unless you have a supercomputer.\n\n*The data transfer process takes a while. It takes longer if it is writing to an encrypted disk; and even a minor difference could be statistically significant in a threat and risk assessment.\n\n*Therefore, the faster the disk gets encrypted, the lower the risk; and the faster the data gets transfered, the lower the risk. \n\n*And therefore, the lowest security risk is offered by the current procedure: transfer the data first, then encrypt the disk. \n\n*This procedure presents lower risk than any procedure that would take more time, especially because as long as the computer is on and the encryption secrets are stored in active memory, the computer is wholly susceptible to a sophisticated threat agent. \n\n\nSecure Erase Unnecessary with Full-Disk Encyption\nSecure Erase provides no benefit when used on an SSD with full-disk encryption, because of how data is stored. But any potential benefit from using Secure Erase on any disk with full-disk encryption, could never be very large because no data would be retrievable without the encryption secrets. If the secrets are obtained by a threat agent, then the whole disk has been compromised. \nWithout full-disk encryption, files can be recovered from an SSD, sometimes, by a sophisticated theat agent, and not a script kiddie, at least not today. This is different from HDDs where for the past decade script kiddies and five year olds have had the tools readily at their disposal to easily recover deleted data from unencrypted HDDs. \n\nA: Here's a secure way to prevent unencrypted data from being written to the SSD: install your system and migrate onto a separate drive, being a USB hard drive, second SSD, etc. Once FileVault is enabled and unencrypted data is wiped, then image the drive over to your SSD. Now wipe the original drive.\nA less secure but easy way is to manually trim the SSD using fsck. This will make the unused space appear to be all zeros to anybody reading the data out from the OS. They would have to either tamper with the drive firmware or remove the flash from the drive to get around this. Eventually, with use all the data on the drive will be overwritten.\nTo answer your second concern, the manufacturer provided secure wipe utility/boot disk will ensure all your SSD data is erased, either by commanding all the flash to be physically erased, or by destroying always-on encryption keys (iPhone style).\n", "Q: Installing two DDR3 SO-DIMMs as non-matched pairs in a MacBook I've just upgraded my girlfriend's MacBook (I think it is a 2011 Model, one of the last white plastic ones) to Mavericks, and it has slowed down significantly. I'd like to upgrade the RAM on the MacBook to get it running faster. Currently, it has a total of 2GB installed in two separate RAM slots. \nIf I take one of these DDR3 modules out, what are the performance implications of replacing it with a bigger module to run alongside the remaining 1GB module? \nOr should I make sure that the RAM modules are installed in pairs?\n\nA: In a testing lab with unlimited funds, matching RAM (matching CAS, the controllers and the size perfectly) can benchmark faster than non-matched RAM of equal total size.\nIn the real world, you get a max of two RAM slots on the MacBook line and most people don't a) wait on their RAM for any significant amount of time ever b) don't throw away good RAM just because it doesn't match another chip they might put inside. (Also, I'm not saying no one waits on RAM, but that the matched vs unmatched situation doesn't cause people to wait)\nFor MacBook that are now vintage (especially the plastic MacBook with the removable batteries in black and white case) - the VRAM was part of the RAM and having matching chips was actually noticeable when you didn't get it right. Games might even be unplayable vs playable in some cases. \nFor anything Mac that is Unibody (not with a removable battery / frame is solid Aluminum) - just buy the most RAM you can afford from a vendor that will accept a return within a week if you mess up picking the right CAS latency and it doesn't work when you insert it. I run Mac Mini servers hard with constrained RAM and just buy a pair of 8 GB sticks for each pair of Macs. They come with 2x2GB so the macs have 10 GB of RAM and there is no measurable speed difference between a matched 8 GB and a non-matched 10GB and since the initial 2 GB stick is free I would never go with a pair of 4 GB sticks in that computer.\nAs a rule of thumb - adding more total but unmatched memory is always faster than adding less total matched memory on aluminum case Apple products released between 2009 and 2014. (And let's exclude the Mac Pro since that can have enough RAM slots and CPU to complicate the generalization I just made)\n\nA: Matched pairs is the optimal configuration.\nHowever, you will still see a performance increase by adding more memory. It is important to note that an increase in RAM ,whether in matched pairs or not, will give a much bigger performance increase than a move from unmatched pairs to matched pairs.\nReally, the matched pairs issue only happens when there is an option of two sticks of size 2X, or one stick of size X. \nIn your current scenario, having an unmatched pair is fine, and will still lead to a good performance increase.\n\nA: First of all, even 3GB of RAM is not enough for OSX (and I'm not talking only about Mavericks), you should get 8 GB (2x4GB) to have the Macbook work smoothly, without sending data to a swap file on the HDD (which has a significant impact on performance). Also, you can use 'purge' command to clean up inactive memory.\nNow, back on the memory modules question. You don't have to worry about the performance loss of not having two of the same sized modules. You won't notice any difference. Dual-channel doesn't offer too much of an improvement, but having more RAM in your system is.\n\nA: Matched pairs is an opitmal configuration - but really, I'd get a 4 or an 8GB SO-DIMM. You'll see a nice speed increase and unless you are running a lot of memory intensive apps you will generally not need to concern yourself with matching the SO-DIMMs.\nAlternatively if you take it into a shop and have it done for you there, they MIGHT give you a credit for trading in the two 1GB DIMMs and you could put a couple of 4GB modules in (I like to go with 8GB minimum these days, if at all affordable) which would be a nice memory AND speed boost.\n", "Q: Installing an SSD in a MacBook Pro mid 2010 but OS X is on an external USB HDD The HDD in my MacBook Pro failed so I followed some online instructions, and as I had a spare external USB HDD I ended up with the latest OS X Mavericks on the external HDD. \nIt was all done by Apple over the internet. The MacBook will now only work with the external HDD. I have a new SSD that I want to fit in the MacBook and have all the files on the current external HDD transferred to the SSD. When I restart the MacBook I want it to boot from the new internal SSD.  However, I am a bit stumped with all the various instructions so can someone give me an easy guide i.e. step-by-step?  I want the MacBook Pro configured as if it was new, i.e. with all the necessary software on the SSD. I have Time Machine backups, I have an USB enclosure. The SSD is a Samsung 840 Pro 512 GB.

So put in the SSD and power on the Mac, then — immediately — hold down ⌘+R and wait for at couple of seconds until the Apple logo appears. It might also be a spinning globe logo in some cases.\nWhen it finishes loading, you should get a desktop with \"Install OS X\" among the options.\n(If this doesn't happen, you don't have a recovery partition and in that case just use the OS disc you have)\nThen open Disk Utility and make sure that the SSD is visible to the MacBook. If so, format it with 1 partion and HFS+ (Journaled, case-insensitive) as filesystem.\nThen proceed to install OS X and select the SSD as destination. This will give you a clean version of OS X on the SSD. After that you can move the files from the external drive.\n\nTo the Apple-certified technicians that I know are here sometimes, please correct me if I'm wrong :)\n\nA: I think it could be done easily:\nwith the mac running from your actual external HDD, connect the new SSD to usb either with a sata->USB cable or an enclusure plus cable.\nStart DiskUtility in Utilities: partition/erase the new SSD to. GUID Partition Table and. Mac OS Extended (journaled).\nThen start a cloning app like Carbon Copy Cloner (trial will do it I think), and make a clone from the HD to the SSD (include the RecoveryPartition).\nThen resta the mac while holding the Alt/option key: select the new SSD. When everything is OK, shutdown the mac and open the mac, put the SSD in the startup disk bay.\n", "Q: How to Page Up/Down on Anker Bluetooth Keyboard?

I have a new iPad air to replace my old iPad 2.\nI'm from a PC background but love Apple phones and tablets and have always wondered, from a performance point of view, would it be better to restore the new Air from a backup of my iPad 2 or start anew? There aren't many settings I'm bothered about keeping.\nThere's no way I'd every backup windows and restore it onto a PC :)\nThanks,\nChris.\n\nA: There different backups at play here:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes backups: saved to local disks, configured in iTunes.\n\n*iCloud backups: saved to iCloud, contain more information than iTunes backups, like home screen and app organization.\n\n\nBoth types of backups are often blamed in troubleshooting. But the iCloud backup is especially useful because it has the home screen and app organization. If you have a lot of apps, or you are particular about the way they are laid out on the homescreen, restoring an iCloud backup to a new device is an excellent solution. (Personally, this is what I do when I get a new iOS device.)\nPasswords will transfer between devices if you use iCloud Keychain. \nThere are numerous downsides to starting from scratch on a new device:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll miss out on your old settings that you won't even remember having set, or why, until you're already suffering from not having them.\n\n*You'll have to endure downloading your apps manually from the App Store, and chew on the anxiety and worry of wondering if you've forgotten to download one of your most beloved apps, like Flappy Bird.\n\n*The time you'll spend configuring your new device from scratch will never pay off, because it is categorically easier for your brain to cognitively consider changes based on your previous settings, than on arbitrary default iOS settings that you should not want to and most likely do not know off the top of your head.\n\n\nThe potential downsides of restoring an iCloud backup seem less:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you had a lot of apps on your old device, it could take longer than you're willing to wait for them to all install on your new device. But this is only relevant if you would like to downsize the number of apps you use. Otherwise, this is not a downside.\n\n*There is a relatively insignificant chance of corruption during the backup/restore process and an additional relatively insignificant change that your previous device was running poorly due to some configuration that may be carried unto the new device via the restore process.\n\n\nVerdict: If you aren't interested in spending a long time reconfiguring the device from scratch, perform an iCloud backup on your old device and restore unto the new one to save time. After all, time is money.\n\nA: There is no reason to restore from your backup unless you want the apps and some settings (i.e. most passwords don't transfer) that you had on your old machine. \nI've had Apple Store employees mention erasing my device and not restoring from backup as a last ditch effort for some issues, but, after trying it the first time and taking a few days to get it back to form, I don't do it anymore because they weren't sure it would help and I do like retaining as many settings as I can.\n", "Q: Connecting a 2009 Macbook to a TV with video and sound output I would like to connect my late 2009 white Macbook to my TV, with support for video and sound.\nI thought I could use the Mini DisplayPort for that purpose, but unfortunately, Apple's website says that:\n\nThese Apple computers supply only video signals over Mini DisplayPort:\n(...)\n  MacBook (Late 2009)\n\nI found this product from another question on Stack, but considering the price and the negative comments of that product, I'm wondering if there are cheaper/better solutions?\nMy TV is a recent Samsung TV with classic ports (USB, HDMI...).\n\nA: The product you are considering retails for $69.99, Amazon is showing me one for $50 + shipping. This type of equipment is generally very sensitive to movement, easy to damage and easy to get annoyed with. Consider the manufacturing cost of that product, against how much you will pay. It seems the markup outweighs the value.\nHave you considered Apple TV? You get a dedicated, more reliable, better device for $100, and it takes up less room than a MacBook combined with a cable adapter that looks like a homemade incendiary device.\nVerdict: Buy an Apple TV.\n\nA: There are very few options for non-AirPlay casting to a non-Apple TV device. But I have found this:\nMirror for Samsung TV 4+ \nby AirBeamTV BV\n(Get the free trial 1st to see if it works, link is in the apps description)\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mirror-for-samsung-tv/id1107644799?mt=12&ign-itsct=1107644799-1107644799&ign-itscg=0176&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\nYou'll need the Audio Driver as well (link is in the apps description).\nThe only caveat is to make sure your Samsung TV qualifies: \n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward.

UE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nHopefully this works for your 2009 MacBook.\n\nA: Since this question has risen from the ashes, @OP had the right idea. Before I had a Mac with audio over the video port, I used an adapter like this to get simple HDMI out: \nhttps://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=5969\nI now have a 2012 MacBook Pro which does do audio over the mini display port, so I use a much simpler adapter now.

I want to set up a free solution in OS X for a universal ‘autosave’ function (given Apple’s own solution is limited to only a few apps - at least for now), and let Dropbox do my file versioning and backup for me.\nI've tried out the (paid) app ForeverSave, (formerly known as freeware ‘EverSave’), and it doesn't actually do a straight 'perform Cmd+S' so much as saving a COPY of the file into its own ‘Library’ in a folder somewhere on the mac (clogging up the hard drive unnecessarily), and as aforementioned, Dropbox already does my versioning for me.\nI’m sure there’s a free way to do it via scripting + scheduling.\nSo I need to set a simple script - to just perform ‘Cmd + S’, to run (from startup onwards) once per minute, and within the script code (or just somehow), to set app exceptions (like browser apps where Cmd+S would not be welcome and get in the way), so that it only triggers in apps you actually to autosave in.\nHow would this be done?\n\nA: Dealing with the same problem myself (especially needing effective autosave for excel for mac, which is most definitely broken in Mavericks) - I just started the \"ForeverSave 2 (version 2.1.2)\" trial on my Mavericks-running 2011 15\" mbp and it seems to both force a cmd+s save of the excel document I'm working on and also save a copy to its library.  This does lead to some excess clutter but it has options to 1) keep the total number of backups for a certain file less than X amount (you specify amount), or 2) to automatically delete backups older than X number of days.  It does actually force a cmd+s, which is great - I tested several times by typing something, letting the document sit slightly longer than the ForeverSave auto-save time window, force-quitting excel or turning off my computer, and upon re-opening the file my new data was still there, without me having ever manually saved.  It only does this when the document is the active window, however so if you type something and then go start working on another document, it will not auto-save that first one (unless the autosave timer just happened to go off in the split second between you finishing typing and going to another window).  Only really seems like a problem if you make the autosave window very long (i.e. I could image if it was set to 3 hours I might work for two hours, navigate to another window, and then have a problem that quits excel, with no autosave ever happening) - to compensate I just set the autosave window to 2 minutes, and am having Foreversave delete any backups that it has after they're a week old, so it's library stays small.\nSilly that we have to pay $20 for software to do something so simple, but at least it seems to work.\n\nA: From my own experience I'd be wary of trusting Dropbox's versioning. I'm not sure what schedule they use, but the one time I tried relying on it, the last saved older version it had of one of my files was from a backup months before.\nAs to your question, I'm not sure you can do it the way you want to do it, but why not simply use Time Machine but change the save interval to 120 secs (by default its at 3600 secs). You do that by editing the plist here:\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto.plist\n(Tip: don't edit the original. Copy and move or rename the original for safekeeping).\n\n", "Q: Play a sound when another application outputs to console I currently have a program that I can't get the source-code to so I'm trying to find another way to do what I need.

I find Keynote 6 in Mavericks to be both a step backwards and a step forwards from Keynote 5. It has some neat new transitions and all, but the iOS-ification (simplification) of the interface, as well as the removal of some key items in the Export to Quicktime command (can't set the exported movie to loop; exports into .m4v format, for instance,) make me want to throw it in the bin. What I am most concerned about, however, is that once Keynote 6 is installed, it appears to hijack the launch services app/doc binding.\nWhen I click on a Keynote document, (version 5 or 6,) Keynote 6 opens as expected. If I 'Get Info' on a Keynote 5 document and use Open with: to select Keynote 5, (either by selecting Keynote 5 from the pulldown list, or by choosing Other... and selecting Keynote 5 from within the /Applications/iWorks folder, that document will open in Keynote 5. This is normal and expected.\nDisturbingly, the Change All... button, which is supposed to set the app/doc binding for all .key files, does no such thing when I set a doc to Keynote 5! No .key documents open in Keynote 5 after I execute this command.\nEven more disturbing is that at some random time, the specific .key files I individually associated with Keynote 5 will lose this association and revert to opening in Keynote 6!\nI've rebuilt the launch services database, verified permissions, etc. This was happening before 10.9.2, as well. I'd like to keep Keynote 6 installed, but it just doesn't seem to play nice.\nAny flashes of insight as to why this is happening?\nSOLUTION\nAfter installation, move the new iWorks apps onto another volume. This prevents the Launch Services 'hijacking' from occurring, allows the use of the new apps, and shuts down the inane update request from Software Update. I've tested this on three separate Macs, and use a Time Machine external drive as the repository for the new apps. Laptop users without perpetually mounted external drives may wish to add the apps into a disk image and mount the image only when needed.\nThis solution provided by user benwiggy at Mac OS X Hints.\nADDENDUM\nWith the release of Yosemite, this problem now recurs.

Apple no longer signs (which includes vouching for the security of) any earlier OS releases (except for old devices, such as an iPhone 3GS).\n\nA: Generally speaking, no.\nApple, last I heard, did not keep old downloads of previous firmware upgrades available for download.\nHowever if you wish to live dangerously other places do. I would imagine it's not strictly legal but there are a number of websites that keep them available for download, for example iosindex.com has a list of firmware downloads that looks fairly complete.\nNOTE I am NOT endorsing this place, I've never used it and can't vouch for the safety of the firmware upgrades they have available. So proceed with caution.\n\nA: I'm going to give you good news!\nYes, it IS possible. Download redsn0w. Get your IPSW from somewhere like ipsw.me (yes, it's legal). Then, modify the IPSW (this part is sorta shakey, Google it. I prefer to keep the baseband the same, but that removes service). Then, using redsn0w, boot your iphone in Pwned DFU mode.

I plan to wipe out one logical drive so that I can dedicate it to a Windows OS (version 7/8). I don't want to boot Windows in a virtualized environment but rather boot up on its own so that I can make use of my MBPs hardware.\nI recently tried Boot Camp Assistant but it wouldn't format a single partition because all of them have been supporting OS X's file system. \nHow do I approach this? Is there some sort of software that will allow me to manipulate the drives and then allow me to painlessly install Windows without the hassle I encountered while using Boot Camp Assistant.\nMy best bet is to backup all the files I have in my other 3 partitions and then delete them so that I can give way to installing a new partition fit for Windows. I'm still adamant on experimenting because of the dangers I might encounter, say for example I might mess up my Master Boot Record and end up in frustration.\nIn short, this is dual-boot question - only with the difficulty imposed by Boot Camp, so I'm just looking for other alternatives/solutions on how to approach it.\n\nA: If you have a bootable copy of the recent OS you can boot from that and instead of using the installer go to the menu and select Disk Utility. That will let you delete partitions at will.\nAlternatively you can boot into Recovery Mode (Command-R during boot, if I recall correctly) and that will also have Disk Utility available to you.\n", "Q: Using an external microphone with iPad Air or the new iPad Mini I have an external USB microphone that works fine with the iPad 3 using the Camera Connection USB adapter and a USB hub for power.

My problem is the wifi internet is not stable and regularly goes out for 4-5 seconds at minimum up to ~40 seconds, although the network stays up. However it is annoying because my macbook does not automatically reconnect, and instead sits there saying nothing is connected when it detects a network doesn't share internet anymore.\nBy regularly I mean 7-8 times per hour I have to manually rechoose the network. On windows 7 the computer stays connected, and I just have to wait while hitting refresh for the signal to come back. I would like to be able to have it stay connected but without a signal like what happens when I am in bootcamp.\nEdit:\n\nAre you sure it's Wifi outages and not a DNS server problem?\n\nI'm sure it's not DNS. I've tried opening firefox in bootcamp (where it doesn't disconnect me automatically), as well as pinging various websites from the console. What happens is the signal is dropped, but not the network. I am still connected to (w/out internet) and see the network while I have no internet in windows.\nIn osx what happens when the signal is lost is that the entire network is dropped as if I was never connected to anything at all. And it does not auto rejoin. I have to manually click the network icon and reconnect, however it sits there for a while after I click moving up and down.\nI assume what is happening is that the signal is not back yet when it happens, so it is trying for several seconds until it comes back. \n\nA: Are you sure it's Wifi outages and not a DNS server problem? If you've been using Safari, check with other browsers – if they get through while Safari doesn't, set OS X to use an alternative DNS server (System Preferences > Network > Advanced…), e.g. OpenNIC.org, OpenDNS.com\n", "Q: Finder shows .dmg is unmounted, Trash refuses to delete it I downloaded a .dmg file for an application, and now after installing the app and unmounting the .dmg I can't delete the .dmg file because Trash says it's \"in use\". Finder shows no mounted .dmgs, yet if I use the lsof command in Terminal and filter for the filename it shows that a process called diskimage is using it. What do I do?\nI should mention that when I initially downloaded the .dmg file to Downloads and tried to open it from there, nothing happened. I clicked it several times and got nothing. My browser was writing a bunch of temporary files to Downloads (I was using an extension to download a bunch of files at once, that was the source of that), so I figured that folder was \"busy\" and moved the .dmg file to another folder. Sure enough clicking on it from there finally got it to mount. I'm wondering if all that clicking with nothing happening earlier actually mounted a bunch of disk images that for some reason are hidden. Could that be possible? Also, I ultimately ended up junking the installed application, but I don't see how that could be a factor.\nI am using OS X 10.6.8.\n\nA: Rebooting should clear all the processes that are using the file and unmount all potentially mounted disk images. Once rebooted, try deleting it again.\n", "Q: Why does my path not get saved even after editing ~/.bashrc? I've added maven to my path, but it doesn't seem to be persisting to the path beyond the lifetime of the terminal application.

I created a Windows 7 install usb using bootcamp successfully but the startup screen is not recognizing the usb on reboot.

Give it a shot.. Hope this helps.\n\nA: According to this Apple Support Communities thread, some USB drives don't work.\n\nNot all USB sticks allow you to make them bootable (apparently).  I initially tried one stick = no luck, so I had this other novelty 8GB stick that looks like a little Darth Vader (I bought it mainly for its looks), however I tried to use Bootcamp setup to make this USB stick bootable and it worked!\n\nTry with a different drive to see if that works.\n", "Q: Every time I enter an url into safari it goes to a previously visited part of it Like I'm trying to go to the homepage of tv-series.me, but it keeps going to tv-series.me/psych-episode-1-blabla even though I literally type \"tv-series.me\" and press GO. But it just keeps going back to that page. Is that normal?\n\nA: It is normal. It allows you to get to pages you previously visited or, if you prefer to visit only the URL you've typed thus far, you simply hit backspace and then enter.\nSafari's autocomplete model is slightly un-ntuitive at first (especially if you're used to shell completion) because it offers not the shortest unique completion but something else which is almost always longer. \nFrom my non-scientific observation, I'd say the algorithm most likely uses the most visited URL which matches what's already been typed or, all being equal, the most recently visited.  Which makes a lot of sense when you think about it AND understand that you can always ignore Safari's guess by either continuing to type or hitting backspace.\n", "Q: Moving an application window to another desktop or screen using the keyboard? In Windows, when I press the windows key + any arrow button the current application window moves. For example: windows key + left arrow key: the application window moves to the left of the display.\nI want to know if this feature is available in OSX. If yes, how do I use it? If it's not a native feature, is there is a free third party application that might enable this feature?\n\nA: Spectacle supports assigning a shortcut for resizing a window to fill the left or right half of a screen and for moving a window to another screen:\n\nAs does Slate:\nbind left:ctrl;alt;cmd move screenOriginX;screenOriginY screenSizeX/2;screenSizeY\nbind right:ctrl;alt;cmd move screenOriginX+screenSizeX/2;screenOriginY screenSizeX;screenSizeY\nalias monitor-macbook 1280x800\nalias monitor-dell 1440x900\nbind up:ctrl;alt;cmd move screenOriginX;screenOriginY screenSizeX;screenSizeY ${monitor-macbook}\nbind down:ctrl;alt;cmd move screenOriginX;screenOriginY screenSizeX;screenSizeY ${monitor-dell}\n\nAmethyst also supports assigning a shortcut for moving a window to another space. throw-screen-2 (control-option-shift-e) moves a window to the second screen and throw-space-2 (control-option-shift-2) moves a window to the second space.\n\nA: Once again BetterTouchTool made my day. You can assign a keyboard shortcuts to move the windows across desktops. In my case I use ctrl+shift+arrow.\n\n", "Q: Does clearing Safari's cookies actually help the iPhone's overall performance? There's an iPhone 4 that has been getting pretty slow lately, so I figured I'd browse a bit about how to fix it. One particular tip several sites seem to suggest is clearing Safari's cookies.\nI am skeptical about this, because, well, cookies are just files that are used when you browse the web. I suppose that clearing the cookies may speed up the browsing experience, but I don't see how can that speed up the overall iPhone performance. In fact, if I have Safari closed, I can't imagine any way in which cookies could affect my iPhone. I mean, it's not like the iPhone is checking my cookies when I am playing Angry Birds or something.\nIs there any truth to this tip? Does it actually help iPhone performance to clear the browsing cookies?\n\nA: You've seem to come across some high-quality bull crap here. No, deleting cookies from Safari will do absolutely nothing in terms of speed anywhere. The only thing it does it reset all of your login sessions for websites. That's all it does. The speed difference even in Safari will be unnoticeable.\n", "Q: iMac external display (EA232WMi) won't sleep I'm using an iMac 11,3 (27 inch, mid 2010) with an external display (an NEC EA232WMi).\nOver the past week or so (beginning just prior to 10.9.2), when the iMac's display sleeps, the external display won't stay asleep. \nIt keeps waking up.\nI can see the power indicator repeatedly going back and forth between the \"on\" and \"energy save\" modes. When it wakes, it shows its usual message about not receiving any video input signal. The iMac's internal display doesn't (visibly) do anything at all.\nIt doesn't seem to be related to any apps-- if I reboot the iMac and leave it there at the login screen until the display sleeps, the same thing happens.\nThis only happens when the display is off but the iMac is still awake. When the iMac sleeps, everything seems normal.\nIf I move the external display to a different Mac (which is also running 10.9.2), the display sleeps normally, so it seems to be specific to the iMac.\nI did an SMC reset and even zapped the PRAM (yes, voodoo) but they had no effect. What can I look at to figure out why the iMac keeps waking the external display?\nAdditional: Wondering if this might be related to an external device, I tried unplugging everything from USB. No change. Turned off Bluetooth? No change.\nUpdate with some requested information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Console logs. All that I get is the following.

Just an idea.\n\nA: These steps will potentially help isolate hardware/software issues. Since the monitor and cables appear to work with another Mac, apparently it's a local hardware or software issue. You can restart and perform a hardware test following these instructions from Apple (complete test takes a few hours, run overnight) by holding d prior to chime on restart, disconnecting peripherals, etc. \nTesting from a clean install on a known working partition will eliminate software. If that works good news! And, I'm sorry, as you're looking at an in place reinstall best case; or clean install... this is the last thing I ever want to hear as a suggestion. :) Have you tried an OS reinstall or clean install?\n\nA: Go to the system prefs -> power options then configure the sleep option.\n\nA: This is a workaround.\nI have a similar problem to the OP. I found that I can make the display sleep and stay asleep via the command line:\npmset displaysleepnow\n\nIn contrast, the external display wakes immediately after sleeping when I use the hot-corner method. Since display sleep problems can have many causes, my general advice is to try different methods of making the display sleep.\n", "Q: keyboard shortcut to jump to the non-whitespace first character in a line control-a is pretty close - it moves the character to the first column. command-left does too.\nif my keyboard had a home key this would likely move the cursor there, but it doesn't.\nsimilar to this question, i'm trying to get vim's ^ behaviour without moving my hands too far. unfortunately alt-m outputs µ instead of giving me the goods.\ni'm hoping for something i can use system wide, i'm not sure if os x has this though. \n\nA: There is no shortcut for it by default.

In the past I stumbled across the star rating selector UI by accident- now I can't find it. \nI have a third-gen Apple TV running 6.0.2. \n\nA: Currently (March 2017) you have to login to iTunes to rate and leave a review. I hope they add this feature to Apple TV soon.\n\nA: I just watched Gladiator for probably the 5th time and, with a tear in my eye, wanted to give it a 5 star rating. I have rated movies in the past on Apple TV but cannot find how to do it anymore. I can't find it on the rental screen, the \"more\" menu, or the menu while the movie is playing. I've also looked to see if it is only available to purchased movies which is not the case. I am left to believe the feature has been removed. I hope I am wrong.\nHowever, I also scoured the internet for an image of someone rating a movie on Apple TV and could not find one, which leads me to believe I am crazy. Maybe were both crazy. Or maybe it's just gone because no one cared about it. \n\nA: Figured it out. In iTunes, rented tab, graphic of movie rented, right click on the picture, select Love or Dislike. Also an option to go to movie in iTunes store. Click on that link and you can choose how many stars and even write a review. SOLVED.\n", "Q: Adobe Illustrator alternative for the Mac?

I just brought a brand new MacBook Pro (mid-2012) and it came with Mavericks installed on it. The previous Mac I had before I got this one had Mountain Lion and it ran my pro tools sufficiently but now I have a better Mac and it's giving me problems: I can't go 2 minutes without it glitching, popping and distorting and having to restart it.\nI need Mountain Lion again — is it possible to go from Mavericks to Mountain Lion?\n\nA: According to Apple, you should not install previous versions of OS X than the version that came with your Mac. Since your Mac came with Mavericks, you should not install Mountain Lion. But if you want ML, then it may be possible with the following caveats.\n\nBoth PowerPC- and Intel-based Macs ship with a certain version of Mac OS X (or Mac OS X Server) on their installation disc(s). You should not install a version of Mac OS X earlier than that which came with your Mac.\nIf you install an earlier (previous) version of the Mac OS X than what was included, your computer may exhibit unexpected behavior such as:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The trackpad or mouse may not respond properly\n  \n*The computer may stop responding\n  \n*Sleep/wake issues may occur\n  \n*The display image may appear to \"shrink\" with black bars around it, may appear tinted, or have other issues\n  \n*Loss of built-in audio\n  \n*Loss of Bluetooth or AirPort functionality\n  \n*May not start up past the Apple logo\n  \n\nSource: Apple KB — Don't install a version of Mac OS X earlier than what came with your Mac\n\nA: Generally no you can't go back. Mac OS 10.8 is going to fail upon trying to boot or install Mac OS 10.8 on to a machine that came with a newer version of OS X.  Since that new Macbooks hardware identifier id is not listed as a supported Mac by prior OS X versions, since it did not exist when 10.8 was released. So when you try to boot 10.8 you will see an error message along the lines \" Sorry this version of Mac OS is not compatible with this Computer\"\nNow with a little hacking of an existing disk that has 10.8 installed you could probably add your new machines hardware id to that list of supported Macs and get it to boot with 10.8, however your new MacBook would be missing some hardware drivers made for current generation Macs so it could be unstable and missing important drivers for graphics acceleration, and the track pad, and who knows what else.\nSo yes if stability is your goal then moving back to 10.8 on this MacBook is not a good idea.\nIf you really need 10.8 and the software you need to work is never going to be updated for 10.9 plus you could look for an older MacBook that will support 10.8. Check out http://www.everymac.com, they do an excellent job of listing which Mac OS versions are supported on any given Mac\n\nA: To save expense of upgrading software, it may be possible to run an older OS than the OS your Mac came with.   \nI have a $2,000 scanner, but the driver only works with OS 10.6.  In 2013, I replaced my mid-2006 iMac with an Apple refurbished mid-2011 iMac with OS 10.8 pre-installed.  At the time there was no scanner driver available for OS 10.8.  \nOn the refurbished iMac, the installer for OS 10.6 would not run.  It gave a message something like \"Sorry this software is not compatible with this Mac\".  However, if OS 10.6 was installed on a partition or external drive using an older iMac, and then that partition or external drive was moved to the refurbished iMac, OS 10.6 ran with no issues on the refurbished iMac.   \nNow I use an OS 10.6 partition on refurbished iMac only when I need to scan something.  When I am not scanning, I start up from my OS 10.8 partition for all my other applications.   (The scanner manufacturer has finally released a driver for OS 10.8 . . .  but wanted $450 for just the driver.)\nI am reluctant to upgrade past OS 10.8 as Adobe CS5 software may then not run.  Upgrading Adobe software is beyond my affordability, so I am hoping I will be able to run OS 10.8 on a newer iMac when I need to replace the refurbished iMac.  As a graphics printer, I've been using Adobe/Aldus software since 1988, and don't want to switch.\n", "Q: What is filling up my hard drive so fast?

After recently found risk for ios 7 device and releasing an update to resolve it, is it a risk to keep ios 6 on iPhone 4?\n\nA: Yes, there is a risk because you're using unsupported software which is never recommended. That's the reason why Apple gave out iOS 6.1.6\nOne of them is the SSL leak which is fixed in iOS 7.0.6 and iOS 6.1.6 \nHowever, you can also install the SSL-fix by Jailbreaking your device (if you did not do this yet). You can use this guide.\nSidenote: If you have an iPhone 4 and not a 4s, as stated in your question I'd use the Jailbreak Fix. iOS 7 killed my iPhone 4. It's too slow.\n\nA: Since there is a known vulnerability and Apple won't let you update your iPhone 4 to 6.1.6 (yet) It is impossible to say there is no risk. \nSo yes there are some risk. \n", "Q: Normal Fan Speed for an early 2011 MacBook Pro I have an early 2011 Macbook Pro and I noticed today, strangely for the first time, that the fan(s) are always running and audible. I have to admit that I usually have some background noise when using that machine but I've noticed the fan noise now that it's quiet.\nI checked the RPMs and they are both (left/right side) at 1995-2000 and CPU temperature is ~36℃ - which all seems like normal readings to me but just to make sure, the fans do run all the time, right and for an idle machine (10.9.2 on it with nothing else running) fans running at 2000 rpms is normal.. or not?\n\nA: Laptop fans are very small compared to their desktop counterparts, and require a much higher speed to displace a sufficient amount of air.\n\n\n*\n\n*2,000 RPM is the MINIMUM speed for MacBook fans, with the max being 6,200 RPM.\n\n*Typical operating temperature of a MacBook CPU is between 35℃ and 85℃\n\n", "Q: Deleted all users with \"dscl . -delete /Users\" I don't know how I put myself in these situations.\nSo I was fooling around with dscl late last night, making and removing accounts, when suddenly I ran dscl . -delete /Users instead of dscl . -delete /Users/someuser.\nSo now I have no users on my machine, all that works is single user and recovery HD.\nWhat do you think is the best way to fix this? It seems to me like doing the re-install from recovery HD will restore the system users and leave my files alone. I've found another answer from a few years back (link) where OP says the installer hanged (hung?) when he tried that. However, he was running 10.6, where I'm running 10.9, and the restore mechanism is different. Has anyone else been in this situation?\nI'm thinking of doing the re-install and, if everything works fine, re-creating my user with the original home folder with DSCL. What I don't know is how safe that is.\nAlso, I don't have a backup of any kind.\nAll that really matters is not losing anything in my home folder. If I have to copy all of my files off to an external HD and do a wipe and install, I'll do it. I'd just like to avoid such extremities if at all possible.\n\nA: Indeed, that should work.\nReinstall using the Recovery HD, then create a new user account with a unique name using the Setup Assistant. Once booted, you can open Users & Groups from System Preferences and create your original user again. Providing you use the same short name, this should prompt you to associate the existing home folder to the new user account.\nHowever, you can't be too careful, and making a backup would always be wise. If you have OS X installed on an external drive (or are willing to install it on an external drive), you can boot into that and use that to obtain the files. Alternatively, you can boot into Single User Mode, mount another drive (mount /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/externaldisk) and copy the files over.\n\nA: Couldn't you delete /var/db/.AppleSetupDone file?  Then the computer should start with that little song-and-dance and create a new user.  Once that is done, you can move the home directories around and reset things as you like.\n", "Q: Should we change the availability date when we resubmit the app in to App Store? Last month(15-Feb-14) I have uploaded an app in to App Store with availability date 20-Feb-14 and my app status was \"Waiting For Review\". Yesterday(1-Mar-14) I got one issue and again I had to resubmit the app in to App Store and my app status is \"Waiting For Review\". My question is Should we change the availability date also when we resubmit the app?\n\nA: There's no need to manage an availability date and it is separate than the review submission process and only is considered once approval is granted for the app to be sold.\n\n\n*\n\n*If your date is in the future, it will sit and wait to go on sale when that future data arrives.\n\n*If your date is in the past, it will go on sale as soon as approval is processed and the store can update the database.\nYou might in the future hold your patch until the first review finishes, since you may have put yourself at the end of the queue by resubmitting. If the first review gets rejected, you still need to resubmit and can bundle the fix then. If the first review gets approved, you can then decide on how long it took and whether you push the change you had before releasing or if you want to release with that issue.\n", "Q: Where are cellular data preferences stored in iOS? In Settings → Cellular (Mobile in UK), settings can be changed regarding mobile data, including per-app switches for all installed apps to enable or disable mobile data.\nWhere are these preferences stored?\nI've looked in /var/mobile/Library/Preferences, but there doesn't seem to be any preferences relating to this. I've searched through the plists for various strings including app names and IDs from the list of per-app settings, but not found anything.\n\nA: The directory you're looking for happens to be /var/wireless/Library/Preferences. This is where the Settings > Cellular settings are stored. The per-application settings are stored in the database /var/wireless/Library/Databases/CellularUsage.db. If you want to add a setting manually, you'll need to add an entry for the application in two tables. The first is bundle_uuid, and you'll need to set the bundle_id field to the friendly bundle name (such as com.developersbliss.Helicopter), and then the macho_uuid field to its UUID (such as DD314675-0AA8-8A84-DB2BB966BAD8) (Repeat this step for each UUID that the application has. In my particular example, there are two UUIDs. Just add another entry to the table for each UUID, but with the bundle_id set the same as before, and with the macho_uuid set to the next UUID the application has.). Then you'll need to make an entry in the bundle_info table with the bundle_id field set to the friendly bundle name used in the bundle_uuid table, and then the flags field set to 0. This will make that particular application be restricted from using cellular data. To enable the application to use cellular data again, just set its flags field in the bundle_info table to 1. Any application not found in this database is assumed to be allowed to use cellular data.\n", "Q: Why is it quicker to search on google app compared to web browser on smartphones When you do a google search , the time taken for the results and the webpages of the result to load is much faster on Google search app compared to web browser for smartphones. What is the explaination behind this ??\nGoogle app\n\nWeb Browser\n\n\nA: Your screen shot shows EDGE networking which is one of the slowest in terms of bandwidth and often also in latency.\nPresumably, the Google app can send just the characters you type to the search engine immediately and get just the results you need to see back.\nThe web page has to redraw the entire page when results start to arrive, so if you are noticing a sustained, long term speedup in one versus the other then you can conclude one of several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The native app sends less data and retrieves less data - but interacts with the same servers (or more precisely - servers with the same speed) on google's side.\n\n*The native app sends the same data as the web app but connects to servers that respond faster.\n\n\nI would guess both are in play. Google is selling you and your searches to Google's paying customers. It doesn't take deep analysis or insight to realize that Google gets more value from you using their native app than it does from you using safari to browse their web search app. It might easily serve Google's interests to invest more money in making you choose the tool that makes it the most money.\n", "Q: Second hand iPhone advice? I'm planning to purchase a second hand iPhone 5s in a couple of days, is there a checklist that I should follow before I purchase the device to ensure that I won't run into troubles later on? Such as iCloud activation lock and such? \n\nA: The most important thing to do before buying any iOS 7 device is check for activation lock.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5818\nI don't want to copy all the steps in case they change, but in a nutshell focus on the text that appears below in a section you need to expand:\nHow do I check for Activation Lock before purchasing a used device?\n\nWhen purchasing an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch from someone other than Apple or an authorized Apple reseller, it is up to you to ensure that the device has been erased and is no longer linked to the previous owner’s account....You will know that a device is ready for you to use when you are asked to “Set up your iPhone\", “Set up your iPad\", or “Set up your iPod” during the device setup process.\n\nYou basically, power off the device and start it and slide to unlock. The Apple document explains in more details what you will see and how to ask the seller to properly unlock things before you take possession of the device. You might also escrow the funds if you can't meet face to face to ensure both parties deliver what they agreed upon.\n", "Q: Can't find \"Find my iPhone\" app on OS X I have attempted all the suggestions listed in Apps on my MacBook Pro but I still can't  find the app I am looking for: Find my iPhone.\nI have checked Applications, Downloads, Spotlight, Finder, and Launchpad.\nI went to download it, iTunes says I have already downloaded it, have tried everything to find it on my computer.

It is sad if iphone screen can only hold off 3 years (-.-\")\n\nA: That looks like a clear case of LCD image persistence which might go away in a few hours or day or might require service to exchange the panel if those changes are permanent. Depending on how long the image was static - you probably won't see the ghosting after it's off for a few hours or the panel gets used to the new pattern you are displaying on those pixels (retaining that image rather than the old one).\nSoftware defects would show up in the screen capture and this is a very common limitation of plasma and LCD displays due to the physics behind how they produce and filter light.\n", "Q: Spotlight in Mavericks does not search Tags - how to enable?

(IE: if you know you are running Spotify for music, you could rule out any active connections that are going to a website with \"spotify\" in the hostname.) After narrowing it down, if you are left with a set of IP addresses instead of hostnames, you could try running the remaining ones through an IP address lookup webpage.\nHere are the commands.

When I login to my Mac, I want to automatically open a new Terminal.app window with a certain profile, say Monitor, that has a startup command and several appearance settings.  I thought it would be very easy to do this from AppleScript or command-line (via osascript), so I can add a script to my login items, but it turns out this is not so trivial after several tries.\nMy current best way is the following AppleScript:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    set origSettings to default settings\n    set default settings to settings set \"Monitor\"\n    activate\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"n\" using command down\n    set default settings to origSettings\nend tell\n\nHowever, I want to know if there's a simpler way to do this without relying on UI scripting (with System Events) or messing around with my Terminal's default settings.\napplescript (osascript) for changing Terminal.app profile seemed promising, but it's for when there's already a Terminal window open.  I have no idea how to create a new Terminal tab or window with its current settings specified.  The do script command, which does create a new window, unfortunately ignores the startup command set in the profile, making me fall back to UI scripting.\nI also found this script: http://blog.azizlight.me/having-fun-with-applescript-and-terminal-app/ which again relies on UI scripting.

This fixed the problem.  However, I still would like to know what the problem was, and if it is possible to fix it without rebooting.  It seems to be a rather disturbing trend that Mavericks is more prone to needing a reboot than earlier versions of OS X.\n\nA: This is probably something obvious that you've checked already, but do you have some wierd proxy settings in the OS or the browser?\nFailing that, run the Developer Tools in Chrome and look at the 'Network' tab - does that show any redirects or anything?

When I type \"monkees\" into the \"Search Library\" box in iTunes, it offers me three things: (A) \"The Monkees\" as artists, and (B and C) the two songs I have by The Monkees. The search dropdown shows, right below the artist name listed on (A), that I have 439 songs by The Monkees. This is wrong: I just have the two. But those two songs both come from compilations, which have the following tags, among others:\nArtist: The Monkees\nAlbum Artist: Various Artists\nPart of a compilation: True\n\nThe number 439 appears to be the total number of tracks with Album Artist = \"Various Artists\" that I have. And sure enough, when I select choose the Monkees artist hit from the search boxes, it shows me not just Monkees tracks, but every Various Artists track, split up by album, and with the two Monkees tracks being nowhere near each other. I'd much rather see just the two Monkees tracks.\nWhat is the preferred way to handle this issue? I believe I have my music collection set up right (say, as described by this page and in a variety of other conversations I've found online), but the current behavior seems silly to me.\nHere are some things I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going to View -> View Options under the Artists view and toggling the Group Compliations box\n\n*Switching to the Songs view and playing with the settings under View -> Column Browser.\n\n*Erasing Various Artists from the Album Artist field and leaving it blank instead.\n\n\nItem #3 seems to work, but it's clearly not standard and so I would expect adopting it as a solution would cause other stuff to break, either now or at some point down the road.\nIs there a clean way to handle this?\n\nA: I only really see two options here.\n1) Get rid of the Album Artists field altogether, select all tracks and Get Info. Set the Album Artist field to blank, meaning song are grouped solely by their Artist and not Album Artists. The songs in the various artists albums will still be linked by the album name if you just want that album.\n2) Create a smart playlist with the filter being Artist is (or contains) \"The Monkees\".

Preview does not receive an entitlement to access the PDF if you just pass it a string to open. From Apple's release notes:\n\nCompatibility Notes\nWhen sending commands to a sandboxed application, such as TextEdit in OS X Mountain Lion, parameters that refer to files must be of an explicit file-like type and not a bare string, or the target application will not be able to access the file. For example, file \"Macintosh HD:Users:me:sample.txt\", POSIX file \"/Users/me/sample.txt\", or the result of choose file would all be acceptable, but the string \"/Users/me/sample.txt\" would not.\n\nWhy does this sometimes work? When you open a file manually, the application retains the entitlement to open it (in Recents, for instance). Therefore, if you try any file you've opened already, odds are it will work, but it won't work on new files.\nTo fix, change your code to read:\n...\n    set srcFileRef to (open POSIX file srcFileString)\n...\n\n", "Q: Can you use an iPhone 5 to call if you have internet service, but no cell service?

I'll need some help finding the next steps to solve this black screen.\n\nA: I tried the PRAM many times and it didn't work. Thank you Reve. Your link solution was the one that worked. Dunno why your solution was down voted.\nI am copy pasting the text:\nIn the three years of using my MacBook Air, I have never had any major problems with it. It was totally reliable, even after I accidentally spilled coffee on it. However, the update to macOS Sierra 10.12.2 ruined its streak, leaving me with a blank screen that only displayed the cursor.\nI initially blamed the update for this, but after I saw no similar reports from other users I started doing some digging. As it turns out, this problem predates Sierra by a couple of years. Apple has not addressed it yet, but, don’t panic: it is pretty easy to fix it yourself.\nIt is not clear what exactly is causing macOS to act up after installing an update, but it rears its ugly head after powering on the Mac. You can try to reboot or reset the PRAM and SMC — the first things that Mac users can try when something isn’t working right — but that will not fix it.\nSo, here is what you need to do. First, you need to shut down your Mac, if it’s powered on. Pressing the power key for a couple of seconds will do the trick.\nNext, you have to boot your Mac in single-user mode. That’s done by pressing the Command and S keys at the same time, right after pressing the power key. If you did it right, you should see a whole bunch of lines on the screen in what is a Terminal-like interface.\n(I’ve seen someone recommend that you reset the PRAM three times before booting in the single-user mode. There is no harm in doing that. Hit the Command, Option, P and R keys at the same time, right after you power it on, and wait until you hear the startup chime for the third time before letting go. Then, quickly press the Command and S keys, to get you into the single-user mode.)\nYou then need to type the following commands:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n/sbin/mount -uw /\nrm -f /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist\nrm -f /var/db/.AppleUpgrade\nreboot\n\nYou will have to press the Enter/Return key after each one. The fifth command restarts your Mac. It will show the login screen. That’s normal, even if you previously bypassed it. Type in your password and you’re back in business.\nYou may run into this problem even after macOS Sierra 10.12.2, but know that you will be able to apply this method again if that happens.\n\nA: There is likely an issue with something specific to your profile. You can verify this by booting into safe mode:\nHold Shift while booting, it will take longer than usual, and eventually the startup screen will say safe mode. This disables a lot of things that run at startup on the system AND in your profile. If you can then get into your profile something that automatically starts is the issue. If not...\nBoot the system from either the install DVD or by holding Command+R (for recovery mode). When you get into recovery mode, use disk utility to repair the disk then repair permissions. Then see if you can get into your profile.\nIf you have another Mac, put it into target disk mode and rename the preferences folder in ~/Library. Reboot and try to get in.\nFailing that you may have to create a new user on the system and migrate your settings and file from the old one to the new one. You should be able to create a new account using the guest login and authenticating as your administrative user in the System Preferences -> Accounts control panel.\n\nA: It happened to me too. I just typed my login password, assuming the login screen was there and I could not see it. That worked like a charm and I booted into my normal Desktop. After a reboot it did not occur again. \n\nA: With FileVault 2 and the new boot system, you can have a lot more going on than just the old standard, black, grey, grey + Apple logo, blue screen sequence.\nApple has an updated KB article covering the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203176 - Troubleshooting startup issues\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204156 - What you see during startup\n\n\nFor you, you'll want to power off the mac and use Verbose Mode to see where the log in process is hanging. Grab a pencil or better a camera to take a picture of the screen when it's stuck - the last few items on the screen will isolate the specific failure you are experiencing.\n\nA: I had similar post-login issue on my MacBook Pro 17\". After logging in, screen in quick succession would gray out top window (pdf file in Preview, as per previous session), show black horizontal bars across whole screen, then go completely black. Sometimes the little rotating icon would show (fixed location, like when you boot) but then disappear. Keyboard lights on. Repeatedly I tried resetting SMC, P-RAM and one other suggestion found on line—which was to press power button once (brings up shut down/restart window, invisible with the black screen but still functional, then 'S' (blind action, but selects Sleep option), then hold power key down to force shut down, wait 15 seconds, then restart—but all to no avail.\nTHE FIX: Fix was to be holding down Command key then rapidly tapping 'Q' immediately desktop appeared after login. This quit the top application, Preview, which was displaying a pdf downloaded from the CA DMV website, zooming in on which was the last thing I did before the issue first occurred.\nI trashed the pdf file—and machine rebooted normally. Preview then worked normally, and machine shut down/restarted normally as well.\nIssue therefore seemed related to zooming in on a pdf in Preview, or something amiss about the downloaded pdf itself.  \n\nA: I experienced this problem and found this resent article that resolved the issue.\nClick here for the link\nThis is the actual original article\n", "Q: Black screen with cursor instead of login window Last night my mid-2010 Mac Pro woke up and probably installed some update (Mavericks).

I want to purchase a used iPhone 5 and repurpose it and activate it with my existing Apple ID, and use it as if it were an iPod touch, without a service contract from a phone provider. I also do not want to jailbreak this iPhone.\nI'm familiar with questions like this one and with Apple's knowledge base article \"Using an iPhone without a wireless service plan\", but my usage scenario seems to be different.\nTo the best that I can understand, Apple's instructions apply to a person who has an existing iPhone mobile service plan. In this scenario, said person buys a newer, second iPhone for use with his existing SIM card and mobile provider, but wants to keep the old iPhone and use it merely as an iPod touch. The instructions are to take the working SIM card registered to that person's mobile provider account for use with the new iPhone, and use it to activate the old iPhone once, remove the SIM card, and then keep the old iPhone for use as an iPod touch. But this presumes, unless I am mistaken, that both the new iPhone and the old iPhone will be registered to the same Apple ID.\nI, on the other hand, have never had an iPhone service contract with a company like AT&T or Verizon. I honestly have no need for an iPhone. Rather, I have owned a succession of iPod touches over the years, which I use over WiFi every day. I don't want or need a mobile account with a service provider for an iPhone.\nMy old iPod touch 4th generation is no longer doing what I need it to do because today's apps run too slow on it. I don't want to buy an iPod touch 5th generation at this point because it only has an A5 processor, and I don't want to wait to see if Apple ever releases a newer-generation iPod touch.\nSo my question is this: Can I purchase a used iPhone without a mobile service contract, borrow an iPhone SIM card from a friend who has his own Apple ID different from mine, and use my friend's active SIM card one-time to register my used iPhone to my own Apple ID, not to my friend's Apple ID?\nIf this will not work, what method can I use, if any, to end up with a working iPhone-as-iPod-touch that is registered to my own existing Apple ID and nobody else's, considering that I have never had a mobile service plan for an iPhone at all?\n\nA: I solved the problem by making an appointment at the Genius Bar at the local Apple Store, explaining what I was trying to do, and asking for their help. Even though I purchased a used iPhone 5c from a third-party, they brought out a working new Sprint SIM card and activated the iPhone with Apple (for use as an iPod touch only. with no phone service) for me. They also let me keep the SIM card in case I need it to reset the iPhone.\nThe new SIM card that the Sprint Store had given me earlier, for one reason or another, did not work. \nThe Genius in the Apple Store told me that Sprint SIM cards are very specific, and some would work in a 5c and others would not.\nThe Sprint SIM card model that did work with my iPhone 5C was Sprint part number SIMGLW406C.\nThe Sprint SIM card model that did not work with my iPhone 5C was Sprint part number SIMGLW406R.\n\nA: The SIM card, while required for activation, holds no information about the AppleID.\nI am not sure if you can uses a friend's SIM card to do this but you CAN walk into an AT&T store and get a SIM card for your iPhone.\nJust tell them your friend messed up his SIM card and needs another one. You should not need to give them a phone number or anything else, there should be no charge for the SIM card.\nOnce you have a valid, new, SIM card you should be able to activate the phone and use it as an iPod touch without having a cellular service plan.\n", "Q: Have Automator parse down folders and list all filenames without their extension Automator newbee question here.

It seems that the Monitor driver is broken or simply wrong.\n\nAlso, in the system information, the monitor is listed as 1080p TV ?!+\n\nHas anyone the same problem?\nI did not find an update for the monitor profile. Is this a fancy Mavericks bug?\nI've zapped the PRAM but that did not change anything.\nIn Monitor Settings, tried to \"detect monitor\" and listing all resolutions - to no avail. \nThanks for you help\n\nA: The problem is Mac OS X. It is limited (in software, in the drivers) to a certain pixel colour clock rate for the HDMI port. The hardware in the Mac is more than capable of driving your WQHD monitor at 2560 x 1440 etc., but you can't do it via HDMI as the operating system's interface to it is essentially crippled in software.\nIt'll work via the DisplayAdapter port, though. The downside is that the single Thunderbolt connection will be taken, and you won't be able to connect to your monitor and other gear at home.\n\nA: Alright, the puzzle is solved. \nI bought a miniDisplayPort to DisplayPort Adapter cable and hooked it up to my PowerBookPro. Automagically I can select WQHD 2560x1440 in the monitor settings. \nHDMI is said to be limited to 1920x1200 (Even though I had my WQHD monitor hooked up with HDMI under 10.9.1 without any problem.) 10.9.2 seems to be more strict.\n\nA: Looking at your Display profile it shows the ASUS as a Television.\nConsequently, it is set to run at wrong settings.\nYour mac will be using RGB instead of YCbCr mode.\nPossible fix is on the Monitor site.\nChange the input source on the monitor till your Mac shows it as a Monitor.\nUPDATE:\nI turns out the external monitor problems is a wide spread\nissue with the 10.9.2 (in most cases not with 10.9.1), and you can report yours here.\n\nA: I had the same issue on the same screen (but without the iOS update), and the mini displayport to displayport was the solution: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CAGDUA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 \nGood luck. \n", "Q: Automatically categorize downloads?

A while ago, I dual booted with ubuntu linux and followed a tutorial on youtube to do so, but later I wanted all of my hard drive to be for osx, so I deleted the ubuntu partition, but now I am left with the following in diskutility: \n\nThe problem isnt the disk0s4 partition size, but rather the fact that it prevents me from accessing another 70 gb of hard drive space.

Thanks alot!\n\nA: Two things come to mind - booting from recovery HD might let Disk Utility be more free in changing the filesystem where your OS resides. You could also try removing it using diskutil in terminal:\ndiskutil unmount disk0s4\ndiskutil mergePartitions ignored ignored disk0s2 disk0s4\n\nYou will want to have a backup or be familiar with command line and also verify that your Macintosh HD is really disk0s2 by reviewing diskutil list before making any changes.\nOnce the disk0s4 is subsumed by Macintosh HD you may need to expand that to fill the drive:\ndiskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 R\n\nIf done properly on a system with no issues, all the above commands are non-destructive to disk0s2 (presumably Macintosh HD) and the boot volume support. You will need to go in and set your startup disk to the resized volume using System Preferences to avoid a long delay each time you start your Mac as it looks for the old location of disk0s2 from which to boot.

Before I installed Mavericks, my computer ran fine; now it is always using up all 4 GB of RAM that I have, and using up hard drive memory to keep it running, which makes the computer slow to the point where I can't even use it sometimes.\nWhen I look at Activity monitor, my active tasks don't even add up to 2 GB, let alone 4. What on EARTH is the problem and how can I fix it? At this point I just want to do a factory reset on the darn thing.\n\nA: Mavericks' new memory management tool was designed to do exactly that, use AS MUCH RAM as possible. See, \"free ram\" doesn't actually do anything until it's used. It's just there idle, waiting to be allocated. Mavericks uses physical memory much more in order to speed up actions. For example, closed applications and file will be cached until memory is needed, at which point they can be overwritten.\nFor example, my 24GB machine currently has around 14GB of file caches (after around 5 weeks of uptime). In total, 18 GB of my 24 is used. This demonstrates Mavericks attempt to cache everything possible. If not for file caches, I'd only be using 4GB of my 24GB of RAM, basically rendering 20GB (~83%) of my system memory (costing well over $300) as completely unused.\nI don't think your performance issues are a result of the new memory management. If anything, there should be decreased disk access, faster load times, etc. You can try troubleshooting by running sudo purge in terminal to force the deletion of file caches and inactive pages. (Note: Free RAM ≠ faster performance)\n\nA: The easiest way to test a factory reset is to make a brand new user and disable the auto log in to prevent your typical presses from starting at boot.\nYou can then restart the OS and log in to the clean user and grab a baseline of the memory allocation your system software and add-on settings are using. Once you have that, you can start to measure and change and decide if it's due to the programs you are running or if the OS needs to be tuned for your workload. I commented on some data you can edit in the question and we can see if there is an easy fix for you.\n", "Q: How Can I Log Crontab File Writes I'm looking for a way to log crontab file writes.

If your OS X System knowns the file extension, it will change the icon (after renaming) and link it to the App that can handle that extension (and is set as default App to open those file types).\nThe folder then becomes a package or container, where you cannot easily look inside by browsing in finder. But you can right-click on it and choose \"Show Package Contents\" to see what is inside. \n\nSometimes the (folder-) file extension is hidden by System Default (as for iPhoto Library containers).\n\nA: Was able to resolve this issue from information here.\nBasically associate the file extension with another app, ie Calculator, then clear the associated by running this command in Terminal:\n`locate lsregister` -u /System/Applications/Calculator.app\n\nfollowed by:\nxattr -d com.apple.ResourceFork *file_which_won't_open*\n\nThis clears the extended attributes on the file.\nFull details below:\nhttp://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57326949-263/how-to-clear-custom-application-associations-in-os-x/\n\nA: Unfortunately the solution above could not solve the problem, because the macOS would restructure the association soon later(environment is macOS 11.15.7).\nSo I download an unnecessary app from the AppStore and change this extension file default open with it, such as Xnip.app. After running command as below delete this app from LaunchPad quickly.\n`locate lsregister` -u /Applications/Xnip.app\n\nIf you download this app again, it will associate with it again. This is not perfect solution, but worked for me.\n", "Q: How to avoid newly downloaded iOS apps to be automatically downloaded in another device Say I download App A in my iPhone. The app will be automatically appeared in my iPad. How to prevent that from happening? I want to download separately because different devices have different needs.\nThanks\n\nA: In each devices settings, you can disable automatic downloads in Settings -> iTunes & App Store and then disable \"Apps\" in the \"Automatic Downloads\" section. This will stop apps from automatically being downloaded onto your iPad. You will need to install the specific apps you want on the device manually through the App Store.\n", "Q: Hidden Folder not showing in Finder with show all hidden files I have a FreeBSD server where I store my web files.

You would need to dig into exactly which subsystem creates here caches and determine of there is a way to manually flush them or move them to trash and then reboot to see when/how/what size they get recreated. \nI would boot to single user mode and use rm to clear that file since nothing is using it then. You could also use sudo mv /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd/data /tmp and then reboot. After the reboot you can delete the file from /tmp with sudo rm /tmp/data.\nMy hunch is you have Xcode installed and have introduced a large number of symbols into your database from one or more iOS versions so that Xcode can symbolicate crash dumps to assist in debugging apps using Xcode. However, it could also be a bug and whenever that subsystem starts recycling the cache, it will clear itself. If you can limit the number of SDK you use in Xcode, that might help as well. My feeling is the people with 60m files don't use Xcode, those with 1MB developer for one version of iOS at a time and those with larger size databases have multiple OS X and iOS SDK activated from within Xcode.\n\nA: Using things from this link (http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/how_to_recover_missing_hard_drive_space/) I found a file - com.apple.coresymbolicationd  of 133GB. \nTo delete, boot in Safe Mode (Cmd-S before the Apple logo comes up), run a filesystem check, mount the drive and then just sudo rm the file \n\nA: Just to pile on here...\nI ROUTINELY delete the contents of the various Caches folders on my Macs and have since O/S X came out. By routinely, I mean \"when I have a problem that might be caused by a damaged cache file.\"\nI will also use utilities like Onyx to do the same thing from time to time, as it does other maintenance things at the same time.\nThey are temporary files and, just like on Windows, can safely be deleted. I will often reboot after deleting them, just to be safe but regardless the contents of those directories can be safely deleted.\nOne thing to note, if that file keeps getting created and is VERY large like it is now, then you have some troubleshooting to do.\n\nA: I ran Mavericks Cache Cleaner to clean out all my Caches folders - the user ~/Library/Caches folder, the top-level /Library/Caches folder, and the system's /System/Library/Caches folder, including a 2GB coresymbolicationd. Nothing bad seems to have happened as a result (and I reclaimed some disk space).\nIt is probably wisest to do this the way the OP eventually did it, namely, boot with Safe Mode, clean the caches, and reboot.\nI do not feel, however, that we are getting to the bottom of this. 9GB is big. What is causing such a large file to accumulate? I don't think we know that. Deleting the cache deals only with a surface manifestation of something that may have a deep cause.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro case that ventilates and protects against dust I like to use my MacBook remotely and therefore I need to leave it standby.

Even though this disables assisted GPS which uses WiFi to help the GPS lock, it's still a nice battery saver trick which I loved while in the Android world.\nI couldn't find any iPhone app that does the same. Does it exist?If not, is it because apple restricts such app control?\n\nA: There is no public API to control the Wifi on iOS. Therefore Apple won't allow it on the AppStore. \nIf such an app exists then maybe on Cydia. \n\nA: I know this question was asked 6 years back but I thought I should comment. With the latest IOS 14 update and the new Shortcut app. you can create an automation based on location. For example, when I leave X do the following action like turn WiFi Off. I have done this but did not get the opportunity to try it out due to the current restrictions on travel pandemic related and being a person with a disability I don't want to risk my behind.\nMy thoughts are till you are in that WiFi network and leave it; it should disable WiFi but I have also created an automation to turn WiFi On once I come back to that location. My dilemma is WiFi is turned off and I don't use Data much unless critical e.g. booking a Uber ride so when I arrive at my location, Data is switched off. Will my phone know where I am with this disabled; if not I think it will fail in connecting to WiFi when I have reached the location. The second automation of turning WiFi On would not work I guess\n\nA: It does not exist without jailbreak, (and if it does) checking (and saving!) your location each time waste alot of battery resulting in the opposite of what you're trying to achieve.\nBesides, on iOS 7 if you open Control Center (by moving your finger from the bottom of the screen to the middle), you can uncheck WiFi very easily.\n\n\nA: Another, semi-manual solution is to create a reminder for when you leave / arrive at a particular location to enable/disable your Wi-Fi.\n\nA: Siri: \"Turn Wifi OFF\"\nSiri: \"Turn Wifi ON\"\nAs Siri requires a data connection, turning WiFi on will only work if you have a cellular connection.\n\nA: As noted, only a jailbroken phone allows this capability.\nAs a workaround:\nUse IFTTT and use the iOS location channel. Use Launch Center Pro to open the URL prefs:root=WIFI.\nThis will open the WiFi settings preference page.\nAlso have a look at this overview of iOS Settings URLs\n\nA: I use recipes from IFTTT.com and get notifications to remind me what to do, based on my location.\nA lot of restrictions on iOS, compared to android, but a location based notification is better than a reminder.\nIf entered  location, turn off WiFi.\nIf left  location, turn on WiFi.\nI don't need to turn off, other times, so, YMMV here on the recipes.\nYou need to install \"IF\" app from the AppStore.\n\nA: If you switch off “Ask to Join Networks” your WiFi won’t chew up as much battery. That being said, the WiFi on iPhones doesn’t use a significant amount of power anyway. \n", "Q: Recording audio (book) and creating useable chapters to send via email using Garageband. Help! My son has learning disabilities, he is in college, and there was no audiobook available for one of his textbooks.  I have spent hours recording the book for him, creating chapters as I went along.  I imported the file into i-Tunes, and have run into two problems.  \n\n\n*\n\n*The chapters I marked in GarageBand do not show up in iTunes, so I cannot simply go to Chapter 3, for instance - I have to listen/scroll along to find where a specific chapter begins.  Is there a way to fix this, so that he can go directly to a certain chapter?\n\n*The file is too large to send via email, so I need to figure out one of two options:    Can the file be broken into chapters and sent individually? This could resolve the problem above... Or, secondly, is there a way for me to share it using iTunes store (or would that be violating copyright to share it on iTunes?)   Or, can anyone come up with another way to accomplish this?  \nHe is far from home and we will not see him before the end of his year, so we need to be able to do this via email or web... I can send him the file in hard copy - either a thumb drive or disc - but will chapters be visible there?  I suspect not, given that we'd be copying from iTunes, where they are not visible...\nI was planning to send this to him today, so I'm hoping someone will have some ideas that can help me...\n\nA: Yes, you should break it up so that you can solve both problems. \nThe easiest way to do this is to create another track and mute it. \nThen you can use the ⌘ + T \"Split\" function at each chapter (if need)\nFinally drag all the audio but the current chapter you are exporting into the muted track. (Use select all and then shift-click the chapter you want to leave behind to unselect just that one.)\nForgot to mention:\nYou will do one export for each chapter. \nIn my experience when you export this it won't have a lot of silence after the end of the chapter, but if it does there is a UI element (I don't know the name) but it is a purple triangle in the time line that you can drag to the end of the audio you want to export.\nIt will take a bit, but you can do it. \nOne last note: since it is spoken word, you can export it at a pretty low bit rate.

I went through various materials, and I found over the air profile delivery and few other methods like MDM to push the configuration. But it seems only the configuration can be pushed using these features.\nIn Apple Configurator and iPhone Configuration Utility, the devices should be connected to the computer physically. I would like to install the app in all the company-owened devices (around 1000 devices) without asking any permission from the user. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: No, installing apps 'without asking any permission' is definitely impossible. Attempting to install an enterprise app over the air will prompt upon attempted installation and the first attempted launch of the app. This is un-negotiable.\nYou can install apps over the air using enterprise distribution. This allows you to set up a 'portal'-like page which people can download the app from. A plist is downloaded to the device informing it of the location of the app bundle and some information about the app itself. For an example of this, see the Stack Exchange iOS app beta. For more information about enterprise distribution, see the guides available in the Member Centre.\n", "Q: Are there iPad handwriting apps that allow you to insert space between lines? I prefer to take notes and design code by hand. There are several good apps (Penultimate, Readability, Noteshelf, etc.), but they all seem to lack something I really wish they had: the ability to add space in the middle of the document, between lines.\nMost or all of the handwriting apps I've used have a selection tool, but none of them allow you to insert text in the middle of the document.\nAs an example, imagine you've handwritten this list:\n\n\n*\n\n*First\n\n*Second\n\n*Fourth\n\n\nOops: you forgot to write \"Third.\" You tell the app to add space between Second and Fourth (which pushes the rest of the document down). Then you add it such that the list now looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First\n\n*Second\n\n*Third\n\n*Fourth\n\n\nDoes anyone know of an app that affords this?\n\nA: MyScript Notes Mobile has that feature. It's pretty neat. You just press on blank space where you want the lines to split, and a \"shift\" pop-up appears. When you select that, a line appears that lets you move all the writing beneath it up or down as far as you want within the page's limits. \n\nA: You can try Microsoft OneNote for iPad. The text forms almost as nicely as Penultimate with slight pressure sensitivity.\n\nA: I think no App Engineer already encountered such a feature Request for his App.\nMost of the time users just write on pad like on paper so what do you do on this problem on Paper?

Change a single byte in a file, and it backs up again.  Move it into a new directory, technically it's a new file, so new backup.  There is no way to avoid this in the current implementation.  Ideally future enhancements to Time Machine will enable block level backups and some form of de-duplication, which will fix both the above scenarios, but for now you just have to be aware of it.  What you can choose to do, if you like, is confirm that the new location is successfully backed u p in the new place, and then manually remove the old location from your Time Machine.  This clearly doesn't prevent the need from repeating the backup, but it does at least stop you doubling the storage requirements.  Having said that, the old stuff will naturally get recycled off as it's no longer required should the backup drive fill.\n\nA: In short: TimeCapsule will backup everything again. That's the reason why I backup big data manually.\n", "Q: Can I control the ringer volume based on a timer/clock? My wife leads a very scheduled life.

So it is nearly impossible to call her.  \nSimple solution, use clock to turn to silent and back to active.  Nope, doesn't do that.  Must be an app for that!  Nope.  A few apps claim so but actually just set timers to remind you to turn it back on and, since it is in silent mode, they just flash the screen.  Which does little good in a purse.\nHow can we accomplish this either with built-in functionality or with an app?\n\nA: Apple does not allow apps to \"play with\" that system setting. That's the technical reason why there's no app for it.

They might just do the touch mentioned above which some users probably didn't do.\nSadly this all didn't help me, so I decided to give up the camera until Apple fixed this and disabled the VDCAssistant (must be repeated after each boot, when the problem still occurs, and whenever something wanted to access the webcam).

I don't know if it has any other effects, but my CPU load is back to normal.\n\nA: It seems to be potentially caused by third party apps used for display mirroring or streaming. In my case it was caused by AirDisplay and removing that program solved it. Try to boot into safe mode and when the problem disappears in safe mode it is almost certainly caused by third party software.\n\nA: As explained above, disabling VDCAssistant seems to resolve this issue. However, even after disabling this, there are some other errors that can appear e.g. this error logged in the console several times per second:\nWindowServer[432]: _CGXGLDisplayContextForDisplayDevice: No matching context for device (0x7f9c42d034c0) - disabling OpenGL\n\n(mentioned here)\nI haven't found a workaround for this aside from rebooting and/or disabling the DisplayLink adapter (the cause of the issue for me). Hopefully this is pending a patch from Apple.\n\nA: Opening Windows 7 through Parallels seems to be the trigger that sets the crash cascade in motion. Thrashing VDCAssistant seems to have cured it in the short term. Hopefully it does not lead to other issues down the road.\n\nA: Google Chrome\n\nRemoving the Google Chrome web browser solved the problem for me. \nI was running Mountain Lion in a Parallels 11 virtual machine, and had a crash log generated repeatedly as described in the Question, with names such as VDCAssistant_2015-11-22-120350_localhost.crash.

It came with a Target 2 year warranty. From the time I started using it the battery never read correctly. I decided before the warranty was up in February 2013 to send it in for repair. They returned it and said they replaced the battery. It still does not read correctly.\nI have done backup and restores as well as full wipes without restoring the backup. Upgraded OS. Currently it is jailbroken but it performs this way with the jailbreak installed or not.\nI installed a cydia package that displays the actual battery health and it says the design capacity is 930 and currently it is at 859. So I dont think its a bad battery. I have uploaded a video to YouTube to show the issue.\nAnyone have any ideas?\n\nA: I'm a n00b so can't reply to your comment, but can hopefully give some more details in this answer. \nYes, the battery on the 4th gen touch (assuming that's the correct model) is soldered to the board. It would be interesting to know what Target did, as Apple don't do actual repairs on iPods - it would have been replaced like-for-like under their warranty. The fact that you're having the same issue persisting after the battery was replaced, and you've ruled out software by restoring would obviously suggest something else as you mentioned. There's not much in the way of diagnosis avaliable for these but I'd guess that it's likely to be an issue with the power management IC on the board. \nIf you're experienced with BGA work, this could probably be replaced, but it would be easier to replace the board if you can get hold of one, or to be honest just replacing the iPod in this case I think. Depending on the storage size, an out of warranty swap from Apple is maybe around $100 if you're in the US (90 day warranty), or they should give you around 15% off a new one in-store if you give it to them for recycling and buy a new one. Lastly, you could of course punt it on eBay or the like and get a new one.\nHope that's of some help.\n", "Q: Which MacBook with Windows? I'm working off a mid 2009 13\" MBP right now which I want to replace soon. I'm thinking of getting an MBA instead - I would probably get an 11\" for the road, with an external monitor for working at home. \nBut here's my problem: I will go back to school this summer and I'm required to use Excel for Windows for my classes (sadly, Excel for Mac won't do, urgh!). Therefore, I will have to also install Windows 8 (with Boot Camp) on my new computer. Will either of the MBAs hold up? (Obviously, I'd go for the highest RAM and hard disc possible.)\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: Try a Virtual Machine (VM).\n1) You own a Windows license: Try VirtualBox (with ExpansionPack). It's free, but you might need a MB Pro because you have to assign at least one CPU-core to the VM.\n2) You don't have a Windows license: Try Parallels. Then you can run Windows software from the OSX desktop without having windows installed. Maybe the better alternative but it costs 50$. With Parallels a MB Air should do the job.\n\nA: I've done this recently for a boss who wanted a \"Laptop with windows 7 as light and as nice as the MacBook Air.\"\nI squeezed the SSD OSX volume down to minimum as he was only interested in Windows. \nIt works great, just follow the instructions in BootCamp for making the USB key to install Windows. It will put the whole install media on the USB key plus all the BootCamp drivers. So you will need a Mac with an optical drive if your install media is a CD/DVD to create the USB key installer. You'll probably need an 8GB key too that can be reformatted.\nAnd yes get it with lots of RAM and HD space and use Win 7 x64 to take advantage of all that lovely RAM, otherwise you'll only have about 3.5GB RAM available. Which is pretty usable under Windows but as we all know, \"if a lot is good, too much is perfect!\" \n", "Q: How can I upload my camera roll to my Photo Stream retroactively? I have a iPhone 4 and set up iCloud on my device, including the Photo Stream service. Everything seems to be set up fine and I have the option to select Photo Stream in Photos.app.\nHowever, the message I get when tapping Photo Stream is that all new photos will be transferred into the Photo Stream.\nHow do I get the current photos in my phone to show up in my Photo Stream?\n\nA: Given that this question is a few months old, you may have already found an answer, but I figured I'd provide one in case anyone else comes to this post looking for an answer to the same question.\nWhile I don't know of a way to add photos from the Camera Roll to the \"main\" photo stream retroactively, you can add pictures to shared photo streams.  Those will sync up with iCloud and any iCloud-connected devices, just like the \"main\" photo stream.\nTo add pictures to a shared photo stream:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a shared photo stream. On your iPhone, open the Photos app, go to the Shared tab (bottom center of the screen), and tap on \"New Shared Stream\". Give the new stream a name.\n\n*Go to your Camera Roll, tap on Select (top right of the screen), and select (tap) each picture that you want to add to the new shared stream.\n\n*Once all of the pictures you want to add to the stream are selected, tap the share button (bottom left of the screen), choose iCloud on the menu that pops up, and choose the newly created shared photo stream.\n\n\nA: Photos on your phone from before iCloud was activated can't be easily moved to the main photo stream. (Apple desires that you activate iCloud when you get the iPhone. They assume that's what everyone will do.)\nThere are solutions however.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use a shared photo stream.\n\n*You can sync your phone to a Mac\nand use iPhoto to sync them through photo streams.\n\n\nA: well, the easiest way is to simply e-mail the photos to yourself.  once in your inbox simply save them to your camera roll and thus your photo stream.  yes you'll have duplicates in your camera roll but that is easily remedied by deleting the \"original\" version of the photo.\n\nA: An even easier way is to just screen shot the picture then refresh your camera roll app.\n\nA: This is quite old question, but I have just found it and I would like to share my fresh experience. I use Mac with OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 and iPhone 6 with iOS 10.3.1.\nIn your Photos app on iPhone\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Album / Camera Roll, Select photo, then share to Cloud Photo Sharing. Use existing or temporary Shared Album as destination.\n\n\nIn Photos app on Mac\n\n\n*Go to Shared / Shared Album\n\n*Right click on the photo and then select Import\n\n*Photo will appear in Albums / All photos immediately, in Albums / My Photo Stream in a while and also on all your iCloud enabled devices.\n\n\nI hope it helps somebody.\nPS.

I configured the Dvorak keyboard and its almost working. I need to write chars like 'á' typing two keys, but when I type the first the ' char already shows. How to fix this?\n\nA: Diacriticals for vowels and some consonants are created using the \"dead key\" system.\nFirst you type the \"dead key\" by holding down two keys at the same time; for example, Option-E, which produces \"´\". Then immediately after that you let go of the two keys and then type the vowel that you want the accent to appear above. So in this example, to get \"é\", you type Option-E, let go, then type \"e\".\nIf you want \"á\", then you first type Option-E, then let go and type \"a\".\nIf you want \"í\", you first type Option-E, then let go and type \"i\".\nHere are the dead keys in the Dvorak layout, highlighted in orange.\n\n\n\nA: If you are using OS 10.7 and higher, try just holding down the key for the base letter.  You should get a popup menu of accented versions (the Character Picker) from which you can choose the one you want.\n", "Q: Safari remember password of all sites after upgrading to 7.0.2 I upgraded to Mavericks 9.0.2 the day it was released.

When copying files between the Mac Minis to the MBA, it's extremely slow. For the same 2G data, it's about 1 hour over WIFI.\nWhat's more strange: I restarted the MBA a couple of times just to see if things can improve. The first time when it restarted, the copying process estimated to 2 hours, and the second time 3 hours!\nI tried many suggestions on this forum dealing with Mavericks' slow Finder and file transfering, none of which helped.\nI think one logical conclusion I can reach is that there is something different between the MBA and the Minis.

Had a similar issue with INSIGNIA Slim Profile 7-Port USB-C HUB, read the paper inside the adapter box and found that it supports 30Hz max only.\n\nA: I came here searching for the answer myself because I've done it before but I installed an update and lost the settings.  csreen and switchresx can both set the resolution for you, but there's a limit in OSX that needs to be bypassed in order to accomplish this.  Additionally with the latest versions of OSX there's some sort of \"system file protection\" that prevents you from patching the relevant file.  First, you have to disable that file protection (which I think gets turned on after each update) and then you have to patch the relevant file in OSX.  If I find the answer for the latest version then I'll come back here and update the answer but you should google something to the effect to osx (your version) pixel clock unlock patch.  Once you patched the relevant files you should be able to use utilities like switchresx (which is what I use) to set custom resolutions.  I've found a patch for one version of osx here: https://github.com/Floris497/mac-pixel-clock-patch\ngood luck!\n\nA: cscreen\nYou can use the freely available Terminal app cscreen to force display settings.

I am looking for a second opinion on an issue with my brand new iMac.\nI purchased a new iMac direct from Apple about 3-4 weeks ago, and initially everything was fine. However, in the last few weeks I've been getting an increasing number of crashes (particularly with Safari, but others too), as well as a few kernel panics (usually from Parallels). As it happens most with these two, I've been troubleshooting them trying to find solutions.\nAfter a particularly annoying crash yesterday, I decided to run the Apple Diagnostics tool (hold D on boot), which told me there was an error with the memory (codes PPM002, PPM003 and PPM004). I duly contacted Apple who've gone through the basic steps like removing startup items, resetting Safari, etc and was told to let them know if the problems persist. Fair enough, but they seem to have ignored the Apple Diagnostics result, which is confusing me.\nMy question is this; could the Apple Diagnostics tool be wrong? Is it possible, or even usual, for it to report errors where there are none? I'm concerned that Apple support will lead me on a week long search for software issues (and perhaps even temporarily solve it) when the diagnostics clearly say it is a hardware fault.\nThanks\n\nA: According to this Apple KB you have to contact them.\nThey should be willing to help because you have Apple Care the first 90 days for free and they state it on the site theirselves:\n\n", "Q: Where is the \"Double click on titlebar to minimize\" setting located in Mavericks?

This has been frustrating me for a long time now. I need to be able to save email attachments (NOT export my attachments to third party apps)\nThere are so many email apps in the appstore but why is it so difficult for someone to make an app that allows you to save an attachment to the app's filesystem ? Everywhere its Dropbox this, Google Drive that.\nEXACTLY like how it works on blackberry like this : http://docs.blackberry.com/ko-kr/smartphone_users/deliverables/11298/Attach_a_file_to_an_email_message_664783_11.jsp\nIf not an app, Isn't there atleast a jailbreak tweak to do this ?\n\nA: Dropbox's email management service app, Mailbox, allows you to open attachments in Dropbox or iFile, which in turn saves the attachment to your /var/mobile/Documents folder, but then again, this same thing happens in the stock Mail app (minus the Dropbox integration). What happens is iFile just registers itself as being able to open any file type, so that any application can open its files in iFile. This is how almost every application does it - they simply let iFile do all of the filesystem handling, so they don't have to (it's tricky on iOS; just ask the guy who made Sandcastle).\nIf that doesn't fit your needs, however, there is a paid jailbreak tweak called Attachments+ for Mail that should do everything you're looking for, and it integrates directly with the stock Mail app (plus, it even looks like it uses Sandcastle), and it's recently been updated for iOS 7.\n", "Q: iPhone app install- automation I am trying to automate the installing procedure of iPhone apps (i.e) installing apps for around 5000 phones. For this I am planning to deploy an MDM server in Windows Server 2008 containing Active Directory. Once the successful registration of handsets is established the complete control of iPhone can be taken by the admin. I have following doubts:\n1) My main objective is to push the apps that are available in the app store, hence Apple Push Notification Certificate will be sufficient to set up my MDM server and install apps?\n2) Once the user registers his iOS device will I be able to install/uninstall applications into the device?\n3) Can I implement payload mechanisms like AppLock Payload by just having Apple Push Notification Certificate?\n\nA: What you want to do sounds possible with the steps you describe, except for 3). You haven't said which MDM server you plan on using but I'll assume it's one that implements the concept of Managed Apps.\nOnce your device(s) are enrolled with the MDM server, it can automatically push down whatever apps you wish to the device (either in-house/corporate or App Store). Those apps are considered Managed and you will have some control over them, including the ability to remove them remotely.\nIn specific answer to your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, once you have set up an MDM server and configured the APNS certificate (from https://identity.apple.com/pushcert/) you can enrol and manage devices through it.\n\n*Yes, once the device is enrolled you can push apps to it. The mechanism for this differs a little depending on which MDM server you use. Most will allow for auto-push during enrolment or a push notification prompt asking the user to install from the MDM server's App Store.\n\n*In order to use AppLock, the device must be Supervised. To enable Supervised mode on an iOS device, it must either be configured physically via a Mac + Apple Configurator or be a device purchased through DEP (Device Enrolment Program). Devices can be Supervised through an MDM server (so over-the-air) but they must be purchased as a DEP device through an authorised reseller in a supported country. Devices that are purchased outside the DEP program cannot currently be converted to DEP / Supervised at a later date.\n\n", "Q: OSX 10.9.2 for the second time I got OSX 10.9.2 update installed on February 26th.

Every thing else being equal I would expect the SDD disk to last longer. That's because the SSD controller tends to spread writes among the available memory cells, and the more cells available the less writes each cell will receive.\nAnd of course I would expect a new drive to fail later than an old and used drive.\nThen I would say that generaly speaking a newer and bigger SSD will last longer than an older and smaller one.\n", "Q: Soft switch for Mac sound output When I'm alone, I unplug my headset and let the sound output from the load speaker of my iMac, and when there are other people around, I plug in the headset in order to not bother people around me.

Has anyone faced such problem? What have I done wrong?\n\nA: Can confirm it's the order of HDD-SSD!\nI have the same issue on my MBP 13\" 9.2\nUsually, the instructions assume that you disk0 is the HDD and disk1 the SSD. This should be the case 99% of times, but not in mine (just like with yours).\nThe DVD-Replacement Hard Disk Caddy I bought only supported SATA2 not SATA3, which caused random errors with the SSD. So the solution was to put the HDD in the Caddy in the SSD in the Hard Drive slot. Problem solved, I thought.\nBut of course, I completely forgot about it when setting up the Fusion Drive. And now, I have the very same symptoms: it is a CoreStorage LVG, but not a Fusion Drive.\nMy diskutil cs list looks the same as yours. Usually there should be a mention of Fusion Drive, but not for me.\n\nA: It seems that the order of the disks is important, when you are adding a SSD after a HDD, the Fusion Drive is not functioning as it should be.\nLook at this question:\nIs there a way to change order of physical disks in Corestorage\n", "Q: Want to view images in sequence and delete I have downloaded photos to an iMac from camera into folders, not iPhoto.

This way you can do your updating on off hours. \nI hope this info is helpful. \n\nA: also you can use ARD on your server and on your desktop/laptop, set the server as the task manager and it will keep a que of all your pushes. \nTalk a look at a PackageMaker.app, You can download it from https://developer.apple.com/downloads look for \"Auxiliary tools for Xcode\"\nand you can wrap all your apps into one package to push out, this works for almost everything. \n\nA: From an addition the OP made directly to the question:\n\nFor those interested we've started using Bittorrent Sync to distribute the non-Mac Store Apps. Means that they can get bits of the apps and it doesn't break the connection when they go offline.\n\n", "Q: How to install Homebrew on Mavericks?

The problem is, when doing it this way, Safari always remembers what it was last and overrides the change you made in the plist. Anyone know how to hack this? I plan on modifying this file through a python script if anyone was curious.\n\nA: Well that was quick, I found the answer.

I've opened the back and it appears the bottom of the battery, the speaker and charger point have been damaged. All at the bottom of the phone. The logic board appears fine.\nIs it possible to put this into another iPhone 4S and thereafter access all my files, music, photos etc.? Stupidly it hasn't been backed up and there are many things I don't want to lose.\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciated. Also if it is just a straight swap over, do I need to get a replacement with equivalent memory?\n\nA: I purchased another iPhone 4S, removed the logic board and replaced it with the one from my damaged phone. The damaged phone was 32gb and the replacement model was only 16gb. I figured this wouldn't matter as the memory is attached to the logic board itself so as this was being removed I bought the cheapest replacement available. The repair is fairly straight forward and is much easier than replacing the glass screen which I've had to do on a number of occasions for friends. There are many links on YouTube which are perfect to follow. I have subsequently purchased iCloud data to avoid the worry of something like this happening again. I think I was fortunate to have not damaged the logic board otherwise this repair/replacement wouldn't have been possible.  \n", "Q: Possible to add a password to the guest account on Mavericks? I have a very precocious four-year-old who absolutely adores computers. We gave him his own login with which we control his access carefully.\nThe problem is the guest account. It requires no password, so regardless of the parental controls on his account, he can always log on as guest.\nApplying parental controls to the guest account defeats the purpose, as I want my houseguests to be able to use it anytime they like. I would just give them the password on their arrival.\nI suppose I could disable the guest account, and create a separate account which would basically be a normal user account except named \"Visitor\" and with a password. But I like the automatic cleanup of the guest account, and, well, that's kind of what it's there for.\nBut I'm still holding out hope: is there any way to add a password to the guest account?\n\nA: You actually can set a password for the guest account.\nUse sudo passwd guest from the terminal.\n\nA: Sorry, by design the Guest users are Guests (temporary visitors). They do not require password and you can not set one.\nYour only other alternative is to set up a user account with password.\nHowever, that could bring trouble and I would not trust the 4 years one, he/she could find how to change password and then you are locked out :)\n", "Q: Switch Between Windows of the Same Application Again I'm new to Mac.\nI searched and found Command + ` does what I want.

I am running Mail 7.2 and OS X 10.9.2. and it is absolutely incompatible with GMail. I have now installed PostBox 3 and it is a dream as an email client.  So how to I get rid of Apple Mail and its databases from my Mac?\n\nA: I am pretty sure that OS X will not let you delete Mail.app from within the Finder (although you may be able to force it from Terminal). I would not recommend deleting the app from the /Applications folder, since it is considered a part of the OS.\nHowever, there is no reason why it has to live on the Dock, and for the most part if it's not somewhere where you keep seeing it, that's the most important thing it (unless you are really pressed for space on a small SSD, for example).\nYou can delete the mail files (your mail database, all the settings) by going into the ~/Library folder and finding those. Please note that deleting all your mail data will of course delete all your mail data (which is a bit like the \"warning: contains nuts\" sticker on a packet of nuts, but it's worth mentioning!).\nThe mail files all live under ~/Library/Mail/V2, and it's possible that mail attachments are stored separately in ~/Library/Mail Downloads.\n\nA: You can disable the Mail.app as Default mail client and stop using it. \nIn Firefox browser for example, go to the preferences and applications. The select which mail client is to be used.\n\nIf you have made any email accounts remove them and it will stop bothering you. As others have explained removing it by force is possible but there are possible problems with that since it is a part of the OS X.\n", "Q: I backed up my ipad and then did a restore but now some of my apps are coming up incompitable? I backed up my ipad 1 using itunes erased all content off the said ipad.\nThen did a restore using the image that came off the ipadn1 and now there are 22 conflicts where these apps are now incompatible with the ipad.\nI dont understand why as they were running on the ipad before the restore.\nPlease help!\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The best way to do this is to connect the iPad to iTunes and do a 'sync' of everything, including its applications. This saves the iPad's applications to your local computer.\nAfter doing the sync, you should then do a backup. This will save its settings.\nThe reason why it is important to do the sync is because there is the possibility that some applications that you had on the iPad are not available on the App Store any more. Imagine, for example, that you had Flappy Bird installed on there :)\nAfter doing the restore, you should then sync the iPad with iTunes again - this will put all the content that was on the iPad before you restored it, back on the iPad.\nIf you do not do this, the iPad will only be able to get any applications that are still available on the App Store now, and any apps that are no longer available, will not be on the iPad any more.\nEDIT: Apps coming back as being \"not compatible\", may be apps that used to be compatible when they were created ages ago, but have not been compatible with the original iPad for a few years now, and there is no longer a compatible version on the Store.\n", "Q: Hostname changed after setting up virtual host in MAMP I have MAMP Pro installed and recently configured a local virtual host called: test.local.\nNow my OSX terminal prompt says\ntest:~ username$\nI just noticed also when an email bounced back the raw header also shows test.local:\nReceived: from cpe-111-111-111-111.lns1.lon.somehost.com ([222.222.222.2222]:22222 helo=testhost.local)\nI've tried running...\nscutil --set LocalHostName properHostName\n…but it hasn't had an effect.

I've never met anyone who loves Apple's podcasts app.  But I could make peace with it if not for one infuriating design choice that I can't figure out how to correct.\nI have set up iTunes to sync all unplayed podcast episodes to my iPhone.  The Podcasts app is set to not download anything itself and keep only unplayed episodes.

If I put the drive in the laptop do I end up with a 'hackintosh', or will something crazy happen? \n\nA: It won't boot, building a hackintosch machine takes more effort than just swapping a hdd.\nMacs have a different bios than windows pc's and this is not stored on your hdd but in the machine itself.\nOsx needs this special bios to run and \"talk to\" the components of your mac.\nAlso, osx might not have the drivers available for the components in your pc.\nyou could google for info to make a hackintosch\n\nA: There is a thriving Hackintosh community and some sites have lists of hardware they have found compatible. You could see if your laptop might be a candidate...\nBut really installing Mac O/S on a hackintosh can be quite fiddly and encourages hair tearing ;-) However if you like to fiddle around it might be a good project but the HD with Mac OS already on it, nope.

Doesn’t sound good. I assume that since it’s a headphone port it’s pre-amplified whereas Line In expects a plain un-amplified Line Out signal, ergo distortion. Yes?\nIf so, does one of the amp’s other inputs expect a signal pre-amplified as per the headphone port’s output, so that clear sound will come out the other end?\nOr is there no place on the amp where the signal from the headphone port is suitable, meaning I’ll need extra USB hardware? If so, what keywords am I looking for? Is a DAC what I’m after? Those seem to usually come with a headphone amp built in, though? (That is useless to me.) Or should I be looking for something else – e.g. is a “USB soundcard” the thing I’m after?

This is the first time I've been really frustrated owning a Mac, my last one was trouble free for years. This is a MBA purchased about August last year.\nAny clues on what this is, how it could be sorted? Google yields very, very few results.\n\nA: I solved my own problem - but figured I'd answer for anyone else searching for the same thing. \nI run CodeKit to help minimise CSS and JavaScript when building websites. The program works beautifully, but I had it monitoring all the sites (25 or so) I'd built over the past year or so for changes when it was open. I figure this was causing it to open (or at least monitor) thousands of files, resulting in the file table issue.\nBy only selecting the site I'm working on to monitor, everything is working perfectly (again) and as a plus - the CodeKit CPU usage has dropped dramatically.\n\nA: I'm on Mavericks not Mountain Lion but I've also had this problem repeatedly over the past couple of months and in my case I've tracked it down to iTunes. After a few days of running it will gradually accrue thousands of open files - enough to reach the file table's limit.\nI have a short script that monitors the file table use and if I catch it before it's managed to reach the limit, a reboot can be avoided.

It occurred to me I might back up the system I currently run using Time Machine to preserve data, perform a clean install, using my Snow Leopard disks, then upgrade via the App store back to Mavericks, (because Garageband 10.1 cannot run on Snow Leopard), which would effectively give me clean Mavericks installation. I would then reinstall my data from my Time Machine Back up.\nIs this a sensible approach which might work? I'd appreciate any advice. Many thanks, George Bolam.    \n\nA: First thing is to backup your system but you don't need to reinstall your computer via DVD. Instead there is a terminal script which will take the version of the Mavericks installer you got from the Mac App Store and install it on a USB stick. Pretty sweet stuff: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5856\nYou need a USB stick roughly 8 GB or larger and it should be erase before hand. There is another version of the command line that is as follows\n\nsudo \"/Applications/Install OS X Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\" --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath \"/Applications/Install OS X Mavericks.app\"\n\nWith this the USB drive needs to be called Untitled and this will do all the necessary steps in the background. Be aware it will take 30-40 minutes for this to copy over but when it is done you'll see a $ sign.\nNow with that created please restart your mac, hold down alt and choose your USB device. Once you have the install option erase your hard drive through Disk Utility and then you can proceed with a fresh install of Mavericks.\nI would recommend re-downloading Garageband from the Mac App Store fresh instead of transferring it from TimeMachine... hope this helps you out and if you have further questions just comment.\n", "Q: OS X Not Booting into Internet Recovery I own a iMac 2007 (Mid).\nI've realised that whenever i try to boot onto internet recovery, it doesn't.

It will make it feel faster than it was out of the box and that is because it is. A RAM upgrade isn't really necessary and I would suggest investing that money over into a new battery. If the unit hasn't been used in a good long while chances are your battery will be dead or inches away from death.\nA new battery (directly from Apple) will be guarantied for a year and will give you a notebook to take with you (using an SSD instead of a HDD also gives you a few extra minutes in battery life.\nCleanMyMac is not recommended! Instead install a new OS on the SSD and then using an external enclosure transfer the data via Migration Assistant. But always make sure you have a backup of your files. \nHonestly I am more of a fan of keeping things fresh and installing 3PP programs fresh too and manually dragging over your documents, pictures, music, etc.\n\nA: CleanMyMac and other programs like it are often a bit too aggressive in what they \"clean\" and how they do it. A utility like Onyx will clean the HD of unnecessary items and do some maintenance without going to the extremes that CleanMyMac does.\nI agree with Andrew, the SSD is the first consideration followed (VERY) closely by RAM. Those two things will give you the best speedup.\nInstall the O/S fresh on the SSD and use the Migration Assistant to install just user files. Install your apps fresh from install media (downloads, CDs, etc). That should give you the best bang for you buck as there are likely things that apps installed clogging things up.\n\nA: I googled around a bit to see what your mac can handle and this is what I found:\nMaximum memory supported: 6 GB total. Use matched pairs of 4 GB per memory slot. Apple officially supports only 4 GB of RAM in these models.\nHard drive type: SATA I 2.5-inch hard drive; SATA II drives are compatible.\nHard drive size supported: Up to 1 TB\nSo it will work with 6 gigs of ram but apple supports only 4 and for the hdd you need to find a sata II ssd but I am afraid these don't exist. You could of course go for a 7200rpm drive wich is the next best thing, as long as you don't exceed the 1tb mark.\nupdate: and for the cleaning software, I wouldn't buy it..

Deselecting this option allowed the name column to appear.\n\nA: I got it to alphabetize by holding down Option.\n\nA: If you're having issues with changing the sort order, first sort by \"none\" and then resort. Holding the option key produces different order options.\nI solved my column view problem of folders being put at the bottom of the list as opposed to the top of my list using this.\n", "Q: Using iFile to change lock screen passcode I would like to know where to go in iFile to be able to see your ipod passcode and be able to change the 4 digit code through iFile.

The fan runs either for about 5 hours or as long as it takes the MacBooks battery to get empty.\nInfo:\n- I'm running 10.9.2\n- I have this problem for about 2 years\n- I ran an Apple Hardware Test\n- I resetted the SMC and the PRam\n- I reinstalled the MacBook with the original reinstall DVD (OS X 10.5.2) and updated version-by-version (10.6 -> 10.7 -> 10.8 -> 10.9)\n- I replaced the battery\nAnd it's getting worse with the time (until now, it stopped after about 5-10 minutes, but since last December, it doesn't stop anymore)\nNote: Some people might say this is a duplicate of this question, but it's different, as in my case, the fans won't stop.\n\nA: It would make sense from my point of view to look for a certified Apple Service Provider or Apple Retail Store and ask them about replacing your Mac thermal grease. Chances are they offer this in a sort of \"spring cleaning\" program. Over time the thermal paste between your CPU and GPU and the heat sink dries up and doesn't do what it is suppose to do. This can happen but doesn't mean it is, sometimes the fans just get full of dust and need to be cleaned out. The important thing is just making sure the mac is getting good airflow and that its vents are several inches (6-8) away from anything that could be obstructing airflow.\n", "Q: Automator workflow runs forever I have run into a problem with automator: I have a workflow that does image processing (it converts color images to gray). I am able to invoke the workflow from the terminal and it works fine. The command is:\n   automator -i infile.jpg imageconversion.workflow\nHowever, I am facing a problem when I try to integrate this workflow in a webapp, build in Django and deployed with mod_wsgi on Apache.

This one is very odd. My 2010 Macbook Air running latest Mavericks was working very well just yesterday and today it started to play a \"siren sound\" (sounds a bit like warning/alarm/police siren), the sound is very long (2-4 secs.) and it starts every 1-5 minutes. Of course when it happens it unmutes all system sounds :S It's worth noting I don't have any other software that I had yesterday, it just happened like that, overnight.\nWhat I've done to prevent it and find what's causing it:\nMy system sounds are off (Preferences/Sound > \"Play user interface sound effects\" unchecked).\nAll the sound notifications are off.

I regularly commute by bicycle from home to work and find the weight of a MacBook Pro a little excessive. My thought is to have identical MacBooks at the office and home and only carry a hard disk on the bike. \nSo how would it be easiest to ensure that the two laptops are totally synchronised? Would Time Machine do the job or would it be time consuming and cumbersome? Or is there a better way of doing this avoiding cloud-based or network-based sync solutions. \nThe only connection between the two MacBooks will be through a portable hard drive.\n\nA: To keep all settings and files of two Mac's in sync through an off-line method you could place your Home folder on an external HDD.\nThere are plenty of tutorials on-line on how to do this, I will use this one to explain the process. \nI assume you have a user account Allan on the current MacBook Pro (MBP-1) which you would like to share with the new laptop (MBP-2) through an external HDD named ExtDisk. Keep in mind that you should substitute the actual hard disk and user account names.\n\n\n*\n\n*First create a back-up of the user account in case something goes wrong. Time Machine is an option for that, but you can also clone the drive with for example Carbon Copy Cloner.\n\n*Create a new administrator account on each MacBook Pro. This is for the case that you lose the external HDD for some reason or just don't have it with you. This way you'll still have an account from which you can use the laptop.\n\n*Migrate the Allan user account from MBP-1 to the new MBP-2. Here's an Apple Knowledge Base article on how to do that.\n\n*On MBP-1 login to the newly created admin account. Copy the Allan home folder of MBP-1 to ExtDisk. You can do this by using the following Terminal command (the Terminal application is found in Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal.app):\nsudo ditto -v /Users/Allan/ /Volumes/ExtDisk/Users/Allan\nThis command will ask your admin account password to get permission to copy all your files to the external disk ExtDisk.\n\n*When you're done copying, open ExtDisk in the Finder and check if the user folder is there and has (roughly) the same size as the Allan user folder on MBP-1.\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Users & Groups. Right click on the Allan account and click Advanced Options....\n\n*The Home directory line says now /Users/Allan. Click Choose... and navigate to the home folder on ExtDisk.\n\n*Connect the external HDD to MBP-2 and repeat steps 6 and 7 on MBP-2.\n\n*Do the following on each Mac with the external HDD connected: login on the Allan account and check if everything went right. To verify that it actually uses the home folder on the external HDD, select a file on the Desktop, hit cmd+I to show the Get Info window and check if the Where field says /Volumes/ExtDisk/Users/Allan/Desktop.\n\n*If all went well you can delete the /Users/Allan folder on the internal hard drives of MBP-1 and MBP-2.\n\n*Now you can use the setup as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*plugin the external HDD and turn on the laptop\n\n*login on the Allan account at home\n\n*shutdown the laptop at home  (maybe a logout is sufficient).\n\n*disconnect the external HDD. Go to work.\n\n*plugin the external HDD in at work and turn on the laptop.\n\n*use the Allan account at work.\n\n\n\nPro-tip: as you will be carrying around your HDD with you the chance that the drive has an unpleasant physical encounter is somewhat higher. Make sure to have a daily backup running, either at home or at work, or if you really want to be sure at both places.\nDisclaimer: I have not carried out this process myself. I don't accept any responsibility in the case you lose files.\n", "Q: What does repeating beeps mean during charging? During a software update to 7.0.6 this iPhone 4S abruptly turned off and would not turn back on (screen blank).\nWhen plugged into the charger or computer it beeps on a regular basis with the default system ding sound.\niTunes recognizes it, allows photos to be backed up, but requires that I unlock the phone to refresh it or back it up, which I can't do because the display is off. Find my iPhone shows it in its correct location - which just verifies the wifi chipset, I suppose.\nPerforming the reset and restart procedures on Apple's website doesn't do anything.\nThe display is black the entire time.\nWhile I'm pursuing other things, I'd like to find out why the phone is beeping while charging or plugged into the computer.  Does the beeping indicate something relevant to the issue I'm facing?\n\nA: No, its not notifications beeping. \nI have a dropped iPhone 4S here, that has a cracked screen. \nPlugging it into a charger results in a constant beeping every 6 seconds exactly with no display. I have no idea if it's because the display/touchscreen is damaged or if the phone has crashed and is displaying a blank screen as i have no idea of the extent of the damage. \nI'd say it's related to a serious hardware failure that the beeping occurs. \nIt's not a notification issue as the phone doesn't have time to boot up iOS before the beeping starts. Beeps way too soon and notifications wouldn't roll in regular as 6 seconds exactly for over an hour. \n", "Q: DNS change on Airport Extreme I've recently changed the DNS settings on my latest generation Airport Extreme from their default values to Google DNS.

I'm unable to locate a version of BSD that runs on any MacBook Pro.\nI'd like a native install, replacing OS X entirely and not doing a Boot Camp setup or virtualizing over another OS.\n\nA: The one major BSD flavor that stands out and supports the maximum number of MacBook Pro is OS X. \nNo BSD variant I am aware of runs on any MacBook Pro with perfect hardware support (or even good support across the entire line). I'm guessing any specific BSD build won't run on all MacBook Pro since that line spans an Intel Core Duo (Yonah 65nm) chipset and logic board manufactured in late 2005, but there's no harm in trying any BSD you care to try on whatever hardware you have to experiment with.\nNone of the BSD variants have even a fraction of the engineering work and budget that Apple expends on it's BSD variant, so you will be sacrificing that polish, support and driver coverage if you choose to ditch OS X on Mac hardware - especially so on the newest hardware.\n\nA: Of course it's possible: Your Mac is just a generic Intel machine (albeit one running EFI instead of a traditional BIOS unless you set up BootCamp). Grab your favorite BSD install CD, stick it in the drive, and have fun.1\n1 - Because Apple is deprecating the optical disk you may have to make a USB install stick, or plug in an external CD/DVD drive.\nMost of the hardware should work \"out of the box\", but you'll probably need to do some tuning. The FreeBSD folks have a somewhat outdated Wiki page with information on getting FeeBSD running on a MacBook, either under BootCamp or as the only OS on the machine.\n\nI do have to object to calling OS X \"Nothing more than a watered-down version of BSD\" though. First off, it's Mach under the hood (the kernel) - they just borrowed the userland utilities from FreeBSD, and they've diverged pretty far since OS X 10.0.0 ; Second it's goal isn't to be a Unix development platform - it's a workstation.  \nPersonally I find doing (unix) development on a Mac painful, and I wouldn't recommend it for serious, down in the muck unix programming, but as a workstation it's quite adequate (and you're not going to get a GUI like that from any of the open-source *nix systems without spending a pretty substantial amount of time working on it).\nThe amount of work required to get a useful desktop/workstation with any of the open-source *nix systems is substantial compared to running OS X. If you need a BSD (or Linux, Windows, etc.) environment any of the desktop virtualization programs can be used to run it on your Mac, while retaining OS X as the primary operating system.\nYou should also bear in mind that despite what some of us consider questionable design choices (I want to bludgeon the people who came up with the lousy disk I/O scheduling in OS X) Apple builds OS X to run on their hardware. It's about as optimized as you can get, and much like the Star Trek franchise, Even-Numbered OS X releases (10.2, 10.4, 10.6, 10.8) are pretty good.\n\nSo bottom line?\nYes, you can do it. No, I wouldn't personally recommend it.\nThere aren't enough benefits, and you lose a lot of functionality (or have to spend your time making things work, rather than being productive).\n\nA: FreeBSD (if that's the variant you want to run) looks like it should run on the Mac, evidenced here: AppleMacBookWikiEntry\nNetBSD is really the BSD variant that is known for running on just about anything with a processor. They also appear to maybe sorta support Mac hardware. See: NetBSD information\n\nA: Yes it is a simple process for me. I jun ubuntu studio  and am looking to run bsd  on it.

I left mac on but never use it.\n", "Q: Reinstall OS X Snow Leopard on a 2011 MacBook Pro I have a 2011 MacBook Pro. I decided to erase all contents and reinstall the OS. I used the original installation DVD, but I could not install the OS: after the boot I could only enter Disk Utility. I verified the hard disk and it was OK. I did a hardware test and all tests pass with no error.\nWhen I do an installation of OSX on the hard disk, the Mac hangs for hours. I hear the DVD drive spin up, and after some time it spins down again. After that the computer displays the grey apple screen only.\nBecause the original installation disk looked scratched I assumed that the DVD may be damaged. I ordered a new installation disk from Apple (Mac OS X Snow Leopard - with a green sticker New version 10.6.3). When I start up from this DVD it only displays the grey Apple screen, I can't even select an installation language or use the Disk Utility; It's as if the DVD is not bootable.\nWhat could be wrong?\nWhat could be my next step?\n\nA: According to this KB document:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159\nMacBook Pro (Early 2011) requires at least OS X 10.6.6, so the disc you ordered (10.6.3) does not work on your unit as it does not contain the required drivers.\nSolutions:\n1. You can bring your MBP to a nearby Genius Bar for reinstall, or;\n2. Find a older Mac that is supported by your install disc, put your MBP into target disk mode. Run installer on that older computer and install to your target-disk-mode MBP .

Tried everything from other threads nothing and almost all version of versions of windows isos, nothing worked.\nBut using the official Windows 10 image is the only thing that worked for me thus far.\n\nA: I faced the same problem on my new 2018 15 inch MacBook Pro. None of the steps above helped me. However, while doing First Aid on Macintosh HD using Disk Utility, I noticed that I was getting the following error:\n\"Warning: crypto: val object (oil:0x04): invalid state\".\nThis was not going away, no matter how many times I did First Aid. While searching for a solution, I read (here: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/89882) that one way to fix this issue is to reinstall MacOS. Below are the steps that worked for me, in the exact order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot machine and go to \"Internet Recovery Mode\" (Press option + cmd + R while startup)\n\n*Connect to internet, select Disk Utility and select Macintosh HD.\n\n*Erase the drive using default options. (Warning: You will loose all data in your machine)\n\n*Close the utility and go back to the starting screen and select \"Reinstall MacOS\"\n\n*After installation (this will take some time) and minimal setup, download 64-bit Windows 10 iso from Microsoft website (https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO)\n\n*Reboot the machine, do a PRAM reset (Press option + cmd + P + R while startup)\n\n*After booting up, open Disk Utility and do a First Aid. Confirm the error is no longer there.\n\n*Open BootCamp Assistant and follow the normal procedure.\n\n\nThe rest of the Windows 10 installation was smooth for me. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Finally got this working, thanks to a person named \"turbostar\" over on discussions.apple.com:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-run Boot Camp Assistant to remove the Windows partition and restore the full Mac HD as a single partition.\n\n*Run a PRAM reset (restart, while screen is still black, hold down ⌘+Option+P+R and keep them pressed until you hear the startup sound a second time).\n\n*Open disk utility and repair permissions on the Macintosh HD partition. TWICE.\n\n*Start Boot Camp Assistant again.\n\n\nSeems hokey. With those instructions I thought I would also have to stand on one foot, point to my nose, rub my belly, and hope for rain.

That's when I decided to make a backup (Carbon Copy Cloner \"free trial\" copied my AFPS macOS to a 64gb SD Card) of my working macOS, booted from it, re-partition both of my hard drives and then restored my macOS to one of the SSDs, rebooted from my newly restored macOS and ran Bootcamp without a hitch, installing Windows in the other SDD. Something must have gone horribly wrong with the EFI partitions that wasn't allowing Windows setup to configure properly. Best trick, clean out your mess and start, almost, from scratch.\n\nA: I had the same error...\nfor me it is simply updating the ISO that I was using....\nseems like it was a problem with my old ISO file, after downloading a new version of windows 10 iso 64bit from Microsoft website it works\n\nA: Tried the other methods without success.\nFinally, the problem was solved by deleting the EFI information of Windows.\nFirst load the EFI volume, use the following command:\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1\n\nFind the directory EFI/Microsoft/Boot in the Finder, delete all the files in it.\nUnmount the EFI volume:\nsudo diskutil unmount disk0s1\n\nThen you can reinstall Windows 10.\nIt is recommended to use the ISO downloaded from Microsoft.\n", "Q: Can I hide software updates in Mavericks?

I have looked into the apple support communities but couldn't find anything. I have tried Cleaning the headphone jack on both devices and I have tried updating to iOS 7.0.6 AND iOS 7.1(I'm a developer). This issue has been bothering me and I would appreciate any help.\nThanks\n\nA: That sounds like a hardware issue with the EarPods. \nIf you have an apple store nearby you can take them in and try a new set. I've gotten one set of earbuds and one set of EarPods replaced with very little trouble. \n\nA: I think you should get a new pair of Earpods / Headphones.\nIt doesn't cost much, it should be around £25.00 (UK) and $29.00 (US). I have encountered this problem a lot of times, i'd buy a new pair. \n", "Q: How can I prevent FaceTime from launching when I plug in an external video camera? We have iMacs that we use as industrial control computers, and we connect FireWire cameras into them via Thunderbolt adapters. On previous OS X versions, we would have to go into the preferences for iChat / Messages and prevent them from automatically launching when these cameras were connected, to make sure those applications didn't mess with our own video software.\nHowever, on Mavericks these preferences have disappeared, apparently because now FaceTime is the application that automatically launches when an external FireWire camera is plugged in. \nFaceTime seems to lack any formal exposed preferences, so is there another way to disable the automatic launching of this application on the connection of an external camera (a preference setting written at the terminal, etc.)? If so, how would we do this?\n\nA: You can control which applications automatically open after attaching a camera to your Mac using the native Mac application, Image Capture. Try plugging in you camera and then launching Image Capture. If the camera is recognized by the app, there will be a drop down menu visible in the bottom left-hand corner of the app. Click the drop down menu to choose which application to automatically open when the camera is attached (in your case, choose \"No Application\"). \nIf for some reason Image Capture does not recognize your camera, the drop down menu will not be visible. In that case, I'm not sure how to fix your problem.\n\n\nA: The only solution that I found is to backup and then remove Facetime.app completely\n", "Q: Does free iWork iOS entitle older devices? I wonder whether old iOS devices would become entitled to install a free copy of iWork after purchasing a new device.\n\nA: Yes, providing you use the same Apple ID.

I can't find any way in the contact's Info window to change this.\n\nA: Figured it out: under Messages' Preferences: Accounts options, the sort order of the accounts controls the ordering when sending a message.

Can I completely remove Mac OS X from my system and install Windows 7 or 8 on it?\nI do not want to use Bootcamp or create VM's. Is there any way at all? \nThe problem here is that i want to ditch OSX and install Windows on my mac machine forever.\n\nWill I have to buy a Windows PC?\n\nA: No you don't need PC hardware since Yes you can delete OS X entirely after getting the drivers installed from Boot Camp on OS X.\nFollow the directions for creating the bootcamp USB key that comes with bootcamp (you'll need an 8GB key). When you boot from the bootcamp key and it gives you disk utility just delete the OSX partition (I believe this is an option, it's been a while) And make the whole thing Winders.\nThe Mac IS an Intel PC and Bootcamp is only the drivers and whatnot to create the bootable windows installer with the Mac drivers in it.\nHold onto that key, it's your repair disk and Windows re-installer should you need to sometime in the future.\n\nA: I've just succeeded in replacing OS X with Windows 10 on a late 2018 MacBook Pro with the touch bar.\nNOTE: you'll need an external USB keyboard (and perhaps mouse) because MacBook's ones won't work before you install the drivers. Steps to follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Boot Camp application on OS X and download the Boot Camp Support Software, i.e. a package containing all the Windows drivers you'll need to install and smoothly run Windows 10. You can download that package via the Action menu entry in the Boot Camp application.\n\n*Copy the content of the package to the root of a FAT32 USB pen (a 8GB pen will do the job).\n\n*Create a bootable USB Windows installer. I made it on another Windows 10 machine, but I guess it's possible to make it on OS X too.\n\n*Insert the Windows installer USB pen and reboot the MacBook Pro. Hold down the Option key until a boot menu appears. Boot from the Windows installer.\n\n*Chose the Custom installation. You'll be asked to chose the drive where to install Windows to, but you probably won't see any storage device. Hence, insert the Boot Camp drivers USB pen and press Load drivers. There, you can browse the pen and select the Apple SSD driver (I don't remember what is the exact folder you have to select, but it's not hard to find out).\n\n*Once the driver is installed, you can finally see your hard drive partitions. I deleted the OS X partition and created a new NTFS one.\n\n*Complete the installation. Once Windows is booted, run the setup.exe executable in the Boot Camp USB pen. That will install all the needed drivers (network, keyboard and touch-pad, ...).\n\n*Enjoy.\n", "Q: Preventing access to mounted volumes for non-admin users I have some volumes with sensitive data mounted in my main, admin account.\nI'd like to give some other users access to the same computer using a \"standard\" user account. Such a standard account seems to be effectively blocked from accessing any files which are inside the admin account's home folder, but all the mounted volumes are completely accessible.\nHow would I make such volumes inaccessible?\n\nA: Basically just take the permissions applied to your own home folder and apply them to the mounted volume. For example try sudo chown -R /Volumes/name-of-secure-volume yourusername:yourgroup\nThen use chmod -R 700 to change permissions so that only owner can access them, and group cannot edit or view (in case new users are members of the same group as you). Of course, if new users are able to sudo, then all bets are off unless you put the volume into a TrueCrypt container.

Is there a way to remove or move it, so the search bar is the first thing in the top right?\n\nA: You can do this with Bartender.\nThis allows you to rearrange and hide menu bar items, including items that Apple prohibit from moving such as Spotlight or Notification Center. It also lets you move items to a secondary bar or to be hidden until a keyboard shortcut is pressed.\n\nA: To kill the notification bar, type this:\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist && killall NotificationCenter\n\nIf you want to renable it, type:\nlaunchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist && killall NotificationCenter\n\nAs for moving it, so that the Spotlight function is first, I do not know. You can easily access Spotlight by keyboard using ⌘ Command+Space and that will quickly open Spotlight, and you can just start typing without having to move your mouse.\n", "Q: Accidentally almost deleted iPhoto library I was emptying out folders and deleting unnecessary items and as I went to my pictures folder I simply just dragged everything to the trash not knowing that my whole iPhoto library was there.\nWhen I hit empty trash a couple of seconds later I had realized what I had done and I hit cancel as it was in the process of deleting. Now when I try to open iPhoto it says \"Your photo library is either in use by another application or has become unreadable\".

I know if I toggle Airplane Mode, it will turn wifi and bluetooth on and off-- but I can manually toggle them. On an iPhone or cellular-enabled iPad, airplane mode kills the cell radio. But there's no cell radio in my wifi-only iPad! So what does airplane mode do for me?\n\nA: It's a feature kept on iOS so that you can quickly turn off both Wifi and Bluetooth. \n\nA: IIRC Airplane Mode will power down all radio circuitry. While you may not be using WiFi right now, the radio antenna is still live and potentially responding to background activity. I'll try to find some reference material with more details. \nUntil recently, commercial aircraft use radio systems which are susceptible to interference. For example, a helicopter coming in to land at night can click their 'click to talk' button on their radio and airports that support this will adjust the landing strip lighting (low, medium, high, repeat). \nThis is a similar principle to if you leave your phone next to a public announcement (PA) system or other microphone - you hear the occasional radio chatter over the speakers. \n\nA: You may want to conserve power while using apps that don't need a constantly on network connection, such as Kindle.app.\n", "Q: Time capsule not backing up Since many days, my time capsule, isn't making any backups.

(Need to transfer photos) From what I've read, in order to connect my iPad mini to my iPhone 5, I need (1) a lightning to 30 pin adapter, and (2) an iPad Cammera Connection Kit, which has a 30pin to USB adapter. This is a bit cumbersome, so is there just a connection kit for the iPad Mini?\nNote: I know that there are solutions such as iCloud and Dropbox, but those are limited in capacity, so I am looking to transfer photos to my iPad as another form of redundancy\n\nA: Yes, ipad mini has connectivity kit, since I have mine when I bought it but the truth is, I haven't been able to use it yet since I bought this last year!\nAnd one more thing about transferring photos, I think it's better to use Dropbox, I guess your photos would not be too much to occupy even the 100GB capacity, which I am now using. I have iphone4s and ipad mini and I just sync everything to Dropbox, it's much easier, no hassle and simply a lot of storage capacity than my phone. :-)\n", "Q: How do I log a defect against Google's gmail app? I'd like to lodge a defect against Google's gmail iphone app. Does anyone know where the public bug tracker is?\n\nA: I don't believe Google has a public bug tracker. However, there is an unofficial one available at code.google.com/p/googlebugs. I did some extra looking, and there doesn't seem to be anything like Apple's own bug reporter or the community-driven one. \nThankfully, Gmail.app has a built-in mechanism to send feedback with.

I am looking for a solution to have the AirPort WiFi or other icon in the menu bar show when an active Internet connection is established.\nI live in a funky WiFi connection area and connect true a router and extender. The router requires a password to connect. I use a WiFi extender to boost the signal from router.\nThe WiFi icon shows full connection in menu bar but that is only to the Extender.\nThe detail view for WiFi shows the following (left: active, right: not active):\n\nThe WiFi shows happy connection but it does not show missing internet connection.\nSometimes I lose the active Internet connection without knowing it and it is not been displayed in WiFi icon, but the Skype shows that, easy to see with a glance.\n\nAs a fix for that I use Skype that displays only when actually connected to Internet.\n\nCan I modify the AirPort WiFi in menu bar to blink or something when it has lost the actual Internet connection?\nI do not want to have Skype running to quickly see if I still have Internet.\nAnd I do not want to have to use Terminal or System Preferences to just to see if I am still connected. Eventually in my browser I will get the notification that the site is not available, or check your internet, or something like it.\n\nA: With regard to modifying the system AirPort icon, I do not believe that what you are asking for is possible.\nTo show internet connectivity, I use a combination of WiFi Signal (which could be substituted for the OS X AirPort menu bar item) and Cloud:\n\n\n*\n\n*AirPort off\n\n\n*AirPort on & not connected\n\n\n*AirPort connected & no internet\n\n\n*AirPort connected & internet\n\nThis works very well and takes up no more space on my menu bar as I use Cloud anyway.\nDropbox is also a good alternative as it also shows network connectivity, although it is slightly slower to respond especially on slower connections where the network test takes longer.\n\n\nA: Found a very simple App, Icon Ping\n\nThe world icon will change color accordingly to the state of the connection:\nGreen if we receive pong packets back from 8.8.8.8. Connection OK.\nYellow if we receive pong packets, but with a delay that is greater than 300 milliseconds. Connection Slow.\nRed if we don't receive pong packets for three seconds or more. Connetion not working.\n\nA: I made an AppleScript program that checks the internet using ping, and if it finds that your internet is down, it will alert you. You can get it here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/j4i9keisp8r79sm/Internet%20Test.app.zip\nIf you want to make it yourself, then here is the code:\nrepeat\n    try\n        do shell script \"ping -c 5 google.com\"\n    on error\n        display dialog \"You are not connected to the internet\"\n    end try\n    delay 15\nend repeat\n\nSet the application as a start up item. If your internet breaks, it will alert you. You can get a notification center alert instead of a dialog by changing the line after on error to read\ndisplay notification \"Internet is down\"\n\nAdded bonus: if you have a Router that will automatically disconnect you after certain time of inactivity, this will prevent that, since you are always showing as active.\n", "Q: How to edit the /etc/hosts file?

When you try, it asks permission, reminding you that you are not a member of the required group, but password entry will allow you to open and edit the file. Plus, it has optional command line additions (also not built in to App Store version) that will allow you to use TextWrangler by entering edit (name of file) to open things directly from Terminal. Open File dialog has a handy \"show invisibles\" option to help you open and edit hidden or dot-prefixed files too. It's a free app so no risk in trying. \n\nA: sudo nano /private/etc/hosts\n\nto edit the hosts file within Terminal, Control-O to save, then hit enter\n\nA: In one line, from Terminal:\n# Catalina and newer\nsudo -b /System/Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts\n\n# before Catalina\nsudo -b /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts\n\nMake your changes, save and close.\n\nA: If you like simple, you can research vim tool which installed on MacOS:\nsudo vi /etc/hosts\n\nA: I am in HighSierra, and I remember well from Lion and later until including HighSierra that you select \"Hosts\" and open it with Textedit without any ado.\n\nA: I'm using macOS Big Sur and this is what worked for me:\nsudo vi /etc/hosts\n\nAs opposed to next command that didn't work:\nsudo open /etc/hosts\n\nI got this error message\n\nYou don’t own the file “hosts” and don’t have permission to write to\nit.

I noticed that I could remount my USB hard drive through terminal after I eject it by typing diskutil list to find the drive and diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk\"X\"...\nSo I tried to do the same with my SD card and my USB flash drive but...after I eject them, I cannot find them anymore through diskutil list.\nI suspect this is because they are not \"drive\" until the system determines them as drives...which happens automatically when you plug them in - and the system remove those drives from the USB interfaces/SD card interfaces after I eject them.\nSo, the question is, how do I manually determine these USB interfaces/SD interfaces as \"drives\" so I can remount them. Thanks.\n\nA: There's a difference between unmounting and ejecting.\nI'm not familiar with the CLI of diskutil, so I'll explain it using Disk Utility.app\nWhen you have a mounted SD card you can unmount it by clicking the Unmount button in the Toolbar:\n\nThe SD card stays in the list, but it is faded out.\nThen if you want to remount it again, just select the SD card and click Mount:\n\n\nA: so I figured this out. First of, SD card and USB flash drive use different kernel in OS X, so the solution is not universal. Fist of, if you use USB flash drive:\nIn your terminal type\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext\n\nType your password (use an admin account), then\nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext\n\nWhat this does is that it unload and reload the USB storage kernel extension system wise, so it is an equivalent of unplug and replug your USB storage device after the ejection.\nSimilarly, we can do that with SD card reader too! Type:\nsudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleSDXC\nsudo kextload -b com.apple.driver.AppleSDXC\n\nTada!\nBe careful tho, once you unload the kernel and forget to reload the kernel, you will not be able to read the device at all even if you physically unplug and plugin the device.\n", "Q: Replacing \"apple hardware test\" with \"apple diagnostics\" According to this article, holding down the \"D\" key while my MacBookPro11,3 boots should bring up \"Apple Diagnostics\".

I can now boot into recovery mode, but I still have the problem described above.\nPlease do not answer this question if you don't understand the difference between \"Apple Hardware Test\" and \"Apple Diagnostics.\"  Linking me to Apple support and pointing out that \"Apple Diagnostics\" replaced \"Apple Hardware Test\" in mid-2013 (as the 2 current answers have done) does not answer my question.\n\nA: So you didn't write this much in your original post but I am going out on a limb and gonna say that the AHT that boots doesn't work on your Retina MBP.\nThe only way to get the file back is reinstall the OS via internet recovery but if the /System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics folder is there then I would wager a small bet that internet recovery won't put Apple Diagnostics on the drive. \nYou can test this by deleting the current folder on your MacBook Pro and then trying internet recovery. OR (I'd first recommend this) you could start your computer into Internet Recovery and reinstall the OS on an external drive. Once the install is done just copy over the aforementioned .diagnostics folder and then move it onto your MacBook Pro's internal drive.\nAll the best and much fun ahead! (Please give internet recovery 1-2 hours depending on your internet connection and ethernet is highly encouraged)\n\nA: The original AHT file is somewhat hidden.\nThe AHT is stuffed into an AHTxx.dmg file and found on the Recovery HD volume that is also hidden.\nFirst you have to make the hidden partitions visible\nTo enable the see all partitions in Disk Utility (the Debug Menu)\ndefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1\n\nIn Disk utility now there will be a tab called Debug.\nUse it to show hidden partition.\nYou will now see the Hidden partition called Recovery and EFI.\nMount the Recovery to see the files in finder and find the AHTxx.dmg\nDelete it since it does not work anyway and it is a left over.\nNow you can Disable the see all partitions in Disk utility (remove the Debug from the Tabs)\ndefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 0\n\nTo Show all hidden files\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE && killall Finder\n\nWhen done replace the TRUE with FALSE to hide hidden files.\nTry the Diagnostic mode.\nSince you do not have one anymore, the Internet version should come up automagicaly.\n\nA: You may want to look at the help provided here on identifying and downloading a new copy of AHT for your specific hardware.\nOnce you have AHT back in the .diagnostics folder (you may find you don't even have a .diagnostics folder now) you should be able to run AHT using the 'd' key on startup.\n\nA: For me (according to this page http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11342) it sounds like Apple called the same feature \"Apple Hardware Test\" on Macs before mid-2013 and \"Apple Diagnostics\" after mid-2013. But I'm not sure on that. I really never heard the word \"Apple Diagnostics\" before I read your question.\n", "Q: Where are the /dev folder and the /dev/null device located on Mac OS X Mountain Lion? I am trying to find them on my Mac OS X Mountain Lion and it seems they do not exist. \nI do not think it is a problem of folders privileges.\nMaybe it just doesn't exit and I have to create them. \n\nA: It should be there as a character special file:\nbash-3.2# cd /dev\nbash-3.2# ls -l |grep null\ncrw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel       3,   2 Mar  8 11:04 null\n\nFinder doesn't show these folders so you need to be in terminal to see them.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 won't connect to the internet except on wifi My iphone 4 won't connect to the internet except using wifi. I've reset the device, turned off and on airplane mode, called AT&T where they instructed me to reset network settings, cleared cookies, history and web sites history. Still nothing except on wifi. The phone makes and receives phone calls and text messages fine. Any other suggestions?\n\nA: You have done many of the quick fixes, but the best guideline on troubleshooting this would be to re-start the troubleshooting process:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3780\nBefore you start, do you have a backup of your device?\nAlso, you can test the data connection with some very simple items to rule out Mobile Safari or other items being blocked.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings App - turn off Wi-Fi\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> Date & Time and turn off \"Set Automatically\" and then intentionally set the clock back 10 minutes in the past.\n\n*Turn off the phone.\n\n*Turn on the phone - verifying WiFi is still off and the date is still set incorrectly and in the past.\n\n*Go to Date & Time and turn on \"Set Automatically\" and see if the date can be set from AT&T's network connection.\n\n\nAt that point, I would then go through the steps in the above article, noting on a piece of paper what results you get. That way should you need to contact AT&T or Apple - they can't give you the run around. It is Apple's responsibility to explain how to test the device up to and including restore / erase and setting it up new. It's AT&T's responsibility to ensure your data service is working if you are paying for it. You can not give them an easy out if you document your efforts to solve it and have done all the things that are expected of the end user.\nHopefully something simple like a power cycle and eliminating the WiFi will allow the cellular data to start working again, but it still could be something out of your control and you'll need help from Apple or AT&T to finally solve it.\n", "Q: Is there a solution for preventing battery drain on the 5s after the iOS 7.0.6 update? I have tried a hard reset, removing Outlook email account, and closing all apps and turning off Background App Refresh.\n\nA: This question was answered by updating to iOS 7.1. I've since turned all  the features of the phone back on (e.g., background app refresh, notifications, use my location, all the processes that I tuned off trying to troubleshoot) and my phone just lasted three days with normal use.\n", "Q: What is localhost.pharos from Netstat? Over past week, netstat reflects an established connection to localhost.pharos.\nGoogled Pharos and it's a software which enables printing services at Universities/Enterprises. \nAny ideas why connection is constant at each login? \nProto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)    \ntcp6       0      0  localhost.pharos       localhost.49437        ESTABLISHED\ntcp6       0      0  localhost.49437        localhost.pharos       ESTABLISHED\ntcp6       0      0  localhost.krb524       localhost.49436        ESTABLISHED\ntcp6       0      0  localhost.49436        localhost.krb524       ESTABLISHED\n\nA: pharos and krb524 are both just guesses about network services, based on the service <-> port number listings in /etc/services; in this case I'm fairly sure they're both wrong guesses, so just think of them as identifiers for port numbers 4443 and 4444 respectively. To  find out what's really going on, you need to find out what programs are connecting via those ports. You can do this with the lsof commands, like this:\nsudo lsof -i:pharos -i:krb524\n\n(you'll need to enter your admin password for sudo to get root access.) In the output, the important bits are the first two columns, which list the program (\"command\") names and process IDs of the processes that are using these ports. If the program name doesn't tell you what's going on, you can use ps and/or Activity Monitor to investigate those processes in more detail.\nEDIT: If I'm reconstructing the lsof output correctly, it looks like this:\nCOMMAND   PID          USER  FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\ncollabd    237 _teamsserver  7u   IPv6 0x7da9dd76981ec947      0t0  TCP localhost:pharos->localhost:50603 (ESTABLISHED\nruby       323 _teamsserver  31u  IPv6 0x7da9dd76981eeb47      0t0  TCP localhost:50602->localhost:krb524 (CLOSE_WAIT)\nxcsbuildd 6943 _teamsserver  8u   IPv6 0x7da9dd76981ecd87      0t0  TCP localhost:50603->localhost:pharos (ESTABLISHED)\n\nThose all look like components of OS X Server -- I'm not very familiar with the details, but collabd is a background process relating to \"collaborative services\" parts of OS X server, and the _teamserver user ID is used for those services.  From comparing to my server, it looks like the ruby script handles notifications, and xcsbuildd is probably the Xcode build server. Apparently, they all talk to each other over ports 4443 and 4444.\n", "Q: Looking for a word processor with the power of Markdown Basically, I am looking for a word editor (like Word or Pages) that is compatible with Markdown.

I got an old Apple iBook (second generation G3 if I'm not mistaken) without an Airport Card.\nAre there any other options to access the internet on it besides the ethernet port?\nCould I share the WiFi from a smartphone with the iBook or something like that?\n\nA: That is going to be tricky because any new usb wifi adapters are probably not going to have the driver support with the OS you are going to be using. \n(If you are right about the model the maximum OS is 10.4.11.)\nAmazon has original airport cards for sale and it looks like they aren't too expensive compared to newer adapters (~$20).

I have an old iMac for the kids: iMac 8,1 Core2 Duo with 3GB (2+1) RAM that was recently upgraded it to Mavericks 10.9\n\nIt's running quite slow; free RAM is always pretty low. Apps run \"OK\" once open; it's mainly switching between apps, loading apps, and booting up which take forever.\nMy question is how can I know if installing a 120 GB SSD (lying around) likely give me significant performance boost or if instead I need to upgrade RAM (which will cost me)?\nI replaced with SSD -- seems faster -- but follow up here: Best version of OSX for 2008 iMac?\n\nA: According to your comment, it looks as if you could do better with more RAM. If it was just launching slowly, then I would say the SSD, but since its switching apps also, I think more RAM would be nice. Unless your iMac ran a lot better under Mountain Lion or below, I really wouldn't downgrade.\nBTW: Don't disable the user accounts. Just log off when you are not using that user account.\nSince you have a spare SSD, you could also just connect it externally using an inexpensive USB to SATA adapter and install new OS on it and run some A/B tests. You won't see the full speed of an internal placement - especially if you use USB 2.0, but it's often enough to know rule out RAM or OS as a cause of slowness.\n", "Q: Refresh my current location iPhone Many apps use your \"current location\" (or what they think is your current location), to make ads relevant to where you are, and other location related app features seem to use this information. Pandora, Spotify, etc. for example play audio ads for businesses near where they think you are. \nI went to school in Iowa, but have been living in Chicago Area for 9 months now - yet all of my ads are for businesses in the Iowa City area, among other location based features throughout apps. \nIs it possible to update what these apps think you current location is?

To restore my iPhone I am required to turn off \"Find my iPhone\".\nSince I can't get access to wifi through my device (it needs Apple ID password), how can I turn the that off?\nI tried doing it through iCloud.com but it needs to be turned off through the device itself (which then eventually shows on iTunes).\nI've contacted the Apple support team but they haven't helped much.\n\nA: You can restore your device by putting it in Recovery Mode first. This will restore your device regardless of settings on the device, including Find my iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn your device off.\n\n*Hold Home as you connect the USB cable until you see the following screen:\n\n\n*You should see the following message in iTunes:\n\niTunes has detected an iPhone in recovery mode.

Obviously a thief would not necessarily have ID and wish not to be tracked\n", "Q: iPhoto pictures lost, then found - how to save them to hard drive My iPhoto library became corrupted and no longer opened in iPhoto. (No, unfortunately I don't have a backup on Time Machine or other.) I thought the 26,000 photos were lost (since the iPhoto Library Package \"shrunk\" from 85 GB to 1 GB) but they have been found in a separate \"lost+found\" folder (it was found in the root directory next to \"Applications\" and \"Library\"). My question is about how to start over with iPhoto.  \nHere is what I've done so far:  I've started copying folder by folder from Finder to an external hard drive, and deleting the \"corrupted\" images as they are identified.  All the photos are scattered in a complicated hierarchy of folders with the parent folder names being successive years, like this:\n2001\n - then under that - 01 (there are 10-15 of these types of folders)\n - then under that - 01 (also 10-15 of these)\n - then under that - 20130101-132905 (there are 50-60 of these types of folders)\nThis goes on and on through 2014.\nDo I need to keep these folders intact?\nWhat I want to do is save all my photos to my hard drive, then wipe my laptop clean and install OSX Mavericks, then re-install iPhoto, re-import all the images, and start over with making events, albums and face recognition.\nBack to the folder structure, within the \"lost+found\" folder there is a duplicate set of folders with the same names, but along with the image files, there are more files with the same name but with \"faces01\" and such tacked on the end.  What I understand this to be has to do with the facial recognition in iPhoto.  Do I need to keep all of those image files too if I'm willing to just start over??  My reasoning is that since these appear to be just a bunch of files and no longer an iPhoto Library Package, then iPhoto would simply recognize those \"face\" images as new photos and I don't want that.\nIn addition, there are some files like iMovie Data, AlbumData, Photo Database, and a folder called Segments.  Do I need to keep those if I'm happy with just starting over?\nI would just as soon keep ONLY the images and simply re-import them into iPhoto once I get my laptop running good again, but I thought I'd post on here and get any suggestions or advice before doing so.\n\nA: If you are fine with starting over with albums and face recognition, don't worry about the folder structure. The metadata on the photos (assuming they are JPEGs) will even give you back a lot of events. (iPhoto makes events automatically using the timestamps). \nI think face-recognition and keywords and ratings and all of that is going to be gone, but just save the image files you want to keep and forget about the rest. \n", "Q: Are Apple boot camp drivers excellent on Windows 7? First off, I realize some may not prefer Windows, but I like Windows, and I like Apple's hardware so let's set aside any preferences on OS and focus on how well I can expect Boot Camp to run for me.\nI'm considering purchasing a macbook for my upcoming graduation. I'm stuck between the 13\" air and the 13\" pro with retina. Either way, I'm planning on getting the 256GB model with 8GB of RAM. I also plan on dual booting with Windows 7. I can't find a reference that comments on how well Apple's Windows drivers work to make the multi touch trackpad work as well in Windows as it does on OS X.\nWill I be sacrificing trackpad input capabilities by choosing Mac hardware over another PC vendor (either due to hardware limitations or driver issues)?\n\nA: In my experience, if found that Windows runs great on my MBP 15''.\nDrivers installation is very easy using Bootcamp.\nActually, a study has shown that MBP was the best performing laptop for running Windows operating system.\nI would recommend to use a mouse on Windows. I am not very comfortable with the touchpad but it's more a personal thing, so you should give it a try and decide for yourself.\nIf you choose to buy a MBP retina and you connect to Internet using the Ethernet Thunderbolt adapter, be sure to connect it at boot time like described in this other post.\n", "Q: How to install Dropbox on iPhone 3GS? How can I install the Dropbox app on an iPhone 3GS running iOS 6.1.6? THe newest version of the app is iOS7-only.\nI've heard that if the app has been installed under your account, the App Store will let you use the last compatible version, but I have no devices running iOS7 to add it to my account with.\nHow can I get the Dropbox app onto this phone? The iPhone is jailbroken.\n\nA: Indeed, it will let you download the last compatible version if you already have the app in your purchase history. You can add the app to your purchase history using iTunes on your computer, since iTunes is version-agnostic. Once you've downloaded the app on iTunes, it will be in your purchase history and attempting to download it again on your device should prompt you to accept an older version of the app.\n\nA: If Dropbox is just compatible with iOs 7 then it would make a difference if you'll install it in your phone. It wouldn't run at all. Even your phone is jailbroken already, you can't find or install it from Cydia. It will just be from the Appstore. \nI am using 4s running ios7.0.6 btw. \n", "Q: Convert a bunch of MKV files to MP4 to read them in iTunes I have a bunch of mkv files that are encoded as MPEG-4 video and AC-3 audio.

What is the rationale behind requiring Wi-Fi to backup to iCloud from my iOS device? What is wrong with using 3G or 4G to backup?\n\nA: Without going into speculation, there appears to be no official word on why this has been done. There are a number of iCloud Backup KB articles, mentioning that Wi-Fi is the only way to backup your device:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/icloud/backup/\n…however, per almost all Apple documentation of this sort, there is no reasoning to their decisions.\nIf you need to connect over 3G/4G - you can tether to another iOS device and then backups see WiFi and progress smoothly in my experience. There doesn't appear to be any opt-in choice to self-backup. http://feedback.apple.com would be the only avenue to ask for this feature going forward.\n\nA: Let me speculate for the logic behind the decision, since there is no published reason per @grgarside.\nMaking you (or forcing) to use the 3G or 4G will use your personal Telephone providers network that in all case you pay money for.\nIn some cases this can be expensive (depending on data plan you have), and in other cases with limitations how much can you transfer.\nUsing WiFi is considered open network, in many case you do not pay for it (public), and no limit how much you can transfer.\nI agree Apple could make it a choice (for you to choose), but lacking that feature, the safe choice is WiFi.\n\nA: There used to be a limit on the size of apps you could download over the cell network - I believe 10MB was the first limit.  This was put in place on the device by apple because AT&T (who initially was only offering unlimited data packages) still wanted to not have people download gigantic things over the cell network.  I also believe a similar thing occurred initially with a lot of streaming apps, where if they are on the cell network they'll push a lower quality video/audio, or simply say wifi-only.  All these regulations don't make as much sense anymore now that many plans are pay-per-byte, but there are still many that are not (especially in the USA)\n", "Q: How to make a playable DVD iso from a VIDEO_TS folder? I used to have a script that converts a VIDEO_TS folder into an ISO that plays ok in VLC but it's gone.\nAnyway, this command gets me most of the way there:\nhdiutil makehybrid -udf -udf-volume-name $folder -o $fullpath.iso $fullpath\n\nExcept that when I tried it on one DVD, it skips the menu selection. Is this likely a problem with the one DVD I tried or do I need a different tool / different options to get the menu to render properly?\n\nA: just tried this on several VIDEO_TS and works perfectly.\nhdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -udf -udf-volume-name $folder -o $fullpath.iso $fullpath\n\nps. I've never found out how to make ISOs out of VIDEO_TS using handbrake. I don't think this is possible.\n", "Q: Lost my \"Artists\" field in iTunes Most of my old CDs that I'm adding to my iPod touch 4th generation are compilations, so I have to add in the details my hand. I accidentally got rid of the \"Artists\" column in iTunes, which made it nice if I wanted to sort by artist.\nHow do I get that field back, and do I have to re-enter each artist for several hundred songs by hand?\n\nA: Right-click on the column headings and select Artist to add the column back.\n\nYou won't need to re-enter information for the songs since the information will not have been deleted.\n", "Q: convert 30 pin docks for lightning devices I recently upgraded from an Iphone 4 to a 5s.\nI have 4 different docks that worked with all my previous Iphones and Ipods - I just swapped out a cheap plastic holder around the connector that could hold my new device.\n\nThey sell two adapters for this in the Apple store, but it's useless for me since:\n\n\n*\n\n*It costs £25 per adapter. That's £100 ($160) for the 4 docks, which is insane\n\n*The short one is an inch long and doesn't hold the base of the phone (the way every dock expects) which means that the phone will just fall over if I try to use it.\n\n*The long one also doesn't support my Iphone in a vertical position\n\n\nI need an adapter that sits on an old Apple dock, but that holds the base of the phone so that it stays upright.\nI can't find anything that does this online, and most of what I can find states that it can't support audio in the small print. When I ask in shops they look at me like I'm crazy and then try to sell me a USB cable.\n90% of the Iphone docks sold still have the the (now obsolete) old Apple connector. It seems like a massive oversight that nobody makes a dock adapter.\nAre there commercial sources of 30 pin dock adapters that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Support audio function equivalent to apple’s 30 pin to lightning adapters. \n\n*Holds the phone upright (y'know, as if in a phone dock)\n\n*Optionally include the adapter so I don't need both a prop and a cable/dongle to replicate the old drop-in flip function of these docks. \n\n*(Ideally) is reasonably priced \n\n\nA: My solution to your problem is to use the longer 30 pin to lightning adapter and lie the phone down rather than prop it up dock style, but I get the convenience of just dropping in a phone on any dock and not having to repurpose/recycle otherwise functional docks prematurely. I also just use one cable and bring it with my device rather than fixing all the docks (as I still use them with 30 pin devices more than I do with lightning devices).\nIf you don't mind the longer cable, get the Cradle with Audio port from Belkin - especially if you want the analog audio option or don't want to add height on top of the docking station.\n\nIf you need a commercial insert, the best one out is the Kickstarted project that ended funding 31 Jan 2013 that now sells the Flybridge insert commercially in packs of 1, 2 and 5 to save on both shipping and the per-unit cost.\n\nSince these have been in the wild for more than a year, I've not heard of major problems and you might even find someone to fabricate a similar plastic insert if for some reason you don't want an injection molded piece or your docks aren't among the ones listed as compatible with the product.\n\nA: This isn't going to be a very graceful answer, but if the 4 items you were docking with before have 3.5mm audio in, you can get an Apple iPhone 5s dock ($29) which has line out and will support your iPhone in an upright position. \nIt will not, however adapt your old dock to interface with the item in any of the other ways you are used to.\n\nA: You could fashion a makeshift dock out of matchsticks. I'd recommend removing the sulfer from the strikey end first to avoid any unwanted housefires but with some model glue, if you were really careful you could put together a decent support structure that would keep your phone upright when you wanted to dock it. \n", "Q: Is iTunes for Windows affected by the code responsible for the goto fail vulnerability? I've been reading about the infamous \"goto fail\" security bug in iOS 6 and OS X 10.9, but I haven't read anything about whether other Apple software, like for example iTunes for Windows, is affected. This is relevant since, after all, iTunes is the software you use to access your Apple account and update your credit card information.\nSince I haven't read anything about it, I assume that it isn't affected... but am I wrong? Has anyone tried verifying whether iTunes is safe?\n\nA: The \"goto fail\" bug was part of a OS X library that checked that a valid SSL certificate also matched the host records it was exchanging traffic with.\nSince many applications use SSL first identify a web site securely and then encrypt the traffic, having the library in the core OS lets each program not have to do the work to validate a cert. By patching/fixing this library the problem is solved for all applications that relied on that fucntion.\nOn OS X, iTuned relied on the system to validate SSL certs and thus didn't need a patch. There isn't a published vulnerability listed (yet) for iTunes for Windows, so you should be in the clear for that one issue. \nOf course iTunes could have other security issues that aren't published or patched yet, but there's not any evidence that Windows iTunes is vulnerable today to the same code problem.\n", "Q: Preventing iCloud from syncing internet accounts in OS X Mavericks I have an email account that I wish to add to only one computer.\nUnfortunately when I create the account, iCloud automatically syncs it with my other machines.\nAny way to prevent it from doing that?\n\nA: iCloud syncs Internet Accounts through the Keychain. You can disable Internet Accounts syncing by disabling the Keychain service in System Preferences → iCloud.\n", "Q: Dual VGA monitors (not mirrored) with Mac mini 2012 Is it possible to do this some way? I need to work with to different monitors, not simply mirroring.\n\nA: Well, the Mac mini should include both an HDMI connector, as well as a Thunderbolt connector.   \nIf you are actually using VGA monitors with VGA connectors, you would simply need one HDMI -> VGA adaptor for one monitor, and one Thunderbolt -> VGA adaptor for the other.  \nIf your monitors are newer, you might like out and one will already have an HDMI connector, so no adaptor is needed.\nBut the simple answer to your question is YES, you just need to buy the appropriate adaptors for the connections you have.\n", "Q: Converting AVCHD files to mp4 I have recently recorded some college lectures using my Canon handycam.\nThe files I seem to have are in AVCHD format.\nI'd like to know if there is a relatively fast method to convert them into .mp4 format.\nI bought iMovie but with dismay I have been totally defeated by its interface. \nI was thinking of using ffmpeg but thought I'd ask the question here first.\nThanks.\n\nA: Handbrake should be able to handle AVCHD files. It relies on some codec library files from VLC player, so it may help to have that installed as well. Handbrake uses ffmpeg underneath the hood.\nAlternatively, AVIdemux may also be useful. It's a bit more of an editor than just an encoder, but if it can read the source files, it should be able to output the desired encoding.\nCommercially, SmartConverterPro has worked okay for me.\n\nA: Try out Handbrake, it's the best and free converter I've used on my Mac. The interface is easy and pretty straight forward.\n\nA: You can access the individual video files inside an AVCHD archive.  Right-click the AVCHD file in Finder and select Show Package Contents.  Then, inside the package will be a file called BDMV.  Again, right-click on BDMV and Show Package Contents.  Here in the STREAM directory are .MTS files for each video.  These can be opened or converted with tools like QuickTime or VLC (which has more exporting options). \nI've only checked the output of my camera — the directory structure or naming might be different for different cameras — but I believe that in all cases there are individual video files to be found inside the archive.\n", "Q: How to set Mail.app to ask what is the sending address on new mail I have 10 email addresses (ranging from POP, IMAP, and Exchange) setup in my Mail.app. There are 2 addresses I use primarily. But only one can be labeled Default. Therefore, when \"inbox\" is selected, and a new email is created, it is automatically sending from Default.\nIs there ANY way to set Mail.app to ask me which email address I want to send from if it is a newly created email (and not a reply to an email I've received, in reply situations I have no issue)?\nOnce I hit send, it should then ask me from what address to send from.\n\nA: The easiest way (at least the one I know of) is simply selecting the mailbox on the left you want to send from, and then click the new mail icon.\nIt will put as send-address the mailbox you selected on the left.\nYou can always use the dropdown afterwards if you want it to be another address, but that's the easiest way.\nTo make it more convenient, set the boxes as top 2 and you can easily select one of both.\n", "Q: Any way to send messages to Mavericks Notification Center from another machine on the local network? I need a way to have a Linux-based machine send a message that can be received and displayed by the Mavericks Notification Center. I used to do this on an older version of OS X by running Growl, and using its built-in ability to listen for incoming notifications. On the Linux box, I run a Perl script that uses the Net:Growl module to send the notifications. This was simple and worked well, but since everything is moving from Growl to Notification Center I'd like to be able to use that under Mavericks.\nAs far as I can tell, Notification Center has no way to receive incoming messages from another system on the network and post them. Is there really no way to do that, or am I just missing it?\nMy other thought was that if I could send the message as a Bonjour message then iChat could display it, but I don't know of any way to have a script send a Bonjour message from a Linux box. Note that the Linux box is a server, and therefore has no desktop or GUI.\nI was hoping that perhaps someone else has run into this and has figured out a way to push notifications from another machine on the local network and display them in Notification Center. If so, would you please be so kind as to tell me how you did it, or perhaps point me to a useful page that explains the procedure?\n\nA: You could ssh to the destination machine and run the following for each notification.\nosascript -e 'display notification \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\" with title \"Title\"'\n\nAlternatively, there are a number of ways of running AppleScript remotely. You can do it with Keyboard Maestro, which allows you to run macros (that can run AppleScript) over the network:\n\n\nA: EDIT: I missed that you want a linux based machine as your source.\nThe following is Mac to Mac using Applescript:\ntell application \"Finder\" of machine \"eppc://UserName:Password@Computer.local\"\n        display notification \"This is the message body.\" with title \"Message Title\" with subtitle \"Message Subtitle\"\nend tell\n\nApplescript. No need for Growl. Depending on notification settings this will either display for a couple seconds and then disappear or it will stay on the screen until the user clicks \"Close\"\n", "Q: Is there a way to detect what program is stealing focus on my Mac? I've got a problem with some app on my Mac stealing the keyboard focus (the current window's title bar becomes inactive). However, it is not actually putting up any windows or menu bar of its own, and it does not respond identifiably to keyboard shortcuts.\nIs there a way to determine what application has the keyboard focus even if it is one of those which has no menu bar or Dock icon? I know of one built-in feature that almost does this; the Force Quit dialog, if invoked from the keyboard, will open with the focused application selected. However, it only lists normal has-a-dock-icon applications, so it doesn't help in this case.\nThis started occurring around the time when I upgraded from 10.8 to 10.9; I suspect that one of the apps I already had installed, or upgraded along with the OS, is newly misbehaving.\nI am open to solutions involving a small amount of programming (or AppleScript, say), use of developer tools, etc.; but not ones like “Uninstall things until it goes away” because that would be excessively disruptive at the moment. I'd like to definitively identify the application and file a bug report or fix its configuration.\nMy research has only turned up a couple of threads requesting the same on Apple Support Communities which did not contain an answer.\n\nA: Here is improved version of script mentioned in @Ace’s answer:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# Prints current window focus.\n# See: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/123730\nfrom AppKit import NSWorkspace\nimport time\nworkspace = NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace()\nactive_app = workspace.activeApplication()['NSApplicationName']\nprint('Active focus: ' + active_app)\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    prev_app = active_app\n    active_app = workspace.activeApplication()['NSApplicationName']\n    if prev_app != active_app:\n        print('Focus changed to: ' + active_app)\n\nIt will print the name of the active application that has the focus and will detect if it changed by checking every second.\nRelated script: Identify which app or process is stealing focus on OSX at Gist\nUsage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the above script into a file get_active_focus.py.\n\n*Assign execution attributes with the chmod +x get_active_focus.py command.\n\n*Run the file with ./get_active_focus.py.\n\n\nOutput:\n$ ./get_active_focus.py\nActive focus: Terminal\nFocus changed to: Google Chrome\n\n\nA: While it isn't the primary purpose of this application, Karabiner-Elements (a tool for selectively remapping the keyboard) has a focus-change event log which will tell you which application has been stealing focus. While its intended purpose is to set up per-application keyboard mappings, it also has the nice side effect of telling you when a misbehaving app is making things difficult, and I have used it to track down several problem applications.\nThe method that Karabiner-Elements uses also works better with applications which steal the focus and immediately give it back (unlike the various Python scripts posted in other answers, which can only reliably log focus steals that last for more than one second).\n\nA: You can find the app that steals focus by saving the following code in a find_focus_stealer.py file and running it via python find_focus_stealer.py in a terminal.\nStart running the script – it will print out the name of the active app every 3 seconds. Keep working as usual, wait for the problem to occur, and after a few seconds see the output in the terminal. You’ll have your culprit.\nIn my case it was a Symantec Antivirus background app (SymUIAgent.app).\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nfrom AppKit import NSWorkspace\nimport time\nt = range(1,100)\nfor i in t:\n    time.sleep(3)\n    activeAppName = NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace().activeApplication()['NSApplicationName']\n    print activeAppName\n\nCredits to iMichael_ in this Apple Discussions thread.\n\nA: Here’s a slight update to @Ace’s script that runs until you kill it and only prints the app name when it changes. Again, save this code in a file find_focus_stealer.py and then try running it with python find_focus_stealer.py.\n#!/usr/bin/python                                                                                                       \n\ntry:\n    from AppKit import NSWorkspace\nexcept ImportError:\n    print \"Can't import AppKit -- maybe you're running python from brew?\"\n    print \"Try running with Apple's /usr/bin/python instead.\"\n    exit(1)\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom time import sleep\n\nlast_active_name = None\nwhile True:\n    active_app = NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace().activeApplication()\n    if active_app['NSApplicationName'] != last_active_name:\n        last_active_name = active_app['NSApplicationName']\n        print '%s: %s [%s]' % (\n            datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),\n            active_app['NSApplicationName'],\n            active_app['NSApplicationPath']\n        )\n    sleep(1)\n\nI was able to use this to track down “Google Drive” as the focus-stealing culprit on my Mac.\n\nA: Perhaps checking Activity Monitor for active processes? Anything in App Nap state could easily be ruled out, and it might make the hunt a lot shorter.\n", "Q: Inkscape on OSX copies rasterized images from SVG I'm trying to copy an object out of an SVG file using inkscape, however when I paste it back in to a new inkscape file it's no longer the svg version, but a rasterized version.\nI'm not sure if it's because inkscape runs in XQuartz and the clipboard is behaving odly.\n\nA: I solved this problem by importing another svg file into the current one.\nFile --> Import... --> Select \"All Vectors\" (or \"*.svg\") in the filter selection menu.\nThis copies the entire content of the imported file into the current one in vector format.\n\nA: Here someone had the same problem.\nThey solved it by turning off X11's Pasteboard Syncing:\n\nDisabling ‘Sync PasteBoard’ Functionality within X11 (Which is\n  Included in XQuartz App for OSX Mountain Lion) solves the problem of\n  converting vector object to Bitmap after pasting the same object in\n  another SVG file.\nDo This (Go to): X11 > Click on ‘Preferences’ tab > Choose\n  ‘Pasteboard’ tab > Uncheck ‘Enable Syncing’\n\n\nA: This is not really a solution but a workaround I learned from this page and it requires you to flex those muscle memory of CommandC and then CommandV.\nThe workaround is to use ControlD to duplicate instead of copy and pasting. Off course this does not work if you want to copy from one file to another or in/out of Inkscape. \n(It is a shame that Inkscape developers are ignoring all mac users. Looking forwards to see a real native implementation away from crappy X11!)\n", "Q: Why does my Mac Mini (2012) lock up with a fresh Mavericks install? I've reinstalled OS X Mavericks from scratch twice on my (usually headless) Mac Mini, but it keeps locking up after ten or fifteen minutes of use - even just Safari browsing. I use Screen Sharing with the firewall off (for now - to rule that out as a cause of the problem).\nI connected an HDTV to see what was going on when the Mini locked up and I saw this:\n\n...which doesn't look good.\nI've run a full 'memtest' in single-user mode, twice, and that says it's OK.

I have a 2011 MacBook Air(11-inch), I am using OS X 10.9, but I only have 64GB Flash Storage, and I  want to expand the storage of MacBook Air's hard disk. I asked geniuses at Apple and they told me the answer is no. So, is this possible?\n\nA: It is possible, although not from Apple themselves.\nA company called OWC seem to specialise in SSD upgrades for macbook's and have upgrades for your model available here\nThese particular upgrades offer greater speed and capacity to some of the stock apple SSD's from 2011. \n\nA: I might also recommend you check out a micro USB drive.  Kingston makes one called the DataTraveler micro.  It's very small and only protrudes out from the computer a little.  You can get them up to size 64GB currently.\n\nA: You could also ad a Nifty Drive to your mac. You plug that in your SD-Card reader (which is used by that then). http://eu.theniftyminidrive.com\nIt is slower than an SSD, but you could move some stuff over there. \n", "Q: Removing a given email synced to my iPad? I set my work gmail account to my personal iPad and now I don't have that job.

That would need a working connection and/or you to log in to the account at http://gmail.com or the URL they set up for your business log in.\n", "Q: Does Secure Empty Trash actually write random patterns of data? \nThis works by writing random patterns of data over a trashed file\n  immediately after it has been emptied,\n\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2012/02/03/secure-empty-trash-mac-os-x/\nDoes Secure Empty Trash actually write random patterns of data? I find it odd because, as far as I'm concerned, writing a bunch of 0s is more than enough to make your data inaccessible.\nI couldn't find an Apple document saying this, but it seems to me like a pretty strong statement so they probably had a source somewhere. Is there any truth to this?\n\nA: tl;dr: I don’t know, but I have some interesting links.\nAn Apple security white paper from Oct 2012/Mountain Lion confirms that it’s only a single-pass erase:\n\nUsers can also initiate sanitization while deleting files using the Secure Empty Trash command in the Finder. This command overwrites files as they are deleted using a single-pass erase.\n\nbut doesn’t say whether it’s a lot of zeroes, or random data.\nIn Disk Utility on Mavericks, the single-pass erase tool only uses a pass of zeroes:\n\nThis option writes a single pass of zeros over the entire disk. It erases the information used to access your files and writes over the data 1 time.\n\nIt’s not clear if the two implementations are exactly the same.\nIt might be a little stronger than that. The tool underlying Secure Empty Trash is a command line tool called srm (Secure ReMove). According to the Wikipedia page:\n\nMac OS X interfaces to srm, such as the \"Secure Empty Trash\" menu item in the Finder, use the DOD-recommended 7-pass algorithm, although srm uses the 35-pass version by default.\n\n7-passes includes four passes of random data, and then there passes of repeating data. You can see the full list on the Wikipedia page about the Gutmann method, which is what srm uses. Unfortunately, that doesn’t come with a reference.\nI have an old Mac OS X book (Mac OS X Power Tools, iirc) which also says that 7-pass overwrite is used for Secure Empty Trash, but again no mention of whether it’s zeroes or random data. It’s possible that the Wikipedia page is out-of-date, and that Apple has toned it back over the years.\nCertainly, the most secure erasure option available in Disk Utility has been scaled back in the last few releases. A few versions ago, the full 35-pass option was available there:\n\nIn Mavericks, the best option only uses 7-passes:\n\nHowever, the srm man page in Mavericks still makes reference to the 35-pass algorithm \n\nThe -s option  overrides the -m option, if both are present. If neither is specified, the 35-pass Gutmann algorithm is used.\n\nPresumably the option still exists, but you need to go to the command line to do it. (There’s more good discussion of this on the Security Stack Exchange site.)\n\n\nI find it odd because, as far as I'm concerned, writing a bunch of 0s is more than enough to make your data inaccessible.\n\nIt depends on how inaccessible you want your data to be. For a home user, that mine be fine. If you work for the military or the defence sector, perhaps less so. In theory, somebody with suitable equipment could read the original magnetic pattern from the disk if it’s not broken up properly. Using random data instead of zeroes makes it that much harder to read the original.
