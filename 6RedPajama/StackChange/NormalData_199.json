["Q: How to control Graphical programs from terminal? I am trying to control Inkscape program from terminal; for example, I want to open the File menu, Edit menu or Extensions menu in Inkscape from the terminal without the need to click on the menu from the program itself.\nI have searched a lot but I couldn't find an answer for my problem. How do I control Graphical programs from terminal?\n\nA: I'm pretty sure that ldtp can help you to automate Inkscape GUI. First open a terminal and install the python bindings:\nsudo apt-get install python-ldtp\n\nThen start the python interpreter:\n$ python\nPython 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) \n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from ldtp import *\n>>> launchapp('inkscape')\n25362\n>>> GTK Accessibility Module initialized\n>>> selectmenuitem('*Inkscape', 'mnuExtensions')\n\nor create a dedicated script with the following snippet:\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\n\nfrom ldtp import *\nimport time\n\nlaunchapp('inkscape')\nwaittillguiexist('*-Inkscape')\nselectmenuitem('*-Inkscape', 'mnuExtensions')\ntime.sleep(2)\nselectmenuitem('*-Inkscape', 'mnuEdit')\ntime.sleep(2)\nselectmenuitem('*-Inkscape', 'mnuFile')\ntime.sleep(2)\nselectmenuitem('*-Inkscape', 'mnuQuit')\nwaittillguinotexist('*-Inkscape')\n\nKnowing all the GUI component names is a bit hard since ldtpeditor is deprecated (See the freedesktop page and this thread on the freedesktop-ldtp-dev mailing list).\nThe best you can do to identify the control to use to automate the application is to rely on getobjectlist)('<window name>').\nExample (to set the Restack Horizontal point and the live preview):\n\n$ python\nPython 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) \n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from ldtp import *\n>>> launchapp('inkscape')\n11413\n>>> GTK Accessibility Module initialized\n\n>>> selectmenuitem('*Inkscape', 'Restack...')\n1\n>>> getobjectlist('Restack')\n['dlgRestack', 'flr8', 'flr9', 'flr4', 'flr5', 'lblHorizontalPoint', 'flr7', 'flr0',\n'flr1', 'flr2', 'flr3', 'lblVerticalPoint', 'mnuBottomtoTop(90)', 'mnuTop', 'spr1', \n'mnu8', 'flr11', 'mnu0', 'cboLefttoRight(0)', 'mnuRight', 'mnuRadialInward', \n'mnuMiddle1', 'mnu12', 'lblLivepreview', 'cboTop', 'flr6', 'mnuLefttoRight(0)', \n'btnApply', 'lblAngle', 'chk0', 'mnuRighttoLeft(180)', 'mnuRadialOutward', 'sbtn0', \n'mnuArbitraryAngle', 'lblRestackDirection', 'mnuLeft', 'btnClose', 'mnuMiddle', \n'mnuBottom', 'flr12', 'flr10', 'spr0', 'mnuToptoBottom(270)', 'cboMiddle']\n>>> click('dlgRestack', 'mnuMiddle1')\n1\n>>> click('dlgRestack', 'mnuMiddle')\n1\n>>> click('dlgRestack', 'chk0')\n1\n>>> click('dlgRestack', 'btnApply')\n1\n>>> click('dlgRestack', 'chk0')\n1\n>>> click('dlgRestack', 'btnApply') \n\n", "Q: Cannot install new version of Linux over Ubuntu I want to try new Linux distributions, and I can't get any to boot from USB or CD despite changing the boot order. \nIt doesn't even detect that it's there at all. \nIt works to boot onto on my desktop with Windows, but not my laptop with Ubuntu.\nDoes Ubuntu have some hidden setting or something?\nBecause the boot order already has the OS as the lowest one. \n\nA: Short answer is no Ubuntu does not have any hidden settings which will not allow you to run another OS. More than likely your system is using some type of EFI, or your live disk does not detect the correct settings (either EFI/legacy).\nYou could need to make a live disk which has an EFI loader. Normally (with newer distros) when making a live disk with distributions, you will have both an EFI settings with loader, and normal/legacy loader on the same disk. \nIf this is not the case (you can examine disk contents for EFI), you may need to check for a live version which is compatible with EFI. \nHowever if you are using BIOS, you may accidentally be loading the EFI settings, and would need to check to make sure you are loading the correct part of your disk.\n\nA: I just had the same problem.  \nThe way I resolved it was to create about 5 or 6 small partitions in fat16 and copy lots of text files to them.  Then I deleted them and created a couple of NTFS partitions where they were and did similar.\nFinally, I deleted those partitions, rebooted and installed my desired ubuntu partitions and installed ubuntu.  \nIt wasn't a different linux, but it was the same problem.  I couldn't use the desired partition routine because ubuntu wouldn't load.  \nThe drive developed the problem after installing Ubuntu 14.04 with LTS option.  \nIt's a pain, but it worked for me.\nI hope this helps\n", "Q: Green screen of death? on Ubuntu Workstation 14.10, \nI get a green screen (like the blue one of you know who).\nI've tried different screen because I thought the first one was dead, but using ubuntu, by a certain time, I've got all freezing on a beautiful green screen.\nDo someone ever seen that? What can be the cause? How to repair?\nAll has worked well during 3 months, and this green screen appeared a few days ago.\nI've run the command: lshw -c video\n*-display:0             \n   description: VGA compatible controller\n   product: 82Q963/Q965 Integrated Graphics Controller\n   vendor: Intel Corporation\n   physical id: 2\n   bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n   version: 02\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n   configuration: driver=i915 latency=0\n   resources: irq:43 memory:fea00000-feafffff memory:d0000000-dfffffff ioport:ecb8(size=8)\n*-display:1 UNCLAIMED\n   description: Display controller\n   product: 82Q963/Q965 Integrated Graphics Controller\n   vendor: Intel Corporation\n   physical id: 2.1\n   bus info: pci@0000:00:02.1\n   version: 02\n   width: 32 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: pm bus_master cap_list\n   configuration: latency=0\n   resources: memory:feb00000-febfffff`\n\n\nA: The \"green screen\" isn't Ubuntu specific.  My desktop's onboard graphics card died once, and it resulted in a green screen freezing everything.  It then subsequently hard crashed.\nIt sounds a lot like a dying graphics card.  The only thing you can really do is get a compatible graphics card for your system (or a replacement motherboard if it's an onboard integrated card) and see if the new graphics card being the only one running resolves the issues.\nNote if the machine is a laptop, you'll have to contact the manufacturer of the laptop for parts and service.\n", "Q: Experiencing small resolution issue in Ubuntu 14.04.2 with VirtualBox, getting stuck on installing guest additions TL;DR: I'm experiencing the small resolution issue in Ubuntu 14.04.2 on VirtualBox, and when I try to follow the answers to existing questions, either it doesn't solve the problem or I encounter certain obstacles that block me from completing the instructions (details below).\nBackground\nThe underlying problem is after installing Ubuntu 14.04.2 Desktop (32-bit) as guest VM in VirtualBox on a Windows 7 host, I'm having the small screen issue.\nWhat I've tried already\nI've already searched existing questions on this site regarding \"small resolution in VirtualBox,\" but none of the answers to existing questions have solved my problem in 14.04.2, which leads me to believe that this may not be a duplicate. Here are the questions to which the answers I've tried, with no luck.\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen Resolution Problem with Ubuntu 14.04 and VirtualBox\n\n*cannot change screen size from 640x480 after 14.04 installation on VirtualBox OSX\nSpecifics\nFailed Resolution Path #1:\nThe top answer for the first question says:\n\nYou basically need the Guest additions, log into the Virtual Machine to install the following packages:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms \\\nvirtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11\n\nFinally restart the VM to complete the installation.\n\nMy first attempt failed, apparently because of unmet package dependencies for virtualbox-guest-x11. Here's the link to the output on paste bin: http://pastebin.com/n0v1SLcW.\nBased on the message, I tried installing the xorg-video-abi-15 package and got a similar message about unmet dependencies - link to output on paste bin: http://pastebin.com/pxk2XpK5.\nAfter that, I gave up because there must be a better way than traversing the entire tree of unmet dependencies, am I right?\nFailed Resolution Path #2:\nThe second-highest answer says to go to System settings → Software and Updates → Additional drivers within the guest OS, choose \"Use x86 virtualization solutions...\", reboot VirtualBox, and after that it solved the problem for that particular user, but I tried these steps, and I still have the small resolution issue.\nFailed Resolution Paths #3 and #4:\nThe second question listed above says to just do sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms (and restart the guest) to resolve the problem, but this doesn't work for me, either. The second highest answer to the second question listed above says updating VirtualBox to the latest version, which at the time was 4.3.10 r93012, resolved the problem for that particular user, but I have an even later version (4.3.12 r93733), and when I do Help > Check for Updates, the updater pop-up says \"The network operation failed with the following error: Unknown reason.\"\nFailed Resolution Path #5:\nIn addition to the answers provided in the questions listed above, I've tried installing guest additions from the Devices menu in VirtualBox. The steps that I tried for this are log into the guest OS as super user, in the VirtualBox window go to Devices > Insert Guess Additions CD, click Run in the resulting pop-up, and authenticate as super user. After authenticating as super user, a terminal window opens up and does some things. After the processing is complete, this is what it says in Terminal: http://pastebin.com/72WH6aY4.\nPer the instructions in the Terminal output, I looked at /var/log/vboxadd-install.log to find out what went wrong, but that is a long, scary file with lots of information that I'm not sure what to do with (if anyone has any guidance on what specifically to look for in that file, I'd greatly appreciate it).\nSummary\nIn summary, I've tried five different possible resolution paths, including all the recommended answers to questions that I could find by searching this site, and none of them  have solved this problem for me in 14.04.2. Because of this, I suspect that there must be some different process for resolving this issue on Ubuntu 14.04.2. By the way, I was able to resolve the small screen issue on a 14.04.1 guest by simply installing the virtualbox-guest-dkms package, but for 14.04.2 I've hit a brick wall. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I was having similar problems with virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11 error messages. Then found this. I did the three steps, restarted and the screen is perfect.\nI did: sudo apt-get remove libcheese-gtk23 \nThen: sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core \nAnd finally: sudo apt-get install -f virtualbox-guest-x11. \nIt solved the problems for me.\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu 14.04.2 from disc we will also install the HWE stack by default (this is not the case on upgrading a pre-existent 14.04 installation). By this a newer version (1.16) of the xorg-server will be provided.\nVirtual Box supports this Xorg-Server only from version 4.3.16 and later. Earlier versions do not support the newer Xorg server. Apparently you had version 4.3.12 installed.\nTherefore rather than downgrading your Ubuntu installation it is recommended to upgrade Virtual Box on your host to a newer release (at present 4.3.22).\n\nA: Solution that worked for me:\nGo on this link http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/\nFind the exact version of your Virtualbox and download the VBoxGuestAdditions_version.iso\nThen plug it into the VM and allow it to run (it was automatic for me).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Just do this:\n1) open your terminal in ubuntu guest os\n2) type: sudo apt-get remove libcheese-gtk23\n3) then: sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core\n4) then: sudo apt-get install -f virtualbox-guest-x11\n5) after typing the 3rd command type y or i when asked and wait for it to finish\n6) Restart now and your problem should be solved.\n\nA: @Takkat is spot-on. The problem is the version of X Server on the GUEST in relation to what the HOST's version of Virtualbox will support in order to get full-screen.\nYou can get the version of X Server with X -version. Run this on the GUEST to see which version is installed. Of note, there is one - rather than two --. Also, this command outputs to stderr rather than stdout. This strikes me as odd, but perhaps someone can fill in the blanks as to why.\nPutting it all together, X -version |& grep 'X Server' will get you something like \"X.Org X Server 1.15.1\". Note that |& is necessary to pipe both stdout and stderr.\nYou can do another grep on that to isolate the version number if you are scripting something for validation.\nThis was sufficient for me to hardcode the supported version of X Server on the guest that my virtual machine setup script will work on. I assume that the host will run \"default\" Ubuntu with the older version of Virtualbox, so I just tell users to run 14.04.1 as the guest.\n\nA: Windows 7, VBox 4.3.12 r93733 (current version does not play nice with Avast)\nI spent hours trying to get this working full screen, these 3 steps worked, thank you!\nSystem settings menu item not working, so I had to\nsudo apt-get install unity-control-center\nall working now.  \n\nA: I ran into the same problem, and these steps fixed it: \n1) On the host, use the latest version of VirtualBox from virtualbox.org. (I used 4.3.26). \n2) On the guest (Ubuntu 14.04.2), run\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\n3) On the guest, do not use the Ubuntu repositories to install the guest additions.  \nInstead, press Host+D to use the guest additions ISO bundled with the newer version of VirtualBox that you downloaded to the host.\nYou shouldn't see any X11 package issues when installing the guest additions ISO.\nReboot and the screen size should be fixed.\n\nA: Experience has been same for me on windows7 host and ubuntu 12.04. \nThe solution that seems working for me is disabling the max resolution limitation in vbox, by typing \nVBoxManage setextradata global GUI/MaxGuestResolution any\n\nThe source is from a ticket at the virtualbox website.\n\nA: This problem is on Virtualbox 5.0.4\nThe command did not solve my problem\nOpen a New terminal > Install from the menu Devices > \"*..Guest Additions\" and then accept the installation in ubuntu, reboot and ready\n\nA: I run:\nsudo apt-get remove libcheese-gtk23\nthen:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core \nand finally:\nsudo apt-get install -f virtualbox-guest-x11\nIt solved problems for me.– conradk\nI found this in the website,it did work for me\n\nA: Just installed 14.04.5 and had same issues. Resolved by installing virtualbox-guest-x11-wily. Looks like this version of ubuntu has xorg stack from backported from wily (15.10) and corresponding guest driver installed fine and gave normal resolution.\n", "Q: Make more storage on VirtualBox ofr Ubuntu 14.10 I am trying to increase my storage space on my Ubuntu 14.10 virtual machine on Virtual Box.

Careful some may be important\nNote with VirtualBox you can set up shared folders that link to folders on the host machine - if you close the VM, and set up a shared folder, you can then mount it:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf \"name_of_shared_folder\" \"~/name_of_folder_on_guest/\"\n\nand use it.\nAnother (probably much simpler) way would be to resize the the virtual drive - you can do this by closing the VM and running:\n VBoxManage modifyhd “/PATH/TO/VIRTUAL_DRIVE.vdi” –resize SIZE_IN_MEGABYTES\n\nyou may need to run something like cd \"C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\" if you are using Windows as the host machine.

I'm constantly using cp on files only to find I've copied a useless hidden file on accident.\nI have been using locate -i filename | fgrep -v \".AppleDouble\" | fgrep -v \"._\" to remove those hidden files, but I'd like to change my bashrc in such a way that this is more or less default.\nWhat is the most effective way to exclude hidden files from what locate prints? With regex? Right now, I would write a script that passes an argument to locate and pipes to grep as shown, but if there's an easier way, please let me know.\n\nA: To exclude hidden files when using locate, try this:\nlocate -i --regex \"^/absolute/path/to/the/directory/[^\\.]+\"\n\nIf the directory contains files like .hidden, ..hidden, ...hiden they will be excluded too.

I want to use it in Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora.\n\n\n*\n\n*What filesystem do you recommend - ext4, xfs, btfrs, zfs...\ni. If it was ext4, I can reduce the reserved space safely (5%)? Until what percentage can I reduce it safely?\n\n*Which method is recommended to make the software RAID mdadm, (lvm) ... (I don't intend to do dynamic partitions)?\n\n*Have Ubuntu RAID auto-detected?\n\n*How can I get Ubuntu to send me an email, when some disk fails?\n\nA: suggestions:\n- use ext3 or ext4. I just go with defaults, sorry. \n\n\n*\n\n*I use mdadm. it works, is relatively easy to configure, and there's lots of support info out there found through google. There's a book or two also - O'Reilly - \"Managing RAID on Linux\" has useful info. \n\n*I haven't succeeded in getting Ubuntu to auto mount arrays, but I probably gave up too easily. I just mount the arrays when I boot. Also gives me a chance to e2fsck the arrays while they're not mounted. That's important, especially in RAID 5. Also chance to check array status. \n\nA: couple more pointers.  \n\n\n*\n\n*if you use mdadm to manage the raid array, when you install mdadm it asks questions to configure email settings for warning messages. So, you can set it up to send an email to specified address when problem occurs. I'll assume you can handle email server setup.\n\n*RAID 5 is problematic with large drives (anything over 1TB). RAID 5 was invented when drives were measured in dozens of megabytes. The problem is, the slightest hiccup throws the drive off the array, forcing it to run in degraded mode. People with large arrays (a lot of drives) increasingly find that the array can't be rebuilt, because the rebuild process examines every sector of every drive, and with large drives, the likelihood of being able to do that without encountering an error is not high - so, the rebuild fails. 4TB drives should be a real challenge. You might consider just going with RAID 0. Yes, you lose fault tolerance, but, you should be backing it up anyway, RAID 5 is NOT a substitute for backup! \n\n*That is why RAID 6 was invented - RAID 6 works like 5, except there are two spares instead of one. So, if you lose one drive, you don't go into degraded mode. Obviously this affects storage capacity accordingly. But, assuming you eventually need to rebuild the array, it takes even longer. \n\n*Assuming you still want to do RAID 5, buy good disk drives. Western Digital \"enterprise\" level drives are a reasonable choice. They're a little more expensive than every day ones, but they are better for RAID5. Shop carefully. No cheapies. \n\n*If you encounter an error, and the array goes into degraded mode, chances are that all the drives are fine. You just need to rebuild the array, which is re-constructed from the super block info on each one of the drives. The data is almost certainly going to be fine. It's just part of system management to keep an eye on the status of your arrays. \nI run a RAID 5 array using a bunch of 1TB drives in an external array. On my old system which was dated, and only had 1GB of memory (couldn't buy that type of memory any more) I had problems somewhat regularly. I replaced the system with a new one, bought 12GB of memory, moved the external array over and it works MUCH better.    \n", "Q: AllowTcp in ssh function I'm trying to set up a tor node following http://sickbits.net/creating-a-personal-privoxytorproxy-ec2-instance/ using ubuntu 14.4 lts on ec2.

Should I just add the line in or is this a mistake?\n\nA: You can add the line manually to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.\nIf the line were there before restarting, then it should be there after restarting too unless something has been done in the meantime or the restarting (stop-start) the service itself removes the line. In your case the the line should be there after restarting ssh.\nIf any invalid line is added to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, then ssh won't start after being stopped i.e. when you do sudo service ssh restart, ssh service will stop at first and then while starting it will read the configuration file and find an invalid line, then it would simply just stay stopped.

Whereas 3.16 is the kernel shipped with utopic.\nIf you ran do-release-upgrade lately, and you still use the old kernel be advised that all your old repositories ( where the old kernel headers reside) are disabled/cleaned from /etc/apt.\nUsually doing a release upgrade bumps the kernel minor by at least 2 versions ( from 3.13 to 3.16, and with vivi to 3.18).\nYou have 2 options at this point. Either go with the new kernel, and install the headers for that, and then rebuild missing drivers, or readd the repository list to apt from the old ubuntu distro, and install the missing headers.\n\nA: I had a similar problem - could not run virtualbox VMs, and my installed kernel version seemed OLDER than my installed kernel header files. (but with different precise version numbers than in the question.) (I got in this state after upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10 and then to 15.04)\nI discovered that in my GRUB menu on boot, under 'Additional options for Ubuntu', I can choose a newer kernel that matches my installed headers.\nChoosing that menu entry, then booting, allowed me to follow the virtualbox documented process to recompile virtualbox kernel modules and then start my virtualbox VMs.\nNext I tweaked my GRUB settings to make that kernel choice the default, as described here: http://statusq.org/archives/2012/10/24/4584/\n\nA: Try to use sudo apt --fix-broken install\n\nA: I WORK AROUND THIS ISSUE USING A PREVIOUS KERNEL!\nuser283885 is offering good solutions.\nI try other (previous) kernel. \nYou may try a newer or previous kernel (from the ones available in the apt-cache list 3.16*).\nHere is the test i made:\nMy actual kernel: 3.13.0-45-generic\nuname -a\nLinux pc-01 3.13.0-45-generic #74~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 15 20:21:55 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nReboot and select 3.13.0-44-generic (a previously installed kernel)\nThen i install linux-headers-3.13.0-44-generic, virtualbox-4.3 and DKMS\nAfter that i run the command to enable the driver\n/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\nAll works fine for me!\n(Thak you David Foerster.

I maintain a weekly updated backup of my whole hard disk with Kubuntu 14.04, thanks to Rsync. I rarely need to restore the back up, but today I did something nasty to my OS, too complex to try to fix it myself and I would like to restore the files of the back up blindly.\nThe problem is, I shrunk the main partition yesterday. If I restore everything, I am afraid I will overwrite some critical linux files containing information about the physical drive and the partition and it will make things worse.\nWhat are the files I should avoid overwriting with those in the backup? I guess it must be something within the /dev folder, but which ones exactly?\n\nA: To my knowledge, there are no files in Ubuntu which store or are dependent on the physical characteristics of the hard drive. All the information about the partitions is stored in the MBR and other data structures, which are outside of any filesystems (doing otherwise would create a chicken-and-egg problem, right? :)).\nThe only file which comes to mind is /etc/fstab, which contains UUID of partitions - if those UUIDs changed then obviously you should not override that file.\nAlso, /dev, /proc and /sys are virtual filesystems - they don't contain real files, rather they provide a view into kernel's internal data and configuration. You should not backup those directories and you definitely should not attempt to restore them from a backup.\nIf your system boots, I would also probably avoid touching /boot, just in case.\n", "Q: Any good information on HOW ENVIRONMENTS work in / on Ubuntu? I'm currently learning (really early stages) of Ubuntu.\nI've learned so far that Ubuntu can be run with other environments on it. Could you guys please provide info (links or descriptions) on HOW THIS WORKS and HOW many I can Run over Ubuntu? \n I know these are 3 questions in 1 but also, would the environments to be installed  have to be updated (or the same version) of the Ubuntu installed already?\nI've found links here on WHAT environment works and the beauty of using them but I can't seem to find the answer to my questions. \nP.S. I'm no looking for a long list of environments or a long explanation just a mild list or summary. \n\nA: You can install as many as you want to on a single version of ubuntu. You choose which one you want to use when you log in. Sometimes, installing kde (kubuntu) along with other environments can mess up your themes in other environments but other than that it's no problem. It's best to stick to one but you may want to have multiple ones to choose from until you decide which one you like best. \nIt also helps to have a barebones desktop like openbox or fluxbox to choose from when you need to run an application that uses alot of resources so you can get the best performance.\nYou can also dualboot (tripleboot etc)  more than one ubuntu on your computer.\n\nA: Here's a little more in-depth overview:\nUnix-like systems are traditionally build with console only, and historically they were so from the beginning until developers came up with graphical interface. Particularly , there must be a graphical server (think of it as a program/software ). So in the old days you'd go to console, log in, and run startx command to start that graphical server (in fact it's called the X server or X11, hence startx naming for the command ). Nowadays, there are other servers than X, particularly there's Wayland graphical server and X server derivatives. The first graphical environment would be motif , or mwm , which I use occasionally. Now, if you run startx you'd get simply the default environment that you have set for your user. If you'd want something else, you'd run startx /usr/bin/gnome-shell for instance. \nAs you can see this approach is somewhat cumbersome, so over the years developers came up with graphical login screens. In the Linux world they are commonly known as display managers or greeters. For instance, the default login screen for Ubuntu would be lightdm. This sofware decides which environment to give for a particular user. On that same login screen, you'd chose an alternative environment which are installed on your system. \nCan a user install multiple environments ? Yes. On my machine I have gnome,openbox,blackbox,icewm,mwm, and unity. Can two different environments be ran at the same time ? Yes. I occasionally run gnome-shell as logged in from the graphical login screen, and openbox on tty1 console with that same startx command mentioned above. An instance of x server works the same way as if you'd run multiple instances of any other software, and each instance shares control over screen and keyboard at a time - when one is active, the other just waits in the background for the user to give control over keyboard and screen to it.\nThere's tons of benefit for running multiple GUI environments, actually. If something breaks after an update, for instance Unity doesn't start , you can always hop into Gnome and continue working. \n", "Q: Apache2 read home folder directory when main domain is in /var/www I am setting a lab for students to create webpages this is the setup I currently have:\nI am a little new to setting up a web server, so please bear with me :-)\nOS - Ubuntu 14.04, Apache main domain in /var/www/<name of domain>, conf file in /etc/apache2/sites-available\nNow I have setup a user account with this structure /home/<username>/public_html\nI want to create an URL like this : http://<domain>/~<username>\nMy current virtual host is:\n <Virtualhost *:80>\n ServerName default.only\n <Location />\n Order allow,deny\n Deny from all\n </Location>\n Redirect permanent / https://bcs.net.nz/s/\n </Virtualhost>\n\n<IfModule mod_ssl.c>\n    <VirtualHost _default_:443>\n            ServerAdmin admin@bcs.net.nz\n            ServerName bcs.net.nz\n            ServerAlias www.bcs.net.nz\n\n            DocumentRoot /var/www/bcs.net.nz/s/\n\n\n            ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n            CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\n            SSLEngine On\n\n            SSLCertificateFile      /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt\n            SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key\n\n            <FilesMatch \"\\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$\">\n                            SSLOptions +StdEnvVars\n            </FilesMatch>\n            <Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin>\n                            SSLOptions +StdEnvVars\n            </Directory>\n\n            BrowserMatch \"MSIE [2-6]\" \\\n                            nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \\\n                            downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0\n\n    </VirtualHost>\n </IfModule>\n\n\n<VirtualHost 172.16.1.102:80 192.168.1.9:80>\nServerAdmin admin@bcs.net.nz\nServerName bcs.net.nz\nServerAlias www.bcs.net.nz\nDocumentRoot /var/www/bcs.net.nz/\n\n\n    <Directory /var/www/bcs.net.nz>\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteBase /\n\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK|OPTIONS|HEAD)\n    RewriteRule ^.* - [F]\n\n    </Directory>\n\n    ServerSignature off\n    AliasMatch ^/parallel/propulsion(.*) \"/var/www/bcs.net.nz/parallel/index.html\"\n    AliasMatch ^/parallel/(.*) \"/var/www/bcs.net.nz/parallel/index.html\"\n\n    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log\n\n    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,\n    # alert, emerg.\n    LogLevel warn\n\n    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined\n    ProxyBlock *\n </VirtualHost>\n\nI need to resolve the URL, but since the files are not in /var/www/ but the main domain is, I am a little stuck as to how to change the above virtual host file for this.\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: Run\nsudo a2enmod userdir\n\non the command line to enable the Apache module mod_userdir and make sure /home/<username>/public_html is accessible for the webserver.\n", "Q: blank screen on boot; can't reach login; 14.04 I've looked through almost all of the suggested questions as well as searched on the error messages in the attached logs and can't find anything applicable - at least as far as I understand things.\nI'm running 14.04 LTS upgraded from 12.04 LTS.

And if so is this some sort of bug, or is it somehow by design?\n\nA: You ran Nautilus from the root account (sudo) and you're trying to access the Trash.\nNormally, every user account has its own Trash, but root account doesn't have one. Because of elevated privileges, if you delete files while you're being root they'll be deleted immediately - no confirmations will be shown.\n(Keep in mind that you should be very careful doing something as root!)\n\nA: @user300458, you are mistaken my friend. The files you move to trash as sudo DO NOT get automatically deleted. It is a Nautilus bug as Paranoid Panda suspected. The trash can is not referenced properly here. \nAll files that were moved to trash can be found in: /root/.local/share/Trash/files - if you go there, you will find all the stuff you sent to trash intact and waiting for deletion. \nI'm going to see if I can find a way to fix the reference for the trash on google. \nIn the meantime, you can empty it by browsing to /root/.local/share/Trash/file and opening the terminal and putting in:\nrm -r *\n\nThere are also files in /root/.local/share/Trash/info. You can clean them out too if you care but those are small files.\n----------------------------------------------------------\n[EDIT]\n----------------------------------------------------------\nI didn't find much but I kind of lost interest when I saw a post from 2008 with the same problem.\nI just made a shell script: \nrm -r -f -d /root/.local/share/Trash/files/*\n\nrm -r -f -d /root/.local/share/Trash/info/* \n\nAnd I left it in: /root/.local/share/Trash\nWhich I bookmarked in Nautilus. So, if I want to see the content of trash, I click on the files subdirectory and if I want to empty trash, I run the script. \n\nA: sudo chown -hR user:user ~/.local./share/Trash\n\nYou can now empty trash from Nautilus as a normal user, but not sure if permanently fixed.\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo apt install trash-cli\n\nThen:\nsudo trash-empty\n\nSystem should find it.\n\nA: On my ubuntu 19.04, I deleted some files as root on nautilus which I coudn't remove from Trash in nautilus.

I am using Vagrant 1.7.2 , Ubuntu 13.04 , Virtual Box 4.3 12 r93733\nMy host machine is Windows 8.1\nHere is my node bootstrap script found on my bootstrap.sh\necho \"--- Installing Node.js ---\"\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.16.1/install.sh | bash\nsource ~/.nvm/nvm.sh\nnvm install 0.12\nnvm use 0.12\nsudo cp ~/.nvm/versions/nodejs/v0.12/bin/node /bin/node\n\necho \"--- Install node app dependencies --\"\ncd /var/www/html/node\nnpm install express\nnpm install youtube-audio-stream\n\nDuring provisioning I could see that node is installed correctly . I could see the Now using node v0.12 . I could also see that the npm install's are successful\nHowever when I connect using vagrant ssh . I get No command 'nvm' found . And The program 'node' can be found in the following packages: . I also checked ~/.nvm/ directory, it is not existing.\nIt becomes even weirder. So while I'm at ssh, I rerun the script again. Then nvm is now correctly installed and I could use node. \n\nA: Well, I found how to do it. And is very easy (way easier than I said).\nIn a nutshell, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Vagrantfile to run as normal user:\nconfig.vm.provision \"shell\", path: \"provision.sh\", privileged: false\n\n\n*Inside your provision file, do this:\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.24.1/install.sh | bash\nsource $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh\n\nThe command above will, first, install nvm from github creationix, and refresh the shell to enable the provision to use nvm commands to install node and npm.\n\n\n*Then, you just do this:\nnvm install stable\nnvm alias default stable\n\nThe 'stable' will always be the latest stable version of node. So if you want a particular version, just change the 'stable' to the version you need. \nThe second line, where you type nvm alias, is just telling to nvm that it needs to use as default the version you passed to it. Then nvm will know which version of node to call when nvm run the commands of node and npm. \nCredits to djheru for clarify things here https://stackoverflow.com/a/26691455\n\nA: Unless I'm mistaken, vagrant provisioning runs as root.  NVM's install is specific to the user, and it adds commands to the current user's bash config (in this case, root).  Without those commands, NPM is not available in the shell.  You have to install NVM and node as the vagrant user, not root.\nAlso, you're using an old version of NVM.\nsudo su vagrant -c 'curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.23.3/install.sh | bash'\nsudo su vagrant -c '. ~vagrant/.nvm/nvm.sh;nvm install v0.12'\nsudo su vagrant -c '. ~vagrant/.nvm/nvm.sh;nvm use v0.12'\n\n\nA: This is the way I solved this. I haven't tried your answers yet so I can't accept any but this is what worked for me.\ngit clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git /home/vagrant/.nvm && cd /home/vagrant/.nvm && git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`\nsource /home/vagrant/.nvm/nvm.sh\nnvm install 0.12\nnvm use 0.12\nn=$(which node);n=${n%/bin/node}; chmod -R 755 $n/bin/*; sudo cp -r $n/{bin,lib,share} /usr/local\n\n\nA: First of all I have to say that my answer is not a complete answer so read it carefully.\nYou need check out if your Vagrantfile is running provision as root. If so, you need to change to use like normal user:\nconfig.vm.provision \"shell\", path: \"provision.sh\", privileged: false\n\nThe privileged: false will do this change for you.\nNext, you will need to refresh the shell after the command to install nvm from github:\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.24.1/install.sh | bash\nsource $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh\n\nThe source $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh will do this for you. You can attach this command to your .bashrc file, in $HOME/.bashrc inside vagrant.\nThe sad thing is that you will need to export some environment variables of node and npm and put the command inside .bashrc too so when you enter via ssh in vagrant you will be able to use node and npm commands, but I don't know yet the right commands to do it, that's why I end up here hehehe...\nOh, and after add the commands to the .bashrc, you need to refresh the shell doing:\nsource $HOME/.bashrc\n\nWell, now I just need to find how to export the variables when installing node with nvm to complete this task hehe...\n", "Q: Ubuntu MATE: Where is Vino in dconf?

Is it possible for me to edit a few files in that partition, while backing up the partition, so that the backup is still up to date, i.e. the same as the partition at the time when the backup finishes? Thanks.\n\nA: Online backup of whole partitions is a terrible idea\nBacking up a partition can take a long time. Internet connection can break. If that happens when you are halfway through the online backup, you will be left with a huge file of garbage.\nA partition to be backed up, should be unmounted. If you mount the partition and fiddle with it, you will most likely end up with a huge file of garbage.\nThink about backing up your the files in your /home folder rather than backing up a whole partition. \nUse a backup software. There is a default one installed in Ubuntu. Set it up to backup often. Backup software are designed to do incremental backup. If you edit some files then the next time it backs up, it will only backup those files, and not everything else. You can backup every ten minutes, or every minute, or every hour.\nBackup to an external hard drive. Or another computer connected to your home network.\nIncremental backup alone doesn't solve the problem since if you modify the file or files during the backup, the backup can still grab a half modified file or set of files. This is particularly true if you are in the business of video editing. \nOf course, since it does take much less time than a full backup, it may be acceptable to make sure you aren't updating any files for the duration of the incremental backup.\nFor desktops: I recommend that you schedule full backup at late night or whenever you are likely to sleep. Keep your desktop on at night so that it can make backups without human interruptions. \nFor laptops: I recommend that you backup after you are done working for the day. You may also want to backup and charge your laptop at the same time.\n\nFor the ease of use I suggest the GUI Backup that comes pre-installed. If you want a command line solution, you don't have to look farther than rsync and cron (or anacron).\nrsync is a very powerful command line tool you can use in a script with many options. One of those options backs up (copies) only files that have changed. You will need two scripts, one for full backup and one for incremental one. Both will use rsync with different options. \ncron and anacron are powerful tools to automate the backup script, so that it gets executed at fixed interval.\nUbuntu's official documentation on the topic of backup is pretty good.\nHope this helps\n\nA: \ni.e. the same as the partition at the time when the backup finishes?\n\nNo, you can't get a consistent backup that is fully up to date at the end, but you can get a consistent backup that represents the state of the disk at the start by using an LVM snapshot.  You create a snapshot with lvcreate -s, and that gets you a new device whose contents appear to be the state of the original volume at the time you created the snapshot, while you continue to modify the original volume.  Then you can backup the snapshot without worrying that the backup will contain a mix of data from before and during the backup.  When you're done with the backup, you delete the snapshot.\nThis of course, requires that you installed the system originally using lvm and have some free space in your physical volume(s) to create the snapshot.\n", "Q: How shall I partition my hard drive for Ubuntu (with Windows in virtualbox) I dual boot installed Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 on a hard drive before. I remember Windows has to be installed on a primary partition which has to be at least of certain size.\nNow I get a new hard drive of 1TB. I would like to install Ubuntu 14.04 or a later version on it, and then some time later (not now) install virtualbox and Windows under virtualbox (although I haven't completely ruled out installing Windows 8.1 as dual boot yet, but if that happens, shouldn't I install Windows before Ubuntu?). \nCould you suggest me how to design the partitions of my hard drive, such as \n\n\n*\n\n*what must be put on primary partitions?\n\n*how many partitions for what purposes, at least how much size, and logic or primary?\n\n*where should I leave unpartitioned free space, so that later when one of the partitions runs out of place, it is possible/easier to add more free space to the partition?\n\n*what else do I need to know?\nThanks.\n\nA: Sometimes I look at this notice from time to time when installing Ubuntu on different PC devices, just to be sure in case I forgot something. :) I think this is plenty enough about partitioning.\n\nA: For that kind of setup, you don't need to do anything special.  It's essentially just a normal desktop installation of Ubuntu, so at minimum all you need is one big partition, plus some swap space (usually in another partition).\nUnless you have any specific requirement that would require something else, I'd recommend just going with the default partitioning that the Ubuntu installer suggests.\nI acknowledge the suggestion from others about separate root (/) and /home partitions, and that this is totally about personal preference, but having one big partition doesn't prevent you preserving your home directories when reinstalling, it just makes it slightly less convenient depending on how you're going to do it.  If you're not literally going to be re-installing the system all the time, I'd downplay the need for it.  This may be going against traditional Linux wisdom, but having one big partition for all files follows current Ubuntu thinking - they haven't made this the default in their installer by accident or neglect but because they specifically chose it as a suitable default for most people.\nAs for your Virtualbox installation, that's gonna put large \"virtual hard drive\" files somewhere in your home directory.  Unless your hard drive is pretty small, this probably isn't going to significantly impact your partitioning strategy even if you do opt for separated partitions.\nNote: I have run Virtualbox inside Ubuntu before and found it frustrating, and I don't do it anymore.  If I need Windows I boot into it.  But if your only need for it is the occasional software testing, then I guess that makes sense.\n\nA: This is where things start to become a matter of personal preference and recommendation.  Unless you have special purpose for a dual boot system, I found switching back and forth tedious.  But that is a matter of style and organisation.  I use Virtualbox for those Windows only applications that don't cut Wine and avoid the reboot interruption.\nThe Linux system should have at least 3 partitions, /(root), /home, and swap (10-30GB, the bulk, RAM size equivalent, repectively) .  This allows one to completely screw-up a system and not loose personal data.  It allows pithing the old root and grafting on a new. It allows switching distributions without too much drama.\nA step in any direction precludes diverging options, but partitioning a drive, while having constraints, is not a permanent decision.  \nWith a 1TB drive you could always allot 40,60-100GB to the first partition , for storage, and later,(as I've heard Windows is persnickety about placement, IDK, the last I used was XP).  If you want a dual-boot Windows partition, it's just a matter of moving the boxes out of the garage and putting in carpeting.  Resizing generally is only a matter of time.\n...but, like I said, it's personal preference.   \nEdit: As neon_overload suggested, if you're not going to be under the hood tinkering, one partition (two, with swap), be done with it.  But if you like to bang on the pipes and rearrange furniture - compartmentalise.\n", "Q: sudo apt-get install php5-imagick gives \"404 Not Found\" error and \"E: Failed to fetch ...\" Running:\nsudo apt-get install php5-imagick \n\nfailed, and produced output including this in the middle:\nGet:7 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main libavahi-common3 amd64 0.6.31-4ubuntu1 [21.7 kB]\nGet:8 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main libavahi-client3 amd64 0.6.31-4ubuntu1 [25.1 kB]\nErr http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates/main libcups2 amd64 1.7.2-0ubuntu1.1\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.23 80]\nGet:9 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates/main libcupsfilters1 amd64 1.0.52-0ubuntu1.2 [74.4 kB]\nGet:10 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main libfftw3-double3 amd64 3.3.3-7ubuntu3 [702 kB]\nErr http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-security/main libcups2 amd64 1.7.2-0ubuntu1.1\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nErr http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-security/main libcupsimage2 amd64 1.7.2-0ubuntu1.1\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nGet:11 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main libjasper1 amd64 1.900.1-14ubuntu3 [129 kB]\nGet:12 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main liblcms2-2 amd64 2.5-0ubuntu4 [132 kB]\n\nand this at the end (referring to the same errors):\nE: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/cups/libcups2_1.7.2-0ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nE: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/cups/libcupsimage2_1.7.2-0ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.200 80]\nE: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?\n\n\nA: Other questions were near duplicates but had different error messages and very complicated solutions, so it seemed sensible to post this question and answer to try to keep things simple.\nIn my case, it was resolved by simply running:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nHopefully others will find it's as simple as this too :-)\n", "Q: GPG says that it needs a passphrase but it actually doesn't I try to use GPG to sign files but something confuses me: If I enter \n    in the terminal (the file I want to sign is called \"checksums\") it says:\n$ gpg -s checksums\nYou need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for\nuser: \"[my name] <[my email prefix]@gmail.com>\"\n4096-bit RSA key, ID C457C71D, created 2015-01-16\n\nHowever, it doesn't ask me to enter my password but just does the signing process.

Whether and how long the cache works can be configured.\ngpg-agent\ngpg checks if there is a running gpg-agent (or, in newer versions, necessarily starts one). gpg-agent does (among other things) cache your pass phrase for a given time.\nConfiguration\nThis time span can be configured in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf, which in my case contains a line\ndefault-cache-ttl 600\n\nto set the cache time to ten minutes (10*60 seconds).

First I was using the normal version preinstalled with Ubuntu, then I installed VI Improved from Ubuntu Software Center, with some plugins for working with Python.\nEverything was fine until I installed GVim again from Ubuntu Software Center. I liked that version because it has a menu bar, I can launch GVim from the Unity dock, etc. Then I uninstall VI Improved from Ubuntu Software Center because I thought it didn't has sense to have it installed, I also move usr/share/vim folder to my home folder because I thought that was the folder containing GVim files (the one I wanted to use) and almost every plugins are installed in that path.\nI really really screwed up, I installed and reinstalled, erased and restored files and Vim packages looking for the solution, now when I open GVim, it doesn't show the menu bar, the highlighting doesn't work too, I try to run :Explore command and it gives me E492 error (It is not an editor order: Explore), also the autocomplete is not working.\nWhat do you guys recommend me?

I had an install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a different machine, with Nvidia drivers manually installed. I \"accepted\" an automatic update and it hosed my computer, I still haven't been able to get it back working.\nBut no worries, I installed 14.04 on a different machine and it's (currently) working fine. But 48 hours after the install I get an auto update notice. How worried should I be? The first laptop was a 2010 build, the latest one is a 2013 build. If that matters.\n\nA: You shouldn't be that worried if you have not installed the nvidia driver on the newer computer in the same way that you did on the first one. There are a few things you should be aware of.\nFirst: \nthe nvidia drivers will use dkms if it is installed when you manually install the driver. Before installing the nvidia driver, run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install dkms\n\nThen, you may install or reinstall the nvidia driver and should not have any issues updating to new kernels and will not have to reinstall the drivers after updating kernels.\nNext:\nyou should be able to log in from grub using the old kernel. Select \"Advanced Options\" and then select the older kernel from the next menu. This will give you a way to use the machine until you install dkms and reinstall the driver (on the older computer).\nFinally:\nYou can manually apply updates on any machine using the command-line and doing so will offer two options. Run the following commands in an open terminal.\nOption one:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nUsing the above option is safe and should not perform any updates that will break the system. This way, you can perform security updates and other bug fixes without disrupting the system. This is for when you are working on a project or using the machine for production and need to maintain function.\nOption two:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThis option will perform all updates including kernel upgrades and other updates that  make changes to the system and could affect the overall function. Use this when you are not in the middle of a project and have some time to fix any problems that may arise. Problems are not likely but are possible as you have found out. Also, problems are not typical. Installing dkms before manually installing nvidia should prevent future issues.\n", "Q: How do I redirect the output of grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2?

The creators of some packages provide both Upstart and sysvinit service files, since the packages maybe used in a system without Upstart (such as an older version of Debian). This way, the package creator doesn't have to provide two packages for both init systems. If the Upstart service is running, the sysvinit service shouldn't be, which is why that check is in place.\n", "Q: On every single kernel update, I need to reinstall the NVidia driver and Unity is broken Every time I do a kernel update (with the regular standard update manager in Ubuntu 14.10), Unity breaks completely.\nI need to reinstall the Nvidia drivers and I need to manually repair Unity.  If I don't repair Unity, users just see an empty desktop - there's lot's of posts about that.\nIt was a bit better when I was using Lubuntu (which I installed for that reason), on Lubuntu I just needed to reinstall the NVidia drivers.\nThis is so annoying it will push me off Ubuntu completely.  I've never liked Unity that much (although on my other machines, it's now workable) , but it is just so unstable .  How is it acceptable that repairing Unity is a regular task on a desktop (also see all the other posts on the subject) ?\nThe other problem is obviously with the Nvidia drivers ... never again I'll get a machine with Nvidia graphic cards ...\nBut anyway, does anybody have hints/tips how I can work with this ?  The big issue is that sometimes, other people need to use the PC and then it's unusable, so I have to fix it, which is a bit difficult for me most of the time since I'm rarely at home.\n\nA: After digging around a bit for you... I found that version 340.65 the latest update via the Ubuntu repo claims to have fixed all of these bugs... Wouldn't hurt to give it a shot... \nHow to install latest nvidia drivers Ubuntu ppa\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.10 is not LTS and many packages come from Debians non-stable branch. I recommend going back to 14.04 LTS for stable upgrades\nIf you want to stick with 14.10 I suggest the following before each upgrade...\nTry removing all previous nvidia drivers first sudo apt-get -purge nvidia\nRemove current nvidia driver sudo apt-get remove nvidia-340 \nAfter upgrading then re-install the nvidia driver.\n\nA: I had this problem for years! I was manually reinstalling nvidia drivers after each upgrade. Finally I discovered the problem can stem from dkms, which is supposed to rebuild modules upon installation of a new kernel.\nTry: dkms status\nFor me, this threw an error message, which helped me realize the source of the problem:\nError! Could not locate dkms.conf file.\nFile: /var/lib/dkms/anbox-modules-ashmem/8~zesty1/source/dkms.conf does not exist.\n\nIn my case, I had some leftover files in /var/lib/dkms/ that should have been removed when I uninstalled Anbox. So I manually removed those (sudo rm -rf /var/lib/dkms/anbox-modules-ashmem) and afterward dkms status worked, and kernel upgrades automatically compiled new nvidia drivers.\nYou may similarly have some bad files in /var/lib/dkms/ (either from Anbox or some other program) that prevent dkms from working normally.\n", "Q: Switch tasks on active process to new process What I'm going to explain is really about nginx processes, so maybe it can be done in nginx, or maybe its a Linux feature. In anyway, I hope it's possible.\nI have an ningx process running, that looks like this:\nroot     19568  .....  nginx: master (old)\napp      20769  .....  nginx: worker (old)\n\nI then send a USR2 signal to the master process: kill -USR2 19568\nThat gives me a new master and worker process:\nroot     19568  .....  nginx: master (old)\napp      20769  .....  nginx: worker (old)\nroot     22716  .....  nginx: master (new)\napp      22717  .....  nginx: worker (new)\n\nSo currently, the old processes are handeling all the data. Can I tell nginx or Ubuntu to swap those tasks to the new procceses?\n\nWhy do I need this?\nI know nginx has a reload command to dynamically reload its config. It can even update its own executable without any downtime.\nBut my nginx server uses a TCP module, so it is receiving data constantly. Because of that I cannot uses a reload or HUP command, because the worker processes are constantly busy. They cannot shut down.\nRestarting nginx makes me loose all the client connections, and I really don't want that.\nThat's why I'm looking for a way to move the tasks that a certain process has to a new instance of that process.\n\nA: Nginx depends on worker processes being able to shutdown gracefully. Apparently it can start new requests with the newly applied configuration. But it does not continue already started requests.\nTo quote from http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html:\n\nOnce the master process receives the signal to reload configuration, it checks the syntax validity of the new configuration file and tries to apply the configuration provided in it. If this is a success, the master process starts new worker processes and sends messages to old worker processes, requesting them to shut down. Otherwise, the master process rolls back the changes and continues to work with the old configuration. Old worker processes, receiving a command to shut down, stop accepting new connections and continue to service current requests until all such requests are serviced. After that, the old worker processes exit.\n\nThough there apparently is a way to transfer sockets to another process in Linux - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1997622/can-i-open-a-socket-and-pass-it-to-another-process-in-linux - it is still unlikely nginx would just 'pick up on that' and just start applying its given (new) configuration.\nIf the underlieing goal of this question is to apply changes to a running service without losing client connections in the future, you will probably have to ask another question.\nThat question may be about implementing some pause logic. Like saving state when asked to shutdown gracefully and restoring state (e.g. state associated with a certain session or request).\n", "Q: ldap client ubuntu 14.04 Hello Ubuntu Community :D\nI have a problem with ubuntu 14.04 and ldap :(\nhere are my configuration file:\n\n/etc/ldap.conf:\nbase dc=ad,dc=school,dc=fr\nuri ldap://dcad1.ad.school.fr\nldap_version 3\nbinddn CN=app,OU=admin,DC=ad,DC=school,DC=fr\nbindpw mypassword\n\nnss_map_objectclass posixAccount user\nnss_map_objectclass shadowAccount user\nnss_map_attribute uid sAMAccountName\nnss_map_attribute homeDirectory unixHomeDirectory\nnss_map_attribute shadowLastChange pwdLastSet\nnss_map_objectclass posixGroup group\nnss_map_attribute uniqueMember member\npam_login_attribute sAMAccountName\npam_filter objectclass=User\nnss_base_passwd ou=people,dc=ad,dc=school,dc=fr?sub\nnss_base_group ou=etp,ou=uds,ou=groups,dc=ad,dc=school,dc=fr?sub\n\n\n/etc/nsswitch.conf: \npasswd:         files ldap\ngroup:          files ldap\nshadow:         files ldap\n\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\nnetworks:       files\n\nprotocols:      db files\nservices:       db files\nethers:         db files\nrpc:            db files\n\nnetgroup:       nis\n\n\n/etc/krb5.conf:\n[libdefaults]\n       default_realm = AD.SCHOOL.FR\n       dns_lookup_realm = true\n       dns_lookup_kdc = true\n\n[domain_realm]\n      .u-SCHOOL.fr = AD.SCHOOL.FR\n      u-SCHOOL.fr = AD.SCHOOL.FR\n      .SCHOOL.fr = AD.SCHOOL.FR\n      SCHOOL.fr = AD.SCHOOL.FR\n      .app.ad.SCHOOL.fr = AD.SCHOOL.FR\n      app.ad.SCHOOL.fr = AD.SCHOOL.FR\n\n[logging]\n   kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log\n   admin_server = FILE:/var/log/krbadmin.log\n   default = FILE:/var/log/krb5lib.log\n\n\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nKerberosAuthentication yes\nKerberosOrLocalPasswd yes\n\n\n/etc/pam.d/common-account :\naccount sufficient      pam_krb5.so ignore_root realm=AD.SCHOOL.FR\naccount required        pam_unix.so\n\n\nPour /etc/pam.d/common-auth :\nauth    sufficient      pam_krb5.so ignore_root realm=AD.SCHOOL.FR\nauth    required        pam_unix.so nullok_secure try_first_pass\n\n\n/etc/pam.d/common-password :\npassword        required        pam_unix.so nullok obscure sha512\n\n\n/etc/pam.d/common-session :\nsession sufficient      pam_krb5.so ignore_root realm=AD.UNISTRA.FR\nsession required        pam_unix.so\n\n\nThis configuration work fine with Ubuntu 10.04 but ubuntu 14.04 i have a probleme:\nthe session opens and closes immediately.

This allows file names that contain\n  newlines or other types of white space to be correctly interpreted by programs that process\n  the find output. This option corresponds to the -0 option of xargs.\n\nWhich is a bit more efficient, because it amounts to:\nrm file1 file2 file3 ...\n\nas opposed to:\nrm file1; rm file2; rm file3; ...\n\nas in the -exec method.\n\nAn alternative and also faster command is using exec's + terminator instead of \\;:\nfind /path/to/ -type f -mtime +7 -name '*.gz' -execdir rm -- '{}' +\n\nThis command will run rm only once at the end instead of each time a file is found and this command is almost as fast as using -delete option as following in modern find:\nfind /path/to/ -type f -mtime +7 -name '*.gz' -delete\n\n\nA: Be careful removing files with find. Run the command with -ls to check what you are removing\nfind /media/bkfolder/ -mtime +7 -name '*.gz' -ls\n . Then pull up the command from history and append -exec rm {} \\;\nLimit the damage a find command can do. If you want to remove files from just one directory, -maxdepth 1 prevents find from walking through subdirectories or from searching the full system if you typo /media/bkfolder /. \nOther limits I add are more specific name arguments like -name 'wncw*.gz', adding a newer-than time  -mtime -31, and quoting the directories searched. These are particularly important if you are automating cleanups.\nfind \"/media/bkfolder/\" -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +7 -mtime -31 -name 'wncw*.gz' -ls -exec rm {} \\;\n\nA: for the completeness: you may also use -delete\nfind /some/where/ -name '*.log' -type f -mtime +7 -delete\n\nthis way you don't run a command per file.\n", "Q: What is the difference in running script with ./ What is the difference between running the script by calling directly its name and\ncalling the script by adding a with prefix of './' .\nI can't find any difference in run time.\n\nA: If the scripts directory isn't in your PATH, and .

Is there anything else I could do about it?\n\nA: Solved! Finally, googling around for ideas and hints I figured it out how to optimize volume levels settings manually (e.g. pcm) I had to edit alsa-mixer configuration file for analog output:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common\n\nthere be:\n[Element PCM]\nswitch = mute\nvolume = merge\noverride-map.1 = all\noverride-map.2 = all-left,all-right\n\nand one has to change to:\n[Element PCM]\nswitch = mute\nvolume = ignore\noverride-map.1 = all\noverride-map.2 = all-left,all-right\n\nalso after volume = ignore you can manually set your prefered volume value for your ear adding a line e.g.:\nvolume-limit = 0.07\n\nthen in terminal run:\npulseaudio -k\n\nDone. The volume will be up to 100% but the pcm level will be left with your prefered value.\nAlso I received an email (reply) from Launchpad that describes a similar bug and advice to fix it:\nsudo gedit /etc/pulse/daemon.conf\n\nand change:\nflat-volumes = yes\n\nto\nflat-volumes = no\n\nThough it mostly relates to Ubuntu 14.10 and later.\n", "Q: How to install Netbeans 8.0.2 on ubuntu 14.x I have netbeans downloaded from the netbeans.org site.\nThis is the file name → netbeans-8.0.2-linux.sh\nI dont know how to install it on ubuntu 14.10 \nIs there any one can help me install netbeans on ubuntu?\n\nA: Open the Terminal and considering the file is in Downloads directory then do \n\nchmod +x ~/Downloads/netbeans-8.0.2-linux.sh\n\nAfter that\n\ncd ~/Downloads && ./netbeans-8.0.2-linux.sh\n\nAnd that will bring up the Installation Window.\nTo Uninstall run \n\n./uninstall.sh\n\nin the install directory\n\nA: Here is how I handled it, after reading this thread;\nI tried first to check the file permissions, through the graphical interface, by opening\n\n'home', 'download', \n\ni.e. the location where I put netbeans-8.0.2-linux.sh;\nseeing the button for changing the file to executable was unchecked, I checked it;\nI opened a terminal, changed to the directory where netbeans was, and typed:\n\n'netbeans-8.0.2-linux.sh'\n\nonly to be greeted by a 'command not found'...\nso I went over the web to check the reason...\nand found this thread;\nby reading it, I have a better idea of what is going on;\nso, I tried, as a last resort, to issue the command like that:\n\nsudo bash netbeans-8.0.2-linux.sh\n\n...and it went on, smoothly, installing everything.\nI just want to add that it didn't really need my password, strange enough;\nbut it looks it needed to be prefixed with 'bash', otherwise it didn't recognize it, even if the permissions were all there, I checked with \n'ls -l', and it was executable for all :user, groups, and others...\nI wonder if I have something out of order, or simply configured in some special way, in my config files, maybe in the proc directory...\nbut now I have another problem:\nI started a C project, just to try how netbeans worked, and it did open, create really, a project skeleton;\nbut it does not find the standard library headers, 'stdio.h' and s'tdlib.h'...\nBecause, now, this is a separate issue, I will not expand it here; I should start another thread on it.\nAnyway, thank so much for the help found in this page :)\nI am new to linux, and trying to learn it.\nAny clarification would be very welcome.\nUbuntu 14.10 amd turion x2 64 advent 9515 2GB ram\n", "Q: I have at least 4 python interpreters on my PC, now what?

See /usr/share/doc/python3.3-minimal/README.Debian for a list of the modules contained in this package.\nYet as Florian Diesch explains Python 3.3.2+ is unofficial and not a necessity unless you have programs dependent on that listed by /usr/share/doc/python3.3-minimal/README.Debian\n", "Q: Fixing links on sidebar of file explorer after changing username I changed my username and home directory as described in this ask-ubuntu-link.

I'm programming a Fuse file-system. \nSo far so normal, didn't encounter unsolvable problems (except performance). \nHowever, I read the following articles:\nhttp://linuxcommand.org/lts0070.php\nhttp://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml\nhttp://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/UNIXpermiss.htm\nhttp://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/309527-understanding-linux-file-permissions\nhttp://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-permission.htm\nhttps://kb.iu.edu/d/abdb\nAnd I've got the following question: \nGiven a generic unix-permission-string - \nI understand the string (after the first char) is partitioned into \ngroups of 3 (rwx) for\nowner\nowner_group\nall/world/anyone\n\nHowever, one of the articles explicitly states, 1 user can be in N groups. \nSo why the singular here for owner group (not groups) ? \nWhat exactly is the owner group, if I (the file creator and therefore owner) am in several groups ? \nSay I'm member of group A, group B, and group C. \nNow I create a file somewhere.\nSince the expression owner_group is singular and not plural, \nto which group get's the owner_group permissions applied ? \nA XOR B XOR C, or all of them, or none of them ? \nIf it gets applied to only one (as the singular implies), how is determined which group the rights are assigned to ? \nI have the distinct feeling I don't really understand something here, or that I misunderstand the meaning of the term \"owner group\".\n\nA: *\n\n*A user may be a member of multiple groups. \n\n*A file is be owned by exactly one group and one user.\n\n*If the user is a member of the file's owner group (i.e., group foo owns the file and one of the user's groups is foo), then the respective group permissions apply to that user (unless overridden by the owner permissions).\n\n\nThe owner group is part of the file's ownership. Consider:\n$ stat /usr/bin/crontab \n  File: ‘/usr/bin/crontab’\n  Size: 35984       Blocks: 72         IO Block: 4096   regular file\nDevice: 803h/2051d  Inode: 131439      Links: 1\nAccess: (2755/-rwxr-sr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (  103/ crontab)\nAccess: 2015-02-05 20:20:43.438507538 +0530\nModify: 2013-02-09 12:32:23.000000000 +0530\nChange: 2014-09-30 19:22:09.508515013 +0530\n Birth: -\n\nThis states that the file's ownership is with user root and group crontab.\n\nSay I'm member of group A, group B, and group C. \n  Now I create a file somewhere. ... [To] which group get's the owner_group permissions applied ? \n\nThat depends on what your primary group is at the time you created that file. The primary group is the first one listed when you run the groups command. Usually, this is determined by your GID. However, you can temporarily set one of your other groups as primary using the newgrp command. For example:\n$ groups \nmuru adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare\n$ rm foo; touch foo\n$ stat -c %G foo  # this prints the owner group of the file\nmuru\n$ newgrp sudo   \n$ rm foo; touch foo\n$ stat -c %G foo\nsudo\n\n\nI have the distinct feeling I don't really understand something here, or that I misunderstand the meaning of the term \"owner group\".\n\nThat the owner group is an attribute of the file, not the user.\n\nI understand the string (after the first char) is partitioned into groups of 3 (rwx) for\nowner\nowner_group\nall/world/anyone\n\n\nSlightly off: the third field is others, not all. Others covers everyone except the owner of the file and members of the owner group of the file. The distinction comes into play when using symbolic modes with chmod:\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod a-x takes away everyone's execute permissions\n\n*chmod o-x takes away everyone else's execute permission, while leaving the owner and owner group's execute permission untouched.\n\n\nLastly, a note on user private groups. UPGs are fairly common on desktop systems, but do not take them for granted elsewhere. If UPGs are enabled, it is likely that the user's primary group and username have the same numeric id and name, and there is a unique group for each user. That is all.\n", "Q: cannot execute filename.o file in cygwin with gcc I have a build shell script that reads as follows,\n#!/bin/sh\n\ngcc -o posture.exe main.c posture_algorithm.c\n\nThen I run the following command to set permission,\nchmod 755 posture_algo.o\n\nfollowed by,\n./posture_algorithm.o\n\nI get the following error,\n-bash: ./posture_algo.o: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error\n\n\nA: posture_algo.o is a file containing object code.

After installation I also installed VirtualBox guest additions.\nI went to Ubuntu, mounted the (F:) partition and added my_VM_name.vbox in VirtualBox.

The path changes when you change OS (from F:/something to /media/user/hexadecimal_number/something) and the information on the .vbox file becomes invalid.\nAFAIK you can't just share the same VMs seamless between both OSes. But you can create a new, identical Virtual Machine in Linux that uses the same Virtual Hard Disk and Virtual Hardware than the Windows one (but a different vbox file).

You'll probably want to install clamav-daemon as well.  The first time clamd runs, it'll create /etc/clamav/clamd.conf.\nNote that the clamav package does install clamscan, which you can invoke manually to scan specific files/directories.  However, by default, nothing will be scanned automatically. clamav-daemon allows scans to be triggered remotely, but even that doesn't schedule scans or provide realtime protection.\nThis is a good reminder that you should never just install security software and forget about it.  You need to make sure it's working properly.  I'm sure plenty of people run sudo apt-get install clamav, then just assume it's working in the background--when, in reality, all that's running is freshclam.\nIf you're actually looking for realtime protection, instead of just trying to run a scan, user61995 mentioned a potential solution.  I haven't tested it.\ntl;dr: sudo apt install clamav-daemon to fix the error, but you still have to run scans manually to be protected; these packages don't provide realtime protection.\n\nA: On-access scanning exists if you are looking for that.

I have an extra 500GB HDD sitting around that I was going to use for Ubuntu as dual boot but I don't necessarily want to boot from disk--I've gotten used to my 10 second start ups.  Would it make sense to partition a small amount of my SSD (~15GB) for Ubuntu system files and some programs and then have the extra HDD for additional storage?\nI hope this makes sense but, if no, feel free to comment on my question?.\n\nA: You could partition your SSD and install the OS there.

On the desktop editions \"acl\" is installed by default. \nNow the problem is that because you messed up \"sudo\" and probably did not create a collection of permissions you will need an outside source.  If you have another system you can make these files yourself with the command below. If you do not have a 2nd machine I created a permissions file of all the files in /usr/ (/etc/ and /var/ are included below too) with\ngetfacl -R / > /tmp/permissions_usr.acl\n\nand uploaded it to dropbox (12Mb).

I'm running Firefox and Chrome (and may use others), whilst Firefox seems to be set as the default browser, Chrome says it 'cannot determine or set the default browser' and had no method of setting the default as Chrome.\n\nA: Click Start bar -> Preferences -> LXQT Settings -> LXQT Configuration Center -> Sessions Settings and then in 'web-browser' click 'search'.\nThe default folder should be /usr/bin.\nScroll and find 'google-chrome'\nIf it's not there, download google chrome from here and install it with 'Discover'.\nThen redo the steps above.\nOnce set, re-login, or restart.\n\nA: run the following in a terminal:\nsudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser\n\nIt will present you a list of available browsers that are installed, and lets you select your default one.\n\nA: In Lubuntu there is an application in the menu called default applications for lxsession.  It is under Preferences.  Once you open it, merely navigate to web browser and choose the browser that you would like to be the default choice.  Alternatively, there is a choice in Firefox and there probably is one in chrome as well where you choose it to be the default browser.  In Firefox go to Edit->Preferences->General.\n\nA: Go to preferences -> configure alternatives, in list groups, choose gnome-www-browser and set it to google-chrome-stable with the lowest priority.\nTo test how it works, type gnome-www-browser in the console and chrome should pop off.\n\nA: Run below command to update default settings:\nsudo xdg-settings set default-web-browser google-chrome.desktop\nsudo xdg-mime default google-chrome.desktop x-scheme-handler/http\nsudo xdg-mime default google-chrome.desktop x-scheme-handler/https\nsudo xdg-mime default google-chrome.desktop text/html\n\n\nA: Setting the default browser depends on the application you wish to launch your browser from, because Linux has several methods of determining default applications, so applications use different methods.\nFor example, the Lubuntu/LXDE default terminal, LXTerminal, uses xdg-open to launch a browser when a URL is clicked. Setting your default browser via update-alternatives will in that case have no effect.\nAs you mentioned Thunderbird in some of your comments, things seem to be even more complicated when it comes to Thunderbird. (Refer to Bug 724461 as well as this blog post about how Thunderbird chooses a browser.)\nIn short, if you tried other methods and things still don't work out, you could run the following commands to update xdg-open's default application for Web URLs to Chrome:\nsudo xdg-mime default chromium-browser.desktop x-scheme-handler/http\nsudo xdg-mime default chromium-browser.desktop x-scheme-handler/https\n\nThis approach works for LXTerminal on Lubuntu 14.10 and should also work for Thunderbird. \n", "Q: How to copy and paste all text recovered in Terminal with `strings` command?

To get what you want you just need to save the output of strings to another file and then read the new file in the usual manner. Here is the way:\nstrings foo.doc > bar.doc\n\nNow bar.doc will contain the strings having printable characters from foo.doc.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu/Win8.1 dual boot with UEFI and 4 primary partitions I want to install Ubuntu in dual boot with windows 8.1 in my Acer V3-572G-75CA.

They describe what commands need to be run, and how to wrap them into a systemd service. However, the service will run whether or not the modem is actually present, which may be undesirable. I have managed to use udev rules instead, thus the initialization sequence will run only if the device is actually present.\nNote that these are for the HP hs3110, which reports itself as a HP device, not a Huawei device—if you have a non-HP device, your device ID may be different than what is reported below.\nStep-by-step instructions:\nEnsure you have usb-modeswitch and usb-modeswitch-data installed (install them if they are missing).\nEdit /lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules, adding the following lines to the block of device rules:\n# HP hs3110 (Huawei MU736)\nATTR{idVendor}==\"03f0\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"521d\", RUN+=\"usb_modeswitch '%b/%k'\"\nATTR{idVendor}==\"03f0\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"521d\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash -c 'modprobe option && echo 03f0 521d > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/option1/new_id'\"\n\nInstall wvdial.\nEdit /etc/wvdial.conf, appending the following section:\n[Dialer 3G]\nInit2 = ATZ\nInit3 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0\nInit5 = AT+CGDCONT=1,\"IP\"\nISDN = 0\nModem = /dev/ttyUSB2\nModem Type = Analog Modem\nBaud = 460800\n\nThe next time you reboot and log in, you will be prompted for your PIN.

How do you compare Ubuntu Server to Snappy Ubuntu Core for a single-board computer (SBC)? From what I've read I understand that the package managing system is different in Snappy. But, in general terms, what are the main differences between these two operating systems?\nI have experience with Ubuntu Server on several different SBCs. What should I expect when installing Snappy for the first time in one of them? Will I be able to use it and run my programs the same way I did with Ubuntu Server?\n\nA: No. Even though, Snappy is Ubuntu and completely compatible with other Ubuntu installs you will not be able to install and run pre-packaged applications. \nSnappy introduces transactional updates and moves away from the repository paradigm. Meaning there are very few packages out there for Snappy currently, given its short existence. It also sports a read-only file-system in two partitions in order to be able to do quick roll-backs.\nThat is also the only difference between Ubuntu Server and Snappy. Snappy is really only a way to update and/or extend your system, it fills the function of apt-get. Here's Mark's explanation as to what Snappy really is. However, Snappy is mostly released and marketed in connection with Ubuntu Core as a base OS. When you download images referring to Snappy, it will be with Ubuntu Core as a base.\n\nUbuntu Core is a minimalist Ubuntu installation. It existed before and without Snappy, but it seems that Ubuntu Core and Snappy are\n  becoming the same thing. The Ubuntu Core website is now a link to\n  Snappy. Anyways, here's some basic info\n\nIn addition, the arm architecture has even fewer alternatives as of right now (I'm assuming this is relevant to you, if you're going to run it on SBC). On my armhf based install (on a beaglebone) there are currently around 20 different applications available for install. However that is a 15.04 beta install. I am unsure if you are able to install Snappy on older stable Ubuntu Core installs, and whether that will give you more options. \nCanonical's Dustin Kirkland has a great write-up about what use-cases Snappy Ubuntu covers here. \n", "Q: Does the Gluglug ThinkPad X200 work with Ubuntu? I'm looking at buying the Lenovo ThinkPad X200 from Gluglug and they say they have Libreboot so you can install any OS, but I'm wondering if the hardware would work with Ubuntu, and if so, which version?\nCan I install the newest update and it will work, or an older one? Do the RAM and HD specs matter? (I'm thinking about 2GB of RAM and 120 GB SSD)\n\nA: The Libreboot X200 comes with Trisquel GNU/Linux pre-installed. http://shop.gluglug.org.uk/about/\nTrisquel is based on Ubuntu. Trisquel 7 \"LTS\" is based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, I believe. My understanding is that Trisquel is Ubuntu with every last bit of non-Free software ripped out (plus other features like its own \"...customized version of the GNOME Flashback desktop environment\"). https://trisquel.info/en/wiki/documentation See also the wikipedia entry for Trisquel.\nGiven the above, I would not foresee any problems running Ubuntu, though I cannot advise on current Ubuntu RAM requirements.\n\nA: I've been running Lubuntu on an X200 for several years, not as my main computer, but as a frequently used backup. Upgraded through several new releases. It works great! Used for web browsing primarily, used Thunderbird for some time but stopped in favor of web mail, occasionally use LibreOffice, occasionally Slack, Pinta for light image editing...\nI believe I have 5GB RAM though (1GB + 4 GB chips). I have the original (non-SSD) drive in it. Highly recommended, but I can't speak to whether 2GB is enough for a tolerable experience.\nIt took very little tweaking when I first set it up, and I've had no trouble during release upgrades. I think I initially had trouble getting it to work properly with the WiFi chip (not a driver issue, but a user interface issue that prevented me from seeing a list of networks to connect to) -- but I think that was resolved several revisions ago. (Also possible I'm remembering a different laptop, though.)\nGood luck!\n\nA: You can refer to thinkwiki.org, which is a great source when using Linux on Thinkpads.\nEspecially, this page http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_9.10_%28Karmic_Koala%29_on_a_ThinkPad_X200 seems to suggest X200 should work just fine with Ubuntu (well, it is an outdated version of Ubuntu, but newer versions should work at least as well).\n", "Q: installing libg2-dev on ubuntu 10.04 lucid I am trying to install libg2-dev on my ubuntu 10.04.\nI did it from synaptic package manager and also used sudo apt-get install libg2-dev.\nWhen I am trying to configure a source code for a software I use ./configure\nThis is what I am getting which is a warning because of which I cannot create PS output(graph)\nWARNING: libg2.a is missing.\nWhen i look at the configure file of my software(I want to install), this is what is written when i searched for libg2.a\n**{ $as_echo \"$as_me:${as_lineno-$LINENO}: result: $ac_cv_lib_g2_g2_open_vd\" >&5\n$as_echo \"$ac_cv_lib_g2_g2_open_vd\" >&6; }\nif test \"x$ac_cv_lib_g2_g2_open_vd\" = x\"\"yes; then :\n  cat >>confdefs.h <<_ACEOF\n#define HAVE_LIBG2 1\n_ACEOF\n  LIBS=\"-lg2 $LIBS\"\nelse\n  { $as_echo \"$as_me:${as_lineno-$LINENO}: WARNING: libg2.a is missing.

Update: It did not.\n\nA: install a proprietary driver\nSince you are gaming this is the first thing you should do. You need to enable non-free sources so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*go to Edit -> Software Sources\n\n*Enable the \"Proprietary drivers for devices (restricted)\" option.\n\n*Close the Software center\n\n*run sudo apt-get update to make sure things are up to date\n\n*go to your systems settings -> additional drivers\n\n*select the newest (usually recommended) proprietary driver, this will not be Nouveau\n\n*After the install is finished, reboot and continue.\n\n\n\nSolutions To Use Your New Driver:\n\nCheck your BIOS\nCheck for an option to disable Intel Integrated Graphics, with integrated graphics disabled your system will default to the Nvidia card, but if you want to switch between Nvidia and Intel without rebooting every time, or your BIOS doesn't have the setting, these other solutions may work for you.\n\nbumblebee\nAfter installing using sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia primus linux-headers-generic and rebooting, you simply need to put optirun or primusrun in front of any command you want to optimize using the GPU. In the case of steam you need to right click the game in your library and select properties->set launch options and set the command to\noptirun %command%\n\n(substituting optirun for primusrun also works, you may test both to see if there is a performance difference for your system)\n\nnvidia-prime\nThis is supposed to be included with the newer driver packages, but if it is not, you should be able to install it with sudo apt-get install nvidia-prime after installing and rebooting you will be able to manually select the card to use from the nvidia-settings menu. In order to switch from one to the other you will need to log out and back in.\n\nPlease Note:\nIf you install one of these, uninstall it BEFORE installing the other or you will be met with a black screen on boot up. Should this happen to you just Ctrl+Alt+F1 into a terminal and uninstall it manually, if you have your GUI working but get stuck in this terminal the GUI is usually reached by Ctrl+Alt+F7 (If not, just Ctrl+Alt+F around until you find it)\n", "Q: Software center crashes on Ubuntu 14.04 After I run the software center in terminal it says:\nbizara@BlackHole2:~$ software-center\n2015-02-24 19:27:53,480 -

I would like to use pub/private keys but I guess unsure of their use. Would each user have to have their own private and public key? Each user has a different public key and then one private key on the server machine? Or just one public key distributed to each user and one private key? I would really like to make sure I understand and fully learn this important concept! Thank you all!\n\nA: Public/Private keys are meant for administrators who manage many servers\nImagine you have installed Ubuntu in various family members' computer, who live in different cities. Periodically they call you to fix their computers. You want to remotely connect to these computers and fix them. This is where you may want to use public/private keys. The public keys will go to your various family members' computers. The private key stays safely with you. You can give the public key to anyone without any security risks. If your uncle's computer gets stolen with your public key, you need not worry about it. Just make another copy of your public key and put it in your uncle's new computer.\nThis is not the model of operation you have in mind. You have 30 users accessing one server. So each will need a separate pair of public and private keys. That is 30 private and 30 public keys.\nPublic/Private keys are not for normal mail and web services\nPublic/private key pairs are used in ssh protocol. I don't think they apply for mail and web services. There is a situation where public/private key pair is used in mail. That is for PGP or GPG encryption, where the receiver of the mail can be sure that it came from the sender. Here imagine you are planning a coup against your president. You want to send encrypted emails to your 30 followers. Most importantly your followers must be 100 percent sure that the email is from you and not from someone else trying to foil your plans. You create your private/public pair of keys and give a copy of the public key to your 30 follower. You encrypt your email using the private key. If your email can be decrypted by your followers using your public key, they will be 100 percent sure it came from you. This has nothing to do with how you or your your followers access the mail server. The encryption/ decryption is done in your/followers' computer.\nIn conclusion...\nUnless you are planning to (1) give the 30 users command line access to the server using ssh protocol, or (2) you want all the users to use end-to-end encrypted emails, the public/private key is not for the situation you described.\nIf you envision (1) or (2) then each user will need to create their own private / public key pair.\nFor situation (1) all the 30 public keys will need to be stored in the ssh server that each user will have authorization to connect to.\nFor situation (2) each user will need to create their own private/public key pair. Then each user will need their own private key and the public keys of all the other 29 users to be able to read encrypted emails from the other users in this group.\nHope this helps\n\nA:  Would each user have to have their own private and public key? \n\nif you want key based login and if that user need to login to the server then the user should have a public-private key pair of their own.\n`Each user has a different public key and then one private key on the server machine?Or just one public key distributed to each user and one private key?`\n\nEach user has his own public-private key pair. The private key is \"Private\", you must not share the private key with anyone. Whereas the Public key as the name suggests is \"Public\" and can be shared with as many servers you want.\nLets say you have your account having the same username (this is important) on 10 servers, you just need to create a key-pair. Now your Private key will just stay on your computer and you need to copy the same public key of yours to your home directory of 10 servers. Now when you will be trying to ssh into any of these servers you will be able to login without password. One important point to remember that key-pair is an attribute of username not the user's computer so you can use the private key for the user foo in another computer too (given there is no passphrase to unlock the key) that has the identical username foo to ssh into the servers.\nHere is how to set up the key-based authentication.\n\nA: The Ask Ubuntu community wiki page is a great introduction to the topic here\nIt helps to get your head round it, and shows you the steps to set key based logins. The answer that @heemayl gave sums up how the key pairs are used. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: 14.04: How to use NVIDIA Graphics instead of Intel integrated graphics? I previously tried to install my nvidia graphics card driver more than 50 times when this version was released (14.04) and every time i always got either blank screen, terminal only with no x-server or it would go back to the first alternative driver there was when it was installed.\nThis was the only reason why i stopped using linux (ubuntu). now im trying to give it another try but i need real detailed help and guidance.

Literally any other nvidia driver will leave me with the same problem you are describing. It seems like its hit or miss with this Optimus technology. Hopefully we will get a good update for it in the near future.\n\nA: If you can not start X server go into a tty terminal (CTL+ALT+F2)\nUpdate :\n    sudo apt-get update and make sure that x server is installed sudo dpkg -l | grep xserver\nThere are 2 approaches to installing the Nvidia graphics driver(s).\n\n\n*\n\n*Install them with the apt package manager  apt-cache search nvidia\nYou should then see a list of available drivers to choose from. Run: apt-get install nvidia 3XX\nYou may also need to install 'libgl' as well as the nvidia settings:apt-cache search nvidia-settings\n\n*Download the proprietary Nvidia graphics drivers for your respective GPU (you may need to add Nvidia to the apt/sources.list). Then run the install script (the install script may add Nvidia to the apt/sources.list file)\nThen, reboot.\n\n", "Q: How to automatically update Atom editor?

I'm about to buy a new laptop that comes with a hybrid HD with a 8GB SSD. \n\nA: Yes. According to their site, Ubuntu with a GUI only requires 5GB of Hard Disk storage, although any other programs you may install will be above and beyond this total.\n\nA: Yes, hybrid drives work by storing pretty much all of the data on the magnetic disk while using the SSD portion to cache commonly used data so you can access it much quicker than if you were to get it directly from the magnetic disk. On most hybrid drives this is done by the firmware on disk at a base level and doesn't involve the OS or drivers in any way at all.\nTo expand on this answer further, the root partition on my current Linux machine is at 7.62GBs which is lower than the SSD cache so it would be a fair conclusion that most of the data on the root partition would be copied to the SSD side of the drive as root data is essential for Ubuntu to operate and would be used most if not all the time.\n", "Q: Cannot use Thunderbird properly with proxy setting My laptop is running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. After setting the proxy in the system level, the softeware center and chrome browser can work well. But Thunderbird cannot.

And, as the software have similar setting, firefox can work well with all these setting. And, the skype can only login through the \"skype name\" option, \"microsoft account\" not working.\n\nA: I suspect there's something wrong with https support.\nIf the proxy is set to relay https traffic while it can't handle it then you'll have no connection.\nWhat happens if you try to go to https://www.google.com with firefox while the proxy is set?

The job is owned by root and only runs when I log in as root.  Once the job runs, it is logged in the /var/log/syslog, and the /var/spool/anacron/cron.weekly file is set to the date the job ran. All log files created by the job are created and show a successful completion.\nI have verified that the server is up at the time the job is supposed to run.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Make sure that you are actually running anacron regularly and not just when logged in as root. The line you posted from your crontab tests if anacron is executable and if it isn't will run your weekly scripts Saturdays at 00:01 AM—in particular, it does not run anacron even if present and executable.\nanacron needs regular opportunities to run, and each time will check and run any tasks that have come due. On my system (Arch, not Ubuntu), cron runs anacron hourly via a 0anacron script in /etc/cron.hourly.\n", "Q: A huge apt log file from failed upgrade - what went wrong & how do I fix it? When attempting to upgrade from the 12.04 to a newer LTS it seemed to hang for ages (a good day or two) on \"preparing for upgrade\" and then the whole system started to suffer. Eventually I rebooted and found that starting was not going to happen due to the HDD being full.

When the process was halfway suddenly the power died and now when I turn on my laptop I see a black screen. I have tried many things but they do not help. The BIOS is working but I can't return to the previous version of Windows XP.\n\nA: When you began running the Linux installation, did you choose to install Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*over Windows, that is to say on the same partition that windows was on, or\n\n*along side Windows, on a separate [new] partition?\n\n\nAssuming it was the former option, you will have lost your Windows XP partition if, as you say, the Linux install got halfway. This is because the drive/partition may have been reformatted, and/or partially over written. You will not be able to recover your Windows XP in this scenario. Your best option in this case, is to reattempt the Linux install. \nIf you chose the second option, then your Windows XP partition may still be there, and maybe recoverable. However, you will need to fix the boot loader (grub/LILO).  The easiest way to do this is to reattempt the Linux install. If it is a recent version of Linux, then it should detect that you have a Windows OS already installed and automatically set up your bootloader for you, such that you will have the option to boot into Windows or Linux.\nIn short, for either of the two installation methods, your best bet is to reinstall the Linux OS again, and hope that you have no further power outages.\nAs an aside, if you are having continual power interruptions, it may be worth considering investing in an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS).\nBTW, in your question, you have omitted a few details:\n\n\n*\n\n*What version of Linux are you using? Was it Ubuntu?\n\n*You also say that you have tried \"many things\"... What exactly have\nyou tried?\n\n", "Q: How to correctly configure nova-compute to use FlatDHCPManager I am trying to deploy Openstack using FlatDHCPManager.

I want know where are saved by default the data base made with mysql-workbench. I want know the directory.\n\nA: MySQL is a database and you're expected to interact with the database through tools (MySQL Workbench, the mysql command line tool, etc.) rather than directly interact with the files on disk. \nIn order to do a backup, for instance, you would do an SQL dump of your database rather than copying the database files themselves.\nTo find the files, run the SQL command show variables where Variable_Name = \"datadir\" — but again, you shouldn't interact directly with these files on a regular basis. \n", "Q: Why kde keep asking password when i use chrome even if the password is not saved? I have not saved the password of a website, but kde keep asking me that password and I find this annoying. :|\n\nA: Assuming you're using Chromium, Chromium will use the system's password manager instead of its own password manager.

Please resume and shutdown\nWindows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\nread-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\n\nA: This isn't a certain solution, but it may help you narrow it down and possibly fix it. If you have a USB thumbdrive, pull \"Multisystem\" off the Software Center. It allows you to install live (and persistent) Linux OSs to the stick you can boot up with (you just need the .ISO images to feed it. Other Operating Systems too).\nThen, just tell your system to boot from USB. Typically re-booting and hitting either F2 or F11 while the first flash-screen appears will drop you into BIOS, and you can put USB temporarily at the top of the boot device list.\nThis accomplishes two things... Multiboot comes with its own GRUB (and GRUB tools). It can give you a totally independent assessment of your partitions. Then when you boot up into a distro, you'll have a clean OS to compare to working OS.\nSorry I can't be more help, but that's how I figured out I had a corrupted GRUB2. I then just re-ran GRUB from the USB key and that fixed it.\nWhen you're done, go back to BIOS and re-set your primary boot device. Leaving USB or CD ROM at top leaves you vulnerable (but you already know that : ) Hope that helps. I'm far from a linux guru; but it did it for me.

In other words, you have a bad sector.  You should check dmesg or /var/log/kern.log to see if there are more detailed error messages bout the drive, as well as the SMART health in the disk utility, and if the drive has many reallocated or pending bad sectors, you need to back up what you can and replace the drive at once.  If it is only one or two, then you may be able to repair it.  Have a look around for questions relating to bad sectors for more information on that.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't boot from my Sony vaio SSD laptop I have tried booting ubuntu 14.04 with DVD, but screen just goes black and stuck on vaio icon, nothing happens.\nIs there a problem with my SSD (is sony ultra book)?

All righty, I am a bit new at this, so bear with me. I've been using windows for a long time and have a decent amount of know-how with it's interface, and I decided I wanted to try out some different ones. I'd heard a bit about Linux's Ubuntu and decided to try out Ubuntu on the advice of my professor. So far, I've had a couple of problems, and I'd love any advice on how to fix it. I'm trying to dual boot Windows 7 (64-bit) and any distribution of Linux 64 bit that will work. My system specs are as follows:\nDell Inspiron 3721\nIntel i3-3227U CPU\n4 GB RAM\n500 GB Hard disk space\nWindows 7 64-bit Operating System\nSo far, my experience has been this:\nI downloaded the Ubuntu 14.4 64 bit ISO, then used disk management in windows 7 to resize the primary partition. I shrunk it by 100 GB and left it unallocated. When I finished that, I downloaded pen drive linux to install the ISO onto a 2 GB flash drive. (I have been having problems with my DVD drive, windows seems to enjoy playing red light green light with the DVD RW icon so I can't make a disk.) When I finished making an ISO, I booted from the flash drive and during the installation process I found that ubuntu couldn't auto detect windows 7 and install it alongside the primary partition. I quit the installation and reloaded Windows, then downloaded 13.10 and found that to be no different. I then tried 12.4, and it got me as far as being able to install alongside windows 7 without removing the Operating system. \n\"Success!\" I thought as I waited for it to finish downloading the packages and formatting the unallocated space. When it finished installing 12.4 64 bit, I rebooted, and it went straight into my windows partition. From what I had seen from dual boot installation videos on youtube, there should have been a screen to select which OS I wanted to load, but no dice. \nI decided to see what would happen if I booted from my flash drive again using \"try ubuntu before installing\" and according to that, both of the partitions are formatted. I rebooted Windows, and it doesn't have the partition listed. \nFrom what I can tell, Ubuntu is installed, but I can't open it. Ideally I would like to have the most recent edition installed, but I don't think I can do it alone anymore. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Johnathon I will explain how I installed Ubuntu along side with Windows 7.\nJust like you I have also used an USB device to install the OS. When the it asks for where to install, i.e, if you want to install along side with windows or to completely wipe the hardrive and install it as new or something else, select the last option and proceed. On the next window click on the partition you created and format it into 'etx4 journal'. Then type the mount point as '/'. You also have to create a swap partition of 1 or 2 GB. Then proceed with the installation.\nAfter installing Ubuntu, log into it and open the terminal window by 'Ctrl+Alt+T' and type in the following command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nPress 'Enter' after typing in the command and type in your password(terminal will not echo the password).\nThe reason for the above step is that, when you install Ubuntu the bootloader in it(Grub2) will replace the default windows bootloader, which cannot detect any other operating systems other than windows. Grub2 will not search for windows automatically, that's why you have to give the command.\nEnjoy Freedom!\n", "Q: GRUB not showing windows 8.1 already installed Actually there is a similar question on the community before as well but what I am facing is a different problem.

This includes the part after |, so changes to each buffer is saved (up).\n\n*q quits, which exits Vim since we are now at the last buffer.\n\n\nA: You can use combination of find and its -ok command.

Creating the containers and initializing them is slow.\nIs there an alternative tool (or maybe some fancy way of using lxc) that is -- just like arkose -- ephemeral and instantly created from the current state?\n\nA: You can use lxc-start-ephemeral. It creates an overlayfs (and by default backs it with a tmpfs so it's in memory and crazy fast). Once you shut down the container, the overlayfs goes away (unless you specified --keep-data, in which case the overlay is kept around).\nA downside versus arkose (which I never used, though, so I don't know) is that you have to create the \"base\" container, so that will take a bit of time, the first time it's created. So the sequence goes:\nlxc-create -n trusty-base -t ubuntu -- -r trusty  # This will take a bit of time\nlxc-start-ephemeral -d -n trusty-working -o trusty-base # This will be nearly instant\nlxc-destroy -n trusty-working # No trace of the container will be left\nlxc-destroy -n trusty-base\nlxc-create -n trusty-base -t ubuntu -- -r trusty # This will be faster than the first time due to local caching of required files\n\n", "Q: Broadcom 43142 is not working | HELP!

[NOT a duplicate] This original question has NOT been answered and is NOT a duplicate question so I am reasking it: Way to remove unwanted/unused wifi networks from Network Indicator Menu?\n\nThere should be a way to stop the Network Indicator menu from displaying completely unused/unwanted Wifi network entries in the dropdown.\nOn my indicator menu, there are more than a dozen networks displayed but I only ever connect to one. Why do I have to do deal with selecting from so many networks when I only ever connect to one? I should be able to configure Network Indicator to only display the one wifi network I connect to (the one wifi network that shows up in Network-Indicator > Edit Connections > Wifi).\nHow can I hide/remove the networks that I never use?\n\nIf any of the moderators bothered to read the original question and the so-called duplicate, they would understand they are not the same question. I am not asking about networks I have connected to. I am asking about the display of networks I have NEVER connected to. Networks I will NEVER connect to. I want to hide these networks from showing in the Network Indicator dropdown. The question this is supposed to be a duplicate of does not ask about this and none of the answers from that question even attempt an answer of what I am asking.\nThe comments from my original post of this question clearly delineate on how my question is NOT a duplicate.\n\nsee askubuntu.com/questions/227297/… –  Rinzwind 21 hours ago\n\nThat will not prevent Networkmanager from showing the networks in the list; it will only prevent reconnecting to them if there has ever been a connection. –  Jos 21 hours ago\n\n@Jos If they are within scan range, they will appear. If not, say, for example, a network he joined at the cyber cafe, they will be removed. –  chili555 21 hours ago\n\nAs I understand it, there are more than a dozen networks within scan range, and OP doesn't want to see those. That is not the same as removing networks he has ever joined. –  Jos 21 hours ago\n\nYes, Jos is correct. I have never connected to any of the shown networks. I will never connect to them. And yet they are always displayed. At a minimum it seems there should be a way to move them to the \"More networks\" folder/container. Most of the networks show up there. But why can't all unused networks show there? The dropdown menu should only display networks I can/want to connect to. –  user308393 20 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: If you wish to change to manual methods, I suggest you open a terminal and do:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/network/interfaces\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Amend the file to:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n#auto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\nwpa-ssid <your_network>\nwpa-psk <your_key_in_clear_text>\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNotice I have commented out the 'auto eth0' line. This implies you will use wireless by default. The system will only start wireless on boot. If you wish to stop wireless and start ethernet, in a terminal:\nsudo ifdown wlan0 && sudo ifup -v eth0\n\nThe -v for verbose will show enough information for you to see that the system connects.

My best theory is that updating either the kernel or xorg changes something that breaks my graphics drivers.\nI am using the Nvidia 346.35 64 bit proprietary drivers downloaded from nvidia.com and my graphics card is a GeForce GTX 970.\n\nThe issue seems to be a problem with DKMS, however, when installing the Nvidia drivers if I select the yes option on Would you like to register the kernel module sources with DKMS? This will allow DKMS to automaticalty build a new module, if you install a different kernel later. I get the error below.\nERROR: Unable to load the kernal module!\n\n[25961, 788963] systemd-udevd[1735]: Failed to apply ACL on /dev/dri/card0: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: Yes, the nvidia driver uses a kernel module.  When the nvidia driver, VirtualBox, ndiswrapper, and one or two other packages are installed, they hook into a system called dkms.  DKMS will automatically build copies of these modules for any new kernel that is installed (after the package manager installs linux-whatever-image and linux-whatever-headers, it runs dkms which rebuilds these modules one-by-one).  \nSo, Ubuntu 14.04 only has nvidia-331 drivers in it's usual packages.  But, the solution if you want dkms to do it's thing and have these newer drivers is to add a new software source: ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nWith xorg-edgers added as a software source, you should find nvidia-346 packages are listed, and indeed newer ones should be listed as they come out.  This repo is meant to for installing newer video drivers than your distro would have otherwise, both stable drivers that are just a bit newer, and \"bleeding edge\" development versions.  So I wouldn't be surprised if the newest nvidia package doesn't come out same day nvidia releases it.\n\nPlan B, if you don't want to do that:  dkms doesn't really need you to have a package to work. Per the man page, it looks as though you can add a arbitrary kernel module source tree into dkms and it'll take care of the rest.  The nvidia .run file places a kernel module build directory somewhere or other, pull it into dkms and it should take care of itself. \n", "Q: Not able to boot 32bit from 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04 for installation My machine runs on 2GB RAM since the  64bit is hungry for more memory i thought of downgrading to 32bit to avoid slowness.\nI downloaded 32  bit iso file and extracted the same to pendrive.\nWhen restarted the 32bit doesn't ask for installation.\n\nA: If you extracted perfectly, then go to boot options while restarting the computer(normally pressing f12 or f9 for many computers) and select the flashdrive and install it.\nIf you think you didn't extract it properly, then download \"iso to usb\" software which makes the pendrive bootable and do the above process. \n", "Q: gedit not working in ssh session: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed when I try using gedit in an SSH Session, I get this:\nmax@amancer:/etc$ gedit SWARM.txt\n\n** (gedit:24616): WARNING **: Befehlszeile »dbus-launch --autolaunch=b3945c581ae43ae601b4b5190000000c --binary-syntax --close-stderr« brach mit von Null verschiedenem Beenden-Status 1 ab: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.\\n\nAnzeige kann nicht geöffnet werden: \nFühren Sie »gedit --help« aus, um die Liste der verfügbaren Befehlszeilenoptionen zu sehen.\nmax@amancer:/etc$ sudo bash -c 'echo $DISPLAY'\n\n\nA: ssh session normally do not forward (i.e., make available) the X11 connection on the other side. \nssh -X (or better ssh -Y) will enable remote graphical clients to open windows locally. \nThis does not work: \n[romano:~] 130 % ssh zzzz\nLast login: Sun Feb 22 21:35:08 2015 from XX.YY.ZZ\n[romano@zzzz:~] % gedit\n\n(gedit:11225): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: \n\nBut this will work:\n[romano:~] 1 % ssh -Y zzzz\nLast login: Wed Feb 25 14:51:25 2015 from localhost\n[romano@zzzz:~] % gedit\n[romano@zzzz:~] % exit\n\nConsider however that the connection can be slow --- the X protocol is not efficient over slow networks.

On the Windows host I have the following ipconfig information for my VMNet8 adapter. \nEthernet adapter VMware Network Adapter VMnet8:\n\nConnection-specific DNS Suffix  . :\nDescription . . . . . . . . . . . : VMware Virtual Ethernet Adapter for VMnet8\nPhysical Address. . . . . . . . . : 00-50-56-C0-00-08\nDHCP Enabled. . . . . . . . . . . : No\nAutoconfiguration Enabled . . . . : Yes\nIPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.28.1(Preferred)\nSubnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0\nDefault Gateway . . . . . . . . . :\nNetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Enabled\n\nFor my Ubuntu machine I have put the following in /etc/network/interfaces\nauth eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.28.12\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.28.2\ndns-nameservers 192.168.28.2\n\nWith this information I can only ping other virtual machines and the internet by IP address. Using the machine name or www.google.com will not work. \nIf I add 8.8.8.8 as a dns-nameserver as well I can of course hit the internet by using google.com, but I still have to use an IP for my internal network. I need some help on this, I have tried multiple things. I have to believe it's not an issue with my Hosts configuration since it works on my Windows machines just fine. \nNOTE: If I change Ubuntu to get IP via DHCP I can ping other virtual machines on my network, but still not internet name resolution. I also can not SSH into the Ubuntu machine.\n\nA: from your configuration, you are using NAT however assigning the IP address manually from the range in your router. Usually the VMWare or VBox NAT has different IP Range Pool than the actual router's (192.168.x.x). As you are using the 192.168.28.12, you need to switch the network from NAT to Bridged mode. Your gateway is 192.168.28.2, how do you know? as per the output result for your vmware adapter the gateway is 28.1 \nIf you really want to use the NAT then you need to add the routing entry. Can you paste the output of your routing table?\nIn addition, find out the NAT Pool IP range in your hypervisor.\n", "Q: Getting gpg key error while installing RVM While installing rvm I get the following error.

This post: What rendering engine does Nautilus use to show HTML previews/thumbnails? seems obsolete (no entries in dconf for them), and Generate thumbnails for text? would help (but it's unanswered). \nLook at this composed shot: \n\nIn the laptop the thumbnails have a small excerpt of the content of the file (the real content) while in my desktop they are simply blank. \nI dug a bit around but I can't find which option/package is responsible of the laptop behavior (which I do prefer, by the way). \nHow can I enable the \"text snapshot\" in thumbnails? (And if they had syntax highlighting, like in the linked question, it would be great). \n\nA: It seems for an icon theme to let Nautilus display the contents of plain text files as thumbnails, its sub-directory for mime types, which might be named, for example, mimes or mimetypes should have a file named text-x-preview.icon (along with an icon file named text-x-preview.png or text-x-preview.svg, etc. serving as a backdrop for the file contents thumbnail), which is actually a plain text file including settings for the thumbnail, in each sub-directory for different icon sizes (for example, 22, 24, 48).\nFor example, I have added ~/.local/share/icons/Nitrux/mimetypes/48/text-x-preview.icon (imported from the default Humanity icon theme) to my current icon theme, and only then it has begun displaying thumbnails for plain text files, which has the following content:\n[Icon Data]\nEmbeddedTextRectangle=180,100,680,900\nAttachPoints=750,750|750,250|250,250|250,750\n\nI'll hopefully try and add more information about the settings above in due course.\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems having text-x-preview.icon and text-x-preview.svg (or another valid image file type) in the sub-directory for size 48px allows Nautilus to display thumbnails for all sizes from 48px upwards, but not for sizes below 48px, for which you also need text-x-preview.icon and text-x-preview.svg (or another valid image file type) at least in the sub-directories for sizes 22px and 24px (this lets Nautilus to display thumbnails also for 16px in some but not all icon themes).\n\n\nThese two files in the Humanity icon theme have exactly the same content:\n[Icon Data]\nEmbeddedTextRectangle=180,100,680,900\n\n\nNOTE: Unfortunately this whole thing no longer works under Ubuntu 15.04\n", "Q: Shortcut to execute shell scipt? I'm trying to create a shortcut that will run a .sh file deep in some directory without having to navigating to the absolute path.\nI have tried using aliases, which did not work as. \nUsing soft/hard links, they did not work too as there are certain dependencies in that directory which the shell script reference to.\nAnyone has any idea how to ./ a file without having to traverse down that absolute path?\nThe alias I have tried is : \nalias minecraft='/var/www/owncloud/data/admin/files/Spigot/start.sh'\n\nI have tried the Path variant by adding PATH=/var/www/owncloud/data/admin/files/Spigot:\"$PATH\" into  ~/.bashrc.\nWhich then brings the message :\nError: Unable to access jarfile spigot.jar\n\nI'm using a cli version of Ubuntu if it helps, so no Nautilus. \n\nA: You didn't setup your alias correctly, you should setup it like so: alias minecraft='sh /var/www/owncloud/data/admin/files/Spigot/start.sh'\n\nA: You are getting the \nError: Unable to access jarfile spigot.jar\n\nErrormessage because the script are using your bash environment working directory when it is executing. The script is probably executing java -jar spigot.jar where spigot.jar file must reside in the same directory. Since youre scripts environment is pointing at another directory the file cannot be found.\nTo fix this, edit your /var/www/owncloud/data/admin/files/Spigot/start.sh file and add this line just above the command where it is executing java. \ncd \"$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )\"\n\nThis command changes the current executing directory for the script to the directory it resides.\nThe result should be something like:\n #!/bin/bash\n\n cd \"$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )\"\n java -jar spigot.jar\n\nThen you can use the alias you mentioned in your question, or probably along with many of the other answers that is here.\nGood luck!\n\nA: To get rid of the \"./\" expression for your script, You must have to set the custom path for your scripts in PATH variable. You can do it either using the export Command ( which will set up the variable under current running environment) or as below (for permanent solution)\nTo do so; Edit the .bashrc file in your home directory with your favorite Editor\n\nvi .bashrc\n\nat the end of the file you can paste the following code.\n#custom variable\nexport PATH=$PATH:/$HOME/bin:/var/www/owncloud/data/admin/files/Spigot/\n\nAbove command sets up the additonal paths for your script file location, in this case your .sh script in Spigot folder.\nOne thing you must remember while exporting the path is either you have to copy the contents of existing PATH variable into a file or in a text file using other editor you can do echo $PATH >> variables.txt\nReason why I'm saying so is if in case you lost the variable path, you wont be able to run other commands at all with aliases.\nFinally: type\n exec bash\nI have tested it hope it works fine for you as well. You should also be able to run the script without typing the full path. It should work as  start.sh\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Help: “aptd” is maxing out my CPU? I am running Ubuntu 12.04 and have a \"aptd\" process running as root (which I understand is correct) but eating 95% CPU (which is definitely not right).\nAs per one of the answers here How to stop \"aptd\" from maxing out my CPU? I tried to run dpkg-reconfigure which just added a new process eating 20% CPU for ages until it reported\n  /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: menu is broken or not fully installed.\n\nPossibly related the upgrade process recently left a huge apt.log file without getting to the end: A huge apt log file from failed upgrade - what went wrong & how do I fix it?\nWhat do I need do to get my system back into normal operation?\nUPDATE #1\nThis bug report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/665580 suggests I run\n sudo apt-get -y update\n\nBut it says\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/\n\nSo I tried\nsudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock\nsudo apt-get -y update\n\nThis has not stopped aptd from maxing the CPU.\nDespite warnings not to I have tried to kill the process and it refuses to be killed.\nUpdate #2\nThis is now slowly cooking my CPU and the fans are on full speed all of the time. Man they are loud (must do something about that next hardware upgrade).\naptd is running with the command line /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/aptd and apparent has used 1d17h CPU Time. \nHowever it has now been joined by apt-get which is running under the command line apt-get -qq -y -d -dist-upgrade. As a result aptd has \"dropped\" to 85.1MiB Memory with 183.8MiB Virtual Memory used up.\nI am looking at restarting or shutting down, if only to save my hardware from cooking.\nUpdate #3\nAs per ShadowMitia's comments I tried\nsudo killall -9 apt-get\nsudo kill -9 _pid_ \n\nWhich killed the naughty processes. Now to figure out what was broken and fix that?\nI am going to try restarting to see if it happens again.\nUpdate #4\nOkay, so I just restarted.\napt-check got in there right away and shot to about 88% aptd  then joined in and climbed rapidly to 100% to 102%.\napt-check is still there but at 40% to 50%.\nLooks like I will need to kill those off sooner or later?\nUpdate 5\nApt-check and aptd were still burning away after over 24 hours of CPU time. I killed them off again. Will try upgrading and report back.\n\nA: From what I could find here and here you have to do the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kill apt-get and aptd process. Use killall -9 pid (where pid is the process id which you can find by running top). -9 is required to make sure the process is terminated.\n\n*Then you need to try \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh -a and sudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n\n*(optional) If all of the above steps work on their own then you should be fine but I would recommend you update to a more recent version of ubuntu, because it appears it was a bug in the way apt-get worked and should've been removed completly in a more recent release. Maybe a simple apt-get update && apt-get upgrade is sufficient (and would be quite ironic!).\n\n", "Q: Generic problem with networkmanager on Ubuntu 12.04 / elementaryOS Hello together: Since some days I've got issues with the networkmanager under Ubuntu 12.04. To be concrete it is the nm-applet itself. I can connect via LAN or WLAN without problems, but some entries within the applet are disabled and not usable. So I can't disconnect or create new VPN-connection using the submenu for exmaple. Also I can't edit my network-connection. The call of nm-connection-editor using the terminal is possible so far. But it is irritating and not very helpful having the applet in this state. Has somebody experience what is causing this issue?\n\nA: I think I've found a solution: From my point of view it seems to be an error within the last upate of the package network-manager-gnome, which was released 2015-02-16 (http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/precise/main/updates/network-manager-gnome). I've tried to find the concrete error and so I've tried to use an older package version: The problem was no more present and the applet is useful as always. The problem within: The unity-greeter was also updated and breaks the package. The final solution for now is little easier: \n\n\n*\n\n*Just download the deb-package for your platform (amd64 or i386) (http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/network-manager-gnome).\n\n*Unpack the concurrent deb-package and copy the included version of nm-applet under /usr/bin/nm-applet - make a copy / backup of your present version.\n\n*Restart your system and everything should work as always.\n\n", "Q: SOCKS proxy to SSH server behind HTTP proxy I set up a SOCKS proxy at port 9090 to computer B elsewhere:\nssh -D localhost:9090 user@B\n\nand configured it in my local Google Chrome browser.\nHowever, computer B is behind an HTTP proxy, so HTTP requests originating locally get to computer B through the SOCKS proxy but can't be addressed (terminal running ssh -D localhost:9090 user@B shows \"open failed: connect failed: No route to host\" when such a request is made).\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*setting up BOTH remote HTTP proxy (behind which computer B is) and SOCKS proxy in Google Chrome,\n\n*running ssh -D localhost:9090 user@B with environment variable http_proxy properly set,\n\n*adding http_proxy=_proxy_address_ to the user's .bashrc on computer B;\n\n\nbut none worked.\nAnyone knows how to configure the SOCKS proxy so as to take into account the HTTP proxy behind which computer B is? Any method which does not involve changing SSHD or global configuration at the server would be prefered.\n\nA: You would do a lot better to \"forward\" the remote network's proxy server over SSH rather than using the built-in SOCKS server (which just expects a bare gateway-addressable network at the other end).\nssh -L 8080:internal_ip_of_proxy:8080 user@ssh_server\n\nThis exposes the proxy server locally, allowing you to set your browser's proxy settings to localhost:8080 and that will tunnel over SSH to the remote proxy.\nAnd you can apply this to any remote service. You could, for example, tunnel Imgur from your server (in effect a single-host proxy):\nssh -L 8080:imgur.com:80 user@ssh_host\n\nAnd on a local terminal:\ncurl --header 'Host: imgur.com' localhost:8080\n\nThe Host header is required otherwise curl will request a non-existent localhost site. You could also work around that by adding a line in /etc/hosts, resolving imgur.com to 127.0.0.1...

You wont be able to view the contents from that location directly such as by doing cd /dev/cdrom or ls . \nYou can mount this CD by creating a mount point or using the existing mount point such as /media\nrun the following command\n sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media\n #you can use your custom mount point as well if this is on your desktop or somewhere else\n\nFor more information on the mount command, You can read the manual pages by doing man mount\nThat's it. You should be able to see the files under  /media folder now.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: By default the system automatically mounts the cd.

This should make it 48:\necho \"Xcursor.size:48\" > ~/.Xresources && gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Interface cursor-scale-factor 2\n\nThe cursor is large in Ubuntu software center, all of the Libre Office programs and in several other pieces of software.\nBut when pointing it to the launcher, the top panel, in Nautilus and in browsers the cursor is still small. So this is not working properly...\n\nBetter method: Change the mouse cursor theme. There is a tool for that called galternatives and it is in the default repository: \nsudo apt-get install galternatives\n\nand follow these directions:\n\nPreliminary:\nPut new cursor folder in /usr/share/icons. Create cursor.theme file if\n  needed. You can get some themese on gnome-look.\nStart the program: \ngalternatives\n\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You are asked for your password. \n  \n*Select x-cursor-theme from the list\n  in the left. \n  \n*To add a new cursor, click 'Add' button and browse in the\n  popup window to the new cursor's directory in /usr/share/icons. \n  \n*Click\n  Open, and select the file cursor.theme \n  \n*Click ok. \n  \n*Click ok. \n  \n*New cursor\n  becomes available in the main window. \n  \n*Select it and close. \n  \n*It will\n  become active after log out.\n  \n  \n  For Unity: in addition to the above, use 'advanced settings' to\n  complete the job and change the gnome cursor.\n\n\nedit: it is a long standing bug. The bug also has a workaround \n", "Q: Automatically switch sound output device to Bluetooth headset & force to A2DP profile on connection My bluetooth headset (Plantronics Backbeat Go2) is connected just fine with my system, but there are several manual steps I have to take to make this work that I would very much like to have automated:\n\n\n*\n\n*After every reboot I have to run pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover in the terminal to get the device to connect at all.

I am not aware of any settings we can make to default a Bluetooth device to A2DP on connecting (but I cannot exclude that I missed a piece of documentation somewhere). This may be considered a bug.\nAt some time I wrote a script to establish Bluetooth connections using the Audio profile. This script was included in a little GUI Python application (bt-autoconnect on launchpad or through my ppa:takkat-nebuk/takkat) which amongst other tweaks does exactly this but it is more of a hack than a definite solution, and sadly it does not work with all adapters around but it will connect my Philips headset in A2DP mode first (even though sound settings still claim it was HFP but that's another issue).\n\nA: This worked for me: https://sandalov.org/blog/2146/\nInstructions copied here for posterity:\nAdd to /etc/pulse/default.pa to automatically switch pulseaudio sink to Bluez:\n\n.ifexists module-bluetooth-discover.so\nload-module module-bluetooth-discover\nload-module module-switch-on-connect  # Add this\n.endif\n\nModify/Create /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf to auto select A2DP profile (instead of HSP/HFP):\n\n[General]\nDisable=Headset # Add this\n\nApply changes:\n\npulseaudio -k # Restarts pulseaudio\n\n# You may need to turn your bluetooth headphones off, then back on\n\n", "Q: How can iget my Dell PC to recognize the Ubuntu live cd?

That's why you should create backups beforehand.\n\n\n*\n\n*The easiest “fix” is to re-format the partition, if you don't care about any data that may be recoverable.\n\n*If you're lucky, you can salvage most of the data with fsck, but you should create a raw copy of /dev/sda5 and work on the image, in case fsck makes things worse.\nYou can run fsck /path/to/image directly on the image file, but if you want to access the (hopefully) recovered files, you need to mount it with the loop option:\nsudo mount -r -o loop /path/to/image /path/to/mountpoint\n\nThis mounts the image read-only, since you only want to look at and salvage its data and not modify it (accidentally).\n\n*Lastly, if fsck doesn't help, you can try more low-level data recovery (assuming the partition contained an ext4 file system). You can use the (unaltered) disk image again, that you may have created earlier, in case you re-purposed the disk space for something else in the mean time.\nIn any case you should re-format the partition in the end. Don't keep using an obviously broken file system, even if you can fix it enough to salvage your data.\n", "Q: How to create xorg.config file? I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on a VM and my tutorial requires a xorg.config file, which I can't find.

Could someone explain it step by step please?\nEDIT: To clarify, the stop gdm bit is especially confusing, as gdm stop doesn't do anything and service gdm stop turns it into a black screen where I need to restart the system.\n\nA: In a terminal window:\nsudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nCopy/paste whatever you need there, then ctrl-o to save, ctrl-x to exit.\nUbuntu 14.04 has lightdm instead of gdm, and to stop lightdm, run\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\n", "Q: Using find to search for files containing a word I want to use the find command to find all files on the system that have the word fsck.\nI tried\nfind / -iname fsck\n\nand it started to search files but everything was permission denied.  When I try executing with sudo the command line just seems to hang.\nAm I on the right track here?  I am really stumped as to how to do this..\n\nA: Just to make sure it was a typo, I see your command has fckd instead of fsck.\nTypically how I would do it is:\nfind / -iname '*fsck*'\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the command took quite a while to complete but it should show results as it sees them.\nThe main thing is, you need the pattern to be a glob like you'd use with 'ls'.\nPutting the pattern in single quotes makes it so that your shell doesn't try to expand *fsck* into a list of matching files in your current directory prior to running the find command.  For example, if you had no files that matched *fsck* in your current directory the command run would end up being:\nfind / -iname\n\nOr if you had 3 files [ fsck.a fsck.b fsck.c ] in your current directory the command run would end up being\nfind / -iname fsck.a fsck.b fsck.c\n\nBy escaping or quoting the *fsck* the command ends up as you would expect it:\nfind / -iname *fsck*\n\nI believe you can also escape the *'s with \\*fsck\\*.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Or, for text within files as muru pointed out, but I d̶o̶n̶'̶t̶  didn't (thanks) have reputation points to followup.\ngrep -sinIR fsck * for globaly search regular expression and print   --supressing errors, ignoring case, returning line numbers, Ignore binary files, and do it Recursively,  * all files in the directory\nAs sparhawk pointed out locate is a handy tool.  locate -i nAmE to ignore case, -A for mutiple search terms, e.g., locate -iA fsck txt which will return all files inclusive of fsck and txt in the name with an updated database.\n\nA: To find files that contain fsck, you need to use wildcards.\nfind / -iname '*fsck*'\n\nYou are correct that sudo is required. It was \"hanging\" because it needs to traverse your entire file system, which takes a long time. Alternatively, I'd recommend using locate, which uses a pre-compiled index, and is hence much quicker. This index is usually updated regularly by a cronjob, but you can ensure that it is up to date with\nsudo updatedb\n\nThen you can search for your file with\nsudo locate fsck\n\n", "Q: Lampp apache does not restart After setting up my virtual host, I restarted my lampp server with \nsudo /opt/lampp/lampp\n\nand I noticed Apache was not restarting.\n$ sudo /opt/lampp/lampp  restart\nRestarting XAMPP for Linux 5.6.3-0...\nXAMPP: Stopping Apache...fail.\napachectl returned 1.\nXAMPP: Stopping MySQL...ok.\nXAMPP: Starting Apache...already running.\nXAMPP: Starting MySQL...ok.\n\nand my virtual host domain is not working.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: My bad I forgot to remove dummy virtual hosts from httpd-vhosts.config, which was throwing the error because DocumentRoot is not a directory in dummy virtual hosts.\nI noticed the error in manager-linux-x64.run's console tab.\nIt's restarting and my virtual hosts running fine.\n", "Q: Making an exact copy of a drive with 14.10 on it to a larger drive I am currently running out of an 8GB SD Card, I need to copy the drive to a 16GB SD Card.\ndd from my research clones the partitions and the boot sector, etc.\nThe 8GB drive is encrypted, how do I cater for this and the drive being cloned / copied is in use, how do I deal with that so that any copy is exact and is their a verify setting?.\nSo far, the disk util says:\n\nExt2 (version 1.0) — Mounted at /boot\n\nThe /boot contains /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 and s/dev/da5 and another partition /dev/mapper/sda5_crypt\nI want it cloned to the 16GB SD Card which will need to be formatted as its W95 type fat table, states its read only, not sure why that is as it is definitely writable as it was in my camera up to a week ago.\nCurrently I have the following command:\n\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sda conv=noerror,sync\n\nAm I right that this will copy the entire disk with the sda2 et al partitions over to the drive that a fresh sda will be created?\n** EDIT ** \nPROBLEM SOLVED\nJust to let you know, the HDD died today, its not even spinning and made a god awful squeal, rebooted to find I can't enter BIOS until the HDD has been detected, Nice one AMI, way to go with that kind of programming...\n\nA: \nCurrently I have this command:-\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sda conv=noerror,sync\nAm I right that this will copy the entire disk with the sda2 et al partitions over to the drive that a fresh sda will be created?\n\nNotice that you have a typo in your command. Output file should be the target drive, i.e. most likely sdb. Check which is the source drive and which is the target drive carefully before doing anything! If sda=source drive and sdb=target drive, the command would be:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb conv=noerror,sync\n\nand, to answer your question, yes. But keep in mind that conv=noerror,sync will force bad blocks (if present) to be copied without any warning.\n\nThe 8GB drive is encrypted, how do I cater for this and the drive being cloned / copied is in use, how do I deal with that so that any copy is exact and is their a verify setting?\n\nNo problems in regard to the encryption, but absolutely don't clone the drive while it's in use.\nBoot from a live CD/DVD and do everything from there. Once done you can compare the drives using cmp; first of all you'll need to know the size of your first drive in byte. You can use fdisk to do this: in a terminal:\nfdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nThen:\ncmp -n <size_of_sda_in_bytes> /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n\nwhere <size_of_sda_in_bytes> is the size the first drive in byte.\nIf there's no output, the drives match up to byte <size_of_sda_in_bytes>, i.e. the whole procedure succeded\n", "Q: LibreOffice Writer edited document is recognized as virus or spyware I got MS word document, person asked me to edit it, to add table of contents, to add page numbers, because she doesn't know how to do in MS Office.

What should I do? I need this font...\nEDITED: So I turned off this blockage on firefox and I can download file and open it, haven't tried to open it in MS office yet, so not sure if it will work if something really wrong what libre does with MS fonts...\nUPDATE: well... everything works in MS Office, nothing bad happened with fonts or document when I opened it. So everything works, but still, browser treats it as virus or spyware. :) I guess LibreOffice guys should know that...\n\nA: That's probably a false positive.

I want to change the default python interpreter from python 2.7 to 3.4.0 which is installed by default.\nWhen I do:\n/home/ubuntu$ which python\n/usr/bin/python\n\nlooking in /usr/bin/ I see:\n\nSo obviously it's there. How do I set this as default?\n\nA: There would be multiple ways of doing this. First, change the sym-links around so that the python in /usr/bin/ would actually be pointing to the same location as the /usr/bin/python3 sym-link. However, this is a bad idea (as I explain below).\nThe second option would be to create a user-specific command alias - this is definitel the better option of the two.\n\nChanging Sym-links is bad\nPython is used throughout much of Ubuntu for system scripts and software, and software relies on having Python (and the commands to start Python) in a certain spot.\nSee here (Ubuntu Wiki - rather outdated) and here (Debian Wiki) for more information as to what Ubuntu/Debian use Python for.\nNow, while Python 3 (3.4.0 in your case) is the newest and the suggested version of Python, there's still a lot of code still out there that hasn't been ported to Python 3.\nBy default, as you've seen, running python runs the Python 2.7 interpreter - and that's what the software on your computer is going to expect.\nSo, if you change the command to run Python 3, you're going to cause all sorts of havoc and code breakage because you'll be trying to run Python 2.7 code (which is written in Python 2.7 syntax and uses Python 2.7 libraries) using the Python 3.4 interpreter (which expects Python 3.4 syntax and Python 3.4 libraries.)\n\nSafer, alias-creating method\nHowever, what you can do, is create an alias for your personal use. This can be accomplished easily by adding the following line:\nalias python=python3\n\nor\nalias python=/usr/bin/python3\n\n/in the ~/.bash_aliases file - which you can edit via sudo nano ~/.bash_aliases. Then, close and reopen the terminal and you should be able to use the python command for your own personal use without it affecting the rest of the system.\nHowever, this, again, isn't suggested because although you won't break any of the system-wide code that relies on proper placement of Python interpreters, I've heard it can cause other issues (that I don't know/remember.)\n\nProper method that doesn't require changing the Python interpreter at all\nIf you're writing syntax-correct Python, you should include what is known as a Shebang. (See also here, and here.)\nIf included properly, this would allow you to run a Python script simply via ./SCRIPT-NAME.py after making the script executable via sudo chmod +x ./SCRIPT-NAME.py. You could also totally forgo having the .py file type and just type the code into an empty file and save it as SCRIPT-NAME and then run sudo chmod +x ./SCRIPT-NAME and run it via ./SCRIPT-NAME.\nGranted, this does take a bit more work - but it will make sure that your code is executed using the correct interpreter.\nAnd, really. How hard is it to type python3 to run the code correctly? I'm not trying to be mean, and I can kinda see why you would want to do this, but it isn't that hard just to run python3 instead of python.\n", "Q: ARGH udev won't stop renaming my interfaces!

It will cost you a few $/month though. If this is an option search the net for \"VPN servers\". Don't be tempted to use a free VPN, DNS is way too important to depend on an unreliable and slow free VPN.\nUpdate\nYes, the connection to the VPN could be slow and/or disrupted at times. You have to balance that against the slow/disrupted connection to the DNS server provided by your ISP. Sorry, can't tell you which solution would be worse, you will have to figure it out yourself.\n\"if a DNS caching server was set up on the VPN, could i set up another caching server on my local LAN which took it's updates from the VPN's DNS cache?\" - yes, that is pretty much what I would do. Note that you have no control over what DNS server is set up at the VPN server but this can be part of your selection criteria for VPN providers.\n\nA: Since the OP mentioned he needs a gateway to shovel a LAN worth of computers, then, I suggest setting up a Squid Proxy in place and have it forward traffic to a hosted box in a more liberal country. A web proxy with a good amount of cache and local dns server is needed because high volume of traffic from your said IP to an IP geolocated in another state would attract suspicions, which would follow with banning said IP. Because of this, you need to have a local copy of a \"good chunk of the free internet\".\nSince you do not need said hosted server for anything other than a gateway, then you could try a cheap host here.. http://www.spotvps.com/\nOr, since IPv6 is not the norm yet for end user deployments, there's a high chance your \nIPS will not monitor that side of the fence, then you could sign up for a free IPv6 on IPv4 tunnel and dns resolver, from here https://ipv6.he.net/\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You could first try to see if any DNS servers on this list are banned:\nhttp://en.flossmanuals.net/bypassing-censorship/ch033_playing-with-dns/\n\n*Another solution would be to download and install Tor, which will encrypt all internet traffic. \n\n*Other solution is to use a browser, such as firefox and set it up to use proxy server with DNS forwards over socks5 from this list:\nhttp://www.socks-proxy.net/\n\nA: As sмurf wrote VPN and a DNS resolver on a virtual server in a more free country can be a good solution. I use OpenVPN for virtual private networking and Dnsmasq as a local resolver, as an internal authoritative server and as a DNS relay. DNS traffic goes through VPN is various directions. My experience with this setup is very positive. OpenVPN does not make the connection less reliable, actually the opposite is true. If the connection fails OpenVPN holds back the network packets until the connection is established again. Network programs don't notice anything even if the IP address of a road warrior changes. This does not really help DNS though, because of the short timeouts typically used in DNS. Anyway, here is the configuration I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*virtual server in a foreign country. Install OpenVPN on it. Regarding DNS you have more options, you can choose which is the most\nsimple for you:\n\n*\n\n*Use the virtual server as a router. You have to switch on forwarding in the kernel, nothing else and add firewall rules to prevent non-DNS traffic.\n\n*Instead of renting a virtual server and setting up OpenVPN on it, I guess you can simply subscribe for a VPN service which uses OpenVPN, the result will be the same as in the previous option.\n\n*Install Dnsmasq. Dnsmasq will act as a relay to the DNS resolvers provided by the hosting company.\n\n*Install a full Bind resolver. You should choose this if you do not trust in the DNS resolvers of the hosting company. I have not tried this myself, but AFAIK it is simple.\n\n\n*VPN server in your local internal network. Install OpenVPN on this server and setup the most simple point-to-point connection to the remote rented VPN. This will be a router, so enable forwarding here too.\n\n*Caching DNS server in your local network.  Install Dnsmasq here, it will be a caching DNS relay. Configure it to relay DNS requests to the DNS server(s) on the other end of the VPN. You have to setup a route here (ip route add ...), so packets sent to the remote DNS goes through your local VPN server.\n\n\nThe default configuration of Dnsmasq only allows 150 cache entry, you have to increase that for 60 users. Dnsmasq is designed for small networks, but they consider 60 users as a small network. It has the advantage that your configuration will be about two lines.\nYou can use a single server for the local DnsMasq and the local VPN server, if you want.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to internet through DAP-1650 Problem\nI cannot connect to the Internet when connected to my DLink Wireless AC1200 Access Point DAP-1650 via Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr LTS.

But, the AR file size is showing the exact as it was during the compression.\nCould anyone please help me to decompress the AR file properly?\nThanks.\n\nA: You are looking for the ar command. It is installed on any Ubuntu version.\nWikipedia:\n\nThe archiver, also known simply as ar, is a Unix utility that maintains groups of files as a single archive file. Today, ar is generally used only to create and update static library files that the link editor or linker uses; it can be used to create archives for any purpose, but has been largely replaced by tar for purposes other than static libraries. An implementation of ar is included as one of the GNU Binutils.\nIn the Linux Standard Base, ar has been deprecated and is expected to disappear in a future release of that Standard. The rationale provided was that \"the LSB does not include software development utilities nor does it specify .o and .a file formats.\"\n\n\nTo list contents:\nar -t\n\n\n-t option of the gnu archiver (ar) writes a table of contents of archive to the standard output. Only the files specified by the file operands shall be included in the written list. If no file operands are specified, all files in archive shall be included in the order of the archive.\n\n\nAnd all of the options from the \"usage\" when you just type \"ar\":\n~$ ar\nUsage: ar [emulation options] [-]{dmpqrstx}[abcDfilMNoPsSTuvV] [--plugin <name>] [member-name] [count] archive-file file...\n       ar -M [<mri-script]\n commands:\n  d            - delete file(s) from the archive\n  m[ab]        - move file(s) in the archive\n  p            - print file(s) found in the archive\n  q[f]         - quick append file(s) to the archive\n  r[ab][f][u]  - replace existing or insert new file(s) into the archive\n  s            - act as ranlib\n  t            - display contents of archive\n  x[o]         - extract file(s) from the archive\n command specific modifiers:\n  [a]          - put file(s) after [member-name]\n  [b]          - put file(s) before [member-name] (same as [i])\n  [D]          - use zero for timestamps and uids/gids\n  [U]          - use actual timestamps and uids/gids (default)\n  [N]          -

I have previously, using the same ISO's and unetbootin been able to install Kubuntu, linux mint, ubuntu gnome. I'm using a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 series laptop. After buying it, I went through the process of changing UEFI boot settings to install a dual boot with kubuntu. Eventually I just deleted the windows partition and reincorporated it into the linux. However, I'm now taking a class about programming in C#, and require Visual studios, hence I re-installed a dual boot with windows 8.1. At this point Bios is in legacy mode when I installed it. I was following another post here on ubuntu stack exchange about installing windows after linux, then using a linux liveusb to fix grub. After installing windows however, I can now not install linux from usb at all. Windows will install from usb, but when a linux drive is in, it will boot past bios, but won't detect anything. I've wiped the hard drive completely, and reset the BIOS to UEFI boot mode, but it still detects ubuntu in the UEFI boot order.\nAs it stands, I have a completely fresh hard drive with no OS at all (having to use windows usb install to format HDD). Install from USB will work with windows when in legacy mode, but not when in UEFI. Linux won't work in either UEFI or legacy mode.

I've searched the internet and I can't find a simple guide how to animate ui objects in Ubuntu SDK.\nCan someone please explain the different parts needed and how they work together?\n\nA: QtQuick offers a rich set of transition and animation libraries that you can find here. It basically involves changing the properties of an object with the specified time interval.\nHere is a code sample to animate a rectangular block to move side ways.\n     Rectangle {\n        id: rect\n        color: \"Green\"\n        width: units.gu(20)\n        height: width\n        x: units.gu(0)\n        y: units.gu(0)\n\n        MouseArea {\n            anchors.fill: parent\n            onClicked: rectAnimation.start()\n        }\n\n        NumberAnimation {\n            id: rectAnimation\n            target: rect\n            property: \"y\"\n            from: units.gu(0)\n            to: units.gu(20)\n            duration: 500\n        }\n    }\n\nYou can trigger animations based on various things like object states, behaviour etc...For instance, if you want the rectangle to increase its size in a fluid manner, you would define the following behavior,\nBehavior on width {\n    NumberAnimation { duration: 500 }\n}\n\nQtQuick is infinitely powerful. I would highly recommend going through the official Qt documentation to find out the different types of animations available and their triggers.\nNote: While developing applications for Ubuntu Touch requires the Ubuntu SDK, it is worth knowing that the Ubuntu SDK itself uses Qt and hence you would get more results if you searched for QML solutions rather than Ubuntu SDK solutions in the future.\n", "Q: Extend /dev/sdb1 without unmounting? There seems to be about a million web pages about extending the system partition of your Ubuntu installation, and how you need to do a lot of steps to extend your disk. But nothing about increasing the size of a secondary volume.\nI have a production web server running Ubuntu 14.04.\nI've added an extra disk, 40GB in size, and moved, mounted and fstab'ed /var to it.\nIt all works as intended.\nHowever, now I've added 60gb more disk to it in VMWare, and I can't do umount on the disk, since it's busy.\nIs it really no way to increase the disk size without interupting the web server?\nEven Windows Server 2003 can achieve this.\nThanks! \n\nA: You can only extend / resize the physical partition if the file system is unmounted.\nThe only exception is if you use LVM. If you use LVM you would first add or extend the physical volume, then extend the logical volume, then extend the file system.\nWith LVM, adding a new physical partition, sdb1 in this example.\nFirst make a partition on /dev/sdb, either with fdisk, parted, or gparted\nThen make a file system:\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1\n\nAdd the partition to the (LVM) physical volume,  VolGroup00 in this example\npvcreate /dev/sdb1\nvgextend VolGroup00 /dev/sdb1\n\nExtend the logical volume , LogVol00 in this example \nlvextend -L +10G /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00\n\nResize the filesystem . I know this works for ext3 and ext4. It will not work with ext2. I am not sure about other file systems\nresize2fs /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00\n\nAdjust your /dev/sdb1 volume groups, and partition to your server.\nIf you are NOT using LVM, you are out of luck and will have to manage your partitions with a live .iso\n\nA: For anyone searching on how to this with a CloudAtCost provider the below is what worked for me: \npvscan && vgextend localhost-vg /dev/sda3 && lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/localhost-vg/root && resize2fs /dev/localhost-vg/root\n\n", "Q: Can't install vim-gnome On the last Ubunt 14.04 upgrade I'm not able to install vim-gnome anymore due the following error:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:  vim-gnome : Depends:\nvim-gui-common (= 2:7.4.640-1~ppa1~t) but it is not going to be\ninstalled E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken\npackages.\n\nTried to remove absolutely everything related to vim and reinstall, but no success.\n\nA: It appears that pi-rho's PPA has a broken build of Vim.

The easiest way to get things back to normal would be to uninstall IPython and then reinstall IPython from the Ubuntu repositories. You can find IPython in Ubuntu Software or reference it by its package name ipython.\nBy now IPython 2.x has become less useful, and it's time to consider installing IPython 3.x with the following command:\nsudo apt install python3-ipython\n\n\nA: This happened to me after an update. The problem was that there were two versions of ipython which were clashing, one was version 0.13.2 that I had installed using synaptic, and the other was version 3.1.0, which I had installed from the source.\nIn my /usr/local/bin/ipython, I had the following code:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# This script was automatically generated by setup.py\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    from IPython import start_ipython\n    start_ipython()\n\nFrom what I gathered from http://nullege.com/codes/search/IPython.start_ipython, it seems that start_ipython has been implemented in recent versions of ipython, but for some reason, when I was importing IPython in the python shell, it was version 0.13.2 which was being imported. This didn't have a start_ipython function, hence it raised an ImportError.\nNow that I have removed the old version of ipython, the new version works fine.\n", "Q: Google account integration like in Fedora 21 In Fedora 21 there is a great google account integration available (mail, calendar), which works with OAuth2 integration.

If so where would I make this change.\n\nA: The answer to your question is here How can I make fsck run non-interactively at boot time?\nTo force ubuntu to fix all disk errors at boot you need to add FSCKFIX=yes to the file /etc/default/rcS.

In that case you are better of with a find  and -print0 loop, see this answer for an example and this write-up for details.\nEdit\nAs noted by muru, the whitespace problem may not be as problematic as it used to be, YMMV.\n\nA: What you call a table is usually called an array or a map. In bash, to create such an array:\npath=\"/home/user/Documents\"\nsuffix=\"_suffix.txt\"\nfiles=( \"$path\"/*\"$suffix\" )\n\nThe * is a wildcard, which is expanded by the shell to all matching filenames (that have $path before it and $suffix after). The brackets (()) convert the expanded filenames into an array.\nThen you can access each element (indexed from 0, instead of 1) using \"${files[0]}\", \"${files[1]}\", etc.\nFor example:\n$ path=/tmp\n$ suffix=_amd64.deb\n$ files=( \"$path\"/*\"$suffix\" )\n$ echo \"${files[1]}\" \"${files[0]}\" \n/tmp/vim-athena_7.4.640-1~ppa1~t_amd64.deb /tmp/vim_7.4.640-1~ppa1~t_amd64.deb\n\n", "Q: Why can't I update my Ubuntu?

To dig a little deeper, you'll want a quality audio codec to mux that video with, that is also playable on most devices, which is the Advanced Audio Codec (AAC).  \nThe main 'knock' against this solution is it contains lots of patented technology.  However, depending on your users, needs and ability to license legally, a H264/AAC/MP4 solution \"shouldn't\" be a problem.\nAnother point is that this will not work for live video.  The best format for DESKTOP live streaming is still FLV (Flash Video with RTMP plugin on the player) and for mobile, HLS.\nOf course, there are dozens of other formats for on-demand playback (WEBM, Theora) and live streaming (e.g. DASH) but you will run into major limits as to which devices can play them (if any).\n\nA: I am not an expert on the subject, but I will try to help you.

I know how to find \"lemon\"  or \"rice\"  but not the two of them. They don't need to be next to the other, just one the same line of text.\n\nA: \"Both on the same line\" means \"'rice' followed by random characters followed by 'lemon' or the other way around\". \nIn regex that is rice.*lemon or lemon.*rice. You can combine that using a |:\ngrep -E 'rice.*lemon|lemon.*rice' some_file\n\nIf you want to use normal regex instead of extended ones (-E) you need a backslash before the |: \ngrep 'rice.*lemon\\|lemon.*rice' some_file\n\nFor more words that quickly gets a bit lengthy and it's usually easier to use multiple calls of grep, for example:\ngrep rice some_file | grep lemon | grep chicken\n\n\nA: You can pipe the output of first grep command to another grep command and that would match both the patterns. So, you can do something like:\ngrep <first_pattern> <file_name> | grep <second_pattern>\n\nor,\ncat <file_name> | grep <first_pattern> | grep <second_pattern>\n\nExample:\nLet's add some contents to our file:\n$ echo \"This line contains lemon.\" > test_grep.txt\n$ echo \"This line contains rice.\" >> test_grep.txt\n$ echo \"This line contains both lemon and rice.\" >> test_grep.txt\n$ echo \"This line doesn't contain any of them.\" >> test_grep.txt\n$ echo \"This line also contains both rice and lemon.\" >> test_grep.txt\n\nWhat does the file contain:\n$ cat test_grep.txt \nThis line contains lemon.\nThis line contains rice.\nThis line contains both lemon and rice.\nThis line doesn't contain any of them.\nThis line also contains both rice and lemon.\n\nNow, let's grep what we want:\n$ grep rice test_grep.txt | grep lemon\nThis line contains both lemon and rice.\nThis line also contains both rice and lemon.\n\nWe only get the lines where both the patterns match. You can extend this and pipe the output to another grep command for further \"AND\" matches.\n\nA: Though the question asks for 'grep', I thought it might be helpful to post a simple 'awk' solution:\nawk '/lemon/ && /rice/'\n\nThis can easily be extended with more words, or other boolean expressions besides 'and'.\n\nA: Another idea to finding the matches in any order is using:\ngrep with -P (Perl-Compatibility) option and positive lookahead regex (?=(regex)):\ngrep -P '(?=.*?lemon)(?=.*?rice)' infile\n\nor you can use below, instead:\ngrep -P '(?=.*?rice)(?=.*?lemon)' infile\n\n\n*\n\n*The .*? means matching any characters . that occurrences zero or more times * while they are optional followed by a pattern(rice or lemon). The ? makes everything optional before it (means zero or one time of everything matched .*)\n\n(?=pattern): Positive Lookahead: The positive lookahead construct is a pair of parentheses, with the opening parenthesis followed by a question mark and an equals sign.\nSo this will return all lines with contains both lemon and rice in random order. Also this will avoid of using |s and doubled greps.\n\nExternal links:\n\nAdvanced Grep Topics \nPositive Lookahead – GREP for Designers\n\n\nA: This command returns matches for a line which has either foo or goo.\ngrep -e foo -e goo\n\nThis command return matches for lines which have both foo and goo in any order.\ngrep -e foo.*goo -e goo.*foo\n\n\nA: If we admit that providing an answer that is not grep based is acceptable, like the above answer based on awk, I would propose a simple perl line like:\n$ perl -ne 'print if /lemon/ and /rice/' my_text_file\n\nThe search can be ignoring case with some/all of the words like /lemon/i and /rice/i.\nOn most Unix/Linux machines perl is installed as well as awk anyway.\n\nA: Here's a script to automate the grep piping solution:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Use filename if provided as environment variable, or \"foo\" as default\nfilename=${filename-foo}\n\ngrepand () {\n# disable word splitting and globbing\nIFS=\nset -f\nif [[ -n $1 ]]\nthen\ngrep -i \"$1\" ${filename} | filename=\"\" grepand \"${@:2}\"\nelse\n# If there are no arguments, assume last command in pipe and print everything\ncat\nfi\n}\n\ngrepand \"$@\"\n\n", "Q: Migrate root filesystem from btrfs to ext4 I want migrate a Ubuntu installation off of btrfs as root because it frequently hangs and causes out of space errors and I really don't need the snapshots. The partition was created empty and not migrated so btrfs convert -r is not an option. The solution is probably to rsync the contents to another ext4 partition, but I never got that to boot (probably because of Grub/fstab/...). What do you need to move from btrfs to ext4 as root partition?\n\nA: You can rsync the files to another, but it won't boot (as you've observed). However, it's not difficult to set the new drive to boot after you've copied the files. The exact method depends on which boot loader you want (grub, gummi, etc.), how you've configured your partitions (do you have a separate /boot partition?), if you're using partition tables or GPT, and if you're using EFI or MBR.\nThat's too many variables for me to cover, but you can find instructions online if you search. The Arch wiki pages tend to cover this in great detail, for example.\nIn case you're unsure, I suggest you choose GPT, EFI, no separate /boot partition, and gummi. If your system is old enough it may not support those choices.\n", "Q: Odd errors in bleach bit When running Ubuntu and bleachbit as root I get this error:\n[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/root/tmpLANpUQsZBUBAmqq-fQMbArbaj3QQbm1s03_Vax9iq6QHSa_cwHoLDBhJpdcRlq6dfF_X.FowA7_Sjw_R-hOVtTTK2iU5tLf3v34JYnyKbH0Y9Sg47eJ59CqZWQrcRKqFF-8x.jbPadCA2Ysr4Zlsa0Lbptstt28YKN2ZW_ohfIKloVM.Hy8fRZgPfAf2PiXodV5ajWME54 Lmxjied64gjyjt5oanmtZA13fRSQBro3-bUhKsipGsUeZkX'\n\nProbably the gov as I've been inventing some pretty radical anti big brother systems or maybe just paranoia lol - what do you think?\n\nA: This looks like a temporary file related to the \"clean free disk space\" option.

To install with a disc, the proper way to do it is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu from:\nUbuntu Download Page\n\n*After downloading Ubuntu then you need to burn an ISO image onto a DVD.

We have found that if power is lost during boot then at next boot the boot sequence waits for a keyboard entry at the Grub screen. Of course if there is no keyboard the the machine will not get past that point. Any ideas how to get around this?\n\nA: Making an industrial machine fault tolerant is more then just tweaking some software settings: it's a combination of both hardware and software.\nIf frequent power failures are to be expected in the environment the machine will be operating in, a small UPS (preferably built into the power supply) will be needed. (5 minute autonomy would be sufficient for 95% of the cases I've ever met) \nThis will allow you to install a UPS daemon that will allow the machine to recover gracefully from:\n\n\n*\n\n*Relatively small power surges. (red-out)\n\n*Continue to provide power during power sags. (brown-out)\n\n*Smooth out noisy power sources/consumers. (Red-brown-out)\n\n*Provide power for some time during a black-out.\n\n\nAnd depending on your use case, dust-proofing, water-proofing, gas-proofing, heat-proofing and/or radiation-proofing might be advisable as well or your equipment will die at or about ½ to ¼ of its MTBF.\nAnd waiting for a keyboard must be disabled both in the BIOS and in /etc/default/grub The parameter is. \n\nA: In order to disable waiting for key press in grub you will have to edit grub file located at /etc/default. Thus once you will have to use keyboard for changing settings.\nOpen Terminal and enter following command\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n(Edit /etc/default/grub and change the values of following parameters as :)\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=5\n\nSave the file.\nThen execute\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Can there be two init processes?

I'm reinstalling Ubuntu, and want to do full disk encryption. After selecting it, I'm given a choice to also encrypt the Home folder.\nSince Ubuntu doesn't use a separate partition for the Home folder (afaik), wouldn't full disk encryption already cover the Home folder? Does adding Home folder encryption add more security of some kind?\n\nA: If you're using the guided full disk encryption you're home partition will be part of the encrypted LVM and thus you're right it is already covered by that.\nI think it will add hardly any security but complexity if you still encode you're homefolder. (transparent encode within block level encode)\nA possible usecase might be that you share the machine with other users (who know the disk-passphrase) and you want your data inaccessible by them.\nSo I basically just aggree with your guesses :]\n\nA: I think that option covers the case in which you choose to put the home folder in another drive/partition. Notice how you can set different mount points in different drives/partitions when you choose \"Something else\" during the \"Installation type\" step of the installation process:\n\nThis is the only picture i could found, it's from an old distribution, but the same still applies to the latest releases\n\nA: 18.04 Update\nOnly Full Disk Encryption is standard with 18.04, Home encryption is gone from the installer.\nAfter making a fully encrypted installation to USB I examined the results with both Disks and GParted.\n\n\n\nThe encrypted extended partition was fully encrypted. Swap is a file within this partition, (and not a partition on its own), and is also encrypted.\nHome is a directory within the encrypted partition and thus is also encrypted.\nThe Boot partition is not encrypted. The disk must first be booted before it can be decrypted.\n\nA: \"It depends\".\nWhole disk encryption will use LUKS and everything but /boot will be encrypted, including your data in /home.\nThis prevents unauthorized access to the system from a cold boot. Once the system is fully booted, however, everything, including /home, is decrypted.\nEncrypting /home uses ecryptfs and your home directory will be encrypted when you are not logged in. This prevents root or other uses from accessing your data in /home. Your data, however, is decrypted as long as you are logged in.\n\nA: 21.04 update\nI passed by this question while I was looking for an answer for the same probleme.

Let's try again:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo modprobe wl\n\nIf you haven't any other network connection available, you may follow this process to get the files from the install USB: Unable to connect to any Wifi in Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: I know this question is pretty old, but here's what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the current STA driver from Broadcom's website at http://www.broadcom.com/support/?gid=1. Create a new folder and move the downloaded file into it, then cd into the folder. Expannd with tar xvf <filename>.\n\n*Unload the current STA driver by running sudo modprobe -r wl.\n\n*Remove the current driver's package with sudo apt-get remove bcmwl-kernel-source.\n\n*Install the new driver by running make && sudo make install.\n\n*Load the new driver with sudo modprobe wl.\n\n\nA: I'm on 18.04.2 Cinnamon 4.0.6, Thinkpad T420 BCM4352.  This thread still appears relevant since some people like me have old hardware.\nI installed via:\n#  apt install broadcom-sta-dkms\n\nWatched it build the firmware into initrd file in /boot partition, rebooted, and voila.  WiFi active, was able to join an SSID listed in Network-Manager right away.\nCouldn't have been easier.\n\nA: Had the same problem with Ubuntu 18.04 on Dell XPS 13 9343, where the wireless adapter recently stopped working after an upgrade. The proprietary driver (bcmwl-kernel-source, which is the only one that supports BCM4352 802.11ac) would not load:\n$ sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb wl brcmfmac brcmsmac bcma\n$ sudo modprobe wl\nmodprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'wl': Required key not available\n\nAs it turned out, you need to switch off Secure Boot in order to activate this (updated) driver. The easiest way to do that is installing shim-signed and following the required steps:\nsudo apt install shim-signed\n\nIf it's already installed you can use the following to enroll a new MOK:\nsudo update-secureboot-policy --new-key\n\nAfter a reboot the adapter is working again.\n", "Q: MAAS Network and NAT Here is the case:\n\n\n1) I have a public network connected to internet LAN #1\n\n2) I have another private network for MAAS and its DHCP and DNS , LAN #2\n\n3) For internet connection i need to enable NAT\n\nQuestion:\n\n1) Do I need a Managed Switch to enable NAT on admin page of Switch on my private Network?\n\n2) In which LAN , LAN #1 or LAN #2 , I must define and Enable NAT?\n\n3) Does the enabling of NAT is something defined in Switch?\n\nThnaks\n\nA: *\n\n*No, you need a router. You should define NAT rules in the admin page or in the configuration file of the router. On many routers, outbound NAT is automatically defined which will give devices on the LAN side automatic access to the Internet via 1 public address.\n\n*If your goal is to provide NAT'd Internet access to the the nodes and MAAS controller on the MAAS/DHCP/DNS LAN #2 network, you will need a router between LAN 2 and your network with public Internet IP addresses. The router's WAN interface would get a public Internet IP (NAT outside in Cisco land) and the router's LAN interface would get a private IP (NAT inside in Cisco land) and that private IP would be the Internet gateway address for your MAAS controller and it's nodes.\n\n*No, switches do not normally handle NAT. \n\n\nFrom: http://www.iana.org/glossary\nnetwork address translation (NAT)\nA system of using private IP addresses within an internal network (such as within a home, and office, or even within an ISP), and then having those numbers converted into a real IP address when Internet traffic leaves that network using a specialised router. This is commonly used within homes, for example, so that users do not have to apply for an extra IP address each time they connect a device to the network. It is very similar to using “extension numbers” within an office telephone system\nFrom: \n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/26704-nat-faq-00.html\n\n\nQ. How does NAT work?\nA. Basically, NAT allows a single device, such as a router, to act as an agent between the Internet (or public network) and a local network (or private network), which means that only a single unique IP address is required to represent an entire group of computers to anything outside their network.\nQ. How do I configure NAT?\nA. In order to configure traditional NAT, you need to make at least one interface on a router (NAT outside) and another interface on the router (NAT inside) and a set of rules for translating the IP addresses in the packet headers (and payloads if desired) need to be configured. In order to configure Nat Virtual Interface (NVI), you need at least one interface configured with NAT enable along with the same set of rules as mentioned above.\n(EDIT:)\nUpon further review, it seems your network needs are similar to the scenario listed at: http wiki dot cloudbase dot it/maas (I need at least 10 reputation to post more than 2 links)\nThat means you would need to make your Ubuntu MAAS server act as your router/firewall between it's two interfaces to allow the machines attached to the private network interface (your LAN #2) to access the Internet via the public interface (your LAN  #1): \nFrom: http://wiki.cloudbase.it/maas\nConfigure firewall and enable ip forwarding\n/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT\necho 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf\nsysctl -p\n\n", "Q: How to properly install Ubuntu to an Aspire E5 laptop? I have an Acer Aspire E5-551G-83LH laptop with the following specification:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD Quad-Core Processor A8-7100 (that is an APU)\n\n*AMD Radeon R7 M265 with 2 GB Dedicated VRAM\n\n*4 GB DDR3 L Memory\n\n\nI installed Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit). What I have done already:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed fglrx from the Software Center that solved display/resolution problems.\n\n*Installed a kernel update that fixed the touchpad, so I can move the cursor and click now.\n\n*I tried to install a fresh driver (fglrx) from AMD website but it fails during installation. \n\n\nI still have the following problems that are really serious ones for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Battery time is about 3-4 hours when I just run a browser with one tab and even in idle. Benchmarks tell me that I should have 9-10 but at least 7 hours.\n\n*In system settings Ubuntu see only 3 BiB RAM.\n\n*For graphics it tells me that I have \"KV SPECTRE SL MOBILE 19W (1318)\". What is this?\n\n*When I turn on the laptop I get error messages before Ubuntu starts to load, and during shutdown the Ubuntu logout screen becomes noisy. I smell GPU driver problems here.\n\n*Every few minutes the display makes a tiny blink.\n\n\nI'm really surprised about all these problems. Usually I just install Ubuntu and have nothing to configure. Does Ubuntu have problems with Acer or AMD products?\n\nA: So I was able to solve most of the problems by the following ultimate solution:\nInstall Ubuntu 15.04 or later\nLooks like that the touchpad and graphics problems are all solved by simply installing a newer version. The system still only see 3 GiB and the battery life seems to be a bit worse then what Windows offers but other than that, everything works fine.\n", "Q: How to resolve Link Local hosts without typing .local So in windows, if I typed ping familyroom, it would tell me that my PC in the family room is 192.168.1.61. (DHCP assigned address that isn't in any DNS)\nI'm running a new install of Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr LTS, and if I try to ping familyroom, I get unknown host.  But, if I try to ping familyroom.local, I get a successfully response from that same IP address.\nnow I realize that I can just use the FQDN including the .local domain, but I'm lazy, and I'm trying to get Ubuntu 14.04 to work as well as Windows 7 did for me, and this is just one more nit-picky thing that irks me.\nAs a test, I added a search local to a new /etc/resolvconf/resolve.conf.d/tail file and resolvconf -u, but I get the same result. I assume this is due to \"zeroconf\" doing the name resolution for .local, but I don't know where to go from here to fix.\n\nEDIT: Based on the help from @heemal, I now realize that Link Local resolution comes from Avahi, so I am focused on trying to get the Avahi name resolution to look up short-named hosts, or find an alternative to Avahi.\nIn the /etc/nsswitch.conf file, I attempted to add the full MDNS functionality of Avahi for DNS not found addresses.\nOriginal hosts definition: `hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns`\nUnchanged results using: `hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4`\n\nNow in Windows, I see that this Link Local resolution is coming via IPv6, and I wonder if there are improvements in the specification for IPv6 that could help me out here.\n\nA: If you add something on /etc/resolvconf/resolve.conf.d/{head, base, tail} then the name resolution will be carried out by resolvconf, not by avahi-daemon hence just adding search local is not resolving the name. \nTo get the search domain working you need to set up a DNS server that will give response to your queries after the domain name being appended properly by your system.\nAnother option would be to add the entries in your /etc/hosts file like:\nfamilyroom    192.168.1.4\n\nNow if you ping familyroom you will get the response.\nBy far the laziest option would be to add an alias like this:\nalias familyroom='ping familyroom.local'\nin the ~/.bashrc file. Now source ~/.bashrc and you can just type familyroom to send the ICMP echo request to the device.\n", "Q: Switching text editors to get better stuff I am not sure I am entirely happy with leafpad as a text editor on my Lubuntu box.\nQuestion: Could I just purge leafpad from the system and install gedit instead?\nSeems to me that gedit won't have any real issues with this being done, but I need to ask the experts on this one.\n\nA: Running the following will remove leafpad along with all its configuration files and then install gedit:\nsudo apt-get purge leafpad && sudo apt-get install gedit\n\nYou can use any text editor you like, gedit(or any other) won't have any issues regarding that.\n", "Q: Process [#] terminated with status [#] What is \"process [number in parentheses] terminated with status 1\"?  or \"with status 99\"?\nI forget exactly where it appeared. Probably in a crash report.\n\nA: The numbers you have pointed out are referred to as exit status value of a process. If a process terminates properly then the exit status will always be 0, if it does not terminate properly then the exit status will be some number other than 0.\nYou can found the exit status of the last executed command by running the following in the terminal:\necho $?\n\nHere is an example:\n$ lsb_release -sc\ntrusty\n$ echo $?\n0\n\nThe execution was a success indicated by the value 0.\n$ lsb_releasedd\nlsb_releasedd: command not found\n$ echo $?\n127\n\nThe command was not found hence unsuccessful indicated by the value 127.\n", "Q: g77 with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I am working with a government program that was written in Fortran 77, and requires g77 to configure and compile the source code.

You can invoke Webmin to start via command-line sudo service webmin start when configured not to start at boot.\n", "Q: Revkit make.py bootstrap error username@ubuntu:~$ cd revkit-2.2\nusername@ubuntu:~/revkit-2.2$ ./make.py bootstrap\nbash: ./make.py: No such file or directory\n\nWhat does this mean and why does this happen?\n\nA: This means that there is no file named make.py within the revkit-2.2 directory.\nThese are the files and directories contained within revkit-2.2:\ntotal 56\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 norman norman 4096 Dec 22 05:28 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 norman norman 4096 Feb 26 21:43 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 norman norman 4096 Dec 22 05:28 addons\n-rw-r--r-- 1 norman norman 2740 Dec 22 05:28 CMakeLists.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 norman norman 4096 Dec 22 05:28 ext\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 norman norman 4096 Dec 22 05:28 gui\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 norman norman 4096 Dec 22 05:28 programs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 norman norman  770 Dec 22 05:28 README.md\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 norman norman 4096 Dec 22 05:28 src\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 norman norman 4096 Dec 22 05:28 test\n\nYou should read the README.md file for instructions:\n# RevKit\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following software is required in order to build RevKit\n\n* git\n* cmake (at least version 2.8.9)\n* g++ or clang++ (with C++11 support)\n* boost (at least version 1.48.0)\n* GNU MP, and its C++ interface GMP++\n* Qt5 (only for the GUI)\n\n## Build RevKit\n\nAfter cloning RevKit perform the following steps\n\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake ..\n    make\n\nTo build the GUI perform the following steps from the base directory\n\n    cd gui\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake ..\n    make\n\n## Build RevKit Addons\n\nThe easiest way to enable addons is by typing `ccmake ..' in the build directory\n\n## Executing RevKit Programs\n\nExecutables can be found in the directory `build/programs'.

I currently have Windows 7 installed on a laptop with Ubuntu 14.04 installed via Wubi. So when I boot up I have the option to load up either WIndows or Ubuntu. I am going to install just 14.04 on its own as my current (wubi) version is made up of lots of previous versions added on top of each other.\nSo I am going to back up my Home folder, put the bookable usb stick in with Ubuntu 14.04 on it and click the option to install alongside windows, during the install. \nMy question is will I need to remove the wubi version of Ubuntu, that I currently have or can I install the new Ubuntu (alongside Windows) and then remove the wubi version when I know all is OK?\n\nA: Well after a bit of time searching and a bit of help from others along the way, I decided to remove the old version and install a fresh copy. I took everything that I wanted off the wubi install and then um-installed it in Windows. I then installed the latest version via the USB and opted to install alongside Windows. It took a bit of time to get Ubuntu back to how I wanted it, but it is there now. It is true that I could keep the old wubi version there, but for me this was a good opportunity to have a fresh copy.\n", "Q: Help reverting changes to GRUB Okay, so I tried to use this fix for my blackscreen when going into tty command line\nsudo sed -i -e 's/#GRUB_TERMINAL/GRUB_TERMINAL/g' /etc/default/grub\nThis did not fix it, but I found something else that did, but now I'm no longer able to change the resolution of tty command line, it gives me limited viewable lines and text looks blurry. I can't seem to find anyone with the same issue with not benig able to change it, so I assume the prior fix I tried using is what is now causing the issue since when I log in, (I dual boot) when I choose between windows or ubuntu, the resolution became very low for that after using that command. Here's my GRUB config file:\n(had to upload a screeshot because apparently '#' make text very large?)\n\nWhat I've tried so far is uncommenting and recommenting graphical terminal. If I remove nomodeset from the GRUB_CMDLINEs it gives me a black screen. Am I unable to change resolution if I have nomodeset in those lines?\nOk, so I changed monitors, and I'm able to change Grub's resolution again, but now I'm getting black screen again when I try to enter tty 1-6...\n\nA: To revert the change run\nsudo sed -i -e 's/GRUB_TERMINAL/#GRUB_TERMINAL/g' /etc/default/grub\n\nOr when you edit /etc/default/grub, just add a # to the GRUB_TERMINAL line.\nThen run \nsudo update-grub\n\nThe reboot\nFWIW sed is a powerful command and substitues one sting for another, so all the sed command is doing is commenting out , or removing the comment (#) from the GRUB_TERMINAL option.\nexample :\necho GRUB_TERMINAL\nGRUB_TERMINAL\n\necho GRUB_TERMINAL | sed -e 's/GRUB_TERMINAL/#GRUB_TERMINAL/g' \n#GRUB_TERMINAL\n\necho GRUB_TERMINAL | sed -e 's/GRUB_TERMINAL/#GRUB_TERMINAL/g'| sed -e 's/#GRUB_TERMINAL/GRUB_TERMINAL/g\nGRUB_TERMINAL\n\nthe -i command edits the file /etc/default/grub in this case\n\nA: Comment GRUB_TERMINAL=console to #GRUB_TERMINAL=console.\nEdit GRUB_GFXMODE=1360x768 to the resolution of your monitor (it may already be the correct resolution). Update grub and reboot. If this didn't fix your problem, comment that GRUB_GFXMODE line out. You might have to sacrifice the grub menu resolution to use your tty's; I have had that problem before.\n", "Q: changing from ubuntu 12.10 to 14. First of all I am not experienced in this at all. just learning. but I have a older Lenovo think pad. it has Ubuntu 12.10. I have downloaded the 14. to a flash drive from a windows computer. but when I plug it into the Ubuntu comp, I use the startup disk creator but when I click other because nothing comes up on the top bar, I click on what is downloaded on the flash drive, and it will not do anything. its as if I did not format the flash drive correctly or something. I used the pendrivelinux download software. please help any info and tips is greatly appreciated. also if there is any books I can study and read to get a start on all this would be great too. \n\nA: Transfer the ISO that you have download, and placed on the USB stick, to the Downloads directory on the 12.10 machine.\nNow, when you open up the Startup Disk Creator from the 12.10 machine, the image (iso) will be in the top box. (Downloads is the default directory, other is for other directories) The USB stick should be in the lower box.  Erase Disk \nWhen it's done deleting everything on the stick.... Make Startup Disk and then boot the stick.\nJust like the USB stick, unless you have made other preparations all data on the 12.10 machine will be lost as well.\nWith regards to what to read; read everything.  I find a \"problem based\" strategy the best.  When you have a problem, search for a solution and encompass enough information so you know it should work or at minimum not aggravate the situation.\n", "Q: Failure installing Ubuntu 14.10 on Mac Pro cylinder: Cannot mount /dev/loop0 I'm trying to install Ubuntu on the latest version of the Mac Pro (the one that looks like a black mini trash can). \nI basically followed the instructions on Installing on a Mac Pro - Cylinder (Late 2013)\nI tried both Ubuntu 14.10 and Xubuntu 14.10. Both are 64-bit. The MD5's SUM are checked and are correct. \nI created a bootable USB drive using Universal USB Installer 1.9.5.9.\nI used the nomodeset kernel parameter. Everything went smoothly, until this:\n(initramfs) mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on //filesystem.squashfs failed: No such device\nCan not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //filesystem.squashfs\n\nI've been working on this for hours. Before that, another person tried for days. Your help will be much appreciated. \n\nA: I initially thought it is the way I created the USB drive. I switched to Rufus and it worked. But I then realized it is the USB controller within the Mac Pro. It turns out that one can only install Ubuntu from 1 of the 4 USB ports. Any other port leads to errors reading the USB key, thus the error I saw earlier. For the one success, I just happened to use the correct port. \nDue to its small form factor, this Mac Pro is super hot. This causes some issues. Some ports would work a little bit when the machine is cold, but stop working very soon.\n", "Q: Downloading Google Chrome (armhf?)

Any pointers or advice?\n\nA: Chrome doesn't support armhf systems, but the community open source Chromium does. Do a one liner sudo apt-get install chromium-browser to install Chromium, which, to the average user, is an exact replica of Google Chrome (logins and everything are supported). If you get an error after this, something saying that a dependency is missing, do sudo apt-get install -f. \nUsing raspberry pi, maybe? Full browsers tend to run slowly on raspberry pi's, but enjoy it if you can get it to run!\n\nA: Google Chrome on your architecture (armhf) is problematic because of licensing issues with ARM and bugs with ARM's proprietary drivers. See issue 457511 --https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457511\nThe Samsung ARM Chromebooks are able to operate with some complex workarounds that are beyond installation with a simple Debian package.\nIf you want to try building Chromium yourself -- see --\nhttp://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/mali-t6xx-gpu-user-space-drivers/\n\nA: You should download Vivaldi or Midori browser which are also best alternatives for linux. First of all you need to run the following command to download wget:\nsudo apt install wget\n\nAnd then you should run the following command:\nwget https://downloads.vivaldi.com/stable/vivaldi-stable_2.11.1811.47-1_armhf.deb\n\nOr to download Midori, just use this command\nsudo apt install midori\n\n\nA: Its weird to install the genuine Google Chrome, as the normal Chrome browser for Linux is the Chromium Web Browser.Available via command line and software center.\nBut for genuine Google Chrome its odd...if you do get Google Chrome you will be able to access normally limited streams such as Netflix.\nYou will need to go to https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html. I have included a link for you to click of for easy access. You will need to click the download button and select your OS type for the download.\nOnce you have finished your download you will need to go to your downloads folder and double the download for chrome.\nIt will reroute you to the software center, where you must download Google-Chrome-Stable.Once it has downloaded you now have Google Chrome, just search your dash home for it and lock it to your launcher.\n", "Q: Can not log into Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS along side Windows 7.

For example if a text file is 700 Bytes then it will show 700 bytes as the file size but e.g. in ext4 filesystem a file takes 4K space at minimum (block size) on the disk. So, ls is not showing what disk stores.\n\n*ls will show the directory entries as the block size your filesystem has (this is happening in your case), but actually the directory can contain files/directories having the size of MB/GB range. To get the actual size of a directory on disk use du command.\nSee man du for more info. \n\nA: To wrap this up, using sudo du -chd 0 /boot you can tell the size of the files in there. You can also do sudo du -chd 1 /boot to see which folders are taking the most space.

Switching governor by applet or command line has no effect.\nUpdate: After installing cpufreqd, /var/log/syslog gets these messages in a loop:\nMar  3 13:00:03 scala cpufreqd: cpufreqd_set_profile     : Couldn't set profile \"Performance High\" set for cpu0 (2700000-2700000-performance)\nMar  3 13:00:03 scala cpufreqd: cpufreqd_loop            : Cannot set policy, Rule unchanged (\"none\").\n\nUpdate: cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/bios_limit prints 800000 (800 MHz) for all CPUs. Where does this limit come from? How to increase it?\n\nA: For CPU clock frequency governing 14.04 used the acpi-cpufreq driver by default and 14.10 uses intel_pstate driver by default. There are reports of issues similar what you are experiencing.\nAs a test, please try switching back to the acpi-cpufreq driver.\nSave a copy of your /etc/default/grub file, just in case:\nsudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.original\n\nEdit, as sudo, your /etc/default/grub file and add this parameter to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"intel_pstate=disable\"\n\nIf there are already other parameters on that line, then add the new one. Example:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"ipv6.disable=1 intel_pstate=disable crashkernel=384M-:128M\"\n\nAfter you save the file, then update grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nRe-boot the computer.\nYou could also check if you have thermald running:\nsudo service thermald status\n\nAnd if yes, and just for a quick test, disable it (Note you should monitor temperatures when thermald is disabled):\nsudo service thermald stop\n\nIf you then get some ability for the CPU frequency to increase under significant load, then something is likely wrong with your /etc/thermald/thermal-conf.xml file.\n\nA: This answer applies to the newly discovered reason of the BIOS limiting the CPU frequency.\nPlease check the condition of your power adapter and your battery. Are they functioning normally? Is the battery charging normally? Does the Laptop work O.K. on battery only?\nTypically, Dell bios forces low CPU frequency when something is wrong with the power and / or it no longer recognizes the power adapter.\nThere is a way to by-pass the inclusion of the /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/bios_limit, but it should only be done as a very last resort and with clear knowledge that the lowest level protection is being disabled.

I'm looking for a GUI application which works as nicely as Ubuntu's system settings, except that it lets me remove some of the items in it without the whole thing crashing.\nIn the current GUI, removing one of the modules (for devices like bluetooth, printers) has -in the past- made the whole system settings (GUI) application disappear.\nI want to make it more difficult for anyone to use such devices (printer, bluetooth) through my computer (until -if ever- I decide otherwise).\n\nA: *\n\n*unity-control-center relys on .desktop files and their commands existence to show UI modules.\n\n\n*\n\n*That's what I got from tracing it.\nstrace -o Desktop/trace_control_center.txt unity-control-center\n\n\n*Click on printer then close it\n\n*Check for operations: stat,if successful followed by open, itself if successful followed by read\ngrep -i printer Desktop/trace_control_center.txt\n\n\n\n*So, Just remove their .desktop file or change its permission:\nsudo chmod -r /usr/share/applications/unity-bluetooth-panel.desktop\nsudo chmod -r /usr/share/applications/system-config-printer.desktop\n\nBTW, unity-control-center is forked from gnome-control-center, same as unity-settings-daemon from gnome-settings-daemon.

On a desktop 8.4 GB is a lot. For a server the 9.1 is not enough. I have a desktop version with MySQL (so technically it is a server) running and some test databases for data analyses. My root stays around 10Gb and 15Gb so I would advise a 20Gb if you use this as a server too. But if this is a normal desktop system there might be some log files that contain errors and grow. Fix the error, delete the old logs and you will have more free space in /.\n\n*merge / and /home. There is not really any reason any more to have a separate /home. During installation you can nowadays opt to keep your current documents. If you do not want to merge you can also opt to shrink /home and add the unallocated space to /.

Then, to give it root privileges:\nsudo usermod -a -G sudo newusername\n\nNow hit Ctrl+Alt+F7 to switch back to the GUI.  You may need to reboot to get everything working properly.

There, too, the open source driver was a good fallback.\n\nA: to avoid the login loop you can install and use different login manager or use new clean user account in your old login manager,if you want create new clean user account,install another login manager first (example:gdm) via command line if you dont have any,then change your login manager type \"sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\" then change the login manager to gdm,next login into gdm with your old account,after that search for user account application, make a new account here and dont forget to make the password.after finished change your login manager back to lightdm,then login with your new clean user account.note that your new clean user account will use default setting for your ubuntu.\n\nA: I have same problem in 11.04.

I've created a neat little script that downloads a JPG using wgetand then sets it as the Unity desktop background with\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/myname/wallpaper.jpg\n\nAfter running the script, the desktop wallpaper is incomplete but when I open the downloaded image, it is fine! When I manually run the gsettings command, the same thing happens - so I don't think the problem could be that gsettings starts before the image is downloaded completely.\nWhat is causing this odd problem, and how can I fix it? \n\n\n*\n\n*Exhibit A: my neat little script.  \n\n*Exhibit B: My desktop with an incomplete background image:\n.  \n\n*Exhibit C: original image url.

Is it better to create another partition to store all the files created by a user, to separate them from files created by programs in /home? \nDoes the separation have the following benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backing up changing files can create corrupted files in the backup. in /home, programs may be changing some user-specific files without user's notice. If we only need to back up user-created files, then backing up will not be affected by those programs?\n\n*does putting user-created files and program-created files in /home risk that programs might delete user created files accidentally? \nFor example, Windows running under virtualbox under Ubuntu created a big file in /home. If there is something wrong with virtualbox, Windows, or some program running inside Windows, is it possible the user created files elsewhere in /home might be modified?\nAre there other examples that programs more likely accidentally modify user-created files?\nWhat drawbacks can the separation of program-created and user-created files into /homeand another different partition have? \nThanks!\n\nA: As long as you always mount your separate data partition I can see little if no benefits for the security aspects you mentioned.\nAny mounted partition including your data partition can be written to by you and by all your applications in case you had the appropriate permissons. A virtualised Windows will however only be able to access you data in case you had defined a shared folder or network access (the big file it creates is a closed virtual hard drive container).\nStill, there may be cases where splitting our HOME and a dedicated data partition may be useful.\nExamples:\n\n\n*\n\n*have a shared partition accessible to other users using ACL\n\n*have data that should only be read but never be written to (mount as read only)\n\n*ease maintaining a different backup strategy for data vs. application settings (but this can also be done without a dedicated data partition)\n\n*access data from different Linux distributions or releases in a multi-boot setting where application settings should not be shared\n\n*have your OS and HOME on a small SSD but want to keep big files (virtual machine disks, videos, music, pictures) on a large conventional drive\n\n*store sensible data in an encrypted partition when you do not need an encryption of all of your home\n\n", "Q: what free percentage is good for a partition to maintain? The use% of most my partitions (including /,/home, and two ntfs partitions shared between Windows and Ubuntu) are more than 90%. \nNow I plan to replace my hard drive with a bigger one, and install a new Ubuntu release. So I will have to design how much the size of each partition will be.\nAre there some rules of thumb that suggest what percentage of unused space for a partition will be good  for whatever reasons, such as \n\n\n*\n\n*performance, \n\n*not stressing out due to limit space, \n\n*ext's auto defragmentation, \n\n*backup\n\n*...?\n\n\nFor example, is it generally better to keep 50% unused for some above reasons? Will 50% unused be a waste? what range of percentage is better for balancing between space wasting and other factors?\nDoes the filesystem type matter? I am now using ext4 and ntfs, but will probably use ext4 exclusively after I install a latest Ubuntu release.\n\nA: While it would be impossible to give a fixed percentage of space you should keep empty, following points may help you to find a range. Also note that most factors depend upon the net condition of drive, rather than the partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Fragmentation\nLinux Fragments very less, so this should be a very vague issue. \n\n*Performance.\nAgain, there would be very less an issue of performance. The speed would more depend upon the read write speed of disk than on how much it is filled. Also the minor effect, if any, would be considered only for servers, not for personal computers. You may choose to use SSD for better performance.\n\n*Backup\nIt is better to backup data on a separate drive, so that you won't lose data in case of drive failure. So this should not be a issue.\n\n*File overwriting\nWhen you delete files, they are not really deleted, but just removed from the index(look at man shred). If you have a filled drive, you have a greater chance of overwriting your old deleted files, thus increasing security.\n\n\nNow having considered these factors. I would suggest,\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot,if you decide to have a separate one, should have enough space. Maybe a extra 10GB should suffice.\n\n*/home would be better have as much as it can, as this will serve you in case\n\n*\n\n*You need to copy large files in case of an  emergency(a Hard drive is failing)\n\n*You have to use the partition as a transition device for transferring files from one device to other.\n\n\n\nI would recommend using the ext4 filesystem, for reason that Ubuntu and most linux would probably support it better than anything else. It also has some features which may not be in others(eg. less defragmentation)\n\nA: Depending on your use case (and budget) you should use the following % and absolute values (whichever is largest) for DATA HDDs. (SSDs are a totally different kind of animal, as are system partitions)\n\n\n*\n\n*5% Don't go lower then this as Linux will start fragmenting\nThe largest file on your disk.\n\n*10% for machines that need high performance but where the budget is restricted\nTwice the size of the largest file on your disk\n\n*33% for machines that need optimum performance and budget is relaxed\n3 times the size of the largest file on your disk\nWhy?\n\n\n*\n\n*5: when you copy large files when 95% of the disk is full, Linux will start fragmenting and the usual defragmentation strategy is: back-up, wipe, restore\n\n*10: root will mostly have enough space to perform even under stressed conditions.\n\n*33: the hard disk heads will not have to move outside of 2/3 of the radius of the disk, therefore limiting the distance the heads will have to travel to read their data, therefore increasing the speed of the average disk access compared to using them at 100% unless stressed conditions force them (only available to root)\n\n\nTo actually tune the file system to these percentages:\ntune2fs -m iPercentage /dev/XdY\n\nwhere iPercentage is the % you choose/calculate and X is the drive type and Y is the drive letter.  E.g.:\ntune2fs -m 10 /dev/sda\n\n", "Q: Behringer ASIO audio card in Ubuntu I am owner of Behringer UMC202 audio card and i want to get it working with my Ubuntu 14.04 PC.

In fact, installing JACK may very well be the source of your problems. Usually it is the other way round: USB audio devices work on Linux out of the box while drivers are needed for Windows. \nThe most frequent problem is that one of the channels is muted or at a low volume, or that JACK is messing things up. So my suggestion is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Undo everything you've done, including installing JACK.\n\n*Unplug the sound card, reboot your system, login and then plug the sound card back in and select it from the sound settings.\n\n*Install and run pavucontrol (a GUI tool) to see if anything is muted\n\n*Then also run alsamixer (from a terminal) to check any other channels. In alsamixer, press F6 to select your sound card, then F5 to show all channels. Check that none have the muted checkbox set. Press M to mute/unmute channels.\n\n\nIf it works after these steps, and you are sure that you absolutely need the (possibly) lower latency that JACK provides, you can then always go and try using the device again using JACK. But you should make sure that the device works beforehand.\n", "Q: Add custom keyboard shortcut to change keyboard layout In windows, I usually use Alt + Shift to change between keyboard layout.

I searched the Internet for countless hours and even started a thread on this board about that, but nothing helped.\nThat's why I want to have a Windows 7 partition.\nI made a Ubuntu 14.10 live CD and opened gparted, but I can't resize the partition!\nI have three partitions:\n/dev/sda1 fat32 /boot/efi 512 MB \n/dev/sda2 ext2 /boot 244MB\n/dev/sda3 lvm2 pv ubuntu-vg 697,9 GB\nI could resize the first two partitions, but the gain is obviously not worth mentioning.\nThe only partition that makes sense to resize is sda3, but when I try that, it tells me that the minimum and maximum size are the same, so I can't do anything there.\nIt's funny, because when I use the Disk Usage Analyzer, it tells me that only 23 GB of the 729,1 GB are used.\nIs there any way to get a new partition with some 100 GB for Windows without breaking Ubuntu?\nThe only other way I would see, is to format that partition using gparted from the live CD, create two separate partitions (one of them NTFS), install Windows7 and then install Ubuntu again.\nBut I hope that won't be necessary.\nCheers\n\nA: The problem is that you selected to use LVM (Logical Volume Management) when you installed Ubuntu. It provides to functionality to easily resize your Ubuntu partitions. THEORETICALLY! I tried that too on my first install and I found it not so easy. \nWell, first of all it creates one large partition with all the space you gave to Ubuntu. Inside this partition it \"installs\"(?) the LVM which somehow emulates logical volumes (=virtual partitions inside the large one). Now those partitions can be easily resized or whatever within the LVM container using the right tools.\nBUT to gParted it looks like the whole partition is full because all space is reserved for the LVM. Therefore: no free space, no resizing the partition.\nHowever, it is somehow possible to do that, according to the answers here.\nThey either install the GUI tool system-config-lvm or another answer suggests to do the following:  \n\nIn this example we shrink a partition from 10G to 9G:\nFirst, we unmount. umount /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah\n  Check the file system. e2fsck -f /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah\n  Resize the file system. resize2fs -p /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah 9G\n  Reduce the size of the logical volume. lvreduce -L -1G /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah\n  Shrink the volume group if desired. vgreduce vg_blah /dev/sdxy\n\nPlease VISIT the original post!

This becomes a never ending loop and I'm not able to complete the installation.\nHow can I successfully install and boot Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS and Windows 8.1 Pro, on an Acer S7 191-6400 Ultrabook?\n\nA: I found my own solution detailed below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a fresh copy of Windows 8.1 Pro from the original Microsoft DVD and make a bootable USB drive, as described here. During the Windows setup process, choose custom type of installation, in which you're allowed to configure partitions. Erase all the existing partitions except the computer's recovery partitions and created a primary partition large enough for your needs, and install Windows 8.\nIf you do not want to install a fresh copy of Windows, I strongly encourage you to make a backup of your current windows setup and shrink one of your partitions to make room for the Ubuntu operating system as described here.\nLeave the Windows Fast Startup activated but disable the UEFI BIOS Secure Boot in order to finally boot into Ubuntu.\n\n*Download the Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS 64-bit ISO image and create a bootable Live USB drive, as described here or here.\n\n*To boot into the Ubuntu Live USB drive, click Restart in Windows while holding down the Shift key. From here you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes, the Use a device option will show up in the upcoming screen, which will automatically boot into the Live USB drive. \n\n*Sometimes the option is not there and you have to select Troubleshoot, Advanced Options, UEFI Firmware Settings, and Restart. \nOnce in the UEFI BIOS, either go to the Main tab and enable F12 Boot Menu or go to the Boot tab and move your USB drive to the top of the list. Exit the BIOS, saving the changes, tap the F12 key, and boot into the Live USB drive.\n\n\n*When the GNU GRUB screen comes up, select Try Ubuntu without Installing and boot into a Live instance of Ubuntu.\nNow this is the critical part that makes the difference and has not been made explicitly clear anywhere else.\n\n\n*Here, go to 'Dash Home' and search and run gparted. When the application first starts, you might get a Libparted Bug Found! error popup: \nThe backup GPT table is not at the end of the disk. \nThis might mean that another operating system believes the disk is smaller. \nFix, by moving the backup to the end (and removing the old backup)?\n\nClick on Fix and another 'Libparted Warning' window popped up, saying:\nNot all of the space available to /dev/mapper/isw_hhidjbh_HDD0 appears to be used, \nyou can fix the GPT to use all of the space (an extra 512 blocks) or continue with the current setting?'\n\nClick Fix once again, and then one last 'Libparted Bug Found!' comes up:\nInvalid argument during seek for read on /dev/sda\n\nClicked Cancel on this one!\n\n*Once the GParted application finally runs, create a root and a swap partition, as described in here, hit Applyand you'll get All operations successfully completed.

Then another Libparted Bug Found! pops up saying again Invalid argument during seek for read on /dev/sda.\nClicked Cancel and close the GParted application.\n\n*Now you're ready to install Ubuntu. Connect to the WiFi network and run Install Ubuntu from the desktop.\n\n*Followed all the steps as described in here up until the 'Installation Type' window, where it asks if you want to Erase disk and install Ubuntu and choose Something else. This is the screen where the option to Install Ubuntu alongside Microsoft Windows 8.1 should have come up.\n\n*In the next window, you'll see the partitions that you created with GParted in step 6. Select the root partition, hit Change, changed Use as: to ext4 journaling file system, check Format the partition, and selected / as the Mounting point.\n\n*Set the Device for boot loader installation to /dev/mapper/isw_hhidjbh_HDD0, matching the partition names in the list. Then select the root partition in the list and click on Install Now. And this will finish the installation successfully without errors! :D\n\n*Boot to the bootable USB drive with the Windows setup once again. Follow the initial instructions up until the point were you can configure the partitions and quit the installation and when the computer restarts, it will boot into Windows 8.1 Pro without problems. \n\n*To boot into Ubuntu, reboot and go back into the UEFI BIOS, disable Secure Boot as described in here, and enable F12 Boot Menu as described in step 3.\n\n*Now you can boot into both operating systems by tapping the 'F12' upon restart and using the boot menu.\n", "Q: using ThinRDC (thinomenon) on Ubuntu I am trying to run a remoteApp hosted on a windows 7 enterprise, from an Ubuntu client 14.01.

Nobody can predict a power failure. Or you pressing the reset button or pulling a cord from the machine. \nYou never mess with desktop enviroments, filesystems, videocard configurations without making an extra backup and making sure you can restore that backup. \nAnd extra: also always make sure you have a working Live DVD so you can restore that backup from the Live DVD. \nIf you do that: feel free to mess around with anything even /home.

I wonder why Ubuntu won't remove the old kernels automatically. \nSurely nothing is perfect and things can go wrong, so in case a update doesn't work, having a backup kernel maybe great. But it would also suffice to just keep the latest  kernel and the one before the latest and delete all the older ones.\nIs there a reason why Ubuntu won't do this automatically?.                  \n\nA: \nIs there a reason why Ubuntu wont do this automatically?\n\nI can see only 1 reason: it does not work flawlessly; there is no clean way to currently decide what the definition of \"old kernels\" is. \"old\" does not mean \"unused\" nor does it mean \"unwanted\".  And any mistake in this will kill a users' machine.\nSo up to now the manual method is preferred since this puts the power of removing into the users' hands.\n\nResources for this conclusion:\n\nUbuntu WIKI: Proposal for removing old kernels\nLast-good-boot is implemented fully in Intrepid/8.10 final, however it has been disabled because it was not considered stable enough. The setting is a single line in the file /etc/default/kernel-helper-rc.\n\n\n\nLaunchpad: Should aptitude provide a way to remove old kernel versions ?\napt-get has an autoremove feature that uninstalls all packages that are not needed as dependencies and have not been installed manually. Since Ubuntu 14.04 all obsolete kernels and headers should automatically be flagged as no more needed, and thus can be purged with the apt-get autoremove command. (There are reports that this does not yet fully work). I am not aware of a feature in aptitude that is similar to apt-get's autoremove.\n\n\n\nUbuntu-devel: Distro-provided mechanism to clean up old kernels \nWhile agreeing that it would be quite helpful and seems appropriate to have the\ncleanup automatic, there is a slight potential pitfall (or two). There are\nvarious flavours of kernels and people may or may not deliberately have those\ninstalled in parallel. Also various releases had sometimes a changing set of\ndepending packages. For a while this should be only linux-backports-modules\n(there had been linux-ubuntu-modules and linux-restricted-modules). Though this\nis not so much of a problem.\nFrom a pattern matching point of view the generic-pae kernels are a bit of a\npain as they tend to ruin the \"use the last part of a split by \"-\" for the flavor\".\nBut anyway, I think the main issue is the various flavours, so a cleanup that is\nautomatic should retain the last three of each, even though this may tend to\nleave more kernels around.\n\n\nA: The simple-minded way to remove old kernels is to use ubuntu-tweak.  You select the Janitor tag and tick the Old Kernel box.  That gives you a list of kernels it thinks you don't need any more.  You can select them all and click Clean and, after a while, the job's done.  Being of a nervous disposition I checked which kernel I was running using uname -a but it didn't figure on the list.  This worked on my wife's laptop (which has a rather small boot partition and was showing warnings) and mine (which was working fine).  Does everyone agree that this is safe?\n\nA: There are two things going on here:\n\n\n*\n\n*New kernels are completely new packages, not updated packages with a newer version number, so installing a new kernel image doesn't replace any older ones. They coexist.\n\n*Ubuntu uses a bunch of apt magic to protect the last two kernel versions from 'apt-get autoremove' (the latest one, and the one that was last booted). See /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove-kernels for details.\nWhat this all means is that once you've rebooted into the latest kernel, 'apt-get autoremove' should remove all but the current and last booted kernel packages.\nOld kernels still accumulate in /boot because autoremove is not enabled in Ubuntu by default - you must either run it manually every so often, or you must enable it.\nThis may change in 16.04 - a bugfix to the unattended-upgrades package will enable autoremove of old kernels by default.\n\nA: This script will do the job. It ll remove all kernels that are not in use.\nsudo dpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d' | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\nOther then that, not removing kernels must be a fairly new thing. I have one Ubuntu 14 system after the other running into this issue of a full boot partition due to old kernel garbage. \nIt can make the life of less experienced users extremely complicated. It is actually a noob trap. Canonical should fix this. \n\nA: Ubuntu only auto-removes items that are no longer needed or are a security risk...So I assume that the reason for this is security purposes. Lets say for some odd reason a new kernel becomes insecure...Then you would be rerouted back to the old kernel temporarily while the new one is being fixed. Also new kernels can come with changes so therefore some kernels are opt-in for example updating 14.04.1 to 14.04.2 you can opt-in for a new kernel, but this April when the new LTS version 15.04 comes out you will automatically have you kernels updates. So I reckon that its for security purposes.\nbut if you want to remove it try running this command line\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThis should remove any unneeded software such as your old kernel if not try\nsudo apt-get remove (kernels-name)\n\n\nA: I recommand use Ubuntu Tweak to remove old kernels. look here: \nHow do I remove old kernel versions to clean up the boot menu?\n\nA: I think the latest release of Ubuntu 15.10 could remove old kernels automatically, if you edit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades file:\nChange line \n\n//Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies \"false\";\n\nto \n\nUnattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";\n\nI haven't tested this, though.\n\nA: I had a problem with being unable to install software. Apt-get was unable to install linux-headers, reporting the disk was full.$ df -i reported that IUse% was at 100%: The disk had free space but had run out of inodes. $ sudo dpkg --configure -a failed, & so did $ sudo apt-get -f install and $ sudo apt-get autoremove\nThe problem solved when I manually removed several of the older kernel folders from /usr/src - just $ rm or shift-delete the folders. This freed up enough inode space to allow $ apt-get -f install to complete. \nAfter that I had only 10 linux kernels. I ran $ sudo apt-get autoremove which deleted 1.4 GB of files. Which begs the question: Really?? Really?? But honestly, is the this the right way to run a user friendly system?\n", "Q: access ubuntu server running in virtualbox from outside network? Is it possible to access ubuntu server running in virtualbox from outside network?\nI set it up with the bridget network adapter so it has its own IP. I can access my ubuntu server from inside my own network, which is great(see this link). \nNext, I tried to access it from outside my network. I used my mobile phone for that(not WiFi ofcourse)\ncurl ifconfig.me\n\nthis gave me my outside IP. I tried to access it, but my browser couldn't connect. I noticed all my devices have the same outside IP.\nIs it possible to access ubuntu server running in virtualbox from outside network or do I need to install it on a separate system?\n\nA: Regardless of whether the server is a real or a virtual machine, you will need to forward the appropriate port(s) across your LAN router, i.e. translate from the public IP you obtained from ifconfig.me to the server's private IP. You will need to refer to your router's documentation to see how to do that for your specific device.\nIf you wanted to use the VM in NAT mode, it should just require the additional step of forwarding the equivalent ports across that as well, i.e. from the host's real LAN IP to the VM guest's virtual LAN IP.\n", "Q: AVG Downloaded but I cannot run I downloaded AVG to pc.  I am running Ubuntu 14.04. When I open a terminal window and type AVGsetup it comes back saying:\nPermission denied\n\n\nA: According to the License Agreement on use of AVG AntiVirus Free Edition, the AVG license grants you permission to use AVG AntiVirus Free Edition \"solely ... on a single computer\". The definition of solely which is \"not involving anyone or anything else; only\" seems to be restrictive enough that it fully excludes installing AVG on more than one computer. I think that \"anything else\" would also exclude installing AVG on both OSs of a single computer with a dual boot. I think that the words \"anything else\" mean that you can install AVG on one operating system for personal use and that's it. Unlike the ClamTk antivirus application from the Ubuntu Software Center, which you can install on as many computers as you like.\nInstallation\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit the Download AVG AntiVirus Free 2015 website.  \n\n*Under the AVG AntiVirus Free - for Linux header download the .deb file for installing AVG AntiVirus in Debian-based systems like Ubuntu.  \n\n*Users of 64-bit Ubuntu should enable MultiArch if it isn't already enabled by running the following command in the terminal:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\n\n*Double click the AVG .deb file to open it for installation in the Ubuntu Software Center. This is the easiest way to install AVG AntiVirus in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to install qpdfview 0.4.14? I have been using the 0.4.12 build for a couple of months now and am ready to update to 0.4.14. I've tried a couple of things to install it but for fear of screwing up my Trusty environment I thought I would ask the experts here. \nWhat I've tried (using terminal):\n\n\n*\n\n*unpacked the targz file\n\n*cd to Downloads\n\n*cd archive name\n\n*then tried ./configure which did not work\n\n*looked in the README file and found the instructions a bit vague for my level of linux understanding\n\n\nAny help would greatly be appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: As you can see here, qpdfview 0.4.14 is part of the \"universe\" repository from 15.10 onwards. So, as long as you have that repository enabled, you can simply install with\nsudo apt-get install qpdfview\n\nAlso, you can always check the version available for your distro using apt-cache policy <package_name>. You will get something like this:\nlucho@lucho-HP:~$ apt-cache policy qpdfview\nqpdfview:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 0.4.14-1\n  Version table:\n *** 0.4.14-1 500\n        500 mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt xenial/universe amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n\nA: I am not sure if this is too late but you can simply add and install the qpdfview PPA with:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:b-eltzner/qpdfview\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qpdfview\n\n\nA: The latest versions of qpdfview (0.4.18beta1 at this time) are always available at the developer's PPA. These daily are builds, and should not be considered stable, but I've had no issues so far:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:adamreichold/qpdfview-dailydeb\nsudo apt update\n\nJust make sure you have removed any previous versions using\nsudo apt remove qpfview\n\nbefore installing using the usual sudo apt install qpfview\n", "Q: Entirely disable suspension (at kernel level? - has to be independent of used DE and login state!) Once again I need a workaround to deal with my almost broken notebook graphics card: It does not wake up after suspending!\nThe Ubuntu 14.10 system is waking up, but the display stays off, so I have to press the Power button and blindly navigate to the \"Shutdown\" option, to avoid a hard power off.\nI already disabled suspending for all of my user accounts by following this answer. However, I now have seen three times when it actually DID do suspending!\nThat was:\n\n\n*\n\n*once after I let my notebook on over night (can't remember last state...)\n\n*once after I closed the lid before I logged into any user account after boot\n\n*once when the notebook was not in use quite a long time (few hours max.) after leaving it on the lock-screen\n\n\nI think somehow it is still allowed for the system to use suspension and that there is no rule set for the login/lock screen.\nNow, can I disable the suspension functionality there too?\n\nUpdate:\nI recently installed lubuntu-desktop to try LXDE instead of Unity. Now in Lubuntu mode, I can not disable suspending at all. Closing the lid does a suspend which also causes the screen to die until I reboot.\nSo the solution has to be independent of the used DE!\n\nEdit:\nComputer information: lspci -v\n00:00.0 Host bridge:

Is there a method to search specifically for those charms that support installation on Ubuntu 14.04 LE on Power PC?\n\nA: We do not have a list of charms that support Power PC (ppc64le) because the majority of the charms work on that platform.  Starting with 14.04 the Ubuntu archives have been compiled for ppc64le architecture, so the charms that install packages from the Ubuntu archives will continue to work as before.  \nSome charms install from Personal Package Archives (PPA) and those packages may or may not be compiled for ppc64le.  As the name suggests those archives are privately owned and maintained and may not have been compiled for ppc64le architecture.  Any other charms that install binaries from other private locations may not have ppc64le architecture options.\nThere was an effort to identify the charms that do not work well on ppc64le and fix the charms.  Some charms have already been fixed.  Bugs have been filed for charms that someone has identified not working on ppc64le in launchpad.  Use this URL to list those bugs:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/charms?field.searchtext=ppc64le\nIf you find any other problems with charms on ppc64le be sure to report a bug on launchpad.net and tag the bug with ppc64le.\n\nA: We currently do not have a way to show you exactly which charms run on which architectures. \nIdeally it shouldn't matter, but since charms can grab packages from anywhere it really depends. Here's the general hand-wavy way to tell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any charm using docker won't work (as docker doesn't run on ppc64le yet)\n\n*Any charm using a third-party repository probably doesn't work unless that project has specifically published ppc64le binaries. Some like, Elasticsearch, do not. Here's an example from when that happens. \n\n\nAny charm that is just apt-get installing from the normal Ubuntu repositories or PPAs should Just Work. For PPAs some maintainers might not know there's a checkbox for enabling POWER-builds, but that can be fixed with a simple email to the maintainer. \nIn the future when ppc64le is added to the CI system for charms this will become easy to tell, we're just not quite there yet. For charms that don't run on ppc64le it's usually best to find out what the exact problem is, and then reporting it appropriately so that someone can fix it. \n", "Q: Geany annonying line I am using Geany for C programming.

Install was relatively easy, however Ive run into a problem with my unusual setup. \n\nSo laptop 1 (host) is hard-wired to a monitor through a vga cable. The monitor is placed above the laptop screen so that when I move the cursor to the top of the laptop 1s screen it appears on the bottom of the monitor screen, using xrandr. This is where synergy comes in. I want to link laptop 1s screen with another laptop sitting to the right of it. When moving the cursor to the right hand edge of laptop 1 it does not transfer to laptop 2 (client) as intended (green arrow). However, after moving the cursor up to the Monitor, moving it to the right hand side of the monitor screen transfers it over to Laptop 2 via synergy (red arrow). Im wondering if there is anyway to have my cursor follow the green arrow path straight from laptop 1s screen to laptop 2 without having to go through the monitor.\nSorry, that was really convoluted. Ive googled around for answers but frankly I wasnt even entirely sure what terms to google. \"VGA synergy\" and \"HDMI synergy\" had the closest results but nothing that got the job done. I'd be happy to answer any clarifying questions as Im not sure I adequately explained the issue.\nXubuntu 14.10.10 on old Thinkpad running the latest version of synergy.\n\nA: The info you are looking for is located at http://synergy-project.org/wiki/Text_Config\nSynergy considers your Laptop1 screen and the externally connected monitor as 1 screen.\nUsing monitors with different sizes/resolutions you have to do a little bit of calculating to get a smooth transition.\n Example:\n  Laptop1 = 1024 x  768\n  Laptop2 =  800 x  600\n  Monitor = 1920 x 1080 \n  Total vertical resolution of Laptop1 = 1848px\n  600px (Laptop2) = 32% of 1848px\nThe minimal config file for this example would be:\nsection: screens\n    Laptop1:\n    Laptop2:\nend\n\nsection links:\n    Laptop1:\n        right(68,100) = Laptop2\n    Laptop2:\n        left          = Laptop1(68,100)\nend\n\nThis assumes the bottom of Laptop1 and Laptop2 are aligned. If e.g. Laptop2 is placed somewhat higher than Laptop1 you can adjust the percentages to e.g. (60,92) until you reach the desired result.\nThis also assumes Laptop1 and Laptop2 are the actual hostnames. If this isn't the case you can either replace in the above example Laptop1 and Laptop2 with the hostnames, or add this section to the config file and adjust the ip/hostname accordingly:\nsection: aliases\n    Laptop1:\n        ip/hostname \n    Laptop2:\n        ip/hostname\nend\n\n\nA: If you have installed synergy from a .deb file or repository as shown here, you can use the command synergy to setup the layout of screens. \nIf it is the first time you run synergy, you can skip the registration process and select a \"server installation\". After that you can use an administration GUI to configure everything. Afterwards, every time you run synergy, you will get the administration GUI directly.\nIn the administration GUI, you can click on the Configure Server... button and configure the location of the screens of the other machines. You may check more instructions in the internet.\n", "Q: How can I run a script when the power supply is plugged-in or -out? For some reason, my laptop's screen brightness does not update when I plug-in or plug-out the power supply. I've looked at quite a few solutions for that problem, but none of them seemed to work well. So, instead of despairing and giving up, I decided to try to turn this into a learning experience and see if I can't write a script that does it for me. \nI tried figuring it out on my own, with some help from the internet, of course, but I'm pretty new to bash scripting and Ubuntu in general, so I didn't get far.\nWhat I was able to figure out was that I can find the state of the battery with \n$ upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT1 | grep -E \"state\"\nstate:     charging/discharging\n\ndepending on whether or not the AC adapter is plugged in. I don't know if that's even useful, but it's kinda cool, and I didn't know how to use grep before, so what the hell, learning is fun.\nAnyways, is there a somewhat clean way to do this? By \"clean way\" I just mean a way that one with limited bash script experience could comprehend. \nOne similar question I found that had a good answer is this one, which says the following: \n\nWhen you plug in/out the AC adapter, the scripts in /etc/pm/power.d get called with >an argument: \"true\" (if you run on battery), or \"false\" (if you run with the power >adapter).\n\nThe problem is that I don't know how to access that argument from within a script. So, I guess it all boils down to a pretty simple problem, but I thought I'd post the question anyways, in case people had better solutions. \n\nA: You can use on_ac_power to run a script when the power supply is turned on or off.\nTry the following in a terminal.\n$ on_ac_power\n$ echo $?\n0              ## Laptop on ac power\n\n$ on_ac_power\n$ echo $?\n1              ## Laptop on battery (not on ac power)\n\nBased on this you can make your script as,\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true\ndo\n    if on_ac_power; then \n        do_something               ## Laptop on power\n    else\n        do_something_else          ## Laptop on battery\n    fi\n    sleep 10                       ## wait 10 sec before repeating\ndone\n\n\nEDIT:\ncron job would be a better idea for running the script at a regular interval instead of using an infinite loop.\nSave your script as myscript.sh and put the following content in it,\n#!/bin/bash\nif on_ac_power; then \n    do_something\nelse\n    do_something_else\nfi\n\nMake the script executable from a terminal, chmod +x /path/to/myscript.sh. Open your personal crontab as EDITOR=gedit crontab -e and append the following line in it to run your script every minute.\n* * * * * /path/to/myscript.sh \n\n", "Q: Taking video and snapshots simultaneously using a webcam I'm trying to do something fairly specific and I was wondering if anyone had some suggestions for ways to do it.\nI'm working on a program and for it I need an application to do the following utilizing a webcam:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be able to locally broadcast live video from a webcam to the user on the screen at a decent frame-rate (somewhere around 10 would be nice)\n\n*From this live broadcast, be able to take single image snapshots at a commanded time\nI'm looking for something that runs on the command line, preferably. I've tried using VLC which is nice for the first part, but in order to take a screenshot, I haven't found a way to do so using the command line. In order for that to work in my application I would need to simulate keystrokes with an active window which may make it a bit difficult to implement.\nIf anyone has any other suggestions as well using basic terminal commands that would also work, I'm fully open to them.\n\nA: The easiest way to accomplish this, would be to do the exact opposite of what you're trying to do: \n\n\n*\n\n*first capture still pictures \n\n*then convert those still pictures to a video\n(so basically a combination of both above answers)\nI would: take a minimum of 16 fps as that is the minimum our brain needs to see smooth motion\nIf this is for a web application, you wouldn't even have to convert these still images to a video stream as you could use JavaScript to display 16 images every second (refresh page 16 times per second) provided you've got enough bandwidth available to upload 16 pictures / second. But that depends on your specific use case.\n", "Q: Rekordbox alternative for ubuntu There is a programm called \"Rekordbox\" from Pioneer for Windows. With this tool you can export your songs  to an usb stick and play it with the cd players. When you plug in the stick to the cd players you have a lot of more informations on the little screen rather just copy the files to the usb stick. Since wine doesn't support usb export with Rekordbox, this is pretty useless for me.\nWhich tool I can use instead?\n\nA: I recently bought a Pioneer XDJRR controller with embedded Rekordbox and I feel your pain. I cannot use the PC version to scan all of my tracks and create a metadata file on the USB. Also, the controller only seems to show a waveform when the track has been scanned by Rekordbox (I much prefer using my ears but it still looks cooler than a wall of text.\nI have a Linux-friendly workaround that I have been using to make my life easier\nMy work around is a bit of a hack, and maybe someone with mad coding skills could make a utility that automates the task.\n\n*\n\n*Install Mixxx open source DJ software on your Linux machine.\n\n\n*right click on 'Playlists' and select create new; give it a name.\n\n\n*Drag your tracks into the playlist window.\n\n\n*Right-click on the playlist name and select 'Analyze entire playlist'. This will get all the BPM counts for you and add it to the playlist window. I've found this to be very accurate.\n\n\n*Now for the mundane part: Open the actual folder containing all of these tracks and append the BPM count to all of the file names. You might want to keep the rest of the file name tight so you don't have to wait too long for the Pioneer machine to scroll the track title. Whatever works best for you though.\n\n\n*Another thing that you might want to do is to use Audacity to convert all of your 24bit WAV files to 16bit. I know this sounds like a real cop out, especially if you're an audiophile like me, but for some reason, my Pioneer system doesn't seem to like 24bit files. At the end of the day, 16bit is the resolution found on CDs - still not bad and probably mostly unnoticeable by PA gear or the audience.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Rekordbox is proprietary software and the way data is stored is not published as far as I know, so alternative software would have to reverse engineer it.\nAs you mentioned USB export does not seem to be supported in wine:\nhttps://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=26945\nA way forward could be to think about a way to workaround it.\nSo either do a HDD export and see if the data is transferable to USB.\nThe winehq link has someone asking for help, you can see how far you get.\nAnother way to walk would be to get wine usb support to the level that the program needs.\nMaybe not a direct solution, but the answer to your question about which other tool can be used, I think is \"none at the moment\".\n", "Q: Image viewer without antialiasing I need an image viewer with the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Infinite zoom in and zoom out. \n\n*No antialiasing. I want to see pixels as is and as close as I want to.\n\n*Mouse control.\n\n*(optional) Show pixel coordinates and RGBa value.\n\n\nI tried shotwell (the default on my system), gpicview, sxiv and feh but none of them is both handy enough and satisfies my needs.\nGimp does the thing, but it is too heavy to be run just as image viewer.\n\nA: The default Linux Image Viewer (as of now at least) supports the no anti-aliasing option: go to Image Viewer > Preferences > Image Viewer and turn off Smooth images when zoomed out/in. The infinite zoom-in is still missing.\n\nA: Geeqie is lightweight and will do the job.\nTo install sudo apt-get install geeqie\nIn order to disable anti-aliasing go to Edit > Preferences > Preferences > Image and change zoom quality to nearest and disable two pass rendering. \nIn order to show pixel coordinates and RGB value go to View and check Pixel Info\n", "Q: How can I mount a SMB share exactly like Nautilus does it? I have an...interesting problem.  You see, I have a SMB share on a network that I would like to mount locally.  When I use Nautilus to mount it, everything works perfectly.  However, I need to configure the system to run without a GUI, meaning that I can't use Nautilus and instead must create an fstab entry or something similar.\nHowever, when I try to mount the share using the following fstab entry:\n//ip.address.goes.here/sharename /path/to/mountpoint cifs  username=user,password=pass,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm 0 0\n\nThe share mounts, but the permissions are seriously messed up and prevent me from doing anything.\nI know that the share can be mounted properly, as Nautilus does it.  My question is, how does Nautilus do it?\n\nA: Nautilus uses the Gnome Virtual File System (gvfs) to mount devices. In a system that's already running a gvfsd daemon you can initiate a mount manually using the gvfs-mount command e.g.\ngvfs-mount smb://ip.address.goes.here/sharename\n\nwhich should cause a link to the share to appear in the Nautilus sidebar; the actual mountpoint should appear in the filesystem at /run/user/<UID>/gvfs (or $HOME/.gvfs on earlier versions).\nI'm not sure that will be an option in a truly headless environment: I suggest you create a new question detailing your exact issues with the fstab method.\n", "Q: OpenMP unable to use multiple threads, no error associated with compilation I am using openMP for my lab assignments and everything worked fine few weeks ago, but now it runs only on one thread, I've read and I guess that this is due to conflict between packages.

Any help in this regard would be thankful. \nNot to forget, same network works fine on other devices (desktop with also ubuntu) and from the service centre of ASUS i came to know that socket of my laptop works fine.\n\nA: First of all, try with another cable.

The first part will be MacOSX formated. \nI want the second partition to read/write both Ubuntu and Windows.\nWill NTFS do it for me?\n\nA: You cannot install Ubuntu onto an NTFS partition, as NTFS does not support permissions.\nBut if you are just storing data, NTFS is fine and both Ubuntu and Windows can read/write from/to it.\nJust in case you want something that is supported by all three platforms, check out the UDF filesystem.\nEDIT: As mentioned by user Fabby, this answer details how you can actually achieve running Ubuntu and Windows on the same NTFS partition. I absolutely would not recommend it though, unless you really know what you are doing.\n", "Q: Ubuntu / Lenovo yoga Wifi issues I recently installed Ubuntu: 14.10, Kernel: 3.16.0-31-generic.

Can anyone help me?\nI would like to clean up this partitions too, keeping just what I use. \n\nA: Your /dev/sda6 partition is a logical volume inside the extended partition /dev/sda4. \nExtended partitions are like containers. They are needed, because there are (were?) only 4 primary partitions allowed at one disk. So somebody invented the extended partition, that can replace one primary partition and contain any number of logical partitions inside.\nSo now the reason why you can not enlarge sda6 is, that the container sda4 is full. You have to enlarge the extended partition first (therefore you might have to unmount all containing volumes (sda5 and sda6) and the extended partition itself (sda4)). Then, when you have free space inside the container, you can enlarge the partitions inside the container, to cover that new space.\nDo you need more explanations or could I help you?\n", "Q: Multithreaded Mail server I need to create a multuthreaded mail server on ubuntu 14.04.

The prefered location, however, is .bash_aliases   This is used by default in nearly all *buntus. \nI use a little alias to help me write aliases so I don't forget to source them, or need to close my terminals.\nCreate, or append to your ~/.bash_aliases file the following\n###### ea - alias for editing aliases\n#\n#This alias makes editing alias a\n#bit easier and they are useful right away. Note if the source failed, it will not echo \"aliases sourced  --ok\".\n#\n#Subsitute medit or your favorite editor, or alter for ksh, sh, etc.\n#\nalias ea='gedit ~/.bash_aliases; source ~/.bash_aliases && source $HOME/.bash_aliases && echo \"aliases sourced  --ok.\"'\n#\n\nThis alias ea makes writing other aliases a snap.\nEnter ea and a text editor opens .bash_aliases. Add and save your alias(es) and when the text editor is closed your .bash_aliases is then sourced meaning it is available immediately.  There will also be a echo confirmation that all is ok. So when you create your alias runmc=\"java -jar /root/.minecraft/launcher.jar\" the whole process is easier, as well as the next time you create an alias.\n", "Q: Getting rid of the p7m file extension The internet has not been helpful this time. I have a zip archive that also has a p7m extension. How can I lose that extension so that I can view the files? Any help is appreciated.\nThan you!\n\nA: Unfortunately, none of these answers worked for me. The attachment showed up in gmail's web interface as smime.p7m, and in Thunderbird (which I can now get rid of since it didn't help) as winmail.dat.\nQuickly, as a list of commands, what worked for me was the following (assuming you downloaded the smime.p7m into ~/Downloads):\nsudo apt install mpack tnef\ncd ~/Downloads\nmunpack smime.p7m\ntnef winmail.dat\nls -lt\nrm mail.eml winmail.dat\n\nTo determine if this will even help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*just install mpack\n\n*run munpack on the smime.p7m file\n\n*A new file should appear (perhaps named winmail.dat). If this is the case, run:\n\n\nfile winmail.dat # or whatever the new filename\n\n\n*\n\n*if \"winmail.dat: Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format\" appears, install tnef and complete as listed above.\n\n*if that completes successfully, you should now have your zip archive in the same directory.\n\n*otherwise, this answer won't help:\n\n\nsudo apt remove mpack tnef\nSources:\nFIX Gmail smime.p7m and tnef open mail (with winmail.dat)\nHow to open winmail.dat files on Ubuntu and Debian Linux\n\nA: Another solution, inspired from the previous user3801675's script.\nCreate a small shell script, in ~/bin directory named p7m.sh like this one:\n#!/bin/bash\n#set -x\noutdir=\"$1.out\"\nfilename=\"${1##*/}\" #extract filename, without path\noutfile=\"$outdir/${filename/.p7m/}\"\nmkdir \"$outdir\"\nopenssl pkcs7 -inform DER -in \"$1\" -print_certs -out \"$outdir/signer.pem\"\nopenssl smime -verify -in \"$1\" -inform der -noverify -signer  \"$outdir/signer.pem\" -out \"$outfile\" 2>/dev/null\nxdg-open \"$outfile\"\n#if you don't need extracted file uncoment the following line\n#rm \"$outdir/signer.pem\"; rm \"$outfile\"; rmdir $outdir\n\n\n*\n\n*Make it executable chmod +x ~/bin/p7m.sh\n\n*From a shell use the command ~/bin/p7m.sh filename.pdf.p7m\nor\n\n\n*From the file manager select filename.pdf.p7m and using mouse right click choose \"open with other application\". Then Choose the small script created above.\n\nDone.\nUsually the received file (attachment) has the extension p7m as in\nfilename.pdf.p7m \n\nThe proposed script first creates the subdirectory\nfilename.pdf.p7m.out/\n\nthen extracts the key-file signer.pem and the file filename.pdf removing the extension .p7m.\nThe two file are saved in the previously created folder.\nThe extracted file filename.pdf is opened using xdg-open instead of evince, because xdg-open can open all kinds of file using the correct application based on file type.\n\nA: p7m is an encryption format that is often used for email attachments.\nI was also not able to find a Linux tool that is able to open that file type after a quick google research. However, there exist some tools for Windows (e.g. Cryptigo p7mViewer) or OSX.\nWhat you could try if you have no access to a computer running Windows/OSX is to install the Windows emulator wine and try to install a Windows viewer in there. I can't tell you whether this would work, but it is worth a try, if that file is important for you.\nAnother possible solution could be to install Claws Mail, a mail program for Ubuntu, and this plugin. I am not sure whether that allows you to view those .p7m files with that mail program either, I just got this hint from @Toroidal in the chat.\n\nA: Create a small shell script like this one:\n#!/bin/bash\nopenssl pkcs7 -inform DER -in \"$1\" -print_certs -out \"$1.pem\"\nopenssl smime -verify -in \"$1\" -inform der -noverify -signer \"$1.pem\" -out \"$1.pdf\" 2>/dev/null\nrm \"$1.pem\"\nevince \"$1.pdf\"\nrm \"$1.pdf\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make it executable\n\n*Select \"open with other application\"\n\n*Choose the small script created above\n\n*Done.\n\n\nA: This is how S/Mime works, it enc/sign a mail, and sends it as an attachment. \nThunderbird and Evolution mail clients are both famous clients that are able to show s/mime attachments. \nAlso there are good informations on this question How to obtain a S/MIME certificate for e-mail encryption?\n\nA: Nowadays (not sure if this work in the 2015's version of openssl) one can use just\nopenssl smime -inform DER -in smime.p7m -verify -out email_body\n\nopenssl smime itself is able to get the certificates from the .p7m file if needed.\n", "Q: Why does the password for a zip-file not work?

I also want to create a dual boot and a virtual drive in virtualbox with the same windows.\nThe first thing I did was to create the windows backup on a thumb drive, then I switched HDDs to a smaller one for running the system.  When it finishes reinstalling, I want to create a dual boot for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and then a virtual drive for VirtualBox.\nThe dual boot will probably not be a problem, but I am not sure how to install windows on the virtual drive or if I'll have problems since it is the OEM version that came with my hardware.\nHas anyone successfully installed Windows 8.1 into a VirtualBox?\nIs there anything I need to know?\nMy original 1 TB HDD that came with the system is removed for protection with the original windows in it.

I currently have 23 Ign-entries, while 5 of them belong to my installation DVD.\n\nMissing translations do not make a repository unavailable. Missing InRelease files could, but if the server provides Release{,.gpg} files, then it's fine.\n\nDo they cause any harm (slow down update process, missing lists, whatever)?\n\nSlightly. Apt uses a single connection for multiple requests, so some requests would be delayed, but I don't think it makes much of a difference. As long as the proper Release{,.gpg} are also available, the repository will work fine.\n\nHow can I get rid of them if that is not a bad idea?\n\nFor translations: How can I remove the Translation entries in apt?\nFor InRelease, there will not be any such option. From this feature request that was closed wont-fix in 2015:\n\nAnyhow, 4 years later we have all accepted the new world order of\n  InRelease and the code actually changed in a way which makes it even\n  harder to avoid at least trying InRelease first, so closing as\n  wontfix.\n\n", "Q: Why do we have to unmount a USB and format it to FAT or NTFS partition before making a liveUSB? I am not able to figure out why do we have to unmount a USB and format it to FAT or NTFS partition before we can make a liveUSB. I have seen that when I use a dd command to make a liveUSB with a mounted USB, the data gets corrupted, why is it that?.\n\nA: You have multiple questions, let me answer them separately.\nLet me make a distinction between a device (located in /dev) and a mounted filesystem. Think of the device as an interface to the hardware, and the filesystem as the method to write and keep track of the data on the device. In order to write data directly to the device, it must not be in use, and by extension, mounted. A device and a mounted filesystem are different, and cannot be treated the same.\nThe reason why you must use FAT32 is because it is a universally recognized filysystem,  bootable, and the standard catch-all that motherboard manufacturers use to start the boot process.\nWhen you are trying to dd an image to a filesystem, you are trying to write raw data to a mounted filesystem without actually writing using the filesystem, which overwrites superblocks and makes each block not consistent with what data is actually present, corrupting any data that you had there.\nA metaphor:\nThink of a filing cabinet (storage device) that has a very important method of organization (superblocks and metadata), and the normal way to add, read, or remove information from that cabinet is to ask the secretary (filesystem) to do what you want her to, since she's the only one who knows how to organize the files so that they can be easily recovered. If you go and try to put information into the cabinet directly without using the secretary, then her record of what files are present and where they are is no longer correct, and she will be unable to keep track of what is in the cabinet, making the information sometimes irretrievable.\n", "Q: GRUB cannot find the ISO image on the hard-disk?

Assuming your \"newinstall\" is a user home directory, the partition starts with /newinstall,,, not /home in the line \nset isofile=\"/newinstall/kubuntu-14.10-desktop-amd64.iso\"\nloopback loop (hd1,6)$isofile\n\nThe other potential issue is the enumeration of disks may differ at the grub prompt and in the final running system.  You would expect your sdb to be the hd1 at the grub prompt, but sometimes, hd0 and hd1 seem to be reversed.  I did try the fix mentioned above, since I have an iso on a mounted partition, and the boot succeeded, but with an external (non-bootable) USB hard disk plugged in, the hd0 (in my case for sda) had to be manually changed to hd1 for the boot to work.  Without the USB disk, the hs0 worked.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu format my external hard drive? I am using a Toshiba Canvio Connect 2TB Portable Hard Drive on my Microsoft Windows 7 laptop. \nAlso, I am testing Ubuntu Desktop by running it from my flash drive. I am planning to later dual boot Ubuntu alongside Microsoft Windows 7.\nWill the files on my external hard drive be deleted when I use it on Ubuntu (since I have already been saving files on it from Windows)? \n\nA: Solution:\nWant to keep all your data?:\nYou should install Ubuntu on a separate partition. The most important thing is you should create a separate partition for Ubuntu manually, and you should select it while installing Ubuntu.\nFirst create a separate partition for Ubuntu while running Windows (like a partition with more than 10 GB). Also create a small partition for the swap partition (size is equal to your RAM size).\n\n\n*\n\n*You should know the partition sizes you created so that you can identify them easily while installing Ubuntu.\n\n\nSee the below images - I picked them by googling so they won't be same as yours (like partition sizes and number of partitions).\nThe second important thing is while installing Ubuntu select \"Something else\".\n\nIt will allow you to select your manually created partition to install Ubuntu onto it.\nNow select and edit the partition you created for Ubuntu. Be careful in selecting. Check twice that you selected the correct partition, not some other partition as you may lose data like before.\n\nSelect the format partition, use as mount point as shown in the image. The size is up to you.\nAfter that, select the swap partition, and edit it as shown in the image (size is your choice).\n\nAfter that select the \"Device for boot loader installation\" at the bottom and select the one with /dev/sda at the beginning.\n\nNow you can select \"install now\" at the right bottom.\n\nA: While it shouldn't format the drive unless you manually tell it to do so, if you are paranoid you can physically remove the external drive [after unmounting] when you are using Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you don't want Ubuntu to install on the external drive, you can choose to install it next to Windows.  (The first option on the drive installation choice.)\nIt should never touch the external drive if you do that.\nYou can also install it on the external drive.  You may have to choose to resize the partition.  On a 1.5 TB external drive, with only a few hundred MB used, the process started and after a short said it would be finished in about 20 hours.\nI was successful and was able to boot Ubuntu from grub on the internal drive to the OS on the external drive.  Ubuntu was able to read both drives quite well.  I eventually installed it on the internal drive. It's faster that way. \nBTW, Ubuntu can read either partition, but Microsoft cannot read the Ubuntu partitions.  \n", "Q: How I can fix Audacious Crash on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr LTS? At first, the installation of Audacious 3.5.2 works pretty good but then it crashed with signal 5 in_XReply()\nHow I can fix this?\n\nA: Often crashes with programs can be hard to diagnose, as the problem may exist with the environment or the program itself. First step should be to check for known issues in the program in question. In order to help with troubleshooting, it may be a good idea to verify that you have all the required dependencies, as well as build the program from source and see if the newest release fixes the issue you are having.\nIf those do not result in your program being able to run, you can ask the developers, or clone their repo and investigate and make changes, then ask to push your changes upstream.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 14.04 - right click not working on touchpad - Acer V3-572G-75CA In my laptop touchpad it's not possible to get the right click action, neither by pressing the right button nor tapping the touchpad with two fingers.\nThe output of xinput is:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ ELAN0501:00 04F3:300B UNKNOWN             id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ HD WebCam                                 id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Acer WMI hotkeys                          id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nand the output of \"xinput list-props \"ELAN0501:00 04F3:300B UNKNOWN\" is\n    Device Enabled (136):   1\n    Coordinate Transformation Matrix (138): 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000\n    Device Accel Profile (260):     1\n    Device Accel Constant Deceleration (261):       2.500000\n    Device Accel Adaptive Deceleration (262):       1.000000\n    Device Accel Velocity Scaling (263):    12.500000\n    Synaptics Edges (264):  129, 3110, 126, 2221\n    Synaptics Finger (265): 25, 30, 0\n    Synaptics Tap Time (266):       180\n    Synaptics Tap Move (267):       175\n    Synaptics Tap Durations (268):  180, 180, 100\n    Synaptics ClickPad (269):       0\n    Synaptics Middle Button Timeout (270):  75\n    Synaptics Two-Finger Pressure (271):    282\n    Synaptics Two-Finger Width (272):       7\n    Synaptics Scrolling Distance (273):     79, 79\n    Synaptics Edge Scrolling (274): 1, 0, 0\n    Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling (275):   1, 0\n    Synaptics Move Speed (276):     1.000000, 1.750000, 0.050012, 0.000000\n    Synaptics Off (277):    2\n    Synaptics Locked Drags (278):   0\n    Synaptics Locked Drags Timeout (279):   5000\n    Synaptics Tap Action (280):     2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0\n    Synaptics Click Action (281):   1, 3, 0\n    Synaptics Circular Scrolling (282):     0\n    Synaptics Circular Scrolling Distance (283):    0.100000\n    Synaptics Circular Scrolling Trigger (284):     0\n    Synaptics Circular Pad (285):   0\n    Synaptics Palm Detection (286): 0\n    Synaptics Palm Dimensions (287):        10, 200\n    Synaptics Coasting Speed (288): 20.000000, 50.000000\n    Synaptics Pressure Motion (289):        30, 160\n    Synaptics Pressure Motion Factor (290): 1.000000, 1.000000\n    Synaptics Resolution Detect (291):      1\n    Synaptics Grab Event Device (292):      0\n    Synaptics Gestures (293):       1\n    Synaptics Capabilities (294):   1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0\n    Synaptics Pad Resolution (295): 32, 31\n    Synaptics Area (296):   0, 0, 0, 0\n    Synaptics Noise Cancellation (297):     19, 19\n    Device Product ID (255):        1267, 12299\n    Device Node (256):      \"/dev/input/event12\"\n\nI notice that the two button are not really separated from the touchpad (like in this photo).

Is there a way to disable the SSD Windows is on when using Ubuntu? I have a partition on the mechanical disk I intend to use for Ubuntu, and I don't want to see my SSD on Ubuntu once it's installed. So disabling my SSD for Ubuntu is what I'm getting at. Is there a way so it doesn't ruin each OS's drive functions?\n\nA: As long as you don't mount the partitions on your SSD, your Ubuntu system will not allow any modification to them, so there's really no action you should take aside from avoiding mounting those partitions, but since the volume label of mountable partitions is always present on the left menu of any nautilus' window, if you fear you could accidentally mount such partitions by clicking on their menu entry, you could hide them from nautilus' menu: in Disks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the SSD drive on the left menu\n\n*Select the first partition you want to hide on the right menu\n\n*Click on the icon showing two gears below the selected partition and choose \"Edit mount options\"\n\n*Toggle the \"Automatic mount options\" switch to \"Off\" if set to \"On\"\n\n*Untick \"Show in user interface\"\n\n*Repeat for each partition you wish to hide.\n\n", "Q: Virtualbox restart error I just installed Linux Mint 17.1 on my virtualbox4.3.22.

I read that terminal is nothing but shell, and Unix provides different flavors of shells:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bourne shell (sh)\n\n*C shell (csh)\n\n*TC shell (tcsh)\n\n*Korn shell (ksh)\n\n*Bourne Again shell (bash)\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I open a terminal window, which shell is opened by default?\n\n*How do I check how many shells are installed?\n\n*How do I change the shell used from my account?\n\n\nA: You can type the following command in your terminal to see which shell you are using:\necho $0\n\nThe result will look something similar to the below if you are using the bash (Bourne Again Shell) terminal:\n-bash\n\n\nA: $SHELL gives you the default shell.\n$0 gives you the current shell.\nFor example: I have bash as my default shell, which I use for my Terminal App. But for my iTerm2 app, I use the command as the window opens: /bin/ksh.\nSo my \n$0 gives me /bin/ksh on iTerm2.\n$SHELL gives me /bin/bash on iTerm2.\n$0,$SHELL gives me /bin/bash on Terminal\n\nA: The other answers tend to be using shell specific features, but we are trying to discover which shell we are using, so they assume the answer to the problem. For example none of the answers will work on fish.\nsh -c 'ps -p $$ -o ppid=' | xargs ps -o comm= -p\n\nInstead use the $$ syntax in an invocation of sh, but then we are looking for the PPID not the PID. Use the PPID to find the cmd.\nsh -c 'ps -p $$ -o ppid=' | xargs -I'{}' readlink -f '/proc/{}/exe'\n\nThanks for improvement @muru\n\nA: To address your third question, \"How do I change the shell used from my account?\", the answer is to use chsh.\nThere are two modes:\n\n*\n\n*interactive, and;\n\n*non-interactive.\n\nFrom Changing Shells - Changing your login shell which is permanent, and paraphrasing it slightly:\n\nYou will use a program called chsh. There is a interactive method\nand non-interactive method. Type the following into your terminal:\nINTERACTIVE METHOD\n$ chsh\n\nThis results in a brief dialog in which the user is prompted first for\ntheir password and then for the full path of the desired new shell.\nCaution should be exercised when changing one's default shell because\nit is possible to make an error that only the root user (i.e., system\nadministrator) can repair (although it should be easy for a skilled\nuser to repair it on a home system). In particular, it is important to\nfirst test the shell temporarily in the current session and then to\nmake certain that a valid shell name is being entered when making the\npermanent change.\nNON-INTERACTIVE METHOD\nI will use csh as again an example.\n$ chsh -s /bin/csh\n\nThe -s sets it for you without having to go into the editor to do\nit.\nOnce this is executed successfully, then echo $SHELL will still say\nthat you are in the same shell as before. However, you need to log out\nand back in for the change to take effect. Now do echo $SHELL. You\nshould see it shows the new shell.\n\n\nA: You may not want to know the current shell's name (e.g. -bash, bash, zsh, etc., from echo $0), nor default shell's executable path (from echo $SHELL), but rather the current shell's executable path (especially useful e.g. if you have more than one version of Bash installed).\nTo do this you can use lsof -p \"$$\" or with some extra coding to extract just the required info:\nlsof -p \"$$\" | grep -m 1 txt | xargs -n 1 | tail -n 1\n\nExample output for Bash installed via Homebrew:\n/usr/local/Cellar/bash/5.1.8/bin/bash\n\nor for Zsh:\n/bin/zsh\n\nThe above is different from echo $SHELL, both because the above is for the shell which is currently running rather than the user's default shell, and also because the above gives the executable after any symlinks have been expanded. E.g. for the same Bash install as above, echo $SHELL gives /usr/local/bin/bash.\nEDIT: If you need to allow for possible space characters in the shell's path, use lsof -p \"$$\" | grep -m 1 txt | xargs -n 1 | tail -n +9 | xargs instead.\n\nA: To find the shell you have on the default environment you can check the value of the SHELL environment variable:\necho $SHELL\n\nTo find the current shell instance, look for the process (shell) having the PID of the current shell instance.\nTo find the PID of the current instance of shell:\necho \"$$\"\n\nNow to find the process having the PID:\nps -p <PID>\n\nPutting it together:\nps -p \"$$\"\n\n\nA: The original post asked three questions. The answers given do cover the first question, \"When I open a terminal window, which shell is opened by default?\" They also answer a question which was NOT asked, namely \"How can I find out which shell is currently running in the terminal?\" However, as far as I can see nobody has answered either the second or third questions originally asked, namely \"How do I check how many shells are installed?\" and \"How do I change the shell used from my account?\"\n\n\n*\n\n*To answer \"How do I check how many shells are installed?\" the following command will list all the available shells:\ncat /etc/shells\n\nFor example, on a default installation of Ubuntu 18.10 this gives:\n# /etc/shells: valid login shells\n/bin/sh\n/bin/dash \n/bin/bash\n/bin/rbash\n\nHowever, by default sh is a symbolic link to dash, while rbash links to bash with the option -r (\"restricted bash\") so there are actually only two shells, not four as the above list suggests. The following command will show you whether any of the listed shells are in fact symbolic links, and if so where they link to:\nls -l /bin\n\n*Now for the question \"How do I change the shell used from my account?\" Assuming this means \"How do I permanently change the default shell that a terminal will use\", there is an answer here.\n\nA: To know which is the default shell for your user, you can run:\necho \"$SHELL\"\n\nFor example if you're using Bash you should get the following output:\n/bin/bash\n\nIf you didn't change any configuration it should be Bash since Bash it's the default shell on Ubuntu.\n\nA: In one of the servers I connect to, the login shell is /bin/sh which is a symlink to /bin/bash\nMost answers here will give sh, which would make the OP consider it's Bourne shell and not GNU bash, except this one that gives /bin/bash\nAnother option that works for this case is:\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/sh\n\n$ ls -l /bin/sh\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 May 31 16:15 /bin/sh -> bash\n\n$ /bin/sh --help\nGNU bash, version 4.2.10(1)\nUsage:  /bin/sh [GNU long option] [option] ...\n        /bin/sh [GNU long option] [option] script-file ...\n\n", "Q: Unable to boot from flash drive (Windows 8.1) I've been trying to boot Ubuntu from my flash drive on a windows 8.1 computer (asus x205ta).

The CMS connects to MySQL whenever someone connects to the site to get the page. However, I want to make a command run (yes, a normal GNU/Linux command, not a MySQL command) run whenever a database connection is made. I don't care if this means modifying a MySQL server setting or running a script on a forever loop that checks for database connections (which I am willing to do). How would I go about doing this? Thanks. (P.S. The system is running MySQL 5.5.)\n\nA: Probably there are better solutions, and i don't know if this would be an optimal solution for you, but one way to accomplish this would be to simply call shell_exec() after each mysqli_connect():\n$link = mysqli_connect('127.0.0.1', 'root', '', 'db');\nshell_exec('<command>');\n\n", "Q: How to lock down connecting to a specific WiFi I have a laptop what has WiFi on the motherboard, but it only supports 802.11a/b and WEP.

On-board devices should have an option to disable them.\n\n2) How can I set my USB wireless to connect using only a specific connection?\n\nConnections are only established with connection you provide a password for. If the guest network is strong and known it probably will pick this up. Dropping the password for it might be an option where you will need to manually input the password when you want to connect to it (and not safe the password).\nHere is a method of disabling network manager for a specific MAC address: How can I make NetworkManager ignore my wireless card? You should be able to use this to make the guest network \"un-managed\" so Network Manager ignores it (another one about this).\n\nA: \nHow can I disable the WiFi card on the motherboard?\n\nTemporarily: nmcli dev disconnect iface wlan0 (refer to man nmcli for explanation on that at the end)\nPermanently: Add line blacklist rtl8187 to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist (basically blacklist the driver for the wifi card , card cant work without driver)\n\nHow can I set my USB wireless to connect using only a specific connection?\n\nWhen you go to Edit Connections -> Edit  a connection -> Wifi tab, you have line with mac address and interface name. Your usb dongle is wlan1. Find all connections with that interface/mac address, remove them or uncheck \"connect automatically\", leaving only one desired connection\n", "Q: Enabling Java in Chrome on 32 bit 14.10 I am trying to run Runescape in Chrome (it has game.ws in its file address http://www.runescape.com/game.ws), and while I can run this game in Firefox I can't seem to run it in Chrome.

This will kill all processes and log you out. If this works, it should bring you to the login screen again.\n2) Use MagicSys Key to kill all processes\nIf the crash is so serious that Ctrl + Alt + Backspace have no effect at all, try pressing the MagicSysKey ‘Alt + SysRq + K’ to kill all processes. The MagicSysKey is a set of keyboard combination that allow the users to perform various low level commands regardless of the system’s state using the SysRq key. In case you are wondering where the SysRq key is, in most keyboard configuration, it is found under the Print Screen button. In some laptop configuration, you might have to press the ‘Fn‘ button to access the SysRq key.\nIn short, press Alt + SysRq (possibly together with the ‘Fn‘ button) + K to kill all processes.\n3) If all the above fail…\nTry this MagicSysKey combination. It will sure work.\nPress and hold Alt + SysRq, then one by one, press and release the following characters in the respective order: ‘R’ ‘E’ ‘I’ ‘S’ ‘U’ ‘B’. The system will perform a series of tasks and finally reboot the computer, safely.\nThis method should be used only if all other methods fail.

Change your command to following:\nscp -v -P 25000 nickeleres.tar.gz root@nickeleres.com:~\n\nAlso note that you are writing to the root's home directory, make sure you have the right permissions.

The '4 partitions' is talking about physical partitions - this can be extended by using 'logical partition', but you don't have to worry about that for now.\nWindows calls partitions drives, using letters to denote them, and \"simple volumes\" - these are all nonsense in the Linux world, drives are drives and partitions are partitions - segmented data within an actual drive. The actual system can be spread around these more-or-less freely, so as a user you no longer see drives as such.\nDelete your D: & F: drives & let the Ubuntu installer have the free space on the drive to install in, it will cope with keeping Windows in place (obviously, use the option to install alongside, not \"use the whole disk\") - the way you have it now, the installer is respecting at least 3 Windows drives & has nowhere left to go..\n\nA: Mark's answer is very good, but I would personally recommend using Gparted. It will let you see all of your partitions, and if you use it from a live CD or USB, you shouldn't have any errors. If you are new into linux (like me) it would be a good idea to burn Hiren's Boot CD to a CD, it has got many useful tools, and some partition managers amongst them. \nGoing back to the topic, from Gparted you can get a clear view of your hard drive, and therefore choose what's best. And about primary and logical, nevermind, it's not so important. \nIf you feel brave enough, try to get a separate home partition, to avoid copying back and forth for updates.\nAnd be sure to NOT create partitions for Linux from Windows, they don't get along well.\nAnd most of all, just enjoy learning and never leave Linux.\n", "Q: Connection refused from Ubuntu VM to Snappy Ubuntu Core VM My objective is to learn building and deploying Snappy packages/apps to Snappy Ubuntu Core platform.\nFor this on my MacBook Pro, using VMware Fusion virtualisation tool I set up two virtual machines; one with Ubuntu platform and the other one with Snappy Ubuntu Core platform.\nI can ping any VM from the other one using their VMware assigned static IP addresses without  problem.\nI have been following the simple example given here:\nhttps://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/\nEverything worked up to the point when I executed this command from hello-world sample package folder on my Ubuntu VM, in order to install the sample package on Ubuntu Core:\nsnappy-remote --url=ssh://xxx.xx.xxx.xxx:8022 install ./hello-world_1.0.5_all.snap\n\nwhere xxx.xx.xxx.xxx is the IP address of the snappy.\nThe error I received is this:\nInstalling ./hello-world_1.0.5_all.snap from local environment\nissues while running ssh command: ssh: connect to host xxx.xx.xxx.xxx port 8022: Connection refused\nlost connection\n\nI have been wrestling with SSH setup on the Snappy Ubuntu Core VM without much success in the past 5 hours.

I have to switch over to one of the tty and then back to tty7 in order to unfreeze it. How can I solve the problem? I use ubuntu 14.04 on Asus X552CL. (i3/4GB ram/1.8Ghz/1GB graphic card).\nI didn't face this problem earlier. However, it started occurring frequently since this week. \nMajor changes that I did this week are:\nInstall proprietary Nvidia graphic card. And play around wih compiz and emerald in order to install new themes.\nI don't know what's causing this problem. The OS freezes abruptly and frequently- keyboard and mouse doesn't respond. I have two options then: to force shutdown by hard pressing the power button for few secs, or switch into tty mode using ctrl + alt+ f1 (any of the function keys from f1 to f6). When I switch back to gui mode using f7, the OS unfreezes. But since this is happening very frequently, I need to solve it as soon as possible.\n\nA: DO NOT FOLLOW ANY ADVICE TO DELETE COMPIZ!\nI had the same problem after tweaking compiz.  Unfortunately I followed someone's advice to delete compiz and destroyed my installation.  The solution I found was to install Ubuntu again.  When I chose LVM to look at the layout, it wiped my drive without warning.  It is the only option that does not give a warning once you have continued after checking it.\nIf you originally partitioned the /home on a separate drive, I have been told you can select the same partition for /home on the new install without losing the current data and settings.  However, you may have some tweaking to do to get some apps to cooperate.\n\nA: There are a couple of reasons as for why this may be happening. When it comes to your desktop there are several layers that create your desktop. Most all of the flavors or distros all start with the X window system. After that, you will have your Display Manager, and your Window Manager then you will have the final product .. For instance. You have Cinnamon.. Cinnamon doesnt use the Display managers like FXCE or LXDE and KDE. it uses MUFFIN, which is a GTK+3 engine. and it works best with the LightDM display manager, Though Linux Mint itself also has the MDM & GDM Display managers that it can also use. Each one has its own bells and whistles. Personally i find that cinnamon works best with LightDM. \nAs i am sure you have figured out about us LINUX types, we LOVE to customize our rigs. but we also like our consistency throughout the build.  There is a few of us out there who happen to just like them all.. and unfortunately for us we cant just make a big super os with a little of KDE Plasma, and a Lil of the Arch, and a little of debian and some of that ubuntu and some Openbox or fluxbox and a whole bunch of Awesome.. because they dont all work together.. what im getting at is that, when you start mixxing some of the base components of one display manager with another and so forth.. things start to fall apart. If your enjoying the GDK stylings. then steer clear of things that venture into KDE or LXQT or XFCE.. thats when your UI starts to do the glitching and falling apart. \nalso sometimes you might just need to restart your DM, simple... Alt + Ctrl + Esc . is one way.. or you might need to restart your Xserver. that is done with Alt + Ctrl + Backspace  ... \nHope that helps a little bit. There are plenty of good comparison articles around for the DIfferences between KDE and XFCE or LX and Openbox etc.. a good sight to look at for help in finding alternatives is alternativeto.net \n", "Q: 'apt-get upgrade' vs 'apt-get install --only-upgrade' To this day I thought that using 'apt-get upgrade' keeps all my installed packaged to their latest version. Toady however, I realized that my 'deluged' package version is 1.3.6, while there's a newer 1.3.11. Using 'apt-get upgrade' didn't help, and then I found out that I can use 'apt-get install --only-upgrade', but that only works for a specific package.\nWhy didn't 'upgrade' do the job in my case? Is there a way to insure that all packages are upgraded?\nThanks!\n\nA: You want to use apt-get dist-upgrade for this. \nupgrade\nupgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages\ncurrently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in\n/etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new\nversions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no\ncircumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages\nnot already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of\ncurrently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without\nchanging the install status of another package will be left at\ntheir current version. An update must be performed first so that\napt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.\n\ndist-upgrade\ndist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,\nalso intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions\nof packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and\nit will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the\nexpense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade\ncommand may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file\ncontains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package\nfiles. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding\nthe general settings for individual packages\n\n", "Q: Copy an image of a disk to an external drive Is am trying to make a copy of a file structure (& an image) from a drive that I have identified as\n/dev/sda \n\n(Contains /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda5)\nThe drive identifying itself as /dev/sdc1 which is an external drive with 1.8TB, has 600+ Gigs of space left.

You can use cat or dd interchangeably for simple cases, I'll use cat here for brevity. You need to open a terminal as root (or use sudo -i)\ncat /dev/sda will stream your drive contents 'as is' to a pipe. > will direct that data stream to a second process or file; so if you specify a filename after this, the data will go there; so cat /dev/sda > mydrive.img will make a copy of the entire drive, boot, partition tables, everything.\nYou can remount a partition image as mkdir example ; mount mydrive.img example -o loop but this won't work for a whole drive; if we had used `/dev/sda1``above, it would. This works for .iso files.\nThere appears to be a confusion in your question between drives/partitions, eg /dev/sdc1, and mount places in your filesystem such as /home/mark/ - you don't want to be writing to an unmounted drive at all, you need /dev/sdc1 mounted somewhere (perhaps /media/mark/something?), so you can see the files within it, and create your image there.\nInsertion of a compression in the pipe (above) is simple; so my 'final answer' to your question above would be \ncat /dev/sda2 | gzip >/mount/mark/somedrive/sda2.img.gz\nYou can gunzip this & mount with loop at your leisure - you haven't overwritten anything, just created a new file, and can access your data.\n", "Q: Display 'cd' accessible path to mtp device in Nemo Nemo displays path to mtp device like that:\nmtp://[usb:001,007]/\n\nI want to be able to copy path from Nemo to terminal and cd there.

Take a look at my tutorial to learn on this and more:\nAsus Eee Pc X101ch and Intel Atom: Get A Suitable Video Playback!\nExtract from the post:\nThere is no available driver for this GPU. That means we can't use hardware graphics acceleration. But we can still get a much better video quality by installing another video player. We will install SMPlayer. We will also install MPV player. SMPlayer is a great MPV player front-end. Installing SMPlayer should also cause the installation of MPV (dependency).\nSo, we will install two packages\n\n\n*\n\n*SMPlayer\n\n*MPV\n\n\nFor example, run\nsudo apt install mpv smplayer\n\nNext, open SMPlayer and make sure you got the right \"MPlayer/mpv executable\" setting. Check this by opening Options > Preferences, go to General menu > General tab: you should read MPlayer/mpv executable: /usr/bin/mpv. It should be already set this way; if not, change it.\nNow, go to Options menu > Preferences and change these settings:\nGeneral > General\nEnable screenshots = false (unchecked)\nGeneral > Video\nOutput driver = x11\nStart videos in fullscreen = true (checked)\nGeneral > Audio Synchronization\nAudio/video auto synchronization = true (checked)\nAudio/video auto synchronization Factor = 100\nA/V sync correction = true (checked)\nA/V sync Max correction = 0,10  \nPerformance > Performance\nAllow frame drop = true (checked)\nThreads for decoding = 4\nUse core AVC... = true (checked)  \nNow, try it! Play some video file from your hard disk. Still not perfect? You will probably get much better results by pressing F to switch to full screen, if not already done. Now, there are (probably) no frames being skipped so the movement is fluid. Pretty good for such a small computer!\nFinally, go to: Start Menu > Preferences > Preferred Applications. Select Multimedia tab.

Does AMD play nice with Ubuntu now?\n\nA: The answer still isn't black and white. There are two different drivers (and soon a third that aims to superset both). There is still no clear winner between the two. Here's a snippet from the Arch wiki:\n\nThe open source driver is currently not on par with the proprietary driver in terms of 3D performance on newer cards or reliable TV-out support. It does, however, offer better dual-head support, excellent 2D acceleration, and provide sufficient 3D acceleration for OpenGL-accelerated window managers, such as Compiz or KWin.  \n\nWhich works best for you will likely still depend on your hardware and the applications you want to run. Expect it to be an iterative and occasionally frustrating process.\nIf you're asking about buying suggestions, I'd personally avoid them until they can deliver a driver that works. That is their aim but progress to date has been slow. If you want high performance and parity between Windows and Linux, you buy Nvidia. If you want a solid open driver stack (for KMS, Wayland, etc) you get something with an Intel IGP.\n", "Q: after apt-get upgrade monitors freeze whenever I change something in 'displays' If I open Displays and change anything, from resolution, to disabling or enabling one of the monitors, my monitors freeze as soon as I click Apply\nSometimes I can still see the mouse movements.

I have never used Linux based OS and looking forward to use Ubuntu. I want guidance on installing Ubuntu with Windows 8.2 as dual boot?\n\nA: Make a bootable USB-stick\nTo create a bootable USB drive the tool that I advocate using is the Universal USB Installer from www.pendrivelinux.com.\nPartition\nWindows takes up the whole of the drive when it is first installed. In order to install Ubuntu you will need to make space for it.\nPress the \"super key\" (Windows key) on your keyboard and click the magnifying glass in the top right corner. In the search box start typing \"Partitions\".\nClick on the option called \"Create and format partitions\". This will bring up the \"Disk Management\" screen.\nTo shrink the drive, right click on the \"OS (C:)\" volume and select \"Shrink volume\".\nA screen will appear showing how much you can shrink the drive by. You can of course choose to shrink the drive by less than offered but never go for any more than offered as you will break your Windows 8.1 operating system if you do.\nClick \"Shrink\" to continue.\nWhen you are finished you will see that there is a lot of unpartitioned space. This is where Ubuntu will be installed.\nFast Boot\nTo be able to boot to your Ubuntu USB drive you will need to turn off the fast boot option.\nPress the \"super\" key (Windows key) and then click the magnifying glass in the top right corner.\nEnter \"Control Panel\". Click on the \"Control Panel\" option that appears.\nWhen the \"Control Panel\" appears click on the \"System and Security\" heading.\nNow click on \"Power Options\".\nOn the following screen click on \"Choose what the power button does\".\nA screen will appear with the heading \"Define power buttons and turn on password protection\".\nScroll down until you see \"Shutdown Settings\".\nAn option should be available called \"Turn on fast startup\" (recommended).\nUncheck this option.\nClick \"Save Changes\".\nSecure Boot\nIn theory you don't need to turn off Secure Boot any more. In practise it is almost certain that you will.\nTurning off secure boot depends on the make and model of your computer as each one has slightly different methods for turning it off.\nBasically though click on the \"super\" key (Windows key) and then click on the power icon next to your user name.\nHold down the shift key on your keyboard and select restart computer. Keep the shift key held down until your computer reboots.\nYou will now have an option to go into your UEFI boot settings. \nWithin the UEFI settings look for the option to turn off secure boot. You don't have to switch to legacy mode and you shouldn't switch to legacy mode as this will not help your cause.\nSave and exit the UEFI settings\nInstall Ubuntu\nWhen you have turned off secure boot, save and reboot. You will probably end up back in Windows.\nNow at this point to boot into Ubuntu on the USB drive I had to again hold down the shift key whilst rebooting the computer. \nOne of the options that appeared let me boot from the USB drive into Ubuntu 14.04 live and you should have a similar option available to you.\nTo begin the installation double click on the \"Install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\" icon.\nThe first thing you need to do is decide which language you would like to use.\nUnless you feel like the challenge isn't great enough I would choose the language that you would normally use.\nClick \"Next\" to continue.\nThe next screen lets you choose which internet connection to use whilst installing Ubuntu.\nDo what you want...\nIf you have a good broadband connection you may wish to connect to it now so that you download updates as you go. This will slow down the initial install but will save time later on as you won't have to install lots of updates.\nWhen you click \"Next\" you will be shown a tick list highlighting how prepared you are for installing Ubuntu.\nClick \"Continue\".\nIn the past there used to be an option on the \"Installation Type\" screen to install alongside Windows.\nIf you are installing alongside Windows 7 on a non-EFI based system then you will still have that option.\nClick on \"Something Else\" and click \"Next\".\nThe next screen show the partition table on your computer.\nBe very careful with the next few steps. \nIf you haven't taken that Windows backup, quit the installation, reboot and follow step 1 of this tutorial again.\nYou will see a large portion of free space, this is from the shrinking before. This is where I put Ubuntu.\nThe free space is going to be split into 3.\nThe first partition is for Ubuntu and will be 50 Gigabytes in size. (Examples size)\nThe second partition is for your home partition and stores configuration files and your personal files such as music, pictures etc.\nThe third partition is for swap space and is used for intensive operations and suspending the computer.\nWhen you have found the partition with free space, click on it and press the plus symbol (+) under the disk layout.\nIn the size box enter 50000, select logical as the partition type, select beginning of this space and choose EXT4 as the file system.\nFor the mount point choose / (this means root).\nClick \"OK\".\nThe disk layout screen should now show a new partition for /.\nFind the large section of free space again, click on it and press the plus symbol again (+).\nThis time you want to set the size to be the rest of the free disk space minus 2x the amount of memory in your computer.\nIf you have 8 gigabytes RAM, subtract 16 gigabytes.\nAgain choose \"Logical\" as the partition type, beginning of this space for where to put the partition and EXT4 as the file system.\nFor the mount point choose /home.\nThe issue of how much swap space to use is constantly up for debate. Some people say you don't need any at all, some go for 1.5 times the amount of RAM and some say 2x.\nUnless disk space is at a premium I would just go for the 2x and have done with it.\nIn theory if you are running lots of intensive processes such as video editing then the swap space is used to store memory that isn't currently being used (swapped) to disk. This is disk intensive and slows down your computer but it will help to prevent a crash. Swap space is also used for suspending your computer.\nNow find the free disk space again, click on it and press the plus symbol. (+).\nLeave the size as the rest of the free disk space, choose logical as the file system and beginning of this space as the location.\nChoose \"swap area\" as the mount point.\nThe final thing to concern yourself with when partitioning is where to install the boot loader.\nBy default it is set to /dev/SDA on the \"Installation Type\" screen. This can be changed but unless you are using multiple disks you should leave this well alone.\nPress \"Install Now\" to continue.\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: Get a disk image of ubuntu (.iso file), and put it on a USB drive using win32diskimager or Unetbootin.\nThen boot the the USB drive and follow the instructions given.\nFrom there u can choose the amt. of space you want to give to each OS and also if you want some space for a swap\n", "Q: rsync how to send folder contents but not folder itself Currently I have the following command which will send a folder and it's contents recursively:\nrsync -avz --ignore-existing --recursive /var/-iles/_site root@mytestingdomain.com:/var/www\n\nWhat I want is only the contents of folder _site to be sent to folder www\n, not the _site folder itself. \nIs it possible to send only the contents of folder _site via rsync?\nThanks\n\nA: This can be done using shell globbing:\nrsync -avz --ignore-existing --recursive /var/-iles/_site/* root@mytestingdomain.com:/var/www/\n\nAll the contents of the /var/-iles/_site/ directory will be copied to the destination.\n", "Q: Lost everything while installation I followed an online tutorial!

Yes, I know I Should have created a back up but I did not. My system is a laptop. How can I retrieve my Lost data from this partition?\n\nA: \n\"Clean disk and install ubuntu, this will delete your files and programs in all your operating systems\"\n\nYou understood that this means you told the system to remove Windows? You probably need to consider that the data is gone forever. \nPossible things that could save you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore a backup. Very simple reasoning: if you have important data on a disk you make backups of that data. If your OS has a problem you re-install that OS and then restore your backup. If you do not have a backup you do not yell at other people for you wrecking your system. \n\n*If you did NOTHING with your system after installing Ubuntu you might get away with it with a problem called testdisk. Here is a guide on this.\nGood luck with this. And I am serious with the \"nothing\": if you used Ubuntu and started installing software in sectors where Windows used to be you will corrupt the files you want to restore. \nWarning: you need to do this from a LIVE DVD. Not from your current installation. \nFocus on restoring your personal data and not on getting a complete Windows.\n", "Q: VLC doesn't start, says bus error (core dumped) This is what happens:\n~ $ vlc\nVLC media player 2.2.0-pre2 Weatherwax (revision 2.2.0-pre1-15-g5178b24)\n[00000000017db118] core libvlc: Running vlc with the default interface.

In the past it could freeze from time to time. I move around with the laptop, so at home and work I use a dual screen but in the train (from home to work and back). I don't have the external display. ;-) Now every time I connect/disconnect the external display unity freezes.\nMy solution Ctrl+Alt+F1:\nsetsid unity\n\nThis allows Unity to be responsive again, but I miss the menu bar. Then I open a terminal in Unity and put again\nsetsid unity\n\nand it works till the next time I unplug/plug the dual screen.\nI'm also thinking to move away from unity, but I need to find a good desktop that looks nicely with dual screens of very different resolutions.\n\nA: I found a workaround.\nI created two scripts (one of them I found it on this website, but now I lost the link).\nLet's called the first script: \"discover_session_bus_address.sh\"\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Remember to run this script using the command \"source ./filename.sh\"\n\n# Search these processes for the session variable \n# (they are run as the current user and have the DBUS session variable set)\ncompatiblePrograms=( nautilus kdeinit kded4 pulseaudio trackerd )\n\n# Attempt to get a program pid\nfor index in ${compatiblePrograms[@]}; do\n   PID=$(pidof -s ${index})\n    if [[ \"${PID}\" != \"\" ]]; then\n        break\n    fi\ndone\nif [[ \"${PID}\" == \"\" ]]; then\n    echo \"Could not detect active login session\"\n    return 1\nfi\n\nQUERY_ENVIRON=\"$(tr '\\0' '\\n' < /proc/${PID}/environ | grep \"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\" | cut -d \"=\" -f 2-)\"\nif [[ \"${QUERY_ENVIRON}\" != \"\" ]]; then\n    export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=\"${QUERY_ENVIRON}\"\n    echo \"Connected to session:\"\n    echo \"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=${DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS}\"\nelse\n    echo \"Could not find dbus session ID in user environment.\"\n    return 1\nfi\n\nreturn 0\n\nSave it an then, in the same folder, create another script called \"recover_unity.sh\".\nCode:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nsource ./discover_session_bus_address.sh unity\nunity &\n\nsave it and give both script execution permissions:\n    chmod +x discover_session_bus_address.sh\n    chmod +x recover_unity.sh\nNow, every time unity freezes, use CTRL+ALT+F1, login and, within the folder where those scripts were saved, type\nsource recover_unity.sh\n\n\nA: Ok, this is my final solution:\nI removed all the suspicious PPAs from my repository using ppa-purge (sudo apt-get install ppa-purge)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa \n\njust in case you had disabled the ppa before\nsudo apt-get update \n\n(idem)\nsudo ppa-purge  ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa \n\nI don't remember if this is necessary or if ppa-purge already does this)\nthen the same with ppa ppa:bumblebee/stable\nthen \nsudo apt-get purge xserver-xorg*\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nthen\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331\nsudo reboot\n\nafter reboot, not only everything works perfectly (plugin or unplugging the external monitor, suspending, etc) but the hardware graphic acceleration is faster than ever!

That is intended for hosting a website.\nIf you only need a database you can install MySQL. But that might be overkill too. There is also SQLite (it is a \"light\" database and I would opt for that).\nMySQL:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nSQLite:\nsudo apt-get sqlite\n\n\nSQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.

It is perfectly possible to install both. See Is it possible to install OpenOffice and LibreOffice in parallel?\nBoth might want to use the symlink /usr/bin/soffice as a shortcut (and you can only have 1 of those at the same time) but that is easily solved by manually changing the target. \n\nThe development in the past year has been very high on Libre Office. Open Office was not maintained for about 3 years, got hardly any updates (if any) and when Libre Office got forked (due to licensing concerns) a group of volunteers started adding new code like crazy (see for instance Why is LibreOffice default instead of OpenOffice.org for a list of concerns). They probably made a mistake somewhere where it concerns these 2 fonts/the 2 unicode ranges.\n\n\nOr why is LibreOffice Writer not as unrestricted like OpenOffice Writer concerning fonts' display?\n\nI do not understand this question. What is it you are asking?! I do not get what you mean with \"unrestricted\". To me this is a bug. Bugs happen. Well not in Open Office but that is due to the fact it does not get updates... \nThe link you point to concerns a possible bug filed today (it is not even yet accepted as a bug and is in the \"need info\" stage) and it is specifically targeted against 2 fonts (\"Ahuramazdanew\" and \"AhuramazdaPlusTranslit\") where 1 of them is not even released. Or in a broader view against unicodes ranges hex-10b00 to hex-10b3f \nand from hex-10b78 to hex-10b7f (from the link). Seems a problem that has a rather low impact. \nAnd seeing how quick a lot of things get picked up by the Libre Office maintainers I would expect this to be addressed quickly too.\n", "Q: Is it possible to specify default images for scopes?

The way the scope reads these by default leaves a space or an area marked X for the lack of image. Is there a way I can specify that, say, the logo be used by default?\n\nA: No, there is no way to provide a fallback image URL to the dash for display, through the scopes API currently.\nYou can however, have your scope download the images, and pass local file:/// URIs to the dash for the image location, replacing any which were not usable with a URI pointing to the fallback image you wish to use instead.\n", "Q: WiFi randomly turning off or disconnecting (lenovo t540p, Ubuntu 14.04) I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my lenovo t540p.\nEverything is working good, however, the wireless keeps turning off or disconnecting from time to time.\nThis is my iwconfig:\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11abgn  ESSID:\"tanquetao\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.437 GHz  Access Point: 14:CF:E2:0D:88:30   \n          Bit Rate=144.4 Mb/s   Tx-Power=22 dBm   \n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:on\n          Link Quality=44/70  Signal level=-66 dBm  \n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:66  Invalid misc:1324   Missed beacon:0\n\nI would appreciate if anybody had some advice on how to fix this issue.\n\nA: Disable Power Management\n\n\n*\n\n*Bring interface down.\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\n\n\n*Disable Power Management.\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 power off\n\n\n*Bring the interface up again.\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n\n\n*If it works, make it permanent by putting it into script or through pm-utils.\nDisable n\nIf you have intel type of wireless card, you might want to try disabling n-wireless.\n", "Q: Ubuntu does not load after successfull installation I have Windows installed on my pc on partition (C), then I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on another partition.

How can I expand/resize my extended partition (sda3) with unallocated free space to the left of it? I want this to be able to expand my / partition (sda5).\n\n\nA: You only can resize (except expanding by moving the right border; depending on the file system) partitions that are unmounted.\nEvery partition that is in use by your system is mounted. You can see it in gParted when there is this key symbol right to the partition name.\nSo you have to unmount the partitions inside the extended partition (sda5, sda6, sda7) and then the extended partition (sda3) itself. This is done by selecting \"unmount\" in the context menu of the partition in gParted.\nBut stop! Ubuntu will not allow you to unmount the partitions it is running from. Therefore, you have to boot your PC from a live medium (e.g. Ubuntu installation DVD) and run gParted inside this live sessions, where no hard disk partitions are mounted.\nNote that partitioning is always dangerous and can lead to data loss or errors at boot time. So make sure your backups are valid and up to date!\n\nA: First backup your data. Any time you resize you run a risk of losing data. \nSince you can't resize a mounted partition, Boot from a Live media, Open a terminal and issue the command sudo swapoff -a to insure the swap partition on the drive you are working with isn't in use. Run sudo gparted or gksu gparted.\nRight-click your extended partition and choose Resize/Move. Move it to the left to utilize the 7.81 GB of space you have available there. \nWhen you have your desired result click the green check mark to apply your changes. \nYou'll also want to Resize it to the Right to actually expand the amount of space available in the partition.  Again, When you have your desired result click the green check mark to apply your changes. \nFollow up by moving and expanding your sda5 partition as you desire using  the same process.

Thanks, little nervous proceeding is all.\n\nA: Solution:\nTwo options here\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu in a HDD with another Operative System.\n\n*Install Ubuntu in a HDD which have data.\n\n\n 1. Install Ubuntu in a HDD with another Operative System:\nStart by going to ubuntu.com. On the homepage, scroll down and click the red \"Get Ubuntu Now\" button.\n\nUnder \"Ways to get Ubuntu\", select \"Download and Install\".\n\nThis will take you to a page where you can choose which version of Ubuntu you want to download and then download it. You need to download the right version of Ubuntu for your computer, 32 bit or 64 bit. 64-bit is much faster then 32-bit if your computer can support it. While in windows, open the Start Menu. Right-click on the word \"Computer\" and click Properties.\n\nIn the window that opens, under the system category, note the \"system type\". If the type is listed as 32-bit operating system, select the 32-bit option from the dropdown menu on ubuntu.com, then click Start Download. If your system is 64-bit, select the 64-bit option from the dropdown and click \"Start Download\".\n\nOnce the ISO file has finished downloading, open Windows Explorer and find the downloaded file. It should be in your \"Downloads\" folder unless you chose to save it somewhere else. Once you locate the file, right click on it, click the \"Open With...\" option and then select \"Windows Disc Image Burner\".\n \nMake sure you have the right CD burner selected, and that the \"Verify Disc After Burning\" box is checked. Click burn, go get a cup of coffee, and come back.\nOnce the disc has finished burning, eject the disc and shutdown the computer. Put the disc into the drive and press the power button. Now, you'll notice that somewhere on the screen displaying your computer manufacturer's logo, usually off in a corner of the screen some text saying which key you need to press to enter additional boot options. \nOn my computer, which is an  HP laptop, it says \"ESC Pause Startup\". On some computers is F12 or F2 or ESC, etc. and the key you have to press varies from computer to computer. Once you know what key to press, press that key before the computer reaches the \"Starting Windows\" screen. The screen that you reach will very from computer to computer, in my case the screen looks like this:\n\nSome computers will enter directly into computer setup, some will provide you with an option to boot from the CD or DVD drive without changing settings in the BIOS. The process to get a computer to boot from the CD or DVD drive varies greatly from computer to computer, but is relatively straightforward. Refer to the documentation for your computer on the manufacturer's website if you need any additional assistance.\nWhen you get the computer to successfully boot from the CD containing Ubuntu, you should first get a screen with a stick figure and a keyboard. Press any key at this point to change the installer language, otherwise, to leave it to the default English, don't press anything. After that for several minutes, depending on the speed of your CD/DVD drive and of your computer, you should see a screen like this:\n\nBe patient while the computer loads Ubuntu from the CD. When the loading has completed, you should arrive at a screen similar to the one below:\n\nOnce this screen has loaded, click \"Install Ubuntu\". The next screen:\n\nBe sure that all the requirements are met. If you need to connect through Wi-Fi because you want to be able to download updates during the installer, saving you the need to update afterwards, then use the Wifi Menu in the top left corner of the screen.\nIn the next screen, you can select weather or not you want to dual boot, since you do, select \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\". Click Forward.\n\nYou can then select how much space you want to devote to Ubuntu by clicking and draging the separator. When done, click \"Install Now\".\n\nThe rest of the installer is very self explanatory. It will guide you through naming your computer and creating a new user account, as well as giving you the option to import settings and files from your windows account. Have fun with your new Ubuntu installation!\n 2. Install Ubuntu in a HDD which have data:\nWant to keep all your data?:\nYou should install Ubuntu on a separate partition. The most important thing is you should create a separate partition for Ubuntu manually, and you should select it while installing Ubuntu.\nFirst create a separate partition for Ubuntu while running Windows (like a partition with more than 10 GB). Also create a small partition for the swap partition (size is equal to your RAM size).\n\n\n*\n\n*You should know the partition sizes you created so that you can identify them easily while installing Ubuntu.\n\n\nSee the below images - I picked them by googling so they won't be same as yours (like partition sizes and number of partitions).\nThe second important thing is while installing Ubuntu select \"Something else\".\n\nIt will allow you to select your manually created partition to install Ubuntu onto it.\nNow select and edit the partition you created for Ubuntu. Be careful in selecting. Check twice that you selected the correct partition, not some other partition as you may lose data like before.\n\nSelect the format partition, use as mount point as shown in the image. The size is up to you.\nAfter that, select the swap partition, and edit it as shown in the image (size is your choice).\n\nAfter that select the \"Device for boot loader installation\" at the bottom and select the one with /dev/sda at the beginning.\n\nNow you can select \"install now\" at the right bottom.\n\nInformation taken from answers here and here.\n\n", "Q: How to automatically set the pdf title tag with the file name?

How can I solve this issue?\nEdit:\nThe same question was asked here without any answer:\nMySQL Workbench GUI problems in Ubuntu 14.10\n\nA: UPDATE:\nThis multiple menu problem is fixed in mysql workbench version 6.3.3. I installed the new version found here:\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/\nI installed the following version Ubuntu Linux 14.10 (x86, 64-bit), DEB.\nNOTE: Am am running Ubuntu 15.04. However, I installed the 14.10 version and it works just fine.\n:END UPDATE\nIf you look closely, the menu is not actually doubled. It is actually two separate menus. The first menu is specific to the MySQL Connections home page. The second menu is specific to your open database connection. For example, if you open mysql-workbench, at first you'll only see one menu. Then, if you open a database connection and display an SQL worksheet, the second menu is displayed.\nI would probably classify this as a bug because of the redundancy of the two separate menus. However, if you'd like to change the menus, you certainly do so by editing the XML for them here: /usr/share/mysql-workbench/data/main_menu.xml.\nOne way to do this is to run:\nsudo nano /usr/share/mysql-workbench/data/main_menu.xml\n\n\nA: This answer by Milosz Bodzek solved my problem.\nHis solution was to put export UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 at the top of the mysql-workbench script file.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 won't shut down, reboots instead (on Asrock) I've researched on this topic and tried all of the recommendations such as editing kernel options acpi=off, acpi=noirq, acpi=force, then sudo update-grub.

It says there that you should enable keyboard and mouse power on. Now the reboot on shutdown is fixed. \n\nA: You have forgot to shut down one or more programs that you had running. I have the same problem with you and i find out that the Psensor was open when i was trying to shut down my pc. When i shut down Psensor the problem was solved.\n", "Q: Can I restore windows 8? If I install Ubuntu over windows 8, and have a backup restore point or something, is it possible to go back to windows 8? I have a netbook, and it's not quite big enough to dual boot, and I don't want to install Ubuntu and be stuck trying to pay to get windows 8 back if I needed to. I do have another computer for most of my windows stuff, but its on vista which might be a bit outdated for some things I need, I'm just trying to improve the functionality (mainly boot time and speed) of this computer.\n\nA: use the live disc and select 'Try Ubuntu'. If it works fine then you can permanently install it and replace windows 8. \n\nA: I you remove / replace Windows, that will remove it & it's restore points as well, so no.. \nI have a netbook & it dual boots very nicely, you could upgrade your HDD perhaps? Or, you could add a USB drive with the Linux OS on that, you're tied to having the drive but it's an easy upgrade.\nIf you have a lot of data you'd want to access from both OS's you could create another FAT32 partition & access it from both, saving duplication & space.\nYou could take a disk image of Windows, replace it altogether, & revert from the back-up image if you wanted - this would be mountable from an external drive, so you could access data within it. The details have been answered elsewhere - like here.\n", "Q: Where do I put my website php files in my virtual ubuntu server? I am trying to create a website through my ubuntu. I also intend to host this website on my ubuntu. I am goign to use dreamweaver for my php files and then put those php files in my ubuntu server. \nWhat I don't know is :\n\n\n*\n\n*Where do I put these files in ubuntu ?\n(Assuming I have to create the files in ubuntu, how do I save them ? what commands do I use ? where do I save them?)\n\n\nthank you. \n\nA: By default, after installing apache2 the website root is located under:\n/var/www/\n\nor\n/var/www/html/\n\n(depending on the Ubuntu version you installed).\nSo, in order to test your php, you'll need to move them to that location and set the correct ownership. Again, with apache, the file owner should be the system user www-data. Asuming your file is called yourfile.php you'll use these commands:\nsudo cp yourfile.php /var/www/html/\nsudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/yourfile.php\n\nThen, just open your browser and direct it to http://localhost/yourfile.php to see if it's working properly.\n", "Q: Track Network Usage in Wifi Connection I'm a student staying at a communal residence of 6 people and the rent includes internet access which is supposedly uncapped but if you really push your downloads(lets say more than 300GB) the ISP cancels your connection for the rest of the month. I have to do a lot online tutorial for my course so I can't afford to be a week without internet ... So here is my question is there a program that I can easily use to see how much traffic each person is using(I don't want to see what anyone is searching or violate their privacy. I just want know how much data each house mate is using so i can tell them to easy it down a bit.)I don't have the admin password for the router and i am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Thank You.\n\nA: You can try using this program Traffic monitor applet for GNOME\nThe only easy solutions is that each player has installed this applet, and have a look every week.\nThere'are professional solutions as a netflow analizers for accounting all of your traffic, but isn't easy solution. In all of cases you will need a server, and I think isn't a communal residence solution.\n", "Q: intel-virtual-output freezes I have been successfully running a triple-monitor setup with my ThinkPad W530.\nSuddenly at some point within the last days the command stopped working though and freezes.\nI would activate the monitor(s) using the thinkdisp indicator (roughly equivalent to running modprobe bbswitch and optirun true) and then run intel-virtual-output.

I don't understand what used is and what %MEM is. \ntop - 11:15:04 up  1:15,  4 users,  load average: 2.12, 1.52, 1.18\nTasks: 230 total,   2 running, 228 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\n%Cpu(s): 27.6 us,  0.2 sy,  0.0 ni, 72.1 id,  0.1 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st\nKiB Mem:   7861188 total,  6516808 used,  1344380 free,    95792 buffers\nKiB Swap:        0 total,        0 used,        0 free.  3697392 cached Mem\n\n  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND                                                                                                                                  \n 2753 arthur    20   0 1320032 1.121g   6732 R 100.0 15.0  58:35.05 svd_all_ri_clus                                                                                                                          \n 3481 arthur    20   0 1261924 222324  22736 S   4.0  2.8   0:08.09 chrome                                                                                                                                   \n 3512 arthur    20   0 1232108 204356  22396 S   2.3  2.6   0:06.60 chrome                                                                                                                                   \n 2461 arthur    20   0  666052  25800  13436 S   1.7  0.3   0:06.95 gnome-terminal                                                                                                                           \n 1343 root      20   0  393284  83852  74748 S   1.3  1.1   0:11.93 Xorg                                                                                                                                     \n 2208 arthur    20   0 1332004 101584  32700 S   0.7  1.3   0:18.16 compiz                                                                                                                                   \n 3345 arthur    20   0 1506568 124560  59936 S   0.7  1.6   0:10.73 chrome                                                                                                                                   \n 3411 arthur    20   0  785080 108416  19364 S   0.7  1.4   0:06.34 chrome                                                                                                                                   \n   10 root      20   0       0      0      0 S   0.3  0.0   0:00.19 rcuos/2                                                                                                                                  \n 1177 root      20   0   30608   2752   2144 S   0.3  0.0   0:00.12 wpa_supplicant                                                                                                                           \n 1937 arthur    20   0  361956   4328   2884 S   0.3  0.1   0:02.93 ibus-daemon                                                                                                                              \n 2007 arthur    20   0  480028  15864  10876 S   0.3  0.2   0:00.88 ibus-ui-gtk3                                                                                                                             \n 3047 root      20   0       0      0      0 S   0.3  0.0   0:00.26 kworker/u16:0    \n\nJust in case someone says read the man page, I already did (skimmed through it).\nDoes not appear to explain the difference between \"used\" and the sum total of what is listed under %MEM.\n 2c.

So now, I have no idea how to overcome this issue,  and install NetworkX in both \"dist_package\" folders. \nWhat are possible solutions for situation?

I think it was under Keyboard > Shortcuts > Esperanto circumflexes. \nIn Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) this seems to have disappeared.\nWhere is it in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)?\n\nA: If all you want to do is add ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭ (and the capital versions) to your keyboard in the third (and fourth) positions, i.e., altgr+c=ĉ, shift+altgr+c=Ĉ, you can edit a file in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols. You want to edit the file for the country whose keyboard you use, so for me it would be /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us. (You will have to edit the file using sudo.)\nYou can assign up to four characters per key (normal, 1 ; shift, ! ; altgr, ¡ ; shift+altgr, ¹).\nSo for example, in the us file you would change\nkey <AB03> { [ c, C ] }\n\nto\nkey <AB03> { [ c, C, ccircumflex, Ccircumflex ] }\n\nThe syntax remains the same: jcircumflex Jcircumflex, etc. And the accent on ŭ is a breve accent, so change that one to ubreve and Ubreve.\nWhen you are done you will have to cd /var/lib/xkb/ and sudo rm *.xkm and then reboot or just log out and back in.\nThere is likely a more simple way to do what you want, but I know this way works, since it's a part of how I made my own (ridiculously) modified keyboard layout.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) doesn't connect to wireless networks I'm using 6-7 years old LG MB500, just installed Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn), and I can't connect to my school network (WPA-WPA2 ENTERPRISE,TLS, MSCHAPv2, no CA certificate).\nThe computer displays all the available networks, but when I try to connect to any, it just disconnects after trying for a few minutes.\nI tried system-ca-certs=false, but it didn't work either.

This might be a problem if your new system has a different graphics board, just to start.\nBut you can allways try the disk on the new laptop and see what happens (as long as you backup first).\nPersonally, I put all the files I really need on a service like Dropbox, this way even if I loose the disk, I just have to install Dropbox and all my files get copied to disk again.\n", "Q: Locked out of Ubuntu 14.04 account after moving /home to a different partition I moved all my data in /home to a different partition and deleted (foolishly) all my old /home data.

Here is what to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the requirements\nTo build and install the driver, we need the kernel headers and the build tools like gcc. \nIf you have any sort of connection, download them from terminal by using:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nOtherwise, download them from some other place and use some media to get them on computer.\n\n*Get the driver\nNow, go to the official download page from Realtek for the Linux/UNIX Driver for the RTL8111/RTL8168 ethernet card and download the latest driver version from the Realtek Download Page\n\n*Untar the archive\nThe driver is compressed to an archive. So uncompress it with the following command:\ntar xfvj r8168-8.025.00.tar.bz2\n\nNOTE: Please do not forget to replace the r8168-8.025.00.tar.bz2 with the driver version you have downloaded!\n\n*Blacklist old driver\nWe have to blacklist the old driver (r8169) to prevent the system to load it. To do this, easily set a new entry in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf which will say:\nblacklist r8169\n\nor just enter in the terminal\necho \"blacklist r8169″ | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n\n*Build and install the new driver\nNow, the whole requirements to install the new driver are done. Let us now change in the driver directory, which we have uncompressed in a few steps before:\ncd r8168-8.025.00\n\nNOTE: Again, please do not forget, to change r8168-8.025.00 to the version you downloaded.\nThe only thing we have to do now is, to build the driver and install it. To build it, just type:\nmake clean modules\n\nafter a few seconds (depending on your CPU), the driver is built and you can install it with:\nsudo make install\n\n\n*Welcome r8168\nWe need to let the system know about the r8168 driver. With the command\ndepmod -a\n\nyou rebuild the kernel module dependencies and with an\nsudo modprobe ./src/r8168.ko\n\nyou insert the new kernel module (the driver) into the kernel.\n\n*Make it available for boot\nTo always use the new module, you have to make a new initrd boot file.

Here we make the initrd file with the help of the uname -r command, which allows us to get the version of the actually running kernel.\nOtherwise, you could add the module to /etc/modules: simply add a line r8168 to get the driver automatically loaded after boot. You can do this with only one command:\necho \"r8168″ | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\nAfter the reboot you can check if the right driver is loaded with this command:\nlspci -v\n\nwith this command you should find your RTL8111/RTL8168 network card in a list and the additional line Kernel driver in use: r8168.\nGuide has been taken from this page.\n", "Q: delete folder from trash in Ubuntu I delete folder from trash folder by mistake, but I want to retrieve it? \n I am using Ubuntu 14.10\nis there any way to retrieve it again\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: First, you should stop using the drive or partition. \nNext, login from another partition, or from a live disk and have an extra flash drive handy to transfer the lost data to.\nFinally, you can use photorec to recover different types of files.

Now I would like to access them from my client (Linux, Mac, Windows). What would be the best way to do that? Are there any ready-to-use solutions for that in Ubuntu?\n\nA: That would depend on how the cameras are configured, what program is running them, and what you are using them for. How are the cameras set up? Could you elaborate please? \nFor instance, I have debian server with a logictech webcam plugged into USB that I use for security surveillance reasons. In my case, I use program motion to view the camera stream. I access the camera stream via the motion web interface. By default, it only listens on the localhost. So you can either use iptables to allow connections from your local network to the web stream port, or you could use local port forwarding:\nFor example, if you are running motion or zoneminder and the server is listening on port 9000, you could do something like this:\nssh -L 8080:localhost:9000 user@yourserver\n\nThis command translates to forward port 9000 on the remote machine to port 8080 on the local (client) machine. Than you could open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080 and access the stream there.\nOr you could allow incoming connections to that port with something like:\nufw allow to any port 9000 proto tcp from 192.168.1.1/24\n\nThere are no 'ready made' solutions that I know of, as different webcams use different drivers, programs, etc. Zoneminder is a great way to manage multiple camera streams, but it's more useful for security system environments. So what are you using the cameras for, exactly?\n", "Q: I am not the owner of my external drive On the command line I read root@luis-NH4CU53:~#, and my external HD is recognized, but I cannot make any changes to it because it's properties says root is the owner. You are not the owner, so you cannot change these permissions. \n\nA: If you are going to use sudo with graphical applications, such as nautilus, than you really ought to use gksudo. I don't have enough rep to comment, but this is important because it is a security risk to run graphical programs with normal sudo, so thought I'd mention that. A better approach would be to open a terminal and navigate to the mountpoint, probably somewhere like /media/$user/device , and than run ls -l to figure out the permissions. \nRegarding the original question, what kind of file system is the external drive formatted to? You can find out by running as root fdisk -l I have had this problem before with a VFAT partition. Even when logged in as root I could not write to the partition. Sometimes this can be caused by corruption on the disc or partition, it's very frustrating.\nI am still looking for an answer to the VFAT no write access issue myself. \n\nA: Use the following command in terminal.\nsudo nautilus\n\nAnd enter your password.\nThis will open file manager with root permissions.\nNow you may access your external hdd and make changes to it.\nNote : Don't close terminal until you are finished making changes to hdd\n\nA: One thing to check: Make sure you're not viewing the folder through the admin:// protocol. It looks like this in the breadcrumbs of the Files app (nautilus):\n\nIf it shows \"Administrator Root\", press Ctrl+L and remove the text admin:// at the start of the address, leaving one slash (/media/...), and hit Enter.\nIt should now show \"Computer\" as the first item:\n\nThe admin protocol can cause permissions errors and warnings when accessing files and folders you normally have access to; I don't know what causes it to rear its head, but that's how you chop it off.\n", "Q: Struggling to get Kodi running on Ubuntu Server 14.04.2 I've just finished building a new machine and installed Ubuntu Server 14.04.2 LTS (typical install from USB flash drive). I'm currently having issues trying to get Kodi up and running (I suspect) thanks to Server's general lack of graphics support..\nThe machine in question has:\n\n\n*\n\n*Asus M5A78L-M/USB3\n\n*AMD Phenom II x6 1100T\n\n*Onboard Radeon HD3000 series (RS780L)\n\n\nTo summarise what I've tried so far, after working through numerous tutorials and guides, I am at a stage where attempting to launch Kodi shows the following output:\nError: unable to open display\nKodi needs hardware accelerated OpenGL rendering.\nInstall an appropriate graphics driver.\n\nFor the graphics side, I attempted the steps covered here, but although the AMD variation would require xserver-xorg-video-amd instead of the Intel package the guide uses, I get the following message:\nPackage xserver-xorg-video-and is not available, but is referred to by another package.\n\nRunning lspci -nn | grep VGA shows one entry:\n01:05.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

All my search results looking for answers are now turning up pages I've already visited and didn't find a solution on..\nEdit 1: Not sure if this is relevant, after installing fglrx and restarting, it seems my terminal view resolution has changed, now everything is now stretched horizontally (my monitor runs a 1920x1080 res natively). However, I still get the same message from fglrxinfo.\nEdit 2: I've just downloaded and installed KodiBuntu on the system listed above.. I need this same machine to double as a web development server, VirtualBox host, local cloud server, etc., which was why I went for Ubuntu Server initially.

Assuming you have that, if you're trying to run fglrxinfo over SSH or from a TTY it won't have a DISPLAY environment variable set so you'll need to specify it manually, like so:\nDISPLAY=:0 fglrxinfo\n\nAssuming the display is :0.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 14.04 Dual Boot on Dell XPS 15 9530 I'm trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 on my Dell XPS 15 9530, and I have a few questions.\nWhat I've done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deactivated acceleration in Intel Rapid Storage Technology\n\n*Disabled Intel Rapid Start Technology\n\n*Turned off Fast Start Up option in Windows Power Options\n\n\nI've followed this link for the installation, put Ubuntu 14.04 on a Live USB Stick, shrinked the Windows partition and tried to install it from there.\nMy problem is that to boot from the USB stick, I have to turn on the \"Load Legacy Option Rom\" in the UEFI, otherwise Windows doesn't show me the option to boot from it. (I use shift click on restart on my Windows 8.1, then choose the boot from device option).\nNow, I've read that enabling the Load Legacy Option Rom is not a very good way to do this, since, as far as I understand it, you then use 2 systems at the same time (i.e. Uefi for Windows, and the old Bios for Ubuntu and you need to switch back and forth between them).\nSo is there a way to boot from my USB stick while disabling the Load Legacy Option Rom?\nI've read here that you need to turn off Intel Smart Response and switch to AHCI. Is this safe? Because I get a warning that I'd have to re-install Windows if i'd do so.\nWhat I'd ultimately want to achieve is that at start up, I can choose what OS to boot with.\nHope someone can help\n\nA: You say:\n\nI have to turn on the \"Load Legacy Option Rom\" in the UEFI, otherwise Windows doesn't show me the option to boot from it.\n\nThe problem with this statement is that Windows doesn't show you boot options, except from its own boot manager, which must be configured much like you'd configure GRUB. The computer's firmware probably has its own boot manager, which should give you an option to boot to an external medium, but that has nothing to do with Windows. This may sound like I'm splitting hairs, but the point is that you need to know which boot manager (the firmware's or Windows') you're seeing so that you know how to configure it. In most cases it's better to use the firmware's boot manager, but how to access that boot manager varies from one machine to another. In most cases, you do so by hitting a function key, such as F8 or F11, although sometimes you'd use Esc or some other key. I don't know offhand what Dells most often use for this. Posting a digital photo of the boot manager menu might enable us to identify what you're seeing.\nMy first suspicion is that you're using the firmware's boot manager but that it's configured to not fully initialize the USB port, which of course will prevent it from showing you options on USB flash drives. I recommend you go through your firmware options and disable anything that refers to \"fast start\" or something similar, and to enable anything that refers to USB activation. (I realize you've already made a couple such changes, but it won't hurt to look again.) Note that there's no standardization of names or menus, so you'll just have to dig in and judge the names for yourself.\nAnother option would be to install my rEFInd boot manager in Windows. It might be able to find your missing USB boot options.\n", "Q: How do I run memtest86+?

Are there different methods for launching it whether Ubuntu is already installed?\n* (This is intended to be a canonical question easy for new users to follow.)\n\nA: memtest86+ comes default with Ubuntu and you can try it from live CD or from any installation of Ubuntu. Here are the steps:\n\n*\n\n*While booting press (better hold down) the Shift key to bring the grub menu that looks like the following image:\n\nAs you can see there are some options to choose from (this will vary from installation to insatllation), the one to look for is the third option in this screenshot i.e. Memory test (memtest86+), which will be there in the grub menu along with other options.\n\n\n*From the grub menu go to the appropriate option to select i.e. Memory test (memtest86+) and press Enter.\n\n\n\n*Now you will see a blue screen indicating that the memtest is running:\n\n\n\n*Now you can press c for more configuration options:\n\n\n\n*To exit from the memtest86+ session you can press Esc any time. There is no certain rule that how many passes you would run but the more the better.\nHere is an image (taken from here) showing that errors were encountered i.e. the test is failing in some memory locations (pointed out in the red portion) indicating the locations might have problems. If your memory does not have any problem then you won't get any red portion.\n\n\nA: To perform a memory test on Ubuntu Live CD and Installed system:\n\n*\n\n*Turn On or Restart the system.\n\n\n*Hold down Shift to bring up the GRUB menu.\n\n\n*Use the arrow keys to move to the entry labeled Ubuntu, memtest86+.\n\n\n*Press Enter. The test will run automatically, and continue until you end it by pressing the Escape key.\nAllow the test to run for at least one full pass.\n\nA: My Ubuntu 20.04 system with 128 GB RAM became very slow after I had to reload the OS.

Unsafe Swap Bug How do I Install lubuntu 14.04 with encrypted LVM?\nThe Desktop-Installer offers this option but it's bugged(Unsafe Swap) since 13.10.\nI tried with alternate CD but got an error on \"Select and install software\" and ended up with a system booting to a black screen with flashing cursor and after a little wait I got a busybox. It wouldn't even ask me for the password.\n\nA: I finally figured this out myself.\nThe easiest straighforward way is:\n1. Use the alternate CD (Its not offered for 14.04.2 at this time so use 14.04.1)\n2. Select \"Install\" (from the Unetbootin-menu - Important! - see details)\n3. If you're installing from an Image on USB-Pendrive: When you're asked to install grub to MBR select \"No\" and specify the correct target device.\nA little more Detail:\n1: The Bug in the Desktop-Installer still exists in  14.04.2 (I tried it). There is a workaround, described here. This should also lead to successfull install.\n2: I was Using Unetbootin to install the iso on my usb-pendrive.\nIt creates it's own bootmenu and offers the options \"Install\" \"Expert Install\" and \"Install Lubuntu\" among others.\n\"Install Lubuntu\" will fail at \"select and install software\" (this bug \nThere's another workaround that should lead to successfull install)\nSo better use \"Install\" (or \"Expert Install\"). That will lead to another bug if you use a usb-pendrive for installation but its easy to solve:\n3: (heres a bugreport ) Grub will be installed to the MBR of the usb-pendrive (you can  boot your PC with the usb-pendrive inserted)\nThe MBR-bug is easy to solve though by selecting \"No\" when you're asked if grub should be installed to MBR. This will not cancel the install of grub. You will be asked to specify the target device for grub-install.\nHoly Moly - May encryption be with you\nI also posted this in ubuntuforums\n", "Q: Can't access hdd Raspberry pi samba share I got a raspberry pi 2 and an old hdd, so i wanted to create a samba share for this old hdd.

Six hours in, and I have not yet succeeded. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. \nI am trying to install Ubuntu on a partition on my Lenovo Thinkpad, which is already running Windows 7 on a separate partition. I have a liveCD which I burnt using the ISO supplied from Ubuntu. Everything seems to start off smoothly, but about 20 minutes into the installation, I get the message: \n\nexecuting 'grub-install/dev/mmcblk0' failed. This is a fatal error. \n\nThe installer gives me no choice but to exit. \nI read that some people had luck changing some options in their BIOS, such as turning off quick boot. Unfortunately my BIOS doesn't give me any options like that. When I got to the boot section, it only offers that I change the priority order. \nI've read through many answers online, but they all seem to be for people trying to dual-boot off Windows 8, or for people trying to install Ubuntu fresh with no other OS. \nI've also tried using sudo grub-install from the Ubuntu Live Desktop, hoping to manually install grub, but I got this message: \n\nfailed to get canonical path of /cow.\n\nI tried using chroot: \nsudo mount /dev/sda /mnt\nsudo chroot /mnt\nsudo update-grub2\n\nBut I get the same message still. \nI also tried reading the dual-boot guide, as recommended in this answer:\n1st-time-install-of-ubuntu-as-dual-boot-on-my-win-7-notebook-now-grub-error\nHowever I did not read anything in that guide that helped me with this problem.\nI've heard that some folks had some luck formatting and re-creating the target partition so I am going to do that now, but only because I don't know what else to do. \nIs there a way to complete the installation without GRUB and then manually install it later?\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: I found the solution. \nWhen first installing Linux, I am asked where I want to install the BootLoader (on the partition screen), and the default selection is the live disk itself. I changed that to the drive (SDA), and that did the trick. Looks like it was trying to temporarily write files from the disk to the disk, instead of the hard drive. \nHope this is helpful to others. \n", "Q: Remove vim before installing vim-gnome?

It's only ~2MB either way, so it's up to you.\n\nA: You can have as many flavours of vim installed in you system like vim-basic(provided by default), vim-tiny, vim-gnome etc. \nYou can then choose which binary to use by giving preference of one over another using update-alternatives. update-alternatives decides which binary to execute depending on your preference when vim is used. \nBasically the vim binary (/usr/bin/vim) is a symbolic link to /etc/alternatives/vim, which in turn is a symbolic link to your preferred one (e.g. /usr/bin/vim.tiny or /usr/bin/vim.basic). You can read this to get more idea on this.\nSo you can install as many flavours of vim you want, you just need to choose the one you want to execute by using the preference.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 & AMD 14.6 Driver issue R7 260X Okay I have searched and for some reason I am just having problems installing the Beta driver 14.6 on Ubuntu 14.04.\nThis is my second installation today as I messed up my last one following other posts I found in the forums/search.\nI download the AMD driver and when I do everything to run it this pops up:\n\nPlease install the required pre-requisites for package generation\n  before proceeding with AMD Catalyst installation. Please check file\n  usr/share/ati/fglrx-install.log for more details.\n\nI tried doing the install anyhow but had no success. The default driver for 14.04 on my 260x is terrible with low FPS in games, around 5 FPS on low vs my Windows 7 running 60 (locked max at 60 fps).\nhttp://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/Latest-LINUX-Beta-Driver.aspx \nIs the link for the driver and requirements/needed packages. I tried installing the \"required\" packages and most of them came up as not found when doing the apt-get install command in the terminal.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. I have seen many tutorials for this but it is after they have the necessary things installed for the driver. I believe it is an issue with the required packages or something in the requirements to be honest. However, if people have installed these drivers on 14.04 then someone I would imagine has ran into this problem before.\n\nA: I have the same system and card. Until today I had the same problem. Go to System Settings > Software & Updates > Additional Drivers . Select AMD proprietary drivers with updates. As of today, it installs fglrx with OpenGL 4.4 and everything you could want. I've got (24x improvement) in FPS using this driver. \nI thought Additional Drivers only describes you what driver you are using. Not true, It does an automatic install of very recent proprietary driver.\n", "Q: Problem with referencing a drive with spaces in its label the problem...\nMy external HDD on a USB port is listed as device /dev/sdc with partition 1 of that drive /dev/sdc1 mounted on /media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive.\nThe problem is the spaces, I can't write anything to the drive, it results in an error.\nI need to be able to use cat or dd to pipe to zip (with preference) and store the compressed file on the /media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive.\nSuggestions on other methods of accessing the drive, I have tried changing the drive label but that results in a warning and it won't change.\n\nA: The correct, best solution would be changing the label of the disk. I too had problem with some disk and needed to do that in Windows (grrrr). \nTwo solutions: \n\n\n*\n\n*learn to quote the filenames correctly: \n ls \"/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/\"\n\n(notice the \") will work. See also http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-quoting or http://www.hypexr.org/bash_tutorial.php#spaces, and yes, spaces in file names are evil. \nSo for example to write to file in the disk you need to use \ndd if=something of=\"/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/file.out\" \n\nor whatever you are using. \n\n*create a symbolic link\n ln -s \"/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/\" /media/mark/mydisk\n\nand use now /media/mark/mydisk. It will work 99% of the cases... if you take care to not use it when the disk is not mounted. \nWhat does not work is trying to rename the mountpoint with mv: \n sudo mv \"/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/\" /media/mark/mydisk\n mv: cannot move ‘/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/’ to ‘/media/mark/mydisk’: Device or resource busy\n\nbecause a mount-point semantics are quite different from a plain directory. \n", "Q: \"group descriptors corrupted\" after resize of partition was interrupted. How to fix it in a short time I was running a resize of an ext4 partition, using gparted.\nAccidentally it was interrupted because the system restarted.\nSince that moment I cannot mount my partition anymore, dmesg|grep sda says group descriptors corrupted.\nI was trying to solve it with gparted, but it was taking quite a long time (more than 8 h).\nSo I killed e2fsck and gparted, to find another solution, did not find it.\nDo you have any suggestion to fix the partition possibly in a short time?\n\nA: Never ever stop a resize or an e2fsck!\nIf your files are not all lost by now, let the e2fsck finish!\nSorry to be the harbinger of bad news...  :-(\n", "Q: will Ubuntu touch support Virtualbox? Will it be possible to install Virtualbox on a future tablet with Ubuntu Touch, so that some needed Windows programs could be run?\n\nA: Run the command\negrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo\n\nfrom an open terminal to see if this is possible.\n0 means no and 1+ means yes\nYou may still be able to run a virtual machine if the answer is no but it will run really slow.\nsee here for more info\n\nIf you want to run windows programs on ubuntu, just install wine and you won't need virtualization.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nRight click on the exe file and choose to run with wine.\n\nA: The answer can only be it depends on the tablet hardware. If the tablet is x86 based then yes, you will be able to use wine or VirtualBox. If it is arm-based then the most likely answer is no.\nYou should be able to run a x86 emulator in arm, but it'll be too slow to run windows programs, and you'll be able to run some arm Windows apps through wine but this is not probably what you are looking for.\n\nA: To answer the \"does (the usual ARM) Ubuntu Touch device support running typical x86/64bit Windows applications through Wine\"? \nThe short answer is: no. Wine is not about emulating CPU architecture, but about translating Windows system/library calls into Linux system/library calls. But instead you will be able to run natively ARM Windows applications\nIf the application is old enough and 32bit, you can run it on DOSBox (DOSBox supports Windows 95, but you need to install it yourself).

I use Thermald and tlp for managing battery life (they are great!). However, sometimes I don't care about noise and power consumption, and want the CPU to run at full 3.5GHz. For some reason, this seems impossible to achieve. The fan never runs full speed, and the processor is always throttled down. When I use cpufreq-info I never see more than 2.8GHz (so turbo boost does not work), and the frequency drops down to 800Mhz when the fan starts getting \"loud\". This is with intel p-state and performance governor. Powersafe governor is even \"worse\", but that's good as it increases battery life.\nAny ideas how to enable \"full power\"?\nThank you!\n\nA: Yes, all you have to do is:\nfirst, set tlp \"governer\" to performance for both ac and batt in your /etc/default/tlp file and while you are there, go ahead and enable turbo boost as well\nthen, edit /etc/default/grub and insert \nintel_pstate=disable\n\nafter\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\n\nlike this example\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"intel_pstate=disable quiet splash\"\n\nexecute this command to apply the change to grub\nsudo update-grub\n\nthen, install indicator-cpufreq\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nreboot for your changes to take effect.\nAfter you reboot, you will see an icon on your unity panel, click on this icon and you can set the cpu to performance (full), ondemand (only when needed), powersave, or conservative.  \n\nDisabling pstate may not be necessary, you can try it on and off to see if there is a difference. Make sure to update grub after making that change.\nAlso, indicator-cpufreq will not allow changes with pstate on (only with pstate disabled), you will still have to do that manually.\nFinally, you can get better numbers from i7z:\nsudo apt-get install i7z\n\nand then, run\nsudo i7z\n\n\nInstall lm-sensors and run sensors detect:\nsudo apt-get install lm-sensors\n\nsudo sensors-detect\n\nFollow the prompts and select yes to everything.\n\nfinally, these links may help:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/09/adobe-flash-player-hardware.html\nNot only does this allow hardware acceleration for flash but installs VDPAU and i965\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2014/01/enable-hardware-acceleration-in-chrome.html\nand these more recent benchmarks show a slight advantage from disabling pstate and using performance\nhttp://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=intel_5960x_pstate&num=2\n\nA: I managed to figure this out. As usually, Sony decided to do things their way and so this is specific to Vaio laptops only.\nTo set full performance, you need to type in terminal:\necho performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop/thermal_control\n\nThis sets your laptop to performance mode, and no throttling happens.\n", "Q: Accessing tty1 through 6 takes unreasonably long When I try to switch from the X session (tty7), it takes very long.

My problem is that I am not the administrator neither routers and can not redirect port 22.  I Googled a bit and I understood that it could set a VPN between the two PCs but I have no idea if this is feasible, or how to do it \n\nA: Without access to the routers or changing the router it is going to be virtually impossible. Your router has a firewall. A firewall is a wall blocking ALL data. Rules are added to allow certain data. A port is a specif door in the wall, and a \"port forward\" is a door to a specific PC. \nWithout a port going to the target box there is NO way to send data to it (unless it requests the data first). So you cannot initiate a connection the PC. This applies to VPN, SSH, web or anything else. \nedit:\nPC1 -> Router1 -> Internet <- router 2 <- PC2  correct?\nYou should be able to use a service like splashtop or logmein. These have 3rd party servers that are involved in your connection. That is VERY different in terms of security from SSH, but if you don't care about a 3rd party such a thing should work. \n", "Q: Which Ubuntu distribution should I install on my PC I am new to Ubuntu, but I want to try some flavor of it.

If less than 2GB of ram, you are probably better off with version i386 instead.\nAs far as flavors go, the installation media will allow you to \"try ubuntu without installing\" and all you have to do is choose this option before you start.

I clean and update like crazy, and I brought that habit to my new Linux machine as I want things to stay good.  So, every morning I run six update commands: dist-upgrade, upgrade, update, autoremove, autoclean, & check, and then I run them all again (because I've noticed things are sometimes different the second time around).  I have aliased these so I only type one letter (u) and my password, and those six commands run, twice.  Also, once a week I use bleach bit in both regular and super user modes, and I haven't checked all those boxes, just what I think are the safe ones.  I have been doing this for a while now and everything has been good.  I have even run these commands since I lost my GUI and I get no error messages.  Everything seems to be well.\nI have only downloaded a small number of things not from the software center: Google Earth, Google Chrome, and a couple of other small things that I forget what they are but those were quite a while ago and have given me no problems that I can detect.\nI work hard to keep this box in a good clean condition.\nSo, this last Saturday morning (February 28) I fire my baby up and I got no GUI.  What?  The rest of the machine works.  I'm writing this in one of those other shells (CTRL ALT F1).\nI have looked over a number of the other questions found by searching for \"Lost GUI Ubuntu 14.04\" and they all seem to be for other circumstances, speciality cases, unless of course I missed something.  In my case, I had it fresh from the factory, all has worked well for well over six months and then, all of a sudden, poof!  It's gone!\nSo, I don't know what to think really.  I don't think any of my hardware died.  I wouldn't think any of those updating commands or bleach bit would have done anything bad.\n\nA: So I got a hold of the manufacturer of my machine, System76, and they figured it out for me.  Turned out it was a bad .config file in my home directory.  So we renamed the .config directory .config.bak.\nReboot the machine and I'm good.  I had to rework some of my configurations for the launch bar and such, but I got my system back and in my own account.\nAll is well.  Thanks System 76!\n", "Q: how can I tell - using terminal - how often the package manager checks for updates?

There is no Legacy option in bios and the only thing I can boot from the USB is a Gparted disk utilizing Grub/EFI loader in which I can partition the drive. But nothing else will boot from USB including Boot Repair, ReFINd, multiple Linux Live CDs, or Super Grub disks. Ubuntu installation disks won't show up, there is no boot loader on the hard drive and I don't know how to get anything installed. It seems to be a UEFI motherboard PC without a bios boot option. All the articles I am coming across deal with dual boots on EFI, or Windows 8 machines. Mine was a Windows 8 preinstalled machine that no longer has Windows on it. Any guidance on installing a boot loader and Ubuntu would be much appreciated.  \n\nA: There is much variation in hardware, but I was able to boot to an Ubuntu 14.04 live USB in UEFI / Secure Boot mode by doing the following:\n1) Download the Ubuntu distro you want. It must be the 64 bit version.\n2) Install the distro to USB stick using PendriveLinux.com's Universal USB Installer.\n3) Power off the PC, insert the USB stick, and power on.\n4) Hold down the appropriate key to enter the BIOS.\n5) Change the boot order so that the USB stick is first\nNote, unlike regular BIOSes I am used to, you have to do this step EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO BOOT OFF USB.  The boot order changes are not persistent!  In fact, my UEFI BIOS does not even offer me this choice unless a UEFI bootable USB stick is currently inserted  Until I figured this out, I was in the same situation as you, I could not get it to boot off USB at all.\n6) Exit the BIOS \"saving\" your changes and allow the boot to complete.\n\nA: I ended up solving this issue. I found out that even though the netbook was a newer model it was actually 32 bit. Therefore none of the 64 bit disk images would boot because they only contained 64 bit EFI drivers. I ended up... \n\n\n*\n\n*Downloading a 32 bit version of Linux Mint (which didn't have EFI support).\n\n*I took the EFI folder from Gparted boot disk (which also had 32 bit EFI drivers) and copied it to the Linux Mint USB.

Is there a way to modify the mount options for an encrypted home partition on Ubuntu, specifically to remove the nosuid option?\nRelatedly, is removing nosuid likely to cause any difficulties mounting the encrypted home?\n\nAdding more details because the original question was ambiguous.\nI'm trying to build a project that requires it not be on a drive mounted with the nosuid mount option. Recently, after the update to Trusty, it started complaining about nosuid.\nI checked fstab, but didn't see the option in use:\n$ cat /etc/fstab\n\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n...\nUUID=<snip> /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n...\n\nSo I checked /proc/mounts, and it looks like my home folder is a VFS mount used by eCryptFS because my home is encrypted:\n$ cat /proc/mounts\n\n...\n/home/cdot/.Private /home/cdot ecryptfs rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,ecryptfs_fnek_sig=<snip>,ecryptfs_sig=<snip>,ecryptfs_cipher=aes,ecryptfs_key_bytes=16,ecryptfs_unlink_sigs 0 0 gvfsd-fuse /run/user/1001/gvfs fuse.gvfsd-fuse rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=1001,group_id=1001 0 0\n...\n\nBut so far I can't find where the mount options eCryptFS is using were set, or how to change them. So that brings me back to the original questions: Where can I set this, and (bonus) is the nosuid option just precautionary or will removing it break eCryptFS?\nThanks in advance for any details.\n\nA: I ran in to this problem building LinuxCNC to run on Ubuntu 18.04; the LinuxCNC code uses setuid root binaries to talk to the PREEMPT RT kernel extensions and specifically disallows execution as root. I built the code in my ecryptfs home directory and the LinuxCNC code did not have a useful error message but I eventually tracked it down to the 'nosuid' mount option ecryptfs adds.\nMy (temporary) workaround is to perform a run-time modification of the mount. This will not persist across reboots but has allowed me to test the application and it may be useful to others.\nsudo mount -i -o remount,suid $HOME\n\nOther than the security implications I do not expect the operation of the ecryptfs filesystem will be impacted.\n\nA: You can modify the mount point in /etc/fstab. Ensure that whichever mount point you choose exists and has appropriate permissions. \n", "Q: how to configure USB mounted WiFi WLAN Adapter I have a WiFi USB adapter/router .

I see partial answer in one posting, but my question was not entirely answered. When a scan is done on the windows partition, does it also scan the Ubuntu 12.04 partition?\n\nA: Windows can't access files on an ext4 partition which Ubuntu uses by default unless you install third party software on Windows to access files on ext4 partitions. For more information see How to read ext4 partitions on Windows? and Does an ext4 writer for Windows exist?.  Even if you took the trouble to install third party software to read/write ext4 in Windows, I still don't know if Comodo \"likes\" ext4. Comodo for Linux can read/write ext4, but I don't know if this functionality extends to Comodo for Windows, which is where you need Comodo the most. Google was not my friend this time when I tried to find out. \nAnother way to do it is to install ClamTK antivirus in Ubuntu from the Ubuntu Software Center. ClamTK can also scan files in Ubuntu for Windows malware. I am going to recommend doing it this way, because XP is unstable enough now that support for Windows XP has ended without complicating your XP system any further. If it works, don't fix it.\n\nA: I have clamTK installed on my Ubuntu machine, but I have windows 7 on another machine which I check with Windows defender.\nHowever, another solution I use on both machines is to download the free Avira rescue system from\nhttp://www.avira.com/en/download/product/avira-rescue-system\nAlthough it is advertised as a scan and repair solution, it can also be used to regularly scan your system for threats and viruses. The rescue system comes as an iso image so you need to create a bootable CD from the image.\nWhen used with Ubuntu or windows machine it first loads Linux then gives you an options menu.\nDuring the boot process you are prompted for an internet connection and (if you give it access) automatically downloads the latest virus / malware definitions before it scans/repairs.\nIt seems to do a thorough job and since I started using it I have had no virus/malware problems at all on either machine. It also provides a useful registry editor.\nHowever, I have not tried it with a dual boot Ubuntu/Windows machine but I don't see any reason why it should not work.

They are in the process of releasing a version for the new XPS 9343. In his post, Barton George says there are currently issues.\n\n*Once they complete these fixes, they will be sent upstream, and will land in future Linux kernels and versions. I have a 9333 and it works very well out of the box with any Linux distro that came out after Dell had pushed updates for the hardware.\n\n*Brand new laptops almost always have trouble with Linux. Windows drivers are all built and tested before the product is released. Linux drivers are built after, and take a while to make it to the mainline.\n\n*The flip side is that Intel's Ultrabook initiative has helped Linux compatibility greatly. Pretty much any mid-to-high end laptop you buy right now is a certified 'Ultrabook' and has the same chipset and graphics as the others of that generation. Things like wireless, camera, ACPI aren't the same between machines, but they typically come from a fairly small pool which tends to get support soon.\n\n*Try newer distros. Either a beta of Ubuntu 15.04 or Arch linux (among others) will have a newer kernel and more updated support for things in the Broadwell chipset.\n\n\nNow... more to the point of your currently posted question. I haven't picked up a daisy chaining monitor or a MST hub to test out display port daisy chaining, and it seems like not many people care (many laptops have both HDMI and DP these days, the lack of dual output on the XPS 13 was almost a dealbreaker for me).

Using image (shotwell photo) viewer I can rotate them individually by clicking the rotate button but that's too tedious. \nI looked at man shotwell and shotwell --help-all but there's nothing that explains how to invoke the rotate command from the command line. \nIs there any way I can invoke the rotate command of shotwell (or any other viewer) from the terminal? Or any other methods to rotate images are welcome too.\n\nA: If you're looking for a pure bash implementation, ImageMagick's convert command is what you're looking for:\nfor szFile in /path/*.png\ndo \n    convert \"$szFile\" -rotate 90 /tmp/\"$(basename \"$szFile\")\" ; \ndone\n\nAbove will leave existing files intact and copy the newly rotated ones to /tmp so you can move or copy them somewhere else or even replace the existing ones after the conversion and after verification.\n(and it'll work on all recent releases of Ubuntu as it's standard software)\n\nA: Here's how I do it:\n\n*\n\n*Install gThumb\n sudo apt-get install gthumb\n\n\n\n*Open up nautilus and go to your images directory. Right click on one and choose Open with -> gthumb.\n\n\n*Under the view menu choose Browser or press the Esc key. This will open the directory browser showing all your images.\n\n\n\n*Press Ctrl and select the images you want to rotate or select all of them via Ctrl + A.\n\n\n*On the toolbar, select Tools and then Rotate Right or Rotate Left depending on your preference.\n\n\nA: for file in *.JPG; do convert $file -rotate 90 rotated-$file; done\n\nThis will copy-rotate-and-rename your files.\nIf you want to leave the original files untouched just yet, this method may work well for you...\n Note that this is case-sensitive: if your files are named *.jpg replace with lower-case (or *.png ...) accordingly. \n\nA: If you want to overwrite in-place, mogrify from the ImageMagick suite seems to be the easiest way to achieve this:\n# counterclockwise:\nmogrify -rotate -90 *.jpg\n\n# clockwise:\nmogrify -rotate 90 *.jpg\n\nCAVEAT: This isn't a lossless rotation method for JPEG files, https://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?t=5899.\njpegtran achieves this (untested):\n# counterclockwise\nls *.jpg | xargs -n 1 jpegtran -perfect -rotate 270\n\n# clockwise\nls *.jpg | xargs -n 1 jpegtran -perfect -rotate 90\n\n\nA: As krlmlr notes in their answer, jpegtran (installed on Ubuntu with sudo apt install libjpeg-turbo-progs) is available for lossless rotation, but because it outputs to standard output, the command to use it would be something like this:\n$ for img in *.jpg; do jpegtran -rotate 90 -copy all $img > rotated-${img}; done\n\nThis command will take each file in the current directory, and produce a rotated version (90° clockwise) copy of each file with the new name rotated-image-name.jpg. The switch -copy all is to copy all metadata to the new file.\nFor more information see man jpegtran.\nAn additional piece of information given that the original question referenced Shotwell: according to Shotwell's documentation, Shotwell's rotations and other edits will not actually edit the files on disk:\n\nShotwell is a non-destructive photo editor. It does not modify your original photographs. That is to say, if you crop a photo or adjust its colors, the photo file on disc remains untouched. Shotwell stores your edits in a database and applies them on the fly as necessary. This means you can undo any alterations you make to a photograph.\n\n\nA: A nice solution is to make a set of backups (e.g. prefixed backup-), rotate the original files producing a set of new files (prefixed e.g. rotated-), giving you a set of\n\n\n*\n\n*img-1.png\n\n*backup-img-1.png\n\n*rotated-img-1.png\n\n*img-2.png\n\n*...and so on\nThe mv/cp tools [bash globbing] can only add prefixes, it's messy to take them away (it'd use parameter expansion, ewww...)\nThe rename tool allows you to use s/before/after/ substitution syntax (from the sed tool) to swap that safeguard prefix and overwrite the original files, so your overall process for a given set of pictures img-{1..n}.png would be:\nfor imgf in img-*.png; do mv \"$imgf\" \"backup-$imgf\"; done\nfor imgf in backup-img-*.png; do convert \"$imgf\" -rotate 90 \"rotated-$imgf\"; done\n\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*you could use cp rather than mv, but then there's 2 copies of the original lying around (downside is you get concatenation of prefixes, \"rotated-backup-...\")\n\n*rotation is clockwise (-rotate 270 gets you 90° anti-clockwise)\n\n*to track progress, add echo \"Rotating ${imgf#backup-} ... \"; after convert calls (before done)\n\n*for a more compact form (e.g. a set of numbered files), use some parameter expansion like echo \"$(echo ${imgf#backup-img-} | cut -d\\. -f 1)...\"; instead  \n( You can't remove prefix and suffix in the same bash param expansion hence use cut )\nThen after verification you've not messed up, delete the pictures by moving them back to the original\nrename 's/^rotated-//;' rotated-*\nrm backup-img-*\n\n\nA: You can copy/paste this code, and save it as rotate.sh\n#!/bin/bash -e\n\nCUR_DIR=$(pwd)\ncd $1\nfor file in *.jpg\ndo\n    convert $file -rotate 90 $file\ndone\ncd $CUR_DIR\n\nAfter saving this file, run it from terminal using ./rotate.sh folder_containing_images. \n\nA: How about exiftran - transform digital camera jpeg images\nI know it's a bit limiting (jpeg) but it has automatic (using exif orientation tag).\nfor photo in *.jpg\n  do exiftrans -ia $photo\ndone\n\nAbout Exiftran,  it is  a command line utility to transform digital camera jpeg images. It can do lossless rotations like jpegtran(1), but unlike jpegtran(1) it cares about the EXIF data: It can rotate images automatically by checking the exif orientation tag; it updates the exif informations if needed (image dimension, orientation); it also rotates the exif thumbnail. It can process multiple images at once\n\nA: If you have ffmpeg and if your images are numbered consecutively starting from zero with 6 digits, you can rotate them with\nffmpeg -pattern_type glob -i '*.jpg' -start_number 0 -vf \"transpose=1\" -qscale:v 5 %06d.jpg \n\nThe digit after qscale:v controls output quality, lower is better.\n", "Q: How do I install NVIDIA drivers in Ubuntu GNOME 14.10? I have just built my first custom PC with a GeForce GTX 750 Ti Graphics card. I've installed Ubuntu GNOME 14.10 and get a set resolution of 800x600 stretched across a 1080p screen. I've downloaded the official NVIDIA drivers.\nWhen I run the file, it says it must be run without Xorg running. I've have tried pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 to enter a command line system but instead of displaying a command line login, the screen goes completely blank. I cannot see what I am doing since there is no screen output whatsoever.\n\nA: There are a couple of ways.  I realize you've already download proprietary drivers.  However, there is a chance you might be able to download support drivers that are already tested and by the community.\nYou might first try running Additional Drivers (System Settings -> Software Updates -> Additional Drivers).\nYou'll most likely conveniently find a number of drivers, one of which might resolve your 800X600 stretched issue.\nTo run the downloaded driver install, you can stop X11 on ubuntu by hitting CTRLALTF1 then login and run:\n$ sudo service lightdm stop\n\nor\n$ sudo stop lightdm\n\nThen proceed to run your downloaded install program.\n", "Q: Any c functions to simulate double click on file?

Programming languages in general?\n\n\nIn short, I would like to know as an ubuntu user, what are the major limitations of the phone operating system.\n\nA: This is what told to be the fact:\nUbuntu Touch (Ubuntu Phone) uses the Qt 5-based touch user interface and various software frameworks originally developed for Maemo and MeeGo such as oFono as telephony stack, accounts-sso for single sign-on, and Maliit for input. Utilizing libhybris the system can often be used with Linux kernels used in Android, which makes it easily ported to most recent Android smartphones.\nUbuntu Phone OS utilizes the same core technologies as the Ubuntu Desktop, so applications designed for the latter platform run on the former and vice versa. Additionally, Ubuntu Desktop components come with the Ubuntu Touch system; allowing Ubuntu Touch devices to provide a full desktop experience when connected to an external monitor. Ubuntu Touch devices can be equipped with a full Ubuntu session and may change into a full desktop operating system when plugged into a docking station. If plugged the device can use all the features of Ubuntu and user can perform office work or even play ARM-ready games on such device.\n", "Q: I was snooping around my computer, and found this.

Do take notice of the \"NONE\" in the filesystem column. This indicates a partition that is not physical but stored in memory. See also: what does device node 'none' means in file system?\n\nA: /dev/sda4 is mounted at the root of the filesystem, which is what / represents.\nIt's sort of like the root of the Ubuntu filesystem tree, everything else comes under root, unless you specifically mount parts of your system on other partitions.\nWhen you type a file path, that first / represents root.\n", "Q: Can't connect to a server via SSH (with my PC only) For some days I'm experiencing issues with SSH on my machine (I guess after having installed some software that I don't remember).\nIt's very problematic as I use Git to work on some code projects with other people, pushing my work on a repository via SSH.\nI'm 100 % sure the problem is coming from my computer (Linux Mint 16 cinnamon), because:\nFrom the same Internet connection (same router, same IP), I can connect without any problem to the same server with another computer.

This way detection should work, otherwise GRUB isn't able to detect and chainload the Windows UEFI bootloader.\nUEFI and MBR-booting are different, incompatible architectures.\nTo solve your problem, you could install the UEFI version of GRUB in your current installation, which would replace GRUB-MBR, but you would also need to make some configuration changes, therefore it's better to install Ubuntu in UEFI mode anew.\nAlso I don't know of any 32-Bit Windows 8 OEM installations.

Since kernel version 2.1.21 the types ext and xiafs do\n  not exist anymore. Earlier, usbfs was known as usbdevfs. Note, the\n  real list of all supported filesystems depends on your kernel.Mount Man Page\n\n", "Q: How can display a message on terminal when open it how can i display a message when open terminal.\ni want to display a Specified text right after open terminal any time.\nhence before do anything,i want that text will shown.\ni want to understand what file or files should change...\nthank you\n\nA: You can add it to your ~/.bashrc.

I want to split the SSD and install Windows/Ubuntu. The 500GB HDD is shared storage (NTFS).\nI want my Dropbox Folder and other Data Stuff to be shared on the HDD. I found an article that claims that the Dropbox thing works.\nShare Your Dropbox folder Between Windows and Linux Using a Data Partition\nMy question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you have long-term experience with such a dual-boot setup and can recommend it?\n\n*This setup will be my daily driver so it should be reliable. I had some bad experience with dual-boot so I wanted some confirmation that it will work reliable.\n\n*Minor side question: I found threads that recommend putting the home folder on the shared drive. Are there any long term experiences with that?\n\n\nEdit:\nWith long-term I mean at least 1-2 years and not just 2 weeks.\nWith reliable I mean that I don't want to fix some Grub stuff every 3 months. I want it to work after setting things up.\n\nA: \nDo you have long-term experience with such a dual-boot setup and can recommend it?\n\nYes and yes. I started using Dropbox just after it started and have been using the same disk space for Windows and Ubuntu.\n\nThis setup will be my daily driver so it should be reliable. I had some bad experience with dual-boot so I wanted some confirmation that it will work reliable.\n\nIt is reliable. Biggest problem with dual boot related problems tends to be the user. I have yet to face any problems with my dual boot. I started with Ubuntu 12.04LTS + Windows 7 and am now on Ubuntu 15.04 + the same Windows 7 where every 6 months my Ubuntu system is formatted and re-installed. \n\nMinor side question: I found threads that recommend putting the home folder on the shared drive. Are there any long term experiences with that?\n\nI would vote against that. I would keep /home/$USER/ on the same partition as / (there is no need for an /home/ partition anymore). But symlink the directories to the shared directory. \n\nMy current setup: 120GB SSD, 1Tb HDD. SSD is split in Windows base (or C:) and / and the HDD holds all the data for both systems where 200Gb is NTFS and the rest ext4. I hardly use Windows 7 (mostly to program my remote :X )\n", "Q: Why does my firewall reset upon reboot?

Why does | zip keep telling me it has nothing to do when used with cat but no error or warning with dd\n\nA: If the disk is almost full, there is no sense in compressing the image; it will take ages with no practical effect. And restoring will be much slower too. \ndd copies physical, byte-by-byte partitions or disks. It works by reading N bytes from the input and writing them to the output, and then repeating. N is by default 512 bytes.\nTo copy a disk/partition physically, use \ndd bs=10M if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/dest/image.img \n\nthis will read blocks of 10Mbytes at a time. If you have plenty of RAM you can up that number too. The size of the file will be exactly the same as the size of the disk/partition used (but it can occupy less disk sometime --- dd can create sparse files). \nYou can check the progress in another terminal with \nls -lh /path/to/dest/image.img \n\nwhich will give you the size of the image file (more or less --- it will be in chunks, really). \nTriple check (with mount) that no partition of the disk to copy is mounted or used anywhere, or the created image will be invalid (and worst things can happen, too). Be careful about swap areas, too.   \nYou can mount the image to check if it's ok with a loopback filesystem and a bit of tricks.\nAnyway, there are also tools that helps the tasks: How to make a disk image and restore from it later?\nIf your system is not recent (the system from where you are booting, I mean), be warned of this bug --- fixed from 14.04 onward, but still there for older kernels. \n\nA: Compressing a whole drive's or a partition's image using Gzip may lead to a tremendous reduction in file size but only in case there were no unused data remnants stored and unused space is uniformly filled e.g. by Zeros.\nThis may be the case for a very new hardly used drive, or for a drive where we had manually filled unused space with Zeros (e.g. using the utility zerofree ).\n\n\n*\n\n*This is however not the case for an old used drive where data remnants will be randomly dispersed all over the drive, for a drive where a secure wipe had filled unused space with random numbers, or after a wholde disk encryption. In these cases Gzip will not be able to compress so much or not at all (random numbers can't be compressed).\n\n*It also is not the case for a SSD used in write mode for some time because on each write all memory blocks will be evenly distributed all over the drive by the drive's firmware to avoid wear leveling. Then any compression of an image will also compress those data remnants which will be more and more random over time.\nSo, in your case a 3.9 GiB compressed image of a 50 GiB SSD may be possible for a rather new, hardly used drive or a drive mainly used for reading but not for writing much onto it. But then it is a sensible value.\nTo find out for sure we'd need to decompress the image to compare it's content with the source.\n", "Q: Is there any official ports of Ubuntu touch for nexus 6 Is there any official ports of Ubuntu touch for nexus 6?\nI searched the whole internet and not seems to find anything juicy.\nI remember it used to support in my old galaxy nexus and nexus 7.\n\nA: No. The Nexus 6 is not officially supported.

Unless they are the same name you need to have user@remote\n\nA: @Shutupsqaure answer is correct; but if you want to maintain different usernames on the remote computer, you can just edit/create a $HOME/.ssh/config file and put in it: \nHost nickname\n    HostName hadoopslave \n    User hadoop1\n\n(edit for your situation, clearly). \nNow ssh nickname is the same as ssh hadoop1@hadoopslave. \n$HOME/.ssh must be mode 0700 --- it must be in the home directory of the user that issues the ssh command. No need at all to restart the service (do not confuse the ssh client and the server!)\nAnother very useful keyword is IdentityFile --- but you can put more or less every possible ssh option in that file; you can see the details in man ssh. \n", "Q: Huawei USB modem not listed on connections menu after config with network manager I can configure my USB 3G modem.

So what can I do to make the modem show up on the connections screen? Sometimes it works, other times it is not listed and I cannot connect.

There is a lot of questions about creation of windows 8 usb stick in linux environment. And a lot of answers pointing to Winusb(saucy) as an app that can do it. I installed it too, using this method:\n\n\n*\n\n*downloading 64bit\nwget https://launchpad.net/~colingille/+archive/freshlight/+files/winusb_1.0.11+saucy1_amd64.deb\n\n\n*Install Winusb\nsudo dpkg -i winusb_1.0.11+saucy1*\n\n\n*Fix dependencies errors\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nI check my iso file md5 and sha1 hashes and they are Ok. Then I start Winusb and create bootable usb from iso file. After it finished working iso file hashes are not the same any more. The size of the iso file is the same.\nSo my question is is it some harmfull virus-like behavior, or is it some bug or is it normal at all? Does anyone experience such problem with winusb or is it my system? How can I\nfind what changes?\nI took new iso an restored old one - to compare. Used diff -r -q [iso1] [iso2] command - result was - files differ.\nI extracted them into the different folders to find exactly where they differ and used \"diff -r -q [dir1] [dir2]\" command - result was empty. Like if they where identical.\nSo again: Is it ok that iso-file hashes are changing? And how can I find what data in iso is changing?\n\nA: It's normal. Winusb adds some data to iso before writing it to USB .\nDon't worry. You should be able to install windows from USB device written by winusb. \n", "Q: Is there a place to check for security of repositories? I wanted to add some themes from sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes. How do I ensure these are safe repos? They are listed in many blogs and answers, however is there an official place I could check for the risk of malware? \nI actually added them and then removed them using \nsudo apt-get clean \nsudo apt-get remove\n\nAm I safe after that usually? I also scanned my system using clamav and its fine. Perhaps I need to see the files that might have gotten installed to make sure there are no harmful scripts or binaries. \nDo I need to re-install system to make sure I don't risk security issues with my data?\n\nA: The only way to ensure that a PPA is \"safe\": Download the source packages published in that repository and check the source code contained in these source packages. Also, before installing updates on your machine, you would have to re-check the PPA to see if a new source package has been uploaded and audit that new source code.\nObviously, most users are unable to do that because they lack the skills required for a security audit. And it would be very time-consuming.\nIf you installed at least one package from that PPA (either through apt-get install, or apt-get upgrade), it is theoretically possible that your system is now infected, even after you apt-get removed that package. Packages are installed using root (administrator) privileges, so they can harm your system in any conceivable way. Usually, the packages are not harmful though. As far as I know, nobody attempted to infect Ubuntu systems through PPAs yet.\nAfter doing add-apt-repository, you should remove the PPA if you no longer want it. If it contains malicious packages, this is however not a safe way to revert to a clean state.\nHow can PPAs be removed?\nIf we assume that there was a malicious package installed on your system, the only way to be sure to get rid of an infection is to re-install the system completely, or revert to an older backup of your system.\n\nA: It is recommend that one uses only official repositories of canonical and Ubuntu but still to enhance features of Ubuntu sometimes unofficial repos are required. \nppa from noobslab are safe although no one can ensure it but people have been using them from many years and I didn't saw any person complaining about infection from unofficial ppa .\nAnyway if you want to use only official ppa, there is no option then a fresh install. \n", "Q: How can I fix E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)?

In all the articles and reviews about Ubuntu Phone, I have been missing one crucial information: What protocols are supported to synchronise your contacts and calendars with your device? CalDav/GroupDav? ActiveSync? Gmail?\n\nA: It is possible to sync your Official Aquaris Ubuntu Edition with e.g. Owncloud using CardDAV. This is what I did (see wiki.ubuntuusers.de for source):\n\n\n*\n\n*First I added the certificate of my site to the folder /usr/share/ca-certificates and updates the ca-cert database, since it is self-signed:\nsudo mount /dev/loop0 / -o remount,rw\nsudo cp /home/phablet/Downloads/server.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates\n\nAdd a star to the new certificate while running the configuration\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates\n\n\n*Add the syncevolution configuration:\nsyncevolution --keyring=no --configure --template webdav username=<USERNAME> password=<PASSWORD> syncurl=\"in-its.de/owncloud\" target-config@owncloud\nsyncevolution --configure --template SyncEvolution_Client sync=none syncURL=local://@owncloud username= password= peerIsClient=1 owncloud\nsyncevolution --configure database=https://<SERVER>/owncloud/remote.php/carddav/addressbooks/<USERNAME>/contacts backend=carddav target-config@owncloud contacts\nsyncevolution --configure sync=two-way backend=contacts database=\"Persönlich\" owncloud contacts\n\n\n*Run sync:\nsyncevolution --sync slow owncloud contacts\n\nThat made all my Owncloud contacts available on my Ubuntu Phone.\nAnd CalDAV works similar:\nsyncevolution --configure database=https://<SERVER>/owncloud/remote.php/caldav/calendars/<USERNAME>/personal backend=caldav target-config@owncloud calendar\nsyncevolution --configure sync=two-way backend=events database=\"Persönlich\" owncloud calendar\n\nAnd then sync it:\nsyncevolution --sync slow owncloud calendar\n\nSo CalDAV and CardDAV are working!\n\nA: I finally managed to connect to my phone by updating the repositories with\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:phablet-team/tools && sudo apt-get update\n\nBut no after setting everything up I get an error when running the sync\n[ERROR @baikal] transport problem: PROPFIND: Neon error code 1, no HTTP status: Server certificate verification failed: certificate issued for a different hostname, issuer is not trusted\n\nSo I guess I need some kind of certificate for my baikal server.

GParted isn't on a live CD, it's on my virtual machine.\nI also have 11.53 GB of unallocated space that I would want to put into this partition. However, I'm running my Ubuntu system on VirtualBox and I don't have a live CD of the operating system because I downloaded the ISO from Ubuntu's website, so how am I supposed to expand my partition's size in that case without losing all of my data? \nI looked at similar postings but I'm new to partitioning and I don't want to ruin my virtual machine so any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Just as in a bare metal system we can also boot our virtual machine from a live CD .iso we had mounted as a CD-ROM to our virtual machine.\nMake sure you leave the hard disk boot order allowing to boot from CD-ROM first.\nAfter that we will boot this machine from a live session where we can access the still attached virtual drive from GParted.\nConsider taking a snapshot or export your VM before you change partitions.\nAlso see: How do I increase the hard disk size of the virtual machine??\nIn case we do not need to increase the partition size of the exisiting partition but only need more space, e.g. for HOME, we can also partition the still unallocated space of our resized hard drive. This new partition can then be used for additional space in the VM.\n", "Q: Why is there an \"update-grub\" and a \"update-grub2\" command? I updated my linux machine (dist-upgrade) and the linux-headers were updated. Suddenly the Windows option in GRUB was gone (booting parallel).\nThis was solved by issuing \"update-grub\" everything works fine now.\nQuestion: I have the command update-grub and update-grub2. Whats the difference? If Grub2 is installed, why is there an update-grub command which I presume is grub 1?\n\nA: Many years ago, GRUB1 was still a thing. When GRUB2 came along, it needed various commands but because GRUB1 was still the main system in use, there needed to be a way to differentiate the utilities, meaning a load of ...2-style commands were created.\nAfter the transition, people were still using both commands (for the same jobs), therefore to stop people's scripts breaking, they were just linked together. You can see that:\n$ file $(which update-grub{,2})\n/usr/sbin/update-grub:  POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable\n/usr/sbin/update-grub2: symbolic link to `update-grub'\n\nNote that symlinking commands together doesn't always mean something does the same thing (an application can read what command was run) but if you look at the source of update-grub, you can see this isn't the case here. They do exactly the same thing.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Nvidia driver fail i have bought a new Dell inspiron 15 - 3542 that has Nvidia (GM108M [GeForce 840M]). every time i install the Nvidia driver i have a black screen at the next boot, so i need to format again ! which causes me a huge pain ! this is what i get from (sudo lshw -C video)\n *-display               \n   description: VGA compatible controller\n   product: Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller\n   vendor: Intel Corporation\n   physical id: 2\n   bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n   version: 0b\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n   configuration: driver=i915 latency=0\n   resources: irq:60 memory:f7400000-f77fffff memory:d0000000-dfffffff     ioport:f000(size=64)\n\n\n*-display UNCLAIMED\n       description: 3D controller\n       product: GM108M [GeForce 840M]\n       vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:08:00.0\n       version: a2\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress cap_list\n       configuration: latency=0\n       resources: memory:f6000000-f6ffffff memory:e0000000-efffffff memory:f0000000-f1ffffff ioport:d000(size=128) memory:f7000000-f707ffff\n\nAnd this is what i get when i run lspci | egrep 'VGA|3D'\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 0b)\n08:00.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM108M [GeForce 840M] (rev a2)\n\nAny idea how to get this Nvidia card work without getting the black screen again?

Thank You!\nThese links helped in the answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Idea of changing driver to modesetting from intel\n2.Modern way to install nvidia drivers\n\nA: You have a system that likely uses the Intel hd graphics most the time to save power. This uses nvidia-prime to switch using Optimus technology. For some reason nvidia-prime would cause me problems as well, leaving me with a black screen every time unless I switch to Intel mode (when your screen is back press ctrl-alt-F1, log in, then key in:\nsudo prime-select Intel\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo service lightdm start\nAt this point you should at least have your desktop back. What I suggest you do is install NVIDIA drivers but not nvidia-prime, or remove nvidia-prime, and install Bumblebee. This may work better for switching you graphics. \n\nA: Give this a shot:\nFirst purge the drivers you have in there with:\n\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nThen add the ppa for Bumblebee:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen install Bumblebee and Nvidia:\n\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia primus nvidia-346\n\nAnd potentially remove prime because I read it doesn't work with Bumblebee:\n\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-prime\n\nThen reboot and cross your fingers. Hopefully this works. I personally was working on these drivers for a week with my GeForce 860M trying to get it to work right.\nEDIT: Use nvidia-340 if those are the drivers that the nvidia website said you should use with your card. I just used 346 because they are the latest and compatible with the 860M\n\nA: Certain Nvidia drivers do not work very well with certain GPU's, you have to use trial and error with apt-get to find ones that work well, this was the case for me when I had this exact problem. The one I found to work for my GTX745 was nvidia-331-update-dev, nvidia-331-update also worked, but nvidia-current and nvidia-current-update did not work for me at all, neither did most of the others.\nIf none of them work, go here: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us\nInput your computers info and it'll tell you what driver to get. Download it then follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter your tty command line (can be done by using ctrl+alt+f1, to go back, ctrl+alt+f7) Side note, if you're using a laptop, you might need to also use the fn key. \n\n*In the command line, login, it will prompt you enter a username then password. Once your logged in, enter this sudo service lightdm stop This stops the x-server allowing you to install the downloaded nvidia drivers\n\n*Navigate to the directory of the downloaded driver, then make it executable by using this chmod +x \"drver.run\" without the quotes. This will make it executable and able to install\n\n*Next, just enter ./the nvidia driver to run it and allow it to install, it will prompt you every now and then, choose your answers based on how you want to install (I'd recommend install the 32-bit binaries when prompted if you're running 64-bit).\n\n*If no major errors arise, you should be good. Let me know what happens and I'll see what I can do.\n\n\nA: You can try removing edgers ppa and getting your drivers from mamarley. My 346 drivers from there work great. Not sure what is different but the edgers 346 didn't work for me but marley's did.\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mamarley/nvidia\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-340\n\n\nA: Finally i could figure this out !! \nthe answer is here http://www.noobslab.com/2014/12/use-nvidia-graphics-drivers-in.html \nThank you all for participating !!

I was trying to rename a file named 12F-XYZ.pdf to 13F-XYX_ABX.pdf.\nBoth the original and the required names have hyphens. I know that for spaces we use \\ to overcome problems, but what can we do in the case of hyphens or any other character that might be treated specially by the shell or by commands?\n\nA: As David Foerster pointed out in a comment, hyphens (-) are not treated specially by the shell. So as far as your example is concerned you can simply do:\nmv 12F-XYZ.pdf 13F-XYX_ABX.pdf\n\nBut if you have a space or literal escape character (backslash) or any other that needs to be escaped, you can escape those with either the escape character i.e. \\ or put the whole name inside quotes ' ' so that the content inside the quotes is treated literally.\nHere is an example:\nmv 12F-XYZ.pdf 50M -XYZ.pdf  ##Wrong\nmv 12F-XYZ.pdf 50M\\ -XYZ.pdf  ##Right\nmv 12F-XYZ.pdf '50M -XYZ.pdf'  ##Right\n\nA rule of thumb would be to escape it while in doubt.\nThis article on special characters would be a very good read for you.\nAs muru pointed out in comments, you could have problem in case of a leading hyphen as many commands treat arguments beginning with a hyphen as options. In that case you can use either of the following:\nmv -- foo.bar -foo.bar\nmv foo.bar ./-foo.bar\n\nThe -- indicates the end of switches for the previous command (in this case mv). Not all commands support -- so using the second option (./-foo.bar) would be more reliable.\n", "Q: Python.h found by locate but not by GCC I just wrote a simple C executable to check if Python.h is working or not\n#include<Python.h>\n#include<stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n    printf(\"this is a python header file included programm\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nObviously, it does not do much.

How do I get my executable working?\n\nA: You need to qualify your include \n#include <python2.7/Python.h>\n\nOr tell gcc where to find Python.h with the \ngcc -I /usr/include/python2.7/ program.c \n\n\nA: You need to provide GCC with the include path for the Python.h header. This can be done with the -I flag:\ngcc -c -I/usr/include/python2.7 sourcefile.c\nHowever, there is a better way: use pkg-config :\npkg-config --cflags python\nThis will output the flags that need to be passed to GCC in order to compile applications that use the Python headers and libraries.\nWhen linking, use the output of this command to include the appropriate libraries:\npkg-config --libs python\nYou could even combine both steps with:\ngcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs python` sourcefile.c\n", "Q: Grub halts on menu until enter is pressed I have installed an Ubuntu server and it stops on the Grub Menu until ENTER is pressed without timing out and using the default entry.\nAt first I thought that the problem was due to a reboot after a power outage, so I set GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT and ran update-grub.

Possibly this means that the default contents of ~/.profile ought to be changed.\nThe easiest thing you can do to fix it is, as you suggested, to only call tput if $TERM is set.\n\nA: \n--> MY WORKING SOLUTION FOR THE TPUT-PROBLEM:\n\n# when $TERM is empty (non-interactive shell), then expand tput with '-T xterm-256color'\n[[ ${TERM}==\"\" ]] && TPUTTERM='-T xterm-256color' \\\n                  || TPUTTERM=''\n\ndeclare -r    RES='tput${TPUTTERM} sgr0'       REV='tput${TPUTTERM} rev'\ndeclare -r    fRD='tput${TPUTTERM} setaf 1'    bRD='tput${TPUTTERM} setab 1'\ndeclare -r    fGN='tput${TPUTTERM} setaf 2'    bGN='tput${TPUTTERM} setab 2'\n...\necho ${fRD}\" RED Message: ${REV} This message is RED REVERSE. \"${RES}\necho ${fGN}\" GREEN Message: ${REV} This message is GREEN REVERSE. \"${RES}\n... \n\nThat way the tput command is still working as fine as possible and \nit makes no sense if it is an interactive or non-interactive shell...\n6a5h4\n", "Q: Use evolution instead of thunderbird in top toolbar area Is there any possibility to use evolution instead of thunderbird in the top toolbar area as email client?

I've googled, and found this solution, but it didn't change anything for me (i.e. I added \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\" to \"/etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\").\nI'm not sure what next steps I should take to solve this problem. I've read somewhere that updating the kernel might help I ran the command \"uname -r\" and got \"3.13.0-24-generic\" back, which implies i have the kernel version 3.13 and not the newest 3.18 according to this.\nIf anyone has an idea what to try next or can point me somewhere, that would be awesome.\n\nA: I would edit the file gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf and change\n options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1 to\n options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8 then save, exit, reboot\nThis should bring back the wifi speed \nYou don't need to worry about kernel 3.18 as if you use the software update program, it should install the latest Ubuntu kernel and I think that is 3.13.0-46 or -47 now.\n\nA: Try to change your WiFi channel on your router..\nsudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep \\(Channel\n\nwill output the most congregated channels.

I'm following this tutorial: http://www.howtogeek.com/114503/how-to-resize-your-ubuntu-partitions/ to resize my partition but Ubuntu is on a VirtualBox machine. I don't have enough room in my root hard drive, /dev/sda/1 to download an .iso from my Ubuntu OS(the download is 1.1 GB; I only have 337 MB left), so I decided to download the ISO onto my Mac and I transferred the .iso to my USB drive. When I turned on the Startup Disk Creator on my Ubuntu virtual machine, there are no .iso images displayed. \nBooting it from a CD isn't an option for me because in order to insert a CD into a Mac, I need a disk drive, which I don't have. \nI am now stuck and confused on what to do now. \n\nA: Here is how I think you can fix your problem.\nDownload Plop Boot Manager from here onto your computer with VirtualBox installed\nExtract the zip file.\nOpen VirtualBox, select the your Virtual Machine, click on \"Settings\" (The Yellow Gear).\nOn the sidebar settings window, click storage. Under \"Controller IDE\" click the empty disk (or add one if there isn't any).

In addition to providing\n  information about various devices and kernel subsystems, exported\n  virtual files are also used for their configuring.\n\nThe files in /sys are not real files, viruses will not infect them.

While I always thought that my notebook is getting hotter than I like, I noticed it to be very hot on very low cpu load. Below you'll find a detailed description of this behaviour.\nI may have a hardware issue here. But as the CPU does not get as hot on Windows (between 55 and 70 °C, usually), there has to be a misconfiguration on Ubuntu. What could lead to this obviously bad CPU control?\nThe behaviour\nThe below screenshots were taken with PSensors. The temperature of my two physical cores are gray (Scaling on the left). CPU load is yellow, fan speed is violet. Note that the fan speed and CPU load curves are relative! That means the highest point has the value of the repective maximum value listed below, the lowest point has the value of the respective minimum listed below. So the fan speed seams to be higher in the first picture than in the following, while it never got as low as in the first picture ever again.\nOne graph are always ten minutes of time passed. The first three screenshots overlap a little.\nFirst ten minutes after boot\nOnly listening to music through Nuvola Player, not using the PC. Notice how temperature increases and increases while the CPU load is always quite low. At the end it reaches 103°C ! Maximum value for this processor is 105°C…\n\nkidle_inject kicks in\nStill only listening to music. As the CPU almost reaches its maximum temperature. kidle_inject kicks in at 1 to force the CPU to cool down. Note that any additional CPU load is exclusively due to kidle_inject!\nAt 2, kidle_inject injects more than 70% idle time per core! The systems starts to freeze from time to time and gets very hard to use.\n\nFurther development\nI started using firefox to write this questions additionally to listen to music.\n3 kidle_inject leaves. The CPU rapidly heats up again.\n4 not much more than 2 minutes later, kidle_inject has to slow the CPU down again, as it already reached temperatures as high as 102°C again.\n5 kidle_inject leaves again. But not for long.\n\nAnd so on…\nSome 15 minutes later\n\nAnother 20 minutes later. kidle_injects now constantly injects idle time.\n\nTLP\nI use TLP.

It had been working fine until about a month ago when Netflix gave me error M7121-1331-6037 when I would try to stream. This is an error referring to non-supported OSs and when I've contacted Netflix for support they have insisted that Ubuntu is not and has not ever been supported (and that I should have verified any 3rd party claims with them). I have searched for this specific error, as well as the general problem, and all I can find are articles to the effect of \"Netflix supports Ubuntu now!\".\nMy question is if anybody has experienced this and what you did to solve it. Or, if anybody can verify that Netflix has been working for them under these circumstances. Or, any suggestions as to where to look next. Thank you for your time. \nP.S - I had previously used Chrome 37 Beta with the different user-agent to view Netflix. I have checked and this no longer works either.\n\nA: I just fixed this very issue as Netfix also stopped working for me. All I had to do was STOP using the \"User Agent\". Either remove it or just change back to the Chrome default agent. Once I did that it worked again. \nI'm on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with the updated lib3 libraries and Chrome (not Chromium) stable from the Ubuntu repositories google-chrome-stable v41.0.2272.76-1.\nI was previously using the Chrome dev version but changed while trying to solve this issue over the last week or so. I suspect that Chrome dev would have worked if I'd stopped using the User Agent switcher.\nHope that helps.\nHere is where I found the comment that the User Agent is no longer required.\nhttps://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7705700.html?sid=b5fe5df615927d44efe406b661b1f337\n", "Q: How can I install my printer by terminal?

However, as soon as it booted without the \"nomodeset\" option then it was behaving erratically, resulting in the desktop freezing or not even loading (I had set auto-login on the user account).\nAfter attempting to boot again using the \"nomodeset\" option, the desktop appeared without issue, the keyboard and mouse worked perfectly.\nFollowing the guide from https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/110971-definitive-intel-nuc-how-to-guide-surround-sound-over-hdmi-apple-remote-graphics-part-2/ I managed to install the Intel Graphics drivers.

That is when I didn't understand why it does not suffice.  \n\n*As it turns out, the nomodeset option you chose when launching the live CD is persistent, and was still active in my Ubuntu installation. To deactivate it, just follow this:  \nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nComment out the line with:  \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"nomodeset\"\n\nTo comment just add a # in front of the line, to save Ctrl+O followed by Enter, to exit nano Ctrl+X.\nAnd update grub config: \nsudo update-grub  \n\n⠀⠀6.

I am not an experienced Linux user. When I start Ubuntu, I cannot make my mouse work in the window that it operates; it disappears in the window most of the time. My keyboard works fine. I checked other questions on similar problems, but couldn't find a suitable solution. I cannot use mouse in Ubuntu (I installed it using my keyboard).\nHere are the two messages that appears when I start Ubuntu; the first one relates to keyboard (mostly), the second one relates to mouse:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have the Auto capture keyboard option turned on. This will cause the Virtual Machine to automatically capture the keyboard every time the VM window is activated and make it unavailable to other applications running on your host machine: when the keyboard is captured, all keystrokes (including system ones like Alt-Tab) will be directed to the VM. \n\n\nYou can press the host key at any time to uncapture the keyboard and mouse (if it is captured) and return them to normal operation. The currently assigned host key is shown on the status bar at the bottom of the Virtual Machine window. \n\n\n*The virtual machine reports that the guest OS supports mouse pointer integration. This means that you do not need to capture the mouse pointer to be able to use it in your guest OS -- all mouse actions you perform when the mouse pointer is over the Virtual Machine's display are directly sent to the guest OS. If the mouse is currently captured, it will be automatically uncaptured. \n\n\nAny advices?\nSolution Edit: I found one way to use mouse in the Virtual Box guest OS window. On the left above menu under the section Machine (on Mac) I clicked the button that says Disable Mouse Integration (Host key + I, Host key is left command key for me). After that I acted as if mouse integration was not available in my machine. Like stated in message 1 (in the above question) I pressed host key. I clicked capture in the box that appears. I can only use mouse in the window, when I want to use it in my host OS I need to hit the host key again. My new question is how can I make Mouse Integration really work?\n\nA: When people search for the issue mouse integration. In the 5.0.16 version there's a input menu. And there is the button mouse integration. Slightly differently placed than before...\nOtherwise another solution to 'SOLVE' the problem is to do this: \nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nThen add psmouse.proto=imps to the boot parameters in the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"psmouse.proto=imps quiet nosplash\"\n\nThen hit CTRL+X to exit, then Y to save your changes. \nTo update the setting:\nsudo update-grub\n\nAnd then reboot. This solution comes from this thread on Ubuntu Forums, credits: imrazor\n\nA: Did you setup the Virtualbox config correctly when creating the VM, i.e. did you select Ubuntu (64 bit) in the following dialogue?\n\nI had the same mouse integration problem when accidentally installing Windows 10 technical preview 32 bit using the 64 bit profile. (Also, the guest OS ran painfully slow.) After reinstalling with the correct profile, it went away (already during installation, the mouse was working fine).\n\nA: ... with an update to VBox 5.0.24 r108355 my \"pointing device\" setting in the \"motherboard\" tab changed to \"USB tablet\" ...

You will not get what you want by shouting out your problem (YOUR USING ALL CAPS), in fact you will probably get ignored, more then likely you don't have your BIOS configured properly to boot a USB drive to install Ubuntu, set that up first then try loading it. Just a suggestion maybe try testing out Ubuntu first before installing, unless you have tested it before and you know what your expecting. Also make sure you backup all your music files, video files and documents that you can't afford to lose as Linux uses a different file system (ex4) then Windows (NTFS) so in the process of installing it will format your hard drive and you will not be able to restore it.\n", "Q: How to use middle mouse button (or center click) to scroll in Okular?

Some people that are not satisfied with that have provided patches at the bottom of the bugs.kde.org page linked below that will change Okular's default behavior of zooming while holding the middle mouse button to scrolling: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219121\nPerhaps the patch from November of 2013 (from the link above) will help your situation. You can apply the patch to the source of Okular then compile a version that works the way you want. If the patch is for a version of Okular that is too different then you could study the patch and find which code needs to be changed manually. You may find Kompare to be useful for applying patches and comparing source files.

This is less useful in very long directories as you might hit the argument limit. xargs is almost certainly faster.\ngnome-open $(ls | ...)\n\nBut you shouldn't parse the output of ls in commands; both of those are rubbish.\nYou can roll all your searching and filtering into one command:\nfind -iname '*book_i_want*' -exec gnome-open {} +\n\nNote that this will recurse into subdirectories by default (different from the ls default) so either account for that or add -maxdepth 1 to the line.\n\nA: If this works:\nls | grep -i 'book_i_want' \n\nThen, so will this \ngnome-open *book_i_want*\n\nTo make it case insensitive:\nshopt -s nocaseglob\ngnome-open *book_i_want*\n\nIn fact, both of the above will work better than using ls since they can deal with any file name, including those with whitespace and strange characters, which ls can't. \n", "Q: How to upgrade Ubuntu release while keeping versions of already installed packages Sometimes it's important to keep current versions of already installed packages when upgrading Ubuntu release, let's say, from 12.04 to 14.04.\nI don't emphasize if it's server or desktop assuming this procedure should be same.\nStandard release upgrade steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo do-release-upgrade\n\n\nBut this will upgrade packages as well.\nIs there a way to keep versions of already installed packages?\nUPDATE 1:\n\n\n*\n\n*I will perform release upgrades remotely, so I will a need command line solution.\nIt's possible to check versions using dpkg, apt-cache policy (and maybe with aptitude, haven't tried yet).\n\n*I won't have any packages in remote computer's repository.

In the driver management I see only 3 primary partitions which are the C, D, E drive. The F drive is logical drive. I didn't find the missing primary partition so I deleted my D drive and thus made space for a new primary partition. \nWhen I began to install Ubuntu I created only 1 partition.

But i think i should create a swap Partition for my Ubuntu.\nWhat should I do now, my laptop has 4GB RAM.\nHere is my gparted snapshot.\n\n\nA: When you make logical partitions, they require one of your primary partition slots to be used as the base for the extended volume.\nIn this case, /dev/sda3 is the base for extended volumes, but /dev/sda5 is the only logical partition in there, and is using up the whole of /dev/sda3's storage.\nHope that helps!\nEDIT:\nThe first answer on this question should show you how to enable the partition for use as swap. \n\nA: 4gb ram is enough and there is no need of swap still if you want swap Shrink /dev/sda5 and create a logical volume of type swap.\n", "Q: How to create the command in bash?

The crucial question is: does your wifi work or not?\nAlthough I get this message at startup, my wifi works flawlessly. Every attempt to make the message disappear, ended in nothing or a non-working wifi. So, if you wifi works, I recommend to ignore the message (it appears with different kernels and on different linux distros).\n\nA: For me, it was because my computer's Broadcom wi-fi chip was not supported by the included open-source bcma kernel module driver. No wireless connection appeared when I ran ip link, so this definitely wasn't a transient error message. I identified the wi-fi chip by running the lspci -k command (note: might have to use lsusb if the chip is connected via USB instead of PCI), then finding the line (usually the last) saying:\n03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM4352 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 03)\n    Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc. Device 855c\n    Kernel driver in use: bcma\n    Kernel modules: bcma\n\nThe wi-fi chip is a BCM4352, and we're trying to use the bcma kernel module to interface with it. According to this page on kernel.org, the BCM4352 chip is not supported by the default bcma kernel module; you have to use the restrictively-licensed broadcom-wl kernel module instead. The installation process for this driver varies depending on your distro; here were the directions I used for Arch Linux.\nOnce you install broadcom-wl you'll have two kernel modules competing to service your wi-fi chip - wl and bcma. You can see this by running lspci -k and seeing:\n03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM4352 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 03)\n    Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc. Device 855c\n    Kernel driver in use: wl\n    Kernel modules: bcma, wl\n\nTo prevent conflicts you'll want to blacklist the bcma kernel module. I did this by following the directions on the Arch Linux wiki here, creating a file at /etc/modprobe.d/nobcma.conf containing:\n# Do not load the 'bcma' module on boot.\nblacklist bcma\n\nAfter rebooting you can run dmesg | grep bcma to check that it isn't loaded, and dmesg | grep wl to ensure wl is loaded (along with some messages about the kernel being tainted by the proprietary code!)\nI can now run ip link and see the wireless link exists:\n...\n3: wlp3s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\n    link/ether 54:27:1e:30:26:61 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n\n", "Q: Clone a disk to a zip file in 14.10 EDIT: I have reviewed the \"Duplicate claim\" and to be frank, it is not answering my query, like most of my questions, the existing duplicate question do not answer my query.\nBesides that, I am dumping Ubuntu as I am sick and tired of the persistent issues with it, things working one day then not the next and everything breaking after each update and I do believe the main reason I can't update is due to my system being knobbled :) \nSo enough is enough, I have found a stable version of software that does not contain spyware like Ubuntu does.\nHappy smoking guys.\nCiao.\n\nI have asked a couple of times on how to go about this cloning of a drive, I have been advised to use dd or cat but neither work, well dd worked but not as expected. The command I used was: \ndd if=/dev/sda | gzip -c > \"/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/ssd.img.gz\"\n\nThe result was an unusually large container (51.3GiB) for a very small image file (3.9GiB) and it took more than 10 hours to do. I was able to copy data from the drives with copy and paste in about 45 Minutes before I unmounted for the drive image to be completed.\nSo, to set things straight from the outset...\nDrive to be copied - SSD drive, 64GB on the tag, has two partitions, is referenced as /dev/sda/ with /dev/sda2 as the boot partition NOT MOUNTED\nDrive to have image dumped to - USB HDD, 2TB on the tag, has one partition with 144MB buffer at the end on /dev/sdc1 IS MOUNTED\nThe drives copied from and copied to are not used as a boot drive, the boot device/partition is on /dev/sdb1 (which is an SD Card) and neither device is used during the process. Yes the sda drive is unmounted, had to repeat that point as the first time around it may have been missed.\nEach time I am told that I should use dd if=/dev/sda | gzip -c > \"/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/ssd.img.gz\" the image results in a very strange file that is 51.3GiB and in that file is a 3.9GiB file thats the image!?!?! Ummm the drives are nearly full!\nEach time I try to do this using ZIP which is what I want and thats so I can access in Windows should I need to do a blanket reinstall and pull the files I need from the ZIP file, however when I use dd if=/dev/sda | zip \"/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/ssd.img.zip\" I get a message that the program has nothing to do!\nI have tried the same with the cat command and that results in errors stating that \"nothing to do!\" and despite pointing out my needs, I get answers that would over write the existing partition, not what I am looking to do.\nYes \"I have the ZIP libraries\", yes \"the drive to write to is mounted\", no \"the source drive is not mounted\", I have no storage issues, so the ZIP can be uncompressed format.\nCan someone help please?\n** EDIT **\nExcuse me for getting frustrated BUT does Ububntu have ANY software that works?\nMy problem is very simple to follow, I have an SSD that is 64GiB in size, it is about 98% full.\nI have followed examples online and by advice from here in askubuntu and everyone posts stuff like I have previously posted.\nThe image file made using dd resulted in a 51.3GiB file called ssd.img.gz, within that gz archive a file called ssd.img resides and it is 3.9GiB in size.\nNOW FORGET ALL THAT ABOUT THE CONTAINER...\nI want to make an image of a drive that can later access in a ZIP program, I have gzip and zip libraries, my preference is ZIP because windows can read ZIP files without any external program.\nHow can I make a useable drive image that I can verify as being the same so I can then repair / break the drive with the confidence that I can restore the contents as it once was.\nHow can I do that please?\n\nA: I think you are asking to be able to open this zip file and see the list of files in windows explorer when you browse into the zip.\nYou are using the words 'image file' which has meaning of which  you may not be aware. An image file is not something one can introspect without special tools. This is in direct contrast to the request for a zip file with which one can browse files. You seem to not want an image of a disk, you seem to want a zip file with all of that disks file contents.\nThere are a number of reasons why this is a bad idea, and why you have not received the answer you want. \n\n\n*\n\n*Zip format does not support unix devices. This means none of /dev/ will work and you cannot use this file to restore your system.\n\n*Zip format does not support unix file permissions. This means that most of your system will not work since executable files will not be marked as executable.\n\n*Zip format on non-unix does not support symlinks, it will not work.\n\n*Zip format does not support extended attributes. This is probably OK for simple use cases, and is another reason why we use tar and not zip.\n\n*This is not the standard normal unix, linux or ubuntu way of doing things.\n\n\nThose things aside, here is how to zip your filesystem:\nzip -ry '/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/ssdfiles.zip' /\n\nIt will likely not work because it uses /tmp, which will likely be full on your system, so tell it to use that same external drive as tmp using -b\nzip -ry -b '/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive' '/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/ssdfiles.zip' /\n\nGood luck.\n\nA: You can make the plain image file with:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/outputfile.img\n\nDon't append the .zip at this stage.\nIf you wish to reinstate this on a spare partition (sdx in example) to check it against the real /dev/sda, then:\ndd if=/path/to/outputfile.img of=/dev/sdx\n\nOnce you're happy that this is a good image (perhaps compare using diff command) then you should be able to zip your .img file, which will not have been affected by the previous dd command. Then:\nzip /path/to/outputfile /path/to/outputfile.zip\n\nOf course you can change filenames at any point.\n", "Q: Ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop iso image I try to download ubuntu-14.04.2 desktop from\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nBut after whole downloading the iso image, when I getting to burn it to a CD or install on a bootable USB it says not probable image. \n\nA: Run the command:\nmd5sum <download-filename>\n\nThen compare the output to the correct version of your download on this list\nThis checks that the file isn't corrupted in any way.\n\nA: Verify the image's checksum against the one provided by Ubuntu:\nb436b6d4c7de064652f30d783bda5b4e  ubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso\n\nYou can calculate the checksum by running md5sum [file].\n", "Q: Geany no support greek language I am using Geany for C programming.\nMy code contains some greek sentences,I set the Default Encoding to GREEK(ISO-8859-7), but when I try to execute the program the greek letters show up like this.\nWhat i should do to fix that?\n\nOS:Ubuntu 14.04.02 64 bit LTS\nGeany version:1.23.1\n\nA: I don't think it's a Geany issue.\nTry the following code:\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <wchar.h>\n#include <locale.h>\nint main()\n{\n    setlocale(LC_CTYPE, \"\");\n    fwprintf(stdout, L\"γειά σου κόσμος\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThe key line for me is setlocale(LC_CTYPE, \"\");.

You can install the package (gimp-webp) from this PPA:\n\nppa:george-edison55/webp  (Click here for instructions on using PPAs.)\n\nThe commands for doing this would be:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/webp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gimp-webp\n\nOnce the package is installed, open up the Gimp and you will now be able to export images to the WebP format:\n\nThe package is currently available for Trusty, Utopic, Vivid, and Wily.\n\nDisclaimer: I am the author of the plugin.\n\nA: There is a webp package in Software Center by which you can convert GIF to WebP via commandline.\nAlso there's a paint for KDE, KolourPaint, which can save images as WebP. \n\nA: 16.04 Fixed\nSince 16.04 imagemagick (or convert) does support webp, although it delegates to webp, so you need to install webp.\nsudo apt-get install webp\n\nBut importantly things like convert img.png img.webp do work now.\nBefore 16.04 convert simply gave a png or jpg as output. The result wasn't a webp format. (You probably got bigger filesizes because it converted jpg with default (higher) quality)\nThumbnails:\ndisplay 'vid:*.webp'\n\n", "Q: What does cd [-L] [-P] [-e] [-@] do? Out of curiosity I typed cd --help to see if there were any extra things you can do with changing directory, and it came up with \ncd: usage: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]\n\nWhat does each option do? I tried doing a DDG search but found nothing on these extra parameters.. could someone explain them before I try 'em and find that -L deletes all files found in that directory but doesn't delete the dir itself or something like that haha :-)\n\nA: Try help cd:\n Options:\n    -L  force symbolic links to be followed: resolve symbolic links in\n    DIR after processing instances of `..'\n\n    -P  use the physical directory structure without following symbolic\n    links: resolve symbolic links in DIR before processing instances\n    of `..'\n\n    -e  if the -P option is supplied, and the current working directory\n    cannot be determined successfully, exit with a non-zero status\n\n    -@  on systems that support it, present a file with extended attributes\n        as a directory containing the file attributes\n\n", "Q: What if 100 or more cron setup? Regarding cron jobs in ubunutu.\n\n*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/curl  --silent http://local001.erp/snippetbucket/scheduler.php\n*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/curl  --silent http://local002.erp/snippetbucket/scheduler.php>  \n\nWhat if I had similar 100 or 1000 entries in system, how does I got performance ?\nDoes it works all or fail  to execute some ?\nThis seems most important to understand when and how execute.\n\nA: Cron will simply execute all lines sequentially. It won't wait for one to exit to launch another. There might be a maximum limit but I doubt it, if you launch too many resource intensive processes, you'll just crash your machine just like you would if you'd run them manually. \nIf you have enough processes so that the time it takes to launch them all is more than a minute, then the subsequent processes might be launched at the wrong time (14:01 instead of 14:00 for example). Apart from that, I don't think there will be any other issues. \nA better question is why in the world you would want to do that via cron instead of writing a script with your 1000s of curl commands and running the script with cron. \n", "Q: Write Nginx Config as Unprivileged User I have a deployment script that gets executed by an unprivileged deploy user. To fully automate things, though, I have to write a web server configuration file to /etc/nginx/sites-available and symlink it in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled.\nI'd rather not change ownership or permissions for this particular directory so I've been trying to figure out a way to do this with password-less sudo access. Since I'm here, I guess it's pretty clear that I haven't had any luck.\nIs there any way to update my sudoers file such that the deploy user can write new files to those directories?\n\nA: You can try writing a NOPASSWD rule like so:\ndeploy ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/cp -t /etc/nginx/sites-available *, /bin/ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/* /etc/nginx/sites-enabled\n\nThen the deploy use would directly copy to the sites-available folder, after creating the configuration elsewhere, then create the link (without a target name being specified).\nThis might have loopholes too.\nOr you could write a script that manages all this, and have a single NOPASSWD rule with only that script.\n", "Q: VPN client for Ubuntu 14.04 I was used to use Kerio VPN client on Windows for VPN connections.\nWhat client do I have to use?

I’ve seen a lot of similar problems in this forum, but all of them are solved in a similar way, as they are related with the UEFI or Legacy mode. However, my laptop had Windows 7 preinstalled, and I installed Windows 8 later, and when I try to modify these options in BIOS I don’t find anything related with UEFI or secure boot (I’ve already checked a lot of forums but I realized this option doesn’t exist on my BIOS). However I found strange that the USB is detected in BIOS as “UEFI: USB Flash Disk 1100”. Windows 8.1 is installed in Legacy mode, and the partition is MBR.  \nAfter a lot of time trying in this way, I created a partition (shrink space in Windows, there are also a lot of tutorials on how to do it in this forum) in order to install linux in that partition. However, when I click “Something else”, all the space is detected as free space. It is, there are no partitions. The only idea I have is to create the partition by using this assistant, but as everything is detected as free space, I will indeed lose everything I have in Windows.\nAny idea? Thanks for the help!\n\nA: Chances are your partition table is damaged, or at least has something quirky about it that the Ubuntu installer doesn't like. The Ubuntu installer relies on libparted, and I wrote a Web page about this problem in parted and related tools here:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/missing-parts/index.html\nIf I'm right, the easiest way to fix the problem is to run fixparts, which comes with Ubuntu in the gdisk package. It might ask you some questions or simply fix the problem. You may need to type w to save the changes it makes (which it mostly holds in memory until you OK a change).\nNote that fixparts can't fix every problem that might cause the symptoms you're seeing. If you're unlucky you'll need to do more extensive repairs. If that's the case, you'll need to post detailed partition information, which you can obtain by typing the following commands:\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sda\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nIf you've got multiple disks, repeat those commands for all of them.\n\nA: In order to dual boot 8.1 must be in UEFI boot mode.  Legacy and UEFI cant run together.  Backup your data then install in UEFI mode.  UEFI sees only in GPT partitioning system where as CMOS is only able to see in MBR.\nUSB installs are UEFI only.  Where DVDs are CMOS only.\n\nA: I have already solve the problem, thanks to you all! \nI explain what I did in case someone else have a similar problem.\nEssentially I used fix part as Rod Smith said.

Is there some viewer that I can control from Python, using any kind of reasonable inter-process communication?\n\nA: Since you mention presentation slides, what about using OpenOffice or LibreOffice Impress? You can add Python scripting bindings to LibreOffice (in Ubuntu install the libreoffice-script-provider-python package) HOWEVER I don't know what LibreOffice can provide for calling it from \"outside\" processes. Presumably this might be even more \"brittle,\" depending on how it's implemented. The other scripting languages in LibreOffice (or OpenOffice) might be better supported, too -- I mentioned python just because it's there.\nIf you want to display existing .pdf files, you can import them into Impress (maybe via Draw).\n", "Q: record of swap/memory usage - how to do it? Here is a quick intro to the problem, but if you're interested only on the question, I think you may skip to the last paragraph.\nI have installed Ubuntu Mate on my laptop with the recommended amount of swap, (according this answer and this page and soem other things I read). According to my uses I figured that that should be enough (I have 5GB of ram so I set up 5GB of swap). However, whenever I check my swap space, I notice it is empty. Similarly, it is very hard for me to see my RAM with more than 50% use. This is making me think that I may have oversized my swap space (I don't need hibernation to be always possible btw). For me the only way to be sure is monitoring how much memory/swap I use on a daily basis.\nSo the question is: how do I monitor the swap/memory use on my system? (So I can open a file at the end of the week and be able to plot my memory and swap usage over the last days.) If that already exists (I haven't yet found anything), how do I access it?\nPS.: I would rather avoid writing a script that runs every x seconds on crontab and collect this information.\n\nA: You only use swap when:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're out of RAM. Inactive things in RAM are paged out to disk (in swap).\n\n*You hibernate. The entire contents of RAM is dumped in swap so it can be loaded when the power is back on.\n\n\nHaving some swap is very useful but you only need a big swap if you want to hibernate. Otherwise a couple of gigabytes as a reserve is good enough.\nAnd 5GB is a really weird number. RAM usually works fastest in equally specced pairs or triplets (depending on your system). You might get better performance from 2×2GB than 1×2GB+3×1GB (even though the second is more RAM).\nBut for long-term logging, there are a number of options. sysstat looks like the easiest deploy-and-forget.\n\nA: No script is required. \nThe math to do this with vmstat is fairly straightforward. \nvmstat X count where X is the delay in seconds and count is the number of stat reports (lines). so for 7 days (end of the week) so if the delay was 5 seconds you'd have 5x12(minute)x60(hour)x24(day)x7(week) resulting in a count of 604800x about 80 chars per line will result in a log file of approximately 48,384,000 bytes in size.\nThe command to do that is vmstat 5 604800 > swap.log Of course this means the machine is running 24/7. If the schedule is different or you prefer a smaller log file adjust the count and delay according to your requirements.\n\nA: The vmstat command provides all the numerical data you need (and probably more). You can let it run in the background and write its statistics to a file.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 on Parallels Desktop 10, Mac OS X 10.10.2: Parallels and/or Ubuntu update broke Terminal (no command-line prompt) I am running Ubuntu Linux 14.04 via Parallels (10.1.4) in Mac OS X 10.10.2 on a MacBook Pro. Today I received update notifications for Ubuntu (first) and then Parallels and stupidly installed them (I never learn; I have problems every time). \nNow when I open gnome-terminal (not the Mac Terminal, the Ubuntu one), I have no command-line prompt.  So I can't use gnome-terminal.  I have tried reinstalling Parallels tools, but nothing changes.  \nI don't know whether the Parallels or Ubuntu update created the problem, but I suspect it was the Ubuntu update.

I don't want to lose my current setup; it took ages to get right.  I would be grateful for any advice.\n\nA: That sounds like a syntax error in one of your shell's initialization files. The likeliest culprits are either ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile. The simplest solution is to make a backup of these two files and then overwrite them with the defaults. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new user. You will run the necessary commands as this user who, presumably, will have a working shell. Make sure you create the user as an administrator so you can run sudo commands.\n\n*Log in as the new user and run this command (change parallels to the original user name, the one who has the problem):\n for i in .bashrc .profile; do \n   sudo mv ~parallels/$i ~parallels/$i.old\n   sudo cp /etc/skel/$i ~parallels/\n   sudo chown parallels:parallels ~parallels/$i\n done\n\nThat command will rename .bashrc to .bashrc.old and then copy the default over from /etc/skel. Finally, it changes the ownership of the file to parallels since it needs to be owned by the target user. It then does the same for .profile\n", "Q: Can landscape be used to proxy package updates? I just installed a Landscape server and tried to update one of my clients -- it didn't seem to work.  So, I checked /var/log/landscape/package-changer.log on the client, It appears that my client is trying to fetch Ubuntu's repositories.\nThis is probably not the usual way of using landscape, but is it possible to configure things so my client gets the updates from the landscape server, not the Ubuntu repositories?\nMy client doesn't have access to the Internet directly.\n\nA: Landscape-only Solution\nThere is a feature in Landscape called 'Repository Management'.  This feature is a bit complex to use and is more intended for people who want to stage updates across all their lab infrastructure.  But, feel free to look it over at the following links:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.landscape.canonical.com/LDS/ReleaseNotes12.09#Repository_Management\n\n*https://landscape.canonical.com/static/doc/user-guide/ch09.html#idp51261860\n\n*https://landscape.canonical.com/static/doc/api/repositories.html\nJust keep in mind, it lacks a user-friendly view in Landscape.  That major caveat aside, it does work and is seamless from the client point of view -- even supporting private repositories (https).\nSquid Deb Proxy\nIf you are just wanting to do some proxying of the ubuntu archives though, you should look into squid-deb-proxy:\n# On the landscape server or any machine your client can see with internet access:\nsudo apt-get install squid-deb-proxy\n\n# On the landscape client (you may have to do this by hand the first time, i.e.,\n# download debs and use dpkg -i):\nsudo apt-get install squid-deb-proxy-client\n\nIf you are using public repositories (like the Ubuntu archive and Launchpad PPAs), this should just work.  But see the docs and the multitude of questions/answer on squid-deb-proxy here and on the forums if you need help getting things configured.\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu booting very slowly? I haven't used Ubuntu in some time, but as I booted it up again several minutes ago it took nearly 2 minutes to reach the login screen. I installed bootchart after that and did another reboot, and although Ubuntu booted up somewhat faster, I still would like someone to investigate this matter by looking at my bootchart below. Can anyone tell me what is going on? \n\n\nA: You have a VFAT check on your boot that is taking 10s before file systems can be mounted.  To get rid of these 10 seconds use one of the following two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the VFAT partition is a removable disk, attach it to a Windows machine and run a chkdsk  /f on that drive under Windows\n\n*If you don't have a Windows machine, download FreeDOS, install it on a USB stick and boot with that and then run the chkdsk /f from the DOS command line.  \nOnly if those solutions do not work should you: \n\n\n*\n\n*copy all data to another disk and reformat and copy back.\n\n\nYour network resolving seems to be slow: check your network and/or DNS server as well.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Steam font issue I had recently installed a fresh copy of trusty and are going to use steam again.\nInstallation was done easy, steam starts up fine but the result looks like steam is missing some fonts...\n\nI thought about missing mscorefont where steam is heavily using it but i installed that before\nsudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer \nReading package lists...

What's the easiest way to bump the version number for a package that shall be uploaded to a Launchpad PPA? \nFor instance, what I do now is that on each new release I unpack the previous *.debian.tar.gz, then open debian/changelog, copy/paste top-most entry: \npackage (1.67-1~precise~ppa1) precise; urgency=low\n\n  * New upstream release.\n\n -- Name Surname <email@smth.asd>  Wed, 19 Mar 2014 22:22:03 +0200\n\nThen modify 1.67 to 1.68, and manually change date to Tue, 03 Mar 2015, and save file. \nThere surely must be a simpler way to do this...\n\nA: After unpacking the *.debian.tar.gz file, you can use the dch commands to create new changelog entries. For example, dch -i would (probably) bump up the version to 1.67-1~precise~ppa2. You can instead use dch -v \"1.68-1~precise~ppa1\" to specify the new version.\nNote that dch can also take in another argument that represents the message for that changelog entry. For example, dch -v \"1.68-1~precise~ppa1\" \"New upstream release.\". You can append to an existing changelog entry by doing dch -a \"Another message.\".\nNote that all of the above commands leave the distribution as UNRELEASED, signifying that it's not ready to be released.

Essentially I have a 32GB USB stick, and what I want to create (in an ideal world) is a stick that will contain :\n\n\n*\n\n*A permanent install of Ubuntu (not the 'Try Ubuntu', as I want to\nsave drivers, applications, etc. to use each time).\n\n*A few other bootable ISO images (Windows 8 install disk,\nAntivirus tools, System tools, etc.).\n\n*And finally, have a separate space for general file storage.\n\n\n-I have seen guides on how to create a proper install of Ubuntu on a USB device, so I can do that, but then I can't have my bootable ISO images on the same stick.\n-I know about Your Universal Multiboot Installer (YUMI) Multiboot, which I haven't tried, but I believe I can use to install multiple bootable ISO images on the same USB stick, however this would only provide the 'Try Ubuntu' version of Ubuntu, so I would have to redownload applications, etc. every time I use it.\nI'm sort of trying to create an incredibly multi-purpose USB stick for all eventualities. \nAre my dreams possible?\nI've had a search through google and the forum, and I can find answers to pieces of my puzzle, but not how to do it all together.\nCould I partition my USB stick into three or four partitions and\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a full install of Ubuntu on one partition\n\n*Use YUMI to put all the bootable ISO images on a second partition\n\n*Use a third partition for general file storage?\n\n\nWould that work?\nCan I have two separate bootable partitions on a usb with YUMI on one of them? If so, any tips or advice would be appreciated.\n\nA: A Two Partition Solution\nYou may be able to get by with 2 (or 3 if you want a Swap) partitions, one for the Full Ubuntu and another for data storage and exchange. Full Ubuntu will install GRUB by default. Modify GRUB to add extra entries that point directly to iso files stored in the first partition along with Ubuntu.\nSee How to boot from non-Ubuntu live ISO images like Fedora or CentOS? for more details about how to add ISO entries in the GRUB.\nMethod\nFirst create a primary FAT32 partition in the beginning of the USB for storage. make it the size you want. Alternately, you may shrink the existing partition to the size of general storage partition you want. It is important that this be the first partition, as Windows will only recognize the first partition as the storage partition. The FAT32 format will ensure that it is compatible will most operating systems.\nSecond Install Ubuntu in the freed up empty space after the first partition. Also make sure the bootloader (GRUB) is installed in the correct USB and not in your hard drive or in the other USB if you are using a Live USB to do the installation from. Choose the whole disk for the GRUB installation. this will look like /dev/sdb, /deb/sdc etc. This will place grub in the MBR. Don't choose a partition such as dev/sdb1.\nThird Makes sure everything works so far. Plug the USB into a Windows computer and verify that storage space is readable/ writable.

It is not located by searching Nautilus. \nDoes anyone know what this is and how to get rid of it?\n\nA: It is a plug-in for Chromium browser.\nI guess it comes from google itself to introduce their payment system Google Wallet.\nI deleted this plug-in (the folder) at ~/.config/chromium/Default/Extensions/nmmhkkegccagdldgiimedpiccmgmieda.\nIs not new published.\n\nA: As locke said - Google Wallet is a plug-in for Googles payment system of Google Chrome(ium).\nWhat really happened was that the browser \"installed\" an application starter (a .desktop file) in the users directory:\n~/.local/share/applications/chrome-nmmhkkegccagdldgiimedpiccmgmieda-Default.desktop\n\nThis starter simply launches Chrome with the wallet app. Cairo-dock keeps an eye on /usr/share/applications as well as ~/.local/share/applications so it noticed the new application and informed us about it.\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nName=Google Wallet\nExec=/usr/lib/chromium/chromium --profile-directory=Default --app-id=nmmhkkegccagdldgiimedpiccmgmieda\nIcon=chrome-nmmhkkegccagdldgiimedpiccmgmieda-Default\nNoDisplay=true\nStartupWMClass=crx_nmmhkkegccagdldgiimedpiccmgmieda\n\nPay attention to the \"NoDisplay\" entry which hides this application in all menus.

I have been reading up on common ways in which people attack each other on the internet through things like DDOS attacks etc, and how one would defend oneself from such attacks, and I have come across the fact that with the Ubuntu ping tool there is a \"Flood ping\" option:\nping -f <WhatToPing>\n\nSo I would assume that there must be other uses for ping flooding then, other than the malicious DOS attack one, so that is really my question, in what circumstances would you normally use the -f option when not attempting to do something malicious?\n\nA: You can watch the dots from across the room while wiggling the cables to find the faulty connection.\n\nA: That's obviously ;-) to test whether your system hardening has worked out and that your TCP/IP stack will not be flooded by ping flooding any more …\nE.g. that your system won't keel over by dropping the enormous amount of ICMP packets that it receives.\n\nA: This can be used to check if the network is reliable or if it is overloaded. The usual one ICMP message per seconds would be too slow for such purposes. Please note that 100 ICMP packets per seconds is very far from being a DOS attack in today's networks. That is only about 150 KB/s even if you specifically send unusually large ping messages.\n\nA: In addition to the other answers listed here about confirming how well hardened a host is, I have used the ping -f as a poor man's bandwidth testing tool for very narrow links.\nMore comprehensive tools like Fluke and Iperf require a cooperating agent at both ends of your link, but if you wish to test bandwidth to a point on your network that cannot easily have a cooperating endpoint (such as a client's demarc router) then as long as the endpoint can at least reply to large ICMP echo packets then you can determine a lower bound to available bandwidth at that time.\n\nA: Long ago, I was in a university computer lab where we had... interesting wiring.  Apparently, the signal in thicknet is the same as the signal in thinnet and some engineering student had created what looked like a terminator for thicknet and thinnet smashed together... a barrel connector with 10b5 on one side and 10b2 on the other.  This was obviously not anything resembling a best practice in any sense of the word.\nThis worked, for some definition of worked.  Thicknet was a bit pickier about the standing wave in the wire than thinnet was, but we had a thicknet cable that went along one wall, this connector, and then thinnet on the other wall.\nThe problem occurred when we added machines to the thinnet side because we wouldn't get the standing wave right and machines would disappear from the network until we got the right combination of lengths of wire between the thinnet T plugs.\nThere was one machine (lets say it was at 10.10.10.10) that was plugged into a different part of the network (the 10bT part) so was completely unaffected by all of the other network changes.  When we would add (or remove) machines from the network, we would set up:\nping -f 10.10.10.10 > /dev/audio\n\nAs long as packets are flowing to the machine, the speaker was making noise.  Network not visible for that machine and its silent.\nAnd then go about trying different cables.  When all of the machines were chattering away, we were done.\n\nA: You can definitely use it for stress testing your own machine as others have said, however at the place I'm interning at the IT professional usually uses it when rebooting a machine remotely, when the machine is back online he will know because it will start responding to the requests.\n\nA: I've used ping -f in the past to see if my lines are dropping packets at higher rates and to see if router error counters are increasing. According to the man page only a 0 rate ( which is as fast as it can go ) can be executed by a super-user.\nI agree with others that ping -f is not a great tool to use for this purpose. Netperf, iperf or other bandwidth tools are much better.\n", "Q: E: Unable to locate package denyhosts As I use SSH, I would like to get the denyhosts that I read about here, but when using the command:\nsudo apt-get install denyhosts\n\nTo install it, I got this error:\nReading package lists...

The kaffeine window goes black when you click off focus and it looses window size when changing channels.\nThis is usually something to do with dependency issues. Making my own version usually fixes at least some of those issues. I have had the same problems compiling some versions of the kaffeine source. Anyway, just retried the github download with the path to Qt4 defined on the cmake - and at last, it compiles.\ngit clone git://anongit.kde.org/kaffeine\nI found the following fixed that error on my system, as it is to do with qt5 and qt4 library defaults changed. You have to specify Qt4 now.\ncd kaffeine  \nmkdir build  \ncd build  \ncmake .. -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/qmake-qt4 \n\nThat built and worked, but still found the sound dropped occasionally, so still some issues.\n", "Q: nm-applet wifi-issues on Lubuntu 14.04 on my 64bit installation of lubuntu (lxde) nm-applet has been working fine but since my latest installation of several updates (haven't updated for some weeks) it seems something broke and i can't seem to make use of nm-applet any more.\nwhile i am aware that there are several questions regarding disappeared nm-applet icons (e.g. this askubuntu-question) the proposed solution of manually adding nm-applet to the lxsession-autostart-settings did not help as the icon still won't show (and seems fixed to me as there is a default entry called Ǹetwork` that i believe to have been missing before), so i've reverted that back to no manual entry. \nafter some more fiddling around i've found a thread (can't find the link any more, sorry) where it was proposed to: \n\n\n*\n\n*remove Indicator applets from the shown/enabled Panel Applets\n\n*change the line Exec=nm-applet in /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop to Exec=dbus-launch nm-applet.\n\n\nafter doing so the nm-applet icon is indeed back and also does list available networks in range but when trying to connect to an encrypted wifi-network (didn't try non-encrypted) the applet acts as if its about to connect (animated icon) but then fails.\ni've removed the saved network-connection and created a fresh one (making sure i got all the settings and password correct) but still none of many tried connection-apptempt succeeds.\nany ideas about what i could do to diagnose the problem further or anybody else having the same issues?\n\nA: well, after further fiddling around with this issue i finally got everything back to work (meaning being able to connect to encrypted wifi-networks using nm-applet) but what led to the success is not entirely clear as i've tried several things some of which i am unaware of how to revert.\nthere seem to be four factors that (in some combination) lead to a solution for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*changing the corresponding line in /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop to Exec=dbus-launch nm-applet as mentioned in my orig. question\n\n*disabling the application Network that is listed in the autostart-tab in the Default applications for LXsession dialogue (i had re-enabled this before after it did't seem to help when disabled alone earlier!) and manually adding the entry of nm-applet to autostarted applications-list instead\n\n*removing the plugin Indicator applets from the LXpanel (right-click on panel -> Add / Remove Panel Items)\n\n*i then killed the nm-applet process manually after a system-restart and started it manually via terminal. this led me to a dialogue that did never show up before asking me to setup a keyring (-> password). after doing so and further trying with running nm-applet through sudo i ended up restarting my system and afterwards i could eventually connect to wifi-networks (after entering my keyring-password).\n\n\ni can't recall i've changed any settings that would require the explicit use of the password-protected keyring-storage but i'm thankful things are back to normal for me.\nhope this may be of help for some folks who happen to stumble across the same issues...\n\nA: I had the same problem on Lubuntu 14.04 after an upgrade. I tested parts of antiplex answer:\nkillall nm-applet\ndbus-launch nm-applet\n\nseemed to help. So for me it was enough to\n\n\n*\n\n*go to Preferences --> Default applications for LX Session --> Autostart,\n\n*uncheck Network and\n\n*add dbus-launch nm-applet\n", "Q: How can I reset ssh passwords in nautilus?

Plus, as said, it did work before.\nAny clue on how to re-enable Ubuntu to recognise Android again?\n\nA: I had a similar issue (which is why I ended up on this thread). My android device was no longer recognize by my computer, when plugged it was merely charging. I checked 'disks' as well and had a similar issue than described previously, and sometimes my device was not even listed. I didn't check the two other points described above but the problem may very well be identical. In my case it simply was a USB cable problem.

Is there any difference between normal ubuntu experience and chromebooks's ubuntu experience? (anything).\nTouchpad doesn't work out of the box, that's the main difference. You have to run some scripts for that or buy wireless mouse, which is what i did. Otherwise same.\n4.

I have tried several things (most of which suggestions from this forum), such as using testdisk, mkfs.ext4, mkfs.ext3, mkfs.ntfs and etc. At this point, as you can see, I don't really care about the files anymore. I would just like to be able to use my HD again. Any help is appreciated.\nPS.: some outputs you might find useful\n$ sudo mount /dev/sdb /media/wd/\nmount: /dev/sdb: can't read superblock\n\n$ sudo dumpe2fs /dev/sdb | grep superblock\ndumpe2fs 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\ndumpe2fs: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while trying to open /dev/sdb\nCouldn't find valid filesystem superblock.\n\n$ sudo fsck /dev/sdb \nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\nfsck.ext2: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while trying to open /dev/sdb\nCould this be a zero-length partition?\n\nThe command sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb outputs nothing.\nThe \"zero partition\" part cought my eye, but I don't know what to do with it.\n\nA: If it won't mount more then likely you have a bad sector (which is why you can't access your files), It's cheaper just to replace the hard drive then to spend time fixing it if that is the case, I would unscrew the case and just buy a 3.5inch drive and replace it. It's pretty simple to do that.\n\nA: Try mounting the first partition /dev/sdb1 instead of the device /dev/sdb\nLikewise for the other commands, use the partition.\nNow while it is possible to have created the disk without partitions, that's not likely, but if you did, then include the loop option in the mount command -- ie. treat it like a big file.  \n\nThe partitionless disk you created should be mounted with a loop option, something like:\nsudo mount -text4 -oloop,rw  /dev/sdb /mnt/somewhere\n\nHaven't done that but once, so might have left something out. The above assumes an ext4 type filesystem, use the type you used when you created the filesystem on the disk.\n\nA: Use the following command to completely wipe the first GByte of the disk:\nWarning: The command dd is the abbreviation of Disk Destroyer! Use with care!!!\nsudo dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/XdY bs=512 count=1G \n\nwhere X and Y are the correct parameters for the disk (Probably s and b) If I were you, I would remove all hard disks from this computer, except the faulty one, boot from a LiveCD and then execute the command!\nP.S.

I run Xubuntu 14.04 with a HP PSC 1315 printer, using hplip, and printing a document without the printer crawling to a halt is damn near impossible.\nAfter a system reboot, printing one page sometimes succeeds without much hassle, but on any subsequent printing (whether it be the next page of the same document, or a new document altogether) the printer just crawls to a halt. The printer header moves very slow, with many pauses in between, and it takes ages (too long to wait) to print a subsequent page. Furthermore, text in those subsequent pages is usually blurry at the right edges as well.\nI've tried too analyze the problem, but, frankly, the processes involved in printing a document are just too complex for me to figure out on my own.\nOne thing I've noticed though, is that a lot of print-related processes don't terminate, even if I cancel and clear all print jobs — I still see all kinds of printer-related zombie processes running in the task manager (multiple of the following):\ngs -dQUIET -dPARANOIDSAFER -dNOPAUSE ...\nHP 52 <username> ...\nhp:/usb/psc_1310_series?serial=<someserial> 52 <username> ...\n\n(And usually the latter of these processes keep hogging the CPU, at around 60%-80%, as well)\nIt doesn't really matter what software I use to print a document:\n\n\n*\n\n*LibreOffice Write\n\n*Evince (exported PDF from LibreOffice Write)\n\n*Mousepad (just a simple, plain text, multi-paged document)\n\n\nThe ways I've set up my printer is through:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > Printers > Add\n\n*sudo hp-setup\nWhat I did notice though is that sudo hp-check reports:\n\nwarning: ubuntu-14.04 version is not supported. Using ubuntu-13.10 versions dependencies to verify and install...\n\n... listing all kinds of incompatibilities and/or missing libraries.\nSo, before delving deeper into this problem, I guess my first question is:\nAm I just wasting my time in trying to get this printer to work on Xubuntu 14.04, because it is not supported?\nOr:\nIs it possible to get this printer to work on Xubuntu 14.04, either with or without using hplip?\n\nA: I don't have the same exact model as you, but I do have an HP printer which works just fine without the HPLIP.  I can print and scan everything just fine.  The only thing I cannot do is check my ink levels and do other HP specific stuff, but for other everyday stuff I have zero problems.\n", "Q: How to install mouse cursor?

I'm trying to concatenate the chunks into whole lectures, and several online discussions recommend MP4Box on Ubuntu. I use the following command:\n$ MP4Box -cat chunk1.mp4 -cat chunk2.mp4 -new lecture.mp4\n\nI've also tried\n$ MP4Box -add chunk1.mp4 -cat chunk2.mp4 lecture.mp4\n\nBoth videos play fine on their own. The problem is that when I concatenate the videos, I receive the following warning:\nWARNING: Concatenating track ID 1 with different PPS - result file might be broken\n\nThe resulting video, played using VLC media player, is inconsistent. For example, if I concatenate only chunks 1 & 2, the audio for both tracks is fine, but the video of chunk 1 is just a gray screen. Once it gets to what used to be chunk 2, everything works great.\nI ran MP4Box -info on each chunk, and despite the warning, they appear to have the same PPS. In fact, everything about their configuration appears identical. Those results are included below.\nOn Windows I used a one-click GUI tool (Any Video Converter Free) for this, and I didn't ever have to mess with the configuration settings. So I'm a total noob to merging video on Linux. Not sure what else to look for or try.

They will vary (randomize) the type of mpeg4 encoders used from lesson to lesson, vary the video and audio bit rate and change the length of the audio/video so stitching them together causes errors.  The problems you are dealing with now are just the tip of the iceburg on the games being played to make what you're trying to do hard.  Also the companies that sell video editing hardware often contribute bugs to open source software that can do these sorts of things, so there's that.\nHard way, free\nIf you're prepared to do battle with that hydra yourself, then first prep every single individual MP4 file to a standard encoding, audio/video bitrate, etc etc.  You can use online and free video and audio converters (be careful not to download viruses with this, as content creators often package them with software).  You will find one that works for one kind of file, and discover that it only works for most of them, but not all.  \nConvert each one of the MP4 files to an open video format like x264 so all the files are the same.  Then you can use MP4box to convert all of those into one target MP4 file.  \nI'm a programmer and I've written little hacks that do the job in a one-liner, but every 5 years or so everything changes and you have to go out and do it again.  On the plus side, it's a good way to learn about audio and video close to the metal.  This is a war between content creators and content consumers.  One of the fronts on the war on general purpose computing.\n\"MP-anything\" mp3, mp4, etc etc, is yoke-in-a-box.  If you want your videos to be playable in 5 and 10 years from now, convert them away to open source video encodings.\nEasy Solution\nOne solution I know works is purchase \"video editing software\" for money and they do battle with that hydra for you, then it's a matter of drag and drop your mp4 files, copy and paste.\n", "Q: How do I create a new user account?

The issue is with permissions in the /usr/bin folder. \nI need to install eclipse, and one of the steps mentions creating a eclipe.desktiop file in /usr/bin/applications directory.\nHere is the guide which I followed :\nhttp://www.krizna.com/ubuntu/install-eclipse-ubuntu-14-04/\nSo I am running this command to create this file \ngedit eclipse.desktop \n\nin the /usr/bin/applications \nBut when I try saving it, it says that I don't have the required permissions.\nI tried reading about this but not finding a satisfying answer- some said to use 777 permission but that is dangerous and I don't want to risk it. So what should I do? \nI assume that this may be due to the reason that I don't have root access to that folder (guessing). If that is so, how do I make myself the root user, because this is my personal system and I will be the sole one using this. \n\nA: use :\nsudo gedit eclipse.desktop \n\ninstead of\ngedit eclipse.desktop\n\nA standard user cannot alter most of the files or directories except those which are in home folder. In your question you want to modify a file located at /usr/bin. Thus super user privilege are required for modifying the file.\nHence using sudo before gedit solves the problem. \nsudo means superuser do, i.e. the user can do superuser operations for an interactive shell\n", "Q: booting problem with windows8.1 and ubuntu12.04 I installed windows8.1 on my new laptop after that i installed ubuntu12.04 as dual OS .\nnow i am able to use only ubuntu, windows is not booting.\nhow can i get my windows back to use as dual OS.\nBoth the OS installations are in legacy mode\n\nA: Follow these steps from Ubuntu :\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T Or Search Terminal in  Dash.\n\n*Enter the following command in Terminal :\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n(This will open grub configuration file in gedit.)\n\n*Edit the file and change following options as following (remove comments # before any of below lines) and save the file :\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10 \n\n*Run the following command in new instance of terminal :\nsudo update-grub\n\n*Restart your computer, you should be now able to boot Windows if you\ndid partition your system correct\n", "Q: Basic Shell programming question with && { Hi just wondering about the use of && and { } in this example down below, does it mean that if you use the && and follow by { you write a shell script without having to create one before hand? Thank you in advance\n$ mkdir -p lpi103-7 && cd lpi103-7 && {\n> echo -e \"1 apple\\n2 pear\\n3 banana\" > text1\n> echo -e \"9\\tplum\\n3\\tbanana\\n10\\tapple\" > text2\n> echo \"This is a sentence. \" !#:* !#:1->text3\necho \"This is a sentence. \" \"This is a sentence. \" \"This is a sentence. \">text3\n> split -l 2 text1\n> split -b 17 text2 y; \n> cp text1 text1.bkp\n> mkdir -p backup\n> cp text1 backup/text1.bkp.2\n> }\n\n\nA: The && notation is a boolean operator for AND, which means that it uses the result of the previous command and only executes the next command if the exit code from the first command is 0.\nSo this is a shorthand for:\nls a &> /dev/null && echo \"Done\"\n\nthis, which basically does the same thing.\nls a &> /dev/null\nif [ $? = 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Done\"\nfi\n\nthe { is for grouping commands to run, so  this:\nls a &> /dev/null && {\n    echo \"This will happen if\"\n    echo \"ls command returns 0\"\n}\n\nis a shorthand for this:\nls a &> /dev/null\nif [ $? = 0 ]; then\n    echo \"This will happen if\"\n    echo \"ls command returns 0\"\nfi\n\nYou can also do the same with the OR || operator so you get the else part of the if as well. Like this\nls a &> /dev/null && echo \"Done\" || echo \"No can do!\"\n\nAnd also combine it with the grouping of commands:\nls a &> /dev/null && {\n    echo \"This will happen if\"\n    echo \"ls command returns 0\"\n} || {\n    echo \"This will happen if\"\n    echo \"ls command returns other than 0\"\n}\n\n\nA: Scripts are files which contains many unix commands, you can either create a file containing your commands or write those commands in Terminal directly in {} .\n&& is used for executing the other command after previous command.\nIn you example,  \nmkdir -p lpi103-7\n\ncreates a directory with name lpi103-7\nand \ncd lpi103-7\n\nis used to change current directory to lpi103-7\nwhen you use \n&&\n\nit executes mkdir command followed by cd command\n\nA: && operator executes the statement to the right only if the one  to the left succeeded. So  mkdir -p lpi103-7 (create lpi103-7 directory) comes first, if successfully executed, we go to cd lpi103-7 (go to that directory) , and if that is successful, we will go to the next block of statements\n", "Q: can not enable wifi on Xubuntu Please read the question in full before marking it as duplicate, I have just installed Xubutu 14.04 on my VGNFE31H laptop\nThe laptop has two wifi devices.\nFirst: The laptop has a built in wifi card intel.

Interestingly, I could successfully change to passive from my external client, where I couldn't when I tried connecting on the server itself. However, the external client I used was another Ubuntu 14.04 server I have. When I tried to connect externally from one of my windows clients using FileZilla or WinSCP (on FTP mode), I was unable to connect AT ALL anymore (passive or active) and those failed connections don't show up in the logs at all either. The server that I was successfully able to connect with is on the same LAN as the windows client so any network issues should be present with both boxes. I was previously able to connect with my windows client using active connections but for whatever reason it's not working even with that.\n\nA: The new kernel module seccomp is used automatically by vsftpd since version 3.0.0. vsftpd is a bit buggy when using seccomp.\nAdd this line to the end of /etc/vsftpd.conf\nseccomp_sandbox=NO\nand restart the Server:\nsudo service vsftpd restart\n", "Q: Unable to connect to Remote Desktop? am trying to connect to a remote machine (Windows 7 OS) using Remote Desktop Viewer.\nThe protocol I'm using is RDP and Host is local IP of the machine I am trying to connect to.\nOn Windows I have allowed people to remotely connect to that machine.\nWhat protocol should I use ? What other settings do I have to do?  My OS is Ubuntu (12.04)\n\nA: The answer to your problems is remmina (GUI) or rdesktop (Terminal command which opens GUI after) before that You should install this package.\n\nA: Follow these steps for connecting to Windows from Ubuntu\nStep 1: Enable Remote Desktop Connections on your Windows PC\nIn order to allow other computers to connect remotely to your Windows computer, you need to enable the Remote Desktop Connection feature. To learn how to do this, read this tutorial: How to Enable Remote Desktop Connections in Windows 7 & Windows 8.\nStep 2: Install a Remote Desktop Client - Our Choice: Remmina Remote Desktop Client\nBy default, Ubuntu doesn’t come with a remote desktop client which supports the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) used by Windows operating systems for remote connections. You need to install one of the clients available in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nFirst, start the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nSearch for the words \"remote desktop\" and you will be shown all the available applications.\nWe preferred to choose Remmina Remote Desktop Client, a client which is very appreciated by the user community and is, at the same time, very versatile and easy to use.\nTo get it installed, select it and click Install.\n\nYou are asked for your password. Type it and click Authenticate.\n\nNOTE: please keep in mind that, in order to install software, your user account needs to have administrative permissions. If you are set as a standard user account, you cannot install any software.\nNow the application is downloaded and installed. Wait until the procedure ends.\nStep 3: Configure the Remote Desktop Session\nIt is time to start the Remmina Remote Desktop Client. Search your Ubuntu PC using the word remmina and click on the appropriate search result.\n\nClick the \"Create a new remote desktop file\" button.\n\nThe Remote Desktop Preference window is opened. Here you can configure the remote connection you want to establish.\nIn the Profile section, type the name you want to use for the connection. It can be anything you wish. Then, in the Basic tab, complete the IP address of the Windows computer in the Server field. Then, type the username and password you want to use to connect to the Windows computer. Be aware that the user needs to exist on the Windows computer. If you are using a Microsoft account on your Windows 8 PC, it is OK to fill in your email address and password.\nYou can also set the Resolution you want to use for the connection and the Color depth.\n\nNOTE: Selecting a larger desktop resolution and color depth can impact the performance of your remote desktop session. If you experience lag when connected to a remote desktop, try reducing the color depth or resolution.\nIf you want to share a folder existing on your Ubuntu computer with the Windows computer, simply check the Share folder box and select the folder you want to share from Ubuntu.\nAlso, for more advanced settings, go to the Advanced tab. There you can turn the sound on or off, share printers, disable clipboard synchronisation, etc.\n\nOnce you are done making all the settings, click the Connect button. When connecting for the first time, a new certificate is created for the remote connection. Click OK to accept it.\n\nAfter a while, if the Windows computer is turned on and connected to the same network, you should be connected to it.\n\nOnce you close the remote connection, Remmina Remote Desktop Client automatically saves it so that you will be able to reconnect at a later time, with a simple click on the connection name.\n\n", "Q: Corrupted /etc/adduser.conf My /etc/adduser.conf file got corrupted:\n$ less /etc/adduser.conf\n\"/etc/adduser.conf\" may be a binary file.

It also has the disadvantage to occupy main memory and to lose all previous log files, which hampers problem diagnosis. SSD drives really aren't that delicate when it comes to write cycles and a few log files don't result in enough data and write operations to reduce the life span of an SSD significantly. Very few SSDs fail because of write cycle exhaustion.\nI suspect that /var/log/syslog still exists, but only on the root file system, because rsyslog starts before /var/log is mounted. When you mount another file system at /var/log, its previous content is hidden underneath.\nAs a workaround you can bind your root file system somewhere else, which would allow you to inspect its content unshadowed by other mountpoints:\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/root\nsudo mount --bind / /mnt/root\n\nYou should now see other content in /mnt/root/var/log.\nP.S.: If you have an internal hard disk drive in your machine in addition to an SSD, you can mount /var from there. That's what I and many other people do and not mainly because of concerns about write cycles. The main reason was always, that a faulty program may accidentally write heaps of (log) data to /var and nobody would notice until the file system was full, at which point it would be difficult to alleviate the situation, if /var was part of /.\n\nA: You should create those files in /etc/rc.local file like that:\n# Restore tmpfs directories for logs. \n# Extend the following directories to your needs according to installed packages\nfor dir in apparmor apt cups dist-upgrade fsck gdm installer samba unattended-upgrades upstart ;\ndo\n  if [ ! -e /var/log/$dir ] ; then\n    mkdir /var/log/$dir\n  fi\ndone\n\n# Restore syslog files\nfor file in debug mail.err mail.log mail.warn syslog ;\n  if [ ! -f /var/log/$file ] ; then\n    touch /var/log/$file\n    chown syslog:adm /var/log/#file\n  fi\ndone\n\n# Set owners for the newly created log directories\nchown root:adm /var/log/samba\n\nAbove script goes before the line:\nexit 0\n\nThis script creates those necessary directories and files on system start. You can also optionally sync those directories using rsync on shutdown, if you need them to be persistent between system restarts.\n", "Q: How to create new Magic Cookie?

Will the installation disk guide me through installing the RAID or do I have to first install Ubuntu Server, then create the RAID or do I first create the RAID and then install the Ubuntu server. \nBecause I have an Intel mother board,I found this white paper document for Intel Rapid Storage Technology\n:\nThanks\nBill\n\nA: You need to set up your hard disks as RAID disks BEFORE you install any OS.  Be Warned this is not an exercise for the fain of heart.\nHere are the instructions I use (unfortunately I cannot remember the original source):  \nSoftware RAID\nRedundant Array of Independent Disks \"RAID\" is a method of using multiple disks to provide different balances of increasing data reliability and/or increasing input/output performance, depending on the RAID level being used. RAID is implemented in either software (where the operating system knows about both drives and actively maintains both of them) or hardware (where a special controller makes the OS think there's only one drive and maintains the drives 'invisibly').\nThe RAID software included with current versions of Linux (and Ubuntu) is based on the 'mdadm' driver and works very well, better even than many so-called 'hardware' RAID controllers. This section will guide you through installing Ubuntu Server Edition using two RAID1 partitions on two physical hard drives, one for / and another for swap.\nPartitioning\nFollow the installation steps until you get to the Partition disks step, then:\nSelect Manual as the partition method.\nSelect the first hard drive, and agree to \"Create a new empty partition table on this device?\".\nRepeat this step for each drive you wish to be part of the RAID array.\nSelect the \"FREE SPACE\" on the first drive then select \"Create a new partition\".\nNext, select the Size of the partition. This partition will be the swap partition, and a general rule for swap size is twice that of RAM. Enter the partition size, then choose Primary, then Beginning.\nA swap partition size of twice the available RAM capacity may not always be desirable, especially on systems with large amounts of RAM. Calculating the swap partition size for servers is highly dependent on how the system is going to be used.\nSelect the \"Use as:\" line at the top. By default this is \"Ext4 journaling file system\", change that to \"physical volume for RAID\" then \"Done setting up partition\".\nFor the / partition once again select \"Free Space\" on the first drive then \"Create a new partition\".\nUse the rest of the free space on the drive and choose Continue, then Primary.\nAs with the swap partition, select the \"Use as:\" line at the top, changing it to \"physical volume for RAID\". Also select the \"Bootable flag:\" line to change the value to \"on\". Then choose \"Done setting up partition\".\nRepeat steps three through eight for the other disk and partitions.\nRAID Configuration\nWith the partitions setup the arrays are ready to be configured:\nBack in the main \"Partition Disks\" page, select \"Configure Software RAID\" at the top.\nSelect \"yes\" to write the changes to disk.\nChoose \"Create MD device\".\nFor this example, select \"RAID1\", but if you are using a different setup choose the appropriate type (RAID0 RAID1 RAID5).\nIn order to use RAID5 you need at least three drives. Using RAID0 or RAID1 only two drives are required.\nEnter the number of active devices \"2\", or the amount of hard drives you have, for the array. Then select \"Continue\".\nNext, enter the number of spare devices \"0\" by default, then choose \"Continue\".\nChoose which partitions to use. Generally they will be sda1, sdb1, sdc1, etc. The numbers will usually match and the different letters correspond to different hard drives.\nFor the swap partition choose sda1 and sdb1. Select \"Continue\" to go to the next step.\nRepeat steps three through seven for the / partition choosing sda2 and sdb2.\nOnce done select \"Finish\".\nFormatting\nThere should now be a list of hard drives and RAID devices. The next step is to format and set the mount point for the RAID devices. Treat the RAID device as a local hard drive, format and mount accordingly.\nSelect \"#1\" under the \"RAID1 device #0\" partition.\nChoose \"Use as:\". Then select \"swap area\", then \"Done setting up partition\".\nNext, select \"#1\" under the \"RAID1 device #1\" partition.\nChoose \"Use as:\". Then select \"Ext4 journaling file system\".\nThen select the \"Mount point\" and choose \"/ - the root file system\". Change any of the other options as appropriate, then select \"Done setting up partition\".\nFinally, select \"Finish partitioning and write changes to disk\".\nIf you choose to place the root partition on a RAID array, the installer will then ask if you would like to boot in a degraded state. See Degraded RAID for further details.\nThe installation process will then continue normally.\n", "Q: Error 404 when trying to install the package linux-image-extra I am trying to install the package below on ubuntu/trusty64\napt-get install -y linux-image-extra-`uname -r`\n\nand getting the following error \nErr http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-security/main linux-image-extra-3.13.0-46-generic amd64 3.13.0-46.75\n  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.201 80]\nE: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/linux-image-extra-3.13.0-46-generic_3.13.0-46.75_amd64.deb  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.201 80]\n\nWhen I go to the url above I see the relevant file but with 77 in the file name instead of 75.\nhttp://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/linux-image-extra-3.13.0-46-generic_3.13.0-46.77_amd64.deb\nWhat am I missing here?\n\nA: Your sources might not be up to date.  \nsudo apt-get update\nor the mirror you are using might be out of date as referenced in this question.\n", "Q: How to read hardware temperatures and other info in Ubuntu So all the previous answers that I have found pretty much tell me to install lm-sensors.

You say \"they all crash\", but that is not very specific. Make sure you download the 0.10.0 source code tagged on GitHub and follow the build instructions (Link).\nIf it still crashes, it's either a bug in their bitcoind code (pretty unlikely?) or something went wrong during compilation.

A note\nNew question, since everything else on this matter appears to be outdated and/or conflicting. Hold your close votes, please :)\nThe problem\nOn stock installs of Ubuntu 12 and 14 Server, the going advice seems to be that the way you make DNS changes is to edit the interfaces file and add the dns- options there. Only problem is, on servers, where uptime is a concern, it appears the only way to force those changes to be be applied is to bounce the affected network interface with ifdown/ifup.\nI've got a large number of servers to make a set of DNS changes on, and I need to update their resolver configurations, en masse, without toggling the network interfaces in this fashion. I also need to make sure the changes stick after a reboot.\nThe problem is that all of these servers were built with the dns- options in the interfaces file, meaning that if I change resolvconf's head or tail files, I'll end up with a bunch of duplicate lines on reboot.\nThe process needs to be something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely eliminate the resolver configuration (it's all over the place right now)\n\n*Set the options to new, known-good values\n\n*Save those options so they are used by applications immediately, and so they'll be in place after a reboot.\n\n\nSo, a recap:\nWhat won't work\n\n\n*\n\n*Editing the lines in interfaces (requires an outage to recycle the interface)\n\n*Editing resolv.conf directly (won't take effect, won't be saved)\n\n*Editing the resolvconf head or tail files (won't take effect, will have duplicate lines on reboot)\n\n\nThe actual question\nIs there a way to effect a change like this, without interrupting service? Ideally, I could force resolvconf to go through its update process without toggling the interface.\n\nA: If you absolutely can't have resolv.conf be in an inconsistent state, here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"state\" of the resolver generated from the dns- lines in your /etc/network/interfaces is stored in /var/run/resolvconf/interface/(interfacename).inet - this file was truncated.\n\n*The same data (search, nameserver, etc, same stuff that's in a completed resolv.conf) was copied into /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail (the tail file had to be created), with an appropriate comment added so anybody that comes along later can see what happened.\n\n*The dns lines in /etc/network/interfaces were commented out\n\n*And finally run resolvconf -u to regenerate the /etc/resolv.conf from the tail file\nThis has the effect of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Decoupling the resolver settings from the network interface (which if you're on a single interface box is needlessly annoying)\n\n*Placing the resolver settings in a single purpose text file (the tail file)\n\n*Making the changes take effect immediately\n\n*..and having them persist after a reboot\n\n*And re-generating the system wide /etc/resolv.conf with resolvconf's notification mechanism intact.\n\n*...with no downtime :D\n", "Q: How to change environment variable LANGUAGE globally in kde My objective is to change globally the LANGUAGE var to en_US.UTF-8.

I am replacing my internal hdd in my laptop with a new one.

So I can skip backing up data to a third external hdd in the second way?\nThanks.\n\nA: The answer to your first question is yes, but then replacing your previous hdd with the newly installed hdd may cause severe problems.\nAs an example consider that you installed Ubuntu in new HDD when connected externally and grub was installed in old HDD, when you remove old HDD and replace it with new HDD, it won't boot any OS because grub is missing. \nIf you install grub on new HDD (during installation it would be something like /dev/sdb) and then replace internal (old) HDD with new HDD, grub won't again load since replacing internal HDD with new HDD would make the new HDD as /dev/sda but grub would find it in /dev/sdb which doesn't exist, hence, you won't be able to boot.\nThus, the safer method is :\n\n\n*\n\n*To make a back up of all data of your previous HDD on some external storage like USB disk\n\n*Replace the old HDD with new HDD.\n\n*Install Ubuntu on the new HDD.\n\n*Copy back up files from external storage (say USB disk) to the new HDD.\n\n\nHope it helps.\n\nA: As long as you ensure you install the bootloaded (grub) on the hard disk you're installing Ubuntu on, there is absolutely no problem!)\nI've even installed Ubuntu on an external hard drive on my own machine and then moved that to the internal hard drive of another machine multiple times and it just works (unlike Windows)\n", "Q: Whats the difference between SUDO and Changing to root If I issue a \nsudo /bin/bash`  \n[sudo] password for mark:\ncmp -bl /dev/blah1 /dev/blah2\n\nand using \nsudo cmp -bl /dev/blah1 /dev/blah2\n\nthen logging in as root?\nI don't see whats different, if issuing multiple command lines then rooting IMHO seems the logical option over typing sudo prefix to command lines.\nI have seen sudo -i being used to log in to root, that used to work but the last week its issuing an error.\n** EDIT **\nI logged in as root, issued the command\nmark@mark-zotac:~$ sudo cmp -bl /dev/sda \"/media/mark/Seagate Expansion Drive/SSD/ssd.img\"\n[sudo] password for mark: \nmark@mark-zotac:~$\n\nIt ran, took about 30 minutes to run but produced zero as in nothing output. I am left with no indication of failure or success... So how do I know if the compare result was a success?\n\n\nA: The question has nothing related to difference between sudo and su.\nThe man page of cmp reads:\n\nThe cmp utility compares two files of any type and writes the results\n  to the standard output. By default, cmp is silent if the files are the\n  same; if they differ, the byte and line number at which the first\n  difference occurred is reported.\n\nSo no output means that the two files are the same.\n\nA: The following has been extracted directly from the community wiki page on root sudo.\nsudo allows user to act as root without root login; it is more secure to use sudo instead of logging in as root.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nBenefits of using sudo\nThere are a number of benefits to Ubuntu leaving root logins disabled by default, including:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The installer has fewer questions to ask.\n  \n*Users don't have to remember an extra password for occasional use\n  (i.e. the root password). If they did, they'd be likely to forget it (or record it unsafely, allowing anyone to easily crack into their system).\n  \n*It avoids the \"I can do anything\" interactive login by default. You will be prompted for a password before any  major changes can happen, which should make you think about the consequences of what you are doing.\n  \n*sudo adds a log entry of the command(s) run (in /var/log/auth.log). If you mess up, you can go back and see what commands were run.\n  \n*On a server, every cracker trying to brute-force their way in will know it has an account named root and will try that first. What they don't know is what the usernames of your other users are. Since the root account password is locked, this attack becomes essentially meaningless, since there is no password to crack or guess in the first place.\n  \n*Allows easy transfer for admin rights by adding and removing users from groups. When you use a single root password, the only way to de-authorize users is to change the root password.\n  \n*sudo can be setup with a much more fine-grained security policy.\n  \n*The root account password does not need to be shared with everybody who needs to perform some type of administrative task(s) on the system (see the previous bullet).\n  \n*The authentication automatically expires after a short time (which\n  can be set to as little as desired or 0); so if you walk away from the terminal after running commands as root using sudo, you will not be leaving a root terminal open indefinitely.\n  \n  \n  Downsides of using sudo\nAlthough for desktops the benefits of using sudo are great, there are possible issues which need to be noted:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Redirecting the output of commands run with sudo requires a\n  different approach. For instance consider sudo ls > /root/somefile will not work since it is the shell that sets up the redirections that tries to write to that file, not the command being run with root permission. You can use \nls | sudo tee -a /root/somefile\n\nto append, or\nls | sudo tee /root/somefile\n\nto overwrite contents. You could also pass the whole command to a shell process run under sudo to have the file written to with root permissions, such as \nsudo sh -c \"ls > /root/somefile\"\n\n  \n*In a lot of office environments the ONLY local user on a system is root. All other users are imported using NSS techniques such as nss-ldap. To setup a workstation, or fix it, in the case of a network failure where nss-ldap is broken, root is required. This tends to leave the system unusable unless cracked. An extra local user, or an enabled root password is needed here. The local user account should have its $HOME on a local disk, not on NFS (or any other networked filesystem), and a .profile / .bashrc that doesn't reference any files on NFS mounts. This is usually the case for root, but if adding a non-root rescue account, you will have to take these precautions manually. However the advantage of using a local user with sudo is that commands can be easily tracked, as mentioned in the benefits above.\n  \n  \n  Misconceptions about root login\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Isn't sudo less secure than su?\nThe basic security model is the same, and therefore these two\n  systems share their primary weaknesses. Any user who uses su or sudo must be considered to be a privileged user. If that user's account is compromised by an attacker, the attacker can also gain root privileges the next time the user does so. The user account is the weak link in this chain, and so must be protected with the same care as root.\nOn a more esoteric level, sudo provides some features which encourage different work habits, which can positively impact the security of the system. sudo is commonly used to execute only a single command, while su is generally used to open a shell and execute multiple commands. The sudo approach reduces the likelihood of a root shell being left open indefinitely, and encourages the user to minimize their use of root privileges.\n  \n*I won't be able to enter single-user mode!\nThe sulogin program in Ubuntu is patched to handle the default case of a locked root  password.\n  \n*I can get a root shell from the console without entering a password!\nYou have to enter your password.\nConsole users have access to the boot loader, and can gain administrative privileges in various ways during the boot process. For example, by specifying an alternate init(8) program. Linux systems are not typically configured to be secure at the console, and additional steps (for example, setting a root password, a boot loader password and a BIOS password) are necessary in order to make them so. Note that console users usually have physical access to the machine and so can manipulate it in other ways as well.\nSpecial notes on sudo and shells\nNone of the methods below are suggested or supported by the designers of Ubuntu.\nPlease do not suggest this to others unless you personally are available 24/7 to support the user if they have issues as a result of running a shell as root.\nTo start a root shell (i.e. a command window where you can run root commands), starting root's environment and login scripts, use:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*sudo -i     (similar to sudo su - , gives you roots environment configuration)\n  \n  \n  To start a root shell, but keep the current shell's environment, use:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*sudo -s     (similar to sudo su)\n  \n  \n  Here's a brief overview of some of the differences between su, su -, and sudo -{i,s}\n                HOME=/root      uses root's PATH     env vars\nsudo -i         Y               Y[2]                 N\nsudo -s         N               Y[2]                 Y\nsudo bash       N               Y[2]                 Y\nsudo su         Y               N[1]                 Y\n\n[1] PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games  (probably set by /etc/environment)\n\n[2] PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin\n\n\n", "Q: E: Unable to locate package nemesis I read about nemesis here, and I wanted to install it, but when trying to install the package with:\nsudo apt-get install nemesis\n\nI get this output:\nReading package lists...

Depending on the header file in question and the program you are trying to compile, you have a couple of options:\nTarget software exists in the Ubuntu repositories\nSometimes you want to compile from source a package already provided by Ubuntu (to get a different version, perhaps, or to patch it). If the software hasn't changed too much, you can use apt to get the dependencies:\nsudo apt-get build-dep <package-name>\n\nThis should install all the packages needed to build the Ubuntu package of that software (which may have fewer or more packages than what your source package actually needs).\nIf you only need to make some minor change in the source, or apply a patch, you might even be able to save a significant bit of effort by letting apt and dpkg do the legwork:\nsudo apt-get build-dep <package-name>\napt-get source <package-name>\n\nThis will download the source files of the package, including everything needed to make a package of it. The files will be in a directory named <package-name>-<some-version>. Enter it, make all the changes you want, and then do:\nsudo dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc\n\nThis creates unsigned binary package(s) in the parent directory (cd ..). You can then use dpkg to install these packages:\nsudo dpkg -i  <package-name>_<some-version>_<architecture>.deb\n\nExamples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing one build option in a package\n\n*Can't edit plugins/sudoers/ins_*.h\nTarget software is not present in the Ubuntu repositories\nYou can still try your luck with the specific header file missing. Use either the Ubuntu Packages index (the option to search the contents of packages) or apt-file to search for the file. Sometimes multiple packages may provide similarly named files, in which case, prefer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Files in /usr/include.\n\n*Packages of your architecture (use uname -m to know what your architecture is).\n\n*Any specific versions your software depends on (such as Qt4 instead of Qt5) - check the README and INSTALL files in the source (if present).\n\n*Packages whose names end in -dev, which typically include headers needed for compiling.\n\n\nSee: How do I find the package that provides a file?\n", "Q: Run cronjobs as root while Apache is running as a non-root user im building a simple Web Application which runs on a tiny device (Odroid C1 with Ubuntu Server 14.04).. the web application will use php.. my problem is that i want to create a \"Settings\" page where the user can customize, for example, local ip address or reboot/shutdown the machine .. basically i will need to run commands which need root user in general.

I am on MAC but I use Microsoft Remote Desktop to access my Windows at work, hence I've figured out that I could use it for XRDP on Ubuntu. \nWhat is the one easier and safer. I'm asking this because this is the Amazon subscription of my organization. Although i have administrative rights on the machine, I do not have access to the Management Console.

Also as you're workplace employes Windows, it would be better to use XRDP instead of VNC according to this answer:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/32495/whats-the-difference-between-rdp-vs-vnc\nwhich states that:\n*RDP is semantic. The RDP is aware of controls, fonts, and other similar graphical primitives. This means that when rendering a screen across a network, this information is used to compress the data stream significantly. For instance, if you know that this region of the screen if occupied by a button, with the color grey, then you don't need to send an image of the button across the network, but merely information such as location of this button, size and color.  \nVNC is \"dumb\" in this respect, and largely functions by sending the actual images across the network.\nRDP is tightly coupled to the Windows platform, where as VNC is availble for most platforms. RDP is also seen as far more performant then VNC, due to the semantic advantadge.*   \n\nA: The best solution for you is open a terminal and use the ssh -x command described below having XQuartz installed if you don't have X11 so that you can access the virtual machine with GUI.\nGet XQuartz from: http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/\nssh -x youruser@yourserverip.com\n\n", "Q: UEFI Boot Mode Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 8.1 UEFI I installed Ubuntu 12.04.5 on laptop (lenovo g4070 59417454) with existing Windows 8.1.

I have Windows 7 installed on my desktop. I have 2 hard drives. My operating system is on one and the other is media storage (NTFS). My family regularly streams media (using PLEX) to multiple devices in my house. I want to install Ubuntu on my primary drive so I can dual boot. If I do so, and I am booted into Ubuntu, assuming I have PLEX installed under Ubuntu, will my family still be able to stream the media from the NTFS media drive?\n\nA: Plex can use your local computer as a media server.  Your details sounds like you are already running Plex under Windows which is serving the media from the attached drives.\nYou can do the same thing if you install Plex to Ubuntu.  Ubuntu will be your server.  The devices is unaware of the server operating system.  It just receives the media streams from the server.\nYou can mount your NTFS media drives under Ubuntu and run the Plex server under Ubuntu no different from the way you're currently running it under Windows.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 9.2 Ubuntu 14.04 Full Link Quality Wireless Error Hey guys I am using Ubuntu 14.04 on my mac, \nAfter being on the wifi for around 5 to 10 mins it randomly shows the signal as being maxed but the internet stops working all together.

Uncomment these and reboot so that your system can update available repo's. Select 'software & updates from the launcher once you are back up and running, go to the other software tab and enable the extra repositories. You should be prompted to authenticate at this stage. Next, go along to the additional drivers tab.

The best would be if thunderbird had an android version, but I don't mind moving to a new synchronisation add on or mail client so long as I don't have to abandon the Ubuntu and Mint.\n\nA: For using android device, you should have a google account so that you may use Google Apps like Google Play Store. I suggest to you that you should make a gmail account, export all your contacts from your previous email (personal) in .csv format and then import these contacts in gmail by uploading .csv file.

Initially, I tried to uncompress with 7zip from terminal.  It goes through each file in the archive and for each file in the archive, says,\nExtracting   cover.jpg     Unsupported Method\n\nAfter doing some quick googling, I thought it was due to lack of .rar codecs, as it's not technically freeware or somesuch. \nAfter installing unrar, from the terminal I run\nunrar -x Books.rar\n\nAnd it goes through and just says \"Failed\" in the place of 7zip's \"Unsupported Method.\"\nI thought it could be a corrupt file or something, so I had a friend compress a random jpg as .rar and send it to me, and I encountered the same program.\nDouble clicking it opens unroller, which then promptly closes.\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Complement your installation of 7zip with p7zip-rar, the non-free rar module for p7zip:\nsudo apt-get install p7zip-rar\n\nA: Execute following command in terminal :\nsudo apt-get install unace unrar zip unzip p7zip-full p7zip-rar sharutils rar uudeview mpack arj cabextract file-roller\n\nThen extract any rar file.\nEdit : rar is provided in the multiverse component, so you must enable that repository.\n\nA: You can download the latest version off winrar for linux on their website.\nThen extract it with the following command (this is not a rar archive fortunately)\ntar xvf rarlinux-x64-6.0.2.tar.gz\n\nIt creates a folder named rarin which there is an executable of the same name. You can use it to decompress your archive.\nFor example if your archive is in the same folder as the rar folder.\n./rar/rar x Books.rar\n\nRemark: you may need to allow execution on the rar executable with chmod a+x rar/rar.\n\nA: You have to install some non-free packages.\nOn my Raspberry Pi running Raspbian I did the following:\n\n*\n\n*Uncomment the deb-src line in /etc/apt/sources.list\ndeb-src http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free rpi\n\n\n\n*Update\n# apt update && apt upgrade\n\n\n\n*Install unrar-nonfree\n# apt-get build-dep unrar-nonfree\n# apt-get source -b unrar-nonfree\n# sudo dpkg -i unrar_5.6.6-1_armhf.deb\n\n\n\n*Install p7zip-rar\nDownload the last version from https://packages.debian.org/buster/armhf/p7zip-rar and then run the following:\n# apt install ./p7zip-rar_16.02-3_armhf.deb\n\n", "Q: Adobe Photoshop Recently I have switched my OS from Windows to Ubuntu 14.04, but I need Adobe Photoshop to run for my project.  So how can I run Adobe Photoshop on Ubuntu, or are there any Ubuntu plugin like photo editor software?\n\nA: I'm an Ubuntu user caught in a similar situation with Adobe Creative Cloud [at school]. So if you must use Photoshop in Ubuntu ... then there's 2 options:\na.) Run Photoshop under Wine-HQ;\n\n\n*\n\n*Only certain versions of Photoshop and Wine-HQ work.\n\n\nb.) Use virtualization to run Photoshop in a Windows guest operating system.\nI chose virtualization. But found that there's drawbacks if you don't have the right hardware, or pick the right virtualization program to run a guest OS.\nThis is because Photoshop needs 3D acceleration and plenty of VRAM to work like it's suppose to, and not complain via pop-up warning .... So if you're on a production system, mapping out a game plan is a priority, to avoid tears later.\nFrom what I've come to understand, the best results for Photoshop with virtualization needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's standard system requirements.\n\n*CPU with Vt-d or AMD-virtualization(TM); and IOMMU\n\n*Enable Virtualization and IOMMU in Bios/UEFI\n\n*2 Graphics cards (1 is dedicated to the Guest OS. For instance, use onboard or integrated graphics for host, and GPU for virtualization).\n\n*And of course ... you gotta have power to run both the host (Ubuntu), and Windows guest (Win can be CPU hog when the guest is first turned on).\n\n\n\nNOTE: I can use Photoshop CC 2014 with only 1 Graphics card, and 256MB of VRAM in Virtualbox. But it prevents me from using 3D effects, etc.\nPS: I just read a post about Pixeluvo being a strong competitor to Photoshop (by an alleged \"pro\"). It's an inexpensive commercial app, with a native program for Ubuntu (see: http://www.pixeluvo.com).\n\nA: There is a vector image draw tool in Ubuntu called inkscape. Follow these steps to install inkscape.\nOpen terminal(Crtl+Alt+T) and execute following commands one by one\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/stable\n\nsudo apt-get update \n\nsudo apt-get install inkscape\n\nThere is another photo editor software (easier to use than inkscape) called gimp. Follow these steps to install gimp\nOpen terminal(Crtl+Alt+T) and execute following commands one by one\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\nCheck these tutorials for using inkscape (Click here)\n\nA: It's supposed to work on WINE but I tried installing it on CS6 and failed miserably on every try. However there is a much easier way:\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\nIt's got an installation script for Photoshop CS6 (works like a charm!), here it is:\nhttps://www.playonlinux.com/pl/app-2316-Adobe_Photoshop_CS6.html\nThere's also a script for Illustrator CS6.\nSupposedly those scripts might work with CC versions, but I haven't tested that.

I tried executing the executable file but nothing seemed to happen.\n\nA: You have to change the permissions of the executable file.\nSuppose you extracted .tar.gz to a directory utorrent in home directory and the executable file is named as utorrent-1.0 and it is in utorrent directory.\nYou will have to execute following set of commands for executing utorrent-1.0\nOpen terminal (Crtl+Alt+T) and execute following commands.\nchmod +x ~/utorrent/utorrent-1.0\n\nThe above command will add executable attribute on utorrent-1.0 file\ncd ~/utorrent && ./utorrent-1.0\n\nThe above command will execute utorrent-1.0\nThe example is arbitrary, replace utorrent with name (or path) of directory where you extracted files and replace utorrent-1.0 with executable file located in the said directory.\n", "Q: fail to install ubuntu server 14.04 64bit LTS from USB drive I created a bootable USB using Startup disk creator (in ubuntu desktop 12.04 32bit), from an iso image  of Ubuntu server 14.04 64 bit, when I want to boot another computer using this usb drive, The computer boots up, the installation process ok, it gets through the selecting the language, then it shows me the error that it can't mount the cd-rom to continue the installation, I tried several times with others USB devices but it shows me the same error.\nHow can I get this work ?\n\nA: With the installation CD ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso I ran into the same issue, for me it was as easy as running: umount /dev/sdc1\nMy tail -n 20 /var/log/syslog showed that the installer tried multiple times to mount /dev/sdc1 but since it was already mounted to /media that obviously failed.\nWith the above command I unmounted the USB-CD-Drive and the following attempt to automatically mount succeeded right away. After Alt+F2 just check what is currently mounted by issuing mount in the command prompt.\n\nA: This is how i got it to work. \nWhen it gets the CD-ROM error, move the install USB stick from one port, to another USB port on your PC. Then retry. \nThis worked. I don't know why. \nNot only that but I was reinstalling 14.04 later that night, and the CD-ROM error did not happen again. The 2nd install went without a hitch. \nYes it worked for me also.\n\nA: The steps here:\n\n\n*\n\n*At the third screen (don't wait until the next screen), hit Alt+F1, Enter\n\n*Type: df -h to get information where is USB flash disk located/ mounted. in eg.: \"/dev/sda1\" mount as \"/media\"\n\n*Type command mount -t iso9660 /media/ubuntu.iso /cdrom -o ro,loop\n\n*Then hit alt+F1 to back at main screen of installation\n\n*Finish. Now you can continue your process installation as usually.\n\n\nThe source is here...\n\nA: I solved this by using anther iso image !! I changed this image ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso and used this one ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso, and it worked like a charm using the same startup disk creator and the same USB. finally I think this is a bug in that version of ubuntu server, because I'm not the only one who get this error.\n\nA: Problem is that the new image isn't meant to be used with unetbootin or any of the normal USB creators.\nJust use dd like:\ndd if=ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=16M\n\n(obviously, replace /dev/sdb with the path to your USB key, but don't use any partitions (i.e. don't use /dev/sdb1, /dev/sdb2, etc -- just the whole device)\n\nA: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2253860 has an answer.\nHere are the steps that I took to get it to work \n\n\n*\n\n*When you get the error, Alt+F2 to a second console.\n\n*Find out which device your USB stick is (tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog)\n\n*If the device is busy, umount it (umount /dev/sd[abcdef]1)\n\n*Then mount it to /cdrom (mount -t vfat /dev/sd[abcdef]1 /cdrom)\n\n*Alt+F1 to get back to the install console, and try detecting again\n\n\nA: Ran into this problem as well with ubuntu-14.04.3-server-amd64.iso. Unmounting the /sda/ drive from /media and remounting it as /cdrom worked but I ran into installation error further down the line when it was trying to extract files for the install. The USB drive I was trying to install from was created with Linux Live (LILI) USB creator. I recreated the usb installer with Universal USB installer from PenDriveLinux and everything worked perfectly.\n\nA: Install GRUB2 on USB to boot Ubuntu Linux ISO\nAnother benefit is you can setup the GRUB2 to boot from different ISO. [See Multi-ISO below]\nSteps See pendrivelinux for details\nInstall GRUB2 to USB (assume the USB drive is on /dev/sdx1 partition)\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo mkdir /mnt/USB && sudo mount /dev/sdx1 /mnt/USB\n\n*sudo grub-install --force --removable --boot-directory=/mnt/USB/boot /dev/sdx\n\n*cd /mnt/USB/boot/grub\n\n*wget pendrivelinux.com/downloads/grub.cfg [1]\n\n*download the iso you want and rename it to /mnt/USB/ubuntu.iso. Make sure it's named ubuntu.iso and not the original ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\nNote: If you are using a 64-bit ISO, then you need to modify the grub.cfg. \nSee [1] below for detail\nDone.

This is a reliable method to create a boot drive, and all current Ubuntu iso files are hybrid iso files, including mini.iso and the Ubuntu Server iso files.\n\n*dd is straightforward, very powerful but also very dangerous. You can easily overwrite valuable data by writing to the wrong drive. mkusb wraps a safety belt around dd.\n\n*Install mkusb with the following command lines\nIf you run standard Ubuntu, you need an extra instruction to get the repository Universe. (Kubuntu, Lubuntu ... Xubuntu have the repository Universe activated automatically.)\nsudo add-apt-repository universe  # only for standard Ubuntu\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppa  # and press Enter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mkusb mkusb-nox usb-pack-efi\n\n\n*Lean alternative in Ubuntu Server: install only mkusb-nox\nmkusb-nox is a command line tool, that also wraps security around dd, and that does not want to install a lot of extra program packages, only pv.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppa  # and press Enter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mkusb-nox\n\nRun mkusb-nox for example with the following command line\nsudo mkusb-nox ubuntu-16.04.1-server-amd64.iso\n\nThe manual provides more details,\nman mkusb-nox\n\nLinks\n\n\n*\n\n*help.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\n\n*\n\n*alternate link to the quick start manual\n\n*mkusb-nox quick start manual\n", "Q: dpkg-checkbuilddeps fail to recognize installed packages I'm trying to build a package which depends (build depends) on several other packages. For some reason dpkg-checkbuilddeps shows some dependencies as if they were not installed, while in practice, they are:\n> dpkg-checkbuilddeps\ndpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: zlib1g-dev python\n> dpkg -l zlib1g-dev python\n.\n.\n.||/ Name                                      Version                   Architecture              Description\n\n+++-=========================================-=========================-=========================-===============================\nii  python                                    2.7.8-3                   i386                      interactive high-level object-oriented language (default version)\nii  zlib1g-dev:i386                           1:1.2.8.dfsg-2+b1         i386                      compression library - development\n\nNote that both zlib1g-dev are specified in debian/control without a version restriction.\nWhat goes wrong here?\n\nA: One possible reason for the discrepancy is that the installed packages for zlib1g-dev and python are of the i386 architecture, while your base system is something else; probably amd64 (aka x86_64). Unless your build dependencies are explicitly marked as being satisfiable by a package from a different architecture, those packages you have installed wouldn't count.\nThe ability to install packages from multiple architectures simultaneously on the same host is a relatively new one in the Ubuntu/Debian world, which may have contributed to your confusion. If it helps, you might want to read through https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultiArch.\n", "Q: Is there a faster way to only occupy disk space than dd In order to test that our systems correctly detect that they are running out of space, we just need large files on the disk where we do not care about their content at all. At the moment we use dd if=/dev/zero [...] to create them which takes awfully long especially when writing multiple hundreds of gigabytes to consumer grade SATA disks.\nIs there a way to speed this up? I'm thinking of just writing the information that the file exists to the file system table without writing the content of the file, ending up with a huge file containing whatever was written on the disk before.\n\nA: I think that the limitation will be the write BW of your disks. Anyway, it is important too to choose the right blocksize: \n⌂89% [romano:~/tmp] % time dd if=/dev/zero of=test1.tmp count=2M\n2097152+0 records in\n2097152+0 records out\n1073741824 bytes (1,1 GB) copied, 12,6078 s, 85,2 MB/s\ndd if=/dev/zero of=test1.tmp count=2M  0,37s user 3,18s system 27% cpu 12,721 total\n⌂86% [romano:~/tmp] % time dd bs=1M if=/dev/zero of=test1.tmp count=1k\n1024+0 records in\n1024+0 records out\n1073741824 bytes (1,1 GB) copied, 11,671 s, 92,0 MB/s\ndd bs=1M if=/dev/zero of=test1.tmp count=1k  0,00s user 1,10s system 9% cpu 11,783 total\n⌂64% [romano:~/tmp] % time dd bs=100M if=/dev/zero of=test1.tmp count=10\n10+0 records in\n10+0 records out\n1048576000 bytes (1,0 GB) copied, 10,3397 s, 101 MB/s\ndd bs=100M if=/dev/zero of=test1.tmp count=10  0,00s user 1,16s system 11% cpu 10,457 total\n\n...as you can see the speed is more or less limited to around 100 MB/s, but the CPU usage varies wildly (the default blocksize of dd is 512 bytes). \nThe correct solution is fallocate, as in the linked duplicate.  \n\nA: If you use BTRFS, you can easily decrease your file system size:\nbtrfs filesystem resize <size> <mount point>\n\nMaybe you should set up a test instance in an LXC container or chroot with limited file system space, thus you could test out-of-space and other conditions there.\nIf you really want to go the way to create a big file, I don't know of a way faster than dd, though theoretically one could assign free blocks to a file without actually writing to those blocks. Though this would need some filesystem-level hacking – maybe fallocate does that, though I never used it.\n", "Q: Package upgrade hangs forever on mysql-apt-configure Yesterday it got stuck with an update for MySql. The mysql-apt-config didn't finish for ours so I had to shut down the machine in the end.\nToday it suggested the same update again, but told me that I had to use dpkg --configure -a to fix the package first. When I do this it again hangs:\n# sudo dpkg --configure -a\nmysql-apt-config (0.3.3-1debian7) wird eingerichtet ..\n\nLast line in german means roughly \"[...] is getting prepared ...\".\nI've also tried to remove the mysql package with apt-get purge mysql - but this leads to the same result. It again hangs at the same step.\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: I had got the same problem a few hours ago. First I've killed the stuck process (kill -9 PID, or complete restart) then I completely uninstalled mysql.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common\n\nor\nsudo apt-get remove --purge mysql*\n\nThis will uninstall all mysql related packages, what is in most cases a bit overkill...\nBe careful to make a copy of your databases before do this or simply don't delete the database when the uninstall process asks about it.\nThen restart again (or kill the process of mysql-apt-config) and remove the mysql-apt-config package.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-apt-config\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAfter these steps I installed again everything solved the problem.\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql\n\nI'm not sure but probably it's enough to reinstall only mysql-apt-config.

Also, I don't really like what the shortcut ctrl + shift + t does.\nWhy is this happening? Is this the expected behaviour?\n\nA: Encounter the same issue after upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04. It took me sometime to find the \"preference\" window as the solution mentioned above in Ubuntu 16.04. In case some other people have the same issue, I share the way to find the preference window. \nYou can find the preferences by: open a terminal, at the terminal right top are the hidden tabs -> terminal ->Preferences\n\n\nA: This seems to be a newer version of GNOME Terminal update (>3.10). When you open the preferences dialog, you should see something like this:\n\nWhen you set the \"open new terminals\" setting to \"Tab\", the new terminal action will now open a new tab in the same window instead of opening a new window.\nThe old behaviour regarding tabs seems to have been changed in 3.12 and 3.14, for some reason.\n\nYou seem to have updated your GNOME components with a version that does not ship with Utopic, so you should expect to see it break.\n\nA: From what i understand you want the user@hostname to be in your window title, is that correct ?\nFor example the user bellow has dad@emachineubuntu in his window title.

I have a t440s with a full HD touch-screen. For normal use it works great, so a big thank you to everyone who made this work out of the box!\nThe issue is that I also like to use it to \"sketch\" little drawings live in front of class to clarify my lectures (I'm a teacher). To do so, the built-in screen must mirror that of the projector, which includes using the latter's resolution. This varies from 800x600 up to 1280x1024 in our university.\nWhen changing to a smaller, non-native resolution the touch screen no longer maps correctly to the picture on screen.

But when I upload it to PPA, the trusty AMD64 build fails for some reason, tough the i386 build succeeds as well as both AMD64 and i386 on precise.\nI've looked at the build log from PPA, and compared it to the precise AMD64 build:\ntrusty AMD64 build log\nprcise AMD64 build log\nThe first difference I see is that after completing dh_clean, the trusty build says debian/rules build-arch while the precise build says debian/rules build. After that the trusty build doesn't run make and as a result fails in dh_install, while the precise build has everything working.\nWhat is going on and how do I fix this?\n\nA: Part of the problem is that it's now expected that the debian/rules file either uses the newer dh_* target names (which this doesn't) or that there are build-arch and build-indep target names.\nIf you look in Ubuntu's debian/rules, you'll see that for Trusty, they've make a build-arch target that calls build-stamp, and made build depend on build-arch. This is a quick fix to the problem.\nAlternatively, if you want to switch to the newer dh_* targets, you can look at Debian's debian folder, and download the debian.tar.xz file from here. This should work on Precise and Trusty.\n", "Q: Unable to reboot into recovery mode and reset password Someone else installed ubuntu on my laptop, as a result i dont have the admin password. i'm unable to do anything without it. so i googled it, found some procedures and tried to follow that. but unfortunately i'm unable to boot into recovery mode, i tried holding down the [shift] key, but as soon as i press the power button to start my laptop, ubuntu logo comes faster than light and it takes me straight into the home. i also see a message when booting \"booting into insecure mode\". what am i supposed to do now? i have never used linux before, so i have no idea what to do. how to reset the password now? is there any other method? any kind of help would be appreciated. thanks\n\nA: *\n\n*do you have any information on the the laptop that you wish to preserve/save?\n\n\n*\n\n*if you don't, best thing to do would be to reinstall.

I had to replace one recently and ended up with a 292e. The 292e is supported in kernel 3.16, and requires firmware. so:\n1 - I installed kernel 13.16.0-30-generic from packages found in aptitude.  The new kernel boots up fine and the old 290 tuner is working.\n2 - I downloaded (from github) the firmware file dvb-demod-si2168-02.fw and copied it to /lib/firmware.  This is consistent with using the correct driver.\nThe result in syslog is that the new 292 tuner is recognised apparently correctly and then I get:\nsi2168 11-0064: si2168: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2168' in cold state\nsi2168 11-0064: si2168: downloading firmware from file 'dvb-demod-si2168-02.fw'\nsi2168 11-0064: si2168: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2168' in warm state\nsi2168 11-0064: si2168: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2168' in cold state\nsi2168 11-0064: si2168: downloading firmware from file 'dvb-demod-si2168-02.fw'\nsi2168 11-0064: si2168: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2168' in warm state\nsi2168 11-0064: si2168: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2168' in cold state\nsi2168 11-0064: si2168: downloading firmware from file 'dvb-demod-si2168-02.fw'\nsi2168 11-0064: si2168: found a 'Silicon Labs Si2168' in warm state\n\nNote that the device has been correctly recognised and is loading the correct firmware.\nI'm guessing, but doing it three times is not a good sign.\nIf I ask for a channel scan on the 292 I get the above messages ad infinitum.\nPlus, from MythTV, I get this, over and over again:\nmythbackend: message repeated 5 times: [ mythbackend[1893]: E SignalMonitor recorders/dvbchannel.cpp:1026 (GetSignalStrength) DVBChan[17](/dev/dvb/adapter1/frontend0): Getting Frontend signal strength failed.#012#011#011#011eno: Operation not supported (95)]\n\nThe 292 device appears as a new dvb adaptor but is not usable by MythTV.  I am following instructions from many sources.  Or maybe I'm not.  Lots of other people say it works, but not, apparently, for me.\nI am at a loss for what to do next - does anyone have any ideas?\n\nA: The problem was that I was using an out of date version of MythTV, for which I can only apologise.\nIt turns out that was assuming that the error messages were a function of the driver but, by installing the latest version of MythTV 0.27 the messages went away and MythTV was able to scan for channels.\nOne learning point - Use a scanner such as dvbv5-scan to confirm that the hardware and driver are or are not working.  I did this when I built the system in the first place, but forgot all about it.\nOne other point to note - the driver appears to load the firmware when the device has been inactive for a while.  The mass messaging about downloading firmware was presumably because MythTV was failing to get the device started properly.  I still get some of these messages, but not nearly as many as I first reported.\nI'm sorry to have put something up with such an obviously trivial answer, but thanks to those who looked at the question and gave it some thought.\n", "Q: black screen after resuming from suspend My laptop screen goes black after I resume it from suspend while using nvidia as default graphics manager, but when I use Intel graphics as default I dont have this issue.

However, upon doing rfkill list all I discovered that my Wireless LAN was hard blocked. This meant that something hardware-wise was interrupting.\nI remembered that there is a small switch on the back-right side of the laptop, near the SD card slot that hardware-switches wireless connectivity. The switch was on, so I SHOULD have been getting internet, but I tried flicking it to the opposite side, which of course changed nothing, but then returning it back to ON (which shows green by the left side of the switch) turned wifi on right away and I'm back up and running.\nSo, my solution recommendation is try messing with that hardware switch a bit if you run into this issue. It fixed the problem for me.\n", "Q: Wifi does not wake up when using Hybrid suspend in Ubuntu 14.04.2 I am trying to use Hybrid suspend in Ubuntu 14.04.2 .

I could either replace windows, or click something else. So I clicked something else, and made the partitions. However when I tried restarting the computer wouldn't load Ubuntu. It was just stuck on a black screen. So when I did a hard shutdown and restart, it took me back to the original installations screen. When I ran through all the steps again, I got the option of replacing Ubuntu with Ubuntu. I tried that and got the same results. Came back to the installation screen. I decides to try installing Ubuntu alongside Ubuntu. That didn't work either. Now the only options are too delete everything on the hard drive and install Ubuntu or something else. So now I have two copies of Ubuntu and (hopefully) one copy of windows. How can I get both of them (one of each) to run on the same machine from this point.\n\nA: Something else is the correct option if you want to dual boot ubuntu with some other OS.\nif you can try ubuntu with the bootable USB stick,then you can try to reinstall it.while installing it delete the partition which you install ubuntu last time and recreate it.\nas you mentioned that step was also failed try pressing left shift while booting.that will lead you to the grub menu if the installation was correct.if you proceed to that one then select advanced option(recovery mode) like something from the menu.then you can try on variuos options there.\ncorrect way to dual boot ubuntu with windows here\n", "Q: play video on ubuntu server I have ubuntu server running, no xorg,x11,desktop.

The install is located at /dev/sda10.\n\nI used dd to put the partition on an external drive. I don't know if this is the best way because information about how to do this is scattered all across the net which I find confusing. What should I do now? I'm planning on wiping the harddrive by putting a fresh Windows7 install on it but I don't know what to do next to get my copied Ubuntu system back as it was and make it dualbootable.\n\nA: Well first i would install a fresh version of windows 7. Then in Ubuntu installation you should make new partition for the Ubuntu in the /dev/sda10 and configure it I'm kinda new to Ubuntu bot hope this helps you out a bit :)\n\nA: The dd backup was the right thing to do. First fired up GPartEd to create a partition on the external disk that was larger than the partition containing the Ubuntu installation that needed backing up. Then opened the console and ran sudo dd if=/dev/sdaX of=/dev/sdbX bs=512 conv=noerror,sync.\nNext I reinstalled Windows7 and shrunk the Windows partition. Then I fired up a live DVD, from BIOS in UEFI mode (else boot-repair fails!) containing Ubuntu to create the new EXT4 partition for the saved Ubuntu install to live in. Then entered the following command in the terminal: sudo dd if=/dev/sdbX of=/dev/sdaX bs=512 conv=noerror,sync. When dd was done I had to check the partition with GPartEd because there was unallocated space within the partition of the install and create a new SWAP partition at the end of the disk. Then it was time to get GRUB back by using boot-repair:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nRan boot-repair and chose 'recommended repair'. After following instructions I was able to boot into my old and trusty Ubuntu install, yay. Only one thing left to do and that was point Ubuntu to the SWAP partition. Opened terminal and GPartEd, copied the UUID from the swap partition from GPartEd and from terminal launched the command: gksudo gedit /etc/fstab to edit the UUID of the new location of the SWAP partition that I copied from GPartEd. Saved, rebooted, all was back to normal.\n", "Q: Unknown display 14.04.02 LTS So as the install of Ubuntu i cant change the resolution in settings.

That you have an administrative account does just mean that you have the privilege to get root rights by using sudo for terminal programs or gksu/gksudo/pkexec for GUI programs.\nSo to have full access on the folders that are not your home, run your file manager (nautilus by default in Ubuntu) with gksu.\nOr: If you install the file manager nemo, you also get the option \"open as root...\" in the context menu of every folder.\nPlease do not enable the root account, as this is a big security danger.

I have got rkhunter version 1.4.2, and I was just wondering about the APT_AUTOGEN option which I currently have enabled.

It does not however update the file properties database with all new changes to the system, so if you did install a rootkit (not through APT), and then you installed some other software through APT (not a rootkit), then if you did a scan (with rkhunter) and the rootkit was a known rootkit it would be picked up, as only the software which you installed through APT would have been added to the file properties database, and not any other changes in your system.\n", "Q: apt-get: unmet dependencies, but dependencies can't install I'm in a spot where Ubuntu 12.04 LTS wants to do a dist-upgrade, but I can't do anything because /boot is full.\n~$ df -h\n/dev/sda1                               228M  227M     0 100% /boot\n\nI want to remove old linux kernels, using apt-get autoremove, but I can't, since I have unmet dependencies.\n~$ sudo apt-get autoremove\nReading package lists...

I have 3 USB webcams and 3 Arduino's plugged into the same computer. On startup, they are labeled /dev/videoN (N goes from 0 to 2) and /dev/ttyACMN (N goes from 0 to 2). So far, so good.\nThe problem is when something goes wrong with one of the devices (ie, the Arduino, its IDE, or the video capture program crashes). Then the device is assigned a new device file (like /dev/video3 or /dev/ttyACM3). I would like to keep the same device file instead. \nPlugging and unplugging the device does not help; neither does closing all the programs that should be interacting with it. If the problem occurs a second time, then yet another device file is created with an even higher number.\nIt's as if a handle to the old device file is floating around somewhere, and preventing the same device file from being reused. However, the original device file itself (say, /dev/ttyACM0) no longer exists, or at least does not show up in a directory listing.\nThe only way I have figured out to fix this problem is to reboot. Instead of rebooting, is there a way to purge any lingering references to the original device file so that it can be reused? Or, to force a total purge of all USB devices and renumber from scratch?\n\nA: I figured this out. Basically, when the device name is not reused, it means some process is still using the old device name. I thought I was closing everything, but there were some processes still running even after I closed all the visible windows.\nHere's how to find the process that is using the device name:\nlsof | grep /dev/ttyACM0\n\nThen, once I kill that process and power cycle the device, the device name is reused as desired.\n\nA: You can avoid much headache when you have to kill a process every time by writing  udev rules to add symlinks for those devices.\nSo whenever the device disappear, the symlink will die with it. Then if you replug your device it creates new node with incremented number ex:/dev/ttyACM1. However, the link gets created in the same path.\nSee How to distinguish between identical USB-to-serial adapters?\n", "Q: Help! Dropped computer! Grub showing up! How to bring back Ubuntu? I am running a dual boot win8 and Ubuntu 14.04 on a qosmio x875. I had my laptop in my backpack and the backpack fell out of my car. When I opened it much later I found that one of the back plates was slightly open (I lost a screw while fiddling with it long ago). I figured it hadnt opened far enough to do real damage (its a pretty tough computer). I then tried turning ir on. Got the ubuntu login screen. Couldnt log me in and froze with some weird plain text pop up of all squares. So i tried restarting it manually (power button). I get a grub bootloading screen. I've tried inputting exit and this takes me to a sort of bios in terms of where to access first. When I try to get into ubuntu it fails and goes back to grub. I can access windows just fine. I tried booting from the USB drive with my copy of ubuntu and that does not seem to be working. Any suggestions to bring back my beloved operating system?\nUpdate: good news. It appears I was able to get the USB working by simply rebooting from the BIOS. At least temporarily but when I checked disk for defects I got 2 file errors (but no elaboration on what they were exactly) should I try reinstalling? What should be my next course of action?\nUpdate 2: So I went into windows to look at the partition set up. Since I have two drives, one specifically for windows, one for Linux, I figured the both of them will pop up. I can't find the second drive in the partitions on windows...this looks bad.\n\nA: Looking at the specs, the qosmio x875 has the option of a 2nd disk, which I assume you have (not just a single drive partitioned for Windows and Linux). The fact that the system booted to Ubuntu initially indicates the Linux drive isn't (or wasn't) dead.\nThe only (normal) Windows program which would acknowledge the Linux drive would be Disk Management (usually in Computer Management) which should show it as Disk1, but with partitions of type 'Unknown'. It won't show in Explorer at all. If it doesn't show in Disk Management, then it's possible the drive has come loose. I used to have an Acer 8920G laptop with 2 drives and the drive bay cover had protrusions which held the drives in place. If your laptop is similar and the cover is loose, it's possible the drive has slipped slightly away from it's connector. I assume you have previously opened the cover and can check this; simply make sure both drives are firmly pushed into their connectors.\nIn normal operation, both drives are running whether you're in Linux or Windows, so using the laptop in Windows shouldn't be a problem as long as the Linux drive is either fully in place or, obviously, completely removed. Before running it for too long, check the drive isn't loose as a partial connection could cause problems.\nGood luck.\nP.S. You need to get a replacement screw for the cover plate or see about rearranging the existing screws so it can't come open.\n", "Q: Create a partition in Ubuntu I want to create a partition in Ubuntu with GParted as to install Windows 8.1 alongside Ubuntu.

With the CD Live, you have to reduce the space around half and then copy your partition with Ubuntu in the new free space (to clone). It's recomendable that you install, for precaution, the grub of this cloned partition modifying it for including the first partition and then initialize the system.\nVerify that you can boot the two Ubuntu partitions. After that, the first partition is eliminated by using again the CD Live and then install Windows. For dual boot, restore grub from the second partition of Ubuntu and modifying grub inputs for including Windows.        \n\nA: The problem is that you can't unmount the partition.\nYou should boot ubuntu's Live CD and open Gparted from there.\nThat way the partion won't be mounted and you will be able to resize it.\n", "Q: If I don't want to use Broadcom drivers, what are my options?

When I look at the /var/log/landscape/job-handler-1.log on the landscape machine is see over 100 errors about:\n\n2015-03-05 21:18:38 INFO root RetryingCall for '_get_nova_info' failed, trying 103 more time(s): \n  2015-03-05 21:18:38 INFO root Traceback: : Missing 4 nova-compute units\n  /usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py:783:__bootstrap\n  /usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py:810:__bootstrap_inner\n  /usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py:763:run\n  --- < exception caught here> ---\n  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twisted/python/threadpool.py:191:_worker\n  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twisted/python/context.py:118:callWithContext\n  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twisted/python/context.py:81:callWithContext\n  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/storm/twisted/transact.py:76:_wrap\n  /opt/canonical/landscape/canonical/landscape/model/openstack/jobs.py:751:_get_nova_info\n\n\n\nNOTE: The line number in jobs.py is off as I've added some print statements for debugging.  It's the assert in the _get_nova_info() function near line #741 (if memory serves), and yes I'm using the newest version of landscape as of today from the landscape ppa for trusty.\n\nSo I modified /opt/canonical/landscape/canonical/landscape/model/openstack/jobs.py's _get_nova_info() function to print out the length of the nova_compute_hostnames and I got zero. So I chased that into /opt/canonical/landscape/canonical/landscape/model/openstack/region.py's get_nova_compute_hostnames() and found that self.juju_environment.get_computer_ids().count() was also zero.  So I added a call to self.juju_environment.has_computers() and got false.  Then I ran self.juju_environment.get_juju_home() and got /var/lib/landscape/juju-homes/20.  (Yes this is my 20th attempt on my 2nd rebuild of the landscape box, I've been at this for awhile).  So I ran juju status utilizing the juju home mentioned above and all looked well. All 5 machines and services were started, no pending or error states. (including the 4 nova-compute nodes)  Any ideas?  I'm somewhat new to landscape, MAAS, JUJU, & python so my debugging is a bit slow.\n\nUPDATE 1:\nPer the request I've got the 2 logs (although my home is now #23)  juju status and broker.log .  I think I now know what my problem is per the snippet of broker.log below. (Thanks dpb for pointing me there)  My MAAS machine is giving out the DHCP address to my landscape LXC, but my landscape LXC is not in the MAAS controlled DNS as it's not provisioned by MAAS.  Therefore the provisioned machines cannot connect to the landscape server by name.  \nSo that leads me to a related question, is there a good way to have MAAS auto update the DNS with machines that aren't provisioned (or under MAAS control)? If not I'll have to give it a static IP outside my DHCP range and manually set the DNS.\n\n2015-03-06 17:09:50,665 INFO     [MainThread] Broker started with config /etc/landscape/client.conf\n  2015-03-06 17:09:52,382 INFO     [MainThread] Starting urgent message exchange with https://landscape/message-system.\n  2015-03-06 17:09:52,389 ERROR    [PoolThread-twisted.internet.reactor-1] Error contacting the server at https://landscape/message-system.\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\n   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/landscape/broker/transport.py\", line 71, in exchange\n     message_api)\n   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/landscape/broker/transport.py\", line 45, in _curl\n     headers=headers, cainfo=self._pubkey, curl=curl))\n   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/landscape/lib/fetch.py\", line 109, in fetch\n     raise PyCurlError(e.args[0], e.args1)\n  PyCurlError: Error 6: Could not resolve host: landscape\n  2015-03-06 17:09:52,390 INFO     [MainThread] Message exchange failed.\n  2015-03-06 17:09:52,391 INFO     [MainThread] Message exchange completed in 0.01s.   \n\n\nUPDATE 2:\nMy setup is a bit limited as I was only given 6 machines (5 nodes and 1 controller) to show the capabilities of OpenStack/Landscape so I can't use a dedicated machine for landscape.  I was using the landscape-server-quickstart in a LXC on my MAAS controller so I can quickly blow it away and start over fresh.\nso I blew away the landscape setup and set the LXC to a static IP, then modified the DNS (controlled by MAAS) to have the static DNS entry for my landscape server.  Then I installed Landscape Dedicated Server on the LXC using the landscape-server-quickstart method mentioned above.  \nAfter this re-install (mainly to clean out all my debug mess) I was finally able to install OpenStack though landscape.  Thanks.\n\nA: The \"Missing N nova-compute units\" message is about landscape-client agents registered back to landscape, Check /var/log/landscape/broker.log on the missing units.\nUPDATE:\nAs you have correctly identified, things work smoothest if LDS (Landscape Dedicated Server) is installed to the same MAAS where your openstack will live, mostly because of network routing and DNS.  However, countless variations exist of a valid topology with routes between networks, etc.\nSome suggestions on things to try, please read them all.  In the end you will need to determine your deployment topology:\n\n\n*\n\n*For a test, deploy LDS to the same MAAS where your openstack will be -- just to check if things are working there.  Use the openstack-install tool, or the landscape-dense-maas bundle with juju-quickstart directly to facilitate this.\n\n*Your clients need to be able to reach LDS, as you have stated.  If they can route by IP to where LDS is deployed, you can tear down the openstack install, change your apache servername setting and try again.  juju set apache2 servername=IP_ADDRESS.  After doing this, follow juju debug-log, make sure all comes up OK, and make sure you can browse to the LDS GUI at that https://IP_ADDRESS/ URL.\n", "Q: how to manually provision juju on multiple servers Its been a while since I've been here here is the question...\nI have three servers, 1 x86 and 2 x64.

See how to create snappy apps for more details but the gist is to put your code and all its dependencies in a directory, add a meta subdirectory with a package.yaml and do snappy build directory. This will create a snap. Afterwards you test with snappy remote and finally you upload it to the store hence snappy install works.\n\nA: One simple way you can do this via the terminal is via the aplay command. \nYou would simply run aplay FILENAME.wav.\nNow, I'm not sure if Snappy core comes with that package, but if it doesn't, then you should be able to install it via sudo snappy install alsa-base.

When ever the 60GB SSD is removed it shows the grub rescue screen. \nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to how I can remove grub from the old SSD and move it to the new one? \nI am currently thinking that I should reinstall Ubuntu using a live USB and specify /dev/sda as the location of the boot loader. \n\nA: Only with Something Else manual install option do you get the choice on which drive to install boot loader into. So with multiple drives you always use Something Else. \nYou can use Boot-Repair's advanced options and choose an operating system and which drive to install its boot loader into. Or Windows into Windows drive and grub into Ubuntu drive. Or you can use Windows repair flash drive to repair Windows and when in Ubuntu install grub to sdb.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nYou did not want grub in sda, it that is 500GB drive but sdb the 60GB drive and only in the 60GB drive.\nreinstall from working (not liveCD/DVD/USB) system - first find Ubuntu drive (example is drive sdb but use your drive not partitions):\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nif it's \"/dev/sdb\"  then just run:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb\n\nIf that returns any errors run:\nsudo grub-install --recheck /dev/sdb\nsudo update-grub\n\nHow to restore the Ubuntu/XP/Vista/7 bootloader \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreUbuntu/XP/Vista/7Bootloader\n", "Q: Install Steam (Ubuntu 14.04) I get a similar (or not exactly the same) error as the person in this topic: Installing Steam in Ubuntu 14.10.  But I also can't seem to type my password (Ubuntu Pass that is) into the terminal. I have downloaded the .deb from DIRECTLY from the steam website and that doesn't seem to anything. \n\nA: There are two ways to install a .deb file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double click the file in your favourite file manager. This should ask for your password, then install the package.\n\n*Open a terminal, switch to the directory containing the .deb file (cd /path/to/directory) and execute \"sudo dpkg -i file.deb\". This might ask for your password on the terminal, and you should be able to just type it straight into the terminal. Be aware that there are no characters shown at the password prompt to prevent others from seeing it. So don't expect your password or even ****** to show up, just type it and hit enter.\nI installed steam through the Ubuntu Software Center though, and that was the easiest way at the time. If this fails now, maybe you need to enable the \"multiverse\" repository in the \"Software & Updates\" settings. It says \"Software restricted by copyright or legal issues\", because steam is not open source software.\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu on partition.

Even with USB installed, it wants me to reinstall Ubuntu every time, even though when I do that it says Ubuntu is installed and asks if I would like to install over it.\nI put everything on to the USB with a program in Windows (I believe it was called Universal USB Installer). when I try to boot without a USB, it brings me to a list of boot options, but no matter which I choose, the screen says the following:\nIntel UNDI, PXE-2.1 (build 883)\nCopyright (C) 1997-2000 Intel Corporation\n\nThis Product is covered by one or more of the following patents:\nUS5,307,459, US5,434,072, US5,732,094, US6,570,884, US6,115,776 and\nUS6,327,625\n\nRealtek PCIe GBE Family Controller Series v2.35 (06/14/10)\nPXE-E61: Media test failure, check cable\n\nPXE-M0F: Exiting PXE ROM\n\n\nA: Windows 7 typically have a hidden boot partition / Recovery Partition. Your bios will show the F9 Recovery option upon booting. The problem is where did you install the Grub boot loader. From booting from the USB you can inspect your hard drive and see all partitions. And remove them. You can probably use the whole drive. Do you use legacy 4 partition table or EFI with GPT partitioning scheme? Technical, right? Personally I went for dual boot from windows boot loader by shrinking windows partition and installing grub on new partition. This way enables windows and linux hibernation to work. But that is not the point here, you already have wiped the main windows partition, but what about the boot partition.

I have an Ubuntu web server running version 12.10, hosted on Digital Ocean.\nWhen I access it using gFTP, one of the directories is listed as being over 3MB in size:\n\nHowever, the directory is empty. I've tried showing hidden files and I don't see any.\nWhy is this folder reading as having three and a half megs of data if I can't see any files in it?\n\nA: The dot file, like every directory, contains a list of names for the files in this directory and their inode numbers. So if you once had lots of files in that directory (not unlikely for a \"tmp\" directory) that would have made the directory entry grow to this size.\nAfter the files are gone, the file system doesn't automatically shrink the directory file again.\nYou can experiment with this yourself by making a new empty directory, do ls -la in it to see the initial size (4096 on my machine) then touching a lot of files, which will make the directory size grow.\n(Yes I know that I'm glossing over/being inaccurate about a lot of details here. But the OP didn't ask for a full explanation of how EXT* file systems work.)\n\nA: Probably because you are not the root user and not in the root group...\nAsk the sysadmin of the ftp site to check (as root) on this directory.

addresses that have binary 1 in netmask must be same, that is, the networks network address should be the same. If the two devices, WiFi and eth0, are on different nets then they must have different net addresses.\nIn your setup, the network address for both nets are 192.168.0.0/16. So both units are on the same LAN. \nThere are also only one default router in a system. That is where packets should be sent if you don't have any route specified for that address. \nIf you really want the two devices to connect to different LANs, then they have to be set to different networks. That is, in your case the net mask should be 255.255.255.0, so wlan0 is on LAN network 192.168.3.0 and eth0 is on LAN network 192.168.10.0, neither should be on the same LAN network 192.168.0.0 as it is now. \nPlease install the program ipcalc and try out different IP addresses and netmasks as arguments.

The scripts download and install various Windows-specific libraries that your games might need and gets your game to be run by a certain Wine version - normally one that the script author knows works with the game - and certain Wine settings (such as whether the Wine runs in 'Windows XP' mode or 'Windows 7' mode).\nThe game installed with the specific libraries and Wine version are put into a 'Wineprefix' which is a certain folder on your computer which runs programs with those libraries and Wine version. These are located at ~/.playonlinux/wineprefix.\nOf course, understanding how Wine itself works is a different question altogether. You can learn more about Wine itself here.\nSources: \nOwn knowledge \nPlayOnLinux Wikipedia entry\n", "Q: What should I choose I want to install Ubuntu but I am confused between 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") LTS and 14.10 \"Utopic Unicorn\". \nWhich one I should choose as I am a developer for Android so I could have a completely stable environment.\n\nA: This is the tool recommended by Canonical for Android development (source) it's now called Ubuntu Make and it's a command-line tool for installing the latest version of the Android Studio and SDK along with all the required dependencies. It focuses on the LTS versions of Ubuntu (and, therefore, backports any updates that would be useful for Android developers to the LTS release of Ubuntu) since they realize that Android developers don't want to have to upgrade Ubuntu every 6 months, want stability but also want an updated development environment.\nTheir focus is on the LTS releases of Ubuntu so I recommend you install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS \"Trusty Tahr\" (and then install Ubuntu Make and Android Studio as described here).\n\nA: I think either are a good option the only difference really would be the former has long term support being a developer my self I would lean towards the newer,\nIf you feel you don’t require the long term support and are competent perhaps you should also.\n", "Q: Software similar to \"universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3\" that runs on Ubuntu?

I basically did sudo rm -r ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/\n3) Close and reopen gnome-terminal\nSelf- explanatory.\nSuggestions:\nFor good measure, try doing updatedb after deleting everything or after reopening gnome-terminal; try rebooting if it still doesn't work\n\nA: Whatever I did I couldn't get my fonts to show up. I got at a point where I tried switching random options, and when I switched \"Allow bold text\" off and back on all the fonts showed up. Don't ask me why but it worked for me.\n\nA: First see if the font is available in system by using fc-list | grep font-name.\nNow copy the font name correctly from the result of above command e.g.\n/usr/share/fonts/TTF/MonofurNerd/monofur Nerd Font Complete.ttf: Monofur Nerd Font:style=Book.\nFor this font name is Monofur Nerd Font which comes after .ttf:.\nNow open dconf-editor GUI version.\nNow navigate to the font setting of gnome-terminal.\n/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:some-id/\nHere :some-id is a long set of characters which refer to your profiles in gnome-terminal.\nThen find the font setting, and change the font name by the one you want.\nApply the settings and you are done.\n\nA: I solved it using https://superuser.com/questions/1335155/patched-fonts-not-showing-up-on-gnome-terminal link.\nOn Amazon Linux 2, I did the following,\n\n*\n\n*Installed gnome-tweaks\nsudo yum install gnome-tweaks\n\n\n*Ran gnome-tweaks\n\n\n*Fonts (sidebar) -> Monospace (select whatever font is needed). This selects the default font.\n\n\n*Close gnome-tweaks\n\n\n*Open gnome-terminal\n\n\n*Edit -> preferences -> Profiles (sidebar) -> Text -> Custom font (uncheck it i.e. use the default system wide font)\n", "Q: Not able to boot after installing ubuntu 14.04 on a brand new dell precision tower 5810 I've just acquired recently a brand new Dell Precision Tower 5810 with preinstalled  Win7 pro. It has 2 disks 4TB each. I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 as the primary OS wiping everything from the disks but when the installation is over and I try to boot from the Ubuntu entry under UEFI mode in bios the only thing that I get is a black screen with the following options\n\n\n*\n\n*Press F1 to reboot\n\n*Press F2 to reboot in to settings\n\n*Enter or change bios settings\n\n\nSteps I follow during the installation process of Ubuntu 14.04 on my machine\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot mode UEFI secure boot OFF\n\n*Boot from usb drive and install normally\n\n*At the partitioning step I choose the first option to delete\neverything and install Ubuntu as primary OS on drive /dev/sda\n\n*After installation I end up with 3 partitions on /dev/sda\n\n*\n\n*512MB efi\n\n*16GiB /swap\n\n*remaining free space as /ext4 / (root)\n\n\n\nAfter installation when I reboot it gives me a black screen with the message options I described above.\nHas anyone faced the same problems? I would never expect to be it so damn hard to simply install an OS in a brand new machine.\n\nA: I had this same issue with a Dell 5810. Turns out it was related to installing Ubuntu in UEFI mode. I was able to fix it by following the excellent advice from Ubuntu here and here. To summarize the advice from those two links, I did the below after I encountered the screen the OP mentions. \n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the PC using the Ubuntu install disk and selecting the \"Try Ubuntu\" option.\n\n*Once the live cd has loaded to the desktop installed and launched the Boot Repair tool in a terminal by doing:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair    \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n\n*Select the \"Recommended Repair\" option. \n\n*Rebooted.\n\n\nThere's probably a more elegant way of doing the install. However, this was pretty easy so I didn't investigate it further. \n\nA: Try this to gather more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R image for my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Create the relevant medium.\n\n*Boot with it. With any luck, you should see the rEFInd menu pop up, which should show an option to boot Ubuntu.\n\n*Boot Ubuntu.\n\n*In Ubuntu, open a Terminal window and type sudo efibootmgr -v.\n\n\nThe efibootmgr output will show your boot entries. Here's what it shows on the computer I'm using now:\n$ sudo efibootmgr -v\nBootCurrent: 0000\nTimeout: 1 seconds\nBootOrder: 0000\nBoot0000* rEFInd (direct)   HD(2,c00,114000,6e49fcaf-d054-47c9-ba69-a668c5ee8192)File(\\EFI\\refind\\refind_x64.efi)\nBoot0004* UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell  Vendor(5023b95c-db26-429b-a648-bd47664c8012,)..BO\n\nIn your case, you should see at least one ubuntu entry that points to either \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi or \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi. There may well be other entries, like the UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell entry in this example. Furthermore, the ubuntu entry's number should appear on the BootOrder line as the first value. (My output doesn't show precisely what I've described because I'm using rEFInd, not GRUB, as my default boot program, and I don't even have GRUB registered on this system. The Ubuntu Shim/GRUB entry would be similar to my rEFInd entry, though.)\nIf you do not see such an entry, you can try creating a new entry with efibootmgr:\nsudo efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 1 -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\shimx64.efi -L \"ubuntu\"\n\nAdjust the disk (-d /dev/sda), partition (-p 1), and the exact path to the file for what your system uses. There are also ways to do this using other tools; see this page for more information.\nIf you already see such an entry but it's not working, or if the entry you create disappears whenever you reboot, then chances are your firmware is broken. Workarounds are possible in such cases, such as installing the boot loader as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. In some cases, using bcfg from an EFI shell works even when efibootmgr in Linux doesn't work, so it may be worth trying that approach.\n", "Q: Bluefish won't run Bluefish worked for a while, but now I get:\n(bluefish:11390): WARNING **: Couldn't register with accessibility bus: \n  Did not receive a reply.

They insist that it was fixed in the latest version. First, make sure you have the latest stable version of Bluefish installed. Doesn't need to be the bleeding-edge final version, just suitable for your distro.\nIn my case it didn't worked anyway and I had this issue a couple of times. Basically, if you remove ~/.bluefish/session-2.0, it should work again.\n\nA: As the last contributor said, it involves the ~/.bluefish/session-2.0 file in your home folder.  to see this file, enable \"show hidden files\" by right clicking inside the folder and selecting \"show hidden files\".  Once there, open this .bluefish folder, right click on the session-2.0 file and select properties, select the permissions tab, tick the execute box and then the set sticky bit box, close, close the editor and all should work fine.  Can't explain why, but when the program creates or writes to the file, it is unsetting the execute permissions, setting the sticky bit seems to keep them set, and the program works again. \n", "Q: Replacing WIndows 8.1 within Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I am in the process of wiping my Windows 8.1 install and replace it with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but have the following queries pls, prior to doing anything:\n1) Will I be able to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my new Acer Aspire ES1-512 C32A laptop, which is a 64 bit OS, has 8GB RAM (upgraded it) and a 500GB HDD (7200rpm).

Even though the answers are for dualboot, you can choose to wipe Windows and replace it with Ubuntu at the time of installation.\nTo answer your questions...\n1) Will I be able to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my new Acer Aspire ES1-512 C32A laptop, which is a 64 bit OS, has 8GB RAM (upgraded it) and a 500GB HDD (7200rpm). Boot mode is set to: UEFI?\nThis is hard to say as computer manufacturers often use different internal components for different batches of the computer with same model number. The best thing to do is to boot from the Live USB you created and select \"Try Ubuntu without installing\". This option will not make any changes to your computer and you will be able to check if everything works or not.\n2) I have created a USB Flash drive install of Ubuntu using Universal Installer app - I believe it worked, even though it was stuck on 99% but when I pressed \"Close\" after 15 mins, it came back saying installation completed successfully - can I assumed this worked or can people suggest another installer ISO app?\nTry the Live USB without installing as mentioned above. If it does not work, try creating the Live USB again.\n3) When I restart my laptop and press the F2 key to enter BIOS mode, I switch over to Boot section and I am presented with Boot Mode of UEFI and then the option set boot sequence of drives, which would be my USB drive. My question is, what should the Boot Mode be when I go to change the boot order sequence - should it be UEFI or Legacy?\nFor a system that just boots Ubuntu, it does not matter if you choose UEFI or Legacy. The installation program will use the appropriate process. If you intend to use UEFI, at the time you choose the Boot drive, make sure you choose the USB with UEFI.\n4) If/when I eventually wipe Windows 8.1 and replace with Ubuntu, is there any special I need to do from my end?\nIf you select the option to replace Windows with Ubuntu during installation, it will erase everything in your hard drive including other partitions such as D:\\. If you have data, music, photos, etc. in another partition, copy them in an external drive before you start. You may also choose \"Something Else...\" and manually select the partitions for Ubuntu. This requires some knowledge of the partition scheme used by Ubuntu.\n5)Will things like Wireless LAN | SD Card Reader| Touchpad work straight off the bat or do I need to install specific drivers?\nMost things should work. Ubuntu has most drivers already built in. The two exceptions are graphics cards and WiFi cards. Even for these opensource drivers are built-in. If your WiFi card needs a proprietary driver, you connect your computer by Ethernet during installation and check the appropriate box to install these additional drivers at the install time. This can be also done later by running the appropriate program that looks for and installs additional drivers if they are needed.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: df is omitting some whole parts of my fs / disks.

It was literally the first time I used this new computer.  It connected to wifi no problem, and stayed connected, but every five minutes the browser window would disappear and I was presented with the login page that you see when you turn the computer on, and asked for my admin password.  as there seemed to be no way around it to get back to using the computer, I entered the password each time. \nNow I'm worrying that I just authorized the installation of malware.  Very computer-illiterate here, but simply knowing enough to know that windows has always been very annoying and ubuntu is much more simple and elegant.  \nthanks for your time.  \n\nA: Could it be related to no activity on the keyboard or mouse and the system locking the screen for security like in this Q&A: Brightness & Lock\n", "Q: How do I know if my system is frozen? I know Linux rarely freezes, but how can I know if it has?\nIt was not frozen, just not responsive, and started responding again after a while, it was chrome using too much memory. The question remains though.\nI have 8gb of ram, of which two are allocated to qemu, installing kali linux. The freeze happened when it was writing the system down to disk. I also had chrome opened with a BUNCH of tabs. Not even the clock is ticking. Also, since I have an HDD I was using cfq as the disk I/O manager. And I use amd's proprietary driver.\nIn those cases (actually frozen system), should I wait for my system to resume, or use one of the methods described in this link, that one of the answers here provided?\n\nA: freezing means you cant do anything in the desktop even a mouse pointer movement.\nthis link may help you in such cases.\n", "Q: My problem is \"I have to move the cursor (mouse) more up and to the left (1 cm) of the link that i want to open, for really open the link\" I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS with the respectives updates.\nThe problem is very simple, but really i want solve it. I suppose that is related with the mouse configuration.\nWhen i clic any link, tab of any window, cell in Openoffice, the clic does not execute.

I have to search the correct place to do it.\nThe problem affects thunderbird, firefox, openoffice, videos program, etc. With firefox is enough to request advise to solve it.\nThanks and regards\n\nA: I don't think the mouse is to blame, but the resolution and position of your monitor. I observed something similar on my laptop with an external monitor connected and fiddling around with standby and switching profiles. Just opening system settings helped get things back to normal. If that doesn't help, try to change the resolution manually back and forth. If you use proprietary drivers look for position and multi screen options in the corresponding applications.\n", "Q: Chrome Ash full screen With \"google-chrome --open-ash\" chrome starts in ash mode, but how to create launcher to start in fullscreen (not kiosk mode but the same as F11)?\n\nA: I have an old Asus 1000HE Eee PC (32-bit, 2GB RAM, 128GB SSD). Fedora 21 with Gnome Shell runs ok, but as I only use this netbook to browse the web, I figured I’d try to figure out how to launch Chrome as the desktop environment, cutting Gnome Shell out completely.  In the process of trying to determine which lightweight window manager I would use, I discovered that Google Chrome (my browser of choice) includes it’s own called Ash. So, setting this up was as easy as creating a single file, and simply selecting “Chrome” as my login session from GDM.\n/etc/X11/sessions/chrome.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Chrome\nComment=Chrome Browser\nExec=/usr/bin/google-chrome --open-ash --ash-force-desktop --ash-host-window-bounds=\"1024x600\"\nTryExec=/usr/bin/google-chrome\nIcon=\nType=Application\nDesktopNames=Chrome\n\nThis isn’t a perfect solution, but it’s pretty neat. A few problems:\nTriggering a download crashes the browser, as Chrome can’t launch the Gnome (GTK?) download widget.\nNo battery, audio, or wifi system icons.\nInitially, the desktop was off-center.  Apparently, the netbook screen size (1024×600) was odd, so it needed to be explicitly specified with the “-bounds” parameter.\n\nCopied verbatim from the web ...\n", "Q: Keyboard not working on Ubuntu 14.10 Live CD My system is Lenovo Idea-pad Notebook running Windows 7 Ultimate. I want to switch over to Ubuntu 14.10 and tried it with Ubuntu LiveCD. On the Try Ubuntu mode the keyboard is not working. What can I do?\n\nA: According to my research this issue is resolved through a BIOS upgrade (direct link to file). Unfortunately many people seem to have issues to run this update even with the recommended Windows 7, but this can be resolved by placing an older AMI flashing driver amifldrv32.sys in the same folder (source).

I have a basic idea of how it was but I can't get the nitty gritty down, like the Whisker menu.\n\nA: If you are using a Xubuntu 15.10 and later, open XFCE Panel Switch either from Settings Manager or the Whisker Menu (located under Settings).\n\nYou will find various configurations for the Xubuntu panels layout. You can select any of the options presented there and apply it by pressing the gears button. You can also save your current configuration for future use.\n\nA: You can reset the panel by running the command xfce4-panel --quit ; pkill xfconfd ; rm -rf ~/.config/xfce4/panel ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-panel.xml ; xfce4-panel; (Source)\nIf this doesn't reset the Whisker Menu you could then try sudo apt-get purge xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin and then sudo apt-get install xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin (Source for package name)\n\nA: Right click on your panel > Panel Preferences. Then hit the red minus icon to delete it. Then just add your new panel, and from there you can add in the Whisker Menu and whatever else you might want, including custom ordering as well as custom icons etc. You can also make a spacer transparent and set it to expand (to right align items). Attached is my center screen panel. For Whisker Menu, I added my own icon, and I set a slight transparency to it. Pretty awesome customization possible with xfce.\nI have never worried with taking a panel back to its 'original' state. I think it is most ideal to just add the items you want. \n\nA: see: https://askubuntu.com/a/1205840/1093368\n\nThe defaults for the panel is stored in /etc/xdg/xfce4/panel/default.xml.

You probably migrated your .gnupg folder from another machine, or tampered another way with the file permissions.\nThese two lines fix the permissions.

For now, you should continue to use Java 8 because Oracle Java 9 is available as an early access release (it should be released in 2016)!\n", "Q: Archive manager which has integration into Nemo except File Roller (Archive Manager)? I mean something like \"Extract Here\" and \"Compress...\" menus on right-click. \n\nA: Actually, Nemo can be integrated with the default archive manager shipped with Unity. Webup8 provides Nemo with a series of extensions that integrates it tightly with Unity. The steps are:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/nemo\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nemo nemo-fileroller\nsudo apt-get install nemo-compare nemo-dropbox nemo-media-columns nemo-pastebin nemo-seahorse nemo-share nemo-emblems nemo-image-converter nemo-rabbitvcs\n\nAfter this, among many other improvements, you should have the \"Extract Here\" and \"Compress...\" options in the context menu.\n", "Q: CRON doesn't run tasks because \"/bin/bash: /var/log/cron.log: Permission denied\" I have the following CRON task:\nMAILTO=\"my@email.com\"\n\n# Begin Whenever generated tasks for: projectname\n30 4 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/deployer/apps/project_production/releases/20150305135322 && bin/rails runner -e production '\\''Invoices.run_update'\\'' >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1'\n\n# End Whenever generated tasks for: projectname\n\nBut when I take a look on the report that is sent to my email address from the server, there's just following:\n/bin/bash: /var/log/cron.log: Permission denied\n\n(the path to the log file is proper)\nWhich permissions do I have to set for log files of CRON jobs?\nThank you, have a nice day.\nEDIT:\nthere is no cron.allow or cron.deny file in the /etc directory.\nEDIT2;\nTried sudo chmod u+w cron.log, but still the same.\n\nA: Looks like it can't create the log file.

I'm new to Linux so apologize in advance for the basic question.  I have two drives installed in this machine.  It is essentially poor man's RAID - the second drive is a copy of the first.  There is a very small app and database that is a folder called /home/xxx.  I want to copy the contents of this folder from the first drive to the second drive on a schedule say once an hour.\nIn Windows, I would use something like SyncToy to do this and it would be very easy to setup.  I'm assuming I can do this easily in Ubuntu as well.\nThis machine recently failed and having the backup disk really saved our butts.  However, I didn't set up the backup.  I think it just used the built-in backup software but I have no idea how to tell it to copy to a different drive.\nThanks!\n\nA: Set up a script (like a BAT file in Windows) that issues an rsync command. The rsync command will synchronize disk 2 with disk 1 (and not the other way around). Make this script executable (with the chmod command) and test it. Open your cron file (crontab -e) and schedule your rsync script to run at every hour.\nYou could put the rsync command in the cron file directly, but I prefer to have cron call a script so you can easily add more commands if necessary.\n", "Q: apt-get update 404 on trusty Does anyone know why these are 404ing?

My Sony Vaio runs Windows 8.1 and I wish to dual boot Ubuntu 14.10 on it.\nHere's how I installed Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable secure boot and fast startup.\n\n*Boot from USB and install.\n\n*I selected 'install beside windows 8.1' and did not select 'something else'\nAfter the installation the laptop rebooted, since my USB was still plugged in, it booted into it and realized I made a mistake. I powered off the laptop, pulled the USB stick out and then turned it on. It booted straight to Windows 8.1.\nMy boot order was CD > External > Internal. Network boot is disabled.\nHere are some of the things I tried after looking at similar questions on this site:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried the following commands bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi , bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi, with secure boot enabled and disabled accordingly but still no sight of grub.\n\n*I then shift clicked restart > selected use a device in the menu that came afterwards > and selected ubuntu from there and the laptop rebooted. But unlike the other questions I've seen on this site, once again Ubuntu did not load and instead windows booted up. This method works for this individual.\n\n*Afterwards I tried the boot-repair after booting into the live CD but that did not work either. Here is the file that was generated from the boot-repair tool :(http://paste.ubuntu.com/10551408/).\nA very similar question that I don't understand the solution to:\nThis question on AskUbuntu seems similar to mine except he manages to get the grub menu showing using his little hack, but that does not work for me (mine boots right into Windows).\nAlso, I do not understand how to carry out the most voted answer to that question. \nMore details about my laptop:\nIt's a Sony Vaio E14P: SVE14A290X with a 240 gig Intel SSD, added by myself. I noted that other Sony laptops (different models) had issues with SSD's but all of them managed to load the grub menu without a problem.\nEDIT:\nSomething else I found when following this tutorial: \nTo set GRUB2 as the default bootloader follow these steps:\n\nLogin to Windows 8\nGo to the desktop\nRight click on the start button and choose administrator command prompt\nType mountvol g: /s (This maps your EFI folder structure to the G drive). \nType cd g:\\EFI\nWhen you do a directory listing you will see a folder for Ubuntu. Type dir.\nThere should be options for grubx64.efi and shimx64.efi\nRun the following command to set grubx64.efi as the bootloader:\n\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nReboot your computer\nYou should now have a GRUB menu appear with options for Ubuntu and Windows.\nIf your computer still boots straight to Windows repeat steps 1 through 7 again but this time type:\n\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nReboot your computer\n\nWhen I type dir, to check the directory contents, instead of a folder called Ubuntu I get a huge list of windows related files. Does this mean my ubuntu is not installed in the correct place?\nFINAL UPDATE:\nAfter trying so hard for so many days, running codes and messing with things I didn't know, I tried installing EasyBCD (something I missed out on somehow) and using that I deleted the Sony boot loader entry, the Windows 8.1 boot loader entry and just left Windows 8.1 and ubuntu and rebooted, and guess what? Grub loaded up!! Windows works fine too. I followed this tutorial. Thanks everyone who tried to help me!

I've seen many problem reports similar to yours, but I don't own a Sony, so I'm unable to experiment hands-on and figure out the best workaround. If this is a new computer, I'd seriously consider returning it because of these problems. If you do, write a letter to Sony telling them why you returned the machine. Companies are like dogs; they'll deliver an unpleasant brown substance unless they're swatted on the nose when they do! For a company, a \"swat on the nose\" is accomplished by returning a product.\nIf you decide to keep the computer, try using a rEFInd USB flash drive or CD-R to boot. If you can get rEFInd to boot, it should give you options to boot either Windows or Ubuntu. This will at least enable you to get into a more comfortable Ubuntu environment than the emergency disk you're presumably using to run Boot Repair. You can then read up on how EFI loaders work, experiment with efibootmgr and renaming various files, and maybe find a solution.\nAnother option is to completely delete everything on the computer and re-install it from scratch. I've heard that Microsoft has recently made legal Windows 8 installation media available for download. Re-installing Windows using a stock disk set will have the advantage that you won't have OEM-specific bloatware or OEM-provided security compromises like Superfish. Such a setup, being \"plain-vanilla\" rather than \"super-duper ehanced with weird stuff,\" should be easier to manage. Note that for this to do any good, you'd need a stock Microsoft installer, not something provided by Sony.\n\nA: I had a very similar issue and had it resolved last night. Try this and see if it works.\nIf you don't see any boot leader and Ubuntu starts directly then you have to edit your grub file. Follow these steps. Press Crtl+Alt+T to open Terminal or search Terminal from dash.\nThen enter following command:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub \n\nChange values as below wherever necessary:\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false \n\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\n\nThen save the file (Crtl+S) and run following command in terminal.\n  sudo update-grub\n\nReboot your system\n", "Q: Changing Background Image in Multiple Terminals I was wondering if anyone would know how to change the background image in the terminal in a unique way.\nI know how to change it so that every instance of the terminal has the same background, but I occasionally end up using 2 or 3 terminals to work in different paths.\nI was wondering if there is a way to set some like\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal 1: Image 1\n\n*Terminal 2: Image 2\n\n*Terminal 3: Image 3\n\n*...\n\n*Terminal N: Image N\n\n\nEDIT\nI was hoping to do this by developing a technique that would look through an assortment of profiles, previously defined by me, and each time I opened a terminal it would cycle through the next profile until it reaches the end and then it restarts. I am not sure what the best approach would be to this. Maybe an addition to ~/.bash_aliases that defines the profiles and sets the terminal to change depending on the amount of times a terminal has been opened in that session.\n\nA: What will you need ? xdotool (sudo apt-get install xdotool) and couple different profiles. I have 8 different profiles in my gnome-terminal , all with different colors or background settings. Make sure you have the menu bar (File, Edit, etc.) enabled. Otherwise - won't work\nThe command\nxdotool key alt+f b $( expr $RANDOM % 8 )\nExplanation: we get a random number $RANDOM as generated by the shell, get it's modulus (remainder) out of division by maximum number of profiles you have, and let xdotool execute sequence of keyboard shortcuts that correspond to dropping down File (alt+f) menu, selecting open new tab (b), and selecting profile with corresponding number\nYou can turn this command into an alias (alias newtab='xdotool key alt+f b $( expr $RANDOM % 8 )') or script\nI've taken that very same alias and placed it into my .mkshrc file (because I use mksh, not bash, so for you it's .bashrc). Here it is in action\n\nUpdate | April 22, 2015\nHere's a script to open a terminal window with your desired profile (and for each profile you can specify your own colors and background picture). Bind it to a keyboard shortcut through System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom. \nFor the command add full path to script\n\n\nThe script\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPROFILE=$(zenity --entry --text=\"Enter Profile Name\")\ngnome-terminal --window-with-profile=\"$PROFILE\" &\n\n", "Q: I don't know the passphrase to ubuntu.

To any ZFS developers reading this, the operation of replacing a disc should be made much easier/full (and fool) proof.  After the initial setup and on a long enough time line the only operation every ZFS user will eventually have to do is replace a disc.  But I digress.\nIn my case I didn't want to replace my drive, I only wanted to clear its faults and get it back online fault free so I could determine if the disc actually needed to be replaced.  My reasoning for wanting to do this was 1.) the system had been on for nearly a year without a reboot so bit rot is a possibility 2.) the number of errors was fairly small.\nThe trick it seemed for me was to delete the partitions from the disc in question.  First I needed to determine which device to operate on.  You could determine this via process of elimination using zdb, but I used lshw to get all the info I needed at once.  Basically I wanted to correlate the the device zpool status was telling me had failed to a /dev/sdX device (if you are not familiar with less just use the up/down keys to show more/less and the q key to quit).\nroot@server:/# lshw|less\n...\n              *-disk:2\n                   description: ATA Disk\n                   product: ST3000DM001-1CH1\n                   vendor: Seagate\n                   physical id: 0.2.0\n                   bus info: scsi@0:0.2.0\n                   logical name: /dev/sdd\n                   version: CC24\n                   serial: Z1F1J33Y\n                   size: 2794GiB (3TB)\n                   capacity: 2794GiB (3TB)\n                   capabilities: 15000rpm gpt-1.00 partitioned partitioned:gpt\n                   configuration: ansiversion=6 guid=52d25a12-120a-1c40-92a1-0be436c2d642 sectorsize=4096\n                 *-volume:0\n                      description: OS X ZFS partition or Solaris /usr partition\n                      vendor: Solaris\n                      physical id: 1\n                      bus info: scsi@0:0.2.0,1\n                      logical name: /dev/sdd1\n                      serial: f25724a4-dd55-764c-af34-9479521854b9\n                      capacity: 2794GiB\n                      configuration: name=zfs\n                 *-volume:1\n                      description: reserved partition\n                      vendor: Solaris\n                      physical id: 9\n                      bus info: scsi@0:0.2.0,9\n                      logical name: /dev/sdd9\n                      serial: 89eeeedb-e3a0-4940-8a50-d3d7506ad603\n                      capacity: 8191KiB\n...\n\nHere I can see that /dev/sdd is the disc I wanted.  I then deleted the partitions from that disc:\nroot@server:/# fdisk -l /dev/sdd\n\nThen just follow the onscreen prompts for deleting the partition.  Here is a good guide.  After that the following command finally worked:\nroot@server:/# zpool replace tank 12956315685006632708 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3000DM001-1CH166_Z1F1J33Y\n\nThe guid (that long number) was obtained using the zdb command.  I think in the end I might have been able to use the online command instead of replace, but I didn't try that.\n", "Q: Terminal or Konsole? I am using Ubuntu 14.10 with KDE graphical environment.

I have forgotten the password that I used while installing postgres. It asks for the password for every action I perform.

And even after updating your $PATH variable in your .bashrc file, you still find that NetBeans will not launch, and when you try and launch it through command-line with the command:\n./netbeans-8.0.2/bin/netbeans\n\nIs just gives you:\nCannot find java. Please use the --jdkhome switch.\n\nBut then when you try to specify the new jdkhome with (<version will be replaced with your version number, for example it could be replaced with 1.8.0_40):\n./netbeans-8.0.2/bin/netbeans --jdkhome jdk<version>/\n\nYou find that you have to do that each time for NetBeans to actually launch, and it is becoming rather a nuisance.\nSo what you actually need to do is to go to the NetBeans config file where the actual JDK home variable is set for NetBeans so that NetBeans can refer to that when starting up.\n\nA: To find the variable which sets the JDK home for Netbeans you need to open the config file which sets it (replace <versionNumber> with the version number of your NetBeans, such as 8.0.2 and make sure that you are in the directory which the NetBeans folder is in, this will most likely either be your home directory (to cd to that do: cd ~), or /usr/local/ (to cd to that do: cd /usr/local/)):\ngedit netbeans-<versionNumber>/etc/netbeans.conf\n\nAnd then locate variable called netbeans_jdkhome and set it to the current location of your JDK folder. For example it could look something like this (<username> replaced with your username):\nnetbeans_jdkhome=\"/home/<username>/jdk1.8.0_40\"\n\nThen save your changes to the config file, and NetBeans should launch with no problem.\n", "Q: how to disable keyring prompt when you don't know the current /old password I am trying to disable the keyring prompt on my ubuntu 14.04 LTS laptop. I'm trying to add a new wifi hotspot and it keeps prompting me for the keyring password.\nI've read various posts here about how to do it including: \n1.  remove it as a start up application\n2.  go into \"passwords and keys\" and try to change the login settings.  \nThe problem with the first option is that when I go into start up applications, I only have one item called: \"Indicator Application\".  I don't see anything else there that I can disable. \nWhen I go into passwords and keys, in order to reset the password, you need to know the old / current keyring password, which I don't know. I don't ever recall setting up a keyring password.  I think I need to do more reading on what it is and how it's set up... which i'm in the process of doing.  But I thought I'd also post a question.  \nI have one account set up on this machine, and a boot password.\nI tried both of them to unlock the key ring, but neither worked. \nAny suggestions would be appreciated - even if it's just pointing me to the right article to read.\nThanks.\n\nA: If you want to delete the keyrings\nrm ~/.local/share/keyrings -fr\n\nThe next time it is needed a new one will be generated and you will be prompted for a new password.

I'm very newbie, please don't annoy for my question.\nI've installed LaTeX using apt-get install texlive-full but really don't know where it has been installed. As from Atom's LaTeX package needs TeX distribution's bin directory, so I tried to find it, but I could only find /etc/texmf/ and /usr/local/share/texmf which not seem to be what I want. \nSo, I would like to ask if what should I do to be able to use LaTeX package in Atom and should I create a PATH for Texlive? \nSorry for weird question and thank you in advance.\n\nA: As far as I can tell, the issue is not one of setting your TeX distribution's binary directory (which, unless you have installed it to a non-standard location, should be /usr/bin anyway). Rather, it is because the Atom LaTeX package requires latexmk, which is not part of the texlive distribution.\nSo the solution appears to be to install the latexmk package, either using Software Center or from the terminal using sudo apt install latexmk. You should be able to leave the Atom LaTex package's Tex Path setting empty.\n", "Q: Sort Unity Launcher icons alphabetically I like to keep my locked Launcher applications sorted alphabetically, and I was wondering if it would be possible to write a script that sorts them, so I don't have to do it myself every time I add a new program. \nIf there is a folder somewhere that contains all the names and locations of the icons I should be able to figure it out from there.\n\nA: You can get them using\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\n\nand set them with\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites VALUE\n\nwhere VALUE has the same format as what you've gotten from gsettings get ...\n\nA: Keep the launcher sorted alphabetically\nRunning the script below in the background (see further below how to do that) will keep your launcher sorted alphabetically from a to z:\nThe top three launcher items before running the script: Gnome-terminal, Virtualbox, LibreOffice\n\nRunning the script: dconf-editor, Files, Firefox\n\nWhat the script does\nThe (interface-) names of the applications is defined in .desktop files.

It seems Ubuntu from 13 has much 3d grahics that don't work well with onboard GPU. Since my pc was a business pc and lacked fancy high performance hardware I was advices by ubuntu to use lubuntu and I must confess lubuntu is super light fast on my system. It's very much the same as ubuntu but only better. Doing that saved me lots of time in trying to solve my hardware issues that I don't have time for since time is money. You can just install lxde in your current ubuntu and it will have a lubuntu choice at the log in screen. You'll need something like 1GB free space for that to install. As for me I cleaned installed lubuntu since I didn't have much complicated files that need advanced backup bacuse I just had documents. Good luck with wonderful and free ubuntu. Saves me alot of cash.\n", "Q: why does not IPv6 (RFC 4941) privacy work? I've followed instructions on https://docs.menandmice.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=6361024\nIt simply does not work, I have no Ipv6 starting with  2001::: , only the same as before.\n\nandre@Loke:~$ sudo sysctl -a | grep tempaddr\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.use_tempaddr = 2\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.use_tempaddr = 2\nnet.ipv6.conf.eth0.use_tempaddr = 2\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.use_tempaddr = -1\nnet.ipv6.conf.vmnet1.use_tempaddr = 2\nnet.ipv6.conf.vmnet8.use_tempaddr = 2\nandre@Loke:~$ sudo sysctl -p\nnet.ipv6.conf.eth0.use_tempaddr = 2\nandre@Loke:~$ \n\n\nA: With IPv6 privacy extensions, you don't magically get an address starting with 2001::. Instead, the starting of the IPv6 address will be the what you get from your ISP.\nYou'll still use the prefix of the IPv6 address that's been assigned to you. However, the suffix (the 2nd part) will be randomly generated, instead of being based on your MAC address.\nIf you run ip -6 addr, you should see that there are several non-fe80:: addresses for your main interface. These addresses should have the same global prefix (typically, the first four parts of the address). If so, this means that IPv6 privacy extensions are working.  \nYou can also identify by looking at the end of each IPv6 address printed with ip -6 addr. Any link local IPv6 address line ends with a suffix of scope link, each global static ends with suffix scope global static, each from SLAAC ends with suffix scope global dynamic, each private extension address ends with suffix scope global temporary dynamic and expired with scope global temporary deprecated.\nAlso, note that the 2001:db8/32 has been designated for use in documentation only.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Lubuntu?

I am running Ubuntu 14.04 along with Windows 7. The problem is that when I first installed Ubuntu I didn't really expect it to become my main operating system so I gave it small partitions naively thinking that if I ever needed more space it would just take more automatically. Now I am faced with this issue, I have over 250 gb of free space but it is not anywhere near my root partition. \nI tried live booting from a usb and turning off swap which allowed me to make the partition of /dev/sda4 bigger but, I could not figure out how to make the root or the home any bigger. I am guessing because it was not directly in line with the new open spots. As most of you can probably tell I am using gparted to make all of the partitions move. If it makes any different I had a lot of issue's with raid setups back when I started but those are all fixed, namely I just don't use my ssd with ubuntu, because of these issue's though I had to create my own partitions in the beginning. \n\nA: You have to do this in steps.\nFirst add the unallocated space to the extneded partition, sda4 -> apply changes\nNext you have to move your partitions one at a time until the unallocated space is adjacent to your / partition. You have to do it is steps -> move a partition, apply changes ... move a partition -> apply changes\n", "Q: Cannot connect to wi-fi network in Lubuntu 14.04 I messed up while trying to uninstall unnecessary packages and ended up breaking my ability to connect to a wi-fi network on my Lubuntu box. What I do see is icons for my network interfaces; clicking on the one for wlan0 lists the ssids and lets me enter the encryption key, but no connection is established after.\nWhat needs to be installed for this to be working once again?\n\nA: It seems I fell victim to multiple techniques of network configuration conflicting with one another. In my /etc/network/interfaces config file, I had entries for my network interfaces, and the UI in Ubuntu uses the network-manager suite of tools. After removing all my devices (except for loopback) from /etc/network/interfaces, I was able to use network manager utilities to establish my connection. This also resolved the issue of my boot process taking a long time waiting for network configuration.\n", "Q: How do I set up two monitors on two very different graphics cards? I have two video cards, one running each of two identical monitors. My main card is an Nvidia GeForce 750 Ti, and the secondary is a Radeon HD5500. When I boot from live USB, the monitor attached to the HD5500 displays the desktop, and the other displays a gray screen with a flashing cursor (but doesn't do anything else). After installing, the desktop shows up on the GeForce, and the Radeon monitor is blank. \nI followed this guide to attempt to install proprietary Nvidia drivers, but it didn't work. So I tried downloading the package straight from Nvidia. I think that worked, but I'm not sure (I'm completely new to this). I then tried to select a different driver for the Radeon from the list on the Additional Drivers settings tab. Now when I boot Ubuntu, the Radeon monitor gets no signal, and the GeForce monitor displays black. \nWhat did I do wrong, and how do I fix it?\nUbuntu 14.04 dual boot with Windows 8.1 U1\n\nA: You didn't do anything wrong.  What you're trying to do is \"impossible\".  Both graphics cards have their own discrete memory and you need a shared frame buffer between the two to make this work...\nThe BumbleBee project is doing this for Intel and NVidia cards, but they don't support AMD/ATI cards, so unless you start programming this yourself for AMD, it's \"impossible\"...

I don't have admin access to the site, just the address. If I try to save it and open it from the .html file, it looks completely different from the actual site, I suppose my first question is: why is that? Mainly, I'm trying to find a way to make changes to the site and preview said changes in a convenient manner possibly using Filezilla. I don't have a web host, though I know there are ones that are free but for the purposes of previewing the site in the way it appears in the browser, is that even necessary? \n\nA: To view a local html page exactly like it looks on the web server, you would need to download not just the html file but all associated components, like .css files, .js scripts, webfont files, etc, and even then it is possible for a web page to change its outlook in real time. This is possible to do in a browser. \nAlso keep in mind that by the time the html file arrives in your computer, all server-side processing has been applied, so what is stored in the server may differ significantly from what you see.\nIf you use Chrome or Firefox, saving a web page as \"Webpage (complete)\" will store the html page as a single file and additionally create a folder, in the same location and with the same name, with as many associated files as it can find. The browser will also modify the links in the html page to point to the local files, rather than the files on the server. But even then, the page may be too complex to render exactly like the web page.\n", "Q: After installing ubuntu facing issues while starting windows8.1 I have successfully installed Ubuntu14.04.2 on my laptop (LENOVO B50-70) alongside windows 8.1 which was pre-installed.

All worked very well. (Ubuntu 11, Ubuntu 14, EduBoss, Redhat6, Nodezero, Windows 8, Win 7). I frequently used Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14 last 6-7 months, I enjoy all operating system but one day after CHKDSK perform by Win7 my PC was unable to start with windows boot. If I try to start windows PC restarts very fast and shows nothing to any options just restart.\nAll other Linux O.S.  work but no any other Win boot is working.\nAs per my knowledge I guesses that problem occurred by file corruption or by CHKDSK operation by Windows.    \nCan I repair Windows boot option by Linux? (without win bootable disk) \n\n\n*\n\n*Architect i386\n\n*2 Gb ram \n\n*Intel quad core\n\n*OS. First I installed windows and then Linux. \n\n\nA: One of the methods using Linux is to use fsck.msdos command which is found majorly in most of the Linux Distributions. While you've not mentioned that is there any error shown by Windows and, it is not mentioned too whether it is possible to boot into Safe Mode by pressing and holding Shift and tapping F8 repeatedly. Based on the dearth of information here, I advise booting into Linux, open the Terminal, and type:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo fsck.msdos /dev/XYZ where XYZ is the partition where Windows is installed(say sda1).\n\nThere are many parameters available which can be accessed by typing fsck.msdos -h but the basic command should be able to correct your Windows.\n\nIf that went well, you will want to check whether Linux is able to detect Windows loader now or not. Besides, you need to generate a new GRUB configuration file too. I'm assuming the Linux you're booted into is running Grub 2.0. To Probe the Boot Loader, type the command:\n\n*\n\n*sudo os-probe, it shall give you an output like this:\n\n\n/dev/sda1:Windows 7 (loader):Windows:chain\n\nIf you receive any such output, you can go ahead for building new Grub configuration file. In Terminal, type:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg, if your grub.cfg is at some other location then replace the path in the command with your file location.\n\n*Type sudo grub-install /dev/sda where sda is my primary HDD having Windows and Linux installed.\n\n\nReboot, and choose Windows in Grub Menu. it should boot. If it doesn't we can try other methods but your question demands only Linux-specific solution.\n\nA: Have you try Boot-Repair tool? It seems that your boot files were messed up by CHKDSK.\n\nA: 1> use win7 disk\n2> start up repair \n3> chkdsk >>>> restart \nafter restart win boot louder start but GRUB not.\nto fix that USE \"BOOT-repair\" disk and \"fsck.msdos\" commands. both answers are very helpful together.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Wireless is fluctuating I'm trying use my internet and I've been connected with a cord for a month now.

Sorry for all the questions I am just really and new to the whole spectrum of of this kind of os.\n\nA: The main difference is where you're booting from - the computer hard drive or USB drive. There is something called a persistence file you can create when you create the bootable USB drive if there is enough space left over.  Things you save to your persistence file should be available no matter which PC you boot it from.  That being said you could also save files to whichever HDD (hard drive disk) is present in the computer you are booting from.  Those would be local to the PC.

I don't want a screen saver, I want a gorgeous changing graphic to replace my screen image when my computers are on but not being directly used (Electric sheep was amazing). This includes my desk laptop, my lounge multimedia machine driving a huge monitor, my workbench computer and my travelling laptop\nIt seems no one anywhere has electricsheep running on 14.04 LTS. \nHow do I run it?\nthanks\n\nA: According to the electric sheep Linux Client Instructions, the ichthyo/zeug PPA can be used (on Ubuntu 14.04, 15.04, 15.10, and 16.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Run the following:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ichthyo/zeug\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install electricsheep\n\n\nA: It's on Github now. To compile, you'll need wxwidget 3.0 dev and Flam3, as mentioned here:\n\nIf you have Ubuntu 10.04 or Debian Sid, then you can just use the\n  package manager or type sudo apt-get install electricsheep, although\n  that will get you an old version, it should work fine.\nOtherwise, the preferred way to install it is from source.\nsudo apt-get install subversion autoconf libtool libgtk2.0-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev\n\nliblua5.1-0-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev libjpeg8-dev\n  libgtop2-dev libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev\n  libtinyxml-dev freeglut3-dev glee-dev\nInstall wxWidgets 3.0.\ninstall from source flam3 (./configure; make; sudo make install),\n  and then checkout client source and then ./autogen.sh; ./configure;\n  make; sudo make install.\nIt should configure itself to be your screensaver, but you can also\n  run it from the command line just by typing electricsheep. You can\n  also use electricsheep-preferences to configure it.\n\nI have it running on my end, just trying to figure out how to make it a screensaver.\n\nA: I'm guessing you mean this Electric Sheep?\nWell the theoretical steps would be\n\n\n*\n\n*Satisfy dependancies. Install in the following order: libsvga1 (32-bit, 64-bit), esound-common (32-bit, 64-bit), libaudiofile1(32-bit, 64-bit), libesd0 (32-bit, 64-bit), mplayer (32-bit, 64-bit), flam3 (32-bit, 64-bit) etc... for every other package the Ubuntu Software says it needs and that the packages it needs, needs and so on\n\n*Install Electric Sheep (32-bit, 64-bit)\nHowever, I installed all the packages above but don't want to go any further because I'm worried that packages will start to conflict and I'll end up with a broken system. There's probably a reason why simply installing it and installing the dependencies through APT doesn't work.\nIndeed, they rejected it for inclusion in the 14.04 repositories because it's 'orphaned, RC-buggy, [has] licence problems'.\nSadly, if you really want Electric Sheep, because it seems quite old you'll have to run it on Ubuntu 12.04 (which is supported for another two years). Ubuntu 14.04 just doesn't have the (presumably legacy) packages that Electric Sheep needs.\n", "Q: Download stuff under URL path Suppose I have certain pages, e.g. www.abc.def/ghi/a.html; how can I download\nall the pages under www.abc.def/ghi using httrack?

This might be a simple Ubuntu question (well I am new to Linux) but I do not understand how I can get Ubuntu to see the new pandoc version. \n\nA: Cabal not affect the archive of ubuntu packages. You need to move generated binary to desired path for execution, and uninstall manually the system package.\n\nA: Pandoc is written in the Haskell programming language. Cabal is a sort of package manager for Haskell programs. If you install anything with Cabal, the binaries end up in $HOME/cabal/bin/.\nHowever, very likely your PATH environment variable is not pointing to that directory, or not pointing at it before other directories.\nYou should try the following in a terminal:\nPATH=$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH\n\npandoc --version\n\nThis should work.

Help \nNetbook (Acer a0531h) \nThanks \n\nA: You will need to download your preferred version of Lubuntu (I recommend the LTS version) and then create a boot usb with the downloaded image file.\nOnce you have created the boot usb insert it into your laptop and boot it up. Different laptops use different keybindings but look for a setting that says something like \"select boot device\" and press (and hold) the corresponding key during the boot-up process.

(do not burn it on CD/DVD if your PC came with Windows8)\n(2) Insert the Boot-Repair-Disk and reboot the PC,\n(3) Choose your language,\n(4) Connect internet if possible\n(5) Click \"Recommended repair\"\n(6) Reboot the pc --> solves the majority of bootsector/GRUB/MBR problems\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu on Inspiron 14R I have a Dell Inspiron 14R laptop, and I have tried almost everything to install Ubuntu.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Bootable USB drive \n\n*PLOP  \n\n*Regular installation \n\n\nI'm currently on Windows 8.1.\nI want to install Ubuntu on my laptop and remove Windows 8 completely.\nMy problem is that I never got to the Ubuntu installation screen. I always failed to boot from the USB drive. When I use the special restart the only option available is the Windows 8 \"Startup Settings\".\n\n\n\n\nA: A less radical fix\nMost computers enable you to enter the firmware setup utility, or at least get a boot manager menu, by hitting a function key (or sometimes Esc, Del, or something else) in the first few seconds after you power on the machine. Unfortunately, there's no standardization in what key does what, so if you don't see a prompt, you may have to just try all the function keys, Esc, and Del until something works. The timing can be tricky, too. I generally start hitting the desired key 2-3 times a second as soon as I power the computer on.\nIf you get a boot menu, it should have options for launching your USB drive. Pick the option that includes \"UEFI\" in the description, if there are two entries.\nIf you get into the firmware setup utility, look for options to disable \"fast start,\" enable USB ports, or something similar. (\"Fast start\" in the firmware causes it to do little or no initialization of USB devices, among other things, which speeds the boot process but prevents booting from external media.) You may also be able to adjust the boot order to boot from a USB device first, but that device may need to be plugged in for the option to be available.\nA more radical fix\nIf you can't get a boot menu or the setup utility, you could try using a partitioning tool to delete all the partitions on the disk. With no partitions present, the firmware will either enter its own setup utility, which should enable you to adjust the boot order, or boot to whatever external medium has a valid boot loader.\nBe sure to get all the partitions, though. The Windows boot loader is stored on the EFI System Partition (ESP), so if you leave it intact, the firmware will think everything's just fine and boot to the Windows boot loader, which will then fail, leaving you in a worse state than you're in now. A few partitioning tools, like OS X's Disk Utility, intentionally hide the ESP from view, so there is a risk of missing it with some tools. I'm pretty sure that the standard Windows tool does show the ESP. If you want to be 100% sure of getting it, you could use my GPT fdisk (gdisk), which is available in Windows form.\nYou'll be unable to restore the system to a factory default settings if you do this. A compromise might be to delete the ESP but leave everything else intact. This should still enable you to boot an external disk and use it to back up the remaining partitions. (In fact, you could even back up the ESP by recovering it with TestDisk or the like, once you've booted your external medium.)\nOf course, the big risk here is that if you try this approach and it doesn't work, you'll have no way to use the computer. If it's new, though, I'd return it to the store at that point because if the firmware doesn't enable you to boot from an external medium when there's no OS on the built-in disk, it's badly broken by design and deserves to be returned.\n", "Q: Persistent Live usb vs Full install I have looked at some of the other forum post and they don't answer my question.\nI have been using various Linux Live CDs for some time now, but I've just bought a 16Gb usb 3 stick for a Linux (Ubuntu) install and I wanted some advice\nI wanted to know wether I'm better of with a Persistent Live usb or a Full install \nIn an ideal world I would like all the features of a full install but portability will be important for me, I will be using it on two very different machines and will want to use it on friends and family's laptops for repairs.

I have been attempting to use Gimp but usually have to quit frustrated. Using Gimp tutorials do not help because the steps include opening up options I simply don't have. \nFor example, trying to align text. The tutorial tells me to click Align in the toolbox and another box is supposed to appear with the title Toolbox Options. that dialog box never appears. Tutorials using the toolbox are useless, because what is shown is not what happens. \nIs there a tutorial that shows how to use Gimp without the toolbox? \n\nA: Gimp has a feature to run in single window mode, or to run in classic mode where tools and docks are displayed as their own window. To toggle between these modes we tick or untick Windows > Single-Windws-Mode from the global menu top bar.\nSingle Window Mode\n\nClassic Windowed Mode\n\n\nIn windowed mode we can close all windows. They will then disappear and will no longer be available until we re-open them. These windows also will not re-appear on just toggling to Single-Window-Mode.\n\n\nTo get back your toolbox do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Toggle to windowed mode (untick Windows - Single Window Mode)\n\n*Open the toolbox (Windows > Tool Box Ctrl + B)\n\n*Open additional docks you need (e.g. Windows > Dockable Dialogs > Tool Options)\n\n*Toogle back to Single - Window - Mode.\n\nTo restore all windows to defaults see: How to restore the default toolbox windows in GIMP?\n\nA: The questions mentions an Align tool. It seems like the tool options for this tool are not docked anywhere in the GIMP UI.\nThis is what we are looking for:\n\nIf this docked dialog is missing, it is easy to get it back by following this menu path: Windows → Dockable Windows → Tool Options\nPutting it back below the toolbox - its default place - or anywhere else is done by docking it where you want it, this is described in the GIMP user manual in the Dialogs and Docking section (many people apparently don't get that they have to drag the dialog content and not the dialog window).\n", "Q: Suspicious traffic shows on nethogs but not netstat Recently I noticed my little Banana Pi Server running Ubuntu 14.04.2 a bit laggy, so I checked several stuff.

I assume your /dev/sda1 is an existing partition with data on it as you would not use 7GB on a fresh install, and /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6 have not been formatted yet.\nHere is what I would do to move forward and have data you don't want to lose on /dev/sda1.\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop the installation process\n\n*Start gparted (a GUI partition editor) and delete /dev/sda5 (the swap partition)\n\n*Using gparted, expand /dev/sda1 to the max it will allow you\n\n*If you have data on /dev/sda6 (once again, I think it is not formatted yet based on the screenshot): open Files to get access to it, and copy data over to /dev/sda1 using the Files tool\n\n*If you run out of space on /dev/sda1, you can start gparted to shrink /dev/sda6 and grow /dev/sda1 as files get copied over\n\n*using Files, create a new folder in the /dev/sda1 partition, and move everything in there\n\n*when you are done, start gparted and delete /dev/sda6\n\n*after /dev/sda6 is deleted, grow /dev/sda1 to the size you want (I'd say 18G will do in this case) using gparted once more\n\n*close gparted, restart the installation, and do a full install using /dev/sda1 as /\n\n*during the installation process you can create your swap partition, which will now become /dev/sda2\n\n\nAfter installing and first boot, you can move the files you wanted to keep from the folder you create to your home directory.

Also, it occasionally appeared to have trouble resolving DNS.\nThen, I connected the system in question directly to another host and assigned static IPs. Surprisingly, I got 100% success over 1,000+ pings. My next step was to bypass local router and switch and to connect Xubuntu system directly to the internet. Again, between 20th to 30th ping, packets started dropping out.\nSo I decided to try and spoof my MAC address and - lo and behold - I was able to sustain continuous ping both to the ISP's default gateway and to other hosts on the internet. I do not know if that has solved the problem, but just wanted to post an update. Still testing at this point. If anyone has any ideas please let me know.\nORIGINAL QUESTION: Up until a few days ago, my Xubuntu 14.04 worked just fine. Then I installed security updates and ethernet connection became problematic. It would initially connect just fine, but when doing a continuous ping to, let's say, google I got a staggering 20-70% packet loss. Likewise, browsing would either fail or took a long time to load any page. (Meanwhile, wifi connection still worked flawlessly.)\nGoogle suggested this had to do with the NIC driver (r8169), so I downloaded and installed r8168 but the issue remained the same. Unable to find a viable solution, I restored a partition image prior to the update; apparently, it is now plagued with the same problem.\nAfter further research, I ran ethtool and, sure enough, it showed that the NIC starts off in full-duplex mode, but defaults to half-duplex mode shortly after I start pinging. Forcing full-duplex and disabling auto-negotiation does not solve the issue. I had no success disabling IPv6, either.\nHere's what I can say for sure - it is definitely NOT a hardware problem, because WIN7 gets a solid connection on the same NIC (the machine is dual-boot). Neither is it network related, because all other hosts on the same network get 100% connection as well. I even tried running a Xubuntu live CD but to no avail.\nCan somebody please help me figure this out?\n\nA: BLUF: If all else fails, try spoofing your MAC address and see what happens... :)\nI've double checked everything since posting the update (see above), and couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. Meanwhile - knock on wood - ethernet works well with a fake MAC address. Hope this helps if someone else is having the same problem.\n", "Q: MAAS cluster out of sync I have another issue with MAAS.

Need help Im looking for some assistance, as somehow i managed to kill my GRUB settings, and now i boot into the rescue mode.\nMy system is not the best layed out, as I have Win 8.1 on a UEFI loader, and when i installed Ubuntu, for some unkown reason i had set the bios to go Legacy. It all installed fine, I even installed Kali besides Ubuntu and it was all fine. (I did apparently set GRUB to boot from the Kali install some how).\nSo fast forward to me shrinking the NTFS volume in win 8, and creating a fat32 partition with the plan to be able to pass data between the OS's.\nBooting back into Legacy, Grub returns the error \"unkown filesystem\". I get the rescue mode. Which luckily lets me add in the following:\nset root=(hd0,6)\nset prefix=(hd0,6)/boot/grub\ninsmod normal\nnormal\n\nSo i can get to my grub boot loader.\nBut when i do \nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nthe update grub works fine, but the grub install spits out an error stating \"This GPT partition label contains no BIOS boot partition. embedding wont be possible.\nthen errors out saying it will not proceed with blocklists.\nThis happens on both the Kali install and the Ubuntu install.\nIm guessing one way is to blow away the Kali install, and put a new distro on there, and having it install grub. But im afraid if it goes wrong, ive lost the only way i can get back into my existing Ubuntu distro.\nive also tried boot-repair which fails out with normal fix as well as custom setting telling it to not use the standard EFI file. \nStill i get no where. \nI appreciate any help i can get. \n\nA: While not a perfect fix, I was able to shrink my Windows volume (for the last time) to give me 30Gb free. Then a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onto that free space. Somehow the installation doesnt care about how its set up and just gets the job done. The simple step afterwards was just to fix up the boot preferences in the new ubuntu install so i can tell the difference between the new partition and the old partition.\nWhle im sure this is not what anyone would consider a proper fix, grub is now behaving correctly. And I have a spare install of Ubuntu on the system for whatever i can figure out to do with it.\nIronically, i now have 2 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, a Kali Linux, and a Windows 8.1 on this poor little laptop.\nIf anyone has a better fix, id love to know it.

Right?\n\nA: g++ does support c++11, but it is experimental, hence you have to enable it with the option -std=gnu++11. You don't need to upgrade g++, you can't, because you are already running the latest version. \nSo you will compile using a command like\ng++ -std=gnu++11 ./source_file.cpp\n\nYou may also try the clang compiler, as it has better c++11 support than g++.

When I used OS X there was a shortcut (Cmd+D) that would dismiss the \"Do you want to save\" dialogue when a window with unsaved changes was closed. Is there an equivalent in Ubuntu and if not is there a way to implement this systemwide? \n\n\nA: I have not found a system-wide shortcut (even on OS X, the shortcut may change depending on the application), but there is a way to find the right shortcut for each prompt:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the prompt appears, hold alt and look at the underlined characters (as you would for an application top menu). Of course, we are interested in the \"Close without saving\" option since in general \"Cancel\" maps to escape and \"Save\" maps to enter/space.\n\n*Use alt+[underlined character] to select the corresponding option (as you would to open a menu in an application). Do not mind upper case.\n\n\nAlt mode in Sublime Text: alt+w for the 1st option\n\nNote for those wondering how I could print screen while holding alt: you can either press alt just before the system screenshot is taken, or hold alt from another window of Sublime Text to show underlining (in Sublime Text all windows refer to the same prompt) and then click outside the application to cause a graphical bug that freezes the underlining. I did the latter and used Shutter to take the screenshot.\nIf the text is \"Close without saving\", odds are the magic character is w. If it is \"Don't save\", probably d as in many Mac applications, but not always (see examples below.)\nSome applications are also kind enough to active alt mode automatically, i.e. you can see the magic characters underlined from the beginning and just have to type it to choose the option (without holding alt).\nSome examples below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sublime Text: Close Without Saving\n\n*Text Editor: Close without Saving\n\n*Inkscape: Close without saving\n\n*Libre Office: Close without saving (permanent alt mode)\n\n*ThunderBird: Don't Save\n\n*Geany: Don't Save (permanent alt mode)\n\n*Leafpad, Ted: No\n\n\nAlternatively, you can navigate in the prompt using the left/right arrows and tab/shift+tab, then select the highlighted option with enter/space. However:\n\n\n*\n\n*some applications make you highlight the prompt message when using tab, and the \"close without saving\" option is on the far left while the default selected \"save\" is on the far right, meaning you need to use either tab or the arrow keys twice before pressing enter/space. (Ex: Sublime Text)\n\n*the \"Close without saving\" option is sometimes on the left, sometimes in the middle, so be careful. With Ted, you even have Yes - No - Cancel in this order.\n\n\nTherefore I recommend the second method only when dealing with less common prompts such as Ted's, where navigating once to the right is faster than checking the magic character and using it.\nScreenshot text: from The Bourgeois Gentleman, new translation by Timothy Mooney\n", "Q: How to install ATI graphics card drivers?

(apache 2.4 - ubuntu 14.04) Other than a couple of basic VHOST's, I have default apache and apache logging configuration. \nWhenever I try to view my apache log files (error.log, access.log) I see that these files keep getting reordered and reorganised regularly, unfortunately I don't understand what the reason or methodology of this is.\nFrom what I have read this log file manipulation is performed by a utility called \"logrotate\".\nwith a description from the manpage\n\nlogrotate  is  designed to ease administration of systems that generate\n  large numbers of log files.  It allows automatic rotation, compression,\n  removal, and mailing of log files.  Each log file may be handled daily,\n  weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.\n\nI have read the following resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/understanding-logrotate-utility\n\n*http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html\n\n*https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-logging-and-log-rotation-in-apache-on-an-ubuntu-vps\n\n*http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html#rotation\nThe above resources give a good technical explanation of how you would configure logrotate, but I'm failing to get a common sense explanation of what the point of log rotate is, and therefore some insight into how it works.\nI can see that it performs compression on some files, the benefit of that is obvious.  \nI understand that logrotate is a generic utility that processes log files for many services - and therefore its function changes per each config - but, in the context of apache 2.4 on Ubuntu 14.04 what does \"logrotate\" do?\nUpdate:\nI found this article which I found gave a good common sense explanation of what logrotate does and hopefully may help others who come across this question.\n\nWhen viewing directory listings in /var/log or any of its\n  subdirectories, you may encounter log files with names such as\n  daemon.log.0, daemon.log.1.gz, and so on. What are these log files?\n  They are 'rotated' log files. That is, they have automatically been\n  renamed after a predefined time-frame, and a new original log started.\n  After even more time the log files are compressed with the gzip\n  utility as in the case of the example daemon.log.1.gz. The purpose of\n  log rotation is to archive and compress old logs so that they consume\n  less disk space, but are still available for inspection as needed.\n  What handles this functionality? Why, the logrotate command of course!\n\n\nA: For a service that writes a log file, let's say service.log, the logrotate utility does a couple of things: \n\n\n*\n\n*Start a new (empty) file service.log every day;\n\n*Compress the last service.log to a .gz file so it doesn't take up too much space; the new compressed file gets an index number appended, like service.log.gz.00001;\n\n*The oldest compressed service.log.gz.[index] is deleted.\n\n\nThis way, you can run your service indefinitely without the logs ever growing. All of the above behaviour is configurable.\n", "Q: samba server using active directory logons there is plenty of information on samba, and accessing the server just by the user name and smbpasswd you created on samba.\nHowever, lets say I have a samba server and I joined it to the windows domain \"AD\"\ni have 100 users on windows AD.\nhow would set credentials and permissions for all 100 users on my AD windows server instead of creating a user one by one on linux samba server so they can see my files without me having to create a user on ubuntu server samba?\n\nA: For an existing Samba server using NT4-style authentication, there is an excellent manual over at the samba.org domain.\nBasically what it drills down to is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out which AD servers run what (including ldap, AD, ...)\n\n*Prevent duplicate SIDs\n\n*Correct duplicate user/group names (which AD doesn't like and is standard behaviour in Linux)\n\n*Start the actual upgrade process\n", "Q: How to assign a name to a workspace?

Can I search for the filename in Déjà-dup?\nMany thanks for your help.\n\nA: One simple solution is to use duplicity (on which Déjà-dup sits) and produce a list of files in the backup:\nduplicity list-current-files --no-encryption --time <timestring>  target > list.txt\n\nwhere \"timestring\" is given, according to man duplicity, as: \n\nThe acceptible time strings are intervals (like \"3D64s\"), w3-datetime\n  strings, like \"2002-04-26T04:22:01-07:00\" (strings like\n  \"2002-04-26T04:22:01\" are also acceptable - duplicity will use the\n  current time zone), or ordinary dates like 2/4/1997 or 2001-04-23\n  (various combinations are acceptable, but the month always precedes\n  the day).\n\nand \"target\" is the path to the directory where your backup is.\nIn my case the full command was:\nduplicity list-current-files --no-encryption --time 3D file://mybackup > list.txt\n\nAfter this, you can open \"list.txt\" in any text editor and search for the filename.\nIf you want something more elaborated, have a look on https://askubuntu.com/a/486458/213084\n", "Q: How do I make two ubuntu computers communicate with each other by controlling their wireless cards?

From what I can see maybe I don't actually have to mount the dvd drive, though for certain I have to keep telling VLC the dvd isn't where it thinks it is.      \nI guess my first question is when does one actually have to mount the dvd drive?\nI have two drives on my computer; a cd-rom drive that reads CDs and does absolutely nothing else.  I did not order nor build this computer.   No clue why...   \nI've run different commands and looked in the fstab file.   \nThe file explorer, what ever it's called, maybe Nautilus, maybe not, it has that file drawer icon and exists as the second button on the launcher, and if you type nautilus in the search thing it comes up and calls itself \"Files\", identifies one and only one cd/dvd drive by the name of the last DVD that was in it, such as \"Anglo Saxon Times\".   \nThe fstab file has no reference whatever to dvd drives, just a conflict or two that took place during installation, which could be part of the problem.\nThe command to learn what drives were found when the device booted up finds both of them, and doesn't tell me the name of either of them.  The device names are sr0 and sr1, \nVLC can only find dvds if you tell it to play sr1, which it does not do by default, time after time after time.  Occasionally if you insert a dvd a thing comes up asking what to play it with or whatever, usually nothing at all happens. On the rare occasions that anything at all happens, I got the idea that the computer names the drive CDROM or something close.\nI get the idea that the system may be calling them both \"cdrom\".  In fact they appear to be the same model number of hte same brand, except that they don't have anything resembling the same functionality.   \nWhen I run a command to get more information, I learn that the DVD drive is still sr1, but the other one is now dev/cdrom.\nHow do I find out what the actual names of the cdrom drives are, and then will fixing fstab straighten out the issue the system seems to be having with finding the drives?    \n\nA: sudo lshw -C disk will list your drives. look for sections that start with *-cdrom to find your drive(s). The logical name: entries will be what you'd want to use with players, typically best to use the /dev/srx one where x is a number.\nAs far as vlc - open vlc > Tools > Preferences, (or ctrl+p)  > Input/Codecs & you can set the default drive there in  optical drive from the drop down. It's probably set to /dev/cdrom, you'll change that to /dev/sr1 based on what you've reported.\nAfter changing don't forget to click the save button\n", "Q: How to properly install Go Language in Ubuntu?

I had to use the nvidia 340.29 driver that comes along with the CUDA run file. If you have an integrated Intel graphics card, you must use the --no-opengl-files option.\nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.29.run --no-opengl-files\n\nAt the end of the installation, do NOT let Nvidia reconfigure Xorg config files.\nAfter that, load the Nvidia module:\nsudo modprobe nvidia\n\nand then you can install the CUDA Toolkit and samples:\nsudo ./cuda-linux64-rel-6.5.14-18749181.run\nsudo ./cuda-samples-linux-6.5.14-18745345.run\n\nReboot and verify from the \"Additional Drivers\" section in Systems Settings -> Software & Updates that \"Manually installed driver\" is selected.

Ubuntu cannot mount this drive.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sdb5': Operation not permittedThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown\nWindows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\nread-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\nI'm not using this Windows installation right now, so I don't mind deleting it. What can I do to fix this? Do I have to delete some partitions in the drive? If so which ones? Or is there an easier way?\nThanks.\nEdit: I forgot to mention that the Windows installation is broken so I have no way of booting into it and shutting it down properly. Also, the main partition of the HDD (not the windows partition) has important data.  \nFinal Update (Solution):\nCheck this tutorial. \n\nA: if you wish to delete the windows installation, you can either delete the partition with fdisk or the like, or simply make a new filesystem with the mkfs command, like so:\nmkfs -t <filesystem type> /dev/sdb5, where filesystem type can be any number of supported filesystems, including ntfs, ext{2,3,4}, fat{12,16,32}, and so fourth. But, this seems a bit overkill. You can simply boot the windows partition and properly shut it down.\n\nA: You just have to follow the instructions in the error message.\nWindows was not shut down properly, but suspended (hibernated to be exact). This is also automatically done instead of shutting down if you have enabled the FastBoot option.\nSo now it still has marked the drive as used somehow which prevents Ubuntu from getting full (r+w) access to the drive. You can mount it as read-only without problems, though.\nThe easiest solution to get full access to the drive without doing any damage is to restart your machine, boot into Windows, disable FastBoot if necessary and properly shut it down. Boot Ubuntu up and mount the drive.\nFinished!\n", "Q: Get history of everything I installed? I've made many install commands via the terminal over time, I forget what I installed and I want to uninstall some of them.\nHow can I get the history of everything I installed through the terminal, from beginning till now, ordered by date?\n\nA: You can check the package history logs reside at /var/log/apt/, you will get the names of all the packages installed/removed along with the commands that were used to do so. Moreover you will see the date of the operation too.\nYou will find the latest logs in /var/log/apt/history.log and older logs in gzipped format e.g. /var/log/apt/history.log.1.gz, /var/log/apt/history.log.2.gz etc.\nBy the way, if you just want a list of all the packages currently installed (via dpkg) in the system, you can run:\ndpkg --get-selections | cut -f1 > ~/installed_packages.txt\n\nNow the file installed_packages.txt in your home directory will contain the list of all installed packages.\n", "Q: Plug and play video cards Ok, I am building a high end workstation for bioinformatics analysis. The motherboard I am using is a Supermicro X10 which does NOT have an integrated video card/setup. I plan to install Ubuntu 14.04 and want to know what would be a good, cheap video card for me to get going with the installation process? Subsequently, I plan to install a NVidia card GTX 980 for the graphics. However, I am worried if I start with the GTX 980, I might not be able to install the Ubuntu as NVidia cards are not PnP.\nAm I thinking right about this? Thanks for the favor of a reply.\n\nA: This may probably not be the right place for hardware recommendations but your issue is a bit different to what an average desktop user is faced with.\nIn general all graphic cards need a driver to work with Ubuntu but not all drivers can come with a default Ubuntu installation because they are not Open Source. Another general rule is that brand new very high end graphic cards may not yet be fully supported, have issues, or need untested, bleeding edge drivers. Very old low end cards may not have a sufficient 3D power to run the Ubuntu Unity desktop.\nIntel\nIntel graphics is fully supported because the manufacturer provides Open Source drivers for all features. Alas there are no discrete graphic cards with Intel chips available, as the GPU was mostly already integrated.\nNvidia\nAs you already fopund out newer Nvidia cards may not yet be supported at all by the Open Source nouveau driver. Therefore we will not easily be able to install Ubuntu. Older cards or low end cards will work, but as compared to the radeon driver the nouveau driver still lacks a full support of all features. It may suffice to install Ubuntu but do not expect a fast desktop experience without installing the proprietary Nvidia drivers. Here is a list of supported cards and features.\nAMD\nOther than Intel the Open Source radeon driver is quite advanced and fully supports older or low end graphic cards making them fully capable of running Unity. An incomplete list of fully supported AMD cards is maintained on the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This list can be useful when buying a second hand card to plug in for just installing. From the currently available low end spectrum starting with the CEDAR Radeon 5450 we don't expect any issues. These cards should be fully supported by the Open Source driver supplied with the Ubuntu installation DVD and it should run out of the box.\nAdditional note\nThere will be no issues using the open source drivers radeon or nvidia when switching then graphic card brand but it is not recommended to have proprietary drivers for both, AMD and NVidia running at the same time. Therefore in case you plan to keep a proprietary driver it may be easier to stay with the same brand.\n", "Q: All desktop files goes to google I'm trying to create a desktop file to any page but all of them open google.

When I last tried using link launchers all kinds of weird stuff occured (opened most of the links in Chromium, Firefox new windows all rest of the time, etc)\nAn alternative to adding the #!/usr/bin/env xdg-open line to the top is to make the file executable using this command:\nchmod +x \"/PATH/TO/LAUNCHER.desktop\"\n\nor by making sure this is ticked in the file's properties (under 'permissions'):\n\nSee also: Desktop launcher documentation?\n\nA: The fact is, .desktop files are not scripts. You need to remove the #!/usr/bin/env xdg-open from the top of the file. You do not run them from a terminal either. If you want to open them from a terminal, you would run xdg-open askubuntu.desktop for example. You do need to ensure they are executable to open them from within Nautilus though, as it requires the executable bit to be able to use them as launchers, rather than opening them in the text editor.\n", "Q: How to have the type of boot detected by the kernel and written to a file (perhaps in /proc) This is probably not possible, but I want to know how to have the kernel detect what caused the motherboard to start and possibly store that in a file in the /proc folder.\nWith \"what caused the motherboard to start\" I mean if it was because the power button was pressed, because a Wake On Lan signal was received, because of a scheduled boot, or something else.\n \nI need this because I frequently use my iPhone to start my computer when I get home via Wake On Lan, and I have configured Ubuntu to log in automatically so that when I start using my PC it is ready loading and starting everything scheduled to start at login, such as Skype or Steam.\nHowever, when I use WOL to start it, and Skype goes online, people may think I'm there when I'm not and start messaging me but get no reply from me. When I start the PC using the power button I am usually going to use it right after it's logged in, so my skype contacts won't think I'm there when I'm not. So if I could configure it to not start Skype if a WOL signal initated the boot, but do start Skype if the power button initiated the boot. \n\nA: The way a computer is started is not saved and not passed onto the operating system.\n\nand Skype goes online, people may think I'm there when I'm not\n\nI would assume it would be less trouble to start Skype with your status set to \"off line\" or \"invisible\".\n\nand start messaging me but get no reply from me. \n\nI do not see a problem here.

However, changes are not reflected in /etc/network/interfaces.\nI'm pretty new to Ubuntu. Can anybody help me understand the link between what I do with the ip command suite and the configuration file, please? \n\nA: ip addr add is, as you've seen, for temporary changes. Persistent settings may be edited into /etc/network/interfaces. Use any text editor such as gedit, nano, kate or vim and edit the file. I suggest something like the following:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.101\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8\n\nOf course, select an address outside the DHCP pool used in the router and substitute your details here.\nRestart the interface:\nsudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup -v eth0\n\nAnd test:\nping -c3 www.ubuntu.com\n\n\nA: First, neither tool you are using writes to /etc/network/interfaces , they manage the routing table in the kernel directly.\nSecondly, NetworkManager overides /etc/network/interfaces , so /etc/network/interaaces is only part of the configuration\nFor fruther information see:\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/8/ip\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/what-is-a-routing-table/\nFrom the second link \n\nYour routing table is created automatically, based on the current TCP/IP configuration of your Linux / UNIX computer. You can manually add / modify / edit routing table using route and ip command.\n\nso the ip command(s) you are using are over riding your configuration, not writing a config file\n", "Q: Help with vino (lubuntu) I recently installed lubuntu (amd x64, latest stable) on my... lets call it a server.

The drivers on the site were perfect for our office and we haven't had any issues since installation (02-01-2015). \nI found my drivers on the Konica Minolta Site which were last updated in 2013 by the manufacturer. \nI am very pleased with the performance.\n", "Q: Cant ssh a virtualbox instance - Permission denied, please try again Im using ubuntu and Im trying to create a ssh connection between my ubuntu desktop and virtualbox ubuntu instance.\nI have my ubuntu virtualbox instante configured with bridge, and in my ubuntu desktop Im trying to connect to my virtualbox instance like this: sudo ssh nameofvminstance\nI enter the correct password of my vbox instance, but Im having always the same message: \"Permission denied, please try again\".\nDo you see why this can be happening?\n\nA: Remove sudo, just do:\nssh nameofvminstance\n\nthen enter the password.\nIf you do sudo ssh nameofvminstance, then you are basically trying to log in to the host nameofvminstance as root, if thats the case then at first you need to enter the password of your account in the host computer to get the sudo access and then the password of the root account of nameofvminstance.\nNow if you do ssh nameofvminstance, its basically a short form of ssh username@nameofvminstance where the username in the remote computer is the same as the currently logged in user of the host machine i.e. you can use this format if both usernames are same otherwise you need to mention the username as ssh username@nameofvminstance.\n", "Q: Logarithmic shell expansion?

I'm going to install 64 bit 14.04 on a new machine with something like 1 to maybe 128GB RAM and even more RAM later. How much space should I allocate to the swap partition? \nAnd especially: WHY those recommendations for these numbers? \n(None of the existing answers here and here explain any of the why and are a bit dated if we look at 1GB or RAM and up)\n\nA: Necessity for swap\nSwap is useful for 3 reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing clutter from RAM. From the article on kernel.org: \n\n\"A significant number of the pages referenced by a process early in\n  its life may only be used for initialisation and then never used\n  again. It is better to swap out those pages and create more disk\n  buffers than leave them resident and unused\"\n\nIn other words, the data stored in RAM may only be useful when a process has been started (like the startup process), and then simply reside there in RAM, cluttering space which can be used for better purposes. \n\n*It expands the amount of memory that processes may use. This is well understood. You don't want the system to run out of memory and crash due to lack of it. For this specific reason, swap must exist , serving as a protective feature.\n\n*Hibernation: When a computer hibernates, the contents of RAM go to disk.\nSwap amount\nKnowing the purpose for swap and depending on your machine's RAM amount , you can choose a swap size that fits your purpose. There aren't specific guidelines, only rules of thumb which you can use to tailor your swap size to fit your system.\nFor instance, linux.com recommends:\n\nA rule of thumb is as follows: 1) for a desktop system, use a swap\n  space of double system memory, as it will allow you to run a large\n  number of applications (many of which may will be idle and easily\n  swapped), making more RAM available for the active applications; 2)\n  for a server, have a smaller amount of swap available (say half of\n  physical memory) so that you have some flexibility for swapping when\n  needed, but monitor the amount of swap space used and upgrade your RAM\n  if necessary; 3) for older desktop machines (with say only 128MB), use\n  as much swap space as you can spare, even up to 1GB.\n\nFrom personal experience, here's what I'd do:\nConsidering a machine with 1 - 2 GB that doesn't need to hibernate and for casual usage, you can have 1GB to 2GB swap space. My PC with 14.04 Ubuntu has 1GB of RAM and 2GB swap. The swap amount never crosses the 800MB border, and I use my PC only for surfing the web and scripting. \nWith a PC that has over 2GB and you don't need to hibernate, you may keep swap from 512MB to 1GB. I have a laptop with 15.04 which I don't hibernate ever and which has a swap file (not a partition) of 512 MB. RAM itself is 6 GB but doesn't cross 2-3 GB ever. Again: casual usage. \nCosmoscalibur and Fabby already addressed swap in case you need to hibernate, so I won't go into that too extensively. My humble opinion is this: \nIf you plan on hibernating, RAM contents will need to be swapped out, hence you need it at least the same size as your RAM. \n\nA: The short answer:\nSet your swap file to:\n\n*\n\n*round(sqrt(RAM)) if you don't use hibernation\n\n*RAM+round(sqrt(RAM)) if you do use hibernation\n\nSet your swappiness to 10 on a desktop, but not on a server!\nThe long answer:\nIn the past:\nThe rule of thumb in use for the last 25 years has been a minimum of 1xRAM and maximum 2xRAM so that is what you'll see quoted all the time.\nThat minimum was set back in the stone age when I was a teenager and dinosaurs still roamed the Earth and because RAM was just too expensive and you absolutely needed that swap space to be able to accomplish anything.\nThe maximum was set at that time because of diminishing returns: it's just too slow to have to swap so much memory as HDD access is a factor of 1000 slower then RAM: good in an emergency, but not really good for everyday use! At the time, when you ran out of swap space, it was time to add more RAM! (which is still true today).\nIn the present:\n\n*\n\n*If you do not use hibernation and your memory is in excess of 1GByte the new rule of thumb is round(sqrt(RAM)) where RAM is obviously your RAM size in GB and sqrt the square root. :-)\n\n\n*If you use hibernation, you need to be able to swap the entire amount of RAM+already swapped RAM to disk, thus the formula becomes: RAM+round(sqrt(RAM))\n\n\n*The rule of diminishing returns still holds today for the maximum, but unless you test your actual usage, taking 2xRAM is just a waste of disk space, so don't use the maximum unless you run out of swap space using the other methodologies.\nAll of these together give you the following table:(last 3 columns denoting swap space)\n    RAM   No hibernation    With Hibernation    Maximum\n    1GB              1GB                 2GB        2GB\n    2GB              1GB                 3GB        4GB\n    3GB              2GB                 5GB        6GB\n    4GB              2GB                 6GB        8GB\n    5GB              2GB                 7GB       10GB\n    6GB              2GB                 8GB       12GB\n    8GB              3GB                11GB       16GB\n   12GB              3GB                15GB       24GB\n   16GB              4GB                20GB       32GB\n   24GB              5GB                29GB       48GB\n   32GB              6GB                38GB       64GB\n   64GB              8GB                72GB      128GB\n  128GB             11GB               139GB      256GB\n  256GB             16GB               272GB      512GB\n  512GB             23GB               535GB        1TB\n    1TB             32GB              1056GB        2TB\n    2TB             46GB              2094GB        4TB\n    4TB             64GB              4160GB        8TB\n    8TB             91GB              8283GB       16TB\n\nThe above is just a rule of thumb; it's not the law of gravity!\nYou can break this rule (unlike the law of gravity) if your particular use case is different!\nPro tip: Always allocate SWAP at the start of a HDD as the heads need to move less on the inside of the disk.\nYes: On SSDs, it doesn't really matter any more where you locate the swap area as they use quantum-tunnelling instead of moving heads and modern SSDs use all of their memory cells (even the unallocated space) to prevent quantum degradation.\nHow to test if your usage of swap is different from the \"generic\" rule:\nJust execute:\nfor szFile in /proc/*/status ; do \n  awk '/VmSwap|Name/{printf $2 \"\\t\" $3}END{ print \"\" }' $szFile \ndone | sort --key 2 --numeric --reverse | more\n\nwhich will give you a list of all running programs that are swapped out (with the one using the most swap space on top)\nIf you're using more then a few KB: resize to more then the minimum, otherwise, don't bother...\nIf you're on a server, stop reading now: you're all set!\n\nIf you're on a desktop/laptop client (not server), you want your GUI to be as responsive as possible and only swap when you really need to.  Ubuntu has been optimised to swap early for server use, but on your client you want editing that huge 250 Mega-pixel raw picture in gimp to be speedy, so setting your swappiness to 10 will keep the kernel from swapping too early, while ensuring it doesn't swap too late:\nIf you have a sysctl.conf file,\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nOR\nIf you have a sysctl.d directory but no sysctl.conf file, create a new file:\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/35_swap.conf \n\nand in both cases add:\n# change \"swappiness\" from default 60 to 10 \n# (theoretically only swap when RAM usage reaches around 80 or 90 percent)\nvm.swappiness = 10\n\nto the end of the file, save the file (Ctrl+XY+Enter in nano) and execute a:\nsysctl --system\n\nto reload the parameter or take the Window$ approach and reboot... :-)\n", "Q: How to dual boot Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu on the same hard drive? After being away from Linux based machines for a long time, I've recently come into possession of an ASUS X551MA running an Intel Celeron N2830 @ 2.16 with 4 GB of RAM and a 500GM HD. I decided that I wanted to get back into dual booting on my school PC for fun, and now find myself wondering how the hell to do it properly. \nI used to run Wubi on one of my old PCs, but, when I updated to Windows 8 everything went out the window. \nMy question is, I guess, firstly is it possible for me to either run Wubi on this machine with Windows 8.1, or, secondly, if that's not possible is there another method which I could use to dual boot 8.1/Ubuntu?\n\nA: I was able to install 14.04 (64 bit) on a Toshiba NB10t-A with very similar specifications. I did it with a live CD. And after fiddling around a bit... I was able to get Grub to load up when my computer booted and I was in business. This involved switching from UEFI mode, to the other mode (I forget the precise name of it, for the life of me), which didn't work... and so I then switched back to UEFI mode, which caused Grub to spontaneously start working. These are the instructions I followed.\nYou might want to deviate from these particular instructions just a  bit, I'm not a fan of how they prompt you to partition your hard drive when installing Ubuntu, but other than that... they should send you well on your way.\nFeel free to contact me directly or comment here if you have questions about how I did a particular step, etc.\n\nA: Firstly, yes, it is possible to run Wubi but it is neither recommended nor officially supported. \nI found a post of user hakuna_matata with a workaround for Wubi 14.10. It is too difficult for me to understand hakuna_matata's post. But there is also a link to a dropbox folder.\nI decided to use wubi1410SB.exe of this folder because it seemed to me the most powerful version of the folder. Maybe, it was not a good idea to download an unsigned .exe file but this patched version worked like a charm on my system (Windows 8.1, 64bit, UEFI)\n", "Q: Chrome window display issue I m running Ubuntu 14.04 with ATI Raedon 6670 video card.

I don't think that there is data corruption on your USB drive, but please check with md5sum.txt.\nI don't know why the installer tries to fetch this file from the local pool, when this file is not in md5sum.txt, where I guess it should be and it's unlikely that it's in casper. This confuses me, too. You can try downloading the package and copy it to the USB drive manually. May be that is the only issue and everything will be fine after that.\nAlternatively you could use the loopback method I just added to my answer (it was long overdue). You would need to modify the ISO or find other ways to include your preseed file, but wouldn't run into filesystem issues or other things that I currently don't know about. \n", "Q: Problem with Broadcom BCM43142 wireless driver on 14.04 I have been facing some issues with the wireless drivers on my lenovo Z5070 laptop.

I just want now to remove \"7\" and install\n Windows 8.1 .\nShould I just insert Windows 8.1 CD and start installation as I would do on \"normal\" ,non dual boot systems?\nIs that possible without corrupting and/or doing anything with Ubuntu partition because in the past I installed Ubuntu after Windows 7?\nIs the order of installing important and what are the main differences?\n\nA: Although the specific instructions totally depend on your situation, partitioning etc. You should insert Windows 8 disc and replace Windows 7 (if you want that removed of course), simply format Windows 7 partition and install Windows 8.\nAfter doing so, your GRUB bootloader will be inaccessible, you should insert and boot an Ubuntu LiveCD and fix GRUB (using commands or GUI tools like grub-customizer).\n\nA: There are a few details missing in your question like the partition layout and firmware type of your computer (BIOS or UEFI). Usually Windows 7 installations are BIOS/MBR, which means the Ubuntu bootloader (GRUB) would be overwritten with every operating system you are going install, it doesn't matter if its Windows 7, Windows 8 or something else and you would need to reinstall GRUB to restore dual boot functionality: How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\n\n Newer systems with properly working UEFI don't have this limitation of a single bootloader per disk, but a lot of UEFI systems sold up until now are designed as Windows only booting devices. An invasive design decision that wasn't anyhow required by Microsoft for traditional computers, but forced onto users by probably the same guys who'd thought that Superfish-like malware would add value to the user experience and a connection made to your bank or any other critical site with this thing sniffing all the traffic would still be secure. (It's not.) That's why there is much uncertainty with Windows 8 and Linux, thought there's nothing wrong with both of them. \n\n", "Q: Have ssh try a LAN IP before the internet address I have a home server connected to my local LAN and the internet. \nSay its LAN IP is \n192.169.0.10 \n\nand it has an internet address of \nawesomeserver.no-ip.org (DNS alias). \nI access it regularly from a laptop over ssh. I want to configure my laptop so that it first tries the LAN IP for more speed, if that doesn't work it should fall back to the internet address. How is this possible? It should work with nautilus' sftp connections as well as terminal ssh commands.\n\nA: Use the DNS name. When routing traffic from the LAN, the router will resolve the name awesomeserver.no-ip.org and discover that it is equal to its own Internet-facing IP address. Then it will look through its list of \"virtual server\" addresses (or whatever NAT is called on the router) and forward the traffic to 192.168.0.10. The traffic from your laptop will not get outside your LAN.\n", "Q: How to dump user's environment into a file?

To save it into a file use output redirection:\nenv > env.log\n\n\nA: As the user you can do:\nenv > env.log\n\nA file called env.log will be written in the current directory. If you want it somewhere else, you can use the path like this: env > /var/log/userenv.log. A double \">\" will append to the file instead of overwriting. If the file does not exist, it will be created in any case as long as you have write access to the location.\n\nA: printenv > env.txt will create a file with all the environment variable name and value pairs.\n", "Q: icon scaling seems to work partially on a dell 4k display.

The scaling seems to work properly 'inside application border' but when I move the pointer outside the border (of that application), i.e., entering to the desktop background (plain background without any windows) the cursor gets rescaled to its original size (half the size in my case). The same thing happens when the cursor moves into any application's titlebar area.\nIt doesn't seems to find a fix for it easily (or blame my poor googling skill) I could use some of your helps here. Thanks.\n\nA: I can offer you no improvement in the situation. But I have an explanation for you. The 4K technology is relatively new. On the other hand your system is relatively old. If you want to improve the situation, then you must use newer software versions. A first step is to update your system to Vivid or to Wily in some days. And then the application developers are required.

Imagine you set up your root filesystem to be btrfs with Ubuntu 14.10 defaults (one subvolume for / and one for /home) and you want to compress and deduplicate as much as possible. Which directories should be managed as a proper subvolume and disabled for compression? The two targets \"compress as much as possbile\" and skip compression of certain parts for performance reasons are mutually exclusive, therefore let me clarify the question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Certain sets of files and directories seem to suffer from compression (e.g. dpkg takes up to 30 minutes reading the package list after update) (with zlib compression after btrfs filesystem defragment -c) disabling compression for /var/lib/dpkg/ speeds up things by factor 1000. Are there further examples for such performance impacts (dpkg's database isn't very performant).\n\n*Directories containing source code (/src/ and others) are good candidates for compression although they will be mostly read when the system compiles and therefore the CPU load will be high and CPU-intensive decompression has to be done. How to estimate or measure the tradeoff?\n\n\nA: I believe that per-subvolume compression is not available yet. From the BTRFS wiki:\n\nMost mount options apply to the whole filesystem, and only the options for the first subvolume to be mounted will take effect. This is due to lack of implementation and may change in the future.\nThis means that (for example) you can't set per-subvolume nodatacow, nodatasum, or compress using mount options. This should eventually be fixed, but it has proved to be difficult to implement correctly within the Linux VFS framework.\n\nUnless you have information to the contrary, your plan won't work (yet).\n", "Q: If I don't log in right away on my 14.04 LTS system, the login hangs My newly dual booting system is working great with this one annoyance scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*I boot the system, but don't touch anything.\n\n*The screen eventually goes dark.\n\n*I touch a key and get the login screen.\n\n*I enter my password and hit enter.\n\n*The login screen disappears, but I never get the desktop.

Selected \"Unknown Device\" as option (b) did nothing. \n3) After this, saw a GRUB ver 2.02 screen with the first option of *Ubuntu, which then eventually got me into Ubuntu.\nThe above sequence of steps occurs everytime I reboot my machine.\nWhy all these steps?\nFYI, here is my boot-repair info: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10562192/\nYou will notice that on lines: 549, 741 and 776, I am getting the line:\nBoot0000* Unknown Device:   HD(1,800,100000,aa8f4a18-e5fc-41ff-bb2d-826eab7312c9)File(EFIubuntushimx64.efi)RC\n\nWould this be the reason I am getting the \"Unknown Device\" in my Boot Manager?\nThanks.\n\nA: The \"Shim UEFI Key Management\" screen is probably MokManager, which manages Secure Boot keys used by the Shim program. Shim is a signed pre-GRUB boot loader whose job is to enable Linux to boot on a computer that uses Secure Boot. Secure Boot is a complex topic; see my page on the subject (or many other pages; Google to find a selection) for more details.\nThe fact that you're seeing the same MokManager screen pop up on every boot means that either you're not registering a key or your firmware is forgetting them. If you're able to get into Ubuntu without registering a key, then my suspicion is that you've got at least two Linux boot paths registered; one is failing and then the other is launching. If you do register a key, then as I said, your firmware is forgetting them.\nPosting your Boot Repair pastebin file would be helpful, yes.\n", "Q: Getting an up-to-date Version of Skype? The officially distributed version of Skype for Ubuntu is really annoying to use (really outdated), and I want something as close as possible to the Windows experience. I have tried using WINE, which works not at all, and the Pidgin plugin is really rudimentary. I know there is always Hangouts, but all my friends are on Skype and that's not going to change. What method of Skype for Ubuntu gives the most updated experience and best sound quality?\n(LUbuntu 14.04)\n\nA: The easiest way to get the latest version of skype is from the official website. Unfortunently it's really outdated compared to the windows OS, but there's not much else to do but wait and hope until Microsoft releases a new update. \nAccording to WineHQ someone managed to install Skype 5 using wine. Apparently setting the windows version to windows 8 allows it to work.\n", "Q: Dual Boot Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7 Grub Issue I am trying to dual boot windows 7 (3TB hard drive) and Ubuntu 14.04 (1TB hard drive). I already have windows installed and am trying to install Ubuntu, however, the option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 is not shown. This may have to do with the GPT partition table I am using for windows, since I am using a 3TB hard drive. Is there a way to get Ubuntu to recognize a GPT partition table?\n\nA: If you've got two separate hard disks, I recommend using the \"Something Else\" partitioning option; I'm not sure if the more automatic options will work with multiple disks. Besides, you know where you want things to go, and the installer doesn't.\nUbuntu has long supported GPT; that's not an issue. You should be wary, though, of boot modes. If Windows is installed to a GPT disk, it must be booting in EFI mode. If you install Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, that will create complications. See my page on EFI-mode Linux installations, this Ubuntu documentation page, or this askubuntu question about installing Ubuntu and Windows 8. You shouldn't need to do anything special because of your second disk, aside from using the \"Something Else\" partitioning option.\n", "Q: Steam game does not use all available CPU power When I quit a Steam game today I noticed on CPU Usage Monitor widget graph that it did not run on 100% CPU load which came as a surprise considering that simply scrolling askubuntu.com in Firefox uses half of my netbook's CPU power and that the game – running on roughly 15-20 FPS – is barely playable with detail level set to minimum.\nIs there a way to give the game more CPU power? My OS in Lubuntu 14.10.\n\nA: It may not be a problem of CPU, but video card or available RAM size. Actually some games are poorly optimized and even setting the lowest quality may still require a lot of resources. Also, if you have multicore CPU, it might be that game can't utilize more than one (or two) cores - it's a known issue that can't be helped. \n", "Q: Unable to install Vertica 7 on Ubuntu 14.10 I try to instal Vertica on my Ubuntu 14.10.

Thus, when you re-installed GRUB, you trashed your existing first partition! That partition was probably either your EFI System Partition (ESP), where your EFI boot loaders go, or perhaps some other Windows-specific boot partition.\nThere's a slim chance that you can overcome this problem by resetting the type code on your first partition and using dosfsck or some other filesystem-recovery tool on it; but you may need to re-create the partition's contents from scratch. This is possible, but tricky. I don't have a URL handy to a procedure, but try a Web search on terms like \"fixing damaged EFI System Partition.\" The ESP is basically a FAT partition that holds EFI boot loaders, which are ordinary files, so the recovery procedure will involve laying down a fresh FAT filesystem and restoring the files by copying them from another source or using a Windows recovery tool.\nAs a meta-comment, installing Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode to a computer that already has Windows running in EFI/UEFI mode is doing things the hard way, at best. It's much better to install both OSes in the same mode, as described in this page I wrote. If you hadn't trashed your ESP, it would be relatively simple to add an EFI boot loader for Linux to the ESP to work around your initial problem, but now you've got to restore your Windows boot loader, and possibly adjust your boot loader NVRAM entries.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Need to install dont no how BRAND NEW I am brand new to linux and basicly I want to install Ubuntu 14.4 and dual boot with windows 8 please help me.\n\nA: During the install process...\n~You'll be asked to pick a username and password. \n.....When you pick the username, the name of your computer will automatically appear also.\n~Then it will ask you to pick a password.\n.....You'll be asked for this many times when you use Ubuntu, so if there's no one else who has access to your system, you might want to make it short, \n.....on the other hand, for security reasons you might want to make it strong - 8 characters or more, not your SS#, bank info, and no recognizable names or words.\n~Then it will offer 3 choices:\n1. log in automatically,\n2.

What can I try?\nI'm using the newly released Thinkpad X250 which has one of the 15 W Broadwell processors. I've read posts detailing the various steps involved in getting vanilla Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 working with the laptop so I decided to give the current state of 15.04, especially because I'm interested in getting the the newest stable graphic drivers for the graphics integrated into the processor.\nI downloaded the Friday March 6 2015 lubuntu daily for the 15.04 (http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/daily-live/current/) 64 bit image and the installation went very well, except that full disk encryption with LUKS failed, citing some swap space that may allow for partial recovery of the encryption key. The freshly installed operating system worked great - the linux version of Team Fortress 2 ran at respectable frame rates at settings i found acceptable, the trackpad works well enough (no side scrolling), trackpoint works, wireless lan works like a dream, and brightness changing buttons work as expected. \nThe main problems are that the trackpad buttons are mapped to different (and useless) keypresses and that the sound doesn't work at all. Is there anything I can try to enable sound on the machine other than hoping for a fix via sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade?\n\nA: This blog post by Adam Olsen describes the most common issue with getting the Thinkpad X250 working with a recent Ubuntu version. I assume that most of the problems are still present and solve the same way in the upcoming 15.04 version:\nQuoting inline:\n\n\nTo make this work, create a file at /lib/firmware/x250.fw with the following contents:\n[codec]\n0x10ec0292 0x17aa2226 0\n[pincfg]\n0x16 0x21211010\n0x19 0x21a11010\n\n... then, create a file called /etc/modprobe.d/hda-intel.conf with the following contents:\n\noptions snd-hda-intel patch=x250.fw,x250.fw,x250.fw\n\n\nReboot, and the audio port on your dock should work. I imagine the process is the same for any of 2015 thinkpads. With each thinkpad, the only number that changes is the second one under the [codec] heading (in this case, 0x17aa2226). That information can be found by downloading this script: http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh, and running it via bash alsa-info.sh as root. Search for 0x17aa in the output, and you'll find the other half of the number you need.\n\n", "Q: Nvidia Nightmare I have an old AMD64 box that was working quite nicely on in 12.04 LTS with onboard Nvidia GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 chip but ONLY running Nvidia 302.7 which I learned the HARD way after trying just about every other driver. My son gave me an Nvidia GeForce 8800GTS card and my nightmare began.\nTo make a VERY long story short, the new to me graphics card ran just fine in the XP part of the dual-boot but Linux was Hell. Finally I gave up and \"upgraded\" to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in an effort to fix the problem. I'm about sixty hours in and removed the 8800GTS card. I just want my system to work again. Nouveau graphics so slow they look like they are in another time zone. Move the mouse, go get a cup of coffee, and when I come back, I see the cursor move. I know that sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-302.07.run has fixed my graphics problems in the past. However, I get the error that [...]/version.h does not exist, most likely reason is that source files in /lib/modules/3.13.0-32-generic/build have not been configured. HOW do I get them configured?\nYes, I have updated, upgraded, installed linux linux-headers-generic ubuntu-minimal ubuntu-standard ubuntu-desktop and linux-generic all without having a version.h file appear. And yes, I wiped my drive and made a fresh install of 14.04 after removing the 8800 card because the gui was horribly broken.\nCan anyone offer help getting my box to work with just the onboard graphics? I do not care about the 8800 card. I am pretty sure if I can JUST install nvidia 302.7 that my life will return to the halcyon days of 12.04, but in 14.04. Thank you.\n\nA: Reinstalling Ubuntu 12.04.1 was the only solution to get a copy of version.h, but planting it in Ubuntu 14.04 did not help. Eventually I realized that within 14.04 I could load the oldest available driver in Ubuntu, Nvidia 173.14.39, with only one problem. Coming out of hibernate the entire screen is too distorted to read. \nThat can be fixed with unity --replace & which repaints the entire display screen. \nSo I edited ~/.bash_aliases to add an alias I called \"fixit.\" \nalias fixit 'unity --replace &'  \n\nWhen you wake from hibernation and cannot read anything, hit Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal. Type fixit and hit Enter. You do not have to be able to read to do this. The screen blinks and everything is rewritten perfectly legibly. Then close the terminal window that you opened a moment ago. \nNote: If I knew where to add the unity --replace command so that it runs every time the box wakes up from hibernation, I would put it there so that it works automatically.\n", "Q: How to automatically bring an activated window to the foreground?

Can't boot Windows after attempting to install Ubuntu Attempted to install Ubuntu 14.04 on a separate partition from Win7 64-bit, but something went wrong with the install, and I am no longer able to boot from either the Win7 or the Ubuntu partition.  Further, I cannot boot the Win7 disk in order to effect repairs.\nHowever, I am able to boot from the Ubuntu Live Disk.  Ubuntu recognizes the hard drive and the partitions but can not access its data. \nWhen using the graphical interface in GParted, it appears that sda5, mount point Ubuntu-vg is superimposed on sda2, extended partition, and not side by side like one would expect.  sda1 is a NTFS partition. \nI have run Boot-Repair three times without a fix, and each time the result was different. Here is the most recent... \n[broken link removed]\nBeing a newbie, I do not understand what these messages mean, or how to proceed without doing more damage. \nI would like to be able to save the hard drive data, and boot to both Win7 and Ubuntu partitions through a boot manager.\n\nA: Your /dev/sda2 is an extended partition, which means that it's a placeholder for one or more logical partitions. Thus, what you're seeing in GParted is normal. Furthermore, your Boot Repair output indicates that you're using a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) setup, which is why you can't directly access /dev/sda5 -- it's further subdivided in an LVM way. None of this is cause for concern by itself, although an LVM setup is relatively advanced, and I think you've misconfigured it....\nYour disk has SYSLINUX installed in the MBR, which is unusual but not necessarily wrong. (Ubuntu uses GRUB by default, not SYSLINUX.) When using an LVM, though, you normally have a separate /boot partition, but you don't seem to have one. Furthermore, your /dev/sda1 is marked with a Linux partition type code (0x83), and it's of a reasonable size to be /boot; but Boot Repair has identified it as being NTFS and holding Windows boot files.\nOverall, it looks to me as if you followed advanced instructions for Ubuntu installation but mis-read one or more steps and ended up with a rather mangled hash of things. My recommendation is to back up any user files (using a Windows emergency disk), wipe both your disks clean, and start again with re-installing both Windows and Ubuntu, but don't try to be as fancy in your installation. If wiping Windows is too painful to contemplate, then you could try recovering that and start over just with Ubuntu. You'd probably need to use fdisk to change the type code of /dev/sda1 from 0x83 to 0x07, delete /dev/sda5 and then /dev/sda2, and then ask on a Windows forum about recovery. Be careful, though! It's entirely possible that you'll dig yourself in even deeper -- for instance, if /dev/sda and /dev/sde change identities (as can happen), you might delete your NTFS partitions if you follow this advice.\nRemember: Backups are your friends!\n", "Q: Areas around windows and my desktop background show visual artifacts / distortions I am currently using Ubuntu 14.04.02.

And only with Something Else, do you\n  get the options for more than the default / & swap.\n\nThanks!\n\nA: There are two separate (but related) technological dichotomies that you seem to be conflating, at least a bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS vs. EFI/UEFI -- This is the type of firmware in the computer; it's software that's built in to chip(s) on the motherboard. Since the 1980s, PCs have used Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware, but the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) was developed in the 1990s, lurked for over a decade as an obscure option on Itanium systems, was adopted by Apple for its Intel-based Macs, and has most recently been used as a BIOS replacement on the vast majority of PCs sold since mid-2011 or thereabouts. (EFI 2.x is known as the Unified EFI, or UEFI.) Although some PCs used EFI prior to 2011, chances are your 2009 laptop is not one of them, so you really can't use EFI on it. (You might be able to get a \"software EFI\" such as DUET or Clover to work on your system, but this is more trouble than it's worth for most people.)\n\n*MBR vs. GPT -- PCs have historically used the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system. This is just a set of standards for how to arrange data on the disk so that the OS can find the partitions. EFI includes a new partitioning system known as the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which eliminates many MBR kludges and limitations. Although GPT is defined as part of the EFI specification, it may be used even on older BIOS-based computers. GPTs biggest advantages are with disks over 2TiB in size, which MBR can't handle. On smaller disks, GPT has several minor advantages, but nothing compelling enough to make switching to it a necessity for most users. Note that some OSes, including Windows, cannot boot from GPT disks except in EFI mode -- and of course most older OSes, such as DOS and most versions of Windows prior to Vista SP1, can't boot in EFI mode or use GPT even for data disks.\n\n\nThe term \"EFI partition\" is somewhat ambiguous because that is not, AFAIK, an official moniker. In the paragraph you quoted, it seems to be referring to an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a partition on which EFI boot loaders and similar EFI tools are stored. An ESP is 100% useless on a BIOS-based computer, so if your laptop is BIOS-based, as I suspect, there's no point in creating an ESP even if you use GPT. BIOS-based computers that have GPT disks and boot with GRUB instead use a BIOS Boot Partition, which is a small (typically 1MiB) partition that holds part of GRUB. The BIOS Boot Partition is identified in different ways depending on the partitioning tool you use. In parted, GParted, and other libparted-based tools, it has a bios_grub flag set. In gdisk and its siblings, it's identified by a type code of EF02.\nIf you pre-partition your disk and want to use GPT, create a BIOS Boot Partition and whatever other partitions you'd normally use. If you anticipate eventually moving the disk to a newer EFI-based computer, you might create an ESP, too, but that's almost certainly just a (small) waste of disk space at this time. (ESPs are typically 100-600MiB in size.)\n\nA: If your system comes pre-installed with UEFI firmware (which is a BIOS replacement) and you want the novelty and the experience, then keep it!\nIf your system doesn't come with UEFI: don't bother as UEFI was supposed to give us more freedom, but most vendors use it to lock you in and take your freedom away!\nGPT is an entirely different question: Go for it!  Finally more then 4 primary partitions per disk!  The only disadvantage is that you'll have to give up on old trusty fdisk and use parted instead.\nparted /dev/XdY\n\n(where X and Y are very probably \"s\" and \"a\").
