["Q: How to refresh privileges on a script? I have an script that modify files and group permissions. But it doesn't bring effects 'till I close the session and open a new one.\nInstructions where permissions are changed:\nsudo groupadd --system webapps\nsudo useradd --system --gid webapps --home /home/lucio/server/webapps/hello_django hello\nsudo chown -R hello:webapps .\nsudo chmod -R g+w .\nsudo usermod -a -G webapps `whoami`\n\nInstruction where I get the error:\ncd /home/lucio/server/webapps/\ncp assets/gunicorn_start.bash.template hello_django/bin/gunicorn_start.bash\n\nThe last line gives me the following error:\ncp: cannot create regular file 'hello_django/bin/gunicorn_start.bash': Permission denied\n\nThis should help:\n\nI have tried using login username after changes privileges but that does absolutely nothing.\nHow can I update the privileges without exit from the script?\n\nA: I think the best you can do is to run the commands you need to run using sg. \nDESCRIPTION\n   The sg command works similar to newgrp but accepts a command. The\n   command will be executed with the /bin/sh shell. With most shells you\n   may run sg from, you need to enclose multi-word commands in quotes.\n   Another difference between newgrp and sg is that some shells treat\n   newgrp specially, replacing themselves with a new instance of a shell\n   that newgrp creates. This doesn't happen with sg, so upon exit from a\n   sg command you are returned to your previous group ID.\n\nSo, after you have created the group and added yourself to it, you will be able to run commands as a member of that group with sg groupname command. So, for example, this will work:\nsudo groupadd --system webapps\nsudo useradd --system --gid webapps --home /home/lucio/server/webapps/hello_django hello\nsudo chown -R hello:webapps .\nsudo chmod -R g+w .\nsudo usermod -a -G webapps $(whoami)\n\n## From now on, run all commands through sg\nsg webapps \"mkdir foorbar\"\n\nSince that will be a pain to write, I would put it in a function:\nrun_as_webapps() sg webapps \"$@\"\n\nThen, call whatever commands you need to call using that function\nrun_as_webapps mkdir foobar\n\nAnd the end of the day though, it might be easier to just run the whole script as root instead. Either that or have two scripts, one to set up the groups and another to do everything else. Just log out and log back in before running the second one.\n\nThe POSIX specification clearly states that functions should be defined in this way:\nfoo () command\n\nFor reasons I don't understand, the OP had trouble with this and instead had to use\nfunction run_as_webapps(){\n    sg webapps \"$@\"\n}\n\n", "Q: Wireless card problems I'm new to linux so forgive me if this is redundant or unclear. I just finished installing ubuntu (14.04); however, when I try to connect to a wireless network via settings or the top menum I am not seeing a wireless connection option at all. Before installing ubuntu originally, I used the \"Try ubuntu without installing\" option. I quickly noticed the same problem. Through a little research I was able to find that I could use the \"additional drivers\" option to install the standard Broadcom driver which would give me back the wireless functionality that I was lacking. After partitioning my hard drive and installing ubuntu, I ran into the same problem as far as no wireless option showing up. I attempted to solve the problem with the previously mentioned method but when I click \"Apply Changes\" in the \"Additional Drivers\" tool, it appears as if the driver begins to install and then just stops without completing its install. I've tried this numerous times after restarting and reinstalling but ultimately I always come to the same ends. I tried looking both here and elsewhere on the internet for a possible workaround or solution to my problem and all I am able to find is half-written terminal commands that are nearly illegible to a new-user such as myself.\nIf anyone has a possible work-around or solution simple enough for a beginner to accomplish, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: After a little more research, I was able to find a set of terminal commands that allowed me to reinstall the driver without incident.\n", "Q: Pari GP most current version?

I currently am running Pari 2.5.5 from the current Ubuntu 14.4 LTS.\n\nA: Software from third parties are only updated when a new release comes out, so if the newest version of the application was released and had time to be tested before ubuntu's freeze on adding new software it could have been included in 14.04.\nTo answer your question the soonest it will become available in the repositories will be at the next release of ubuntu if ubuntu still chooses to include it in the repositories, so if you must have the latest you will need to get it from the third party developer, but it is best that it is in an trusted ppa or .deb package.\nIf the application is in a ppa you can add it so it can be installed with software center.\nIf you can download it in a .deb package you just need to double click on it to install it with software center.\nIt looks like it is available on there site in source code format though. \n\nA: I think I found what I was looking for:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/utopic/amd64/pari-gp/2.7.1-1\nAfter installing this it seems to work.\nThanks Wild man, it help to know what to look for.\n", "Q: delete XP from dual boot?

Is it an extension? A shell specific version? Take a look at this screenshot:\n\n\nA: This is a feature that comes only with older versions of GNOME. The screenshot you are looking at is of an older version of GNOME Shell. In versions of GNOME prior to 3.8, there was a category selector on the right side as your screenshot shows. In GNOME 3.8, the category filter was removed and applications can now be launched using either a \"Frequent\" or \"All\" filter.\nCompare the following two screenshots of the GNOME Activities Overview from two successive releases of GNOME.\nGNOME 3.6 Activities Overview\n\nThis screenshot from the GNOME 3.6 Activities Overview Release Notes shows the application categories on the right side.\nGNOME 3.8 Activities Overview\n\nThis screenshot from the GNOME 3.8 Release Notes shows the lack of categories and the \"Frequent\" and \"All\" filters at the bottom of the screen instead.\nThis change in the Activities Overview was an intentional design change. More can be read about this design change in the \"Stage 2\" section of this application picker design document on the GNOME wiki.\n\nA: This is an old answer but it helped me today so I thought I'd share it.  This blog post goes into some detail but the practical upshot is that you can add categories to org.gnome.shell => app-folder-categories using dconf-editor to tell the dash to group up your items.\nHere's the dconf location:\n\nThe recommended value of\n['Utilities', 'Games', 'Sundry', 'Office', 'Network', 'Internet', 'Graphics', 'Multimedia', 'System', 'Development', 'Accessories', 'System Settings', 'wine-wine', 'Crossover', 'Crossover Games', 'Science', 'Education', 'Universal Access', 'chrome-apps', 'Other']\nworked well for me on gnome-shell 3.10.4-0ubuntu5.2.\n", "Q: How do I run a application on top/in a display manager like GDM? I was wondering if there is a way to run a application like Onboard on a display manager like GDM.  If it depends on the display manager than please post the GDM instructions, or all of the popular display managers.  The reason why I need Onboard running while using GDM is I am learning the Dvorak keyboard layout...  \nPlease Note\nI know there is an on-screen keyboard included in GDM. Please don't post that as an answer, I am using the keyboard as an example and would like to know how to run any application in the GDM window. \n\nA: You need to add the program you would like to run to the gdm user's startup applications. As explained in the GDM documentation, this is done by adding .desktop files to the /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow directory.\nSpecifically, in your case, you need to create a file at /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow/onboard.desktop with the following contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Onboard\nComment=Onboard Keyboard\nExec=/usr/bin/onboard\n\nIf the onboard executable is not in /usr/bin, change the last line to point to the correct path.\n", "Q: Made an ubuntu live usb on a compromised system. How to make sure the usb isn't compromised and how to securely reinstall ubuntu I finally made an ubuntu live usb on a compromised ubuntu desktop laptop. Startup disk creator told me the usb was 7.2 gb, instead 7.8 gb and I believe the original hack involved my flash drive. Is there any way to make sure the usb isn't infected and is there any way of completely cleanly and securely reinstalling ubuntu to lock out the hacker?\nAlso my ubuntu 14.04 iso said it was made thursday but modified the monday before. Is it safe to trust it?\n\nA: You can run a checksum verification on an .iso image. However, you should not be burning the image to disk from an infected system. Create your bootable medium on a different machine or order a disk online. An additional concern is that a virus can also be written into a boot record, firmware compromised, etc. So once a machine is compromised, you can't really trust it to be able to clean itself.\nIt seemed worth adding that since you are interested in checking file integrity in an environment with LIKELY malicious tampering that the MD5 algorithm is no longer considered secure:\n\nThe underlying MD5 algorithm is no longer deemed secure, thus while\n  md5sum is well-suited for identifying known files in situations that\n  are not security related, it should not be relied on if there is a\n  chance that files have been purposefully and maliciously tampered. In\n  the latter case, the use of a newer hashing tool such as sha256sum is\n  highly recommended.  md5sum wiki article\n\n", "Q: Why is using the # symbol as a preface not a comment? < - - Linux Noob.

It was only when I upgraded the motherboard to UEFI that I was able to boot into the OS.\n\nA: The fact that only works randomly and under certain conditions indicates a hardware problem or that the bootloader (GRUB) sectors are damaged. I would recommend using a live cd to do a backup of all your important files and try to install again.

Pressing the \"e\" key at the GRUB menu will enable you to edit the options passed to the kernel. It's conceivable that adding or removing some options will prevent the reboot you're seeing, or at least show you some useful diagnostic messages. Removing quiet splash should do the latter, but I don't have any specific recommendations to actually fix the problem. (Those are likely to depend greatly on your particular hardware.)\n\n*Use a different boot loader. This will require replacing GRUB on your USB flash drive with something else, which is not a well-documented procedure, AFAIK. The best I can suggest is that you read my EFI Boot Loaders for Linux page (and particularly the first two sub-pages) to learn the principles and then apply them to your USB drive.\n\n*Fiddle with firmware settings. You can launch your firmware setup utility and start adjusting settings. I have nothing in particular in mind to change, but it's conceivable that some setting in there will improve matters.\n\n*Use a different distribution. You might simply have better luck with something other than Ubuntu 14.04. Maybe this is a 14.04-specific bug and 13.10 would work; or you might have to switch to something entirely different, like Fedora.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 not booting after error message. /temp could not be mounted (still need help) I am trying to change a GRUB2 boot entry and can not seem to edit or save the file after entering sudo vi /etc/grub.d/10_lupin into terminal.\nI am having the same problem as a few others with the way Ubuntu 14.04 boots and found instructions to fix the problem by changing this line: \nlinux   ${rel_dirname}/${basename} root=${LINUX_HOST_DEVICE} loop=${loop_file_relative} ro ${args}\n\nto this: \nlinux   ${rel_dirname}/${basename} root=${LINUX_HOST_DEVICE} loop=${loop_file_relative} rw ${args}\n\nPlease be patient with me, I don't know what the heck I'm doing.\n\nA: Try using this line in the Terminal:    sudo nano /etc/grub.d/10_lupin\nAs I'm not that familiar with using Vi to edit text, Nano was a little easier for me to edit. just press Ctrl+o to write the file Ctrl + x to exit when you're finish with it, and when you're back in the terminal, enter    sudo update-grub \n", "Q: Choppy Video Playback with Intel GMA-500 Chipset I've recently installed Xubuntu-14.04 on my VAIO-P netbook with Intel GMA-500 graphics chipset. I had several problems (as expected because of GMA-500/Poulsbo) and fortunately I was able to resolve most of them.\nThe last remaining problem to achieve an ideal experience is video playback quality: videos play choppy and laggy. I've tried several video players, including the default Parole, GNOME Videos (Totem) and VLC. The first two are the same and have choppy-laggy playbacks. VLC can do nothing and just hangs!\nI'm testing with medium quality (480p) MP4 videos, which should be able to play fine. In Windows-7, even HD (720p) videos can be somewhat played (though not very smooth) but there is no problem with 360p or even 480p videos.\nNote: I've been installing and using Ubuntu/Xubuntu on this machine since 10.10 and this is not a new problem with 14.04. In the past the problem was simply because there was no fine performing driver for GMA-500/Poulsbo graphics. But from 13.04 on-wards, many problems are gone or can be resolved easily, as I have done so myself.\nSo I was wondering if there is a solution for this?\n\nNote-2: I don't know if this is related information but I also had choppy audio playback (both for videos and audio files), and I was able to resolve it using the solution suggested here, which was adding tsched=0 to the following line in /etc/pulse/default.pa:\nload-module module-udev-detect\n\nThis solved the audio playback problem both for audio and video files. Now, the only remaining problem is the choppy video playback.\n\nUPDATE: Surprisingly, Totem is now playing videos fine! I don't know what caused it to work because I didn't work on the issue since yesterday and suddenly it's working today! Although Parole is still unable to play smoothly and it's exactly as before: choppy and laggy.\nI'll be using Totem (GNOME Videos) for now, but still I appreciate if anyone can help me understand what solved the problem on Totem, and how to solve it on Parole to.\n\nA: There used to be a ppa repo for the GMA500 drivers.\nhttps://launchpad.net/~gma500/+archive/ppa\nThey have not been updated in a while, but I made it to newer versions of Ubuntu (12.04 I think it is the latest I tried) with the one they offer there.\nAnother solution I took with a laptop that had that graphic card was EMGD drivers.

However, most program development rules will still apply when it comes to content, ad delivery(if you chose to) what stage you want to release the app to and where you want it targeted.  Because of the limited (yes smart phones still have a slight minority demographic) range your app will follow, do make it available to as many devices as possible.  Guide lines should be followed as a guide, but remember they are publishing your stuff so do not stray too far.  As far as DRM is considered, a touchy yet still nasty subject.

IMHO, this is the best option.\n\n\n*Whole desktop access\nYou can use a vnc client like vinegar.\nThere is also other protocols but some are really old (xdmcp), and other may be too young (nx).\n\nA: If you just want to mount your work filesystem and you can already ping it, then the easiest thing you can do is the following:\nOn your work computer (or the appropriate alternative if it's not running Ubuntu), run:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nNow, on your client machine, run:\nsudo apt-get install sshfs\n\nThen mount the remote filesystem with: \nsshfs $USER@$WORK_IP:/path/to/directory /path/to/local/mount\n\nYou will need to enter your work user's password to mount the filesystem, so make sure it is something secure.\nNFS is also an alternative but more advanced in my opinion, hence requires a tutorial.\n", "Q: Abbreviations in the Ubuntu Software Center The Ubuntu Software Center uses lots of abbreviations and words that I do not know, because I am not a programmer. Ninety-nine out of a hundred times when I look at information about a program with an interesting name I do not understand a word of what is written there. Is there a dictionary or a thesaurus somewhere where I can find these things?\n\nA: Visit the Ubuntu Glossary wiki. The Glossary of Terms in the Ubuntu Glossary wiki is meant to be an information resource and reference of commonly and uncommonly used terms, arranged alphabetically.\nThere are many other sources of information about decoding abbreviations and acronyms, etc. on the web, however the advantage of the Ubuntu Glossary wiki is that it is Ubuntu-specific.\n", "Q: Juju and no default VPC on AWS I'm trying to use Juju with AWS but when I bootstrap it says that it cannot set up groups: \"No default VPC for this user (VPCIdNotSpecified)\".\nI have no default VPC on AWS and it appears it's not trivial  to get it.  There's been some discussion about this but it doesn't look like it's resolved.\nDoes anyone know if it is possible to set the VPC in environments.yaml?\nThanks!\n\nA: This is not possible with juju at the moment, and there are no immediate plans to support custom VPC instead of the default VPC (at least not for the 14.10 release). Juju uses VPC-related AWS APIs now and will increase its reliance on VPC-based EC2 deployments.\nWhat I can advise you is to contact AWS support to restore your default VPC (in case you had one and deleted it) or perhaps sign-up for a new AWS account, as it should come with a default VPC.\nPlease, file a bug against juju-core as well, so we can keep track of this and have it  considered for future releases.

In the (admittedly dated) Ubuntu Live CD Customization guide, there is a bug involving initctl mentioned. I used the same approach to prevent invoke-rc.d from running, which the configuration of libpam-systemd uses. invoke-rc.d is a utility for starting and stopping initd scripts, which don't need to be running in the chroot:\ndpkg-divert --rename --add /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d\nln -s /bin/true /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d\n#Run apt-get, dpkg etc...\nrm /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d\ndpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d\n\nWith the diversion in place, invoke-rc.d always returns success and doesn't do anything, which is exactly the desired behaviour inside a chroot.\n\nA: is a well known bug: (see Bug #1325142 on Launchpad); I met this problem too while I was building my own Live in chroot and I solved it (if \"solved\" can be the right word ... let's create a new word, say \"workarounded\") this way:\nin chroot, after having finished installing everything, I've stated not to update libpam-systemd:\necho \"libpam-systemd  hold\"|dpkg --set-selections\n\nthen I've dist-upgraded my distro without (obviously) getting any error and finally I've built my live DVD.\nTo test if my workaround was good, I've installed trusty on a VM from that iso, logged in and from shell I've revoked the directive on iso about not to upgrade libpam-systemd:\nsudo -i\necho \"libpam-systemd install\"|dpkg --set-selecions\n\nand finally I've dist-upgraded again the brand new system: no errors.\nI think it's a problem happening just in chroot environment.\nCheers,\nSilvia\n", "Q: Cinnamon being a complete mess on Ubuntu After installing Cinnamon the desktop icons on cinnmaon have black text where i want white and the windows are appearing as follows:\nAnd for the desktop, it is appearing like this,\n\nHow do i remove the big black things in windows and change icon the icon text color?\n\nA: I found an answer finally!

PhotoRec can recover files of most types, including most picture and video formats. PhotoRec can be used on existing partitions, or can be used to recover files on deleted partitions without having to recover the underlying partitions.\nPossible setups for recovery include:\nRecover the files to a separate hard drive.\nRecover the files to a networked storage drive.\nRecover the files to a separate partition on the same hard drive.\nImage the hard drive using a tool like ddrescue and recover files using only one partition.\n\nDownload them here, both tools are in the same package.\nInstall the package and try your luck, I hope you can recover your lost files.\nReference\n\nA: If you run cp -r /tmp /home command with superuser privileges(sudo), your /tmp directory must be inside /home directory (/home/tmp).

If we enable encryption via cryptsetup tool on linux. Where does it keeps the crypt list/ encryption disk sector information etc ? Is it resides inside the LUKS header or device mapper kernel itself would takes care all of those information?\nThanks for your reply.\n~\nAbhrajyoti\n\nA: During the initial setup cryptsetup luksFormat, some information, including the auto-generated master key of your encrypted volume, and various other information on what type of encryption is used, is stored in the LUKS header on your encrypted partition. This information can be viewed using \ncryptsetup luksDump $blockdev. \nThis is persistent, as it is stored as part of the encrypted volume.\nWhen you decrypt an encrypted LUKS volume cryptsetup luksOpen, your passphrase or keyfile is used to unlock one of the 8 key slots present in the header to get to your master key. A device mapper virtual block device is created referencing the encrypted block device, with the master key and other encryption details gotten from the LUKS header. \nThis typically looks like /dev/mapper/decryptedvolumename. \nA device-mapper block device is ephemeral -- it only lasts as long as you don't shut down the machine, very much like a typical mount.\n", "Q: 12.04 No new release found for upgrade when i log into my server, I see the following message\nWelcome to Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 2.6.38-15-generic x86_64)\n\n * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/\n\n0 packages can be updated.\n0 updates are security updates.\n\nNew release '12.10' available.\nRun 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.\n\nBut then when I run sudo do-release-upgrade i get this message:\nChecking for a new Ubuntu release\nNo new release found\n\nDoesn't that seem kinda silly?

If I recall correctly Ctrl+super+d doesn't redraw desktop; it just minimizes everything.  \nAlso, you can try disabling window effects.  To do this, install compizconfig-settings-manager and find the option to do so there.\n\nIf that doesn't work, 12.04 should have a 2d unity mode that you should try.  \nLet us know what happens with each of these and we can go from there. \n\nA: As lbaile200 says you must try installing CompizConfig settings manager and disabling window effects. \nBut I am guessing that this might have something to do with system cache. You might try clearing it off with Ubuntu Tweak's 'Janitor' feature. Install Ubuntu tweak with these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak  \n\nThen open it from dash or with the terminal command:\nubuntu-tweak\n\nIt will show up like this and you need to select Start Janitor(as seen below):\n\n(I am using numix circle icon theme and so it may look different for you according to your theme)\nNow in the Janitor select whichever kind of cache you want to remove and then select Clean. This should remove unwanted cache from your computer. Now see if your problem persists.\nAlso you can try resetting unity to its defaults. Refer to this answer.\nPS :- For those of you who are wondering why cache clearing would solve graphical glitches see here. The OP there says its clearing cache that solved their issue. \n\nA: I'm observing the same issue, on 15.04, \nso as this person here\nThe problem is that when minimizing the last window, the animation just hangs and unity freezes. The mouse is still active but whatever I click nothing happens. The only way to get out of it is to press Alt+Tab, select the descktop and this unlocks unity. \nThis problem is not linked with the king of animation that I choose for the windows minimizing. I have selected different animations and even tried to completely dissable them without removing the problem. The only way to get red of it is to enable the desktop icons. I get this problem only if I disable all desktop icons.\nFred\n\nA: This could be related to a bug that occurs with desktop icon viewability set to off (can be enabled/disabled with a tool like ubuntu tweak, or the above mentioned ccsm program). If you change this setting to hide desktop icons from view in the desktop, you might get this lockup-on-minimize behavior.\n\nA: I also arrived here for the same problem and many a times it has been reported in \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1171451\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1170483\nSome users faced this problems often and said that resetting unity is solving it.\nhellrazor@hellrazor-desktop:~$ unity --reset\nThe --reset option is deprecated, You should run with no options instead.\nunity-panel-service stop/waiting\nunity7 stop/waiting\nunity-panel-service start/running, process 11984\nunity7 start/running, process 12072\n\nNow I am able to minimize my last windows and no problem is occuring .\n", "Q: Install native-bzip2 on Ubuntu 14.04 I have recently tried to build Hadoop 2.4 to use it's native libraries. \nAnd when I check that if hadoop is really using it.

When on my company network, I would manually go up and switch to the 'Work' setting (which would have the IP address, DNS settings..). However, on ubuntu 14.04, the network manager applet only displays the wireless and vpn settings and not the Ethernet settings. I have not found another way to switch the network. Ideas?\n\nA: This has bothered me too, and I have not found a workaround that doesn't involve installing an additional application.  In my case, I decided on wicd, which is a single manager for both wired and wireless configurations.  It's worked pretty well for me in solving the problem you describe.\n\nA: Network Connections -> Add -> Ethernet -> Create -> Fill all desired fields -> Save \nNow you have second (apart from default) connection and while wired connection is present you can switch between them with default network widget.\n\n", "Q: How do I set up a local SOCKS proxy that tunnels traffic through SSH? Assume I have access to an SSH server that supports tunneling, and I am on a PC that is running *ubuntu, how do I set up a local SOCKS proxy that tunnels the traffic through that SSH server before reaching the Internet?\n\nA: The ssh binary that you use when you connect to a server running ssh supports running a SOCKS proxy out of the box, with the -D flag. Example:\nssh -D 1337 -f -C -q -N user@remote -p 22\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-D 1337 tells ssh to launch a SOCKS server on port 1337 locally.\n\n*-f forks the process into the background.\n\n*-C Turns on compression.\n\n*-q enables \"Quiet mode\", since the purpose here is only to tunnel we don't really care about error output and such.\n\n*-N tells ssh that no commands will be sent (-f complains if we don’t specify this).\n\n*-p specifies what port to use; obviously this is defaulted to 22 so the statement above is pointless, but included for clarity.\n\n\nWhen your SOCKS server is up and running, you simply need to make sure that your application (usually a web browser) is trying to connect to the local SOCKS proxy, and not the regular Internet.\nIn Firefox 29 (explained here as an example), this is achieved by going to the menu (the three sausages in the top right), followed by Preferences > Advanced > Network > (Connection) > Settings... - make sure you only fill out the SOCKS field! Since your proxy is on the same system, you can use localhost or 127.0.0.1 to point back at whatever port you set it to on the same system.\nIf you need your DNS requests to be tunneled as well (if they are not, your DNS lookups will reveal what websites you are trying to visit), you can just check on \"Remote DNS\" or as well do this entire configuration in about:config. In the last case, open it up and set these values:\nnetwork.proxy.socks : 127.0.0.1\nnetwork.proxy.socks_port : 1337\nnetwork.proxy.socks.remote_dns : true\nnetwork.proxy.socks_version : 5\nnetwork.proxy.type : 1\n\nYou may also need this setting to exclude certain domains or sites from tunneling:\nnetwork.proxy.no_proxies_on : localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.0.0/24, .yourcompany.com\n\nThis answer was written from France, but tunneled via Sweden :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu & Mac OSX (install Ubuntu Touch to tablet, from Mac platform) I know this has probably been asked many times over but here goes: I have a MacBook Pro 15\" and an Nexus 7 (2013) tablet.\nI want to install Ubuntu (Touch) onto the Nexus but I don't have Ubuntu on my Mac.

Yes, I'm asking a lot especially as I have no experience with Ubuntu and hacking. Can you help please?\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu on an external HDD by going into the install, selecting \"Something Else\" choosing /dev/sdb or whatever your HDD is mounted as in the drop down menu, making one big partition as EXT4 , then choosing \"/\" in the mount point drop down menu.

In Synaptic, one can list packages by section. For example, in the image below all packages of the \"Amateur Radio (universe)\" section are listed.\nHow can I get such a list (edit: with package description) at the command line?\nI need a raw list; a terminal application like aptitude will not do.\n\n\nA: Well, though you say you don't want to use aptitude because of the output, you need to know that you can modify it to get what you like:\naptitude -F'|%p|%d|' search '?section(hamradio)'\n\nThe trick is in the -F switch that modifies the output format. %p means package. This also outputs when package has various architectures (ie amd64 vs i386), and %d which outputs the description. You can personalize the search pattern even more to for example not installed packages:\naptitude -F'|%p|%d|' search '?section(hamradio) !~i'\n\nwhere ~i means installed and the ! is a not, so it reads as \"not (!) installed (~i)\", or if you only want the ones that are available to your architecture:\naptitude -F'|%p|%d|' search '?section(hamradio) ~r native'\n\n~r being ?architecture() which matches the architecture of the package and native which lists only the ones that have the same architecture as the system, the equivalent to dpkg --print-architecture.\nThe previous line can therefore be written even more concisely as:\naptitude -F'|%p|%d|' search '~s hamradio ~r native'\n\n\nA: More fields on a single line, with arbitrary separator\nThe following one-liner will print all unique package names of a repository section, together with their description, each on a single line. All fields are separated by a pipe character, i.e. ready for conversion into a Markdown pipe table. The resulting table can be found on my web site.\ngrep-aptavail -n -s Package,Description -F Section hamradio |paste -sd '||\\n' |sed 's:^:|:' |sort -u\n\n\nA: You can use the following command to get a list of packages belonging to a given Section:\n$ dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package} ${Section}\\n' | awk '{if ($2 == \"shells\") {print $1}}'\nbash\nbash-completion\nbusybox-initramfs\nbusybox-static\ndash\nzsh\nzsh-common\n\n\nA: Make sure the dctrl-tools package is installed. It provides useful commands for searching the apt and dpkg package lists. To get a full description of all packages from a particular section that are installable with apt, run\ngrep-aptavail -F Section hamradio\n\nThis will show the full package metadata for every package in the hamradio section. If all you want to see are the package names, run\ngrep-aptavail -n -F Section -s Package hamradio\n\nIf your system is set up for multiarch, the same package may show up more than once in this listing if it is built for more than one architecture. So to refine this further, use either\ngrep-aptavail -n -F Section -s Package hamradio | sort | uniq\n\nor\ngrep-aptavail -n -F Section -s Package hamradio | sort -u\n\nto sort the package list and remove duplicate packages with the same name.\nNote that you will have to use the actual name of the section, which is different from the \"human-readable\" name that Synaptic shows in its GUI. For example, the searches above use the section name hamradio instead of the string \"Amateur Radio\" shown in Synaptic.\nSee the man page for grep-aptavail for a full description of all options and some examples.\n", "Q: Why \"./\" is used to run \".sh\" scripts in Unix? I am executing a .sh script today.\nIt is executed with prefix \"./.sh,I am a bit confuse because it is also executed without ./.but why this is required to use ./\nCould you please explain me that why ./ is used to run .sh scripts?\n\nA: The ./ is needed to tell bash interpreter where the script is located. There is a fixed set of directories that bash interpreter will check to run a command. \nIf your script is not in one of these directories than it will not find you script unless you specify the path. The ./ is telling the bash interpreter that the script is in the current directory. \nYou could also run the script from any other directory by using the full path.\ne.g. ./script.sh from within /path/to is the same as running /path/to/script.sh from anywhere if the script is located in /path/to.\nYou can run echo $PATH to get a list of all the directories the bash interpreter will check. If you move you script or place a symbolic link in one the directories you will be able to execute it just using the file name script.\n\nA: Using \"./\", means that you ask your file to be runned. But, your file has to be executable, else it will not work.\nIf your file is not executable, you will have to prefix your command with the program intended to run it. For your sh script, it will probably be : \"/bin/sh myscript.sh\" .\n", "Q: juju deployment error on manually provisioned machine I am getting the following error, when I try to deploy a service on a manually provisioned machine using juju:\njuju deploy juju-gui --show-log\n2014-05-20 13:42:31 INFO juju.cmd supercommand.go:302 running juju-1.18.3-unknown-amd64 [gc]\n2014-05-20 13:42:31 INFO juju api.go:242 connecting to API addresses [j93716.servers.jiffybox.net:17070]\n2014-05-20 13:42:31 INFO juju apiclient.go:114 state/api: dialing \"wss://xxx.xxx.net:17070/\"\n2014-05-20 13:42:31 INFO juju apiclient.go:124 state/api: connection established\nAdded charm \"cs:trusty/juju-gui-2\" to the environment.\n2014-05-20 13:42:46 ERROR juju.cmd supercommand.go:305 cannot assign unit \"juju-gui/0\" to machine: cannot assign unit \"juju-gui/0\" to new machine or container: cannot assign unit \"juju-gui/0\" to new machine: use \"juju add-machine ssh:[user@]<host>\" to provision machines\n\njuju status outputs the following:\nenvironment: manual\nmachines:\n  \"0\":\n    agent-state: started\n    agent-version: 1.18.3\n    dns-name: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n    instance-id: 'manual:'\n    series: precise\n    hardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=1 mem=1996M\n  \"1\":\n    agent-state: started\n    agent-version: 1.18.3\n    dns-name: xxx.xxx.xxx.yyy\n    instance-id: manual:xxx.xxx.xxx.net\n    series: precise\n    hardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=1 mem=1996M\nservices:\n  juju-gui:\n    charm: cs:trusty/juju-gui-2\n    exposed: true\n    units:\n      juju-gui/0:\n        agent-state: pending\n\nDid I miss something?\n\nA: Judging by the juju status output, you've bootstrapped a manual environment (using juju bootstrap, which is different from manual provisioning, done using juju add-machine ssh:[user@]host).\nManual environments are special - they consist only of a single machine and it cannot start or stop additional machines automatically, including on juju deploy. To add another machine, use juju add-machine ssh:[user@]host first, then juju deploy juju-gui --to #, where # is the juju machine id of the machine you've just added (run juju status to see it). You can also use juju deploy juju-gui --to 0 to deploy Juju GUI on the bootstrap machine.\njuju add-machine ssh:[user@]host can be used in any bootstrapped environment to manually provision an external machine and add it to the environment. But with a manually bootstrapped environment, that's the only way to add machines, and you have to specify placement for services and units when deploying, with --to <machine-id> explicitly.\nI hope that clears up any confusion. We definitely need better documentation on that I suppose.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Server on Barracuda Backup Server 490 I am fairly new to Ubuntu and Linux in general.

I was wondering if there was any way I could install Ubuntu Server on the server and use it again for my own use? Any help is appreciated. Thank you.\n\nA: We aren't specialists on Barracuda Networks legal policy AFAIK, since your question may have a legal component you should begin by reading this and perhaps contact the company directly here\nAs far as installation procedures are concerned that topic has been covered extensively in this document. \n\nA: I work for Barracuda and can honestly say this will not be easy. The only way to do so would have to be hard-hacking it. You would need to open the sucker up and locate the GPIO ports. There may be some kinds of terminal interface, JTAG, SPI, UART, I have no idea... MAYBE you could do this. You could try SSH'ing into it but you would need to spoof Barracuda's IP since it's the only address allowed to SSH into the unit. I know the IP now is 64.235.147.75 but if it is old it may be different. I would have to say these proprietary systems are made to need support from a Barracuda Technical Support Representative.\n", "Q: Preseed Ubuntu installation with full disk encryption I am trying to set up Ubuntu full disk encryption using preseeding. I was able to set things up correctly following the preseed file presented here. But I do not want to provide the default password in the preseed file.

The answer clearly has to do with the ssh made to localhost, but why does this ssh grant these permissions?\nAfter that I get what happens, once both files are modified then the user toor has root permissions and is summoned with the su command. My main problem is understanding with ssh -o 'NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes' -i \"$KEY\" localhost true lets you gain write permissions on both the shadow and the passwd.\n\nA: This was a bug in pam_motd that has long since been patched out:\n\npam_motd (aka the MOTD module) in libpam-modules before 1.1.0-2ubuntu1.1 in PAM on Ubuntu 9.10 and libpam-modules before 1.1.1-2ubuntu5 in PAM on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS allows local users to change the ownership of arbitrary files via a symlink attack on .cache in a user's home directory, related to \"user file stamps\" and the motd.legal-notice file.\n\nThis basically translates to, while logging in with SSH, PAM (the authentication module, running as root) would try to chown $USER: ~/.cache. It didn't look to see what that was so the ownership change was propagating to the linked file.\nThat allowed you to own and then edit the system files and gain root-level access.\nWhile .cache was symlinked to /etc/{passwd,shadow} they could have echoed into .cache... But why bother? By that point those files had their file ownership changed to $USER. They were freely editable.\nJust in answer to your comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't give you permission, it (or I should say its PAM module) is the thing changing the ownership. But yes, PAM doing what it did was the problem.\n\n*The symlink to ~/.cache is just a redirect for the exploit. Is required so that when you log in PAM (running as root) tries to chown the linked file. That's the exploit there.\n\n*It was an oversight and it was fixed by dropping privileges before entering into any of that code.\n", "Q: Setting up MAAS on 14.04LTS Region + Cluster on same server DHCP not working First time trying out MAAS (want Openstack dev/test under cloud setup using MAAS). I want lab net <-> (eth0) MAAS Region & Cluster server  (eth1) [DHCP/DNS] <-> isolated net.  I installed via 14.04 LTS installer selected MAAS and after a couple hiccups I believe I have things mostly working (UI available) but I can't get DHCP on the isolated network.  One thing that troubles me is that I cannot ping the eth1 address of the cluster server.  I would appreciate troubleshooting tips for maas in general, things to look for in logs etc.  From the Cluster system I can ping it's own eth1 address but am getting Destination Host Unreachable for others on the (eth1) 192.0.2.0 network.     \n#cat /etc/network/interfaces\n...\n# The primary network interface\n# This is an autoconfigured IPv6 interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n#iface eth0 inet6 auto\naddress 10.80.xxx.50\nnetmask 255.255.254.0\nnetwork 10.80.xxx.0\nbroadcast 10.80.xxx.255\ngateway 10.80.xxx.1\n# dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed\ndns-nameservers xxx.xxx.xx.132 xxx.xx.xxx.52 xxx.xx.xxx.41\ndns-search xxx.com\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.0.2.10\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nup ip route add 192.0.2.0/24 via 192.0.2.1 || true   \n\n# ip addr\n3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000\nlink/ether 00:1e:68:9b:2f:6c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\ninet 192.0.2.10/24 brd 192.0.2.255 scope global eth1\n   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\ninet6 fe80::21e:68ff:fe9b:2f6c/64 scope link\n   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n\n#ip route\ndefault via 10.80.208.1 dev eth0\n10.80.208.0/23 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.80.208.50\n192.0.2.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.0.2.10\n\n\nA: This stumped me for a bit since it sure looked like eth1 wasn't connected into the right network but I saw all the cables connected.  The answer is that I actually hadn't screwed up my network/route setup but that I didn't realize that the udev rules for NIC mapping was different from what I had assumed it actually was.  My server's NetMgmt port is actually shares a physical connector between Service Processor and Server.

But as I understand it is common problem.\nHere is a links:\nVery helpful topic\nCPU utilization problem\nGradle performance \nGoogle\nWhat you can do is change process scheduling. For process that runs IDE or gradle.\nnice\n\nnice is a program found on Unix and Unix-like operating systems such\n  as Linux. It directly maps to a kernel call of the same name. nice is\n  used to invoke a utility or shell script with a particular priority,\n  thus giving the process more or less CPU time than other processes. A\n  niceness of −20 is the highest priority and 19 or 20 is the lowest\n  priority. The default niceness for processes is inherited from its\n  parent process, usually 0.\n\nTo change niceness you can use renice command\nsudo renice <PID> <niceness> \n\nRead this for more information\nFor building time you can set niceness for 15-20. After build change it to default value, usually it is 0.\ncpulimit\nInstall cpulimit. sudo apt-get install cpulimit\n-p : Process PID.\n-e : Process name.\n-l : percentage of CPU allowed from 0 to 100.\n-P: absolute path name of the executable program file.\n\nTo limit CPU usage of the process called firefox to 30%, enter:\n# cpulimit -e firefox -l 30\n\nTo limit CPU usage of the process to 30% by using its PID, enter:\n# cpulimit -p 1313 -l 30\n\n\ncpulimit should run at least with the same user running the controlled\n  process. But it is much better if you run cpulimit as root, in order\n  to have a higher priority and a more precise control.\nIf your machine has one processor you can limit the percentage from 0%\n  to 100%, which means that if you set for example 50%, your process\n  cannot use more than 500 ms of cpu time for each second. But if your\n  machine has four processors, percentage may vary from 0% to 400%, so\n  setting the limit to 200% means to use no more than half of the\n  available power. In any case, the percentage is the same of what you\n  see when you run top.\n\nCpulimit usage\nHow to limit CPU usage\nchrt\nYou also can change process scheduler or PID.\nSCHED_FIFO\nScheduling policy designed for special time-critical applications. It uses the First In-First Out scheduling algorithm.\n\nSCHED_BATCH\nScheduling policy designed for CPU-intensive tasks.\n\nSCHED_IDLE\nScheduling policy intended for very low prioritized tasks.\n\nSCHED_OTHER\nDefault Linux time-sharing scheduling policy used by the majority of processes.\n\nSCHED_RR\nSimilar to SCHED_FIFO, but uses the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.\n\nMost if process in Ubuntu are SCHED_OTHER\nFind priority values for scheduling policy\n$ chrt -m\nSCHED_OTHER min/max priority    : 0/0\nSCHED_FIFO min/max priority : 1/99\nSCHED_RR min/max priority   : 1/99\nSCHED_BATCH min/max priority    : 0/0\nSCHED_IDLE min/max priority : 0/0\n\nSet SCHED_IDLE to process\n$ chrt -i -p 0 PID\n\nor you can change priority SCHED_OTHER\n$ chrt -o -p 1 PID\n\nHowto\nAnother way\nAlso you can try to reduce number of Thread for gradle.

Lookup 'man ifconfig'; network type usually should be eth0 (wired ethernet) or wlan0 (wireless); since this is a server we are talking about, eth0 is the safer bet.\nFor ssh access to the server it needs to be running an ssh daemon.

I was preparing an un-allocated partition of 25 GB from Windows to Ubuntu.\nIn the installation of Ubuntu I did not find the option of \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8\", so I've chosen \"something else\" & selected sda then clicked new partition table, created a swap area around 4GB. Finally the rest partitioned as root for the system with size of 20GB.\nOnce  the installation finished; neither can I boot into Windows nor find my NTFS partitions (C, D, E).\n\n\n\nA: You should have zapped the GPT data before if you could not find the windows partitions. Now, of you are able to boot into Ubuntu, installed gparted and check if the windows partition has boot marked on it.\n\nA: \nWe are very sorry to inform you that your Windows partition has died after a violent purge from the Ubuntu installer.\n\n\nAs you can see in the output of fdisk -l /dev/sda, only two partitons are detected :\n\n\n*\n\n*A Linux partition with a boot flag, probably your / filesystem.\n\n*An extended partition, which actually is a swap.\n\n\nAccording to gparted, the rest is unallocated disk space, meaning it has no filesystem, no partitionning scheme, nothing. This is quite like a no man's land.\nIt is very likely that pieces of your (naturally) fragmented Windows data is spread all over the disk, including in the unallocated space. However, without a proper partitionning scheme and a filesystem, this data is meaning-less and inaccessible. Re-formating the space might cause another loss of data.\nSadly, the comment from Rod Smith is true : everything got messed up. You might be able to recover a few things, but that's it.

Now I can't boot into installed Ubuntu. I tried to install Ubuntu on another partition, it succeed. But after rebooting, it automatically boots into USB installation, can not read installed systems. At the boot menu, I can't select booting OS as 1st boot option, or 2nd! It always boots into USB and if USB is not plugged in, it  shows errors and doesn't open anything. My computer is Asus.

I will need to go back and take a look, but gparted, grub and bootrepair should provide the arsenal to fix this.\nI think Boot Repair may be what you  are looking for. I remember I needed this to recover from a similar problem...  \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair \nm2k1981's answer is also the best first step to take....\nOther: Boot into the USB and run gparted (if not on the distro then get to terminal and run sudo \napt-get install gparted to take a look at what is going on but note: Editing partitions has the potential to cause LOSS of DATA.  \n\nA: After press power button to start computer press F2 or delete button to go to BIOS and change BOOTING SEQUENCE. Generally you can find booting sequence under Advance or Boot tab. Make HDD first booting device where you have installed your os. Save and exit. And BOOT MENU list of option shown after F12 is press instead of F2 or delete. Post whatever happens.\n\nA: After you successfully installed your Ubuntu you needed to unplug the USB because your bios automatically will boot to your USB installation if your USB is still connected. \nBoot-repair can help you with your grub which is the boot menu your missing. \nYou can use your USB and use \"try it before installing\" it option and try to install the boot-repair from there.\nAlso if all fails try to reinstall ubuntu but make sure your selecting the options mount point to / root.\n", "Q: Increase text size in list display In List display text size is much smaller than icon size.

I'm not exactly sure how to put it to words, but it's noticeably worse than it was on Windows 8.1. In fact, it was very much above average on Windows.

I don't think this is possible with current versions of terminal unless you use a find function.\nHowever as an alternative, you can colour in the prompts so that it is easier to work out where they are:\n\nYou can do this in Ubuntu* by going to the ~/.bashrc file, and uncommenting this line:\n#force_color_prompt=yes\n\nto:\nforce_color_prompt=yes\n\nYou can then save it and run source ~/.bashrc and see the changes straight away.\n*In other Linux OS's, on versions of Ubuntu without this version of ~/.bashrc, just copy lines 31 to 78 (only most of it is needed) of this and then uncomment #force_color_prompt...\n\nA: There isn't one as far as I know. You have a few choices though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pipe the output through less or more\ncommand | less\n\n\n*Hit the up until you find the command you ran and run it again (optionally using less or more again).\n\n*Run the previous command through less using history expansion.\n!! | less\n\n\n*Use a terminal that supports searching through the scroll back. The image below is showing my preferred terminal, terminator (installable with sudo apt-get terminator) but Ubuntu's default terminal also supports this. Just hit Ctrl Shift F to show the search bar. If you then search for either the command's name or your username (which appears in your prompt) you will be taken directly back to the last command:\n\n\nA: If you're using gnome-terminal, what you can do is just copy the content of the terminal to a text file using \"Edit->Select All\" and \"Edit->Copy\".\nNote: It will work only if you have set an unlimited scrollback.\nNow open the text file in your favourite editor and find the previous occurrence of your shell prompt.\nIt's often easier to perform lookup operations in a text editor (amongst other things).  \n\nA: What about using a new terminal for every command? In gnome Terminal Ctrl+Shift+T Spawns a terminal in a new tab at the current directory.\n\nA: If you can use Emacs, its shell mode keeps an infinite log of your input and output, which you can scroll back and forth through. It has a command ctrl-meta-L, or escctrl-L, which will usually jump back to the start of the output that follows the most recent line of input that you typed.\n", "Q: citrix receiver for 14.04 lts I am trying install icaclient-modified.deb and getting error.\nWorkstation@home:~/Downloads$ dpkg -b ica_temp icaclient-modified.deb\ndpkg-deb: building package `icaclient' in `icaclient-modified.deb'.\nWorkstation@home:~/Downloads$ sudo dpkg -i icaclient-modified.deb\n(Reading database ... 238986 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack icaclient-modified.deb ...\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\nUnpacking icaclient (12.1.0) over (12.1.0) ...\nSetting up icaclient (12.1.0) ...\ndpkg: error processing package icaclient (--install):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 2\nProcessing triggers for menu (2.1.46ubuntu1) ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n icaclient\nWorkstation@home:~/Downloads$ \n\n\nA: I found a work around\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2221765\nIt works fine but it is not integrated to the browser.\nIf you can download the ica launcher file (usually launch.ica) you can run with\n./wifca.sh /path/to/launcher/launch.ica\n\nYou should run this in the folder where you have installed your ICAClient (in the link $home/ICAClient/linuxx86)\n", "Q: Juju bootstraping gomaasapi timestamp error Have a simple setup consisting of one LTS 14.04 MAAS server, responsible for dhcp and dns, and a laptop target node.

In fact, most of the time it just mean tar Downloads/df_*_linux.tar.bz2 if you downloaded DF with a browser. The other problem is due missing libraries. Since version 0.43.05, you can get 64-bits builds and watching that the default Ubuntu image offered to users is the 64-bits, this should not offer more complications than necessary.\nThe required libraries can be listed, after you extracted the tar file, with a simple ldd df_linux/libs/Dwarf_Fortress, and passing the library path to dpkg -S which would list the packages.

Is it a char or a number? You need to specify this like, data int primary key or data2 char(40) not null. On int's you don't need to specify the length of the variable but on chars you do. \n\nA: There is an error with your query to database - you cant place , before ).\nHowever INSERT values should be placed between ', like 'value'. It's unnecessary, but it's good practice.\nYou can \"generate\" your query by adding some implode functions, like this:\n$data = array(\"name\" => $_POST[\"name\"]);\n$into = implode(\", \", array_keys($data));\n$values = \"'\".implode(\"', '\", $data).\"'\";\n$query = \"INSERT INTO user ($into) VALUES ($values);\");\n\nGenerating queries should help you omit future syntax errors.\n", "Q: Can't Deploy Wordpress with juju Successfully deployed mysql on machine 0, and forced deployment of wordpress on the same machine, i.e., juju deploy --to 0 -repository:/xxxx local:trusty:/wordpress. juju status shows installation failure:\nwordpress/0:\n    agent-state: error\n    agent-state-info: 'hook failed: \"install\"'\n    agent-version: 1.18.3.1\n    machine: \"0\"\n    public-address: node1.maas\n\nLooking in /var/log/juju/unit-mysql-0.log, noted the following:\n...\n2014-05-20 20:39:42 INFO juju.worker.uniter modes.go:65 found queued \"install\" hook\n2014-05-20 20:39:42 INFO juju.worker.uniter uniter.go:480 running \"install\" hook\n2014-05-20 20:39:42 INFO install + add-apt-repository ppa:charmers/charm-helpers\n2014-05-20 20:39:47 DEBUG juju.worker.uniter.filter filter.go:317 got unit change\n2014-05-20 20:43:58 INFO install Cannot add PPA: 'ppa:charmers/charm-helpers'.\n2014-05-20 20:43:58 INFO install Please check that the PPA name or format is correct.\n2014-05-20 20:43:58 ERROR juju.worker.uniter uniter.go:486 hook failed: exit status 1\n2014-05-20 20:43:58 DEBUG juju.worker.uniter modes.go:384 ModeContinue exiting\n...\n\nTarget node is a single nic machine, connected to the local maas network, and seems that it is not able to access ppa:charmers/charm-helpers.

I have updated one and would like to use the cached packages of this to update the other one. I cannot find a way. I did Ctrl+A then Enter but machine hangs badly. How to do the update without creating problems? \n\nA: This tutorial assumes you have access to another Ubuntu machine that is online, and Synaptic Package Manager is installed on both machines.\nOpen a terminal with Control+Alt+t and type\nsynaptic\n\nThis will open the Synaptic Package Manager if synaptic is not installed then run this command.\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nYou can browse available software in the column on the far left, or if you know specifically what you're looking for, type it into the search box.\nWhen you find the software you want to install, right click it and select \"Mark for Installation\". If a dialog comes up \"Mark Additional Required Changes\" select Mark. This will ensure that all the packages required for the selected software get installed as well.\nOnce you've picked your software, go to File>Generate Package Download Script. Save the script to a USB flash drive or some other portable media. You can name the script whatever you want, but for clarity we'll assume you named it \"download\".\nThe Package Download Script is just a little text file (with a .sh extension) that will tell your online computer which packages to download, so you can transfer them to the offline computer.\nTake the flash drive to your online computer. Create a new folder called \"packages\" in the home folder to hold the downloaded packages, and copy the script to that folder.\nOpen up a terminal on the online computer using Control+Alt+t, and type\ncd package\n\nNow type\nchmod +x download.sh\n\nAnd finally\n./download.sh\n\nThis will download the packages to the folder containing the script. If you open the package in a file manager you'll see one or more files with the extension .deb. These are the software package files. \nCopy the \"packages\" folder containing the .deb files to the flash drive and onto the /home folder of the offline computer.\nOpen up a terminal on the offline computer and type\nsudo dpkg -iR packages\n\nYou'll be prompted for your administrator password, which will be the same as your user login password. Enter it and Ubuntu will install your software!\nTutorial by cortman is here: offline package install \nAlso:\nOffline Synaptic Installation/Repository Updates \noffline repository updates\n\nA: You can use Cube App Share. It can share/transfer your installed applications from your computer to another computer without downloading any packages.\nJust make sure that your computer and the other computer have same distribution and version (ie.

I then do the same thing with the next folder, and the next folder, et cetera, until I'm able to auto-complete the the file at the end of the path. It's a lot quicker than typing the path manually, and it's far less likely to result in errors. \nHonestly, I don't know how CLI users used to get along without tab-completion.\n\nA: Please check the spelling and case of the file/directory path your are trying to copy. This is most likely due to a mistyped file/directory path. Remember that Linux is case-sensitive, and if you have any spaces in a file/directory names you must put the path in quotes:\nsudo cp -R \"/home/username/some folder name/\"\n\n\nA: Try to type in the shell \nls -l /var/lib/iHRIS/lib/4.1.9/ihris-manage/sites/blank\n\nit would probably say that the file does not exist.

I heard something about the disk split (partitioning) or something. All I want to know is what happens with my 1TB hard drive. Will my documents still be there?\n\nA: So, there are several ways:\nIf you have already installed Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Wubi .\nIt's installing as usually Windows program. Bad choice - performance is low.\n\n*Split your had disk\nAutomatically:\nWrite your .iso on a CD/DVD disk and load system from it.\nThere are also 2 options: \nLoads as LiveCD (It called \"Try Ubuntu\") or directly install. Ubuntu can automatically shrink Windows in both of case.

More details here or here. You goal is create \"Unallocated\" space.\nIt operation keep all your files.\nThen simply install Ubuntu from disk on unallocated HDD space.\nIf Windows not installed:\nInstall Windows and only after it go to \"If you have already installed Windows\"\n\nIf you're so afraid, you can buy a new hard disk and install Ubuntu on it.\n\nA: Hi & Welcome to AskUbuntu,\nTo give you a basic understanding both Windows and Linux are Operating systems but it has its own core, functionality and user friendliness. Ubuntu provided Wubi (a utility which you can install the Ubuntu system inside Windows without making any changes), considering about certain users who didn't want themselves to mess with the current system set-up they have. Unfortunately support for Wubi has ended with upcoming releases. You may refer \"What's the difference between Wubi and a regular installation?\" for more understanding\nPortioning (splitting) is required since you'll be installing Ubuntu alongside Windows. That means you're installing it on an existing portion (the space you've created) of the drive but not the drive where Windows lies. Therefore, you'll not loose any files in this way.\n\nImportant Note: By installing Ubuntu, its GRUB bootloader itself\n  will act as the default boot by listing Windows as one. This will not\n  make any harm as you can recover Windows loader at anytime. Further,\n  make sure you're not messing up with your Windows recovery, system\n  restore partitions.. etc. Refer \"How to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on?\" in case if you want to move to Windows completely and boot through its bootloader.\n\nHaving said that, Below seen are some interesting and useful articles to begin your installation journey with.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I install Ubuntu without removing Windows? - This explains a 11.10 installation but its pretty much the same though there'll be minor modification on the process.\n\n\nHope it helps! :)\n\nA: yes your hard disk will split into partition. You can access windows drive in Ubuntu but you will not be able to use UBUNTU drive in window.\nWhile installation you need to select one partition to store your Ubuntu OS at that time you can select your any empty drive and install in it. The drive which you will use for Ubuntu will not visible in windows explorer. But if you want to access that drive one third party software is there(Google it), using that software you can use that drive. I hope this texts will remove your confusion.\n", "Q: Linux partition system While installing Ubuntu, I only created two partitions for Ubuntu one for swap and I formatted the other as ext4 and set mount point as \"/\".

Is there a performance difference between the two methods?\n\nA: There is a difference not so much for performance but for the easier administration.\nThe layout I usually use for partitioning is:\n/\n/var\n/home\n/tmp\nswap partition.\n\nI setup /var and /tmp on different mount points in order to keep the root filesystem / clean because /var can get filled by downloaded updates and /tmp can get filled with temporary files and thus causing the system not to run properly.\nAlso i keep /home on a separate partition because in case of a reinstall I can keep all the personal settings there and after the system is reinstalled the applications can read the settings from there, otherwise you need to backup the data and restore it after reinstall\n", "Q: Cannot find sound settings menu in Ubuntu 14.04 after removing pulseaudio I cannot get any audio out of my speakers but the headphones work fine in Ubuntu 14.04.

So, if you are on 14.04, and if the API of Leptonica did not change meanwhile (for most projects this is only done at major revisions, and the difference of Leptonica between Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.40 was just a minor revision), also older versions of tesseract should compile with the Leptonica available on Ubuntu 14.04. \nMy recommendation is to simply try to compile it. For most programs this is a matter of not more than a few minutes if all prerequisites are installed.\nWhen talking about prerequisites: The package for Leptonica, which you'll probably need to install in order to be able to build tesseract is called \"libleptonica-dev\". The other \"-dev\" packages you need to install are listed on the page you linked to in your question.\nOf course, if you don't want to edit the tesseract source code, you can use the \"libtesseract-dev\" package in order to install the tesseract libraries and header files.\nA final word: Usually on SVN one gets the latest state of development (meaning: people are actively working on it, so it might in rare cases be in a broken state), and indeed the SVN tree of tesseract seems to contains a version that is at least as new as 3.03. Anyhow, if you don't want to actively contribute to the development of a program and there is no brand new feature that is still missing in the latest official release, I see little use in going for an SVN version, which, as said, might have serious issues or might not even compile.\n", "Q: How to run scripts as user (not as root) in lightdm?

Although, incorrect positioning of the window is still present, but I can coupe with this until better solution emerge.\nI hope this will help someone.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu from USB stick gives error: \"Operating system not found\" I am trying to install Ubuntu from a USB disk on my Dell Inspiron 7537, but I get the error message: Operating system not found.\nI have tried to disable UEFI and use Legacy but without success.\n\nA: Short answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*use pendrive, not USB hard disk\n\n*format it as FAT32\n\n*plug the pendrive first, then power the computer on\n\n*enter BIOS before booting\n\n\nDetailed answer:\nPrepare USB stick exactly as described in Ubuntu documentation:\nHow to create a bootable USB stick on Windows\nHow to create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu\nThis documentation refers to USB stick (a pendrive), I am not sure whether it is possible to boot from external hard disk connected via USB. If you are trying to boot from USB hard disk, it may be a reason of failure; try simple pendrive instead. Also note, that Ubuntu installer will fail when pendrive is formatted as NTFS, use FAT32 instead.\nPlug the pendrive with Ubuntu installer into USB socket, then power your computer on. Press F12 to enter the Boot Menu and choose USB. If USB is not listed then simply enter the BIOS (position Setup in the Boot Menu), then exit and press F12 again; USB should be listed now.\nAfter choosing USB from Boot Menu, Ubuntu installer should start.\n\nA: Hoping that you don't have any data on your HDD. If there is any data try to do back-up and follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check for errors & Format both USB stick and Hard disk.\n\n*Load Ubuntu again on USB using any better tool like LiLi (LinuxLiveUSB).\n\n*Install Ubuntu.\n\n*Comment.\n\n\nA: I have tried many ways to solve this and finally when I used the following settings in BIOS, it booted successfully.\nDevices-Configure SATA as \"IDE\"; Boot Mode: Legacy; Quick Boot: Disabled\nThen I reinstalled Ubuntu from a usb and restarted the desktop. \nI'm working on ThinkVision.

I want to keep everything as clean and tidy as possible.\nThank you.\n\nA: It is not a good idea to use a home partition to be used by both operating systems. There are permissions problem in the first place, and also solving these, Ubuntu does not support writing to HFS+ filesystem and MacOSX does not support writing on EXT4 filesystem.\nWhat you can do is create a shared partition with a filesystem supported in both reading and writing , such as NTFS, and use that partition to exchange data between the two operating systems.\n\nA: I can only answer from the Ubuntu side, since I have no experience with OSX.\nI'd recommend to have separate $HOME folders for both operating systems. So, while your idea will definitely work, you should probably name your users differently, so that the configuration files for the installed programs are separated. Otherwise some programs, which are available on both, Ubuntu and OSX, yet in different versions, might get confused if one is editing the configuration of the other. In order to avoid permission issues, I would try to make sure that your user has the same UID on both systems, so that effectively both home folders belong to the same user. In order to keep everything tidy, you can then symlink the relevant subfolders in one of the home folders to the corresponding folders in the other one (e.g. that /home/linuxuser/Documents is a symlink to /home/osxuser/Documents or the other way round).\n", "Q: Problem with setting static IP on Ubuntu Server 14.04 I have a problem setting the static IP on my Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS.\nWhen I:\n\n*\n\n*run sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces, then\n\n*change dhcp to static, then\n\n*I type address,netmask,network,gateway,dns-nameservers, then\n\n*I try to ping a reliable website (e.g. yahoo.com)\n\nI get an error in response like unknown host yahoo.com and sometimes destination unreachable.\nI also tried to connect through PuTTY, but that's only a local IP. What I actually need is a real IP (like this 109.92.21.200), so that I can connect through PuTTY (which I have on my laptop) and connect to port 22 on my desktop server which is open, but I am constantly getting an error like \"Connection timed out\" or \"Connection refused\".\nHow can I resolve this problem?\n\nA: When I needed to set a static IP address for my ubuntu pc, I did it from the router rather than trying to set it from the pc.\nThe router then sets the IP address given in the router table for the device on each power up.\n\nA: You didn't give an instance of what you actually have in your interfaces file to make it easy for us to see where you're going wrong.  But if you're going to use a manual configuration you'll have to specify other important components which would normally be provided by your dhcp server.\nThis is an example of a working /etc/network/interfaces configuration:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n  address 192.168.1.123\n  gateway 192.168.1.1\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n  dns-search apollo3.com # ths is the doman sufix that you want added to a one word hostname\n  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nThere are other configurations that you can set.  However, these are the most needed that are provided by your dhcp server\nYou can probably get these items by running ifconfig when using the dhcp server, or from your isp/network provider\n\nA: I am sure you are going through the right process. but go through some settings more to make your network interface working.\nSetting up Ip address in /etc/network/interfaces restart your network interface services. \nIf you are getting the same problem then \nOpen terminal and run mii-tool it will show your network card duplex mode. change your duplex mode to 100baseTx-FD to 10Mbit by running this command in terminal.\nsudo mii-tool -F 10baseT-HD\nshould be fixed you problem.\n\nA: Force the interface down and up works.\n  sudo ip link set eth0 down\n  sudo ip link set eth0 up\n\n\nA: $ ls /sys/class/net\n\nthe above steps and most of the recommendations online will work if you first \ndetermine the right nic name for your Ethernet port with the above command\nI was using eth0 as recommended above but looking at the directory /sys/class/net\ntold me the name of my adapter device was em0 instead of eth0\nonce I put the em0 instead of eth0 in the above /etc/network/interfaces file\nI had no slow boot and I could ping out.\n\nA: You do not need to change /etc/network/interfaces or any part of your config beyond your dns servers!\nThe issue is different flags being set for dnsmasq for static ips vs dynamic ip addresses. For static ip address, dnsmasq sets --proxy-dnssec by default. Most IPS do not provide dnssec capable dns servers and therefore dnsmaq timesout. If you set the ip addresses for the dns servers in network manager to a publicly offered dns server with dnssec (google is a good one: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) everything goes back to working.  You do not need to override resolve in any other way. \n", "Q: Installing GLIBC from source I want to install a different version of glibc on my Ubuntu 12.04.

I live in a country (USSR) that does internet censorship, but doesn't (yet?) go so far as to shut off foreign internet altogether, implement \"white-list\" Great Chinese Firewall or ban encryption. I would like to set up a VPN connection on my home router and rented foreign VPS server (say, in Helsinki) with OpenVPN to fully encrypt traffic and safely and reliably circumvent the censorship systems.\nThe thing is, while I'm doing this, I could as well set up a point-to-point encrypted secure connection to my server in Amsterdam.\nHow  should I set up a system for such use? I am familiar with Ubuntu and command-line.\nI think if I go into all the trouble, I could as well set up VPN on a home router (I know it supports VPN), but could I set up VPN at the level of an individual computer or individual application?\nb) access a closed (corporate) network that only accepts outside connections through VPN. First and foremost I had (a) in mind, but now I think if I could have (b) as well. How do I set up a system for such case? Say I'm in Moscow, my VPN server is in Helsinki and my server is in Amsterdam. My connection goes encrypted from Moscow to Amsterdam, but my destination server is further yet, in Amsterdam, so from the VPN endpoint onward it should go as a regular, unencrypted connection; it would be better to have it encrypted all the way, but.. then I wouldn't need a server in Helsinki, or would I?\nI am somewhat familiar with Linux, command line and server administration, just confused about how encryption works in this case.\nI use a home router that should support VPN for all my home devices nicely.\n\nA: There are a few different configurations that could solve your problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up one OpenVPN server (my preference would be on the server in Amsterdam) and both your home router and the server in Helsinki as OpenVPN clients.  The client-to-client configuration option will allow you to see your Helsinki server through the VPN from home.\n\n*Set up a VPN server on the Helsinki server and set up routing for VPN connections.  This seems the most complicated option for the least gain.\n\n*Set up OpenVPN servers on both units and connect to them individually from home.  A big downside here is that you'll have to maintain two CAs or manage passwords in two places.\nPersonally, I would go with option 1 as you will only need to maintain one CA, etc.  OpenVPN has a good HowTo with example server configuration and/or client configuration files.\n", "Q: Emacs doesn't kill-yank anymore after Xubuntu upgrade to 14.04 I just upgraded Xubuntu on my laptop from 13.10 to 14.04.

Excellent so far, except Ubuntu will not accept the install disc for my HP Deskjet F4580. It has recognised the item and allowed me to print even before I tried the disc. Now I wish to scan documents and I can't do this without the HP software installed. It keeps telling me the Archive manager has an error when I try to get it to read the HP disc.It has the HP menu but not start the Set Up process. Is there a remedy please. I really use my scanner a lot and am now lost. Any useful comments please. Stuart\n\nA: Step 1: Install hplip-gui\nThis app does not show up in Ubuntu Software Center. However, it can be installed from the terminal or synaptic. To install it from the terminal open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter:\nsudo apt install hplip-gui\n\nEnter your password when prompted. You won't see the cursor move or ******* when you type the password in the terminal. This is normal.\nStep 2: Install simple-scan\nThis is the scanning utility for Ubuntu. You can either install it from the Ubuntu Software Center or from the terminal. At the terminal, enter:\nsudo apt install simple-scan\n\nOr Combine the 2 Steps\nYou can use one command to install both the software:\nsudo apt install hplip-gui simple-scan\n\nTo Scan a Document\nOpen the simple-scan program when you want to scan a document. Ubuntu does not support scanning directly from the printer.\nHope this helps\n\nA: The install disk that came with your printer would be for windows, perhaps even mac.  This will not work for you.\nYou should just be able to go here and follow the instructions and it should work if you are connected directly.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ScanningHowTo\nHope that helps.\n\nA: hplip + simple-scan work really great!!! (as long as your hplip version is compatible with your printer)\nsudo apt install hplip simple-scan\n\n\n\nThe problem I had is that when I tried to scan from the feeder it just kept scanning from the flatbead instead, over and over again\nThen I realized my hplip version was a bit old and didn't support my new printer, that's why it wasn't recognizing it and Ubuntu was using a generic driver. Check compatibility here (apt show hplip | grep -i version to see your hplip version)\nYou can manually install the newest hplip here https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/gethplip\n\nBTW, although hplip's software didn't recognize my network printer, simple-scan did recognize a new device\n", "Q: How do i find the recently used files through terminal? I want to see the recently used(accessed) files along with their path through terminal. \nHow could i get that files list?\nNote: This question is not a duplicate of Show recent modified/created files using Terminal \n\nA: It works on Ubuntu systems which has nautilus as a default file-manager.\nRun the below command on terminal to see the recently accessed(aka viewed) files.\nsed -nr 's/.*href=\"([^\"]*)\".*/\\1/p' ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\nInformation about all the recently accessed files are stored in this particular ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel file. Extracting only the file along with it's path was done by the above command.\nCommand Explanation:\nsed -nr 's/.*href=\"([^\"]*)\".*/\\1/p' ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\n-n   --> suppress automatic printing of pattern space\n-r   --> Extended regex. If we use sed with -r, then we don't have to escape some characters like ((,),{,},etc)\n's/.*href=\"([^\"]*)\".*/\\1/p' --> sed searches for a line which has this(.*href=\"([^\"]*)\".*) regex in the input file. If it find any, then it grabs only the characters that are within double quotes which was after href=(href=\"\") and stored it in a group. Only the stored group are printed through back-reference(\\1).\nExample:\n$ sed -nr 's/.*href=\"([^\"]*)\".*/\\1/p' ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\nfile:///media/truecrypt8/bar.txt\nfile:///media/truecrypt8/picture.txt\nfile:///media/truecrypt8/bob.txt\nfile:///media/truecrypt8/movie.txt\nfile:///media/truecrypt8/music.txt\nfile:///media/truecrypt8/foo.txt\n\nIf you want the output to be formatted then run this,\n$ sed -nr 's/.*href=\"([^\"]*)\".*/\\1/p' ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel | sed 's|\\/\\/| |g'\nfile: /media/truecrypt8/bar.txt\nfile: /media/truecrypt8/picture.txt\nfile: /media/truecrypt8/bob.txt\nfile: /media/truecrypt8/movie.txt\nfile: /media/truecrypt8/music.txt\nfile: /media/truecrypt8/foo.txt\n\n", "Q: Change Folder Permissions and All Sub-Folders I'm working on a PHP website at the moment and I'm doing a LOT of writing to files and directories.

Now I've actually been here with a similar question before - but was largely inspecific because I didn't know what I was really looking for.\nHowever, onto the question. I have a laptop that I've had for a number of years, and every time without fail that I've attempted to install a Linux distribution onto it, it's spat it right back at my face - instead opting to show a flashing underscore where GRUB should live.\nA number of suggestions to try a bunch of different distros from Crunchbang to Elementary to Debian to Fedora popped up, but unfortunately none of them would boot.\nNow - it's an older laptop (3-4 years) by UK company Novatech. The motherboard is developed by CLEVO Co., and it has an Intel Core 2 Duo T6600 (2.2GHz) with 4GB of RAM and an Nvidia G105M (which I initially thought was the issue).\nWhen you run the LiveUSB/CD of the operating system, it works fine - no issues whatsoever. In fact, it's arguably more compatible out of the box than Windows is (some hardware functions that need drivers on Windows don't on Ubuntu).\nSo I took it down to the differing factors - and a big one was that the USB stick I'm reading off of is set to FAT file system, instead of ext4 (which I thought maybe could be an issue if the developers of the laptop didn't really take much care to support Linux operating systems), and also its a USB stick. It's not the hard drive. I guess that's a pretty big difference in itself.\nAlso, on older versions of Ubuntu, it would briefly after BIOS screen display a piece of text: \"GRUB Loading...\", and it's remain there instead of just the flashing underscore.\nI guess my overall question is - can certain hard-drives not 'have' ext4 partitions? Or can some hard drives be incompatible with Linux/GRUB? Or is it my hardware, and if so - why does it run fine off the memory stick? Would this be solved if I somehow installed Linux onto an NTFS or FAT partition (if that's possible, I imagine it is, with Linux being Linux).\nAnyway, hopefully I didn't kill too many of your sanities with the wall of text.\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: All hard drives are compatible with Linux. The fact that you can successfully partition, format, and install Linux mean that the hard disk works. What your system seems to have a problem with is either installing or booting grub. Grub is not Linux, it is just a boot loader. It is possible that your hard disk has bad blocks, or a problematic SATA controller, but all of the evidence points to some problem with grub and the BIOS, which means you need to look at answers like:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair grub?\n\n*Go into your BIOS settings and make sure it is configured to boot from the hard drive and that any other potential boot devices are disabled (floppy disk etc. may appear in the BIOS, even if you do not have a floppy drive).\n\n*Install the latest Ubuntu LTS and just let it wipe the whole hard disk and do an automatic install. There are reports on the net of Novatech laptops failing to boot with older kernels which do then boot after updating. \n\n*There are also reports of grub1 failing to boot on some systems, so its worth trying grub2. Or try grub1 (grub legacy) if you have been failing with grub2.\n\n*Check your memory for errors\n\n*Check your hard drive for errors\n\n*Try installing another OS (Windows)\n\n*If you are using amd64 try i386 (or vice versa)\n\n*Boot from grub installed to a USB drive, see Ubuntu Wiki BootFromUSB\n\n*Try installing another boot loader instead of grub (syslinux or lilo, or even the DOS boot loader with NeoGRUB) \n\n*Report your problem on the Grub-devel mailing list. It may be possible to fix the source.\nI came across reports of other Novatech laptop users having similar boot problems: one said his issue was fixed after a kernel update, another fixed it by installing LILO instead of GRUB. From what you describe, my guess is that if you install your /boot partition as ext2, and then install LILO, it will boot.\n\nA: They actually should. hat kind of hard drive is it? Internal or external? I do the following settings. \nHDD mode in Bios ACHI \nthen a bootable CD \nthat works fine. \nSome windows xp worked on ATI mode. Changing the mode might help. Press del or F2 just after you see initial screen then you can find the setting and change it. you must save and exit or enter F10 if it works esc works equally well. \ncreate partitions suitable for your needs and you are good to Go. \nyou can always return back or PM me if any Problem arises. \n", "Q: Python command in bash does not find -c flag I have two python lines in my bash script, both should run with -c flag, but once I run the Bash script it tells me that it could not find -c flag that is needed for python to run the command in Bash.

It was a relatively pain-free procedure.\nAfterwards, both ls and stat could work with birth time.\nOutput of ls -l --time=birth --time-style=full-iso --no-group:\n\nOutput of stat on an ext4 file system and a btrfs file system:\n\n(Copied from my other answer on UNIX & Linux Stack Exchange)\n\nA: The inability of stat to show the creation time is due to limitation of the stat(2) system call, whose return struct doesn't include a field for the creation time. Starting with Linux 4.11 (i.e., 17.10 and newer*), however, the new statx(2) system call is available, which does include a creation time in its return struct.\n* And possibly on older LTS releases using the hardware enablement stack (HWE) kernels. Check uname -r to see if you are using a kernel at least at 4.11 to confirm.\nUnfortunately, it's not easy to call system calls directly in a C program. Typically glibc provides a wrapper that makes the job easy, but glibc only added a wrapper for statx(2) in August 2018 (version 2.28, available in 18.10). The stat command itself gained support for statx(2) only in GNU coreutils 8.31 (released in March 2019), however, even Ubuntu 20.04 only has coreutils 8.30.\nBut I don't think this will be backported to LTS releases even if they do get, or are already on, newer kernels or glibcs. So, I don't expect stat on any current LTS release (16.04, 18.04 or 20.04) to ever print the creation time without manual intervention.\nOn 18.10 and newer, you can directly use the statx function as described in man 2 statx (note that the 18.10 manpage is incorrect in stating that glibc hasn't added the wrapper yet).\nAnd in Ubuntu 20.10, you will be able to use stat directly:\n# stat --version\nstat (GNU coreutils) 8.32\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\nWritten by Michael Meskes.\n# stat /\n  File: /\n  Size: 4096        Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory\nDevice: 88h/136d    Inode: 57279593    Links: 1\nAccess: (0755/drwxr-xr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nAccess: 2020-08-18 06:57:46.912243164 +0000\nModify: 2020-08-18 06:57:06.768492334 +0000\nChange: 2020-08-18 06:57:59.136165661 +0000\n Birth: 2020-08-18 06:57:06.768492334 +0000\n\n\nFor older systems, luckily, @whotwagner wrote a sample C program that shows how to use the statx(2) system call on x86 and x86-64 systems. Its output is the same format as stat's default, without any formatting options, but it's simple to modify it to print just the birth time.\nFirst, clone it:\ngit clone https://github.com/whotwagner/statx-fun\n\nYou can compile the statx.c code, or, if you just want the birth time, create a birth.c in the cloned directory with the following code (which is a minimal version of statx.c printing just the creation timestamp including nanosecond precision):\n#define _GNU_SOURCE\n#define _ATFILE_SOURCE\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include \"statx.h\"\n#include <time.h>\n#include <getopt.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n// does not (yet) provide a wrapper for the statx() system call\n#include <sys/syscall.h>\n\n/* this code works ony with x86 and x86_64 */\n#if __x86_64__\n#define __NR_statx 332\n#else\n#define __NR_statx 383\n#endif\n\n#define statx(a,b,c,d,e) syscall(__NR_statx,(a),(b),(c),(d),(e))\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    int dirfd = AT_FDCWD;\n    int flags = AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW;\n    unsigned int mask = STATX_ALL;\n    struct statx stxbuf;\n    long ret = 0;\n\n    int opt = 0;\n\n    while(( opt = getopt(argc, argv, \"alfd\")) != -1)\n    {\n        switch(opt) {\n            case 'a':\n                flags |= AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT;\n                break;\n            case 'l':\n                flags &= ~AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW;\n                break;\n            case 'f':\n                flags &= ~AT_STATX_SYNC_TYPE;\n                flags |= AT_STATX_FORCE_SYNC;\n                break;\n            case 'd':\n                flags &= ~AT_STATX_SYNC_TYPE;\n                flags |= AT_STATX_DONT_SYNC;\n                break;\n            default:\n                exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (optind >= argc) {\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    for (; optind < argc; optind++) {\n        memset(&stxbuf, 0xbf, sizeof(stxbuf));\n        ret = statx(dirfd, argv[optind], flags, mask, &stxbuf);\n        if( ret < 0)\n        {\n            perror(\"statx\");\n            return EXIT_FAILURE;\n        }\n        printf(\"%lld.%u\\n\", *&stxbuf.stx_btime.tv_sec, *&stxbuf.stx_btime.tv_nsec);\n    }\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n\nThen:\n$ make birth\n$ ./birth ./birth.c\n1511793291.254337149\n$ ./birth ./birth.c | xargs -I {} date -d @{}\nMon Nov 27 14:34:51 UTC 2017\n\nIn theory this should make the creation time more accessible:\n\n*\n\n*more filesystems should be supported than just the ext* ones (debugfs is a tool for ext2/3/4 filesystems, and unusable on others)\n\n*you don't need root to use this (except for installing some required packages, like make and linux-libc-dev).\n\nTesting out an xfs system, for example:\n$ truncate -s 1G temp; mkfs -t xfs temp; mkdir foo; sudo mount temp foo; sudo chown $USER foo\n$ touch foo/bar\n$ # some time later\n$ echo > foo/bar\n$ chmod og-w foo/bar\n$ ./birth foo/bar | xargs -I {} date -d @{}\nMon Nov 27 14:43:21 UTC 2017\n$ stat foo/bar                             \n  File: foo/bar\n  Size: 1           Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file\nDevice: 700h/1792d  Inode: 99          Links: 1\nAccess: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: ( 1000/ muru)      Gid: ( 1000/ muru)\nAccess: 2017-11-27 14:43:32.845579010 +0000\nModify: 2017-11-27 14:44:38.809696644 +0000\nChange: 2017-11-27 14:44:45.536112317 +0000\n Birth: -\n\nHowever, this didn't work for NTFS and exfat.

I've installed the Ubuntu 12.4 OS on it so I could begin learning to code. Because I prefer the Chrome browser, I've also installed Google Chrome stable (Version 35.0.1916.114). Everything has worked smoothly for the last couple months, but last night video stopped working on all websites. When I switch to Firefox, videos \"sometimes\" play, but are stopping frequently. I've researched similar issues on this forum and others, but none of the solutions provided (clearing browser data/caches, opening windows in incognito mode, making sure I have an updated Shockwave flashplayer version and that no other flashplayers or media players are interfering, making sure the chrome browser is updated, have worked. I've even uninstalled and re-installed the chrome browser, and have also reset the browser, but it still won't play videos.\nWhen I go to YouTube, or any other site with imbedded video for that matter, it will play the video for what seems a millisecond, but not play past that part. There is NO white/gray/black screen or anything else. It simply stops after I first start the video. What is interesting is that when I switch from Ubuntu back to the default Chromebook, videos play fine. So I'm thinking this may be an Ubuntu issue. Unfortunately, I'm unfamiliar with diagnosing driver issues, if that is the problem. I should also add that internet speed is fine. No issues there.\n\nA: Flash is an application made by Adobe that displays movies, games, or other content within a web browser. It’s an old web standard that’s slowly being phased out by HTML5 — however, many websites still use Flash plugins for videos, games, and tools. Google Chrome is a browser made by, well, Google (you know, the search engine giant), and it has nearly half of the current marketshare, including support for themes, extensions and HTML5. While Chrome scores higher on browser tests than its competitors, it does have some known issues with Flash — and here’s how to fix them.\nFirst off, issues with Flash games and the such — those can’t be fixed. Chrome and Flash games don’t play well together, for whatever reason — even if Flash is working perfectly fine — so for those, you should definitely go to Mozilla Firefox or another browser to enjoy some flash gaming. For your normal Flash video issues — like lagging and crashing — here’s where you need to go.\nFirst, type about:plugins in your Chrome address bar and press Enter to view what plugins you have installed and are running.\nThis is where the Flash plugins are stored.\nHow To Stop The Plugin Conflict\nSearch for Flash in the plugins list and then check if it says (2 files) in parenthesis beside it.\nIf it says two files, that means two different installations of Flash — one on your system and one just for the Chrome installation — are conflicting, and that’s where your problem lies.\nHow To Stop The Plugin Conflict\nSearch for Flash in the plugins list and then check if it says (2 files) in parenthesis beside it.\nIf it says two files, that means two different installations of Flash — one on your system and one just for the Chrome installation — are conflicting, and that’s where your problem lies.\nClick the + sign next to Details and use the Location tags to determine where each installation is located. Disable the one off your home directory. \nIf Issues Persist\nFirst, re-activate the Chrome plugin and turn off the operating system plugin. (The opposite of the steps above.)\nIf that doesn’t fix your issue, deactivate each of your extensions and start Chrome again — an easy way to go about this is to open up an incognito window with extensions disabled. To open up an incognito window, click Chrome’s Menu icon and select Open Incognito Window from the drop down box. By default, incognito starts without extensions. Go to a flash-based page and see if you have any issues. If you don’t, good job — one of your extensions is causing the problem.\nTo solve this, open up your list of Extensions and one by one, re-enable them while viewing how they effect your Flash performance. To open the list of extensions, open your menu once more, hover over Tools and click Extensions. When you’ve determined which one has been causing you all this trouble, delete or disable it.\nSource: http://www.reviversoft.com/blog/2013/03/fix-adobe-flash-problems-in-google-chrome/\n", "Q: How hold smb in Personal folder?

Is there anything that can be done to rectify this issue?\n\nA: So I had the same problem with 14.04LTS.  But I know that Ubuntu 12.04LTS DOES work with the LE1600 touchscreen. \nSo recently, I tried installing 12.04LTS and then immediately upgraded to 14.04LTS, and happily, this seems to work in terms of enabling the touchscreen.  I don't know about the reliability of this technique, but better than nothing.   \nIf that isn't a satisfactory solution, in 12.04LTS, the touchscreen is detected as a Wacom tablet, so whatever the problem is, I would look there.\n", "Q: How to translate ListElement property with Ubuntu SDK I have my fist Ubuntu Touch QML app running, and I am willing to translate it.\nWhenever I use a UI string in the qml files, I was careful to use i18n.tr(\"my text\").\nSo now I need to generate the pot, po, and mo files.

I should not have tried to install and compile Python 2.75. After everything went haywire, I saw someone on this site caution against doing this very thing.\nI am running Django and it was working fine until the upgrade attempt. I then managed to switch the default version from 2.73 to 2.75 and by doing a make install within the python dir. When I checked the version running the OS said 2.75, so I figured great it worked. NOT SO. Django then stopped working.\nI attempted to switch back to 2.73 and that seemed to have worked. However, now I get python errors showing that Django, PIL etc are not installed. So, I thought to try and re-install them and I get these messages \"Requirement already satisfied\" and that the packages are in the dist-packages dir in the python 2. 7 directory. What happened? How do I fix this?\nI have tried creating a running a simple test script containing this code:\n    from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib\n    print(get_python_lib())\n\nand it worked. So, I know python 2.73 is functional, but my libraries including Django do not work still.

This is just a theoretical for me (it's a real problem for another user) but let's say:\n\n\n*\n\n*I upgrade a load of packages from a PPA onto 12.04\n\n*I upgrade to 14.04\n\n*Some packages are held in because my PPA-upgraded packages have newer versions that are breaking dependencies\n\n\nBy this point I think it's too late for ppa-purge to be useful.

But how can I do that? \n\nA: *\n\n*Ideally ppa-purge should work, as it is same procedure. PPA has always a version that is higher then both of precise and trusty.\n\n*The only case I think of, is when dealing absolute packages or renamed ones (If a transient package is not provides).\nIn this case, I would suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add back all precise repositories.\necho -e \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main universe multiverse restricted\\ndeb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security main universe multiverse restricted\\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-update main universe multiverse restricted\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/precise.list\n\n\n*Update package lists\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Purge the PPA\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:...\n\nIf didn't work try:\nsudo ppa-purge -d precise ppa:...\n\nYou can try also aptitude which provides solutions with downgrade.\nSometimes, manual fix is the only option.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use remove those package without their dependents, using\nsudo dpkg -r --force-depends ...\n##disable ppa source then\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n\n*Or force installing specific version from official repository. But you have to put all related packages in same command.\nsudo apt-get install pkg1=ver1 pkg2=ver2 ...\n\n\n*In the worst case you can download those packages with version from official repository and force install them using:\nsudo dpkg -i --force-depends ...\n\nAFAIK APT does not have away to do that.\n\nA: You need to create a file (let's say 00_reset_ppas) in folder /etc/apt/preferences.d with the following contents \nPackage: *\nPin: release o=Ubuntu\nPin-Priority: 1100\n\nAfter that run \nsudo apt update\nsudo apt full-upgrade\n\nand most (or even better all) packages from PPAs would be replaced from the standard ones that come with ubuntu, provided that there is no nanimg conflicts (ie packages with different names in ppas) that may introduce conflicts. \n", "Q: Use multiple byobu sessions, while ignoring unrelated tmux sessions So, I have access to a shared shell account where other people and I do some work.\nSome people prefer use tmux, so they have open their tmux sessions, loading config from ~/.tmux.conf. I prefer to use byobu wrapper around tmux, since it has much nicer keybindings and other stuff.\nThe problem is whenever there is a tmux session used by other people, whenever I run byobu it resumes their tmux session instead of creating a new byobu session for me.\nSo, I tried running byobu-tmux new-session, but then it starts a new tmux session using their config (from ~/.tmux.conf) instead of byobu.\nHow can I workaround that?\n\nA: The tmux program is designed to be run as a single server process that manages one or more independent sessions. The configuration file is loaded by the server process when it starts and is applied to new sessions when they are created. Running tmux new-session (or, equivalently in this case, byobu new-session) contacts the running server if there is one, and requests that it create a new session. The server uses a known path for its socket based only on the UID of the user, and that is all that is needed to connect to a running tmux server. So this is why if a \"normal\" tmux session is already running, byobu will either attach to or create a new session using that server.\nAccording to the tmux man page, you can simply change the socket used by tmux to start two independent tmux servers, each with their own sets of configuration if desired. You can either specify -L to change the base name of the socket or the -S option to specify a completely different path to the socket file. The default tmux socket is named default.\nSo, using these tmux options when calling byobu, to start an independent tmux server with byobu, you can run\nbyobu -L my-byobu new\n\nor\nbyobu -L my-byobu attach\n\nwhere the name my-byobu can be replaced with any name of your choice. This starts a new tmux server with the name my-byobu, which loads the byobu configuration for tmux instead of the default, and effectively creates an independent namespace for your byobu tmux sessions.\n", "Q: Xfce4 keybinding and logout randomly not working since Ubuntu 14.04 I upgraded my ubuntu installation from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS a few weeks ago.\nEverything works fine except Xfce4.\nSince the update, I'm sometimes unable to use my custom keybindings (like alt-F1 in order to open a terminal).

I installed Ubuntu in windows by making separate partition. \nMy both OS are installed in legacy mode but I want to switch to UEFI. When I switch to UEFI MODE a black screen comes up instead of grub and it asks me to press ESC. \nIs it possible to switch to UEFI ?\nDo I need to make any partition for EFI ?\nThanks in advance...\n\nA: Switching Linux to boot in EFI mode is relatively easy; you just need to install the EFI-mode boot loader of your choice, although this will require that you create an EFI System Partition (ESP), and some EFIs also require you to convert the disk from MBR to GPT.\nSwitching Windows to boot in EFI mode is harder. The same steps are required, but Windows makes it a bit harder to perform those steps. If you're interested, I recommend you read this page, which describes the process in detail.\nOverall, I'd say it's not worth the hassle unless you've got some compelling reason, such as if you're replacing a sub-2TiB disk with one that's larger than 2TiB (and that therefore requires GPT, and hence an EFI-mode boot of Windows).\n\nA: The only way is to actually install Ubuntu in the UEFI boot mode.  However, you can keep what ever windows install there.  In windows, run fdisk, there create a second partition, split the drive in half(considering you have the space to pull off.).  At which point, you will then use the USB install point of Ubuntu.\nHowever, since you now have a legacy install and a UEFI install, you will have to pick which boot you want every time.  So you would have to press F12 if you wanted to boot in Windows, which will require a reboot.  Also, please note that GRUB2 might not see Windows because the boot partition will not see legacy.\nThis Q&A should answer anything else you want done.\n", "Q: pam_systemd delays SSH login - required?

I am new to Ubuntu and I couldn't figure out which file to edit so that I can assign the static IP. \n\nA: I found I had to include the dns settings:\nauto lo enp0s25\n\niface lo inet loopback\n\niface enp0s25 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.128\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n    dns-search example.com\n    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-configuration.html\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will solve your problem, but this answers your question and I think it's worth a shot.\nTo assign a static IP, you need to edit /etc/network/interfaces.\nThe interface will probably be called eth0.\nThe current entry will look something like:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nYou will need to change this to:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n   address 10.253.0.50\n   netmask 255.255.255.0\n   network 10.253.0.0\n   gateway 10.253.0.1\n   dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8\n\nYou will have to change the numbers around depending on your network, but you can find out the information by checking out ipconfig from Windows.\nMake sure you choose an address outside the address space of the DHCP server.\nThen restart networking sudo service networking restart. If that gives you trouble, reboot the machine.\n\nA: Set your IP address changes in /etc/network/interfaces. Example:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n\naddress 192.168.1.128\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\nDon't give your DNS configurations in /etc/resolv.conf because while we restart the server sometimes the configuration get erased.\nSo use vim /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base (while updating configs in this it doesn't get removed)\nexample:\nsearch  (domain name)\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nSave and then restart your server, this fixed my static issue! :)\n\nA: Change the interfaces config:\n$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\nThen replace the following configuration:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto ens160\niface ens160 inet static\n# Enter your specific IP address\n        address 192.168.1.130\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        gateway 192.168.1.1\n        dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nThen trigger it via:\n$ sudo service networking restart\n\nor\n$ sudo ifdown ens160; ifup ens160\n\nIf you encountered with an error, do the following command:\n$ ip addr flush dev ens160\nAlso, you can reboot the os: sudo reboot\n\n[NOTE]:\n\n*\n\n*ens160 is my ethernet name, you can check it via $ ifconfig command.\n\n*This works and tested in Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04.\n\n*Here's Ubuntu 18.04 configuration method.\n\nA: Ubuntu 20.04 doesn't have /etc/network/interfaces and uses /etc/netplan/<config file>.yaml instead.\nThe .yaml config file is auto generated and can have many names but as long as it has .yaml extension it should work fine. Mine was 50-cloud-init.yaml on one machine, 00-installer-config.yaml on another.\nTo set the ip to 192.168.0.102, in /etc/netplan/<config file>.yaml:\nnetwork:\n    ethernets:\n        eth0:\n            dhcp4: false\n            addresses: [192.168.0.102/24]\n            gateway4: 192.168.0.1\n            nameservers:\n              addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4,192.168.0.1]\n    version: 2\n\nYou can look up what your current gateway is using ip route and put that in instead of 192.168.0.1\nAlso instead of eth0 you can have a different name for your network. If so, keep your network's name there.\nThen sudo netplan apply\nThis kicked me out of SSH because I was SSHed through an old ip. I had to reboot the computer manually. Restarting router is a good idea too at this point to clear possible ip conflicts.\nAlso I found suggestions to edit the generator of this yaml file in /etc/cloud but I found no fool-proof docs how to do this. Instead, Canonical provides https://netplan.io/examples with a whole bunch of copy-paste configurations for the config.yaml file, which seem like a great approach for most cases.\n", "Q: \"'Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'\" when trying to do commands The other day I was using MySQL on my local database fine from the terminal.

I'd no problem during installing, however, once it is done it has become annoying as performance is unforgivably abysmal. It runs dead slow that i have to keep typing in vigorously for entering as basic and short a word as password.

It doesn't make it not accessible though.\n\nA: You can change the partition's type code using fdisk (or gdisk for GPT disks). Specifically, the t command in these programs enables you to change the type code. Change it from 07 to 83 (for MBR/fdisk) or from 0700 to 8300 (for GPT/gdisk). This will hide the partition from view in Windows.\nThat said, I don't recommend doing as you suggest. NTFS is a Windows filesystem, not a Linux filesystem, so if you want to use a partition in Linux but not in Windows, there are no advantages to using NTFS and lots of disadvantages, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lack of support for Linux-style file ownership.\n\n*Lack of support for Linux-style permissions.\n\n*Poor performance compared to Linux-native filesystems.\n\n*Lack of filesystem maintenance tools.\n\n\nInstead, use a Linux-native filesystem for Linux. Unless you install the relevant driver, Windows will then be unable to read that filesystem (although it could damage or destroy it, given enough malice, persistence, or bad luck).\nAlso, given your responses to earlier suggestions, I think you need to clarify precisely what your intent is in this. So long as a disk is plugged into a computer, there's really nothing you can do to completely safeguard data on that disk from tampering by whatever OS is currently running on the computer. If you want that sort of safeguard, the only acceptable solution is to unplug the disk. If you just want to avoid accidental damage or unauthorized access by relative computer novices, changing the type code or removing the drive letter (as Cornelius suggested) should suffice.\n", "Q: How to view UTF-8 Unicode characters in VIM I am using VIM 7.4 on an Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit machine. In my .vimrc file, I have the following lines:\n\" Use UTF-8 without BOM\nset encoding=utf-8 nobomb\n\nThe config file basically uses Unicode character to display white spaces like tabs, new lines, etc. The complete .vimrc file is taken from Paul Irish's dotfiles.\nOn an earlier install of 14.04 as well as in previous distributions, I was able to see the unicode characters without any problems but not with this one.\nI also tried:\n set fileencodngs=utf-8\n\nBut, the above setting has no effect and I still see garbled characters on the screen.

Ubuntu and many other Linux distribution are based on Debian so this bug propagates to several Linux distributions. To fix this bug, you have to edit the nsswitch configuration file. Open a terminal and use the following command:\nsudo gedit /etc/nsswitch.conf\n\nThis will open the configuration file in gedit so that you could edit it easily in GUI.

In the past I remember that (maybe with grub1) I could point to second disk mbr and then Windows booted normally.\nSo my config is:\nDisk /dev/sda: 128.0 GB, 128035676160 bytes\n255 testine, 63 settori/tracce, 15566 cilindri, totale 250069680 settori\nUnità = settori di 1 * 512 = 512 byte\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nIdentificativo disco: 0x0007d87d\n\nDispositivo Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   175781887    87889920   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2       175783934   250068991    37142529    5  Esteso\n/dev/sda5       175783936   246163455    35189760   83  Linux\n/dev/sda6       246165504   250068991     1951744   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 testine, 63 settori/tracce, 60801 cilindri, totale 976773168 settori\nUnità = settori di 1 * 512 = 512 byte\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nIdentificativo disco: 0xb3e7a9bf\n\nDispositivo Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1            2048      206847      102400   de  Dell Utility\n/dev/sdb2          206848    30926847    15360000    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sdb3   *    30926848   167600175    68336664    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sdb4       167604160   976768064   404581952+   f  W95 Esteso (LBA)\n/dev/sdb5       167606208   976768064   404580928+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nHere is my /boot/grub/grub.cfg section of os-prober\nmenuentry 'Windows 7 (loader) (su /dev/sdb2)' --class windows --class os $menuentry_id_option 'osprober-chain-CC70378A703779F2' {\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ntfs\nset root='hd1,msdos2'\nif [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd1,msdos2 --hint-efi=hd1,msdos2 --hint-baremetal=ahci1,msdos2  CC70378A703779F2\nelse\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root CC70378A703779F2\nfi\nparttool ${root} hidden-\nchainloader +1\n}\n\nmenuentry 'Windows 7 (loader) (su /dev/sdb3)' --class windows --class os $menuentry_id_option 'osprober-chain-AC7C4EC27C4E86D4' {\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ntfs\nset root='hd1,msdos3'\nif [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd1,msdos3 --hint-efi=hd1,msdos3 --hint-baremetal=ahci1,msdos3  AC7C4EC27C4E86D4\nelse\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root AC7C4EC27C4E86D4\nfi\nparttool ${root} hidden-\nchainloader +1\n}\n\nBoth give me this message if i selected them on boot menu:\nerror: no such device: CC70378A703779F2 (or AC7C4EC27C4E86D4)\nerror: hd1 cannot get C/H/S values\n\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/hvE3k.jpg\nLast, but not the least, from my BIOS i cannot change hard drive boot priority, so there's no way to boot /dev/sdb first.\nEdit:\nthis is my blkid\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"1597fe18-faf5-48a5-b80f-4cbb7f8b896e\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"ea6548f1-3004-49ff-8d1d-4c84dfed3a6a\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"e24dbc3b-d2da-4a63-97ce-7430cfce9fce\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sdb1: SEC_TYPE=\"msdos\" LABEL=\"DELLUTILITY\" UUID=\"3030-3030\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n/dev/sdb2: LABEL=\"Recovery\" UUID=\"CC70378A703779F2\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sdb3: LABEL=\"OS\" UUID=\"AC7C4EC27C4E86D4\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sdb5: LABEL=\"VostroHD\" UUID=\"01CCBB70E50A71E0\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n\nEDIT:\nI ran bootinfo script.

So I got Ubuntu working. Problem is if I keep both my SSD and HDD drive connected to the motherboard, Windows automatically starts up completely disregarding Ubuntu.\nAt the moment, i'd like both OSs present for testing. I couldn't install two OSs on my new SSD because I don't have the installation CD for Windows.\nHow can I set Ubuntu as default boot up and is there a way to choose between the two hard drives what OS to use on powering up the computer?\n\nA: You can choose what HDD to boot from in BIOS setup.\nTo enter BIOS setup hit F2 or Del (or maybe some other key) when powering up your computer.\nThe menu you need is named something like Boot or Boot Priority or maybe you'll need to change HDD priority (also in BIOS setup).\nAfter you manage to boot from your SSD (where Ubuntu is installed) you'll probably see grub boot menu, where you should be able to choose which OS to boot. If not you should try configuring grub after booting Ubuntu.\nIt would be also usefull for you to read this question and answers.\n", "Q: Replacing XP with Lubuntu: How do I get my wireless to work? Experience level with LUI: total noob\nNetbook: Acer One, intel Atom with Win XP, 32-bit\nHi all,\nI've searched and searched but finally I'm stuck at this point. Maybe the answer is in another forum but it seems there are always very specific things that are sliiiightly different that mine. There are a couple weird things during installation that aren't usually mentioned in most of the tutorials.. I'll mention it in case it's relevant. It's quite possible this is just the noob in me speaking.. anyways:\nAfter installing Lubuntu desktop and rebooting the first time, I was prompted to select either win xp or lubuntu during startup, so of course I selected lubuntu. But it went back to windows desktop. I tried rebooting a couple times, then on one I hit F12 to give me the option again and after selecting lubuntu a second time, it loaded/installed.\nBut, during that initial install, the message \"Serious errors were found while checking the disk drive for /.\" displayed. So, finally I tracked down this discussion Ubuntu 14.04 not booting after error message. /tmp could not be mounted after which I changed \"ro\" to \"rw\" (despite the top saying something slightly different that GUN Grub2.. I can't remember exactly but I suspect it's related to mine being Lubuntu, and that topic being Ubuntu). Anyway, it worked and loaded to the Ubuntu desktop (!!!).\nI've never had it hardwired into a network, only ever using it with wifi from what I can remember - I want to maintain the netbook's ability to auto detect any wifi networks, as I plan to use this when I'm in hostels, traveling, etc. Just something simple. So far, when I go to menu>preferences>network connections, the only option is Ethernet...\nThe closest fix I've found is here https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-nettool/+question/218406 So, I entered \nsudo lshw -C network -numeric ; lsb_release -rcd ; uname -r ; lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 net ; lsusb ; rfkill list all ; dmesg | egrep 'error|irmware|NET|wlan'\nWhich gives me:\n*-network               \n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: RTL8101E/RTL8102E PCI Express Fast Ethernet controller [10EC:8136]\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

windows (or all not minimized windows) form one workspace to another? \nI know I can move one window to other workspace with Shift+Ctrl+Alt+arrow, but it will move only that one focused window.\n\nA: Unity : What are Viewports?\nUbuntu Unity uses viewports  - basically a coordinate system (with coordinate 0,0 being top left corner) , where one giant desktop subdivided into chunks that fit your screen resolution. Coordinates grow in value as you move to the right and downwards.\n\nThe coordinate system is relative. If my current viewport is top left , everything relative to that viewport will be positive values in increments of width and height.  For instance, if my current viewport is top leftmost,  the firefox window in top middle workspace you see above is positioned in at x value 1366 and y value 0 relative to the top leftmost viewport. If my active viewport is top middle one, the terminal window in top leftmost viewport is positioned at x value -1327 60.  This is the key issue for xdotool , because xdotool does not deal with negative numbers. \nNote also that, the top left corner of your current viewport will always be assumed by xdotool as coordinates 0 0 . That means we can only move stuff right and down.\nMaking xdotool work for Unity\nNow we know that xdotool can move windows only relative to our top-left corner ( i.e., you can always move window down and right , but never up and left ). How do we make that work for unity. Well, the basic idea would be to \n\n\n*\n\n*Figure out all the windows on current viewport\n\n*Move to a requested viewport momentarily to make the top left corner  assume coordinates 0 0 at that viewport\n\n*Move all windows to user-defined viewport coordinates\n\n*Return to the old viewport ( optional , could follow the windows as well )\n\n\nScripting Solution\nThe script below performs exactly the procedure described above. It can be called with either -v flag to manually specify coordinates or you can use -g flag to bring up GUI dialog. -f flag will tell the script to switch viewport too ; if that flag is not used - you'll remain on the current viewport and only windows will be moved around\nObtaining the script\nOne can copy the source code from this post directly or through github using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install git\n\n*cd /opt ; sudo git clone https://github.com/SergKolo/sergrep.git\n\n*sudo chmod -R +x sergrep\nThe script file will be /opt/sergrep/move_viewport_windows.sh\nTo bind script to shortcut , refer to How do I bind .sh files to keyboard combination?\nNote that wmctrl and xdotool are required for this script to work\nproperly. You can install them via sudo apt-get install\nxdotool and wmctrl\nSource Code\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n#\n###########################################################\n# Author: Serg Kolo , contact: 1047481448@qq.com \n# Date: April 17 2016\n# Purpose: Move all windows on the current viewport\n#          to a user-defined one\n# Written for:\n# Tested on: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS , Unity 7.2.6\n###########################################################\n# Copyright: Serg Kolo , 2016\n#    \n#     Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software is hereby granted\n#     without fee, provided that  the copyright notice above and this permission statement\n#     appear in all copies.\n#\n#     THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n#     IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n#     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It will be attempted to add the momentary unset and reset of that plugin to make the script work with all windows, but because unsetting and resetting has a time delay, it might be abandoned as an idea. If you want the script to make working with all windows, install unity-tweak-tool and unset window snapping under Window Manager options.\n\nA: Non-Compiz based desktop environments (XFCE, LXDE, GNOME, KDE...)\nYou can use a combination of wmctrl and xdotool for this. First make sure these two utilities are installed:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl\n\nWith the dependencies satisfied you should be able to use the following one-liner to move all windows on the current desktop to another one:\nwhile read i; do wmctrl -i -t 2 -r \"$i\"  ; done  < <(wmctrl -l | awk -v var=$(xdotool get_desktop) '{if ($2 == var) print $0;}' | cut -d' '  -f1)\n\nA quick breakdown of the commands used:\n\n\n*\n\n*wmctrl -l | awk -v var=$(xdotool get_desktop) '{if ($2 == var) print $0;}' | cut -d' '  -f1\nList all windows, filter out those that aren't on the current workspace, and extract their window ID\n\n*wmctrl -i -t 2 -r \"$i\"\nMove window with window ID $i to workspace 2.\n\n*all of this is packed in a simple while read ... do; done loop that iterates over all windows on the current desktop\nCompiz-based desktop environments (e.g. Unity)\nFinding a solution for desktop environments like Unity is made difficult by the fact that Compiz (Unity's window manager) does not use desktops in a traditional sense.\n\nA: I made something similar to glutanimate's approach\nHere's a bash script that does that:\nfor window in `wmctrl -l | awk -v var=$(xdotool get_desktop) '{if ($2 == var) print $0;}' | cut -d' '  -f1`\ndo \n        target=$(($1-1))\n        wmctrl -i -t $target -r \"$window\"\ndone\n\nwmctrl -s $target\n\nJust run it passing the target window (1-based index) as an argument, like so: bash move_ws.sh 3 (move all current windows to workspace in index 3 (counting from 1))\nHowever, I figured instead of sending all windows to some workspace i. I thought it would be more useful to swap adjaecent workspaces.\nFor example if you are currently in workspace 2 and your workspaces are like this (left to right / top to bottom):\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nYou can run my script bash swap_ws.sh down (or just map a keyboard shortcut like I did). And 2 will be swapped with 3:\n1\n3\n2\n4\n\nTheoretically, the workspaces don't swap, but all the windows do.\nYou can also use bash swap-ws.sh up and it works as expected.\nHere's the code.\nJust remember to run it with bash:\ncur_ws=$(xdotool get_desktop)\nmax_ws=$(xdotool get_num_desktops)\n\n# determine destination workspace based on current workspace\nif [ \"$1\" = \"up\" ] && [ $cur_ws -gt 0 ]; then\n    next_ws=$((cur_ws-1))        \nelif [ \"$1\" = \"down\" ] && [ $cur_ws -lt $max_ws ]; then\n    next_ws=$((cur_ws+1))\nelse \n    exit 0\nfi\n\nsource_win=$(wmctrl -l | grep -oE \"[0-9a-f]x[0-9a-f]+\\s+$cur_ws\" | cut -f1 -d\" \")\ntarget_win=$(wmctrl -l | grep -oE \"[0-9a-f]x[0-9a-f]+\\s+$next_ws\" | cut -f1 -d\" \")\n\n# push each window from current to next ws\nfor win in $source_win; do\n    wmctrl -i -r \"$win\" -t \"$next_ws\"\ndone\n\n# pull each window from next ws to current\nfor win in $target_win; do\n    wmctrl -i -r \"$win\" -t \"$cur_ws\"\ndone\n\n# go to target workspace\nwmctrl -s $next_ws\n\nNOTE: This script works better if you used a static number of workspaces (you can change that in Tweaks if you're using GNOME)\n", "Q: Re-enter cisco vpn passwords Since I upgraded from Lubuntu 13.10 to 14.04 my VPN passwords have to be re-entered every time I open the VPN connection.\nThe passwords used to be maintained by the key ring but no longer. When I create a new configuration using Cisco Compatible VPN (vpnc) it looks like it is storing the passwords in the keyring. A popup appears and asks for my password.\nAny body any ideas?\n\nA: Okay this is what went wrong.\nAfter I upgraded from Lubuntu 13.10 to 14.4 the network manager was missing in my panel. I solved this by adding nm-applet --sm-enable & in my .profile. At first this seemed to be a good solution, the network manager reappeared again. But the problem mentioned above occurred.\nWhat I should have done to get my network manager back again is select Preferences -> Default applications for LXSessions. Click the tab Autostart and type after + Add \"nm-applet\". Then click + Add. After logging on again the network manager is where one would expect it to be and Keyring will work as well to fill in the stored passwords.\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/fix-lubuntu-1404-network-manager.html\nCheers.\n", "Q: Slow performance while opening applications I moved from Win 8.1 64bit to Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit with a fresh install from DVD.

that may be your problem from video card like it may be old to run high graphic that found in unity or have problem in drivers for it like you must use proprietary driver not open source for your vga or opposite \nso try that two from devices manager settings if same problem still found and you tried all solution above so try to install light Desktop Environment which haven't graphics like lxde or lighter that it \nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nlog in to this DE in see if you still feel slow or not\n\nA: resolved by reinstalling with 32-bit OS\n", "Q: kde 4.13 and oxygen transparent Hi guys I downloaded and installed Kubuntu 14.04 yesterday and set all options and customization as I want but one of my favourite options is set my widget style to oxygen-transparent which make whole desktop environment kde to be have transparent I can do that to kde 4.11 but after installed kubuntu 14.04 which came with kde 4.13 this theme can't work and doesn't make my desktop environment to be transparent\nIs oxygen-transparent not compatible anymore with higher kde version???\nhttp://kde-look.org/content/show.php/oxygen-transparent?content=127752\n\nA: It seems it isn't compatible with KDE 4.13. I tried to use it on an Arch install and it does not load the transparency effects. I have looked into their repository and didn't see any recent activity to make widget compatible cu KDE 4.13.

When going through the installation steps it says that no other OS is found. How do I get back to Windows. I want to dual boot. \n\nA: I don't think you can get back to your windows 7. You just need to format it then after installing windows 7 you may follow this step in dual booting it. Dual Booting it's the best tutorial I've seen so far and it worked for me.

I know I can become root (super user) via the su command but I have to authorize it after entering the commands. Is there a way I can become root and authorize (with password) in one line\n\nA: Well, the only thing I can think of is \necho 'password' | sudo -S command\n\nThe -S flag makes sudo read the password from the standard input. As explained in man sudo:\n\n-S, --stdin\nWrite the prompt to the standard error and read the password from the standard input\n   instead of using the terminal device.  The password must be followed by a newline character.\n\nSo, to run ls with sudo privileges, you would do\necho 'password' | sudo -S ls\n\nNote that this will produce an error if your sudo access token is active, if you don't need to enter your password because you've already done so recently. To get around that, you could use -k to reset the access token:\necho 'password' | sudo -kS ls\n\nI don't know of any way of getting you into an actual root shell (like su or sudo -i) do. This might be enough for what you need though. \n\nA: The echo 'password' | sudo -kS ls solution works, but it has a few security drawbacks, most of which have already been mentioned in the comments to terdon's answer. Thus, I would like to suggest a different approach:\nIf it is only one command that you frequently need to execute, e.g. apt-get upgrade, you can configure your system such that sudo someCommand does not require a password.\nTo do that, run visudo and enter something similar to the following:\nmyusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get upgrade\n\nNote that if you enter a command without an argument (e.g. without upgrade in this example), the user will be allowed to run it with any argument, so use with care.\n\nA: Vader, from your comment on your original question, you'd like to switch to an interactive shell running with super-user permissions, right?\nSudo has a specific argument to request a shell:\n-s [command]\nThe -s (shell) option runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if\nit is set or the shell as specified in the password database. If a command is\nspecified, it is passed to the shell for execution via the shell's -c option. If no \ncommand is specified, an interactive shell is executed.\n\nThis avoids the already mentioned security drawbacks, and allows to \"go root\" by using the following command:\nsudo -s\n\nIF I really have to run a root shell (in most cases I don't), then I find it very helpful to have the HOME environment variable of the shell set accordingly (to reflect running as \"root\"), this can be done using the \"-H\" flag. So the full command would be\nsudo -s -H\n\nYou can find a lot more details in sudo's man-page.\n\nA: You can do this too:\nsudo -S <<< \"password\" command\n\n\nA: Instead of removing the password altogether, you can increase the timeout so you only have to type it a few times per day; in a terminal, run:\nsudo visudo\n\nAt the end of the file, add following line to set a timeout of 30 minutes (replace jsmith with your username).\nDefaults:jsmith timestamp_timeout=30\n\nYou can use any number you want; -1 means no timeout (prompted only the first time), and 0 means instant timeout (prompted every time you sudo). The default timeout is 5 minutes.\n\nA: In terminal run the visudo command to edit the sudoers file:\nsudo visudo\n\nand add the following line to the sudoers list\nusername ALL = NOPASSWD : ALL\n\nNote: Replace username with your real UserName in above line.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use secret-tool to lookup existing seahorse passwords? I found this post about getting passwords from the gnome keyring from commandline (How do I get passwords from the keyring in the terminal for usage in scripts?), and I found that secret-tool is the way to go. It's great that I can store passwords with secret-tool, but I can't seem to figure out how to lookup existing passwords that were stored using seahorse, which is what I'm really hoping to do. I don't know what attribute(s) and value(s) I would need to use to query them, and the man page is fairly vague on what these could possibly be.\n\nA: I made a utility, lssecret, that lists all items using libsecret, including all GNOME Keyring items. It looks like libsecret automatically adds a key value pair for every item, but Seahorse doesn't show them in the GUI. Here's some example output from lssecret:\nCollection: Login\n\nItem:   Test Password\nSecret: Tr0ub4dor&3\nKey:    xdg:schema\nValue:  org.gnome.keyring.Note\n\nItem:   secret-tool item\nSecret: s3cret-t00l\nKey:    my key\nValue:  my value\nKey:    xdg:schema\nValue:  org.freedesktop.Secret.Generic\n\nItem:   Unlock password for: cueball@xkcd.com\nSecret: correct horse battery staple\nKey:    unique\nValue:  ssh-store:/home/cueball/.ssh/id_rsa\nKey:    xdg:schema\nValue:  org.freedesktop.Secret.Generic\n\nItem:   Network secret for GenericSSID/802-1x/password\nSecret: S3cureW1f1Passw0rd\nKey:    setting-name\nValue:  802-1x\nKey:    connection-uuid\nValue:  6a762552-04b3-cd05-45ba-586688e0a029 \nKey:    xdg:schema\nValue:  org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Connection\nKey:    setting-key\nValue:  password\n\n\nGNOME Keyring stores each keyring as a collection in the secret service. You can see the default keyring, Login, in the output. The items represent:\n\n\n*\n\n*A password added to the keyring using seahorse. The description is \"Test  Password\" and the actual password is \"Tr0ub4dor&3\".\n\n*An item added using the command secret-tool store --label=\"secret-tool item\" \"my key\" \"my value\", then typing \"s3cret-t00l\" into the prompt.\n\n*A password for an ssh key so it can be automatically unlocked by gnome keyring. It was added using ssh-add from the command line, then checking the \"Automatically unlock this key at login\" box when it was first used.\n\n*A wifi network password added by selecting \"Store the password only for this user\" in the NetworkManager connection editor.\n\n\nAs you can see, passwords added to a keyring using Seahorse have a key value pair of \"xdg:schema\" and \"org.gnome.keyring.Note\". You can list them all using secret-tool search --all xdg:schema org.gnome.keyring.Note.\n\nA: Okay after investigating a little further, it looks like seahorse doesn't assign any attributes to Stored Passwords (I'm pretty sure secret-tool can't find a password without any attributes to lookup). The reason I believe this is the case is that, after creating one in seahorse, I look at the properties->details and there are no details (ie attributes). I've found others in seahorse, though, that have details, and I'm able to look them up in secret-tool using those attributes.\nThe solution, it seems, is to create the password using secret-tool, assigning the appropriate attributes for a unique lookup later. Since they both use gnome-keyring in the background, the new password appears in seahorse the moment you create it in secret-tool. \nGnome-keyring seems more than happy to create more than one password with the exact same label (just not the exact same attributes, it will replace it if they are exactly the same), so once you've recreated it, you can just delete the old useless one from seahorse.\n$ secret-tool store --label=DomainPassword user sjohnson domain some.domain\nPassword: thisismypa$$w0rd\n$ secret-tool lookup user sjohnson domain some.domain\nthisismypa$$w0rd\n\nThe reason I initially didn't want to store a password using secret-tool was that I didn't know how to get it to be a Login password (available upon login) through secret-tool. It looks like, as long as \"Login\" is your default keystore, secret-tool will store it there.\n\nA: I have tested it right now and I can recover my password with these arguments:\nsecret-tool lookup server \"ownCloud\"\n\nA: Based on Salims answer, I build a clumsy bash script:\noutFile=\"keyRingExport.csv\"\n\n# Get all secrets from keyring\nitems=`secret-tool search --all xdg:schema org.gnome.keyring.Note`\n\n# Clean exsisiting file\necho \"\">\"$outFile\"\ncurrentPath=\"none\"\ncurrentLabel=\"none\"\ncurrentSecret=\"none\"\n\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n  if [[ $line == \"[\"* ]]; then\n      # Trim Path\n        currentPath=${line/\\/org\\/freedesktop\\/secrets\\/collection\\//\"\"}\n  fi\n  if [[ $line == \"label\"* ]]; then\n      # Trim lable\n      currentLabel=${line/label = /\"\"}\n      # CSV escape\n      currentLabel=\"\\\"${currentLabel//\\\"/\"\\\"\\\"\"}\\\"\"\n  fi\n  if [[ $line == \"secret\"* ]]; then\n      # Trim secret\n      currentSecret=${line/secret = /\"\"}\n      # CSV escape\n      currentSecret=\"\\\"${currentSecret//\\\"/\"\\\"\\\"\"}\\\"\"\n      # write to file\n      echo \"$currentPath,$currentLabel,$currentSecret\" >> \"$outFile\"\n\n      # reset current variables\n      currentPath=\"none\"\n      currentLabel=\"none\"\n      currentSecret=\"none\"\n  fi\n\ndone <<< \"$items\"\n\n", "Q: How do I get the touchpad working on an Asus x450L? I've been using Ubuntu for a couple of weeks now and have been surviving without my touchpad.\nI have Asus x450L laptop. Are there drivers available so my trackpad will function again? \nIt works on windows 8.1 but not on Ubuntu. I tried reinstalling the synaptics and all sorts of things.\n\nA: Work Around\nCredit to Hans De Goede  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1314198/comments/31)\nThis should enable the mouse to work as a normal touchpad mouse, so no multi-touch.\nYou need to add a Kernel Boot Parameter to set the flag psmouse.proto=bare which will enable PS/2 Mouse Emulation mode on your touchpad.\nTo do this you can edit your default grub file.\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\nFind the line that mentions GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" (or something similar) and add the flag to the end of the quoted string.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash psmouse.proto=bare\"\nThen save the file and run a grub update.\nsudo update-grub\nThen restart the system and (hopefully) enjoy your new touchpad in PS/2 Emulation Mode.\nThis is a temporary fix as Hans De Goede mentions, this isn't a trivial fix. If I'm reading the situation correctly, support for the software that handled the touchpad used in the ASUS 550 range (and some other models) was deprecated in 14.04 and a suitable replacement hasn't yet been developed. So for now we don't get multi-touch in 14.04.\nHaving struggled with this for a while and finding nothing but launchpad bug reports, I'm pretty happy to finally have a working touchpad even if it doesn't have multi-touch!\n\nA: There's no solution right now.\nI've made a blog post to summarize everything I know on this subject: Asus touchpad not detected under Ubuntu Linux. This bug affects at least Asus X450CC, X455LA, X550CA, X550LB, X550LC, X550LD, X750LB.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

A program called python-netifaces (0.8-3build1, automatic) installed without my installing it. \nI was trying to install gufw on a standard account on a fully up to date, newly-installed Ubuntu 14.04. \nAnyone know if this is abnormal or it's just supposed to be there even though I didn't explicitly install it?\n\nA: Packages (programs) often require other programs to be installed in order for them to work. These other packages are called dependencies, because the first program depends on them being installed.\nWhen you install a package, the dependencies will also be installed. This process is hidden from you when using the Software Center.\nIf you would like to know about the dependencies that will be installed, you can use the command line.\nFor example:\nsudo apt-get install gufw\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\npython-netifaces\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\ngufw python-netifaces\nNeed to get 482 kB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 2,607 kB of additional disk space will be used.\nDo you want to continue? [Y/n] \n\nYou can then choose to cancel the installation if for some reason you do not wish to install the dependencies.\nOther ways to look into the dependencies include:\napt-cache show gufw\nDepends: python:any (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2), ufw (>= 0.31.1), gir1.2-gtk-3.0, policykit-1, gnome-icon-theme-symbolic, python-netifaces, gir1.2-webkit-3.0\n\nNote that apt-cache shows all of the dependencies, while apt-get only shows the dependencies that are not yet installed.\nYou can also use the Ubuntu package database . See the results page for gufw .\n\nA: You installed gufw , which has python-netifaces as a dependecy.\n\"Dependecies\", as their name says, are package that are needed by another for it to work. You'll notice that if you try yo remove python-netifaces, gufw will uninstall itself at the same time. \nFrom Linux Dictionnary : \n\nDefinition: dependencies: The proper functionality of one package may rely on the existence of another package, meaning there is a dependency [...] \n\nFrom the wiki. :\n\nWhen you install a program, its dependencies must be installed at the same time. Usually, most of the required dependencies will already be installed, but a few extras may be needed, too. So, when you install a package, don't be surprised if several other packages are installed too - these are just dependencies which are needed for your chosen package to function properly. \n\nThat's how Linux works. \n", "Q: MATLAB won't open after fresh installation!

How can I echo the contents in mutt when I use root account?\n\nA: First of all, have you checked your root's mutt configuration is working? You're getting some emails so it probably is fine but humour me with:\necho \"foo bar\" | sudo mutt mymail@mymail.com\n\nIf that's all okay, then it's probably just a syntax issue in the script. When piping things you have to be careful that it's not being interpreted by something else. The easiest way to do this is to wrap the command inside another shell instance:\nsh -c 'echo \"foo bar\" | mutt mymail@mymail.com'\n\nThat should ensure the pipe stays with the mutt.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 DVD Stuck I downloaded Ubuntu Desktop to a DVD, restarted the PC with the DVD in the drawer, as instructed, the desktop came up with the Keyboard Shortcuts on the monitor and won't go anywhere.

Both computers have ext4 file systems installed.\nI decided to test Unison before using it for critical syncing since I had a previous experience with Windows to Windows syncing program that was barely usable (as in slow, unstable, and God help you if the network went down). I tested all those faults with Unison and it passed by a wide margin.\nI have a significant problem with Unison ignore = Path. I set the ignore using the GUI and editing the profile file. When a folder or file gets added inside the last folder in the path, Unison wants to add the new stuff to the opposite computer from where it was added. So ignore does work according to the definition in the Unison documentation:\n\nignore xxx\nIncluding the preference -ignore pathspec causes Unison to completely ignore paths that match pathspec (as well as their children). This is useful for avoiding synchronizing temporary files, object files, etc. The syntax of pathspec is described in the Path Specification section, and further details on ignoring paths is found in the Ignoring Paths section.\n\nWhat I seeing in my test counter to “(as well as their children)”. I was hoping ignore = Path meant no matter what always ignore every change in that path.\nHere is a copy of my working test unison profile:\nlabel = test2\nroot = /home/butest/Documents\nroot = ssh://butest@169.254.8.108//home/butest/Documents\nsshargs = -C  \nignore = Path Documents/4_Significant_Events/*\n\nHere is a list of the ignore = Path combination I've tried with no success. They either throw an exception or had the same behavior as above.\nignore = Path home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events\n\nignore = Path /home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events\n\nignore = Path //home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events/\n\nignore = Path {home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events}\n\nignore = Path {/home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events}\n\nignore = Path {//home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events/}\n\nignore = Path home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events*\n\nignore = Path /home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events*\n\nignore = Path //home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events*/\n\nignore = Path {home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events*}\n\nignore = Path {/home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events*}\n\nignore = Path {//home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events/*}\n\nignore = Path home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events[*]\n\nignore = Path /home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events[*]\n\nignore = Path //home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events/[*]\n\nignore = Path {home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events[*]}\n\nignore = Path {/home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events[*]}\n\nignore = Path {//home/butest/Document/4_Significant_Events/[*]}\n\nAlso I was hoping to keep the time stamp the same on both computers. But I can't figure out how to force it. This minor compared to the other problem.\n\nA: Let's see: ignore paths are relative. So all the additional examples you checked are illegal. \nIn this code: \nlabel = test2\nroot = /home/butest/Documents\nroot = ssh://butest@169.254.8.108//home/butest/Documents\nsshargs = -C  \nignore = Path Documents/4_Significant_Events/*\n\nyou are telling Unison to ignore all the paths under the roots that match the description, that is, \n/home/butest/Documents/Documents/4_Significant_Events/*\n\nwhich I suspect is not what you want. If you want that your directory /home/butest/Documents/4_Significant_Events/ (and children) be ignored, simply change the last line with \nignore = Path {4_Significant_Events}\n\nAbout the timestamp thing, I do not understand. Are you looking for times = true option to sync timestamps?\n\nA: ignore = Path {4_Significant_Events}\n\nWorks Perfect.\nAre the {} similar to scope in C?\nSo the above line could be stated as:\nunison  ignore all the stuff in the scope of  4_Significant_Events.\ntimes = true \n\nwas what I needed, I was looking for it in the GUI as “time stamp”\nWorks Perfect. \n", "Q: How can I change calender to Persian calender (like in KDE)?

I've searched for it but onyl found a package jcal which is useable in CLI mode, or jalali-calendar which is for Ubuntu 10.04.\nHow to change the Ubuntu calendar to Persian calendar?\n\nA: Fortunately, It's very simple.

I think the options beneath allow you to edit the boot parameters.

The boot partition is a sacred place. It wasn't always set up in this manner though. By placing that data on its own partition, it added another dynamic of protection in case data loss occurred; however people still persist to have problems keeping their boot environment from getting hit.\nLinux is unforgiving. But you can recover your data by using an install disc to get into an environment and mount your partitions. There is also a method of recovery along that same path if you get crafty. Search for a recovery tutorial and the solution will present itself.\nIf you're really serious about recovering the partition, you could use deep scan recovery software to recover the data, but I assure you it's more trouble than it's worth.\n", "Q: sata to usb reader issues I have 2 laptops that are each running 10.04.

I have 12.04 and I'm looking for a way to store all the currently installed packages names into a file or archive. Not the packages themselves, but the names. Or the package management's state.\nI'd like to do this in order for the ability to synchronize the installed packages on demand on two computers. The idea would be to save the installed names on computer A, go to computer B, make a diff of the names and uninstall extra packages from B and install the missing ones.\nFor this it would be good if the version could also be saved for each package. Also I'm not sticking to the names if there is something that better suits my scenario, something that the package management can work with as automatic as it can be.\nOut of preference, I'd like to do it without the use of a sync-server. Looking for file-based solutions.\n\nA: This command will give you all the installed packages and their respective versions:\ndpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package}\\t${Version}\\n'\n\nOr even shorter (the above command is the default output for -W):\ndpkg-query -W\n\nSee dpkg-query man pages for further format options.\nTo backup and restore your packages, please see this answer.\n\nA: You could also run the below command to list the installed packages along with their versions.\ndpkg -l | awk '{print $2,$3}'\n\n", "Q: Thumbnails in Nautilus visible only on click On my 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04, Nautilus shows me the thumbnails of .png files only when i select(single click) on the file.

I can see that the thumbnails are being generated in ~/.cache/thumbnails/large whenever i open my png folder in nautilus. So why is Nautilus not showing the thmbnails?\nThe owner and group of the cache folder is faizal:faizal. The permissions are drwx------.\nEdit : The behaviour seems inconsistent now after a couple of days(and restarts). The thumbnails mostly show now, but at times it is blank.\n\nA: Go to Edit->Preferences and select the Preview tab.  Increase the \"Only for files smaller than\" size to a value larger than the size of your file(s).\n\nA: if You uninstalled Totem player then just install it again (even if You are not using it). If You have it already installed, then I would suggest to reinstall it. After that check if thumbnails are working, if not check:\n/usr/share/thumbnailers/totem.thumbnailer\n\nit should contain something like this:\n[Thumbnailer Entry]\nTryExec=/usr/bin/totem-video-thumbnailer\nExec=/usr/bin/totem-video-thumbnailer -s %s %u %o\nMimeType=application/mxf;application/ogg;application/ram;application/sdp;applic$\n\nif the file is not present or is emty then just paste above code.\nI also chowned /.cache/thumbnails/ to my user like in Kristofers solution & have libxine1-ffmpeg in the newest version.\nHope my solution work for You.\n\nA: For me the problem was that the ~/.cache/thumbnails folder had changed ownership to root for some reason.

Is there a trimmed down version of Windows I could use or something like that? I'd like to stay away from Pirate Bay and downloading illegal copies of Windows.\nThanks!\n\nA: Check the HP from Wine:\nWine Adobe Photoshop\nMany People tried to use CS2 because there is a official free download version on the hp from adobe. (Tricky to find) The only acceptable Version that works is 7.0\n\nA: You could use an alternative program like GIMP. GIMP is usually packaged with Ubuntu full. GIMP does take some getting used to. For features that GIMP lacks, I'm pretty sure you could find extensions for it that does what you want it to do.\nTry running it on Crossover, which is basically Wine but proprietary.\nAnd then there's always VMs. Boot up a Windows VM and do what you need to do. But then, you aren't exactly running Photoshop on Ubuntu. But then again, you can get your work done fast enough.\nI don't know if there is a lite version for Windows (except the ones that are put out by modders) but you can get Windows 10 Home for free from Microsoft's Official site if you can get access to some Windows machine using the Media Creation Tool. You can read more about how to create installation media for another computer on there. You won't be asked for an activation key. It'll have that Activation watermark and there are some restrictions on customizing your desktop, but if you are running it under a VM, I don't think that's going to be a problem.

Google has updated its Chrome browser to version 35. This new version uses Aura in place of GTK2 and no longer supports NPAPI plugins like Java (both OpenJDK and Oracle). PPAPI plugins like PepperFlash still work. \nMy school uses Google Chrome and Google apps every day and this looks like a potentially big problem for some of the educational websites we use. Has anyone run into a solution or workaround to get Java working?\nThis WEB UPD8 article confirms that Java does not work. \n\nA: You cannot get Java to work on Chrome 35. Its because of the removal of the older plugin NPAPI. \nI have raised a bug report. Awaiting a proper response from the devs. \nThe bug report is here: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=375909. \nYou can try and follow the thread for this discussion here: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-dev/xEbgvWE7wMk\nUPDATE\nLooks like we are going to be stuck here for quite a while. My bug report was merged into the parent bug and it's been set as won't fix. Here it is : https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=363053\nUPDATE2\nA relevant question was posted to Oracle. Not much traction. You guys can start a discussion on that thread. Go here: https://community.oracle.com/thread/3511913\nTo all of you: To keep Chrome functioning, please downgrade your GOogle Chrome to 34. You can download the deb here: http://mirror.pcbeta.com/google/chrome/deb/pool/main/g/google-chrome-stable/.\nThen use synaptic package manager or use the commandline to lock upgrades for google-chrome-stable package. Chrome 34 doesn't have any glaring bugs, so you can use it safely for the next 3 months. I am hoping by that time some patch will be added.\n\nA: You CAN get Java to work on Chrome, or at least enable the NPAPI plug-in for it... temporarily. The option is being removed altogether in Chrome 45. (Currently we are at 43, estimate is September 2015.)\nNote that enabling NPAPI doesn't necessarily mean the Java Applet will work...

Same Ubuntu 13.10 32 & 64 bit versions too.\n\nA: Linux (and therefore Ubuntu) is only limited to the physical architecture of the CPU, chipset, buses, and peripherals.\n32-bit Ubuntu (which uses Physical Address Extension mode via Linux's CONFIG_X86_PAE) can use 64GB of RAM (though limited to 4GB virtual memory per process). 64-bit Ubuntu has no addressing limits, so depending on the CPU and chipset, this could be up to 256 TB (for the current generation of 48-bit physical memory CPUs). Most systems will be limited by their chipset and RAM sockets.\nFor more details, see Larger physical address space.\nHard drive size again depends on the hardware, not Ubuntu. The standard filesystem, ext4, can address up to 1 exbibyte.\n\nA: 32bit RAM is 4G addressable\n64bit RAM is  16.8 million terabytes\nHard drive space is harder as it depends on file system, hardware and the like.

Both are primarily Windows applications, but the site has some guidance on creating the same USB device via Linux.\nIt writes many popular GNU/Linux (and other) distros to a USB device with a Live boot configuration. Ubuntu support is pretty mature. I am not experienced with running a Live server using it, but I imagine it is possible.\nIf you have a Linux system, you could also just write the .ISO to the USB via:\n# dd if=ubuntu-server.iso of=/dev/path/to/USB\nalthough this may not create a usable Live device.

When I check the System profiler and Benchmark application it gives me incorrect cpu speeds and the speeds tend to vary every time I run the application. Ranging from 1900 to 3900 (3900MHz is what I would expect it to say every time).\n\nWhat do these values indicate? Was I wrong to expect the maximum speed?\n\nA: The CPU is clocked down if it is not used to save power. So there is nothing wrong with the tool It just shows the actual CPU frequency.\nYou could try to run:\nopenssl speed\nThen you would see the first core to show 3900 Mhz in the System profiler and Benchmark application.\nThe reason for this is that openssl is only using one core.\nYou would need a benchmark which uses multiple cores so that all cores show 3900 Mhz.\nIf you want more infos on your CPU, run:\ncat /proc/cpuinfo\n", "Q: Connect to only one specific wireless network if available?

To have a fresh installation I was told I need to format the partition it is on and simply re-install Ubuntu. I am currently on a live cd and was going to format it but apparently its mounted so I can't format it.\nI'm not sure what to do and I would like Ubuntu back with out screwing something up. Btw I dual-booted it so I would also like to do this without screwing up the Windows partition.\nscreenshot of gparted:\n\nLspci:\n\n\nA: to unmount your partition\n\n\n*\n\n*open gparted \n\n*right click the partition you want to unmount \n\n*select the unmount option\n\n\n\n\nA: You should not need to do any formatting ahead of time. If your dual boot configuration is working properly, you should be able to boot the system from your installation media (CD or USB device).\nBackup any data you may want, if you can, before proceeding. You could lose it otherwise.\nYou can choose either 'Try Ubuntu' or 'Install Ubuntu' which then would need you to click the Install icon from the desktop.\nOnce the basic install process begins, it should scan the system drives and ask you if you want to replace the identified operating systems, replace everything, etc.\nChoose the option to replace the previous Ubuntu installation.\nThat should reinstall ubuntu clean over the previous instance without touching the Windows partition(s).\n\nA: First, see what's mounted:\n$ mount\n\nIdentify which of those is your current existing Ubuntu partition, and then unmount it. For example:\n$ sudo umount /dev/sda2\n\nThen if you like, you can run mount again to verify it's no longer mounted. You may get errors about the filesystem being in use, in which case, first make sure that you aren't in a directory on that filesystem, and that you aren't editing or using any files or applications there. If you still have troubles, you can use lsof to see what files are currently in use, and by what processes.\n\nA: what i usually do is boot in windows from there i format the ubuntu spaces and make them one with disk D or C or E or F or whatever it made for the dual install and reboot and install ubuntu sorry for my sucky english\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Gparted and expand the /dev/sda4 partition.\n\n*Select the /dev/sda6 partition, click the \"Partition\" menu dropdown, and select 'Delete'\n\n*Repeat step 2 for the /dev/sda5 partition\n\n*Now repeat step 2 for the /dev/sda4 partition (it should now allow you to delete it, now that this Extended Partition is empty.)\n\n*Exit gparted (it will probably ask you to confirm you want to write the changes to disk.

So if have more that 10 icon what should I do?\n\nA: Place your mouse pointer at the lower end of the bar and the icons will scroll up allowing you to choose the one you desire. You can also unlock rarely used icons from the launcher.\n\nA: This only applies for the first nine (not ten) icons. This is because those are the numerical keys available on the keyboard. You can only use Super + 1 to 9 on the first nine apps.\nYou can try reorganizing your apps and place the one's you use mostly on top nine and the others after them. I pretty much use like six apps at most - browser, text editor, terminal, media player, gimp (occasionally) and sometimes BibleTime.\nYou can also unlock those apps you rarely use or which doesn't require 'launching' as per say. Take a look at the pdf reader, evince, you don't really need that on the launcher. Just select your PDF and double click it. Something like the image viewer, you don't really need that on the launcher either.

So I found this link and ran the following command\nsudo chsh -s $(which zsh) john\n\nwhere john is my user.\nIt all worked fine until I tried accessing my bank's website and noticed that the symbolic link I had created for the Java Chrome Plugin didn't work anymore.\nI tried deleting it and creating a new one via zsh with this command:\nsudo ln -s /opt/jre1.7.0_55/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so\n\nbut it didn't work. Should I do something different now that I'm using zsh? How do I get my symbolic links working again?\n\nA: Without clarification about the errors that your browser is experiencing, I can only speculate, but here goes:\nIt seems entirely likely that your ~/.bashrc was setting certain environment variables and exporting them. When you then would invoke zsh manually, it would (as a child process of your bash shell) inherit those environment variables.\nIt would behoove you to investigate precisely which environment variables are being set when your initial bash session is started, before switching to zsh.\nTo do this, first invoke bash:\n$ bash\n\nThen examine your environment variables:\n$ set\n\nThis output will be long. You may wish to pipe through a pager like more or less. Because you are experiencing problems with java, you may wish to verify that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is properly set in zsh.\nFrom bash, do:\n$ echo $JAVA_HOME\n\nThen exit from that bash session and verify that JAVA_HOME is correctly set in zsh by issuing the same echo command again.\nIf these do not match, you'll want to set it in your ~/.zshrc which you can do very easily by going back into bash and then echoing the variable contents into your .zshrc like this:\n$ bash\n$ echo \"export JAVA_HOME=\" $JAVA_HOME >> .zshrc\n$ exit\n\n\nA: First of all, there is absolutely no reason to run chsh with sudo! Next time, just run\nchsh -s $(which bash) \n\nThere is also absolutely no reason to use sudo ln. Links are world read/write/executable by every one. Now, the links you have created have nothing to do with the shell you sued. There is absolutely no reason why changing your shell would affect them. If you can't access a link, the problem is elsewhere.\nAnyway, just run \nln -s /opt/jre1.7.0_55/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so\n\nThat will create a link called libnpjp2.so which will be in your current directory and point to /opt/jre1.7.0_55/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so. I very much doubt that's what you want to do but that's what you seem to be asking for.\nIf for whatever reason the commands above don't work. please edit your question and tell us precisely how they failed. A simple \"did not work\" is not very useful. Were there any error messages? Is a broken link created? What went wrong?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 - Virtual Surround Sound?

It will look like nothing happened but, if you try to close\nthe terminal you'll be prompted with something like :\nThere is still a process running in this terminal. Closing the\nterminal will kill it.\nThat process, it's bash. It will read your command like your other\nshell without any issue because your first shell is already, most\nprobably, running bash too. It's just an example. There are other shells and you can find out about them here : [Reviewer, insert link 1 here]\nWhen you'll be done, you may want to type exit to close it.\n\n*| is the character used to represent pipes. M. Jackson explains what they are here : http://www.dsj.net/compedge/shellbasics1.html\n\nPipes. UNIX philosophy urges the use of small yet highly focused programs that can be used together to perform complex tasks. So, learning how to string together a number of small commands on the commandline is an intrinsic part of being comfortable with Bash. To do this, we direct the standard output of one program into the standard input of another program, but we don't use redirectors, we use the pipe operator, ``|''. In UNIX, processes connected by pipes run together dynamically as data flows between them.\n\n\n*And tee, for the sake of completeness : [Reviewer, insert link 2 here]\n\n\n[reads] from standard input and write to standard output and files\n  \n  This means that the output of bash (more precisely the output of the commands run inside it) will be handed to tee as its input. Effectively removing the need of using | tee /abc.txt after each of your commands to see their output on the shell as well as saving it on your file system.\n\n\nA: One option is to use the script program\nNAME\n     script — make typescript of terminal session\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     script [-a] [-c command] [-e] [-f] [-q] [-t[=file]] [-V] [-h] [file]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     script makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is\n     useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session\n     as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out\n     later with lpr(1).\n\nNote however that script saves everything in the terminal (rather than just command output) - including ANSI color sequences, which can make it difficult to extract plain text from the resulting file in the case of color terminals.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThe following is just an idea, there may be gotchas that I'm not aware of associated with using it\nSimilar to @MomentumMori's suggestion of spawning a tee-d bash subshell, if you want to get fancy with redirections you could probably do something like\nexec 3>&1\n\nto save the current standard output file descriptor, then\nexec 1> >(tee -a outfile)\n\nFrom this point on, standard output gets redirected to a tee sub process that appends everything to outfile. Because we haven't redirected the subprocess's output stream, a copy of the command output still appears in the terminal as well.\nOnce you're done with the commands whose output you want to capture, you can reverse the redirect and close the temporary file descriptor\nexec 1>&3 3>&-\n\nafter which you can look in outfile to see the outputs of the commands\ncat outfile\n\n\nA: No.\nThis has to do with how the sockets called \"standard input\" and \"standard output\" work, and with the overall Unix/Linux toolchain philosophy of \"Do One Thing and Do It Well.\" You may wish to take a minute or two to understand http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/io-redirection.html \"IO Redirection in Bash\"\nAll of that having been said, you could write a script to wrap commands with that redirection, but it still doesn't save you very many keystrokes.\n", "Q: How can I set up an automatic core dump in an Upstart script? myapp is an application that crashes eventually.

What are the differences between symbolic links in Ubuntu and Windows shortcuts? Are they analogous concepts? Or is there something in Ubuntu that resembles more Windows shortcuts?\n\nA: Yes and no.\nIn order to understand the vagaries here, you need to understand the relationship between the inode table, and data written to disk.\nWindows shortcuts are path data contained in regular files. Think of them like text files which only contain a URI for a file. From Wikipedia:\n\nShortcuts are treated like ordinary files by the file system and by software programs that are not aware of them. Only software programs that understand shortcuts (such as the Windows shell and file browsers) treat them as references to other files.\nAnother difference are the capabilities of the mechanism:\nMicrosoft Windows shortcuts normally refer to a destination by an absolute path (starting from the root directory), whereas POSIX symbolic links can refer to destinations via either an absolute or a relative path. The latter is useful if both the location and destination of the symbolic link share a common path prefix, but that prefix is not yet known when the symbolic link is created (e.g., in an archive file that can be unpacked anywhere).\nMicrosoft Windows application shortcuts contain additional metadata that can be associated with the destination, whereas POSIX symbolic links are just strings that will be interpreted as absolute or relative pathnames.\n\nWindows Vista, 7 and 8 also support symbolic links natively under NTFS\nPOSIX-Compliant symbolic links are not files. Instead, they are entries into the inode table which are automatically resolved by the file system. Any software program, upon accessing a symbolic link, will see the target instead, whether the program is aware of symbolic links or not.\n\nA: Symbolic links are much like Windows shortcuts.  They are like an alias that points to the real object in the filesystem.  If the object moves or is deleted, the link becomes broken.\nBoth windows and Linux have hard links, which are very different.  I haven't used Windows since XP, and at that time, there was no UI for hard links, but there was an API, and an app could create a hard link (it could also be done by a user using Cygwin).\nA hard link is another full-fledged object in the file system.  You can have multiple links, and all of them act the same.  They all point to the same storage, though.  If you delete one, and the other will still exisst, the storage will not be deleted until you delete all the links.\n\nA: Without getting into the technical details under the hood:\nWindows shortcuts are \"regular files\" like a text file, or a picture file. Most all programs on a Windows computer will simply see a file named whatever.lnk and won't know what to do with it. They are generally only treated specially by your file browser.\nLinux symbolic links are \"special files\" which look and act just like a folder to nearly every program and not just the file browser.\nI personally take advantage of symbolic links all the time to trick programs into saving data in other locations. For example, if I know a game stores save files under the hidden directory /home/UserName/.game/some/sub/folder/saves I could cut that saves folder out and paste it into my own regularly backed up data folder /home/UserName/Gaming, rename it to whatever I want, then make a symbolic link to it called saves and put that back where I found the original folder. The game won't know anything happened.\n", "Q: Yo Frankie game not working I have installed Yo Frankie game on 14.04 LTS. When I open the game it shows some clouds moving on the screen. No menu appears. What should I do?\n\nA: I've been unable to get it to work following the directions in the README so what I did was navigated to where I extracted the files, opened the yofrankie-win32 folder right-clicked on the highlighted file and chose Open With A Wine Application. \n\nSome light research indicates that the inability to use the directions in the README may be a blender bug. This part I have not confirmed. However the instructions outlined above do work.\n\nA: There is a bug in the Ubuntu package.

It does not recognize the wireless network card. I'm new on linux. Someone can tell me where can I download. Thank you\n\nA: I was having the same problem (same laptop, but Xubuntu 14.04.2) and this article solved my problem:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/60395/382462\n", "Q: I installed a custom .deb file that provided a package named \"python\" but now need to remove it I think I may have botched my system. I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my computer.\nOne of the first things I did was install python 3.3 from source (using make altinstall); but then I realized that python 3.4 is already native in Ubuntu 14.04 and decided to remove the python 3.3 installation. To do that, I followed the instructions on this post.\nUnfortunately, only too late did I realize that this resulted in the creation a .deb file containing a package named \"python\", which was subsequently installed. This had the effect of completely mangling my package system. Any attempt to use apt-get produces many dependency errors like the one below:\nmercurial : Depends: python (>= 2.7) but it is not going to be installed\n            Depends: python (< 2.8) but it is not going to be installed\n\nI tried to remove the custom package by running dpkg -r python_3.3.5-1_amd64.deb but it says that I need to remove by the name of the package, not the name of the file. And running dpkg -r python also fails:\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent removal of python:\n python-ubuntu-sso-client depends on python (>= 2.7).\n python-ubuntu-sso-client depends on python (<< 2.8).\n ...\n\nThe first solution I came up with was to completely re-install Ubuntu, but before I go ahead with that drastic solution, is there any way I can undo the effects of installing this custom \"python\" package?\nCan I somehow use the .deb file to remove the package from the system (e.g. by removing the file sit provides and then resolving the dependencies by hand)? Or did this \"python\"-named package mess up the packages beyond hope of recovery?\n\nA: I think I have found the answer. I downloaded the real \"python\" package from Ubuntu Packages and installed it:\ncd /tmp\nwget http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/python-defaults/python_2.7.5-5ubuntu3_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i python_2.7.5-5ubuntu3_amd64.deb\n\nTo complete the whole process, I ended up recreating my custom .deb file (with python3.3) with a new non-clashing name (\"python-to-remove\"), and then installed and uninstalled it:\nsudo dpkg -i python-to-remove_3.3.5-1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -r python-to-remove\n\nThis removed all the files from this package, while the files from other packages seem to not have been affected. I ended up deleting a bunch of documentation files as well, but I had never used them before, so I think I'm OK with that.\n\nA: Try to do what dpkg ask you, I mean:\ndpkg -r python_3.3.5-1\n\nUse the package name, not the file one.\nThis is quite a wild shot, so feel free to downvote it if it doesn't work.\n\nA: python is by far one of the most important packages to Ubuntu. DO NOT TRY TO REMOVE IT!!! YOUR COMPUTER WILL NOT RUN PROPERLY AT ALL!!! You must reinstall ubuntu. Besides, you would not need to remove the python package anyway, why would you? It is impossible anyway.\n", "Q: How do I redirect input from one sound card to output on another sound card? I have a TV card with its sound output connected to the CD-in of my mainboard's built-in sound card. There is also a USB sound device connected to my machine. Now I want to play the sound from the TV card via the USB sound output.\nI tried the solutions proposed in How do I output my audio input? but they don't work for me. When I run those commands all I get is a lot of low frequency feedback that quickly adds up so that I need to terminate the command after a few seconds.\nThe reasons for this seems to be that the input source selected in pavucontrol for my internal sound card is my microphone. However, the CD input does not show up in pavucontrol, it only shows up in alsamixer.\nIs there something that I am missing here? How can I play my CD-in from my internal sound card via my USB sound device?\n\nA: After some fiddling, I managed to get my CD input recognized by ALSA, see my answer on the other question. Now it shows up in alsamixer.\nI ended up using the solution provided in this answer. I created a script in my home directory which contains the following code:\npacat -r --device=alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo | pacat -p --latency-msec=1\nWhile this is running, sound input from the input device selected in alsamixer (press F4 to switch to input controls) is redirected to my USB audio device. Unfortunately, the input device is reset whenever I lock my screen so I have to change it back to my CD-in repeatedly.

I mount the share and it seems to work fine for a uncertain amount of time. I can do ls or run du on folders within the mounted share. Then I will go to tab out a folder path and my console locks up. I can start a new session but it will lock as soon as I try to mess with the mounted share; this even happens to other users if I have them try as well. I have no idea why this is happening? I've never seen this issue.\n\nA: This has to do with both the way bash completion works and the way cifs works as a protocol.\nbash completion works thusly:\n\n\n*\n\n*readline informs bash of the currently-typed string, and of the tab keystroke.\n\n*bash performs a Depth First Searchof the filesystem, the root of which is at the most-matched part of the filesystem hierarchy. Each step of this search is actually many requests - a request for a list - from the filesystem.\n\n*readline blocks - waiting for a response from bash with a list of possible outcomes to display.\n\n*that list arrives, readline displays it, and returns input control to the user.\n\n\nOn a blocklevel or local or otherwise reasonably-fast filesystem, this all happens incredibly quickly.\nCIFS, unfortunately, isn't a blocklevel filesystem. Instead, CIFS is a command-based transactional protocol. Every single request made against CIFS is:\n\n\n*\n\n*transactional, requiring a request, acknowledgement, and acknowledgement of the acknowledgement,\n\n*represented by multiple individual CIFS/SMB command blocks\n\n*inspected for authentication\n\n\nIn short, CIFS/SMB is (at least in SMB1, which almost assuredly is what you're using to mount this CIFS share) extremely chatty.\nIn ordinary, direct usage of known filenames, the request is a singleton. You make the request for a file, CIFS authenticates you, acknowledges your request, you acknowledge their acknowledgement, and your file transfers.\nIn the case of tab-completion, that cycle is multiplied by the number of files in a particular directory, possibly times two (or more!) if it's dereferencing a Windows Shortcut.\nAll over the network.\nThis is a recipe for significant slowdowns as readline waits for bash who's in turn waiting for the filesystem driver to negotiate with the CIFS server.\nYou may wish to work around this problem by doing things like running your session from within screen, that way if your bash session locks up, you can ctrl-A-c and get s brand spanking new terminal, so you can continue to work or even kill the other one.\n", "Q: \"Files\" file manager utility 3.10.1, How do I uninstall it?

I want my computer to play a custom sound file when my battery is low (say 10%). How can I do this?\nThanks\n\nA: I just wanted to reply as I used the advice on this page for configuring my own crontab -e job.\nI'm running Lubuntu (trusty) and the above didn't work for me, but with a little tweaking it did. My level of (in)experience is that I'm relatively capable of reading basic scripts and commands but less able to write them from scratch in linux disto's. I mention that because if I can cobble together a working battery alarm, most of you reading this should be able to as well!\nSO.... the script and a basic explanation....\nAs per the posts above by Glutanimate and Scott Goodgame (thanks guys!), I basically did the following:\nTo get mpg123 and be able to play audio:\nsudo apt-get install acpi mpg123\n\nFile to open to write the command:\ncrontab -e\n\nCommand to enter at end of the file:\n*/1 * * * * if [ `acpi -b | awk ' { print ( $(NF-2)-0)}'`  -lt \"15\" ] ; then mpg123 /home/andy/Alarm.mp3 ; fi\n\n\nExplanation of the above\nAsterisks at the start\nThe five asterisks represent the frequency at which to run the commands. \n\n\n*\n\n*First star = Minutes: 0-59\n\n*Second star = Hours: 0-23 \n\n*Third star = Day of Month: 0 - 31 \n\n*Fourth star = Month: 0 - 12 \n\n*Fifth star = Day of Week: 0 - 6 (0 means Sunday)\n\n\n*/1 * * * *\nmeans 'run this every minute'.\nIF/THEN/FI:\nIF [ stuff inside these brackets ] ; THEN do something ; FI\n\nMost of you, I imagine, are very familiar with IF/THEN statements. \nThe FI at the end concludes the IF statement \nPlaying the audio:\nmpg123 /home/andy/Alarm.mp3\n\nthis simply uses mpg123 to play a file called Alarm.mp3 located in my home directory /home/andy/.\nOutput battery info:\nacpi -b\n\nthis simply outputs the battery status. On my laptop it yields results such as:\nBattery 0: Discharging, 74%, 02:35:18 remaining\n\nPipe to awk command\n | awk ' { print ( $(NF-2)-0)}'`  -lt \"15\"\n\nOkay, so we're piping the output of the battery status above and printing the second-from-the-end value (NF-2) which in the above example is '74%'. However, we need to remove the 'percentage' -0. We want to compare the current value with the value 15 -lt \"15\". So to sum it up in plain English, \n\nIF the value of the battery is LESS THAN 15% THEN play an audio file\n\nI appreciate I've dumbed it down somewhat and perhaps my explanation could be improved on, but hopefully it'll help someone else understand how to add an alarm for the battery and avoid their laptops from just powering off all of a sudden!\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT\nOkay... so it turns out that when my laptop is charging, the output of\nacpi -b\n\nis:\nBattery 0: Charging, 35%, 01:04:08 until charged\n\nwhereas on battery is \nBattery 0: Discharging, 36%, 01:22:36 remaining\n\nso using the parameter mentioned initially of\nprint ( $(NF-2)-0)\n\noutputs different results, because remember, the NF-value bit specifies how many items backwards from the end of the output to display, so with the output on battery of\nBattery 0: Discharging, 36%, 01:22:36 remaining\n\n$(NF-2) outputs '36%' whereas with the laptop on charge,\nBattery 0: Charging, 35%, 01:04:08 until charged\n\n$(NF-2) outputs '00:50:12', i.e. the amount of time remaining until charged.\nThe -0 after $(NF-2) minuses zero from the value, so when the value is a percent -0 changes it from something like '36%' to '36'. When the output value is perceived as non numerical, such as the time output of '01:04:08' as above, the value -0 returns is '0'. So you can see my issue - when my laptop is on charge, the output value is always '0'. Since I want to play an alarm when the output value is less than 15, it translates to a battery alarm that goes off every one minute when on charge!\nI read up a little more on the output of the awk command and it turns out I didn't need to make it read the second value from the end, I could start from the beginning of the output and skip forward. This is much better as my battery status begins the same whether it is on charge or on battery in terms of number of parameters, i.e. the fourth parameter from the beginning is always the value of charge in percent.\nSO... to make it read the fourth value, the command changes from\nawk ' { print ($(NF-2)-0)}'\n\nto\nawk ' { print ($4)-0}'\n\nor in its full glory:\n*/1 * * * * if [ `acpi -b | awk ' { print ($4)-0}'`  -lt \"15\" ] ; then mpg123 /home/andy/Alarm.mp3 ; fi\n\nAgain I hope that helps someone! Good luck and thanks for reading!\n\nBONUS EDIT\nOkay, so a little additional poking around and I also worked out how to set the volume to 100% and unmute before playing the alarm - because let's face it, what's the point of a battery alarm if you can't hear it because you've set the volume to low or muted it?!\nAnyway, the command you need is:\n*/1 * * * * if [ `acpi -b | awk ' { print ($4)-0}'`  -lt \"15\" ] ; then pactl set-sink-volume 0 100% && pactl set-sink-mute 0 0 && mpg123 /home/andy/Alarm.mp3 ; fi\n\nas you can see, all I've done is inserted the command string \npactl set-sink-volume 0 100% && pactl set-sink-mute 0 0 &&\n\n(the &&'s just bind multiple commands together)\nAgain, good luck all!\nLAST EDIT\nOkay, So... one final (hopefully!) edit... apparently, the percentage sign is a special sign when running cron tasks. Therefore, you have to 'escape' the percentage sign by putting a backslash (\\) in front of each % so it isn't (mis)interpreted by the shell.\nSo basically replace\n100%\n\nwith\n100\\%\n\nTherefore, the command you really REALLY need is:\n*/1 * * * * if [ `acpi -b | awk ' { print ($4)-0}'`  -lt \"15\" ] ; then pactl set-sink-volume 0 100\\% && pactl set-sink-mute 0 0 && mpg123 /home/andy/Alarm.mp3 ; fi\n\nphew hope that sorts it for you as it has for me!! (eventually!)\n\nA: One easy way to do this is to add a simple check to your crontab (cron is a system to run things on a regular, user-defined basis in the background.)\nFirst you need to install a command line mp3 player and acpi to be able to read battery state.\nFrom a terminal run the following to install the packages.\nsudo apt-get install acpi mpg123\n\nNext,while still in the terminal, type crontab -e and enter the following to the end of the file. Just change the user to your user name and the .mp3 to your filename in your home directory.  \n*5 * * * * if [ `acpi |awk '{print substr($NF, 0, length($NF)-1)}'`  -lt \"10\" ] ; then mpg123 /home/user/SuperCoolSound.mp3   ;fi\n\nHit Control-O (the letter) and Enter to save. Hit Control-x to exit\nExtra stuff you might want to read...\nUbuntu CronHowto\nUbuntu Guide\n\nA: You can set up a cron job which will check for battery status after every 5/10 min and then depending on the battery percentage it will play some sound.\nTo play the sound you can use\nmpg123 filename.mp3\nTo install it\nsudo apt-get install mpg123\nTo get battery status from command line you can use this command \nupower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0\nusing grep you can extract the exact info as follows\nupower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0| grep -E \"state|to\\ full|percentage\"\nNow you can put all these things in a shell script (and also an if condition to check if battery status is lower than 10%) and just give path of this shell script to cron job.\nso after every 5 mins (You can change this interval) your battery status will be checked and if battery is lower than 10% your provided sound file will be played!\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Actually I used the answer of Andy Pyne but it did not work for me. The cron executed the code, but it did not play the sound. Finally I have found the solution and sharing it here:\nStep 1: Install mpg3\nsudo apt-get install acpi mpg123\n\nStep 2:\nSave the following command in ~/bin/battery_alert\n#!/bin/bash\nPATH=/opt/someApp/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\nif [ `acpi -b | awk ' { print ($3)}'`  == \"Discharging,\" ] ; then\n    # Discharging\n    # Monitor for low battery\n    if [ `acpi -b | awk ' { print ($4)-0}'`  -le \"15\" ] ; then\n        pactl set-sink-volume 0 75\\% && pactl set-sink-mute 0 0 && mpg123 /home/user/battery_low.mp3 ;\n    fi\nelse\n    # Charging\n    if [ `acpi -b | awk ' { print ($4)-0}'`  -eq \"100\" ] ; then\n        # Fully charged\n        pactl set-sink-volume 0 75\\% && pactl set-sink-mute 0 0 && mpg123 /home/user/battery_full.mp3 ;\n    fi\nfi\n\nThis script plays battery_low.mp3 if the laptop is discharging and charge is less than or equal 15%. (If AC power is connected, it will not alert you). This code also alerts you, if the charge is 100%. If you do not want an alert for fully charged state, remove the else part from this code.\nStep 3: Make the file executable using the following command.\nchmod +x ~/bin/battery_alert\n\nStep 4: Execute this file using cron by adding the following command to the end of the file opend by crontrab -e command.\n*/5 * * * * /home/user/bin/battery_alert\n\n(Don't forget to have an empty line after this command)\n", "Q: Minecraft won't install I tried to install minecraft on my computer, but it won't display on-screen.

To fix it, you need to already have downloaded Minecraft before, and just copy the complete ~/.minecraft folder to replace the incomplete one.\nBasically, the Minecraft launcher is, for some reason, unable to create a new ~/.minecraft folder (meaning that you have to provide your own).\n\nA: The answer will depend on if you are using OpenJDK or Oracle's Java package. For OpenJDK, the best solution is to reinstall. If you use Oracle's Java package, try uninstalling it and using OpenJDK.\n", "Q: Why would permissions on a mounted volume be different when done manually vs. through fstab? I have a home server running Ubuntu, and several computers connecting to it running Ubuntu and Windows 7.  My main Ubuntu machine is having issues where any file or directory I move to the server will have read-only access, meaning I can not move the contents of the folder.  I've now found that if I mount manually via \"connect to server\", everything is fine, but if I connect with fstab, I have the permissions issue.\nWhat would cause the createmask or permissions settings to differ when mounted manually vs. through fstab?\nHere is an example from my fstab:\n//192.168.42.2/Fileserver   /media/theta    cifs    guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8   0   0\n\n\nA: A fairly insecure and permissive solution is to add ,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0666 immediately after guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8, leaving no space after the utf8 bit.\nI would encourage you to experiment with more restrictive settings like ,dir_mode=0755,file_mode=0644 and see if that will work for you.\nThe mount options are described in man mount. Except for cifs - the man page says:\nMount options for cifs\nSee the options section of the mount.cifs(8) man page (cifs-utils package must be installed).\n\nman 8  mount.cifs tells you everything you need to know and some more. It says (among other things):\nFILE AND DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS\nThe core CIFS protocol does not provide unix ownership information or mode for files and directories. \nBecause of this, files and directories will generally appear to be owned by whatever values the uid= or \ngid= options are set, and will have permissions set to the default file_mode and dir_mode for the mount.\n\n", "Q: Connect to UofU WPA2Enterprise I'm trying to connect to a WPA2Enterprise connection so I can stay connected at the University I study at.

Previous install was overwritten.\n\n*The black screen comes after logging in, not while booting.\n\n*The black screen comes regardless of the video driver, default(nouveau) or nvidia\n\n*It is not sporadic, it happens all the time.\n\n*It is not the result of returning from sleep or suspend.\n\n\nI did a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop 32bit (ubuntu-14.04-desktop-i386.iso) using liveUSB. The installation completes successfully, the system reboots, and I login.  After logging in: the screen (with the background visible) flickers and eventually goes black (no background, no Unity Panel, no Unity Launcher), and I am able to move the mouse about the screen.\nJust in case there is an update that resolves this, I switch to tty1 (Ctrl + Alt + F1) and type:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nReboot and same thing after logging in: the screen flickers and eventually goes black, and I am able to move the mouse about the screen.\nThe machine has nvidia graphics card, the GeForce FX 5700LE video card.\nlspci | grep VGA\n\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation NV36 [GeForce FX 5700LE] (rec a1)\n\nSo I install the nvidia 173 drivers:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-173\n\nReboot and now after logging in: the screen goes black, and I am able to move the mouse about the screen.\nThere are a number of post about Ubuntu 14.04 black screen after login, however they appear to be the result of upgrading from a previous version of Ubuntu and not a clean install.  Regardless of that I tired the solution to that problem which is to purge the existing nvidia drivers via sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia* . Not to my surprise after rebooting and logging in, I see the original behavior: the screen flickers and eventually goes black, and I am able to move the mouse about the screen.\nI also tried to boot Ubuntu in recovery mode using failsafeX, I see a popup that says, \"The System is running in low-graphics mode\".  No mouse is visible.  I hit tab and enter.  Next screen says, \"What would you like to do?\" and \"Run in low-graphics mode for just one session\" is selected.  I hit tab twice, highlighting \"OK\" and hit enter. Next screen says, \"Stand by one minute while the display restarts…\".  I hit enter. I see a shining black screen with no mouse.\nI read that this is might be another issue since it occurs *after* entering your password on the login page. \n\nA: Turns out unity does not support my video card.

If we had upgraded from a version < 4.3 of Virtual Box the directory ~/.VirtualBox will still be used instead. It is also the location where registered VMs are stored in an .XML file.\n\n\n*Virtual machines\nAll virtual machines and their settings are stored in an own directory, per default in ~/Virtual Box VMs/<Name of VM>/. Old machines from previous releases of Virtual Box will still reside in the ~/.VirtualBox/Machines for compatibility reasosn.\nTo delete virtual machines we will therefore have to unregister any machine and then also delete the machine's hard disk(s) and settings.

The problem is that this leaves the partitions in a somewhat \"fuzzy\" state. To avoid causing damage to your system, Ubuntu wisely refuses to mount those partitions. The solution is to force windows to fully shut-down. This can be achieved permanently by turning off fast boot or just once by pressing shift and clicking \"Shutdown\".\n", "Q: irssi: no terminal notification sound while pinged Initial Problem:\nInstalled a fresh copy of irssi for my terminal.

I know this is a Ubuntu-based Q&A board (didn't know where else to put it) so what I'm looking for is information on what Ubuntu does to the boot process when it is installed.\n\nA: You can choose whatever order you like. \ngrub will install at the same time as Ubuntu, but even if you rewrite another bootloader on top of it, you can always reinstall grub from a live-usb. \nSo, if you decide NOT to install Ubuntu the last, the easiest way to reinstall your grub, is : \n\n\n*\n\n*boot a live distribution (usb, dvd, ...)\n\n*get an internet connexion \n\n*type in a console : \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\n\nBoot-repair is a pretty useful GUI tool to \"repair\" the bootloader (in this case, install grub). \n\n\nA: I recommend you to install Ubuntu after installing other OS beacause it will detect correctly OS that has been already installed on your computer.\nHowever, just like Mr-Vaykadji said, you can reinstall grub with a live device if you have one.\n", "Q: NAS running Ubuntu / Raid 5 / SSD cache I'm about to setup a NAS - planned hardware so far:\n\n*\n\n*MB: ASUS P9D WS(*link1): sry, it's german, it says th MB supports Hot-Plug in AHCI or RAID Mode, supports Intel Smart Response (SSD Caching)\n\n*CPU: Intel Core i5-4570TE Processor\n(first I thought about Intel Xeon Processor E3-1220L v2, but I could not find any 1155 sockel MB with 6x SATA III interfaces / just 3x SATA III)\n\n*HDD: 3x WD30EFRX(*link2) (Western Digital Red 3TB) - I'm pretty sure this disk supports hot swapping as it was designed for NASusage\n\n*RAM: not sure yet, something like Crucial DIMM 4GB, DDR3L-1600, CL9, ECC\n\nThe (HD) hot swapping function with an Ubuntu raid5 system is possible, if the hw allows it. link\nJust one open question left (not at all ubuntu related - maybe somebody knows it though):\n\n*\n\n*How much SSD space is necessary to make the cache useful?\n\nThanks for your inputs ;-)\n*link1: future-x.de/asus-p8z77-ws-mainboard-atx-lga1155-socket-z77-usb-30-2-x-gigabit-lan-onboard-grafik-hd-audio-8-kanal-p-71172/\n*link2: wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/2879-771442.pdf\n\nA: I think you want to install Ubuntu on a server since you talk about RAID 5.

You can leave the cache and swap settings by default during installation.\n\n*You can not use hot-swapping with RAID 5 (it is something you can do if you raid your HDDs with RAID 1, instead.  But as I said, it has nothing to do with Ubuntu.\n\n\nAdvice: choose Ubuntu Server edition (not Desktop)\n\nA: The answer to this is always \"how much can you afford\"? Don't buy the cheap stuff. There's SLC and there's MLC. An 80 GB SLC is within an agreeable price point for most. Just wing it, don't fret over the metrics. Sounds like you're not serving up a filer for some global enterprise vpn with a hundred thousand requests per second here...\nI hope you're not doing anything important with that build.

However, if you still want to use your Radeon cards, you can try to install proprietary driver (Dash -> Additional Drivers) but honestly, there is no real reason to do so. There are almost no 3D video games for Linux, and proprietary drivers are often troublemakers especially in dual-GPU setup.

For example instead of typing cd this_is_a_long_file_name, I will type cd th<Tab>. But then I realize I have filled in the wrong command/filename and I have to hold down backspace to clear everything and repeat the process.\n\nA: Use Ctrl-c to cancel the current command, this also works if you haven't yet pressed enter. It will not clear the terminal though, only bring up your prompt on a new line. To clear the visual part of the terminal, you may press Ctrl-l\n\nA: A shortcut, Ctrl+u should do what you want.\n\nA: If you realized you pressed the wrong key, press Ctrl+_ (underscore, you may need to hold Shift depending on your keyboard layout, e.g. Ctrl+Shift+- a US keyboard) to undo the last editing command.\nIf you realized that you typed the wrong command name but the argument is right, you can use cursor movement commands such as arrow keys, Home and End to navigate to the part of the command line that you want to modify.\nThe commands Alt+b and Alt+f move back and forth by one word at a time. Alt+d and Ctrl+w delete the next word after the cursor, or the end of the word if the cursor is within a word; Alt+b uses the shell's notion of a word while Ctrl+w uses whitespace-separated words. Esc Backspace deletes the word before the cursor.\nIf you want to abandon the current command line completely and start afresh, press Ctrl+c.\n\nA: Ctrl+U will only clean from the cursor to the beginning of the line, so if the cursor is at the end of the line, all the line will be cleaned, and if not, there will remain the characters after the cursor.\nFor a complete answer, I will say:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+U - clear all the current line from the end to the beginning only if the cursor is at the end of the line.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can then recall the cleared line with Ctrl+Y if you need.\n\n\n*Ctrl+K - clear all the current line from the beginning to the end only if the cursor is at the beginning of the line.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can then recall the cleared line with Ctrl+Y if you need.\n\n\n*Ctrl+W - clear the previous word in the current line. For example if you have typed a command like git diff /path/to/some/file and you want to delete just the last parameter to the command, Ctrl+W is very useful.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can then recall the cleared data using Ctrl+Y if you need.\n\n\n*Ctrl+E Ctrl+U - move the cursor to the end of the line and clear all the current line from the end to the beginning.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can then recall the cleared line with Ctrl+Y if you need.\n\n\n*Ctrl+A Ctrl+K - move the cursor at the beginning of the line and clear all the current line from the beginning to the end.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can then recall the cleared line with Ctrl+Y if you need.\n\n\n*Ctrl+C - my favourite - cancel the current command line, which implies clear all the current line no matter where the cursor is.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disadvantage: you can't recall the cleared line anymore.\n\n\n*Alt+Shift+# - comment the current line, keep it in the history and bring up your prompt on a new line.\n", "Q: Java not working in Google Chrome Lubuntu 14.04 (32-bit) I have Java 1.7.0_55 installed I have gotten it to work on firefox.

I tried but it doesn't work on Ubuntu:\nsys.path.append(os.path.abspath('../../'))\nfrom Common import foo1.py\n\n\nA: The correct way to use relative import is:\nfrom ..Common import foo1\n\nAnd you also need a __init__.py in all your folders.\n\nA: NB: This answer is outdated for the latest version of python 3, but is here for earlier version. For more information read the comments and https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/ \n\nEssentially every folder with python code you want to add to the syspath needs an __init__.py file. These __init__.py files can be empty. \n\nA: How python finds its modules\nStrictly taken, a module is a single python file, while a package is a folder containing python files, accompanied by a (can be empty) file named __init__.py, to tell python it is a package to import modules from. In both cases, modules need their .py extension, but importing them is done without (see further below).\nBy default, Python looks for its modules and packages in $PYTHONPATH. \nTo find out what is included in $PYTHONPATH, run the following code in python (3):\nimport sys\nprint(sys.path)\n\nHow to add a directory\nOccasionally\nFrom within a python file, you can add path(s) occasionally to the default path by adding the following lines in the head section of your python application or script:\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(0, \"/path/to/your/package_or_module\")\n\nFor example:\nif I have a folder: /home/myname/pythonfiles, and I want to import the file module_1.py, located in that directory, I add this to the head section of my code:\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(0, \"/home/myname/pythonfiles\")\n\nAnd I can simply import the file module_1.py by:\nimport module_1\n\nWhen I create a package and want to import module(s) from the package, I need to create a folder in $PYTHONPATH, containing the modules, accompanied by a (can be empty) file called __init__.py\nFor example:\nTo import from a package (folder) called my_package in /home/myname/pythonfiles , add the /home/myname/pythonfiles path to your $PYTHONPATH, like in example 1, and import the module called module_2.py (inside the package folder) simply with: `\nfrom <packagename> import module_2\n\nAdding directories to $PYTHONPATH permanently:\nAdd the following line to your ~/.profile file.\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/you/want/to/add\n\nSubdirectories\nFrom within a package, subdirectories are not included just like that; you need to \"chain\" the directories. To import a module module_3.py, inside folder subfolder inside folder packagename:\nimport packagename.subfolder.module_3\n\nGiven the fact that all subfolders in the package include their own __init__.py file.\nWhen a module is in the same directory as the script or application\nThere is no need to insert the path to a module when it is in the same directory as the script or application, it is automatically added. \nExample:\nIf I have a folder, containing script.py and module.py, I can simply import the module by:\nimport module\n\n", "Q: i can't give more sound in ubuntu 12.04 i am facing sound problem in ubuntu 12.04.

So from what I gather windows can not look past the first partition if it is not in a \"windows friendly\" format.\n", "Q: xml2 installed but not found during compilation I'm trying to compile the lib https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs.\nI'm getting an error when running make: \nerror: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1\n(a long list of linker args follows)\nnote: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lxml2\n\nIf I'm reading this right, the linker cannot find the lib xml2. I made sure xml2 and libxml2 are installed (via sudo apt-get install) but that's not enough.\nWhat to do?\n\nA: In the Ubuntu packaging system, the libXXX packages often only contain the runtime libraries necessary for running applications that dynamically link the library. \nIn order to get the libraries and header files necessary for compiling and building, there is usually a separate libXXX-dev package (-dev indicating that the packages are for development). You can check what development packages are available for a particular library using the apt-cache search engine e.g.\napt-cache search devel | grep libxml2\n\nIn your case, you are probably missing the libxml2-dev package.\n", "Q: where is the system logs and recent entries I want to get system login logs in ubuntu 12.04 lts for last month as well as history like windows system.Please guide & help.\nJyoti\n\nA: All system log's is in /var/log\nYou have explanation for each log here \n\nA: You can list login information from the current month using this command as root\nlast -a\n\nAnd for the previous month, you need to check the previous file\nlast -a -f /var/log/wtmp.1\n\nFor unsuccessful logins run\nlastb -a\n\nCheck man last for more information.\n", "Q: 14.04 doesnt have package imagemagick Usually I had installed Image Magick on my Ubuntu systems with a command like this\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\nor like this:\nsudo apt-get install php5-imagick\n\nRight now I am running the latest 14.04, and those packages seem to have disappeared from the repositories.

Just recently I updated to 13.10, but there were some packages that didn't get installed properly, I thought this wouldn't be such a problem. When I tried to boot My freshly updated Ubuntu this morning, suddenly about 5 minutes in, my launcher and menu bar disappeared out of nowhere, leaving me unable to do anything, since I couldn't even open a terminal using the shortcut. I did a hard reset, rebooted and had the exact same problem. So I did a hard reset, rebooted in recovery mode and tried to fix the broken packages using the 'dkpg' option. This didn't do very much ad I waited an hour and nothing happened. I could type but not cancel the command or give any other command. I saw no other option than to do het another hard reset. When trying to reboot, my laptop now gives no reaction at all. As in nothing. The ligt doesn't even go on, the screen remains black, nothing happens.\nI thought this might be because I did too many hard resets, but I have no idea whether this could be possible.\nSince I am a Computer Science student with upcoming Finals this is a very urgent matter for me, and I have no idea what I could do next. \nThank you for your time and I hope you can help me out.\n\nA: i suggest you do a re-installation of ubuntu, install the latest ubuntu that is ubuntu 14.04 LTS on the ubuntu partition.

Didn't buy a separate gpu, since I didn't think I'd need any. I am using Ubuntu 14.04 (upgraded from 12.04 last month). Most of the time cpu usage is about 15-30% on all four cores, memory usages is about 15-20% and I'm using an SSD internal disk. With these numbers I wouldn't expect to have much lag from anything, when just browsing the web, yet at random times the pc seems to stutter or freeze for a sec. For example something opening the file browser goes fast, other times it goes fast, I have had gif files playing fine, but then randomly slow down. The most noticable thing that I think shouldn't be happening is when I am typing a large text like I'm doing now and the letters showing slows down. Typing shouldn't result in much delay shouldn't it? It's like the computer is having hiccups at random occasions, but I can't track down why.\nI didn't have this problem before and I just started noticing it recently. Did it start when I upgraded to 14.04? Another example would be when I used compizconfig manager again after updating, every time I changed a setting it would freeze the screen for a few minutes before working again. This problem has gone away now. I also tried using other lightweight desktops, thinking that maybe that would make a difference, but the problem was still there. So basically I have tried random, probably unrelated stuff, wasting my time not knowing where to start looking.\nI'm thinking of just downloading and reinstalling 14.04 from scratch since I'm working with an upgraded version of 12.04 now, hoping this will fix things, but before I do something that drastic, does anybody know how I could possibly track the problem down? I don't believe a quadcore computer with enough ram would possible stutter when typing a text like this... The thing is that the problem just suddenly appeared, while the computer had been working perfectly for a month or two. Did I maybe install something I shouldn't have? Or might some hardware be malfunctioning maybe? I don't know. Hope anybody can point me in the direction or can help me out. That would be much appreciated.\nEdit:\nuser@PC:/var/log$ cat syslog | grep -i warning\nMay 23 13:45:50 PC gnome-session[16809]: WARNING: Application 'compiz.desktop' killed by signal 11\nMay 23 13:45:50 PC gnome-session[16809]: WARNING: App 'compiz.desktop' respawning too quickly\n\nuser@PC:/var/log$ cat syslog | grep -i error\nMay 23 13:45:50 PC kernel: [13458.470094] compiz[17051]: segfault at 0 ip 00007f0e7659a000 sp 00007fffea049940 error 6 in libunityshell.so[7f0e76260000+53c000]\n\nuser@PC:/var/log$ cat kern.log | grep -i \"May 23\" | grep -i warning\nMay 23 10:01:34 PC kernel: [    0.000000] ACPI BIOS Warning (bug): Optional FADT field Pm2ControlBlock has zero address or length: 0x0000000000000000/0x1 (20131115/tbfadt-603)\nMay 23 10:01:48 PC kernel: [   17.506884] deprecated_sysctl_warning: 168 callbacks suppressed\nMay 23 10:01:48 PC kernel: [   17.506889] warning: process `vmware-hostd' used the deprecated sysctl system call with 1.1.\n\nuser@PC:/var/log$ cat kern.log | grep -i \"May 23\" | grep -i error\nMay 23 10:01:34 PC kernel: [    2.356186] nct6775: probe of nct6775.656 failed with error -16\nMay 23 10:01:34 PC kernel: [    2.933570] EXT4-fs (sda1): re-mounted.

It appears to me, that the issue got worse in Ubuntu 14.04 and firefox 33. A significant part of the issue seems to be caused by firefox (33) and in particular by the flash plugin which I deactivated eventually. But that doesn't fix the problem entirely. \nThe \"stutter\" comes in short and steady intervals, every few seconds, especially if firefox is running for a few hours already. It affects all applications. LibreOffice users may notice the exact same behaviour when typing, as described above by Peter Raeves. \nThe first I would do is to\n\n\n*\n\n*configure LibreOffice and increase the cache memory and \n\n*deactivate the flash plugin in firefox and restart firefox.\n\n\nFirefox can be further optimized by opening a new tab and enter about:config. \nThen set network.http.pipelining to true, set network.http.prox.pipelining to true, set network.dns.disableIPV6 to false. That will provide some improvement (but still not fix it entirely).\nI wonder if anyone else has experienced a similar issue and if the root cause, respectively resolution was found. It would be great if Mozilla finally was able to fix this issue that is plaguing Ubuntu users for years now.\n", "Q: Gimp options on Unity panel greyed out unless sudo I'm using Gimp2.8-2.9 on 13.10 and all of the drop-down options to modify a photo from the unity panel menu are greyed out unless gimp is run as sudo.

The \\K causes grep to discard everything matched before it so the result is that file://\\K[^<]+ will match the longest string of non-< characters that come after file://.\nThis is then fed to a while loop with IFS= to turn off word splitting at whitespace and -r to treat backslashes as normal characters.\nThe line SONG=\"${file//%20/ }\" converts all %20 to  (empty space). Otherwise, it returns a 'path not found' error when it tries to copy the songs in the last line.\nIf your file names can contain <, use this instead:\nperl -lne '@foo=(m#file://(.+?)</location>#g); END{print $_ for @foo}' playlist.xspf |\nwhile IFS= read -r file; do\n    cp \"$file\" /path/to/target/;\ndone\n\nNote: Both solutions assume that none of your file names contain newlines.\n", "Q: Setting up VMs on different subnets I run a server on IP X.Y.3.7 and i want to run multiple VMs on it using libvirt.\nI set up a bridge device:\nauto  eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\n\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\naddress   X.Y.3.7\nbroadcast X.Y.3.31\nnetmask   255.255.255.224\ngateway   X.Y.3.1\nbridge_ports none\nbridge_ports eth0\n...\n\nEverything works smoothly if use the first of my three additional IPs:\nX.Y.3.9\nHowever, the other 2 are from a different subnet\nX.Y.4.101\nX.Y.4.102\nThe bridged network approach does not seem to work with Guest from different subnets? What alternatives do i have? \n\nA: You br0 bridge only routes traffic in your X.Y.3.0/27 subnet.\nYou ought to create another bridge interface for your second subnet, or expand the size of your br0 netmask.\nFor example, you could make another bridge, br1. You'd need to use 255.255.255.248 as your netmask in order to use X.Y.4.101 as a host IP; if you instead use 255.255.255.252, X.Y.4.101 would be your default gateway.\nauto br1\niface br1 inet static\naddress   X.Y.4.100\nnetmask   255.255.255.248\ngateway   X.Y.4.97\nbroadcast X.Y.4.103\nbridge_ports eth0\n\nIf you want to join those two subnets into one which all use the same bridge interface (that is, you are not using any IP addresses from that new, larger subnet anywhere else) you can simply recalculate an appropriate netmask and broadcast address:\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\naddress   X.Y.3.7\nbroadcast X.Y.7.255\nnetmask   255.255.248.0\ngateway   X.Y.3.1\nbridge_ports none\nbridge_ports eth0\n\nThe disadvantage of using this second approach is that you wind up creating one very large subnet of 2048 address, from X.Y.0.0 - X.Y.7.255\nIf you were willing to do some tinkering with your routing table (and I cannot recommend this suggestion, as it would break CIDR-style notation and routing) you could create a more-complicated netmask for such a subnet, excluding more IP addresses That's generally a bad idea for a whole bunch of reasons.\n", "Q: Reinstalled Windows 7 starter, Ubuntu not installing? So, I have this Asus Eee PC 1201HA, and I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS via Wubi, but when I tried to factory reset my computer, an error came up the BOOTMGR was missing, or something.\nIn the end I just formatted my hard drive and reinstalled Windows 7 starter, but now that I tried to install Ubuntu back via a bootable USB with Unetbootin, I would restart my computer and choose to boot from the USB, but I would get the BOOTMGR is missing message again.\nI then tried to reinstall with wubi, but whenever I rebooted and chose Ubuntu to try to finish the install, it would take me to some magicbox or somethingbox commandline and say something along the lines of losetup: no loop found\nany suggestions?\n\nA: Honestly, Wubi sucks in my opinion. I would just download the .iso of Ubuntu 12.04LTS, burn it to a disk, pop it in the disk tray, reboot your machine and install Ubuntu. It comes with a partition manager once installing so you can determine how much you want to allocate for Ubuntu vs. Windows. You won't have to worry about overwriting your disk UNLESS you choose \"Erase Entire Disk.\" Wubi used to be good; however, I feel like there is a lack of communication between Ubuntu and the inventors of the side-by-side OS installer application. Hope this helps. In order to get rid of the GRUB/BOOTMGR issue, just uninstall Wubi and restart for confirmation.\n\nA: My comment would be too long.\nIf BOOTMGR was missing, that means that you probably installed/partitioned on top of where your boot records reside (usually on primary partition for Windows). You can do Bootrec.exe from Windows Recovery Command line (to get Windows working). \nIf you are unfamiliar with how partitions work, you can either read about 'Gparted', or you can create a partition in Windows for Ubuntu prior to installing using this link, or How do I install Ubuntu?\nNote: You will also want to make a swap partition (this is used to 'swap' data from memory (RAM) to disk). Windows does this in a form of a swap file/page file. which for both operating systems is usually at least double diskspace to RAM size. I.E. 1MB RAM = 2MB Hard disk space.  \nYou may also want to read about Dual Booting, which will also help explain somewhat how to do this. \nYou want to make sure that GRUB (the default bootloader for Ubuntu 12.04) is able to control your booting, as well as preserving the Windows bootloader as well. This is done by GRUB handling initial loading, then (after giving you an option to select Windows), will pass off to the Windows loader. Windows does not like other non-Windows operating systems so will at times overwrite other bootloaders, this is why you should install Windows first if you wish to have 2 systems. It is possible to do it in reverse, but often is more work. Windows 8 is worse in this manner, but enough of rant.  \n", "Q: How to update my BIOS I've been having some boot problems with it so I have Ubuntu and booted from the Drive.

If that is the case, YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT WITH A NATIVE PROGRAM.\n\n*\n\n*It will definitely not work on a virtual machine (it will try to update the virtual machine's BIOS, not your real machine's one).\n\n\n*Under WINE will probably fail to run, but it could even run and that could be MUCH more dangerous --- it could fail midway updating your BIOS and then you have a very expensive brick instead of a PC.\nYou can run the BIOS updater only with the operating system you downloaded it for. If it's Windows, so Windows. Sometime the manufacturer offer a MS-DOS version of the updater, that you can run in a bootable Free-DOS (search google) USB.

So, to have minimal loss of quality, is better to put the original jpg, (works with .png too) into the PDF, you need to use img2pdf.\nI use these commands:\nWith time I discovered a simpler, shorter one liner solution also using img2pdf that doesn't need pdftk as in the original answer \n\n*\n\n*Make PDF\nimg2pdf *.jp* --output combined.pdf\n\n\n*(optional) OCR the output PDF\nocrmypdf combined.pdf combined_ocr.pdf\n\nBelow is the original answer commands with more command and more tools needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*This to make a pdf file out of every jpg image without loss of either resolution or quality:\nls -1 ./*jpg | xargs -L1 -I {} img2pdf {} -o {}.pdf\n\n\n*Here you will have the *.pdfs as *.jpg.pdf, so will do a little renaming\nmmv \"*.jpg.pdf\" \"#1.pdf\"\nYou need to have installed img2pdf and mmv\nsudo apt install img2pdf mmv\n\n\nA: My first instinct for batch processing files is almost always find. It's excellent if you need to build in any sort of filtering (which you don't here) but it's still a favourite. This will also recurse into subdirectories unless you tell it (with -maxdepth 1 or other):\nfind -name '*.jpg' -exec convert \"{}\" \"{}.pdf\" \\;\nrename 's/\\.jpg\\.pdf$/.pdf/' *.jpg.pdf\n\nThe find/convert statement will output a load of .jpg.pdf files. The second cleans this up.\n\nPerhaps a slightly more elegant approach in such a simple case:\nfor file in *.jpg ; do convert \"$file\" \"${file/%jpg/pdf}\"; done\n\nThis doesn't recurse and you don't have to mess around cleaning up the filenames.\n\nAnd I almost forgot, ImageMagick has a numerical output which might fit your use-case perfectly. The following will just stick a three-digit identifier  (000, 001, 002, etc) on the end of the \"myPDF\":\nconvert *.jpg myPDF%03d.pdf\n\nObviously if you're dealing with more than a thousand entries, increase the number.

I question the worth of it but anyway...\n\nA: JRiver provides a Linux version (a .deb file).  Last time I used it, I could download my music without problems, but the program crashes on exit.

It is a great software manager. Ubuntu used to use this manager; however, like other Ubuntu software, it was discontinued in later OS distros.

I would appreciate your assistance in fixing this.

Actually the issue was only with APs not supporting N draft (so the old b/g standard). I checked three different boxes and all had the same issue. I had however no issues with the one AP that had N-draft support.\nThe problem was that the default bitrate with old APs was always set to 1Mb/s even though the link quality was 70/70. But I was not even able to ping default gw. So the solution was to issue:\n/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 rate auto\n\nUnfortunately I do not see an option in ubuntu NetworkManager to specify bitrate (I do not use configuration from /etc/network/interfaces) so I added the iwconfig command to\n/etc/init.d/wifirifi\n\nand issued\nchmod ugo+rx\nupdate-rc.d wifirifi defaults\n\n", "Q: Wireless network continously disconnects I have pavilion g6 with ubuntu 12.04 installed , My wireless networks keeps on disconnecting and then takes a long time to connect\nCan someone suggest a possible solution for this problem ?\nHere are the output of some commands that might be useful to solve the problem\nlspci\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor DRAM Controller (rev 09)\n\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v2/3rd Gen Core processor PCI Express Root Port (rev 09)\n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB xHCI Host Controller (rev 04)\n\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 (rev 04)\n\n00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #2 (rev 04)\n\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04)\n\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev c4)\n\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 2 (rev c4)\n\n00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 3 (rev c4)\n\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1 (rev 04)\n\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation HM76 Express Chipset LPC Controller (rev 04)\n\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series Chipset Family 6-port SATA \nController [AHCI mode] (rev 04)\n\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller (rev 04)\n\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

How can one rename them as photo1, photo2,...,photo1000 from the command-line/terminal? \n\nA: You can use this code :\nfor i in *.jpg; do let j+=1 ; mv \"$i\" \"photo$j.jpg\" ; done\n\n\nA: I will assume that you want to keep a proper suffix on the filenames:\nc=1; for f in *.jpg ; do mv \"$f\" \"photo$c.jpg\" ; c=$(($c+1)) ; done\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*c=1:  This initalizes the counter.  You can set it to any number you like.\n\n*for f in *.jpg ; do:  This signifies the beginning of a shell for-loop.  While much of shell-scripting can be difficult to make work when file names can contain spaces, newlines or other difficult characters, this construction is safe against even the most hostile file names. \n\n*mv \"$f\" \"photo$c.jpg\":  This uses the counter c and does the actual renaming of files.  The file name $f is in double-quotes to protect the name from the various possible shell expansions.  \n\n*c=$(($c+1)): This increments the counter for the next loop\n\n*done:  The signifies the end of the for loop.\n", "Q: Working with byobu splits Is there a way to start automatically a window with multiple splits running their own application using byobu? am using tmux as the backend.\n Also, how do i select the content of a split for pasting later?  When i tried this with the mouse.it also included the content of the adjacent split.\n\nA: You can indeed start byobu or tmux with multiple windows or splits, either running the default shell or any program you want. See the tmux man page for a full list and descriptions of all commands accepted by tmux.\nIn general, any tmux command can be passed as arguments to byobu. Multiple commands can be chained together using \\;. Here are some example usages that may help you do what you want.\nStart byobu with 3 shell windows\nbyobu new-session \\; new-window -d \\; new-window -d\n\nStart byobu with a shell and vim in a side-by-side split\nbyobu new-session \\; split-window -d -h vim\n\nStart byobu with 2 vims in stacked split and a second window\nbyobu new-session vim \\; split-window -d vim \\; new-window -d\n\n\nAs to your question about copying text from a split (I assume you mean a side-by-side split), the best option is probably to use Shift+F11 to temporarily zoom the split to take up the whole window. After copying the text, the split can be restored with Shift+F11 again.\n", "Q: How do I install utorrent on ubuntu 14.04 other instructions seem specific to older versions of the os I have tried following some of the step by step instructions given but I think some of eh codes and instructions that need to be entered into the terminal window may be specifically for older versions of the Ubuntu operating system\n\nA: There isn't (yet) a 14.04 package from the µTorrent team.\nInstead you have to work with the 13.04 package, which you can download from HERE.\nmake sure you have libssl installed:\nsudo apt-get -y install libssl0.9.8\n\nextract your downloaded tarball to /usr/local:\ncd /usr/local && sudo tar -xzf /path/to/utserver.tar.gz\n\nsymlink that into place:\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/utorrent-server-alpha-v3_3/ /usr/local/utorrent/\n\nextract the webUI and set up the necessary subdirectories:\ncd /usr/local/utorrent\nsudo unzip webgui.zip\nsudo mkdir maint torrents.queue torrents.active\n\ncopy and paste this example configuration file into /usr/local/utorrent/utserver.conf using your editor of choice (e.g. vim, nano, gedit):\ndir_root: /usr/local/utorrent/\nut_webui_dir: /usr/local/utorrent/webui/\ndir_active: /usr/local/utorrent/torrents.active/\ndir_completed: /home/<userid>/Downloads/\ndir_temp_files: /usr/local/utorrent/tmp\ndir_autoload: /usr/local/utorrent/torrents.queue/\ndir_request: /usr/local/utorrent/maint\n\nYou can now start µTorrent like this:\nsudo utorrent -settingspath /usr/local/utorrent/\n\nAnd connect to the webUI at localhost:8080/gui with admin and no password (change that immediately).\nEDIT: 201405241343Z: replaced opt with usr/local as more idiomatic for debian/ubuntu\n\nA: The current webui.zip extract to folders ./web/ and ./mobile/\nut_webui_dir: /usr/local/utorrent/webui/\nwill not work.\nYou have to \nunzip webui.zip && mv web webui\nand update your config to \nut_webui_dir: /usr/local/utorrent/\nto point to the parent directory.

When I try to start it, I just get the error message:\n\nSuitable java binary not found.\n\nThe output of java -version is: \n\njava version \"1.7.0_55\"\n  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_55-b13)\n  Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 24.55-b03, mixed mode)\n\nAnybody have any ideas?\nThanks\nPeter\n\nA: The fault is with the omegat shell script which tries to find out java version. The script is supposed to start the program only if it finds an openjdk or a sun java implementation on the machine. For this, it tries to look at the path where java is installed using below line:\nJAVA=$(which java | xargs readlink -f) \nThen checks whether the \"path\" contains the name openjdk or sun in it by\necho \"$JAVA\" | grep -q -e '\\(openjdk\\|sun\\)'\nNow, here's the problem. You may not always install java at a location having the name \"sun\" in it, as in my case it was at /usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_07/bin/java. \nSo, the solution lies in simply correcting this script as you already HAVE the suitable java version installed.\nHere's my working /usr/bin/omegat file.\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\nJAVA_OPTIONS='-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni'\n\nJAVA=$(which java | xargs readlink -f)\n\necho \"$JAVA\" | grep -q -e '\\(openjdk\\|sun\\)'\n#CHANGE 1, just use your java here.\nJAVABIN=$JAVA\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]\nthen\n    JAVABIN=$JAVA\nelif [ -x /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/bin/java ]\nthen\n    JAVABIN=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/bin/java\"\nelif [ -x /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/bin/java ]\nthen\n    JAVABIN=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/bin/java\"\nelif [ -x /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/bin/java ]\nthen\n    JAVABIN=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/bin/java\"\nelse\n    echo \"Suitable java binary not found.\"\n#CHANGE 1, comment out the exit line below.\n   # exit 1\nfi\n\nexec $JAVABIN $JAVA_OPTIONS -jar /usr/share/omegat/OmegaT.jar $*\n\n\nNotice the 2 \"#CHANGE\" lines in the script. Oh yes, you need to edit the file as root.\n\nA: I have the same problem. I found this: http://markmail.org/message/hvfl2hhhaqjk243q\nbut don't know what to do with it.\nFrom the link: The solution is easy: in /usr/bin/omegat, the bash script tests java version and checks if it's openjdk or sun. Replace 'sun' by 'oracle' and it works. The author of the question has Oracle Java, not openjdk-6-jdk or openjdk-7-jdk, installed so this solution should also work for him.\n", "Q: Cant get a wireless connection on Ubuntu 14.04 I'm using an Acer Aspire 5750z-4835 and cant get my wireless internet to work.

Except from the illegal programs, movies etc. it also had almost every freeware's program new versions uploaded there. It was a very easy way to keep track of the new versions of programs.\nIt also had a very nice forum, the best Greek forum ever, in my opinion.\nSo, if I recall correctly, somebody begun reporting to Rapidshare and other file sharing sites about the pirate links available to those hosts. The corresponding hosts begun removing those links in order to avoid any copyright claims, I suppose.\nThen GreekDDL hired a programmer to make a program based on JDownloader in order to download indirectly the links from the site. Basically you clicked on a button on the site and the links were added directly to your download section of the program.\nOf course, the links could still be obtained from programs like Wireshark, but the reporters weren't so into tech and the reports stopped.\nEventually greekddl.com closed and became a news site that wasn't updated at all. Now it seems to be offline.\nSo,  you won't be able to use that program but I doubt you would want to, because it was used directly for piracy.\nPS: I was the one created the article you provided with your link, so the screenshot must be from my PC when greekddl was still up. Blame me for piracy :( You cannot prove anything :D Jokes aside, I was curious to see if I could still get that links through sniffing.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use the same java application with out any changes as a charm?

Without knowing more about your application, you could expose the input data as a configuration parameter on the charm in config.yaml file within the charm. After the application is installed and the configuration parameter (input data) is set (juju set charmname input-data=\"cat input_file\") , the application could be triggered to compute the output.\n\n*Most of the time it is possible to charm up an application without changing the application.  The install hook would need to install a JRE (apt-get install default-jre) in this example and the config-changed hook could trigger/call the application when the input has been set (for example: java org.rastin.Application input_data_file)\n\n*I do not know the details of your application, so hard to answer this question.  Often no rewrite is needed, you just need to write the hook logic to install and configure the application in the charm.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Is it possible to execute a .desktop file from a quicklist?

How do you make a text file containing bash commands which will be run by the Ubuntu terminal from the top of the file to the bottom.\n\nA: Your \"shell\" or the command line interface is called bash. You can write a bash script which is similar to a batch file. A bash script starts with a She-bang #!/bin/bash and is nothing more then a set of commands to run in a sequence to run them. You are not limited to bash command, you can call any binary on the system by using the full path to the binary or script. \nA master thread on learning/books/terminal/bash/Linux etc\nLinux Command Line Learning Resources - cortman\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommandLineResources\nMy first bash was several commands I was running multiple times in terminal.

After rebooting the computer, nothing but a blank, black screen is displaying with a fixed mouse in the centre of the screen. Can this be fixed or do I need to re-install?\n\nA: From what you've described, it appears as if the power outage you experienced happened during an update to some of the system software. The outage essentially \"bricked\" your computer -- made its operating system completely unusable. You will need to reinstall the operating system.\nSmall suggestion - if at all possible, try to backup or copy any of your valuable files to an external location (e.g. a USB pen drive), you might not want to lose them when you reinstall.\n", "Q: What's wrong with this thumbnailer?

If you look into this, you can format the partition for Ubuntu 13.04 and mark it to install Ubuntu 14.04. This will leave your Windows 7 partition untouched.\n\nA: Simple! You can just update from your Ubuntu 13.04 up to 14.04! It takes a while, but what you do is go to your software updater, and once you have all your updates installed, chose to upgrade to 13.10, then to 14.04!

This generally does a more thorough job of removing applications.\n", "Q: How to use a theme. When I downloaded a theme, .tar.gz or .gz or some kind of format like that.  When I opened it, it was just a folder full of files.  How do I make it a theme or something?\n\nA: You will need to open your archive manager as root. Use Alt+F2 and type gksu [packagemanager] where [packagemanager] is the command for the archive manager. (In not too heavily changed Ubuntu installations, this is file-roller.) Open the file, then extract the entire package to the directory /usr/share/themes (or /usr/share/icons for cursor themes or icon themes).\nNext, you will need a program to apply the theme. I suggest the GNOME Tweak Tool. Install this by opening the terminal and typing these commands, one by one:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ricotz/testing\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nOnce this is done, you can either search for the tool in the HUD or run it directly by pressing Alt+F2 again and typing gnome-tweak-tool. In the dialog that appears, there should be some options on the left for \"Theme\". Click that, and change the theme settings to your liking. The effect should be immediate.\n\nA: The Community Wiki recommends that you extract the archives into either ~/usr/share/themes or icons to ~/usr/share/icons.\nThe recommended application to manage themes, unity-tweak-tool, is available from the Ubuntu Software Center.\nFrom terminal:\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nAlternatively, you can visit the project page http://ubuntu-tweak.com/ and download the debian file package. Ubuntu-tweak offers more configuration options than just customizing unity themes.\n\nI had previously copied the recommendation for  the Myunity tool from the Community Pages, but it is no longer receiving popular attention.  The only thing close to an explanation that I could find in the forums. Searching this site, it seems that MyUnity is 3rd party software and is the solution for Ubuntu 12.04, but that the unity-tweak-tool is preferred for newer releases (my inference).\nAdditional edits incorporate advice from this answer.\n\nA: Some theme authors include an install script in the archive; if you find a file called INSTALL or something similar, extract the archive to a folder that is preferably easy to get to. Then open the terminal and cd to the applicable folder (probably ~/Downloads by default). Then in terminal, run ./[Name-of-Install-Script] to install.\n", "Q: Increasing mouse speed Running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI have Ubuntu on my Laptop, as well as here, my Desktop.

(And it has its drawbacks, too, like the fact that the thumbnails are in my opinion managed much better in nautilus). \n\nTL,DR version: \nOnce upon a time, nautilus (the file manager used in Gnome and Unity) used to remember the view mode for each directory. Then the \"simplification frenzy\" started, and willing or not, a lot of nice features were deemed \"too complex\" and ditched. Emblems, tree view, double pane, and this thing you are asking for. Although maybe this one was just a bug, I am not sure --- see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=683802. \nLinux used to have the best graphical file managers around; now probably (apart from KDE dolphin and maybe nemo) I sometime wish to have the windows file manager available. \n\nA: I think I have a fix...\nOpen a window.\nDon't click on anything.\nWith the browser window as the active window, \"Mouse\" to the upper left-hand corner of the screen.\nClick Edit > Preferences.\nUnder the \"Views\" tab, change your default view to what you want. \n- Also, change the zoom level of \"List View\" to 50%.\n", "Q: Firefox does not load local html files kubuntu 14.04 I have used kubuntu(10.04 & 12.04) and firefox for many years.

I can access Unity fine (posting from Unity right now), but both Metacity and Compiz GNOME Flashback sessions log in, show my wallpaper, and my start-up apps load, but no gnome-panel.\nI've uninstalled and re-installed gnome-session-flashback (purged on uninstall), no luck.  Yes, I even tried turning it off and on again (sorry, had to throw that in there).\n/var/log/syslog says that gnome-panel.desktop was killed with signal 6, and ~/.xsession-errors shows that indicator-application main process ended (2x) and then says it stopped trying to respawn it.\nHas anyone seen this issue, and if so, is there a solution?  Thanks in advance!\n\nA: EDIT:  I broke it again (about 5-10 mins after posting my original answer below)... then I fixed it!  Turns out, when I was adding a new app to the Applications menu in flashback using alacarte it happened again, so I went to kill all my .desktop files, and as it turns out I somehow corrupted something in ~/.config/menus.\nSpecifically, I added an entry to the Internet category, and it created a duplicate Internet entry, and when trying to hide that, gnome-panel crashed.\nLet's see if I can do what I want without breaking things...\n\nAfter taking some more time to troubleshoot the issue, I've found that it's something specific to my user account.  I tried logging in as a guest with gnome-flashback (as I should have done originally) and it worked!\nI tried clearing all my Unity, Metacity, Gnome, and Compiz settings with no luck.  I tried reinstaling flashback, compiz, and making sure everything was up to date.  None of these helped.  I can only suspect that a file got corrupted somehow in a settings file I didn't know to reset.\nSeeing as I'm more familiar with Ubuntu Server than I am desktop, I decided to backup my home directory, delete my user account, and re-create it and restore my documents, music, etc. from the backup.\nSo far so good.

I have a java computer program that I can compile in Eclipse just fine. I want to compile it from the command line and get the message javac not found.

Am I missing something silly? Thanks.\n\nA: The default Java runtime environment (JRE) on Ubuntu is OpenJDK (instead of Oracle/Sun). Unlike the name OpenJDK this comes as two parts: a JRE (default-jre) and a JDK (default-jdk).\nTo also install the JDK (providing javac), install the metapackage default-jdk  and you should be all set.\nIn case you have more than one Java runtime or Java compiler installed, select the right one with update-alternatives:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java   # runtime\nsudo update-alternatives --config javaws # runtime Web Start (applets)\nsudo update-alternatives --config javac  # compiler\n\n\nA: It seems like the openjdk you are using isn`t a jdk(besides the name). It is just a jvm (it can run java programs but not compile them).\nMy solution was download the jdk from oracle site: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html\n(this link is for jdk7, if you need another version just look for jdk in the site).\n\nA: It looks like my default install came with some weird version of Java - not the OpenJDK but even another version. I did an aptitude install to get the openjdk-7 and then everything worked fine.\nI was confused because Eclipse compiled without a javac on the system, but I guess Eclipse has some tools inside that allow it to compile.\n", "Q: Google Chrome messed icons and fonts Strange things happen to my Google Chrome (35.0.1916.114) in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nAs you can see icons and fonts are different and also tab styles changed.

This doesn't answer the original question of why apt-get attempted to install libc++ which apparently doesn't exist and why it got into conflicts (whith CUDA of all things!).\n\nA: Firstly type 'sudo apt-get -f install'. This will try to fix broken dependencies. If this ends up 'and x not upgraded', then type the following afterwards: 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'. This last command might install some new packages, so be careful. \n\nA: There is no package called libc++. It is libc++1.\nSo run the command as :\nsudo apt-get install libc++1 multiarch-support libc6 libc++-dev libc++-helpers libc++-test libc++abi-dev libc++abi-test libc++abi1\n\n\nA: The package libc++ doesn't exist. Most likely, apt-get is treating \"libc++\" as a regex and installing anything that matches that regex. Hence, you get the long list of packages to install.\nThe package you're (probably) looking for is libc++1.\n", "Q: Cannot run a GUI app from cron After doing a \"sudo su -\" on an Ubuntu 12.04 notebook I did a \"crontab -e\", added this: \n* * * * * env DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/gnome-calculator\n\nand waited for minutes.

Please suggest a solution.\nhi these are some additional details..\ni went to bios and it shows that i have 2gb ram only...\ni put ubuntu 14.04 on a usb stick again and restarted my computer...during re-installation, the ubuntu 14.04 recognizes that you have windows and ubuntu 14.04 and provides an option to erase the existing ubuntu 14.04 and re-install ubuntu 14.04....i did that...the newly installed ubuntu 14.04 still has the same problem..\nbut during re -install there is this option something else..and it has settings for swap space etc..but i dunno how to do it...\np.s i took screenshots, but i dont know how to upload it here..there is no option here to\nupload images..could anybody please tell me how to do it...\n\nA: This actually looks like a stick of ram has vanished!\nWhen either Linux or Windows is running on bare hardware, they will see all of the hardware of the system, did you open your system in order to install a new HDD for the ubuntu install?\nWindows and Linux will both probably be seeing the same stick of ram, please update your post with infomation on anything which you may benefit us to help you, including the answers of the other question.\n\nA: You have try to check on the two sticks of  RAM.\nPower down PC completely. Unplug the PC. Remove the RAM and clean the contacts with contact cleaner. Do not touch the contacts. Reseat the RAM. Reboot and check if it helped.\nIf not, then remove one stick of RAM and try to boot. If it did not then remove that stick and insert the other stick and boot. This might tell you which RAM stick is bad or which RAM port on the motherboard is bad.

I recently started playing DOTA2 through Steam on my box and decided to upgrade a few of the components for better gameplay. First I added in another 4GB card to bring my total up to 8GB of RAM and I bought a new GPU as well (Radeon R7 260x). I found that my PSU was likely a little underpowered, so I picked up a new Capstone 550w and got that and the new graphics card installed.\nI've since noticed several \"problems\" or symptoms at the very least. Sometimes I get this weird snow on the screen (think turning on an old CRT TV without the coax cable plugged in) but it's very minimal. Overall you can see the picture just fine, but if you look closely at the screen you can see noise in the image (usually flickering red dots all over the screen). Rebooting seems to fix the \"red snow\" problem. I've also had some random reboots but lots and lots of freezes which only happen when I'm gaming (sometimes in the middle of games, other times just while the game is loading). I've done a BUNCH of searching around, but I can't find any clear indicators as to what my problem might be.\nSystem details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running the Oz Diamond II-b Unity UE (Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit)\n\n*AMD Radeon R7 260x GPU\n\n*AMD Phenom II X6 1045T 6-core CPU\n\n*2x4GB Kingston HyperX Red RAM\n\n*Asus M6A78L-M LX motherboard\n\n*120GB Intel SSD\n\n*500GB hard drive (can't recall the brand)\n\n*Capstone 550w PSU\n\n\nOther Info:\nI did try out the new GPU for about 5 minutes with the old power supply (it booted just fine, but suddenly Unity was broken) so I reinstalled the old GPU until I had the new PSU. After installing all the new components, Unity was still broken and nothing I could do seemed to help, so I ended up just reinstalling the OS over it which fixed my Unity problems. The ONLY time I think I've had any of the freezes or reboots has been when playing, or trying to play, DOTA2.\nAlso I've installed the \"latest drivers\" from AMD's website for the GPU, but when I go to the Additional Drivers section of System Settings it doesn't show ANY options (no open source or proprietary drivers). Is it something to worry about?\nAny/all advice is much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\nA: Do a Memory Test & make sure your RAM's are working fine.\nSo, I had similar issues with a heavy config like this. I thought Ubuntu is having compatibility issues with the hardware I have purchased so ignored & moved on to windows again. But recently I tried it again but the same issues were still there. The issues I had ranged from - chrome keeps crashing, eclipse keeps crashing, steam keeps crashing & all I found in logs were \"segmentation faults\".  I searched on every forum but did not find the exact cause or a fix.\nFinally I went to ubuntu's IRC channel #ubuntu & some guys helped me & suggested that I run a Memory Test on my RAMs. \nI downloaded MemTest+ http://www.memtest.org/download/5.01/memtest86+-5.01.usb.installer.zip from http://www.memtest.org/\nCreated the bootable USB & restarted my system. Booted with the USB & the tests started. All tests failed. So turned out that one of my RAM was corrupted & was causing all the crashes. I had two 4Gb corsair vengeance RAMS. Removed the corrupted one & now Ubuntu is running flawless. Not a single crash since I removed the RAM(past 3 days)\nRemember when you run memory tests, make sure you cover all combinations & slots. Try with both rams first, then individual rams & even try switching the slots in which the rams are put. Sometimes for a fail test to occur, it takes many hours, so if you have time leave each combination of test running for a while. But in my case as soon as the test started it started showing failure.\nJust give this a try.\n", "Q: How to view 3D PDF files?

So the OP has probably just changed the  permissions of the /  folder, not recursively,  and he or she can recover the system simply with a\nchmod 755 /\n\nfrom a recovery boot. For example, boot from the installation media, choose try Ubuntu, open a terminal and go superuser (do the following checking thrice and only after having understood what you are doing)\nsudo -i\nmount /dev/yourrootpartitonhere /mnt\ncd /mnt\nchmod 755 .\ncd ..\numount /mnt\n\nAnd reboot normally, all should be OK.\nIf you did use -R, do a backup of your data (see other answers here), and reinstall.\n\nA: Thanks for your answers.\nI freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04, however I was able to backup my data using live CD.  \nI booted from a live CD and I did chmod 777 / 'pathOfTheDirectory'\nDo not mess with things in which you don't have much knowledge - lesson learned.\n\nA: If you ran the command chmod -777 /foo, it could have some weird functionality.  Most likely, it will negate the bits you are passing in the octal negation of 777 (which is 111111111 in binary, which is important), which is not actually possible to represent, since chmod is using a 9 bit set for file permissions (1 bit per permission for read, write, execute * owner,group,user), which is an unsigned number (cannot be negative).\nLet's assume that you can represent signed numbers (negative and positive values). If you find 2's complement of 777 (0b111111111), then you can figure out the exact behavior of (and number you are passing to) the command:\n 111111111\n-000000000\n----------\n 111111111\n+000000001\n----------\n1000000000 #this number will cause an overflow because it is 512\n           #since our range is only -256 -> 255\n\nWhat does all this mean?  You told the kernel \"Hey, make the permissions for this folder 1000000000\".  The kernel responded with \"Ok\" and did what you asked.  Now your filesystem permissions are exactly that, --------- root root /.  This is all assuming that I (and your kernel/CPU) did the math correctly.\nRecovery\nThe root filesystem's (what / is) default permissions are usually 755.  The easiest way to fix this is to log in and switch to tty using Ctrl+F1 (which will take you to tty1, tty2-6 are open as well, with tty7 being the location of the current X session).  You can log in as root (or as a regular user, but use sudo before each command below) and run this command:\nchmod 755 /\n\nThat should fix the issue you are having.\n", "Q: GDM and Lightdm don't work after update; KDM is ok After updating Ubuntu (apt-get update, apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade) last Tuesday, GDM stopped working, and the startup hangs on the Ubuntu logo.

of gdm.log (whose contents CameronNemo asked me to post) and found out the solution in this link.\nThe problem was an invalid line in /etc/profile probably inserted during an update:  \n[[ -f \"/etc/autopackage/paths-bash\" ]] && . \"/etc/autopackage/paths-bash\"\n\nI just commented this line and now GDM is working properly.\n\nA: Try purging (not uninstalling) everything but one display manager, then give the boot log. Also, would you mind pasting the output of sudo cat /var/log/upstart/gdm.log ?\n\nA: I had the same problem on Ubuntu 14. I used Ctrl+Alt+f2, then logged in. When I inspected the file \"/etc/profile\", I found that I had inserted an illegal character while setting up the path. After correcting that, I logged off and restarted and my GDM was working perfectly. I would advise you to inspect the file for illegal characters.\n", "Q: Icecast2 and darkice stream playing too slow I am trying to access my InstantFM USB radio dongle using icecast2 and darkice. \nI have it set up well enough that when I access the stream (192.168.2.108:8000/instantfm) I do get sound but it is playing extremely slow.

Is it possible for xbindkeys to detect double clicks separately from single clicks? If so, how would I do this, and if not, is there an alternative option available?\n\nA: This question is from 2014, but probably someone still have this problem, so I wanted to share my solution. Before getting to my single line of code, please note, that xbindkeys supports a guile configuration (http://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/xbindkeysrc.scm.html) where you can add advanced functionality. I didn't check it out, but probably this will be the best solution for it.\nWhen you want to stick with your old configuration, I wrote a small hack to achieve a double action:\n\"if ls ~/.xbk_double_caps; then [YOUR COMMAND]; else touch ~/.xbk_double_caps; sleep .5; rm ~/.xbindkeys_doubleclick; fi\"\n\n    Caps_Lock\n\nThis script will activate [YOUR COMMAND] when Caps_Lock key is pressed two times in 0.5 seconds. It checkes if a temporary file exists. If not, it'll touch this file but delete it after 0.5 seconds. Between touching and deleting, [YOUR COMMAND] can be triggered.\nIt works great for me.\n", "Q: Win 8.1 Bootloader: Your PC Needs to be repaired/A device required for boot is not connected Hello Fellow Ubuntuans!\nI've got Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8.1 pro dual booting on my PC and everything has been fine until about a month ago. Recently every time I reboot into Windows after Ubuntu I get a boot failure saying your PC needs to be repaired and that a device required to boot isn't connected. I reboot and it's fine. I reboot another few times and as long as I don't pick Ubuntu in the bootloader screen it boots fine. Once I boot into Ubuntu, my first Windows boot after that fails. \nNow obviously the error is bogus (since a mere reboot fixes it without me reconnecting this magical invisible device that is so important to booting), but I'm wondering if maybe Ubuntu or Microsoft caused this with an update.\nThings were definitely fine with Ubuntu 13.10, but now I'm on 14.04. The problem is I don't often switch back & forth on this machine so I don't know if maybe 14.04 is the culprit (it defaults to Windows as it's my gaming machine.

Where should I start the debug?\nI think that some important packages were removed.\nI have terminal access, and I can copy files from another computer that is connected to the Internet (if this is needed).\nIs there any way to repair it via an installation CD/DVD?\n\nA: Your first step is getting Apt connected to the internet... You have more than one option here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you have the option of plugging an ethernet cable in? This should bring a connection up straight away and if it doesn't check that /etc/network/interfaces has something along the lines of:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\n\n*If that's a no-go, use nmcli assuming Network Manager is still installed (man nmcli should help lots). You'll need to list your available connections and then start your wifi up with something like: \n$ nmcli c\nNAME              UUID      TYPE                 \nHome              03e52aa   802-11-wireless    Sat 24 May 2014 21:43:00 BST\n$ sudo nmcli c up id Home\n\n\n*You could learn how to manually connect. I'll be honest, there's a reason Network Manager exists. Unless you're using a simple wired connection, this isn't simple.\n\n*If you nuked Network Manager too (or it doesn't work) I think I would fall back to chrooting your install from within a LiveCD (with a working network connection). It's not as hard as it sounds.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the LiveCD (Select Try Ubuntu).\n\n*Set up a network connection like you normally would.\n\n*Open a terminal and run sudo fdisk -l and note the /dev/sdX# name of your install's partition. In this example I assume /dev/sda1.\n\n*Mount it with sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt — If you have mounted it as something else (eg if you used Nautilus and it mounted as /media/ubuntu/...) you need to replace /mnt in the following two commands with its actual mount point.\n\n*Cross-mount various system things. You don't need to understand or change this line:\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\n\n\n*Chroot in: sudo chroot /mnt. You are now effectively root on your old install.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, once you're connected, this gets a lot more simple.

Currently running W2K.  Recent hard drive failure caused loss of many tweaks that made the OS almost usable.  \nSeriously considering Ubuntu for browsing and email.  Don't really want a dual boot setup so I'm leaning toward VM on Ubuntu.\nI have several Windows applications that I must use. One is EdgeCam, a CAD/CAM program that uses a physical parallel port dongle and openGL graphics.  \nI guess my question would be: will the dongle be recognized when running the program on a VM?\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The virtualised parallel port will possibly have different signal timings, which may cause incompatibility with a protection dongle. From the VirtualBox forums:\n\nThere can be no guarantees that a particular parallel device will\n  work. If it's very fussy about timing, say for example a JTAG flash\n  programmer, then I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't work. Obviously\n  the implementation details of software protection dongles are not\n  widely published, but no that would not surprise me either.\n\nThe answer is likely to be highly dependent on your dongle and your PC - in theory, exactly the same setup could work with one type of LPT controller but not another, due to the way they generate signal timings, and the way that this is interpreted by the dongle. You will just have to try it and see if it works for your case.\nAlso note that a W2K era PC will lack Intel/AMD hardware virtualization extensions, and hence a VM will be slower than you might expect.\n\nA: A workarround can be passing a PCIe to Parallel port card, some Google links tell some work, some not.\nBut most of the users do not know the parallel port inside the guest can be seen as LPT3, but dongles normally expect LPT1, so ensure you can change what LPT number in the device properties of the guest.\nSome people also say the dongle does not work on host, but passing the whole PCIe card to the guest, on the guest it works... weird thing is that guest runs the same version of Windows than the host; i think it can be related to host not leting you to assing what LPT number to use and it is using LPT3 or upper number but when on guest it uses LPT1.\nAll is a matter of testing, so ensure you buy someone with a coment of users that it works with dongles and LPT port number can be configured.\nI am also on a search for a PCIe to LPT1 since mainboard lacks LPT port, and also for useing it under VirtualBox guests (not only on the host).\nSo best solution i think: Buy a PCIe to DB25 (SPP | EPP | ECP) card adapter.\nHope you have at least one free PCIe 1x port !\n", "Q: What will happen if I bump the USB drive Ubuntu is running from? I am considering creating a Live Ubuntu USB drive and running Ubuntu just from it.\nSo, what bad things would happen if I was running Ubuntu and doing stuff and my flash drive got bumped out of socket?  I'm pretty certain that I'd lose whatever I hadn't saved, but what other corruptions or disasters might occur?  And are there settings that could be set to minimize the damage?\nCan anyone help me know the risks?  I'd rather not just wait and find out.\n\nA: It would be the same as removing your hard drive while your computer is on, most likely it will cause a crash that may not be recoverable from unless you reinstall.\nHere is one example\nI will add that this has happened to me and I had to reformat the flash drive and reinstall.\n\nA: That has happened to me before. I installed Ubuntu on a usb hard disk so I wouldn't have to wipe my windows installation off this computer. However, since it is a laptop, I often use it on the couch. So, one day I ended up accidentally unplugging the disk when I had to run for the phone. What happened was not a bluescreen-like crash as I expected. Instead, some weird things happened to the os. All the programs I had open stayed open in memory, although all of them began throwing errors whenever they tried to access storage. Unity also bugged up badly and eventually crashed. I wonder if a tool could be created that runs in memory and throws a system killswitch if this happens to me again. Either that or actually re-mounting the drive, if possible.\n", "Q: Sound icon missing from top menu The sound icon from the top menu bar is missing.

I have created a new sound device in PulseAudioPreferences and selected it from inidcator-sound-switcher but here I become stuck.\nThe sound is heading to the new sound device as the volume can be seen to go up and down from PulseAudioVolumeControl but no sound comes from the stereo downstairs.\nThe problem, as I see it, is the new device has no idea where to send the music as the Arcam hasn't been chosen from any program.\nSo - I installed BubbleUPNP and Plex. My music has been imported into the later and the former can see both the Arcam as a Renderer and the Plex as the Media Server.

Hopefully you have more luck.\n", "Q: avconv on multiple threads Is it possible to run jobs on multiple processor or threads to speed up avconv?\nIs there a feature in progress, if not I wonder why?\n\nA: If you are doing audio transcoding of lots of files, look into using GNU Parallel. It will take a list of files as input and process them in parallel based on the number of cores in your system. For example, here is a bash example that will convert music into the opus audio format in parallel using ffmpeg.\nfind ./* -depth -type f -name \\*.ogg -o -name \\*.flac -o -name \\*.m4a -o -name \\*.mp3 -o -name \\*.ogg | parallel -j+0 --gnu nice -n 19 ffmpeg -i \"{}\" -acodec libopus \"{.}.opus\" -loglevel quiet\n\n\nA: You are after the -threads option of avconv. Safest setting would be:\n -threads auto\n\nbut you can also set an integer there if you want to experiment a little. A modern FFmpeg (now the standard in Ubuntu) sets this is auto by default as seen in this section of the 'ffmpeg-all' man pages:\nthreads integer (decoding/encoding,video)\n\nSet the number of threads to be used, in case the selected\ncodec implementation supports multi-threading.\n\n  Possible values:\n\n     auto, 0\n     automatically select the number of threads to set\n\n Default value is auto.\n\nNote 2 important points:\n\n\n*\n\n*This setting will only have effect if the chosen codec supports multi-threading\n\n*It is possible to set the thread count for individual streams rather than simply attempt a global thread setting\n\n", "Q: Trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 on non-UEFI computer I am trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 from a USB bootable disk and I'm getting this error: \nubuntu install error /casper/vmlinuz.efi read error @ 0\n\nIt's a non-UEFI BIOS, so I'm guessing the error is appearing because Ubuntu install is booting into UEFI mode, if so how to make it boot into legacy mode?\nI tried renaming vmlinuz.efi to remove the .efi extension as I've seen some others do and that did nothing.\nThe error pops up twice, once before the language selection menu and again when I try to select an option like Try Ubuntu or install Ubuntu.\n\nA: I have just got Ubuntu working on my computer.

It has a LTS version based on Ubuntu 12.04. It is very small an fast (it is meant to be run from USB), you just have to check that you have all the applications you need.\n\nA: Yes, that's easy with Ubuntu, which actually has a tool installed by default to accomplish just that. It's name is usb-creator-gtk but the name is translated so if you just search for USB in the dash, you should be able to find it. If you're using another desktop such as with Lubuntu or Xubuntu, you'll find it in your system category of the application menu you're using. \nIn the window that appears, you'll just select the DVD image you wish to install from, such as ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso, then select the drive you wish to install to and choose the option to store changes. This space is limited to 4GB, so if you have a large memory stick and want to enable users to store more data, you may want to partition the USB device, adding a second file system that's mounted as /home. That can then be as large as the device can handle. \nIf it sounds complicated, it really isn't. And if you can live with the storage limitations in the GUI creator, it really is quite simple. \n\nA: Yes It is Possible but you need something bigger than a 8GB usb drive as ubuntu take 5GB at most with everything installed with it plus with some space so I would recommend something something above 16gb.   \n", "Q: How can I build a desktop rig with awareness of Linux driver support? I've been plagued by driver problems with each of the three laptops on which I've tried to install Ubuntu, usually because of Nvidia Optimus problems (somewhat solved by bumblebee but not quite).\nNow I'm thinking of investing in building a desktop, but I'm a bit afraid of doing so because I'm not sure if what I build will be able to support 3 screens and good audio output.\nHow can I choose my graphics cards and audio cards with to ensure good driver support with Linux?\nIs there an established way of checking compatibility other than looking things up on forums card by card?\nOr is this unnecessary, and support woes are more a laptop than a desktop problem?\n\nA: Laptops have more exotic hardware by nature & unless Ubuntu Certified, can be a gamble. Tower setups fare better especially if you stick to Intel hardware. You can always try System 76, otherwise Google is your friend. \n", "Q: xfce4-power-manager does not open I recently changed my DE from Unity to XFCE. I really enjoyed it, but the power manager doesn't work. When I try to open it from the settings menu, I get the following error:\nUnable to connect to Xfce Power Manager\n\nDid not receive a reply. Possible causes include: \nthe remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy\nblocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was\nbroken.\n\nWhen I try to run it from the command line, it simply does nothing. I found some other solutions where people said to try running xfce4-power-manager --no-daemon (here: xubuntu 13.10 xfce4-power-manager not working), but then I get the following messages:\n(xfce4-power-manager:23973): xfce4-power-manager-WARNING **: could not map keysym 1008ffa8 to keycode\n\n\n(xfce4-power-manager:23973): xfce4-power-manager-WARNING **: 'CheckAuthorization' failed with Action org.freedesktop.udisks.drive-set-spindown is not registered\n\nAnd then the shell halts until I hit ctrl+c.\nThen I read that this is a known bug and the best solution was to downgrade to a previous version of the power manager. I tried using aptitude for this, but it complained that every version I wanted did not exist, even if I was taking the version numbers from the xfce4-power-manager repository. The next thing I tried was to download the package and install it myself.

I have Ruby 2.0.0 installed on Ununtu 14.04 but I can't remove Ruby 1.9.1.

The snippet below will create symlinks in /usr/local/bin.\nfor i in erb gem irb rdoc ri ruby testrb; do\n    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/$i''2.0 /usr/local/bin/$i\ndone\n\nRuby 1.9.1 is still accessible by appending 1.9.1 to the binary name (for example, gem1.9.1).\n\nA: As an alternative to hand-maintaining multiple symlinks, I suggest using update-alternatives.

Don't worry - this is not the sterotypical \" how do I get my eyetoy working\" question.\nMy eyetoy works fine on Cheese, gucview and various other media software like VLC. However, It seems like I am capped by 25fps. If I recall, the eyetoy is much better than this (~60fps) but cannot find any way to fix this. The best program that I have have found is VLC because its advanced options allow you to change many settings but the framerate setting appears to have no effect.\nWhat software or settings can I use to take full advantage of my eyetoy?\nTo give you the full information I wish to attach multiple eyetoys to the system and record from all of them. (Security software like motion and zoneminder, I couldn't get installed correctly on my system- so I haven't tried those yet).\nedit - I tried the same camera on a Windows system and the frame rate is much better in VLC compared to the Ubuntu system. Mind you with default settings in Windows VLC, the resolution isn't great. However, in Skype for example the resolution is amazing and the framerate is good. It seems there must be some settings I am missing somewhere because it doesn't appear to be a hardware problem...\nedit2 - These images were taken seconds apart - top Ps2 eyetoy (better quality, worse framerate), bottom ps3 eyetoy (terrible quality, good framerate)\n\n\n\nA: The hardware specs for the Eyetoy are 320×240 @ 25fps. It's a really cheap and now very old camera. The Playstation Eye was somewhat better but far outside what you'd consider decent.\nI don't know what Skype is doing but I suspect it's a software effect.\nIn terms of security cameras, these might be okay (you might want lower resolution) but I'd consider something better at entry points. I could easily imagine people in 320×240 stills being unrecognisable and thus material being inadmissable. Here's a decent guide of what you should be aiming for.\n\nI've since bought a second hand Eyetoy and the picture quality on 14.04 is fine. The lens and sensor are awful examples of cheap hardware but the quality isn't nearly as bad as your example. Even in an otherwise pitch-black drawer (with just the red video light), it isn't grainy. Sound is good too.\n\nThat's from vlc v4l2:///dev/video0 :input-slave=\"alsa://hw:2,0\"\nBut the framerate is an issue. Through avconv I'm only getting 7 frames per second. Capturing in VLC only gets 7.5FPS. This side of things does look like a driver issue. It also looks like a regression in V4L2 because there are Ubuntu-recorded videos on Eyetoys that aren't that slow.\n", "Q: Deadlock-broken packages during Ubuntu 12.4 update: libjpeg-turbo8:amd64 and libjpeg-turbo8:i386 The problem\nI have not used my Ubuntu 12.4 (64 bit) netbook for about a year, and yesterday I tried to install one year worth of updates at once.

Now, it just hangs after a few minutes.\nI don't want to use or replace the hard drive, because I am using a flash drive to boot from. So, what I need to know is how to get rid of these errors, or tell Ubuntu to stop generating the errors.\n\nA: You could also try modifying the entry in /etc/fstab. The default for devices in there is rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async which means that if your device /dev/sda has an entry in /etc/fstab to mount /dev/sda1 then you should override the default behavior by putting noauto and maybe ro (read only) for the mount options and 0 for dump and 0 for fsck (file system check).  Might look something like this:\n/dev/sda1     /mnt/windows     noauto,ro     0     0\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Does deleting the /etc/fstab entry for /dev/sda not work or something? IIRC, mountall (utility to mount filesystems at boot) will still try to mount the filesystem at boot even if you have nobootwait.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to tell Linux to ignore a failing drive(1) without physically disconnecting it (2).\nLook at this question: How can I tell linux kernel to completely ignore a disk as if it was not even connected?\nThe kernel patch commented there is  included in kernel 3.13 and up, so in 14.04 you should be able to add the command line option to your kernel:\n libata.force=1.00:disable\n\nAnd the disk will be completely ignored(3). If you need help on adding kernel boot parameters, see How do I add a kernel boot parameter?\n\nFootnotes:\n(1) it was not possible ten months ago. Then I posted the linked question because I had a failing on board SDD, a kind kernel developer noticed it, added a patch to the kernel, and now I have a working system. This is the real power of Linux.\n(2) Although if you can, the best strategy is to physically get rid of it. No power drain, no noise...\n(3) note that, obviously, this means that the disk will not be accessible at all after the  boot. It will be as if it does not exist (and it means that for example, in your case,  the disk that was /dev/sdb it will be now /dev/sda and so on).

GNOME 3 doesn't either. So, where are these values stored? They are normally called \"application.desktop\" so to copy these to the desktop you only need:\n➜  ~  locate gparted.desktop ## Find where it's\n/usr/share/app-install/desktop/gparted.desktop\n/usr/share/applications/gparted.desktop # This is the default path for installed applications \n➜  ~  cp /usr/share/applications/gparted.desktop ~/Desktop # Done\n\nThis will make a copy on the desktop of the .desktop file, and should be interpreted as a \"shortcut\" to the program.\nMore about this in the specification page for .desktop files: http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ape.html\n\nA: Did some searching and came to the conclusion that this is, in fact, a bug in Unity and has been acknowledged by the Ubuntu developers - however, it doesn't seem as if anyone is currently working on it.

(General Practice Question) Hey Ubuntu community, \nI'm trying to get familiarized with system control on Linux distros on a small scale so that I may be able to carry the knowledge forward to work on HPCs in the near future. While I know that Ubuntu isn't the most common distro for scientific cluster computing and that clusters operate a little differently than that I'd be doing:\nIs it possible to run a desktop as a server (using the new Ubuntu server distro) and then use a different version of Ubuntu on a laptop to communicate with the server?

The complicated answer is \"as long as the server is set up correctly\".  Basically, install the Ubuntu Server version you want and set it up.  Without knowing your specific home network configuration, it is hard to give you specific details of how to sign in to the server.  However, I can attempt to give you same basic details.\n1) Install the server\nFairly self-explanatory here.  Install it, create the user accounts you need (I suggest having separate user accounts for the home user and the remote user).\n2) Set up your laptop.\nInstall whatever flavor of Ubuntu you want on the laptop.  The most current LTS is 14.04.  If you have older hardware, you may consider using 12.04 LTS.\n3) Set up your network\nI am going to make some assumptions here.  You have a modem that is hooked up to a router (or a combined modem/router) for your home network.  You will need to forward the ports for SSH. The standard is 22, but I suggest you change that.  Open a terminal and do this:\nsu                          #you will need to enter\n                            #your root password after this command\nnano /etc/ssh/sshd_config   #you could also use vi\n\nYou should see something similar to this:\n# Package generated configuration file\n# See the sshd_config(5) manpage for details\n\n# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for\nPort 22               #<- change this line to some other port (such as 6022)\n# Use these options to restrict which interfaces/protocols sshd will bind to\n\nThen restart the service:\nservice ssh restart\n\nRemember that port.  You will need it.\n4) Let's attempt to log in.\nOn your laptop, make sure you are connected to the internet and issue this command from a terminal:\nssh -p [port_number_you_entered_in_step_3] [ip_address_of_server] -l [username]\n\nWithout the brackets, of course.  If you set it up correctly, you should be able to log in to the server.  Once you are outside of your network, you can do the same thing, but you will need to change the ip address to your public IP address (which you can find by typing \"what is my ip address\" into a Google search from your home compuyter).\nThat should cover the basics.  Past that, you should ask any further questions over @ https://serverfault.com/.\n", "Q: installing rvm in 12.04 ubuntu which is on virtualbox I have tried a lot of methods but cant get this done. I am trying to install rvm on 12.04 ubuntu. There has been many problems in past like this and I have referred as much as I can and still nothing is working for me. Even wirting sudo in front of these doesnt work.\nWhat I tried are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*\\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby\n\n*curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable\n\n*curl -L raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer | bash -s stable\nI am able to ping each of them though.\nEverytime I get the this error:\ncouldn't connect to host\nOR\nnetwork is unreachable\nit looks like this:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ \\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0curl: (7) couldn't connect to host\n\nI already tried the solution proposed in Unable to install RVM using curl\nI am using NAT adapter for internet and wired connection.

I have an ASUS laptop that works fine: fast, no overheating etc. My problem is that the fans always run.\nI find this very annoying because in a silent room they are really loud\nHow can I control their speed? Maybe setting a lower fan speed will fix the problem?\nI started here:\n\n\n*\n\n*installed lm-sensors\n\n*installed fancontrol\n\n*ran sudo sensors-detect\n\n*this command outputs an error:\n$ sudo service module-init-tools restart\nmodule-init-tools: unrecognized service\n\nIs there any hope to fix these noisy fan sounds?\nAlso:\n$ fancontrol \nLoading configuration from /etc/fancontrol ...\nError: Can't read configuration file\n\n$ man fancontrol says: For easy configuration, there's a script named pwmconfig(8)\n...\n$ sudo pwmconfig \n[sudo] password for ionicabizau: \n# pwmconfig revision 6166 (2013-05-01)\nThis program will search your sensors for pulse width modulation (pwm)\ncontrols, and test each one to see if it controls a fan on\nyour motherboard. Note that many motherboards do not have pwm\ncircuitry installed, even if your sensor chip supports pwm.\n\nWe will attempt to briefly stop each fan using the pwm controls.\nThe program will attempt to restore each fan to full speed\nafter testing. However, it is ** very important ** that you\nphysically verify that the fans have been to full speed\nafter the program has completed.\n\n/usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no fan-capable sensor modules installed\n\n\nA: Those fans are there and triggered at that speed for a reason.  Trying to lower the fan speed just to reduce the noise might actually be harmful to your hardware causing it to overheat and then you are in a bad place!\nSounds like you are driving your CPU a bit ... try reducing the amount of active proceses and the total amount of CPU and then I believe the fan speed will lower.\nOne note, if your system is dirty or clogged on the inside this could potentially be causing the fan speed to be higher.\nSummary, change fan speed realizing the risk for serious hardware damage.\nIf the fans are noisy, replace them.  This is not a high cost part.\nAfter the fans, the HDD are the next thing to cause noise, afterall that is about the only other thing with moving parts.   In the past, I have had to eventually replace a noisy HD drive due to this.  I was afraid that the disk was going bad and wanted to avoid the pain and agony of a surprise situation.  My guess is that some of the bearings in the drive go out (just like the wheels in your car) and cause this obnoxious noise.\n", "Q: Make the zoom slider of Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 and 7000 scroll up and down, in 14.04 (Trusty) I tried to use this tutorial to make scroll switch work on my Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. But I face following error:\nsudo: /lib/udev/keymap: command not found\n\nI have udev version 204-5ubuntu20.2 (the version found in Trusty)\nI noticed that this version doesn't include keymap tool. But I notices that greater udev versions (which available for Debian, for example) include this tool.\nCould somebody explain this diff for me? =) And what should I do in this case - install package from Debian repo?\n\nA: The original solution posted by Oli did not work for me, but it works after I changed the key numbers \"0c022d\" and \"0c022e\" to \"c022d\" and \"c022e\". I'm using a 4000 model, so I can't verify if the same change is needed for the 7000 model.\nTo repeat Oli's answer, here is what I did: create a new file by running sudo nano /etc/udev/hwdb.d/61-keyboard-local.hwdb. Paste the following lines to the file (for the 4000 model):\nkeyboard:usb:v045Ep00DB*\n KEYBOARD_KEY_c022d=pageup\n KEYBOARD_KEY_c022e=pagedown\n\nAfter editing the file, recompile the hwdb that udev uses:\nsudo udevadm hwdb --update\n\nThen replug the keyboard.\n\nA: Adding to Oli's answer,\nIf you want line scrolling like how it is on a mouse, you can modify pageup/pagedown to up/down in your custom rule. Like:\nkeyboard:usb:v045Ep00DB*\n KEYBOARD_KEY_c022d=up\n KEYBOARD_KEY_c022e=down\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 15.10: I had no success with previous answers.\nI have successfully used approach similar to the previous ones - instructions were mentioned in /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb.\nI've created new hwdb file using sudo nano /etc/udev/hwdb.d/70-keyboard.hwdb\ncontaining:\n\n# Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 - remap zoom in/out to page up/down\nevdev:input:b0003v045Ep00DB*\n KEYBOARD_KEY_c022d=pageup\n KEYBOARD_KEY_c022e=pagedown\n\nafter that I've run\n\nsudo udevadm hwdb --update\nsudo udevadm control --reload\n\nand replugged the keyboard and it worked.\nFor model 7000 use \nevdev:input:b003v045Ep071D*\n\nA: If you look at /lib/udev/rules.d/60-keyboard.rules you'll see that everything has been messed around with. This is just part of the udev merger into systemd that has gone on. \nAll hardware rules are compiled into a binary hardware database. These follow a really strange format. The existing rules for keyboards that ship with udev live in /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb. Look at that but don't edit it (updates will probably overwrite it). \nTo add your custom rules, we'll create a new file in /etc/udev/hwdb.d/ by running sudoedit /etc/udev/hwdb.d/61-keyboard-local.hwdb. All you need to do is paste in the following -\nIf you are using the 4000 model:\nkeyboard:usb:v045Ep00DB*\n KEYBOARD_KEY_0c022d=pageup\n KEYBOARD_KEY_0c022e=pagedown\n\nIf you are using 7000 model:\nkeyboard:usb:v045Ep071D*\n KEYBOARD_KEY_0c022d=pageup\n KEYBOARD_KEY_0c022e=pagedown\n\nThis is adapated from the tutorial you posted so you might need to tweak based on your keyboard. Look at lsusb and make sure the vendor:product code above (as v####p####) is correct. It won't work if they don't match.\nOnce you're done editing, recompile the hwdb that udev uses:\nsudo udevadm hwdb --update\n\nAnd then you might need to re-plug. If it's a PS/2 keyboard you might need to reboot. In some cases you also need to reboot.\n\nA: Nice solution is here, and I can only add that you can map the keys to unused X keys like that:\n$ cat /lib/udev/rules.d/95-keymap.rules\n...\nENV{ID_VENDOR}==\"Microsoft\", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}==\"00db\", RUN+=\"keymap $name 0xc022d katakana 0xc022e katakanahiragana\n...\n\nProper names to use instead of katakana can be found here.\nAfter reboot ;-) you can test that zoomin and zoomout keys are mapped successfully, and also to find out a proper names of the keys (to use in rc.xml for OpenBox WM, for example) using xev:\n$ xev\n...\nKeyRelease event, serial 46, synthetic NO, window 0x3c00001,\n    root 0x291, subw 0x0, time 1492891, (-261,-61), root:(573,380),\n    state 0x0, keycode 101 (keysym 0xff27, Hiragana_Katakana), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n...\n\nNow you can connect new keys to completely arbitrary action. In my case of OpenBox window manager I used something like this:\n$ cat <whatever>/rc.xml\n...\n<keybind key=\"Katakana\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>volume_up.sh</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>\n<keybind key=\"Hiragana_Katakana\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>volume_down.sh</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>\n...\n\n", "Q: Nodejs Installation I have installed node.js and the version is 0.6.12.\nI am trying to update it but the efforts are in vain.

But am stuck doing this locally as i am relative rookie still in linux.\nI am using lubuntu 14.04. Thanks.\nnote: this is a public family computer and this query is to simplify and ease local  sharing of files and folders between each other.\n\nA: To make folders in your home directory available for other users on the same computer (read/write), basically you need to do three things. The procedure for Lubuntu is quite the same as for Ubuntu, apart from the difference in the file browser.\n1. Make other users member of the group: \"yourusername\"\n\n\n*\n\n*The GUI way is to install gnome-system-tools (NB: In Lubuntu, it already is installed) and use the users and groups -section. Manage groups > choose yourusername > properties > add the other users by checking their checkboxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The command line way (if you don't want to use / install gnome-system-tools) to add an existing user to group <yourname>, is:\n usermod -a -G <yourname> <user_to_add>\n\n2. Change the permissions of the folder you want to share:\nOn Ubuntu: right-click on the folder in nautilus and choose properties. In the permissions tab, change the group permissions for group yourusername to read & write.\nChange the permissions for the files in the folder similarly (the button down in the nautilus properties window).\n\nOn Lubuntu: Change the permissions for the folder you'd like to share to at least read & write permissions for owner & group:\n\n3.Set permissions for newly created files\nNow you can access the shared folder from the other user's account(s) with full privileges to create and edit files and directories. However, if other users create new files, those files will be owned by the user who created them. \nTo give read, write and execute permissions (if the file is executable) on newly created files to all members of the group, there is still one thing left to do: run in a terminal (from the folder's owner account):\nchmod g+s <shared folder>\n\n\nA: You could try \nchmod 777 -R /home/youruser\n\nBut this is dangerous (it's not your / directory, but still).  If it's for local sharing, etc.  You could try setting up a samba share instead.\n", "Q: PL2303 attached to ttyUSB0 -> Change it to ttyS*?

I added my user to that group using \nsudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>\nAfter that I had permission to access the USB and Serial ports. Now terminal-programs like moserial work. But I still can't access the status lines using statserial. Instead I get that message:\ngernot@gernot-Lenovo-G505s:~$ statserial ttyUSB0\nstatserial: can't open device `ttyUSB0': No such file or directory\n\nUpdate 2:\nI managed to make statserial work (the sense of this thread will collapse I guess):\nFirst you have to reset the port and then establish a hard link to a ttyS*-port with a higher number than the number of standard ports are:\nsudo rm /dev/ttyS40\nsudo ln /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyS40 \n\nBut how can I copy the data displayed in terminal into any object i can read with selfmade code? And why is the statserial-tool reacting so slowly to changed staus lines?\n\nA: Your first issue (device permissions) was fixed by adding your user to the correct group.\nYour second issue (device path) seems to be that you are not using the full device path. From man statserial:\n\nThe optional device-name parameter is the full name of the device file for the serial port  in  question. If not specified, the default is taken from the environment variable MODEM if set, otherwise /dev/cua1.\n\nSo you need to do statserial /dev/ttyUSB0\n(I checked the source to verify this is correct, it literally does fd = open(device,...) where device is your argv[x])\nFor generic information about programming the serial port see Serial Programming HOWTO. You can look at the source of statserial with apt-get source statserial (it is a very simple program compiled from a single file statserial.c which is 195 lines long).\nThe update is slow because statserial only polls the serial port every second, the main loop is:\n  for (;;) {\n\n    /* get modem status info */ \n    status = ioctl(fd, TIOCMGET, &arg);\n    if (status != 0) {\n      perror(\"statserial: TIOCMGET failed\");\n      exit(1);\n    }\n\n...\n    printw(\"Device: %s\\n\\n\", device);\n    printw(\"Signal  Pin  Pin  Direction  Status  Full\\n\");\n    printw(\"Name    (25) (9)  (computer)         Name\\n\");\n    printw(\"-----   ---  ---  ---------  ------  -----\\n\");\n    printw(\"FG       1    -      -           -   Frame Ground\\n\");\n    printw(\"TxD      2    3      out         -   Transmit Data\\n\");\n    printw(\"RxD      3    2      in          -   Receive  Data\\n\");\n    printw(\"RTS      4    7      out         %1d   Request To Send\\n\", !!(arg & TIOCM_RTS));\n    printw(\"CTS      5    8      in          %1d   Clear To Send\\n\", !!(arg & TIOCM_CTS));\n    printw(\"DSR      6    6      in          %1d   Data Set Ready\\n\", !!(arg & TIOCM_DSR));\n    printw(\"GND      7    5      -           -   Signal Ground\\n\");\n    printw(\"DCD      8    1      in          %1d   Data Carrier Detect\\n\", !!(arg & TIOCM_CAR));\n    printw(\"DTR     20    4      out         %1d   Data Terminal Ready\\n\", !!(arg & TIOCM_DTR));\n    printw(\"RI      22    9      in          %1d   Ring Indicator\\n\", !!(arg & TIOCM_RNG));\n    refresh();\n\n    /* break out if -n option was used */\n    if (n_option)\n      exit(0);\n\n    /* delay 1 second between loops */\n    sleep(1);\n  }\n\nIf you are doing any serious work with serial ports, I would highly recommend that you get a real serial port card (PCI card with RS232 controller on it). The USB adaptors are not reliable enough, especially if you are linking to old hardware, you will find that they do not reproduce the signal timings accurately, which will cause problems with some devices. Another common problem is that the USB serial ports don't implement (or badly implement) hardware RTS/CTS handshaking, and thus end up being incompatible with old serial port devices. Having said that, the PL2303 is one of the better chips, and should work with most devices.\n\nA: I don't know about statserial (and I know this is an old question), but if you want to have a custom device name, you can drop a file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ like this one (mine is named 98-devicename.rules):\nSUBSYSTEM==\"tty\" ATTRS{idVendor}==\"067b\" ATTRS{idProduct}==\"2303\" SYMLINK+=\"devicename%n\" MODE:=\"0666\"\n\nThis will match the USB ID/vendor and allow all users to access without being in dialout group (MODE). It will also create a symlink /dev/devicename0 -> /dev/ttyUSB0 assuming it is the first of both. If you had a different device with a different USB chipset (e.g. a Cypress one) already plugged in, it might be the first of this chipset, so /dev/devicename0 -> /dev/ttyUSB1. By having udev handle the symlinks, you don't need to worry about it being plugged into a different port, etc - devicename0 should always be the first device that uses that chipset.\nTo find more things that you can match, see udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/ttyUSB0).\n\nA: As for how to connect custom code to serial ports, since I commonly use Python, I would recommend checking out the pySerial library https://wiki.python.org/moin/PySerial\n", "Q: SSH behind a NAT enabled router I have a netgear router, and i installed openssh, now when i try \nssh deadman@192.168.0.4\n\nMy ssh works fine and i am able to enter to the ssh terminal\nBut when i try it with a remote terminal like \nssh deadman@117.192.213.115\n\nI dont see anything , \nif i try \ndeadman -W deadman@117.192.213.115\n\ni get \nBad stdio forwarding specification 'deadman@117.192.213.115'\n\nnote that 117.192.213.115 is my routers ip - \nand in my router settings i have enabled port forwarding  - \n\n\nA: *\n\n*Try pinging your IP. Does the IP actually exist? (It didn't when I tried and you getting no response whatsoever suggests your IP may have changed).\n\n*Maybe your router needs to be rebooted for the settings to take effect?\n\n*Maybe your ISP blocks port 22. In that case try forwarding your internal port 22 to another external port and then use ssh deadman@<your IP>:<port>\nTip: You shouldn't publicly mention your WAN-facing IP-address. You'll just invite less friendly folks to try and break in. \nIf you are not sure whether your ISP blocks a certain port, you might want to test that by visiting the site grc.com. Once there find their service called \"Shields Up!\". That lets you test your router and they also have a port probe showing you which ports are open/closed/stealthed. If port 22 shows closed or stealthed while it is being forwarded it's likely being blocked somewhere upstream. Try a higher portnumber (>10 000)\n", "Q: HUD not working in LibreOffice downloaded from libreoffice.org As I want all the latest software for my computer, I downloaded LibreOffice from the site, not from Software Center. I followed the instructions on how to install it. I have only one problem; the alt function, which has the ability of fast finding the meny entry or function inside the program, does not work. Here's an example of that function in Chrome:\n\nHowever, if I do that in LibreOffice, I get nothing:\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: LibreOffice in Ubuntu 14.04's repositories is already the latest version, so you already had the latest version installed when you installed Ubuntu 14.04.\nThe HUD features come only from Ubuntu's LibreOffice packages as they ship their own patches for software to use the HUD.\nPS: Install libreoffice-style-sifr, it looks a lot prettier than the human icon theme.\n", "Q: When is disk fragmentation an issue and how does one fix it? My ext4 drive recently filled up to 95 percent capacity before I cleared out space on my disk. While transferring files from my computer to an external hard drive, I noticed a lot of my oldest media transferred fairly quickly, while some of the newer material was copying at a much slower rate. (It also seemed to stall or pause often.) Could this be due to fragmentation? If so, what is the optimal solution for maintaining good disk health?\n\nA: If you have too much disk space in use, ext4 cannot defrag that well so you will suffer from fragmentation at the end of the drive. Furthermore, when you write data to a hard drive, writes start at the outermost part of the magnetic platters which are faster than the innermost part at the end of the drive.\nI would recommend using btrfs with compress=lzo as a mount option to both shrink the size of your compressible data and speed up transfer rates. I wouldn't recommend using Ext4 anymore considering it is slower than both Btrfs and XFS.\n", "Q: how to extract multiple zipped and rar files recursively? I have a folder ExampleFolder which contains many zipped folders. These zipped folders also contains multiple zipped folders. How to go through ExampleFolder and extract all of its zipped folders recursively? \nNote that ExampleFolder itself, is not zipped, it's just a normal folder\nOkay now I know what's happening Rinzwind and nux answers are both correct (except that I have to keep pressing Y or A forever)\nBut it's seems that some of the zipped files, contained zipped files and rar files as well, the rar files will not be extracted by \nwhile [ \"`find . -type f -name '*.zip' | wc -l`\" -gt 0 ]; do find -type f -name \"*.zip\" -exec unzip -- '{}' \\; -exec rm -- '{}' \\;; done \n\nor whatever\nEdit 2 Some files are named .r00 and r01, .r02 up to r14, they are rar files, but not .rar\n\nA: You can use this command , it will recursively unzip all files in your current directory .\nNote This will delete original zipped files , but If you want to leave original files , delete -exec rm -- '{}' \\; code .\nCommand : \nwhile [ \"`find . -type f -name '*.zip' | wc -l`\" -gt 0 ]; do find -type f -name \"*.zip\" -exec unzip -- '{}' \\; -exec rm -- '{}' \\;; done \n\n\nA: The simplest way I can imagine is to extract the zip, then extract what was inside.\nSay, in ExampleFolder you had Example-A.zip. Just extract the .zips out of Example-A.zip (presumably into a folder named Example-A-Folder), then extract each of them one-by-one. This can be troublesome in cases where compressing it recursively (on Windows, something like Example.zip.zip.zip would crop up) leads to a compressed folder inside another inside another, etc.\n", "Q: Change keyboard layout permanently in Xubuntu 14.04 I have a fresh Xubuntu 14.04 Trusty Thar installation (not upgrade) and I need to change my keyboard layout each time I boot.\nThese are the contents of file /etc/default/keyboard:\nXKBMODEL=\"pc105\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"es\"\nXKBVARIANT=\"cat\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp\"\n\nIt seems correct to me, but the layout does not follow this file.\n\nMethod #1 tried to apply configuration permanently\nEach time I boot I got US keyboard layout.

I tried to make sense of it but my head exploded. Then I thought I had got it so I tried writing it down and my head exploded again. (see summary of implementations) I thought it will be useful to post this here as there were many stackexchange questions asking about pairwise comparisons between them.\nSummary of what to use when:\n\n\n*\n\n*ZRAM if you have no swap device on HDD/SSD.\n\n*ZSWAP if you do have a swap device on HDD/SSD.\n\n*ZCACHE: It does what ZSWAP does and ALSO compresses and speeds the filesystem page cache. (It is internally much more complicated and is not in the mainline kernel as it is still under development).\n\n\nSummary of their implementations:\n\n\n*\n\n*ZRAM is a compressed RAM based swap device\n\n*ZSWAP is a compressed Cache if you already have a swap.\n\n*ZCache is a backend for a special type of Virtual RAM thingy (Transcendent memory) that can be used to cache filesystem pages or swap data.\n\n\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*ZRAM:  Makes a swap device in the RAM. Pages sent here are compressed as they are stored. It has a higher priority than other swap devices: pages that are swapped out are preferentially sent to the zram device till it is full, only then are any other swap devices used.\n\n\n*\n\n*Benefits: Independent of other (physical) swap devices. It can be used when there is no swap partition to expand the available memory.\n\n*Disadvantages: If other swap devices (HDD/SSD) are present they are not used optimally. As the zram device is an independent swap device, once it is full, any new pages that need to be swapped out are sent to next swap device directly, hence:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a real chance of LRU (least recently used) inversion: It will be the most recently swapped data that goes to the slow disk, while inactive pages that were swapped out long ago will remain in the fast ZRAM\n\n*The data sent to and read from the disk will consume a lot of bandwidth as it is uncompressed.\n\n\n*Status: Merged into the mainline kernel 3.14. Once enabled on a system, it requires some userspace configuration to set up the swap devices and use them.\n\n\n*ZSWAP: The frontswap system hooks attempts to swap out pages and uses zswap as write-back-cache for a HDD/SSD swap device: An attempt is made to compress the page and if it contains poorly compressible data it is directly written to the disk. If the data is compressed, it is stored in the pool of zswap  memory. If pages are swapped out of memory when the total compressed pages in RAM exceeds a certain size, the Least Recently Used (LRU) compressed page is written to the disk as it is unlikely to be required soon.\n\n\n*\n\n*Benefits: Very efficient use RAM and disk based swap. Minimizes Disk I/O by both reducing the number of writes and reads required (data is compressed and held in RAM) and by reducing the bandwidth of these I/O operations as the data is in a compressed form.\n\n*Limitations: It is an enhancement of disk based swap systems and hence depends on a swap partition on the hard disk.\n\n*Status: Merged into the 3.11 mainline linux kernel.\n\n\n*ZCache: It is a backend for the Transcendent memory system. Transcendent memory provides a RAM-like memory that can only be accessed a page at a time by using put and get calls. This is unlike normal memory that can be accessed a byte at a time. The frontswap and cleancache systems hook attempts to swap and reclaim file-system page caches respectively and send them to the transcendent memory backends. When zcache is used as a backend, the data is compressed and stored in the RAM. When it fills up, compressed pages are evicted to the swap. (an alternate backend is RAMster which shares a pool of RAM across networked computers).\nUsing only the frontswap frontend with the zcache backend works just like zswap. (In fact zswap is a simplified subset of zcache)\n\n\n*\n\n*Benefits Provides compressed caching both for swap and for filesystem caches.\n\n*Status: Still not mainlined as it is very complicated and is being worked on.\n\n\n\nThe best resources I found were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transcendent memory in a nutshell\n\n*[PATCH 0/8] zswap: compressed swap caching\n\n*In-kernel memory compression\n\n*LSFMM: In-kernel memory compression\n\n*The zswap compressed swap cache\n\n", "Q: SSL Connection to Apache web server I follow up on setting up SSL connection to my Apache2\nIt works well when I access my website from a local IP address\nbut if I use a Dynamic DNS service with HTTPS in the beginning than\nI doesn't get to the website but actually can see my website folders.\nWhat have I done wrong ?\n\nA: Is the port 443 in your router redirected to the host you have the server running on?

I was using Ubuntu 14.04 when due to power interruption, my computer was shut down. On reboot, it was corrupted and I lost all my data.I want to reinstall Ubuntu again, is there any way,other than uninterrupted power supply, to make Ubuntu resistant to corruption of data,so that such things don't happen in future? \n\nA: \nand I lost all my data\n\nThis to me seems to show a lack of understanding operating systems. You erased all your data when installing a new operating system over the current one. If you wanted to save it I assume you could have with a live dvd. We will never know but only if your hard disc actually died and got replaced you loose your data. Besides that: if you had installed without formatting most of your personal data would have been there after installing.  Maybe there would be a file that was damaged (but that probably only happens if it was written to disc at the moment of the power failure).\n\nto make Ubuntu resistant to corruption of data\n\nYou might use another filesystem than ext. Both btrfs and ZFS claim \"protection against data corruption\" but I am not sure if the do a better job than ext. Journaling systems do not have a habit losing data, killing your system beyond repair. \nThe biggest risk is your hard disc itself. That can have a malfunction (like broken heads).\n\nThe best method to prevent data loss is and has always been to backup important files.\n\nA: The least expensive way to prevent significant data loss is indeed regular backups and/or off site backups. Another way to protect against data loss due to disk failure is to run a fault tolerant disk configuration such as RAID 1 (A simple disk mirroring configuration.) or RAID 5 (This is a more common configuration for servers requiring large high performance data storage systems that is minimally impacted by loss of a single disk.).\nAs power failure seems to be your prime concern, a UPS would definitely be your best solution. Combined with regular backups you can drop your risk of data loss significantly. Note that there is virtually nothing an OS or even the hardware can do to prevent incomplete data writes (Which can cause corrupted files.) to the hard drive due to power failure on it's own, support of a UPS that allows the system to complete it's task before powering down is required.\n", "Q: I'd like to edit the window style for gVim is that possible?

I then changed GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET to true, updated the grub, restarted the computer, and saw that, although grub timeout was set to 0, it hanged there for about 3 secinds. How to remove it? I don't care about recovery options, I don't need them, since my ubuntu is working great and I backup it regulary. I also tried one program for configuring grub, and it didn't work.\n\nA: I managed to cut down the grub time to about 1s, which is ok for me, by changing the following line(commenting):\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\nto\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\n", "Q: Changing icon font size/colour in 14.04 How can I change the desktop icon font size/colour to something more readable? At the moment, icon text looks like this:\n\nunity-tweak-tool (as mentioned in How do I change fonts and adjust their size?) has no way of changing these settings. Any of the questions from older Ubuntu distros are not relevant under 14.04.\nUpdate: from Change default system font using terminal only in 14.04, I can change the font/size with something like:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.desktop font 'Ubuntu Bold 12'\n\nI'm still at a loss how to change the colour of the text, though.\n\nA: Font colors are usually attributes of the themes. \nI'd first try not to mess around to much and hence install another theme and try what fits my needs.\nIf you want to go all geek mode and fiddle around you will find the themes under \n/usr/share/themes/<theme-name>/\n\nThere you will usually find a gtk-3.0 folder, in which you will find all the files of the theme. \nThe files you are looking for are either gtk.css or settings.ini respectively both of them. \nIf you are familiar with css, you'll have no problem configuring your style as you wish to. \nThe interesting part for you might look like this, depending on the theme designer: \n/* default color scheme */\n@define-color bg_color #ffffff;\n@define-color fg_color #4c4c4c;\n@define-color base_color #ffffff;\n@define-color text_color #ff2525;\n@define-color selected_bg_color #cce8ff;\n@define-color selected_fg_color #262626;\n@define-color tooltip_bg_color #ffffff;\n@define-color tooltip_fg_color #4c4c4c;\n@define-color progressbar_color #06B025;\n\nAs you can see, colors are defined for different parts of an application, so you might have to try and find out which one you need to be changed.\nTo use the theme on your unity desktop, you will have to install unity-tweak-tool. It's also very handy because you can swith back and forth between themes and directly view your changes, once you saved them on the theme css file.\nAs a little bonus, you might find this article about theming in Unity very interesting: \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/Theming\n", "Q: juju spends bootstrap-timeout with a final message it cannot find /var/lib/juju/nonce.txt \n*\n\n*I build two VMware's machines.

Think of Ubuntu and windows as 2 different people in a room. They know nothing of each other. Except that you can mount windows drive with Ubuntu but that doesn't mean it will affect windows unless you personally do something on the drive.\n\nA: No, because Windows can't write to Ubuntu's formatted disks (usually ext[2|3|4]) because it doesn't have the appropriate drivers (unless you use something like ext2fs).\nHowever, if you sign in the same Google Account on both Chrome(/Chromium) installations, settings, bookmarks, passwords etc. will be synced.\n\nA: No, it can't, as Windows cannot open the Ubuntu partition (by default). Something else is slowing down Windows.

That's your home directory, not the root directory. In a shell command (and in many other applications), your home directory can be represented with the abbreviation ~ (a tilde character). File names are case-sensitive; it's Desktop, not desktop.\nsudo mv ~/Desktop/Viva /usr/share/themes\n\n\nA: There is no /Desktop directory, but each user account has a $HOME/Desktop directory. You will need to specify the full path to the file, and because you are using sudo you cannot use a ~ abbreviation or it will look in the root users /Desktop directory which doesn't exist rather than the user's home directory.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In terminal type sudo mv /home/user-name/desktop/Viva /usr/share/themes. You will need to substitute user-name with the user name of the account you are using.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*When copying files that don't require the use of sudo you can abbreviate the path of the current users home directory with a ~ in front. Eg: cd ~/Desktop. This only works for the user account under which the command is run. So if user Example runs the command then it will look in /home/Example/Desktop.\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between an NVIDIA legacy binary proprietary driver and a binary only proprietary driver? What is the difference between an NVIDIA legacy binary proprietary driver and a binary only proprietary driver?\n\nA: Basically, the difference between the two drivers is that the legacy drivers are intended for the video cards which are no longer supported by Nvidia in the official driver (thankfully, Nvidia's support is just awesome. You're only out of luck with truly ancient hardware that's like more than 8 years old). The legacy driver is not as well maintained as the newest driver and generally only receives important bugfixes. It will no longer receive new features or optimizations for new games or applications as is the case with the normal driver. \nSo, it is highly advised to always use the normal drivers if they are available. This way you will have the best experience and support. If you are unsure if your card is still supported by the latest driver, here is a link with a list of supported video cards (click on the tab called \"Supported Products\"):\nhttp://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/75067/en-uk\n", "Q: my localhost default page welcome me on nginx I am again getting frustrated by my nginx server.

You can just install the latest version of the drivers (which is the second to last one called nvidia-331-updates in the screenshot). When the drivers are installed, you should be able to access the Nvidia settings panel. In there, there is a tab called PRIME profiles, where you can switch between Intel (Power Saving) and NVIDIA (Performance).\nThe only downside is that you need to log out and back in in order to apply the changes.\n\nA: Nvidia prime works far better than Bumblebee and unlike the former, to enable or disable the card just needs log out and login rather than a reboot. Also performance is far better with full HDMI out support with audio.\n", "Q: Google Chrome 35 - Protected Flash Content Since I upgraded to Google Chrome 35 it can no longer play protected flash content.

The construction while IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' filename; do .... done < <(find \"$1\" -type f -print0) is safe against all file names.\nbasename is no longer used because we are looking at files within subdirectories and we need to keep the subdirectories.  So, in place of the call to basename, the line fn=${filename#$1} is used.  This just removes from filename the prefix containing directory $1.\nProblem 2\nSuppose that we match files by name but regardless of directory.  In other words, if the first directory contains a file a/b/c/some.txt, we will consider it present in the second directory if file some.txt exists in any subdirectory of the second directory.  To do this replace the loop above with:\nwhile IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' filename\ndo\n  fn=$(basename \"$filename\")\n  if ! find \"$2\" -name \"$fn\" | grep -q . ; then\n      echo \"$fn is missing from $2\"\n      missing=$((missing + 1))\n  fi\ndone < <(find \"$1\" -type f -print0)\n\n\nA: FSlint is a small GUI application that helps you identify and clean your system of redundant files.\nInstalling FSlint\nInstall FSlint from the Ubuntu Software Center, or from the command line as follows:\nsudo apt-get install fslint\n\n(On my system, installing FSlint did not pull in additional dependencies.  Specifically, fslint depends on findutils, python, and python-glade2, which should all be on your system already. You can remove FSlint using the Software Center or by typing sudo apt-get autoremove --purge fslint in a terminal).\nSearching for Files\nLaunch FSlint from the Unity Dash.\nHere is a screen-shot of the main screen.  There are many advanced features, but basic usage of the application is relatively straightforward.\nClick the Add button at the top left to add all the directories you would like to check.  Obviously, you can remove directories using the Remove button.\n\nMake sure the recurse? check-box at the the right is selected.  Then click the Find button.  (Any errors, such as file permission issues, will be printed at the bottom of the FSlint window).\nFSlint will list all of the duplicate files, their directory locations, and the file date.  FSlint also presents you with the number of bytes wasted due to the redundant files.\nRemoving Duplicates\nNow you can select multiple files using the Shift or Ctrl keys and left mouse button.  If you want to select multiple files automatically, click on the Select button and you will be given options such as selecting files based on date, or entering wild card selection criteria.\nIf you need to use the list of selected files outside of FSlint (perhaps as input to your own script) click on the Save button to save a text file.\nFinally you can delete the selected files using the Delete button, or you can merge the selected files using the Merge button.  Note that the Merge feature removes the unselected files from your system and creates hard links to the corresponding selected files.  You would use this feature if you wanted to keep your existing file structure, but wanted to free up some space on your system.\n\nAdditional Features & Documentation\nFSlint has other powerful features which are accessible from the tabs in the left pane.  I have found Name clashes to be useful where there are files that have the same name, but are different (perhaps because you saved a newer version of a file in a different directory).\nThere is also an Advanced search parameters tab at the top of the FSlint window that allows you to exclude certain directories in your search, or filter your results using parameters.\nThere a re a lot of powerful features in this simple little tool.  It may save you the effort of having to write and debug a script.  You can find out more at http://www.pixelbeat.org/fslint/.  Here is a direct link to the English guide: http://en.flossmanuals.net/fslint/.\n\nA: I want to share this way because I think it is quite fun.\nFor each subfolder below the target folder, we generate a hash for that subfolder.\nEach folder hash is generated from the result of hashing all the files below that folder.  So any folder containing identical files in the same structure should produce the same hash!\nAt the end, we use uniq to display only the duplicate folder hashes.\nSave the following script as seek_duplicate_folders.sh and then run it like this:\n$ bash seek_duplicate_folders.sh [root_folder_to_scan]\n\nHere is the script:\n#!/bin/bash\ntarget=\"$1\"\n\nhash_folder() {\n  echo \"Hashing $1\" >/dev/stderr\n  pushd \"$1\" >/dev/null\n\n  # Hash all the files\n  find . -type f | sort | xargs md5sum |\n\n  # Hash that list of hashes, discard the newline character,\n  # and append the folder name\n  md5sum - | tr -d '\\n'\n  printf \"  %s\\n\" \"$1\"\n\n  popd >/dev/null\n}\n\nfind \"$target\" -type d |\nwhile read dir\ndo hash_folder \"$dir\"\ndone |\nsort |\n# Display only the lines with duplicate hashes (first 32 chars are duplicates)\nuniq -D -w 32\n\nCaveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inefficient: it md5sums files deep in the tree multiple times (once per ancestor folder)\n\n*Does not detect differences in file timestamps, ownership or permissions\n\n*Ignores empty folders.  So two folders which contain identical files, or no files, but have different empty folders inside them, will still be reported as identical.\n\n*Ignores symlinks.  Files containing different symlinks may still be reported as identical.\n\n", "Q: Sensor identification When I run sensors I get:\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +56.0°C  (crit = +102.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nPhysical id 0:  +55.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 0:         +50.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 1:         +52.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\nI have a quad-core i5 processor.\nHow do I identify what Physical id 0 and temp1 stand for?\n\nA: Physical id 0 is your CPU\nCore0 is your first individual core\nCore1 is your second individual core\n\nA: From (tomshardware.com - Is Intel i5 Dual Core or Quad Core?) you get this answer:\n\ni5-750 is a quad core, all other i5s are dual cores, albeit with\n  hyperthreading.\n\nThat answer is from 2010 but you get the point.

Now I installed my USB wifi card driver which was for XP 64bit.\nAnother restart and bam:\n\nSo what is this and how can I recover from this?\nBooting Ubuntu in recovery mode will produce the same error.\n\nA: This is probably due to a bug in the driver or in ndiswrapper. Have you Googled, to see if other people have had success using ndiswrapper with that same device/driver?\nTo recover, basically: boot a Live CD, chroot into your installation, remove offending driver. Say your root partition is /dev/sda1, then after booting the Live CD, do\n\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo mount -t proc none /mnt/proc\nsudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash\n\n(If the second command fails, it's probably because you mounted the wrong partition in the first one.) This will give you a root shell in your installed system, in which you can remove the offending driver from ndiswrapper, or even uninstall ndiswrapper altogether. When you are done, exit from the chrooted shell, unmount everything:\n\nsudo umount /mnt/proc\nsudo umount /mnt/dev\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nand reboot normally.\n\nA: You should remove the driver you installed with ndiswarapper.

Please tell me how I can stop the errors and get aero working, that's all I really need to know right now.\n\nA: The ability to run Aero will depend on your host system's graphics ability, which must exceed the requirements for Aero as running in it a VM requires more resources than running it on a host. You will need Vmware Tools installed on the guest, 3D graphics support enabled in the VM's settings, and you should run a system assessment to get a Windows Experience Index Rating in Windows.

I understand the main principle that local configuration files precede global /etc/ configuration files. What I really need though is some more detail on this because sometimes it's not obvious. \nThe example I'd like to know an implicit answer for would be for the following PostgreSQL config files:  /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf and /usr/share/postgresql/9.3/pg_hba.conf.\n\nA: PostgreSQL won't read and merge pg_hba.conf.

Best course of action is to reinstall Mac OS X.  Once it is installed, you can run the Boot Camp Assistant in Utilities to partition the HD to your liking.  Keep in mind that it will ask for a Windows OS DVD. Simply follow the prompts to install.  When the Mac reboots, quickly hold down the 'option' key on your keyboard to bring up the Startup Manager.  From here, eject the Windows Disc, and put in the Ubuntu disc and select it to boot the Ubuntu disc.  Then follow the prompts as usual.

This should be pretty easy using Ubuntu and a USB drive large enough to hold the files.\nSecond, I doubt there is any way to remove an installed program on the Windows side of a dual-boot system using Linux. There are registry edits you'd need to do at the very least. Ask someone who's tried to uninstall Norton from XP from inside XP!\n\nA: I'm not familiar with this particular product, but you could always try booting Windows XP in safe mode, then uninstalling the product. As for your Ubuntu method, this is a no go because Ubuntu can't run windows software without wine, and wine breaks native installations. At best you could theoretically use Ubuntu to delete enough of the program to disable it, allowing you to boot in and uninstall it, but that's risky and could just as easily make things worse.

I commented out the entry for wired ethernet card and left only the one for the loopback interface and it worked. \nI think that it was probably the entry for the wired ethernet card in the interfaces file that was causing the problem. I think that this was done in the initial install as I didn't add it. My guess that this was causing the system to waiting for the wired interface to come up but it eventually timed out and then continued with the boot and that commenting out the entry leaves it to the Network Manager to handle the network and it switches over to the wireless card once it determines that the wired card isn't connected.\n", "Q: Possible to run gksudo without a password require?

Why  do we use sudo to perform a terminal command as an administrative? Why isn't it  admin or something else? Is there a reason for sudo?\n\nA: From Wikipedia:\n\nsudo  is a program for Unix-like\n  computer operating systems that allows users to run programs with the\n  security privileges of another user (normally the superuser, or\n  root). Its name is a concatenation of \"su\" (substitute user) and\n  \"do\", or take action.\nUnlike the su command, users typically supply their own password to\n  sudo rather than the root password. After authentication, and if the\n  /usr/local/etc/sudoers (sometimes found at /etc/sudoers) configuration\n  file permits the user access, then the system will invoke the\n  requested command. The sudoers configuration file enables a huge\n  amount of configurability, including but not limited to: enabling root\n  commands only from the invoking terminal; not requiring a password for\n  certain commands; requiring a password per user or group; requiring\n  re-entry of a password every time or never requiring a password at all\n  for a particular command line. It can also be configured to permit\n  passing arguments or multiple commands, and even supports commands\n  with regular expressions.\n\nIts a temporary one-time command with superuser (administrator) privileges without direct root login.\n\nA: superuser do\nThere's a command, su, for becoming the superuser, so you might say\n$ su\n# apt-get install somehorror\n# exit\n$\n\nsudo lets you do that in one swoop, and you don't have to remember to renounce your magic powers.\n$ sudo apt-get install somehorror\n\n\nA: Whether \"superuser\" is what su  originally derived from, it is inaccurate since the username you give it doesn't have to be a superuser. Ditto for executing commands as another user using sudo -u.\n\"Substitute user\" is more accurate, but sounds clunky. It makes me think of a substitute teacher.\nTherefore I prefer to think of su as simply \"switch user\" and sudo thus as \"switch user & do\".\n\nA: Regarding why it isn't \"admin\" -- or more indirectly, why su isn't \"switchUser\" or something like that -- Traditional Unix commands tend to be minimal abbreviations for historical reasons having to do with Unix's origins.\nFor the most basic reason we need to go back to the same reason it's called Unix in the first place. Much of Unix was inspired by one of the early multiuser multitasking operating systems, MIT's Multics. (Unix gets its name either as \"the singular of Multics\" or \"castrated Multics\", depending on who you ask and their mood at the moment.)\nAmong Multics' other innovations, it introduced the concept of separating the actual file location from the directory information, allowing a single file to have multiple names. (\"Links\", in Unix terms.) Multics took (overly) full advantage of this; most Multics commands have both ALongNameThatIsImpossibleToType and ASNTOECR (a short name that only experts can remember). Experience showed that the long names really didn't add much user-friendliness since, realistically, at that time all users were or quickly became \"experts\" and almost nobody ever used the long names. When Unix adopted some of Multics' design, one of their simplifications was to discard the unused long names and keep only the expert-friendly short names.\nThis also fit well with the Unix philosophy of reducing the operating system and its core command set to their essentials, permitting it to run efficiently on smaller systems. In those days programmers were still conserving every byte and cycle possible. Processors were tremendously slower, terminal speeds were likewise tremendously slower, and memory was tremendously more expensive (and slower, and had tiny caches if any). Keeping system commands down to a minimal length may not have actually saved much (if any) real resources, but it \"felt right\" for the mindset of the time.\nIf you really insist upon user-friendly command names, the Unix answer would be \"You know how to write a shell script; implement it yourself. If you don't know how to write a shell script, you need to learn how to do so. If you don't like learning and/or coding, you're not going to be happy with Unix and should use something else.\"\n\nA: \nBefore sudo, most administrators were logged-in as the root user because it is an easy way to configure your system, as you have all the rights. However, a small mistake, or a wrong internet link and your whole system could be affected or even compromised.\nDue to this problem, sudo appeared. The aim was to use administrative privileges only for a short period of time, and only when required. In addition, this would avoid the user logging into another account. This would obviously enhance the system safety.\nUnder Ubuntu, they choose to enhance the safety of your system. Thus, they decided to follow the ‘sudo’ way. The root user is disabled; there is no need for it and especially no risk that a user logged-in via the X interface with the root user. In addition, they've allowed every command to be launched with sudo for authorized users. The cool thing is that power-users can access the root account.\nDrawbacks of sudo :\n\n\n*\n\n*Which commands to you allow via sudo \n\n*You need to write sudo before every command requiring administrative privilege \n\n*Every so often you need to re-type the password.\n\n\nWhat does sudo mean? Its name is a concatenation of \"su\" (substitute user) and \"do\".\nWhy sudo not admin? I think sudo means admin for a specific time and only when you need it. \nPeople who are coming from windows environment should understand why it is not admin :) \nReferences : Site\nPicture : xkcd\n\nA: From the Sudo website :\n\"What is Sudo?\nSudo (su \"do\") allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.\"\n\"Sudo was first conceived and implemented by Bob Coggeshall and Cliff Spencer around 1980 at the Department of Computer Science at SUNY/Buffalo. It ran on a VAX-11/750 running 4.1BSD. An updated version, credited to Phil Betchel, Cliff Spencer, Gretchen Phillips, John LoVerso and Don Gworek, was posted to the net.sources Usenet newsgroup in December of 1985.\" \nThat said, while I don't believe there is any proof, I have always strongly believed that the name was a kind of geeky programmer joke. You have the command \"su\" (super user) \"do\" but you aren't actually a super user -- turn the \"doo\" into a \"doh\" and \"sudo\" looks/sounds a lot like \"pseudo\" (fake, sham).\n\nA: From Linux.com, a product of the Linux Foundation:\n\nSudo stands for either \"substitute user do\" or \"super user do\" (depending upon how you want to look at it). What sudo does is incredibly important and crucial to many Linux distributions. Effectively, sudo allows a user to run a program as another user (most often the root user).\n\n[Emphasis mine.]\nSource\n\nA: Most folks have given the answer that it's a mashup of \"super user do\". I like this, but it may be more correct to say that it's a mashup of \"substitute user do\" because you can choose what user you \"do\" as with the -u flag.\nI also think of it as a play on the word psuedonym because you can pretend to be someone else , either root or any other user using the -u flag.\n", "Q: When I create a folder in ~/ starting with a period, where is is located?

Unfortunately that is a bit beyond the scope of my knowledge.\nI am willing to invest the time to get this working as a hobby project, but would like to ensure that my time would not be wasted. \nSo my question for any gurus out there is: Is it possible to load an on-screen keyboard with touchscreen support to enter the passkey for an encrypted drive?\nedit:If it matters it is currently built as Ubuntu desktop using the alternate 12.04.4 installer.\n\nA: A very nice on-screen keyboard ships with Ubuntu.  (If it is not included with the alternate installer, install it using  sudo apt-get install onboard).  The keyboard can be invoked by searching for and running Onboard from the Dash; it can be configured by launching Onboard Settings from the Dash.\nThe danger with an on-screen keyboard and touch (only) screen is that the user could potentially close the keyboard at the Lock-Screen or the Login-Screen, and would have no way to bring it back up.  (After having logged in, however, the user could easily tap on the Ubuntu Dash, and restart the keyboard, if necessary).\nI wrote a script to address this and other issues with a touch-screen only keyboard system.

Depending on your computer model, this key may be different.  (Usually it is the Del key, the F12 key, the ESC key, etc.\nYou can search online to learn how to access the BIOS of your computer and how to set the CD drive as the first boot drive.\nMake sure your Ubuntu 14.04 Live CD is in the drive, and you will be able to install Ubuntu from it.\n", "Q: How to install sublime text on ubuntu chromebook?

Most people i know usually install Windows first, then put Ubuntu second.That way Ubuntu can take over the grub and Include Windows. So Yes you really can and I'd recommend you do it that way.  Good Luck.\n\nA: When there is a preinstalled windows I believe that most laptops have only one partition.\nBUT\nyou can use disk management utility in Windows 7 (Create and Format Disk Partitions) to cut some space from any partition (it depends on where the last data is lacated). You can select your partition and choose \"Shrink volume\" to free a space for another partition.\nThen you can reboot with your Ubuntu CD/DVD, format that unpartitioned space you got and install Ubuntu there.\n\nA: You can dual boot the laptop, certainly, there are plenty of instructions out there:\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5403100/dual-boot-windows-7-and-ubuntu-in-perfect-harmony\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=dual+boot+linux+windows&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t\nBut I might offer you another alternative, which I use.

I read this post that proposes a solution to delete the first column (see Peter's answer). However, it doesn't work for me as the numbers have different sizes and I cannot repeat the operation to delete the first column. How can I do then? \n\nA: This should delete all chars before and including the 1st tab on any line: \n:%s/^[^\\t]*\\t//\nCommand line cut:\ncut -f 2- {filename.txt} > {filenamenew.txt}\n\ncut defaults to tabs; if you want something else like a space add -d \" \". \n-f is fields to copy over. 2- means all from (and including) column 2. \n\nA: Through awk,\nawk -F\"\\t\" '{print FS,$2}' file > newfile\n\nIt cuts the first column and prints only the remaining tab and  second column.\nThrough sed,\nsed -r 's/^([^\\t]*)\\t(.*)$/\\t\\2/g' file > newfile\n\n\nA: :%s/[^\\t]*\\t//\nOn every line (%), replace (s/ORIGINAL/REPLACEMENT/) the first occurrence of “non-tab characters ([^\\t], in any number (*)) followed by a tab \\t” by nothing. You can type Tab instead of \\t.\nAlternatively you can match the shortest sequence of characters (.\\{-}) ending in a tab. .*\\t would match the longest match for .*, so it would match all but the last column; .\\{-} matches the shortest match which is the first column.\n:%s/.\\{-}\\t//\n\nA: In Vi to remove first column (separated by space), you can do:\n:%norm dW\n\nfor a column separated by Tab, it's:\n:%norm dfCtrl+VTab\nSo the command which would remove the first column from file (in-place) can be:\nex +\"%norm df$(echo -e '\\t')\" -scwq file\n\nTo check the output before saving (dry-run), replace -scwq with -sc'%p|q!'.\nOr based on Chris suggestion, like:\nex -c':exe \":%norm df\\<Tab>\"' -sc'%p|q!' <(echo -e \"a a\\tb b\\tc c\")\n\n\nAlternatively do it in visual mode (if starting from the top-left):\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter visual-block by Ctrl+v.\n\n*Jump at the end and select first column by pressing: G, E (or adjust manually).\n\n*Press d to delete the selected block.\n\n\nA: To remove the remaining space before the second column I suggest:\n:%norm dfCtrl+VTabx\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu on windows 7 using ISO with no disk?

You can always configure your router to use a static address for your server's MAC address, having the same effect and saving you from the hassle of having to configure your network manually.\n", "Q: Is there an kernel version list available somewhere? So, for dev needs, I need to find all available kernel versions for given ubuntu version, for example, Lucid Lynx server. \nIn short, something similar to this novell wiki for SLES:\nhttp://wiki.novell.com/index.php/Kernel_versions\nSo, is there something like this, but for ubuntu? \nMy google searches found absolutely nothing. :(\n\nA: I think the question itself is somewhat invalid, since you can compile any custom Linux kernel and use it with Ubuntu. For example, I'm renting a VPS running Saucy (13.10), which comes with the 3.11.x kernel by default, but my provider is using 2.6.32 so it's actually running on 2.6.32.\nAnyway, Wikipedia has a list of the default kernels shipped with each version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you are looking for the mainline kernel mapping and also get the branch using git\n", "Q: How to get more info while installing an application?

There seems to be no information regarding this on man page of apt-get.\n\nA: You can use\napt show <package_name>\n\nto get the information regarding a package, including packages that this package depends on and also its description.\nFor example, do\napt show geany\n\nto get information regarding geany\nFor more information, refer to the manual page of apt.\n\nA: I've been using apt-cache show <package> for 7 years or so, but here might be more sophisticated methods out there ever since, for example, you could try aptitude.\n", "Q: How Do I upgrade Docker I type docker.io version, and get:\nClient version: 0.9.1\nGo version (client): go1.2.1\nGit commit (client): 3600720\nServer version: 0.9.1\nGit commit (server): 3600720\nGo version (server): go1.2.1\nLast stable version: 0.11.1, please update docker\n\nI follow that with an apt-get update, then either: apt-get upgrade, or apt-get upgrade docker.io, but all it gives me is:\ndocker.io is already the newest version.\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\n\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) 64bit server.\nEDIT: I think I used a script in this Post comment to install docker (since it purported to allow me to just type docker instead of docker.io)\n\nA: You can install from the third-party repository following the instructions:\n$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 36A1D7869245C8950F966E92D8576A8BA88D21E9\n$ sudo sh -c \"echo deb https://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list\"\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install lxc-docker\n\n\nA: You have the latest version of docker.io (0.9.1) which is available in the ubuntu repositories for Trusty Tahr as of today.\nHowever, if you still want to upgrade the version, you can clone the latest version of docker.io from github and recompile. For instructions regarding installing it from source, there is an interactive tutorial on docker.io's blog.\n\nA: Warning: Since this is an older Post, please use to official resources to prevent issues: https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download\n\nOne way to upgrade to the latest version (without installing from source) is to use the instructions here provided by Digital Ocean:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add docker repository key to apt-key for package verification\nsudo sh -c \"wget -qO- https://get.docker.io/gpg | apt-key add -\"\n\n*Add the docker repository to aptitude sources:\nsudo sh -c \"echo deb http://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main\\ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list\"\n\n*Update the repository with the new addition:\nsudo aptitude update\n\n*Finally, download and install docker:\nsudo aptitude install lxc-docker\n\nA: Suppose it is Ubuntu Trusty (14.04) release, which has 0.9.1 officially\nUpdate again in 2017/03/07 to reflect to the changes in new release, see https://blog.docker.com/2017/03/docker-enterprise-edition/ \nOfficial guideline is here Install docker for Ubuntu, old release had different package name.\n\n\n*\n\n*docker.io: is used to be very old version in default ubuntu repo (can skip here)\n\n*docker-engine: is used before release 1.13.x\n\n*docker-ce: since 17.03\n\n\nfor docker-engine\n# add the new gpg key\n$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D\n# add new repo\n$ sudo add-apt-repository \\\n  \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n  $(lsb_release -cs) \\\n  stable\"\n\nThen you can smoothly upgrade to latest docker version\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\n# remove the old\n$ sudo apt-get purge lxc-docker*\n\n# install the new\n$ sudo apt-get install docker-engine\n\nAnd in the case that you don't want to install latest package then you can do something like below.\n$ sudo apt-get install docker-engine=1.7.1-0~trusty\n\nfor docker-ce\n$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\n$ sudo add-apt-repository \\\n  \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n  $(lsb_release -cs) \\\n  stable\"\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce\n\n\nA: Short answer: the official Docker install doc now covers this for Ubuntu 14.04 (though it's not as clear as it could be).\nThe Ubuntu package named docker.io is not maintained by Docker, Inc. and will lag behind the latest version. For example today it's stuck at 0.9.1 and latest is 1.0.1. I would go ahead and remove this if you have it.\nThe Docker package is named lxc-docker (confusingly, since LXC is no longer strictly required). It is however up to date. You will need to add the Docker-owned repo to your apt-get setup. The official Docker install doc covers this for Ubuntu 14.04 - look for \"If you'd like to try the latest version of Docker\". Note, the binary will be docker (as opposed to docker.io when provided by Ubuntu).\n\nA: If you trust get.docker.com, run:\ncurl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sudo bash\n\n\nA: or just simply sudo apt-get install -f docker-ce to get the latest stable\n\nA: You also can download the docker.io 0.11.1 .deb file from Launchpad and install.\nwget https://launchpad.net/~docker-maint/+archive/testing/+files/docker.io_0.11.1%7Edfsg1-1%7Eppa1%7Etrusty1_amd64.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i docker.io_0.11.1~dfsg1-1~ppa1~trusty1_amd64.deb\n\n\nA: I most commonly used to install the latest Docker and docker-compose:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/DrSnowbird/shell-utility/blob/master/docker/installation/docker-ce-install-Ubuntu.sh\n\n*https://github.com/DrSnowbird/shell-utility/blob/master/docker/installation/docker-ce-install-CentOS.sh\n", "Q: Which is the best ubuntu version for my laptop dell inspiron 3521 Following is my laptop configuration\nModel : Dell Inspiron 3521\nProcessor : i3 third Generation\nRam : 4 GB\nHard Disk : 500GB\nGraphics Cards: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 4000 HD, ATI Readon HD 87XX Series.\n\nI tried installing Ubuntu 13.10 , every thing works fine except my hybrid ati graphics card.And when i installed 12.04 LTS nothing was working(wifi,ethernet,sound etc). \nSo please tell me which Ubuntu will be best for my laptop ....\n\nA: Try Ubuntu 14.04  (LTS). \nNvidia graphic card is running fine in Xubuntu 14.04.\nHope 14.04 can solve your problem. \n\nA: You can check this link and see the certified hardware for Ubuntu.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/make/Dell/?category=Desktop&category=Laptop\nI hope this helps.\nRegards,\n", "Q: Can I 'reset' an SSD to improve its performance?

Read and analyze them to get messages such as \"error\" or \"critical\", etc. Usually, the more important (critical) ones are in red such as this:\n\nand analyze as to what caused the crash and resolve it, if possible.\nIf the virtual machine is not pretty important:\nReport and ignore. This message might be just an application crash report, but is essential that the developers know about it (which is why it is encouraged to report and should be done so). You can continue working unless something really bizarre happens(the crash might now be the cause in future) or create a new virtual machine right away.\nHowever, it would be great if you could reproduce the crash and report it as a bug to the developers of the concerned package so that it is resolved upstream and other users (or you) in future are not affected by the same.\n", "Q: Nvidia problem when installing wine I have a system that has optimus Nvidia card, so when i try to install wine it says.\nThe following packages will be REMOVED:\n  nvidia-libopencl1-331-updates\n\nI have tried wine1.6 & wine1.7 same they will remove it nvidia-libopencl1-331-updates and i will not be able to use Optimus.\nIs there any work around to install wine ?\n\none@Ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install wine1.7\nReading package lists...

This will abruptly close the process (job) without giving it the time to exit normally.

Since the problem is only with your new home wireless, I suspect it's a configuration problem in the router. \nFirst, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, I have better luck with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. \nMake sure the router is set to automatic B, G, N  and, if it's capable, AC speeds, not locked to N and certainly not locked to AC since the Intel wireless device you have is not AC capable.\nAfter making these changes, reboot the router.\n\nA: I experienced this issue once. As far as i know, ubuntu can't connect to WPA 2 PSK wifi security. \nTry to change your wireless adapter security setting to WPA PSK. I tried this and it works now.\n\nA: Is the Wireless turned on?

I'm using Gnome Flashback with Ubuntu 14.04. When I plug in my Android 4.4 device by USB, it connects using MTP, and in Nautilus it looks like this:\n\nSo far, so good. In Clementine, it appears under the Devices section, like so:\n\nIf I double click on it, it does this:\n\n... and then it finishes like this:\n\nWhich all seems promising. I do actually have a bunch of songs on there that I had long ago copied over using Banshee, but I won't hold it against Clementine for not seeing them. Maybe it wants it's own special folders or something.\nIn any case, from this point, I can't find any option for syncing any play lists or copying music to my device.

Pleas guide me how to make Partitions after Installation\n\nA: Is it possible that you just want to get more storage for your installation? If this is the case I would recommend you just resizing the current partition of ubuntu.\nEther way here is a short explanation on how to partitioning your disk.\nI personally prefer the gparted tool, which can be downloaded by typing:\napt-get install gparted\n\nin a bash (This needs super user priviliges).\nIn the upper right corner of this tool should be your disk. It should look like the following: \"/dev/sda\" or so. Now you can start partitioning...\nBy selecting one of the partitions in the middle of window and clicking delete you will erase all data on this partition. Be advised to double check if you really want to do that.\nAfter that the deleted part of the disk should be named \"unallocated\". Now right click and select new and choose whatever you want. I would recommend something like ext4 as the file system. After that just click on the check-mark in the toolbar and gparted will do the rest.\n\nA: To install gparted you must enter the following in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nTo do it full automatic (if you don't want the Y/n option) use the following command in a termial.\nsudo apt-get install gparted -y\n\n\nA: If you did a clean install, and used your whole disk for the partition, you really don't need to create another, it just complicates things. If you have a separate drive that has more space or something, then just plug it in with a file manager open and take note of the drive name that appears, rename it to something that you will remember (something other than the default \"XXgb volume\" or \"UUID:XXXXXXXXXXX\"). If you want it to mount at boot to, say, a folder in your home folder, then use your livecd to open gparted (or burn an Ubuntu livecd with dparted installed) and find the drive, right click, click on info, and write down the UUID on a piece of paper. Boot back into your main installation and open terminal, type in sudo kate /etc/fstab .Copy the line that has [uuid] / [bunch of modifiers] and then change the uuid to the one you wrote down, and the / to the path to where you want it to mount, save the document and then reboot, it will act like any other folder, but the contents will be installed to the other disk.\n", "Q: (32) Ad-Hoc mode is not supported by this device. - 13.10 on i5 NUC Not sure if this is an Ubuntu issue or intel issue.

Here is what I've done: \nI have a sh script looking like this\n  #!/bin/sh\n\n  amixer -D pulse sset Master 20%\n\nplaced in /etc/init.d/K99_set_volume.sh and have used \nln -s /etc/init.d/K99_set_volume.sh /etc/rc0.d/K99_set_volume.sh\nln -s /etc/init.d/K99_set_volume.sh /etc/rc6.d/K99_set_volume.sh\n\nto make the right links. Unfortunately, the volume at boot is the same level as the previous session. I tried to explicitly insert a line with \"alsactl store\" into the script after reducing the volume, but to no effect. The script is executable and works when run in a terminal and the volume is indeed set in /var/lib/alsa/asound.state. Also, the script runs at shut down, I checked that. I don't know if the number 99 is right, though.\nI know there are some posts on that topic, but I would really like to find a solution with a script at shut down/boot and the posts I've read suggest to do pretty much what I do?\nThe full output from pacmd list-sinks is\n 2 sink(s) available.  \n    index: 0    \n    name: alsa_output.pci-0000_00_03.0.hdmi-stereo   \n    driver: module-alsa-card.c  \n    flags: HARDWARE DECIBEL_VOLUME LATENCY DYNAMIC_LATENCY  \n    state: SUSPENDED  \n    suspend cause: IDLE  \n    priority: 9950  \n    volume: 0:  20% 1:  20%  \n            0: -41,94 dB 1: -41,94 dB  \n            balance 0,00  \n    base volume: 100%  \n                 0,00 dB  \n    volume steps: 65537  \n    muted: yes  \n    current latency: 0,00 ms  \n    max request: 0 KiB  \n    max rewind: 0 KiB  \n    monitor source: 0  \n    sample spec: s16le 2ch 44100Hz  \n    channel map: front-left,front-right  \n                 Stereo  \n    used by: 0  \n    linked by: 0  \n    configured latency: 0,00 ms;

If you really like to modify the volume, I recommend you to instead use pactl:\npactl set-sink-volume 0 20%\n\nand do it only at boot time. I would prefer that you waits until pulseaudio is started. For that is better using upstart, since it's an event based init. For this, just create the setvolume.conf file in the /etc/init directory, and fill it with the following content:\nstart on started pulseaudio\n\nsetgid username\nsetuid username\n\nscript\n    exec pactl set-sink-volume 0 20%\nend script\n\nThis will assure you that after pulseaudio starts it will be with the desired volume for your user.\n\nA: After experimenting for several hours, reading many notes I found a part of the solution on this website.

Prior to upgrading to 14.04 I was using bumblebee in order to utilize my nvidia gpu (Nvidia GeForce 740M). In 14.04 I read somewhere that it was better to use prime and switch easily between the two graphic cards at any time.\nSo I tried installing nvidia 331, 337 and all other versions between 331 and 337 that automatically came with prime installed, but I encountered the following problem:\nOnce the nvidia driver is installed, the laptop starts using the nvidia card exclusively and when I switch back to my Intel card I can no longer open nvidia settings and I can no longer switch back to my nvidia card. This is what I get when I try to launch nvidia settings from the terminal: \n** Message: PRIME: Requires offloading\n** Message: PRIME: is it supported? yes\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nI tried everything (installed prime indicator, tried with different version of nvidia driver), but to no avail. Any help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you.\n\nA: I have been able to find a solution (using the terminal to move between graphic cards, having a GeForce 840M and Ubuntu 14.04).\nFirst of all, I had broken many things in the system, so I decided to reinstall Ubuntu 14.04 again (some things were not fixed after removing nvidia packages... so I decided to start from scratch). After having Ubuntu 14.04 completely new, I have added the following repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nThen I did the classical apt-get update and apt-get upgrade, and after that, I installed only these 2 packages:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-common\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331\n\nThe driver for my 840M GPU should be the 337, but I read that probably 331 works in a better way.\nSo I rebooted and everything seemed to be right. Then, by running \nprime-select query\n\nI saw that it was using nvidia. And nvidia-settings opened correctly. Then I chose from the nvidia-settings to move to Intel. I logged out and when I came back, I was working with intel (check it with prime-select query).\nAnd at this point, nvidia-settings stops working and is not able to open. But if I run in a terminal\nsudo prime-select nvidia\n\nand then I log out, the new session start under nvidia GPU and nvidia-settings is able to open again.\nIn conclusion, after doing that, now I move from one GPU to the other by typing \nsudo prime-select nvidia\n\nor\nsudo prime-select intel\n\nand logging out after it. And the nvidia-settings only opens when I'm working under the nvidia GPU.\nI hope this will be useful for you... I've tried 331 drivers before, but it had't work. I think for me the important point was to reinstall Ubuntu and to install 331 drivers at the begining.\nIn addition, I have to say that the first time I move from the Intel to Nvidia, X crashed and asked me about reconfiguring it. I said ok, I rebooted and from that point now I move from intel to nvidia (using the terminal) without problems, but probably you won't have this X crash...\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Deleted Xubuntu Partition, Windows Will now not boot I deleted the Xubuntu partition, hoping it would just delete Xubuntu and everything would be fine.

And things are running nicely here, except that the computer is running significantly warmer than when I ran windows 7.\nI can't remember what processor / graphics card I have, and am not sure how to check this on lubuntu (any help here?) But a standard hp mini 210 has a 1.666Hz intel atom processor N450 and an Intel GMA 3150 graphics card. \nAny ideas of how I can make my computer less hot?\n\nA: There are a few important things to factor in here. \nFirst, Linux is going to use your hardware differently. That means the temperature will be different. It may do more stuff, use more power, have different default CPU speeds etc. \nThis is not a bad thing, it is just 'a' thing. \nSecond, Linux will not overheat your board. The kernel has built in protection. If your box gets to hot it will log a \"Thermal Event\" and then either shut down or adjust things to run cooler. \nThird,  almost all boards have a thermal protection circuit that will turn off the computer  before any damage is done. You should not relay on this, as it is just a safety net but it's worth mentioning. \nLast, Linux is very adjustable if you have a real need to run cooler (and it's not just to match windows) you can probably slow the CPU, speed up any fans, turn off some graphic features, or kill some CPU intensive processes. (Or maybe even run some hardware in a \"power saver\" mode that reduces the power it uses.)\nMy advise is, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Look in /var/log/messages and see if there are any thermal events, if there aren't and the computer is not crashing, then your fine and enjoy your new Linux box.\n\nA: I came across this post and recently found a possible solution.\nA little back story... \nMy HP mini 210 I bought used at my local Goodwill Store for less than $50.

By googling I just get the inversion of colors as suggestion – which is sometimes even worse for the eyes.\nIs there a pdf reader allowing me to change background color (without changing the color of the text)?\nEdit: The first comment below suggests it depends on the file. Therefore I added to the title arXiv's. \n\nA: You can do this in Okular if you don't mind pulling in kde dependencies.\nsudo apt-get install okular\n\nThe option is found in Settings/Configure Okular.../Accessibility by checking Change colors then Color mode: Change Paper Color and select a color in the swatch below. Works with several pdf files I have from arxiv, but perhaps unsurprisingly, doesn't work with pdf files that are simply scans of pages.\n\nA: There is another possibility. Install zathura. It is a lightweight PDF, DJVU and PS reader. It is highly configurable and of course it allows changing the color of the background and the text. Just add these lines to ~/.config/zathura/zathurarc:\nset recolor true\nset recolor-darkcolor \"#dcdccc\"\nset recolor-lightcolor \"#1f1f1f\"\n\nThe above color variables will give you this:\n\nI also recommend you to set these options:\nset window-title-basename \"true\"\nset selection-clipboard \"clipboard\"\n\nFor help go to the Arch forums.\nLook here for mouse and key bindings.\nDisclaimer: I am in no way related to the development of zathura. I am just a happy user.\n\nA: You can use the cross-platform Master PDF Editor, which is closer in functionality to Adobe Acrobat than to a mere PDF reader.\nIn Tools > Settings > Display activate Replace Document Colors and choose the colors that you want to use. Click Ok. \nOpen a PDF file and in the View menu select Replace Document Colors.\n\nA: xpdf was the first to do this, I think. I discovered this option in it several years ago.\nYou can read about it in the man page, but I just made an alias, since I usually open PDF files from the terminal (which I basically never close while I am doing anything in my computer).\nThe alias is:\nalias xpdf='xpdf -cont -papercolor \"#aab\"'\n\n\nA: Emacs!\nInstall pdf-tools from melpa and enable pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode in pdf-view-mode. The default color for midnight mode is light grey on dark blue but this can be changed by configuring pdf-view-midnight-colors, eg.\n(setq pdf-view-midnight-colors '(\"#000000\" . \"#dcdcdc\"))\n\nPS: It works on scanned copies too.\n\nA: \nAs shown in the image it is possible with the default PDF viewer \"Document Viewer\". just select that setting option and there is inverted colours mode which pretty much does the job. \n\nA: With most of the tools already mentioned under this question, only pdf files made out of text files (and not of scanned/photocopied text saved as image) can be treated so that colors of page and fonts (or at least of page, as expected by the OP) are changed. In case the available text is a pdf formed of images (e.g. paper that was scanned) the pages will in many cases show paper-like black-on-white text (even if images are extracted and converted to an ebook format as said here). There, the only possible color change of image-based pdf-s is inverting colors with viewers that have that option: Evince,  Qoppa-PDFStudioViewer), xpdf (with the -rv argument, see here), mupdf (here).\nThere are exceptions, though, viewers that can do more than just inverting colors or changing only the background:\nFor all pdf (including image-based) files\n(image-based = e.g. a book or article scanned/photocopied and saved as pdf)\n\n*\n\n*Okular:\n\nIn newer versions of Okular (like 1.9.3) both font and page colors can be edited — and a dark-mode look can be enabled — through a new and rather non-intuitive setting, under Configure Okular - Accessibility - Color mode: Change Dark and Light Colors, by selecting a light color for dark and a dark one for light color option.\n\nThen, for easy access, configure toolbar and add Toggle change color. It works for picture/scanned pages too.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Zathura - with settings like those mentioned in this older answer\nand\n\n*\n\n*Master PDF Editor\ncan change color of both pages and fonts even in image-based pdf files.\n\n\nSelect \"more\" to have any color:\n\nWith an image/scanned text, a value of#3b3537 for the page color and #b0afac for the font color gives this:\n\nThus, a scanned pdf text can be read with different color profiles, just like an epub can in an ebook reader.\nFor text-based pdf files\n(text-based= e.g. text files saved/exported/printed as pdf)\n(A)\nPDF readers, beside Master PDF Editor and Zathura:\n\n*\n\n*Adobe Reader 9:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Foxit Reader for Linux has the option of changing both the color of background and of text — either by selecting a color profile\n\n\nor by selecting any color\n\nBut there are some limitations of Foxit Reader for the moment (version 2.4.4): it has no dark GUI (while not following a dark desktop theme) and no full-screen.\nHaving a large white area on the screen all the time comes against the purpose of improving readability, so I prefer other solutions.\n(B)\nE-book readers\nMost eBook readers offer color settings for page and font, but only some of them can open pdf documents. As far as I can tell they do not display the text as well as a pdf viewer in all cases. I have tested only two:\n\n*\n\n*Bookworm - it has 3 color profiles but each profile can be edited (fully adjustable colors for background and fonts under Preferences). Poor pdf text rendering in the document tested by me - sometimes lacking spaces between words and wrong display of non-English accented characters.\n\n\n*Calibre's Ebook Viewer - better rendering of pdf text (very few problems with the same document tested in Bookworm). Color settings are accessed by opening a book, right-clicking, then selecting Preferences - Colors.\nThe quality of pdf display in an ebook reader may depend on the pdf too. I have noticed that, when trying to open a pdf, ebook readers run pdftohtml tool.\n\nA: The given answer based on okular is perfect.\nAnother option is to configure Acrobat Reader to do that. \nGo to \nEdit > Preferences > Accessibility > Replace Document Colors > Check box in Custom Colors\n\nthen choose your colors; the new preferences are loaded automatically next time you open the same kind of pdf's (LaTeX generated?).\n\nA: You can use arxiv.black\nReplace '.org' with '.black' on the Arxiv.org PDF and enjoy dark mode.\nThis is how it looks like\n\n", "Q: External Hard Drive erased and possibly corrupted after partition change on gparted I have a WD Elements external hard drive and I used it on my Windows to install Ubuntu 14.04. I then used gparted to bring back Windows and run a dual-boot, so I changed the external hard drive's format from Fat32 to ntfs. It did not result in any loss whatsoever.

If I cannot do it manually, will a data engineer be able to do the same? Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Format is the action of either wiping a drive(quick method) or removing the partition table altogether to place another partition table on the drive specified.  The data you seek to recover is fragmented and will not be recoverable at the point your asking.  Also, the Disk is not corrupted.  However, if the disk did have errors that were non-recoverable using a disk repair tool, then the chances of further damage to any drive is greatly increased due to what is done on the drive its self.\nI do recommended next time you back up your data before switching Operating System or even dual booting a second OS to prevent little mistakes like this one.\n", "Q: How to discover what file in the dev/ directory is related to the SD card reader of my laptop? how can I discover what file inside dev/ directory is related to my SD card reader of my laptop?\nI thought that I could execute the following operations:\n1) Remove the SD card from the reader\n2) Insert it again into the reader\n3) Open the dmesg log and search in the lasts records\nBut this is not possible for me because my Ubuntu is installed on a virtual machine and when I remove and put it again the SD card the system crash\nWhat can I do to discover it?\nEDIT 1: executing sudo fdisk -l I obtain this output\nDisco /dev/sdb: 7948 MB, 7948206080 byte\n255 testine, 63 settori/tracce, 966 cilindri, totale 15523840 settori\nUnità = settori di 1 * 512 = 512 byte\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nIdentificativo disco: 0x00000000\n\nDispositivo Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1            8192    15518789     7755299    b  W95 FAT32\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 42.9 GB, 42949672960 bytes\n255 testine, 63 settori/tracce, 5221 cilindri, totale 83886080 settori\nUnità = settori di 1 * 512 = 512 byte\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nIdentificativo disco: 0x000ba73e\n\nDispositivo Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048    77080575    38539264   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2        77082622    83884031     3400705    5  Esteso\n/dev/sda5        77082624    83884031     3400704   82  Linux swap / Solaris\nandrea@andrea-virtual-machine:~$ \n\nTnx\nAndrea\n\nA: I would recommend:\nsudo fdisk -l\n", "Q: How do I load Ubuntu using Netboot?

I have a tower that was running Windows XP from a friend, and want to load Ubuntu onto it. \nThe boot options are Network Boot, Floppy, CD-ROM, Hard Drive. No USB option.

I've set up ites on Centos but Apache on Ubuntu is so different. Running Ubuntu 14 on AWS. I want to setup joomla but I can't even get the default index.html that is included with apache2 to open! I am only going to have one website on this server. I installed all LAMP components via sudo apt-get install lamp-server^. Can someone tell me what if anything I need to do with apache2.conf, the file in sites-available and or the config file in sites-enabled?\nI would have though that after the initial install of LAMP if I just entered the public address of my EC2 instance/index.html the default page would come up, but instead I get nothing.\nAny help would be appreciated. I need to at least get the default index.html loading before I bother installing joomla.\nI assume its something really simple that I am missing here.\nThanks\n\nA: Assuming that the lamp-server package installed correctly, everything should \"Just work\" and you should see the default Debian/Ubuntu apache page. On Ubuntu 14.04, the default DocumentRoot is set to /var/www/html. The file /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default is the default virtualhost controlling that. (It's sym-linked to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default - any file in the sites-enabled directory is the actual virtualhost that's created).\n(I'm not sure if the lamp-server package does any extra/odd configuration form installing all those packages manually - read here to see the packages it installs).\nAre your firewalls open to accept traffic from port 80? (This is usually related to AWS's security settings when you start up a server).\nLastly, I'll mention that I've gotten into the habit of installing the usual packages instead of the \"catch all\" lamp-server package. Here's an example of that on 12.04 (the same commands will work for 14.04). If you want to see examples of various installs in Ubuntu 14.04, check out my Vaprobash project, which has a ton of bash scripts you can copy/paste from to run commands for installing LAMP/LEMP stacks. (Warning: It uses php5-fpm over apache's usual libapache2-php5 package.

Left click on a launcher opens the right click menu My launcher consists of a few icons, with about 5 applications in the right click menu of each icon.  If possible, I'd like to change the behavior of clicking on these icons.  \nInstead of right clicking to get the menu, I'd like to left click, and get the menu that you normally get by right clicking the icon.  \n\nA: With a little creativity\nYou can make a left click on the launcher icon behave as a right click.\nYou mention you have five applications availbale on right-click. I assume you created or edited the quicklists (desktop files) yourself, and added the application shortcuts. I also assume you do not need or use its native command anymore, since it would result in a strange behaviour of the launcher; launching one application and at the same time offering a menu to choose another...\nThe solution I suggest uses the desktop file's native command to simulate right clicking on the icon. \nThe solution \nThe solution is icon specific, so not the general behaviour of the Unity Launcher will change, only of the icon of which you prepared the .desktop file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xdotool, (it is in the repositories) with which you can simulate keyboard and mouse actions. \n\n*Then replace the desktop file's (first) Exec= line by:\nExec=xdotool click 3\n\nThen, when you click on the icon in the launcher with left click, it behaves as right-click and shows you the quicklist items you created in the .desktop file.\nCosmetic difference with a \"real\" right-click\nUsually, when you start an application by (left) clicking on its launcher, it is blinking for a few seconds, as a \"time out\" for the icon before you can reuse it. Although you can use items from the menu immediately, before you can reuse it, the icon has a time out of a few seconds just like it would have when starting an application from its native command. That would be a bit annoying if you would like to quickly start more than one application from the icon's shortcuts.\nTo limit the visual effect of the time out, you can set the desktop's StartupNotify=true to StartupNotify=false, so the \"turning wheel\" will not appear.\n", "Q: Can't Log In To Steam UBUNTU 14.04 LTS When you start steam message \"Steam is having trouble connecting to the Steam servers.\"\njakub@PC:~$ steam\nRunning Steam on ubuntu 14.04 64-bit\nSTEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1400690891_client)\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1400690891_client)\nGtk-Message: Failed to load module \"overlay-scrollbar\"\nGtk-Message: Failed to load module \"unity-gtk-module\"\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1400690891_client)\nFontconfig error: \"/etc/fonts/conf.d/10-scale-bitmap-fonts.conf\", line 70: non-double matrix element\nFontconfig error: \"/etc/fonts/conf.d/10-scale-bitmap-fonts.conf\", line 70: non-double matrix element\nFontconfig warning: \"/etc/fonts/conf.d/10-scale-bitmap-fonts.conf\", line 78: saw unknown, expected number\n[0526/004126:WARNING:proxy_service.cc(958)] PAC support disabled because there is no system implementation\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1400690891_client)\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1400690891_client)\n[HTTP Remote Control] HTTP server listening on port 34547.\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1400690891_client)\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1400690891_client)\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1400690891_client)\nGenerating new string page texture 7: 128x256, total string texture memory is 131,07 KB\nGenerating new string page texture 8: 64x256, total string texture memory is 196,61 KB\nGenerating new string page texture 9: 48x256, total string texture memory is 245,76 KB\nGenerating new string page texture 10: 256x256, total string texture memory is 507,90 KB\nGenerating new string page texture 11: 16x256, total string texture memory is 524,29 KB\nGenerating new string page texture 12: 24x256, total string texture memory is 548,86 KB\nGenerating new string page texture 13: 32x256, total string texture memory is 581,63 KB\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1400690891_client)\n\nHow to fix it?\n\nA: I have the same problem on Ubuntu 14.04 32 bits using the NVIDIA properietary drivers (331.38 on a Dell XPS L501x).\nWell similar, I don't even see a window.

If its the OS, what distro of Linux should I get for my computer then? \n\nA: It's probably the operating system that's the problem, try installing an older version of Ubuntu and see if that works.  I also have a mid 2010 Mac Mini that's currently running OS X Mavericks, and I've been attempting to install Ubuntu through various methods (LiveCD method, bootable USB, and dual booting) and they all never work.  What would happen is that I would get Ubuntu to load at start up but then it would take a long time to actually load into the operating system, I also have this unusual issue with my monitor that isn't present in OS X (Or Windows for that matter) where Ubuntu seems to lag and the screen flashes (This happened the first time on dual booting).  In my opinion, if you want to try out a Linux distribution, do so on a PC, Macs are very close sourced as far as hardware and software goes, so even if you got it to work, you probably wouldn't have a lot of options.

My advise would be to reinstall OS X and leave it at that, and if you really want to try out Linux, call Apple to see what they say because as far as operating systems go, Mac really wasn't meant for anything but OS X. \n", "Q: Can't Install Nessus in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I tried with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install nessus\n\nBut It shows:\nReading package lists...

On windows 8 my CPU temp is roughtly 26 degrees when idle. Now when I boot into Ubuntu, CPU temperature is suddenly 43 degrees when idle, plus my fans are making a lot of noise which is probably because of the CPU degrees.\nWhy is that? Everywhere I read it says the Linux is much better at managing CPU and so on. But yet it seems something is wrong. \nIt is a stock installation of Ubuntu 14.04 and my CPU is a Intel i5-4570\n\nA: Ubuntu come configured to use the CPU in its limit when it is needed. You can configure your computer to use less processing power than it is available and things will cool down.\nOpen a terminal and type:\nsudo nano /etc/rc.local\n\nadd this lines before the exit(0)\nfor i in `ls /sys/bus/cpu/devices/ | egrep \"^cpu[0-9]+\"`; do echo \"2000000\" > /sys/bus/cpu/devices/$i/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq; done\nsysctl -w vm.swappiness=0\nexit(0)\n\nand then reboot your computer or execute this command:\nsudo /etc/rc.local\n\nThis will make your computer a little slower, a lot colder and your battery time will increase. \nTweak a bit with the frequency. You can see the valid frequencies with this command:\ncat /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies\n\nOn my i5-3230M valid values are: 2601000 2600000 2500000 2400000 2300000 2200000 2100000 2000000 1900000 1800000 1700000 1600000 1500000 1400000 1300000 1200000. But you should have more high frequencies available.\nMost of the time I limit to the minumum frequency (12000000) and still have a very good desktop experience on ubuntu gnome.

I am unable to continue my work because I cannot put the tables from calc into my writer.\n\nA: This also affects me, but I have a workaround. It only crashes when cells containing formulas are copied/pasted, so you can copy and paste values the cells of interest to another location in calc (i.e. Edit:\"paste special\" and uncheck \"paste all\" and \"formulas\" and check \"Numbers\"). Then the table can be copied and pasted into writer.\n\nA: This might be about to be fixed now.

I left the live usb plugged in and someone reinstalled Ubuntu over that partition.\nI read all I could on the net about people with similar issues. First of all, I stopped using the affected hard drive (writing this from a Lubuntu live cd). Then I ran Photorec on the affected disk, without any filter (i.e. recover everything). The results are now sitting in an external disk.\nAmong all the files, I think it's the .eCryptfs ones I need. However, I only know my login password. I never wrote down the mount passphrase. I know I can recover it with just my login password if I find the wrapped-passphrase file.\nHowever, Photorec didn't recover the original name of any file (I believe it names them according to the disk sector from which they were recovered). Moreover, all files are distributed among different directories (recup_dir.1 and so on).\nIs my only choice to wade through the millions of txt files until I find wrapped-passphrase? I don't think I could recognize it, since most surely it's a byte stream and there might be millions of files like that...\nEDIT: Just in case anyone was wondering, the version was 12.04 (which means the filenames were encrypted, IIRC)\nEDIT2: I created an Ubuntu 12.04 virtual machine with the same user and password as my old system and enabled home dir encryption.

The MBR code connects to the partition with the menu. So, you don't just do grub-install to a partition, but also to a disk.\nNow, I'm not up on the EFI part, as I don't run Windows at all, and it has not been an issue for me.  Plus, I'm relying on how I did things a while back, but I hope I'm remembering correctly.  Hopefully, this will help explain things enough to at least let you ask more specific questions.\nI think what you may need to do is to install the GRUB bootloader into the MBR of both drives, and choose which drive to boot from your BIOS.  One will bring up the menu to choose between Ubuntu and Windows, and the other will boot into Kali.  If you remove one drive, the other will still boot.\nThe way I used to set it up is to boot from a liveCD, like the install CD for Ubuntu.  The disks you want to modify will need to be mounted, either automatically or by you.  If you use the automatic mounting, it will probably mount in /media/UUID of disk.  Then, you issue a command such as this (assumes the target disk is sda, but you'll have to determine which it is.\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/(UUID or directory name) /dev/sda\nYou are specifying the root directory where the grub menu is, (/boot/grub).  It should have the menu already from previous installation.  Once you can boot, you could run update-grub to regenerate the menu and allow all available operating systems to be accessed, if both disks are present.\nI didn't go into a lot of detail for two reasons:  1, I don't know if you need it, and 2, I'm not positive my memory is 100% correct, so if this is what you want to do, either I or someone else can confirm that it will work.\n\nA: Boot-Repair is one of the easier ways to install or repair install of grub2's boot loader (or Windows) to MBR.

So I was wondering if installing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS would solve the problem, at least reduce the overheating and boost the performance?\nShe asked me if I could install linux on her laptop, as I suggested that linux should run better than windows. \nSo, would Ubuntu 14.04 be a good choice or should I go with some more lightweight Linux, given the fact that system components are not quite well?\n\nA: My laptop has very (very) similar system requirements. Same hard drive, same RAM, and almost the same processor, and it runs Ubuntu very well. It sounds like that laptop would run Ubuntu 14.04 perfectly, just as mine does.\n\nA: I suggest installing lubuntu even though you have plenty of ram, lubuntu will use a lot less resources and run cooler.\nI recommend you clean out your laptop and use a chilling pad to help cool your laptop down.\n", "Q: How to get access to Search Results tab in Privacy Settings?

Is there any way to keep the settings of XTerm that I've applied so that it opens with these settings when I reopen it (e.g. text size, set by Ctrl+RightClick)?\n\nA: You can either launch xterm with the relevant option (see man xterm) or create an ~/.Xresource file with the setting there. Try running this command:\necho \"xterm*font: *-fixed-*-*-*-12-*\" >> ~/.Xresources\n\nThat will append xterm*font: *-fixed-*-*-*-12-* to your ~/.Xresources file (creating it if it doesn't exist), which is read by xterm when it starts. If you now log out and log in again, (or just run xrdb -merge .Xresources) your xterm will have its font size set to 12. For the various other options you might want to set, see man xterm and add them to the ~/.Xresources file.\n\nNOTE: This works as expected on my Debian and I used this approach for many years and on many distributions to set the various settings for xterm (and aterm which you might want to check out by the way). For some reason, I can't get it to work on my Ubuntu virtual machine but I am hoping that this is specific to my setup. I'd be very surprised if it doesn't work on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Update\nIt is worth noting that you should, if unsure of what the settings are supposed to look like, to do this:\nxrdb -query\nwhich can give a listing like this (MANY lines not included):\n...\nxterm*background:       black\nxterm*foreground:       #808080\nxterm.SimpleMenu*background:    #6a6a6a      <---- these were\nxterm.SimpleMenu*foreground:    #bfbfbf      <---- the \"correct\" entries!\nxterm.background:       black\nxterm.bg:       black\nxterm.fg:       white\nxterm.foreground:       white\n...\n\nNow in my particular situation, I was setting things up to have white text on black background. I even used other 'tutorials' and guides. It seems that the resource names can vary slightly from distribution to distribution as you see above. \nYour correct entries may not be the same as mine, so if you  are having trouble, query the database and look for the entry that describes your current color or just play with each entry till you find the right one, hopefully there will only be a small bit if you havent tried anything yet.\nBe warned: some window/display/desktop managers like to copy their current 'color scheme' into the database by force. This can be a pain in the neck. It also means you would have to try to find the script responsible, and disable it.\nFor me, I was running KDE, so my script was:\n/usr/share/kde4/apps/kdisplay/app-defaults/XTerm.ad\n\nBut it could be other places depending on the manager you use, and the version of it as well as the distro it is installed on (headache isn't it?). Best thing to do is look for the app-defaults because that seems to be the 'going name' right now. Also, you will know when you hit pay dirt because the file will have something like this:\n xterm*background: WINDOW_BACKGROUND\n xterm*foreground: WINDOW_FOREGROUND\n\n..which is obviously what you want to get rid of, i believe you can just comment them out with '!' or even move the file to be safe if there is no other content in it.\nHope that helps (others too)\n\nA: In recent ubuntus the font size and other options can be configured in file /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm . I tried files  ~/.Xresources  and ~/.Xdefaults but that didn't work for me for some reason.\nThe format is a bit odd, a decent example can seen on this wiki page or just google for \"xterm font size xresources\"\n", "Q: In Consistent RAM reports \n*\n\n*\"System Monitor\" tells me i am using 1.3GB of 2.9GB at 42.8% \"atop\"\n\n*tells me i am have 174.8M Free \"top\" \n\n*tells me i have 3072772 total, 2894424 used, 178348 free\n\n\n3072772KB   = 2.93042373657227GB  \"top\" total\n3040870.4KB = 2.9GB              \"System Monitor\" total\n**2894424**KB   = 2.76033782958984GB  \"top\" used\n**1363148.8**KB = 1.3BG               \"System Monitor\" used\n174.8M      = 0.170703125GB       \"atop\" free\n0178348KB   = 0.170085906982422GB \"top\" Free\n1531275.2 KB or 1.46GB diffrence between Top Used and System Monitor used\nThat is a lot of RAM not accounted for if i only have 0.17GB of RAM Free\nIs there a problem with one of the programs I should know about? Is the \"root\" user using 1.5 GB of ram? \n\nA: System Monitor doesn't count memory currently assigned to the cache as used, top does.  free lists both figures.  System Monitor is generally more correct since Linux tries to use almost all free memory to cache disk files in the hopes it will do some good, and unused free memory is a waste.  It is freed immediately as needed, so for most purposes, can be considered free.\n\nA: \nThis is just a misunderstanding of terms. Both you and Linux agree\nthat memory taken by applications is \"used\", while memory that isn't\nused for anything is \"free\".\nBut what do you call memory that is both used for something and\navailable for applications?\nYou would call that \"free\", but Linux calls it \"used\".\n\n\nfrom: www.linuxatemyram.com\nSystem Monitor tells the used memory as you would call it, but atop/top tell as Linux calls it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server Configuration -- Harddrive Partitioning Currently Ubuntu Server is telling me that when I'm making a new partition for Ubuntu Server on this NTFS 1TB HD that I currently have installed to the hardware, that the partition must be a minimum of 52% of the hard drive space or ~521GB. I'm almost positive that this will run into other data, as I have quite a bit of stuff on the hard drive currently. \nCan I not make a Ubuntu server partition on that hard drive at like 100GB or something? \nWhy does it require so much?\n\nA: First, you really should not use NTFS for your linux (root) partition, use ext4.\nSecond you can install a server in as few as 5 gb + additional space for data. with modern large hard drives, I suggest 20 gb for root.\nI am not sure why the installer is making such a large root partition, I syggest advanced partitioning.\n", "Q: Updating a package using a .deb? I´m using ubuntu 12.04 LTS (precise/amd64), I have installed virtualbox-4.3, I was forced to install it with a downloaded package (.deb) because I could not download it normally, I used \"Free Download Manager\" to download it because the speed was horrible (50KB/s and stuck everytime), and today I was doing apt-get update/upgrade and have a update for virtualbox.\nFirst, I want to know if I download the virtualbox-4.3_4.3.12-93733~Ubuntu~precise_amd64.deb and use the dpkg -i it will update the package without overwriting my settings (or not).\nSecond, I want to know if is just with me this problem that is so slow the speed (In all computers in my network).\nI found a similar question here: Using dpkg to install upgrade and dist-upgrade packages.\nI think this will solve my problem, I will test and after I will post if it worked.\n\nA: I install from virtualbox site and the update installs without overwriting my files.\nIf there is a major update a message will come up that says you have to remove the old virtualbox before installing the new update then I click to remove virtualbox and install the new updated version and it still keeps my settings and vm's as long as I do not choose to remove the configuration files.\nThe updated file you posted is the same as the one on virtualbox and it is a .deb file just install using software center and you should not have any problems.\n", "Q: Install python packages for specific python version I understand that in Ubuntu 14.04, you have access to both python 2.7.6 and python 3.4.0. When getting python packages through the command line, how do I make sure that I am installing packages meant for python 2.7.6 and not for python 3.4.0?\n\nA: Use apt-file to find out the package name. For example if you want to install the right version of reportlab use:\napt-file -l search reportlab\n\nOn my system this produces:\ngambas3-gb-report\npython-mvpa2\npython-pdfrw\npython-pisa\npython-renderpm\npython-renderpm-dbg\npython-reportlab\npython-reportlab-accel\npython-reportlab-accel-dbg\npython-reportlab-doc\npython3-renderpm\npython3-renderpm-dbg\npython3-reportlab\npython3-reportlab-accel\npython3-reportlab-accel-dbg\n\nIt is fair to assume that package python-reportlab is the 2.7 version and package python3-reportlab is the python 3.x version. If however you want to check that further you can use dpkg -L python-reportlab — this will list the package contents and you will see that the files are in /usr/lib/python2.7. \nUnfortunately the dpkg -L works only on installed packages so if you want to check it before you install the package you will have to use the Ubuntu packages web interface.

I love Unity, but would like to use Unity2d because it doesn't run compiz. How do I do this?\n\nA: Unity 2D was abandoned and removed from the repositories in the 12.10 release cycle to focus all development resources on the compiz-based Unity.\nIn the future the current implementation of Unity (compiz-based Unity version 7.2) will be replaced by the converged desktop experience of Unity 8, which we will then still call Unity. To my knowledge this future implementation, which is based upon Qt 5.x will not require compiz.\n\nA: As far as I know, there's no Unity2D on 14.04.

Is it as simple as booting to the new install and mounting the 12.04 VG? I suppose I'd have to manually set up LVM on 14.04 if I want to use the same hostname. \n\nA: Depends on how you organised your old system.\nIf you have a single / filesystem with data and programs mixed in you could:\n - Install the new system on a new logical volume\n - Mount your old system on /mnt/old or something similar\n - Create a bunch of symlinks from /var/data to /mnt/old/var/data, /home/someone to /mnt/old/home/someone, etc\nIt is not terribly elegant but you will save yourself copying stuff around.\nIf you had your /home and/or /var/data on separate logical volumes then you can just remount them on their new places.\n", "Q: Wrong EFI System Partition GUID? On a new GPT initialized disk (second PC disk) I created a FAT32 partition using gparted.  I want to use it as an EFI System Partition so I flagged it as boot. After that I checked the UUID using the gparted “partition information” option and it reported: 09B1-97A5.  As far as I understand it should be C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B. \nI also checked my running operative system disk (Ubuntu 14) and found that Gparted reports EB78-9AD2 for my actual boot partition UUID. What exactly is gparted reporting as UUID on my EFI system partition and why it doesn’t match with the expected C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B ID?\n\nA: I found the solution. As suggested by a poster the UUIDs on GParted have nothing to do with GPT. I actually found the right GUID using:  sudo gdisk /dev/sda. After that I used the option \"i\"\n\nA: You're confusing filesystem UUIDs with partition GUIDs. The former are stored within the filesystems and can be used in Linux's /etc/fstab file or by the mount command via the UUID= parameter. (Despite the \"UUID\" name, they aren't always true UUIDs. FAT doesn't use UUIDs, for instance, so for FAT, the serial number is used instead of a UUID.) These UUIDs should be unique for any given filesystem, although cloned filesystems might have duplicated UUIDs.\nPartition GUIDs, by contrast, are available only on GPT disks. There are actually two GUIDs associated with a partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*A type code GUID, which is what the C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B figure is. That particular GUID identifies an EFI System Partition (ESP). This is equivalent to the one-byte partition type codes of an MBR disk.\n\n*A partition's unique GUID, which, like a filesystem UUID, should be unique to any particular partition. The EFI uses this GUID internally, and some versions of Linux utilities enable you to use it much like a filesystem UUID, but using the PARTUUID= label rather than UUID=.\n\n", "Q: Windows partition UNKNOWN after Ubuntu installation attempt at dual boot - How to fix?

Two of them are connected to LANs (eth0 and eth1) and one is connected to the internet (eth2); but when I try to access the internet, it attempts to go through eth0 (error responses come from eth0's IP).\nI know that it will work (from experience elsewhere) if I don't set a gateway address for eth0 or eth1, but I have to because for some reason the network manager GUI won't let me save connection settings if no gateway is specified (?).\nHow do I either a) set eth0 and eth1 to not have gateway addresses, or b) tell the system to use eth2 for internet access (that is, IPs not on eth0/eth1's subnets).\nAs for trying to unset eth0 and eth1's gateway addresses: Trying to bypass the network manager GUI, I checked in /etc/network/interfaces but Ubuntu doesn't seem to use it (it only has an entry for lo). I'm not really familiar with more modern ways of configuring interfaces though, and so I gave up there.\n\nA: It sounds like you're looking for a way to set the default gateway. You can see the current settings by running ip route. You probably want yours to look like something like this:\ndefault via 192.168.0.1 dev eth0 ...\n192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0 ...\n192.168.1.0/24 dev eth1 ...\n192.168.2.0/24 dev eth2 ...\n\nThese routes are automatically created by NetworkManager. Try checking Edit ▸ IPv4 Settings ▸ Routes ▸ Use this connection only for resources on its network on the two LAN connections to prevent them from becoming the default gateway.\nYou shouldn't need to work around NetorkManager.\n\nA: If you for some reason uses NetworkManager but don't have a desktop environment, you can configure it in the command-line:\nnmcli connection show\n\nYou should get a list of connections, for example\nNAME                            UUID                                  TYPE       DEVICE  \nMy Wi-Fi AP                     123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000  wifi       wlp3s0  \nWired connection 1              123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001  ethernet   enp0s25 \n\nThen, get the UUID value and execute\nnmcli connection modify 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001 ipv4.never-default yes\n\nThis does the same thing as the other answer (may need disconnect and reconnect for changes to apply)\nAlternative solutions includes using route command to manage default gateway directly; however if you use NetworkManager don't do this (see linked questions on the right pane)\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 14.04 but boot fails after hard reset I installed Windows 7 first then partitioned 30gb in ext4 and installed Ubuntu 64bit and it asked for reboot.

Ubuntu is secure for various reasons, one of them, a major one I believe, is that when you try to install a software/app via terminal/store an authentication box pops up asking you for your password.\nI'm a long-term Windows user, unfortunately, and there are 3 types of user accounts in Windows; Administrator, Standard User and Guest.\nIf I use the Standard User account to do my tasks in Windows 7 then every time I need to install a software an authentication box will pop up asking me for my Administrator password, similar to ubuntu somehow and a security plus for Windows.\nSince both ask for a password then what's the difference if I use Windows 7 as a Standard User vs if I use ubuntu?\n\nA: The most modern linux distribution use a very adjustable and highly configurable tool called sudo. You may have already heard of it. In Windows, when installing a program you have to provide the Adminsitrators password.\nIn Ubuntu the Administrator user (root) is defaultly deactivated. You even don't know his password, no one does, until you changed his password with sudo. A user may gain root priviledges for a short amount of time or for a single task (installing a program for example). This user must have the rights to use sudo (configured in /etc/sudoers). With sudo the program that is executed is executed as the root user.\nThen in graphical sessions driven by gnome, there are other mechanisms to do administrative tasks. One of them is policyKit. There is a daemon running in the background with root priviledges. If, for example, a user wants to shutdown the machine (what only root can) the user talks to this daemon through a secure context (called D-Bus). If granted, the daemon executes the  the system's shutdown command. Those rules are defined in /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/*.\nGnome often comes with a single-sign-on solution called Gnome Keyring. In this keyring your credetials can be stored. When you authenticate via a network share (in nautilus for example) you will be prompted for a password and there is a checkbox to remember you password. That will be stored in the keyring, a database protected with a password. This database will be unlocked during a graphical login process via PAM.\nThen there is AppArmor that is based on SELinux. AppArmor defines profiles for different applications running on the system. Those profiles handle and restrict the access that a specific application needs.\nAll those mechanisms are also implemented into Windows operating systems. Just in a different, less transparent way.\nI can really recommend some lecture of the above mentioned mechanisms, to understand how they work together.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo\n\n*policyKit\n\n*Gnome Keyring\n\n*PAM - Pluggable Authentication Modules\n\n*AppArmor\n\n*SELinux\n\nA: Please consider that Operating System security involves more than prompting for passwords. In fact, password are the weakest form of security because it is simply a shared secret. \nIn both Linux and Windows there are several controls that safeguard your protection from remote crackers, like system execution policies that monitor what programs are allowed to do and take action when they violate a policy (like DEP in Windows (sort of) and SELinux in Linux) preventing the cracker from executing malicious code. Additionally, firewalls help to fend off attackers; and both Windows and Ubuntu have firewalls preinstalled. Unfortunately, in Windows it is possible to simply turn off the admin controls by suppressing the UAC prompt and for all intents and purposes run as if you are the administrator on the system, like in earlier versions of Windows. These are just tools and ways to implement a system securely, and none of them address one core problem of all proprietary code: code quality from a security perspective and intentional back doors (as we have learned from certain former NSA contractors). \nOne reason Linux and other Open Source operating system are more secure is that all the code is peer reviewed. This means that many people can and do review popular code in the open source ecosystem, much like the scientific community review each other’s research. Under this transparency it would be virtually impossible for a government or subversive organization to implement a back door to your system. Nor could the distributor of a system collect unwarranted information about you without the community being aware of it. This openness has demonstrably resulted in a higher level of security for open source software. This applies to other attributes of the open source code as well; like performance, and stability, except where the community is operating under an imposed disadvantage where, for example, a corporate entity refuses so share the specifications of some hardware, making it difficult to build drivers effectively. \nFYI:\nWindows Security Flaws Doubled in 2013, Windows 8 the Most Vulnerable OS | Softpedia News\n\nA: \n… what's the difference in security …?\n\nIn terms of the authentication and filesystem permissions, honestly, not much. We can wax lyrical about policykit and sudoers but these are just technicalities. Windows has had equivalent mechanisms for well over a decade.\nThe core difference was in default settings. A normal, just-bought-a-computer Windows user would have full system write access. No prompts. No UAC. Even though XP could be locked down, its users were indoctrinated into just being able to do stuff, permissions be damned.\nMicrosoft has —despite constant resistance from veteran users— improved on this over time.\nBut the important thing is that users are still, statistically speaking, idiots. If they want something (a repo for a graphics driver, a batch of screensavers, or even dripping wet Warhammer figurines) they're probably going to click the closest thing to Okay! Just install it! until they have what they want.\nA few years ago I wrote how Linux isn't invulnerable. Exactly the same applies to Windows, even today.\nDon't get me wrong, Ubuntu still has a lot on its side:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open source is the big one. You can view almost all the code running on your system (except binary blob drivers and firmwares).\n\n*Ubuntu also has its repositories which are maintained by trusted developers. These make a lot of software available in a safe environment without users needing to go fishing.\n\n*The same mechanism provides system-wide security updates. For non-core software, Windows relies on applications updating themselves. \n\n*Mechanisms like AppArmor and SELinux to sandbox applications, limiting what they can touch.\n\n*A smaller user-base has traditionally meant we're a less juicy target for malware creators.\n\n\nThese are all things that can be sidestepped... 0-Day exploits still affect us and a targeted attack on a user or demographic is just as likely to succeed if everything else is equal. \n", "Q: hostapd error \"nl80211: Could not configure driver mode\" I would like to make a Virtual Router on Ubuntu 12.04\nbut i am getting this error message when i run the last terminal command\nConfiguration file: hostapd.conf\nnl80211: Could not configure driver mode\nnl80211 driver initialization failed.\nhostapd_free_hapd_data: Interface wlan0 wasn't started\n\n\nA: I just had this error on Raspberry pi running Kali linux and hostapd 2.4\nI suspected it is because some other network processes are keeping the interface busy, so I ran this airmon-ng command that checks and kills and processes that might use the wifi card:\nairmon-ng check kill\n\nTo just see any network processes without killing them, use airmon-ng check.\nAfter I killed them, I started hostapd again and no errors came up anymore.\nFor some other network functionality you might need those processes, I restarted the raspberry for that, but they can also be started individually.\n\nA: Just mention that according to the bug linked by @bain, the easiest solution is to disable Network Manager for the interface that is to be run with hostapd.\nAs mentioned there:\nWORKAROUND: For this to persist through reboots, execute the following in a terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nAdd the following entry where the x's are replaced with your WiFi MAC address, save, and then reboot:\n[keyfile]\nunmanaged-devices=mac:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\n\nA: As @bain has rightly pointed out, there is a bug raised in launchpad for this very purpose.

I was asked in an interview why it is that 777 is assigned to take all permissions for a file. Why not 555? He said that there is reason for everything. So, what is the reason for 777? Why not any other number? Is there any significance in this number? \n\nA: In not so many words as the top answer:\nEach file has 3 permissions options: read, write, and execute. You can choose none of these, one of these, two of these, or all of these:\nC(3,0) + C(3,1) + C(3,2) + C(3,3) = 8\n1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8\nSo, altogether, there are 8 combinations; 8 options for permissions. Counting from 0, the last number is 7 (from 0 to 7). So, represented by numbers, here are all the options:\n0 - nothing\n1 - execute\n2 - write\n4 - read\n3 - execute + write (1 + 2)\n5 - execute + read (1 + 4)\n6 - write + read (2 + 4)\n7 - execute + write + read (1 + 2 + 4)\n\nThere are three numbers because the order goes [user permissions][group permissions][others permissions]\nSo, 777 means that all three groups have read, write, and execute permissions.\n\nAlso (indirectly related so you don't necessarily have to read this part), because I think its relevance is important:\nWhy is read number 4 instead of number 3?\n0 - nothing\n1 - execute\n2 - write\n3 - read\n4 - execute + read (1 + 3)\n5 - write + read (2 + 3)\n6 - execute + write + read (3 + 2 + 1)\n7 - ????? no way to get this with the 3 basic options (and we are missing execute + write)\n\nThe only way to get unique combinations for all of the possibilities is to go by powers of 2 for the basic options. 20 = 1 (execute), 21 = 2 (write), 22 = 4 (read), and if there were a 4th basic option it would be numbered 23 = 8. Note that write is not listed until all combinations of previous options have been listed (which is just one option, since it is just execute). read is not listed until all combinations of previous options have been listed (again one, since there is only one combination with two options - execute + write). execute + write + read is not listed until all previous combinations have been listed, which is 3, since there are now two choices from three permissions. The list would continue in this manner, no matter how many basic options there were. For the sake of example, with 4 basic options (note that we also know there will be 16 combinations total since there are 4 options and 24 = 16):\n0 - nothing\n1 - execute\n2 - write\n4 - read\n3 - execute + write (1 + 2)\n5 - execute + read (1 + 4)\n6 - write + read (2 + 4)\n7 - execute + write + read (1 + 2 + 4)\n8 - love\n9 - execute + love (1 + 8)\n10 - write + love (2 + 8)\n11 - execute + write + love (1 + 2 + 8)\n12 - read + love (4 + 8)\n13 - execute + read + love (1 + 4 + 8)\n14 - write + read + love (2 + 4 + 8)\n15 - execute + write + read + love (1 + 2 + 4 + 8)\n\n\nA: I'm surprised so many similar answers that completely miss the mark.\nAfter determining the 3 classes that were needed read, write and execute. They went with octal (3 bits) to minimize the space needed for managing the file system.\n\nA: For some reason, UNIX designers decided to use OCTAL numbers for file permissions. As you know, a maximum value for one-digit octal number is 7. It turned out that one octal digit for user access, one for the group access and one for the world access is enough for nearly everything. Maximum 3digit octal number is 777, and it only makes sense that it denotes \"access to everybody/everything\".\n\nA: Nowadays, we all know that a byte is 8 bits: this has been universally agreed upon for decades. But that wasn't always the case, and Unix (which inspired Linux in many ways) was written during a time when this was still being debated. In particular, it needed to be portable to systems that used 6-bit bytes or 8-bit bytes. Some of the people who wrote it were on one side of the debate, and others were on the other side.\nOn a related note, Base-2 (binary) is not a very convenient notation for writing out values. Nowadays, most programmers write out a more compact notation that uses Base-16 (hexadecimal) instead. 16 is just big enough of a base that you could exactly pack four bits into one hex-digit: for example, \"0000\" in binary is 0x0 in hexadecimal (that \"0x\" is a common way to note that you're about to write a hexadecimal number), while \"1111\" is 0xF (or 15 in decimal). You can actually write any possible combination of four bits using a single hex digit, just by counting in binary, and because of the way positional arithmetic works, you can stack it up: two hex digits can encode any possible combination of eight bits, just by counting, and so on. So the 8-bit folks loved this.\nThe 6-bit folks had their own way of doing this, but instead of using Base-16, they used Base-8 (octal). It has similar advantages to hexadecimal: you can store any position of three bits in an octal-digit, and you can stack digits up in a similar way. So just like the 8-bit folks used two hex-digits for a byte, the 6-bit folks used two octal-digits for a byte. You don't see octal very much anymore, but it was typically noted with a leading zero: for example, \"111\" is 07 in octal.\nNow, what does all of this have to do with Unix permissions? As far as Unix was concerned, there are three things you could do with a file: you could read it, you could write to it, or you could execute it as a program. If you're going to restrict that with permissions, then you need a bit for each of them: turn it on for things that someone is allowed to do, and leave it off for things that someone is not allowed to do. Since there are three things being tracked, you need three bits, and since Unix tracks it along three lines (owner, group, and everyone) you need nine bits total.\nAt some point along the line, someone -probably in the 6-bit camp- said \"Hey, we can use octal-digits for this\". And this turned out to be a very convenient notation: three octal-digits is just enough to encode every possible combination of the bit fields. Once they decided to do this, 777's fate (and 000's) were sealed, because those numbers would be the same no matter how they arranged the bits, but order mattered for all of the other numbers, so they set about doing this.\nThey arranged the permissions into three-bit fields: read at the start, write in the middle, and execute at the end. Then they arranged the fields themselves: owner at the start, group in the middle, and others at the end. Once they'd done this, all they had to do to assign the rest of the numbers was count.\nBecause they're 3-bit fields, you can say that each octal-digit controls one of the fields: the first digit controls owner permissions, the second digit controls group permissions, and the third digit controls other permissions. Thus, 777 (111 111 111) is all permissions for everyone, while 700 (111 000 000) is all permissions only for the owner. Other combinations are also common: 666 (110 110 110) is read/write for everyone but not execute), while 555 (101 101 101) is read/execute for everyone but not write, and 400 (100 000 000) is read-only for the owner and no access for anyone else.\nAnd that's why 777 means all permissions. These days, it's probably the most popular reason for people to use octal at all, though Unix and its descendants still have a few other vestiges of it. For example, od, or Octal Dump, is a way to get binary dumps of a file in octal form (it has a hexadecimal cousin, called xxd, but that's not as well-known and isn't available everywhere). It's also why you need to be careful with leading zeroes in some programming languages, because they might think that you intend to write numbers in octal when that's not really your intent.\n\nA: Reading file permission means 4, writing file permission means 2 and executing file permission means 1.\nSo the total of this is 7.\nNow what is 777: first 7 is for file owner that means file owner have read, right and execute permission. \n2nd 7 is for the group to which the file belongs, it means group also have all the read, write and execute permission.\nAnd 3rd 7 is for others permission\nIf you give the file permission 555 then the file owner, group and others have only read and execute permission not write permission because read permission means 4 and execute means 1 so total gets 5\n\nA: I'll try to address the underlying reason why it is 777, rather than aaa, or 999.\nRemember that permissions come in the following format:\n u   g   o\nrwx rwx rwx\n\nwhere u=user, g=group, o=other.\nNow, imagine you are representing each of these groups as binary. 1 is true, 0 is false.\nIf you want to give full access to everyone, you would assign the following permissions in binary:\n u   g   o\nrwx rwx rwx\n111 111 111\n\nNow, if you know binary, you will realise that when you convert 111 from binary to decimal, you get 7. \nThus, you can represent full access as 777.\nNote: We are really converting from binary to octal. See the edit below.\nThis works for all the other access modes as well.\nFor instance, we can easily work out what 555 means by converting each 5 to binary, and writing it in the above format. 5 in binary is 101, so we have the following permissions:\n u   g   o\nr-x r-x r-x\n101 101 101\n 5   5   5\n\nSimilarly, if we want to give all permissions to the user, but only allow other people to read, we can find a number representation.\n u   g   o\nrwx r-- r--\n111 100 100\n 7   4   4\n\nNow, we know that 111 in binary is 7 in decimal, and 100 in binary is 4 in decimal. Thus, the permissions will be 744.\nEdit:\nTechnically, as highlighted by @LưuVĩnhPhúc and @Braiam, we are converting from binary to octal, as described below. However, the decimal and octal representations of numbers < 8 are the same, so for binary numbers with 3 digits or less, both decimal and octal representations are the same.\nWhen represented as octal numbers, rather than splitting into groups of three, and doing binary to decimal conversion on each group, you can actually take all three groups together as a single binary number, and convert to octal.\nFor example, here are some binary to octal conversions:\n0b111111111 == 0o777\n0b101101101 == 0o555\n0b111100100 == 0o744\n\nNote that I am prepending \"0b\" and \"0o\" to distinguish between binary and octal numbers.\nIf you want to play around with this, open a terminal, run python and then play around with the following commands:\noct(0b111111111)\nbin(0o555)\n\nRemember to prepend \"0b\" or \"0o\" to the numbers to let the computer know what base you are interested in. (If you don't, it will assume base 10.)\n", "Q: deb package building While trying to build a package, I gave the following command in terminal:\ncd Downloads/src/\ncd unity-5.10.0/\ndpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b\n\nThen it gives the output:\ndpkg-buildpackage: export CFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags (origin: vendor): -g -O2 -fstack-protector --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -Wformat -Wformat-security\ndpkg-buildpackage: export CPPFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags (origin: vendor): -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2\ndpkg-buildpackage: export CXXFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags (origin: vendor): -g -O2 -fstack-protector --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -Wformat -Wformat-security\ndpkg-buildpackage: export FFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags (origin: vendor): -g -O2\ndpkg-buildpackage: export LDFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags (origin: vendor): -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-z,relro\ndpkg-buildpackage: source package unity\ndpkg-buildpackage: source version 5.10.0-0ubuntu6\ndpkg-buildpackage: source changed by Didier Roche <didrocks@ubuntu.com>\ndpkg-buildpackage: host architecture i386\ndpkg-source --before-build unity-5.10.0\ndpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: libutouch-grail-dev (>= 1.0.20) libutouch-geis-dev (>= 2.0.10)\ndpkg-buildpackage: warning: Build dependencies/conflicts unsatisfied; aborting.\ndpkg-buildpackage: warning: (Use -d flag to override.)\n\nThen I tried to install the package using:\ncd..\nsudo dpkg -i *deb\n\nAnd it gives:\n[sudo] password for harshnarang8: \ndpkg: error processing *deb (--install):\ncannot access archive: No such file or directory\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n*deb\n\nWhat is exactly causing the problem and how to encounter it?\n\nA: dpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: libutouch-grail-dev (>= 1.0.20) libutouch-geis-dev (>= 2.0.10)\ndpkg-buildpackage: warning: Build dependencies/conflicts unsatisfied; aborting.\n\nlibutouch-grail-dev is one of the build dependencies, but you have not installed it.

Everything went really smoothly with no errors or hiccups during installation. The only thing is I've decided that I just wanna go back to using Windows 8.1. I haven't a clue how to uninstall ubuntu now. I was going to use the windows installer but there wasn't one available, however fund this latest iso which provided a much improved installer which as I said made things go a lot better.\nHas anyone any idea how to uninstall it as I tried the DVD I burnt the iso to and all it gives me the option of is reinstalling ubuntu, there is no option to uninstall once I've installed.\nAny ideas anyone?\n\nA: Why would an operating system need an uninstall option? You uninstall an operating system by installing another one over the current one. \nOr by starting a 2nd operating system and use their version of gParted and delete the partitions the operating system is on that needs removing. \nTo clear a disc from all operating systems you could install gParted, unmount all the discs and delete the partitions until you have 1 big \"unallocated\" space.

Is there a way to switching from fedora without wiping home partition?\nI download cyanogenmod source code and it took about 3 days to downloading 10 GB no way to backup 10 GB\nI can't redownload again but can I switching to ubuntu without remove it\n\nA: \nwithout wiping home partition\n\nMaybe but I would not advice it. Redhat Fedora and Ubuntu are different though you can share a /home between the 2 if you remove Fedora you will have files on your disc that are useless. \nI would do it like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gParted, resize disc, make unallocated space and create a new partition in that unallocated space.\n\n*Move the files you need to save to that new partition.\n\n*Install Ubuntu with format and mount the new partition without a format.\n\n*Move files from the back-up partition to you new /home\n\n\nTip: separates the root (\"/\") and your personal file (\"/ home\"), creating two partition (one for \"/ home\" and one for \"/\"). Thus, in case of re-installation, there will be no need to save the file in \"/ home\" (you'll just have to mount the correct partition in \"/ home\" without formatting)\n\nA: Yes. The Ubuntu installer allows you to map WITHOUT FORMATTING existing partitions. I am not sure about LVM2 configured volumes, but there is a very good chance that the Ubuntu installer will also recognize such volumes.\nAnyway, the trick is to choose the same file system that exists on \"use as\" installer screen box, using a manual partitioning scheme.\nThe best choice will be to boot first in rescue mode (Fedora or Ubuntu ), manually mount each partition, and manually move existing data to a nonstandard  directory  (for example, move your /home to /_home, /usr\nto /_usr)\nThe only partition that needs to be formatted is swap.\nYou can safely delete data on /boot or format the /boot partition if /boot is on separate partition \nOn CentOS/RedHat/Fedora, the current installer has no such option. Instead it is REQUIRED to format the root partition - so if you have /home on the root partition you will lose data. If the underlying OS is the same (CentOS vs. CentOS, same version) the partition will be chosen automatically (as far as i know) by the Anaconda installer.\n", "Q: Totem not playing VCD I am trying to play a VCD, but Totem gives me an error :\nVideos requires to install plugins to support the following multimedia feature: VCD protocol source\n\nSo i did\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nI still get the same error when i try to play the VCD again after installation, so i try :\nsudo apt-get install w64codecs libdvdcss2\n\nBut that gives me the error :\nPackage libdvdcss2 is not available, but is referred to by another package.\nThis may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or\nis only available from another source\n\nE: Unable to locate package w64codecs\nE: Package 'libdvdcss2' has no installation candidate\n\nAny way to make Totem play the VCD?\n\nA: libdvdcss2 isn't a \"standard\" package and has to be installed the following way:\nsudo apt-get install libdvdread4\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh # This downloads and installs libdvdcss2\n\nThis should make Totem play your VCD.

Open the Ubuntu Software Center and search for UNetbootin and install it. \nUNetbootin has been dropped from the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories. When I tested the built-in Startup Disk Creator application as a UNetbootin replacement app with a few non-*buntu live .iso images it worked in Ubuntu 18.04 every time.\nIf you want to install Rufus anyway (because Windows ISOs are supported by Rufus), you should read the README.txt file in the rufus-1.4.7 archive for information about how to compile it.\n\nA: As noted by the error:\n\"In file included from file.c:23:0:\n../rufus.h:18:21: fatal error: windows.h: No such file or directory\n #include \"\nYou are missing header files and perhaps much more.

But I would like to know what Ubuntu's plans are for integrating DRM into Linux?  Especially with Amazon's integration into the search tool, one would hope that they would make it easier for their Amazon Prime customers to watch Instant Videos.\nIs the repository for getting Hal for 13.10 safe for use?  What will that break if I install it onto 14.04?  Or do we need to find another OS that has DRM built into it?\nIf Hal is okay to add to the OS using a third party repo, then why doesn't Ubuntu Software Center support it too?  I imagine that Amazon's contract with the video copyright holders requires that they have some protection on electronically distributed media.  I also imagine that getting Amazon to change is much harder than getting a bunch of software engineers to fix Ubuntu.  Unless they don't want too.  At which point Ubuntu isn't really a complete OS.  Very disappointing.  In general the ease of use of Ubuntu, the software center, and the large variety of applications was alluring.  But breaking DRM wasn't a great idea.  Can't wait to see what fails in our next update.\nPlease tell us that there is a plan that is going to work in our future.\n\nA: To answer your question without unhelpful sarcastic remarks [Dobey], I found this link VERY helpful: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/10/fixing-amazon-prime-streaming-drm-protected-flash-13-10\nIt still works on 14.04 for me.\nIn addition:\nAny OS that cannot garner the support of vendors that it links to directly in its own default searching functions is worth complaining about.

How do I automatically update image links while in full-screen presentation mode? (Think of a display that has to show an updating traffic map or something)\n\nA: Edit: The method outlined in this answer will still require user input to update the images before entering presentation mode. It is not capable of automatically updating images while in presentation mode.\nOriginal answer:\n\nLinking an image in LibreOffice Impress\nYou can do this by linking the images instead of inserting them.\nGo to Insert → Picture → From file.... Select your file and check Link in the file selection dialog that comes up:\n\nConfirm your choice with OK. A new dialog should spawn that will ask you to confirm linking the image instead of inserting it. Click on OK again.\nFrom now on any changes to the image will automatically show up when reloading the document. You can also update your links through the Link Editor (Edit → Links...):\n\nFor more information on linking/inserting images check out the link Korkel posted.\nAs an aside: If you are interested in linking images by default you should give this Q&A a look. Note: The CTRL + SHIFT workaround posted there doesn't appear to be working in LO Impress.\n\nA: There is currently no way to have Impress, while in presentation mode, update an image as it changes on the disk. \nOne alternate solution, if you only need an image slideshow, is to use the Gnome Image Viewer ('eog' command from terminal) since it will reflect changes to the image file while in slideshow mode, however, if you need captions outside of the image then this method will not work.\n", "Q: OS X no longer visible in rEFInd boot after installing Ubuntu I installed rEFInd to ESP on my Macbook Pro Retina running Mavericks (with FileVault on).

There is no trace of my OS X disk and the only way I can boot into it is by selecting the disk from an Option-boot screen.\nHow do I fix this so that both my OS X and Ubuntu are displayed?\n\nA: Try setting scan_delay 1 in the refind.conf file. (That file should be in the EFI/refind/ directory on your /dev/disk0s1//dev/sda1 partition.) Sometimes rEFInd doesn't scan some partitions in its default configuration. This seems to be the result of an EFI that's sluggish about registering its partitions, so they don't show up when rEFInd first starts. Adding a delay to the scan works around this problem.\n\nEDIT: Sorry; I didn't notice that you're using encryption. Try uncommenting the dont_scan_volumes option in refind.conf and remove \"Recovery HD\" from the list.\n\nA: Try adding a custom menu entry for OS X in refind.conf:\nmenuentry \"OS X\" {\n  icon EFI/refind/icons/os_mac.icns\n  volume \"Mac\"\n  loader /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\n  ostype MacOS\n}\n\n", "Q: How to permanently disable sleep/suspend? Subtly broken is worse than frankly broken...\nBackground:\n\n\n*\n\n*I already disabled suspend in System Settings -> Power.\n\n*The \"Suspend\" option still appears on the gear menu (not that I expected it to disappear), and the sleep (moon) button on my keyboard still triggers suspend.\n\n*The options in #1 are, as others have pointed out, just too easy to hit by mistake once every month or so.\n\n*It seems like 1% of platforms get suspend right, because some driver engineer somewhere forgot to check that PCIe or IO space register X gets restored when upon wake. So it's worse than broken: everything usually looks fine after waking up, only it's not. And hopefully none of those corrupted registers affects reliability in a creeping manner, like ECC configuration or storage FIFO depth. But they usually do, in one form or another, which is one reason, for example, why errata against graphics drivers continue infinitely, years after they debut on the market (\"graphics chip X hangs an hour after resuming from suspend blah blah blah\").\n\n*There should be an automated test to see what registers change across a sleep cycle, but few vendors have such a test. The test is complicated somewhat by the fact that some registers are expected to change, such as timers. And worse, sometimes you have to read registers in a certain order or with a particular granularity, or by first writing a read index somewhere else. So this process cannot be centralized at a convenient place in the industry, like Canonical's offices. It's really and truly hopeless unless PCIe is redefined in such a manner that makes comparison easy, which it won't be.\n\n*The magical test suite in #5 will never be written because of the chaotic state of driver development. Hence in the absence of that, my question.\n\n*I'm so desperate that I don't mind hacking on /etc/whatever_suspend_file, but it would be nice if there were a \"polite\" way to do this, like that nonexistent checkbox in System Settings -> Power that says \"Permanently disable suspend because it was ill-conceived from day one.\"\n\n*NB: I'm not talking about hibernation here, which shouldn't suffer from the problems above because it involves a power cycle. Although in principle, restoring registers from permanent storage could have similar problems.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.* try this.\nGo to:  \n\n\n*\n\n*System Settings  \n\n\nClick on:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Brightness & Lock  \n\n*Turn screen off when inactive  \n\n*Set it to 'Never'\nHope it helps :)\n\nA: According to the Debian Wiki, you can also disable it via systemd like so:\nsudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target\n\nWhile I have done this on my machine, I can't attest to its effectiveness.

It also works on OSX with SuperTuxKart (I know, a professional way to try it out.)\n\nA: Unfortunately it is not available directly as a binary, but you can easily compile it using the following commands:\nGet some dependencies:\nsudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev git jstest-gtk joystick\n\nDownload the source:\ngit clone https://github.com/thk/LTWheelConf.git\n\nBuild the source:\ncd LTWheelConf\nmake\n\nYou should now have an executable named ltwheelconf.\nInstall\nsudo cp ltwheelconf /usr/local/bin/\n\n\nUse LTWheelConf\nList all found/supported devices\nsudo ltwheelconf --list\n\nSupported wheel shortname values:\n'DF' (Driving Force)\n'MR' (Momo Racing)\n'MF' (Momo Force)\n'DFP' (Driving Force Pro)\n'DFGT' (Driving Force GT)\n'G25' (G25)\n'G27' (G27)\nSet wheel to native mode\nsudo ltwheelconf --wheel <your-wheel-shortname> --nativemode\n\nSet wheel rotation range of 900 degrees\nsudo ltwheelconf --wheel <your-wheel-shortname> --range 900\n\nExamples:\nPut wheel into native mode:\nsudo ltwheelconf --wheel G25 --nativemode\n\nSet wheel rotation range to 540 degree:\nsudo ltwheelconf --wheel G27 --range 540\n\nSet moderate autocenter:\nsudo ltwheelconf --wheel DFP --autocenter 100 --rampspeed 1\n\nDisable autocenter completely:\nsudo ltwheelconf --wheel G25 --autocenter 0 --rampspeed 0\n\nSet native mode, disable autocenter and set wheel rotation range of 900 degrees in one call:\nsudo ltwheelconf --wheel DFGT --nativemode --range 900 --autocenter 0 --rampspeed 0\n\n\nAutomagically invokes LTWheelConf\nWe can add a rule to UDEV to automatically invoke LTWheelConf when the steering wheel is connected.\nThis can be done using the following command (use the correct shortname instead of !):\n\necho 'ATTRS{idVendor}==\"046d\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"c294\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/ltwheelconf --wheel <your-wheel-shortname> --nativemode --range 900\"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/90-logitech-wheel.rules\n\nNow you need to restart UDEV:\nsudo service udev restart\n\n\nExtra information from Elder Geek what can be found here.\n", "Q: ftp in xammp or vsftpd I just know XAMPP can provide web, SQL and FTP services on the server. Also I know vsftpd gives ftp service. So which one to choose if some one wants to give his server ftp service?\nWhich one do you advise? Are they have any different which make one of them better than another way?\n\nA: VSFTPD is the most secure.\nInstall vsftpd and a PAM library and you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create user accouts with custom directories (in /var/www/ for example)\n\n*Set directories with the correct chmod and chown\n\n*Create a admin user with full access to the server\n\n*Troubleshoot\n\n*create FTP users but no local unix users (no shell access, no home directory and so on).  aka virtual users.\n\n", "Q: How to take ownership of a PPA? Say there's a software that wasn't created for Ubuntu but someone creatred a PPA for it and I use that PPA.\nNow the PPA owner, doesn't want to maintain the PPA anymore. Can I ask the owner to hand it over, so that I maintain the ppa? If so how? And what does maintaining the PPA require besides updating the code?\n\nA: Your question is very broad, but I will try to give some guidance. \nContact the current ppa owner and coordinate your efforts. You can skin the cat more then one way, probably easiest to make a work group that maintains the ppa. Perhaps the old maintainer can (briefly) mentor you.\nhttps://help.launchpad.net/Teams/CreatingAndRunning\nIf you do not know how to package, I highly suggest you read the packaging guidelines. http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/\nLaunchpad / a ppa greatly automates much of the process, but nothing replaces at least a working knowledge of packaging, especially if you hope one day to have your package in the Debian / Ubuntu repositories.\nOn the flip side, improper packaging often causes problems / compatibility problems.\nNext read the ppa tutorial - https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA\n", "Q: Need advice for programming languages for a custom GUI I just transitioned from windows to Ubuntu and so far loving it. On my list of tasks is to develop a GUI interface for collecting data from a remote device through RS232, compile and display the results. Currently my plans are to make a simple logic analyzer to display waveforms and a customized data logger for displaying text data as well as a graphing the results.\nI have experience on the embedded side with C/C++, assembler and some Java, plus good old basic. But unfortunately the PC side is total new to me and I’m getting overwhelmed with my research.\nMy questions are:\n1) What is the native (loosely used) language for Linux for API development?\n2) What is the best way to collect and buffer data from a RS232 device?\n\nA: I'd personally go with Java, since it's multiplatform and simpler than C++. You can use JavaFx for your GUI (Swing is also an option, but it seems that JavaFx is the official GUI framework now) and java-simple-serial-connector for interfacing with the serial port.\n\nA: Try Ubuntu SDK, a plugin for Qt Creator. Qt Creator uses C++ and is the only to support developing for Ubuntu for phones and tablets. It is also easy to make a GUI, with or w/o C++ (you can write a pure QML application). It is also cross-platform, so you can build for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.\n", "Q: How to set Shutter as default screenshoter in Ubuntu 14.04 I'm using standard Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity, how come I cannot set Shutter as default screenshoter anymore? I tried everything I knew, I purged it and reinstalled it completely, set it in Compiz Settings Manager shutter -f and shutter -a ticked the Gnome Compatibility Plugin, even rebooted the system completely still it doesn't react when I press PrintScreen instead basic screenshoter takes a screenshot. Is there something else has changed with compatibility?\n\nA: Go to keyboard under system settings, and create a new custom shortcut.  \n\nOnce created, click on disabled, and once it changes to new accelerator, just press PrintScreen button, and you're all set.\n\n", "Q: Why does terminal auto complete sometimes not suggest anything for the `services` command? Sometimes, when I type a command on the terminal, the terminal's autocomplete does not work, even if my command is not wrong.\nFor example, take look to this: sudo service vsftpd status sudo and service do not have any problem. I mean, when you type sud +tab terminal suggest you sudo or I type servi + tab terminal complete that to service. But for vsftpd I do not get any suggestion. Is there a way to say, \"terminal, please tell me any suggestion!!?\".\n\nA: vsftpd has probably more than 1 option. tab twice to view the possibilities.\nExample: li with tabtab shows:\nlibnetcfg          line               lintian-info       lispmtopgm\nlibreoffice        linguist           linux32            listres\nlightdm            link               linux64            \nlightdm-session    lintian            linux-boot-prober  \n\n\nA: You can build your own!\nE.g.:  put complete -f -r -c su -d 'Username' -a '(cat /etc/passwd|cut -d : -f 1)' into bash than if you have su and press tab/tab it gives you all users, yeah. See here\n\nA: The degree to which auto-completion works is a function of how well the shell scripts in the bash-completion package work.\nIn Ubuntu 14.04, the script that handles completions for service is in /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion.  It looks for service names as files in /etc/rc.d/init.d and /etc/init.d, and in the output of systemctl list-units --full --all.\nBut installing the vsftpd package doesn't put any files in /etc/init.d, because it has been systemd-ified; it puts a config file in /etc/systemd/system/vsftpd.service. systemctl list-units would find that file if not for the fact that Ubuntu, at the present time, doesn't include a systemctl command.\nSo, at the moment, you won't get auto-completions for service vsftpd, but you will for most other services, since their config files are in /etc/init.d.\n\nA: When there are multiple possible suggestions, tab will not produce any suggestion. Using tab tab (double tab) will produce a list of all possible suggestions. \n\nA: I've found that systemctl list-units --full --all does not list disabled services, so autocompletion doesn't\n# check if enabled\nsystemctl is-enabled <service_name>\n# enable\nsystemctl enable <service_name>\n\n\nA: The services command relies on \"systemctl list-units --full --all\", and does not list services that are unable to start (or disabled as above), to confirm if you experiencing this issue you can run \nsystemctl status <service_name>\n\n", "Q: Nothing appears on the Panel in Ubuntu 14.04 I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04. This was my first Ubuntu installation. The Unity Launcher and Panel did not appear at first but I fixed it by searching from the internet. Now the Panel appears, but it's empty. Only the title of the active window appears and nothing else. The power button, the clock, mail, sound, other indicators nothing appears.\nI tried resetting and reinstalling unity. I tried killall unity-panel-services but it says no process found.\n\nA: Try the following commands in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\nsetsid unity\n\nunity --reset-icons\n\nEdit: Is this helping you?\n\nA: open startup application and add this command\n\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/indicator-application/indicator-application-service\n\n\nafter logout and login again to your account\n", "Q: Must I install Ubuntu to use it fully? What is the difference between running Ubuntu on a Live USB and on internal hard drive?\n\nA: From experience, I have found the live USB to be slow / sluggish in performance - also, you will not be able to save any changes made once you shutdown\nWith an install on your HDD, you get the best experience and able to enjoy to its fullest, ie. install / save changes and improved performance levels\nI hope that helps\n\nA: When you use a live USB you can't save your work and programs that you install are lost when you shutdown the pc.\nWhen you install Ubuntu you can do everything normal, and install programs and save your work. :)\n", "Q: Always show menu in LibreOffice I'd like to always see the application menu, but by default that's hidden until I mouse onto the top line of the screen. Perhaps this is aesthetically pleasing, but it sucks in terms of usability.\nI saw this old question about the same problem but the solutions there must be outdated. At least they don't work on my 14.04 system.\nThe purge-and-reinstall trick didn't work for me, it's the same as before.\nHow can I make the LibreOffice application menu always be visible?\n\nA: You can disable the global menu for all applications. Look here.\nYou can also make the menu appear on the window title bar, by going to Appearance > Behaviour.\n\nA: Whilst this question is very specific about always displaying the menu in LibreOffice, you now have the ability in 14.04 (as long as you are fully up-to-date) to switch on the global & local window menus permanently on a Unity wide basis.\nThis ability was back-ported from 15.04 which has this ability (and is set permanently on)\nTo switch on permanently:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity always-show-menus true\n\nTo switch off i.e. to autohide:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity always-show-menus False\n\n", "Q: WARNING: terminal is not fully functional despite xterm-color I have two Ubuntu VMs. On one of them, whenever I run git diff or git log, I see:\nWARNING: terminal is not fully functional\nI then get a horrible, monocolour diff (yech). \nHow do I fix this? I already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting TERM to xterm-color, ansi, and yes, even msys (all to no avail)\n\n*Restarting my machine\n\n*Checking that TERM is set to something sane (xterm by default)\n\n\nI ended up editing ~/.bashrc to set TERM to xterm-color, which makes my terminal prompts look MOAR awesome, but doesn't solve this one problem with Git.\n\nA: This resolved itself. I think it was multiple reboots (host and guest) that finally got it to work.\n", "Q: Downgrade to GCC < v3.0 For some reason I have to downgrade my GCC to version 2.x using apt-get (not downloading and compiling the source)\nIs that possible? If yes, how can I find the repository address and install it via apt-get?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: No.\nNot using apt-get, GCC 2.x predates Ubuntu !\nI managed to locate GCC 2.95 at http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/debian/pool/main/g/gcc-2.95/\nYou could download the appropriate version and install using the dpkg -i pathto/filename.deb command. Who knows if it will work, or have any issues with dependencies and then you would for sure need to use apt-pinning to prevent Ubuntu installing a more modern version - really not worth even trying IMHO.\n\nA: I'm afraid you are entering in a private hell.\nSince GCC 2.x predates Ubuntu the risk is to hang somehow the system.\nHave you considered to install Virtualbox in your Ubuntu machine and an old image of linux compatible with GCC 2.x? It's possible to download even a pre installed images of such kind of systems ready to use.\nSince a program that requires GCC 2.x is rather old, probably it will not suffer to run in an emulated environment, and you can share part of the file system between the virtual machine and the Ubuntu host. \n", "Q: .desktop file not working I have a .desktop file that contains these lines:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Firestorm\nComment=Client for Online Virtual Worlds, such as Second Life\nExec=/home/deus/Programs/Firestorm_64bit/firestorm\nIcon=/home/deus/Programs/Firestorm_64bit/firestorm_icon.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\nStartupWMClass=do-not-directly-run-firestorm-bin\nCategories=Application;Network;\nStartupNotify=true\n\nI just re-installed Ubuntu 14.04 before the reinstall this file worked just fine.

The problem is that when script terminates the terminal window becomes useless as there is no more command prompt.\ni.e. I can save my layout and put a command \"top\" in layout config. The next time I start Terminator \"terminator -m  -l mylayout &\" it will open my layout, execute command \"top\" in the respective sub terminal, but if I press \"q\" to quit \"top\" that terminal doesn't have command prompt any more. \nIs there a way to fix it?\nAnd, Is there a way to pass commands to terminal windows inside Terminator layout from a separate gnome-terminal window?\n\nA: I also wanted to start a Terminator session by executing a script and then starting a bash shell. This is how I did it:\nIn Terminator's Preferences, on the 'Layouts' tab, select the desired Layout on the left and then select the desired Terminal on the right.\nIn the 'Custom command' field, enter the command followed by && bash || bash. This will initiate a new bash shell whether the command/script was successful or not. \nThe bash after && will execute after a successful exit code (0). The bash after || executes after an error exit code (1-255).\nExample: \nTo execute top and then exit into a new bash shell, enter this in the 'Custom command' field.\ntop && bash || bash\n\nAnother example:\nSay you needed some encouragement to get the day started off on the right foot.\necho -e \"\\nWelcome! You are going to have a productive day!\\n\" && bash || bash\n\nThen, to run the command specified, start terminator with the -l option followed by your layout name.\nterminator -l mylayout\n\n\nA: You can use a custom profile for terminals you want to keep open after the command exits. See the Profile, Command tab in Prefs.You can either have them just hold open till you explicitly close them, or you can have them restart the command (either the bash, or the custom command.)\nAnother trick I recently learned is to use the following as your custom command:\nbash --rcfile <(echo \". ~/.bashrc && ls -l\")\n\nIt sources your bash startup, executes a command (ls), then deposits you in the same bash process. It is slightly better than the practice of tacking bash on the end of the command.\n\nA: I know this is an older question but I spent some time trying to figure it out today and none of this was working for me. I stumbled accross this blog post that did exactly what I needed. So I figured I would share.\nBasically, you add this snippet to your .zshrc or .bashrc:\necho $INIT_CMD\nif [ ! -z \"$INIT_CMD\" ]; then\n    OLD_IFS=$IFS\n    setopt shwordsplit\n    IFS=';'\n    for cmd in $INIT_CMD; do\n        print -s \"$cmd\"  # add to history\n        eval $cmd\n    done\n    unset INIT_CMD\n    IFS=$OLD_IFS\nfi\n\nAnd then you set this as your custom command:\nenv INIT_CMD=\"cd bla; export PYTHONPATH=/tmp; workon project\" zsh\n\nThat lets you string multiple commands together and then when you end a persistent command with Ctrl+C the terminal stays open.\n", "Q: Create a custom syntax highlight in gedit Following my question from long ago, I am still trying to tweak my fortune handling capabilities. The display in terminal is awesome, just one thing remains - syntax highlighting in Gedit as I add, edit or delete individual fortunes.\nMy custom fortune files are in this format:\nFriend: \"Whats a good movie?\"\nMe: \"Snakes on a plane\"\nFriend: \"Whats it about?\"\nMe: \"Horses... horses on a boat...\"\n@AYYSIAN\n%\nMe on my wedding: you still like me, right?\n@ComedyPosts\n%\nMum: Son I'd love to meet your girlfriend...\nMe: Me too...\n@ComedyTruth\n%\nDoctor: \"Ok, so what's wrong, how are you feeling?\"\nMe: *Looks at mum waiting for her to explain*\n@ChildhoodFact\n%\nFriend: 75% of people are good at maths...\nMe: Mmmmh, I guess then am in the remaining 18%...\n@TheFunnyTeens\n%\nI loved the Titanic.

Otherwise find the directory in multivol_snapshot/ at the path where your file used to be: you need to join together all the files in this directory to recreate the original file.  The files are numbered, and can be joined together using the cat command.  Depending on how large the original was, there may be many parts.\nProblem with original instructions\nThe directions linked above suggest using cat * > rescued-file.  Unfortunately this simple approach fails if you have more than 9 parts.  Since * expands in dictionary order, not numeric order, 10 would be listed before 2, and the file would be reconstructed in the wrong order.\nWorkaround\nOne simple approach is to remember that dictionary order does work when numbers are the same length, and that ? matches a single character.  So if your largest file has three digits, you can manually enter:\ncat ? ?? ??? > rescued-file\n\nAdd or remove ? patterns as necessary, depending on the largest file number.\nScript\nIf you have a lot of files to recover and don't fancy typing that for all of them, you might prefer to use a script such as this.  It lists the containing directory for every file, removes duplicates from the list, then goes to each directory and creates a content file from the fragments there.  (spacer is just to make $1 work.)\nfind multivol_snapshot/ -type f -printf '%h\\0' | \\\n  sort -uz | \\\n  xargs -0 -n 1 sh -c 'cd \"$1\" ; cat $(ls | sort -n) > content' spacer\n\nNow you just have to add /content to the end of any filename you were looking for, and you should find it.\nLimitations\nThis doesn't restore any of the original file permissions or ownership.  It also doesn't deal with incremental backups, but then the linked instructions also hit a bit of a dead end on this point — they just suggest using rdiff 'to stitch the files together' and refer the reader to man rdiff.\nsource : SF SE\nhere you can find a java program for easy restoration of complicated backup.\n\nA: *\n\n*Use duplicity to extract it:\nduplicity restore file:///path_to_folder_contains_backups/ path_where_to_extract_it/\n\n\n*Enter GnuPG passphrase, Press Enter\nBy default, Duplicity restores last backup (comparing time) in the source folder even its not the backup for the same folder. If you have multiple backups for different folders or you want specific time of same folder, use --time option example:\nduplicity restore --time 20140106T111233Z file:///path_to_folder_contains_backups/ path_where_to_extract_it/\n\nUnable to see the files you are looking for, try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create function that list all files contained in all full/inc backups available in the source folder:\nldup () {\n    for f in $(ls $1/duplicity-*.manifest.gpg); do\n        echo \"========================================================================\"; \n        echo $f;\n        n=$(basename $f .manifest.gpg);\n        prefix=$(echo $n | awk 'BEGIN { FS = \".\" } ;{ print $1 }');\n        if [[ \"$prefix\" == \"duplicity-full\" ]]; then\n            t=$(echo $n | awk 'BEGIN { FS = \".\" } ;{ print $2 }');\n        else\n            t=$(echo $n | awk 'BEGIN { FS = \".\" } ;{ print $4 }');\n        fi;\n        echo -e \"Creation time:\\t\" $t;\n        echo \"------------------------------------------------------------------------\";\n        duplicity list-current-files --time $t file://$1/ | grep \"$2\";\n    done;\n}\n\n\n*To list all files (note without tail /):\nldup /path_to_folder_contains_backups\n\n\n*search for a pattern in file names:\nldup /path_to_folder_contains_backups pattern\n\nReference: man duplicity\n\nA: Déjà Dup uses an opaque format for files stored in your backup location.

The thing is that the Debian packaging magic that is invoked via debuild would recognize a makefile and do the right\nmake\nmake install DESTDIR=???\n\nthing and get it working right. When I only have a setup.py sitting there and have dh $@ --with python3 --buildsystem pybuild in debian/rules, it will correctly install the Python module with\npython3 setup.py build\npython3 setup.py install --install-layout deb --root=??? ???\n\nI do not know all those flags. And I think that I do not need to. I just want the makefile magic to happen, and then the setup.py magic.\nHow can I tell debuild to do both?\nWhen I do the following in debian/rules\n%:\n        dh $@\n        dh $@ --with python3 --buildsystem pybuild\n\nit will only put the first one into the resulting package. I tried to delete the debhelper.log between those, but that did not change much.\n\nA: You can use both but in that case your debian/rules will exclusively use overrides:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n\n%:\n    dh $@ --with=python3\n\noverride_dh_auto_build:\n    make universe-explode-in-delight\n    cd python_src && python3 setup.py build\n\noverride_dh_auto_test:\n    cd python_src && python3 setup.py test\n\noverride_dh_auto_install:\n    cd python_src && python3 setup.py install \\\n        --force --root=$(CURDIR)/debian/tmp \\\n        --no-compile -O0 --install-layout=deb\n    make install_non_python_stuff\n\noverride_dh_auto_clean:\n    cd python_src && python3 setup.py clean\n\nSee: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/dh.1.html\n", "Q: Show login text with Byobu When I log into my server, I'm usually greeted with a bunch of stats, like this:\n\nBut if I enable byobu on login (through byobu-enable), I don't get to see the stats.\nI'm immediately presented to byobu when I login:\n\nOf course, the stats are output, but byobu immediately clears the screen.\nIs there any way to see the stats while still having Byobu run at login?\n\nA: The dynamic statistics that Ubuntu shows normally when you log in are contained in the file /run/motd.dynamic. This file is normally displayed when you log in, but as you correctly noticed, byobu clears the screen so it can't be seen. What you need to do is arrange for that file to be printed when the first byobu shell is started.\nOne way to accomplish this that works for me is to add the following shell snippet to your ~/.bashrc file. It will run for every new shell process, but the motd will only be shown once in the first tmux window that is started.\nif [ -z \"$_motd_listed\" ]; then\n  case \"$TMUX_PANE\" in\n    %1) cat /run/motd.dynamic\n        export _motd_listed=yes\n        ;;\n    *)  ;;\n  esac\nfi\n\n\nA: Building on the accepted answer, I tested / added same condition for screen based session which has $WINDOW=0 for first screen so the combination for tmux and screen based sessions looks like this:\nif [ -z \"$_motd_listed\" ]; then\n  case \"$TMUX_PANE\" in\n    %1) cat /run/motd.dynamic\n        export _motd_listed=yes\n        ;;\n    *)  ;;\n  esac\n  case \"$WINDOW\" in\n    0) cat /run/motd.dynamic\n        export _motd_listed=yes\n        ;;\n    *)  ;;\n  esac\nfi\n\n", "Q: Which hidden files and directories do I need? In a previous question, I explained my situation/plan:  backing up home directory on external drive, reformatting laptop drive, installing 14.04, putting home directory back.  (It hasn't happened yet because I can't seem to find the down time, in case things aren't working right away.)\nIt occurred to me that maybe I don't want all of those hidden files and directories (e.g. .local/share/ubuntuone/syncdaemon/, .cache/google-chrome/, etc.)  Just judging by the amount of time in copying, I can tell that some of these hidden directories are large.\nQuestion:  Are there any hidden directories that I obviously don't need/want when I have the laptop running an updated distribution?  Will they cause conflicts?  (I plan on copying the backed-up directory tree back onto the laptop with the --no-clobber option.)\n\nA: Unless you have a custom configuration file that you manually edited / wrote you do not \"need\" any of them. Ones you might like to keep would be .mozilla (for firefox), .ssh (for ssh keys), and .gpg (if you use gpg), and .bashrc/.zshrc/.vimrc, if you have a custom file(s).\n", "Q: shrink ext4 partition on raid 10 My question is similar to Move ext4 partition, but the challenge I couldn't figure out is how to shrink a partition from the start.\nSo suppose originally the partition (with raid) is like this.\n(************** /dev/md127 ***************)\n\nAfter resizing, I want to achieve like this.\n(*** unallocated ***)(**** /dev/md127 ****)\n\nNote, I cannot use gparted, and parted does not support ext4.\nThe commands I have tried so far,\n% resize2fs -p /dev/md127 1676G    # <== This is good.\n\n% lvreduce -L 1676G /dev/md127\nPath required for Logical Volume \"md127\"\nPlease provide a volume group name\nRun `lvreduce --help' for more information.\n\nThen I found some link (http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-resize-raid-partitions-shrink-and-grow-software-raid) that describing how to change partition of raid.\n$ mdadm --grow /dev/md127 --size=max\nmdadm: Cannot set device size for /dev/md127: Invalid argument\n\nFailed here, \"man mdadm\" shows that \"--grow\" does not with raid 10.

(************** /dev/md127 ***************)\n\n2. (**** /dev/md127 ****)(*** new partition **)\n\n3. (*** unallocated ****)(**** /dev/md127 ****)\n\nThanks.\n\nA: You have some confusion in your question that needs cleared up first, but it looks like the answer is that you can not do what you want.\nFirst, lvresize is for changing the size of an lvm logical volume, so is not applicable to /dev/md127 because that is a raid array.  Second, you asked to have unallocated space preceeding /dev/md127, which does not make sense because it is a raid array, so there is no space before or after it, in terms of the raid array.  The raid may be built on top of partitions, like /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1, so that must be where you want preceding free space.  mdadm can change the size of /dev/sda1 that is used for the raid, allowing you to use parted to shrink that partition, but that only moves the end of the array and partition, not the start.  There is no way to move the start.\n", "Q: How do I access files on an MTP device? I can't play music or view photos from my phone on Ubuntu 14.04. I can browse the files with the Nautilus, but they won't open.

How can I fix?\n*Edit: I just tried copying the file from my phone to my disk, and sure enough it works just fine and now the file opens. After googling some more, someone said you can't stream the file from Android and it has to be copied locally because it's a \"functional limitation of MTP.\" Is this true? It's able to stream in Windows...\n\nA: it might be a limitation of the MTP implementation in Ubuntu 14.04.  i was having the same problem in 14.04, and i changed the setting on my Android device to PTP instead.  now i can open files directly from the device.  it appears that all of the same files/directories are available in PTP mode, so hopefully this solves your issue.\n", "Q: I installed Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 to be dual-booted with windows 8.1, but after the restart, it only boots to windows.

I want to put some pictures and videos from my account on to theirs.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: It's very simple. Here it's not really sharing; because users are on the same PC, you are just copying or moving files between directories.\nYou can navigate to user account cd /home/user/ , then you can move your files into their Documents folder for example:\ncp /home/your-user/testfile /home/their-user/Documents/\n\n\nA: There are several ways to do this.  The easiest way would be to make a folder in /home, let's call it share and give it permissions for all users to read and write to the folder with chmod 776.  This isn't the most secure way to go about doing it, as it allows anyone with access to the system to put files into the folder.  The folder permissions would look like this (if you used ls -l):\ndrwxrwxrw- user user 4096 share\n\na more secure way to allow sharing between accounts would be through the use of groups and folder permissions.  Here are the steps:\n1) Add a group called familyshare:\nsudo groupadd family share\n\n2) Add the user you created for your family (let's call it family, but it can be whatever you want) to the group:\nsudo useradd -G familyshare family\n\n3) Create the directory that you want to share with your family in /home (let's call this directory share)\ncd /home\nsudo mkdir share\nchown :familyshare share\nchmod 774 share\n\n4) Check the permissions on the directory and test it with the family user:\nls -l /home\n#you should see something that looks like this\ndrwxrwxr-- user familyshare 4096 share\nsu family\ncd /home/share\nmkdir test\n\nIf everything went according to plan, there should be a folder called test inside the share directory.  Anyone who is a member of the group familyshare should be able to read, write, and execute files in the share directory.  If you do not want them to be able to execute files, but still read and write, you can change the permissions to using chmod 764 on the share directory.\n", "Q: Intel wireless 7260 does not work on Ubuntu 12.04 I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Lenovo x240 laptop which has a Intel Wireless 7260. I don't know why the network connection does not show anything. Actually nothing comes up; no internet connection.\nCould someone help me with the steps to figure it out?\n\nA: The kernel in 12.04 doesn't include the driver for your card, so you'll need to grab that first:\nwget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.15-rc1/backports-3.15-rc1-1.tar.gz\ntar xzf backports-3.15-rc1-1.tar.gz\ncd backports-3.15-rc1-1\nmake defconfig-iwlwifi\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThen, you'll need the firmware for your card:\nwget http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=iwlwifi-7260-ucode-22.24.8.0.tgz\ntar xzf iwlwifi-7260-ucode-22.24.8.0.tgz\nsudo cp iwlwifi-7260-ucode-22.15.8.0/iwlwifi-7260-8.ucode /lib/firmware/\n\nAnd finally, reboot:\nsudo reboot\n\n(By the way, you just did a fresh install of 12.04? You know that 14.04 is out, right?)\n\nA: The problem is not with the driver or any packages. The kernel is not able to load the driver.\nThe solution that worked for me is that I upgraded the Kernel to 4.2.042 and rebooted. I had problem with ethernet as well as wifi. This one upgrade solved both the issues without installing any additional packages.\nKernel 4.0 onwards comes with built in support for multiple hardwares. Ubuntu officially doesn't support 4.2.042 kernel for Ubuntu 12.04. You can install the kernel of ubuntu 14.04 onto 12.04. After exhausting all the solutions provided by others I finally got it working with this update.   \nPC Model is Dell Optiplex 5040.\nThese kernel packages are upward compatible from ubuntu server 12.04 to ubuntu 16.04.\n", "Q: Installing IcedTeaPlugin for Chrome I am trying to get the java plugin to work on chrome but have failed so far.

Yet when I go to the browser the plugin does not work. The plugin does not even show up on the chrome plugins page. I have restarted the browser as well.

I just want to make the videos compatible with all the browsers/devices. \nThe videos are not working on Firefox on most devices and on Chrome in a specific Android device that I have.\nEDIT: When i play the embeded videos on firefox, on any android device, it goes straight to the end and doesn't play. It only plays if i click in the progress bar.\nIf i open the videos on firefox without embedding them in a html page, they seem to have a bigger width box outside then, while the video is inside it.\nI uploaded a video that i converted.

The video plays as normal in Chromium, but not Firefox 30 (Linux) or Aurora 31 (Windows).  When I used ffmpeg (of which avconv is a fork) a couple of months back, all worked as expected.\nWhat I have noticed is that on Firefox, the progress bar appears for the video and it shows as if the the video has already been played.  Sliding this back to the start and pressing play will display the video, but it appears in the centre of the screen and too small to see the content.  If you right click the tiny video and click on full-screen, it will play normally. \nThe old webm videos made with ffmpeg work fine in the same version of Firefox so it appears that the files created by avconv are different in some way. Perhaps they do not correctly report their dimensions for some reason?  \nI will try to fiddle around over the weekend and report back.\nRegards,\nSteve\n\nA: I'm having the same experience, though I note that the WEBM files I'm getting are using VP8, \nnot VP9. \nHere's the command line I am using on both an Ubuntu 12.04 and a 14.04 system:\navconv -threads auto -strict experimental -i /tmp/c5858937cc47b4c237e1a6ba0b8ba01220140627-2490-1vwkdcr -y -vcodec libvpx -b 250k -maxrate 250k -bufsize 500k -pix_fmt yuv420p -flags +mv4+aic -threads auto -b:a 128k -strict -2 -s 640x360 /tmp/c5858937cc47b4c237e1a6ba0b8ba01220140627-2490-1vwkdcr20140627-2490-ufj5hv.webm\n\nThere are no error messages on either system. \n\n\n*\n\n*On the 12.04 system, the webm video behaves as expected - intial frame of the video shows up in the embedded player, video plays just fine.\n\n*If I open the file in VLC, it plays just fine.\n\n*On a 14.04 server using the version of avconv that comes with it, If I embed the file in a web page, the video appears black.

My main user is UID=1001, but when I create files on a mounted drive, they end up with ownership of UID-1000...  Other users on this machine don't have the issue.\nHow might I fix this?\n\nA: This is probably part of the mount command you used or the fstab entry you created for that particular mount.\nIf you followed a wiki page you may have created a line in file /etc/fstab that looks like:\n//servername/sharename  /media/windowsshare  cifs  guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8  0  0\n\nReplace uid=1000 with uid=1001 and you will be fine.\nEdit\nIf you have another user with UID 1000 then he/she will end up having exactly the same problem.

Today i had to take my laptop to work, so closed the lid and put it in my bag. However, it never went into suspend mode! I tried several times, even rebooting. Finally I tried the previous kernel from the grub menu (reverting back to the -24 one) and suspend works the same as it always had before.\nDid something suspend related change between the -24 and -27 kernels used in Ubuntu 14.04?

Assuming you are currently running 3.13.0, you can just do rm /boot/*-3.0.0-12-generic\n\nA: you could use the following bash script (run as sudo).\nit purges/removes all 'old' kernels.\n#/bin/bash \nls /boot/ | grep vmlinuz | sed 's@vmlinuz-@linux-image-@g' | grep -v `uname -r` > /tmp/kernelList \nfor I in `cat /tmp/kernelList`\ndo \n  #sudo aptitude remove $I \n  sudo apt-get purge --assume-yes $I\n  #echo $I\ndone\nrm -f /tmp/kernelList \nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: Since your dpkg listing does not indicate that the packages for the old kernels exist, feel free to just delete the old unwanted files from /boot.   Then take a look at /lib/modules, and remove the old module directories there too.  Certainly the 3.0.0-12, 16, and 17 may be delete this way, leaving you with enough room for the new kernel.\n", "Q: Xubuntu Alt+Tab behavior I'm using Xubuntu 14.04 and I want to change the Alt+Tab behavior. In Xubuntu, it just has the option to alternate between applications, but I prefer something like Gnome Shell or Unity, that have the Alt+` to change between windows of the same instance. This is possible?\n\nA: I found that option among commands that you can assign the shortcut to in Window Manager Settings via Whisker menu → Window Manager → Keyboard → Switching between windows of the same program. (Translation mine, so official one may vary.)\nIn my case it's Super+Tab, but I think it was empty by default.    \n", "Q: Broadcom Wireless Issues in Lubuntu 14.04 I recently installed Lubuntu 14.04 on my parents' old laptop, and I've been having a super difficult time getting the Broadcom card up and running.

Try the firmware-b43legacy-installer package to see if that gets you the correct firmware (ucode4.fw) and puts it into /lib/firmware/b43legacy.  It looks like you are pulling in the correct driver, it just doesn't have the correct firmware.\n", "Q: Bash script not adding variables to session I have a bash script that I have added as a startup application.

Also could anyone suggest a better way to have these env variables/aliases added to every terminal session?\n\nA: In your .bashrc reference your custom startup script using . setup.sh instead of ./setup.sh. That will cause it to be executed in the context of the current session instead of being executed as a separate program with its own context.\n", "Q: Malformed file warning on boot About 1/3 of the time that I boot my laptop, I get an error message that says\nError: Malformed file.\nPress any key to continue...\n\nI press a key, and then my computer boots up and I can't discern any negative effects.\nIt's kind of disconcerting, and does delay the boot process.\nHow do I resolve this error and ensure my system is stable?\n\nA: It is a bug in Grub, see Launchpad bug #1311247 - error: malformed file, press any key to continue. The upstream bug report is at bug #42134: loadenv.c – check_blocklists – algorithm for block overlap check is wrong.

It's obvious that one have to add the DISPLAY=:0.0 statement, but it's absolutely NOT obvious to add the xauthority file, moreover, it doesn't work anyaway.\n\n\nIf rhythmbox starts, then there are two possibilities:\n 1. It runs in an own instance, so rhythmbox-client doesn't see it.\n 2. It runs in an encapsulated instance of lightdm/unity, so the Hotkeys on the keyboard are not working and, if closed, the music plays on, but one have to kill it with killall rhythmbox because, starting Rhythmbox via unity in any way (quick-access in audio-panel too), creates a second instance.\nI'm only guessing now, but I think, the last two points happens because crontab is doing his work not really in the name of the user it is set up.\nAny help would be very appreciated.\nEdit 2014-06-16:\nTo bring up more info: It seems like, that it isn't even possible to start any graphical interface in 14.04:\n11 8 * * * gnome-terminal\n11 8 * * * DISPLAY=:0.0 gnome-terminal\n\nNone of the above is working. I'm pretty sure in 13.04 and 13.10 this worked... So still investigating...\n\nA: rhythmbox-client requires dbus to communicate with rhythmbox. You need to set the environment variable DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS for rhythmbox-client. The value can be obtained from the environment with a script like this one.\ntouch $HOME/Xdbus\nchmod 600 $HOME/Xdbus\nenv | grep DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS > $HOME/Xdbus\necho 'export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS' >> $HOME/Xdbus\n\nRun this script after you log in. Then in your alert.sh script you could source $HOME/Xdbus before you run rhythmbox-client.\n\nA: Try exporting variables before launch script:  \n50 6 * *  export XAUTHORITY && export DISPLAY=:0 && /scripts/alert.sh #mo\n...\n\nremeber to check wich DISPLAY is connected to the user by typing:\nw\n\n\nA: Now I've chosen a completely different way to solve this problem:\nThe script now waits with a fifo-file until a command from crontab approaches and then start to work. Because of that I'm possible to start the script on startup and get it worked when crontab says to do so. Now the display manager starts the script and not crontab which now looks like: \n#start alert\n50 8 * * 1 echo \"start;`whoami`;'`date`'\" > /scripts/alert/com_fifo #mo\n30 7 * * 2 echo \"start;`whoami`;'`date`'\" > /scripts/alert/com_fifo #di\n...\n\nI'm sorry but posting of the script is hardly possible, because it got split up in multiple files to be able to reuse some functions. Basically it looks like this:\nhellNotFrozen=true\ncom=\"/scripts/alert/com_fifo\"\n\n#clear fifo file\nrm $com >/dev/null 2>&1 \nmkfifo $com\n\nwhile [[ $hellNotFrozen ]]; do\n\n    #read fifo-file - this statement is blocking!\n    inp=`cat $com` #$inp now holds the text pasted into the com-file\n\n    #...do other stuff here        \n    rhythmbox-client --enqueue \"/data/Music/$chosenFolder/*\"\n    rhythmbox-client --play\n\ndone\n\nThanks for all of your answers.\n", "Q: MySQL not working after server reboot?

Among other things it says: \n\nOnly the -generic x86 kernel flavor ... will be supported...\n\nAlso, this answer says:\n\n...This is only recommended for x86 hardware installations...\n\nIs x86 here synonymous to 32-bit/i386 architecture (but not 64-bit/AMD64), or is it i386/AMD64 (but not ARM)?\nCan I install this \"hardware enablement stack\" in a 64-bit/AMD64 Ubuntu? Will it be supported with future updates?\n\nA: Yes, x86 means amd64 or i386. The reference only the -generic kernel flavor refers to the various kernel packages available; \"generic\" is the regular kernel, but there are also kernels optimised for virtual machines and low latency, and those other kernels are not supported by the hardware enablement stack. \n", "Q: Can't change the access time of a file i cant change the access time of any file i create.\ni tried the touch -a, touch -ad, touch -t commands, but the access time in the stat utility stays the same.\nCan you please help me to modify the access time of the file, and the change time [if possible].\nThank You.\n\nA: Ubuntu, depending when/how you installed it, uses relatime or noatime mount options by default - this means that tracking of access times is basically disabled.\nYou can change it by removing that option from /etc/fstab and rebooting. Or, for instance\nsudo mount -o remount,atime /home\n\non the relevant filesystem.\n", "Q: Can the mount command mount iso files into virtual drives?

I get the output /media/minow/VDVD: Is a directory ...it's like I wanna tell the terminal \"YEAH I KNOW!\"\nso anyways :D is there something wrong with my command or is it impossible to do this in the first place?\n\nA: Alternately, you can install gcdemu to get something of a gui to mount isos and bin/cue pairs.\n\nA: You should do it the other way around, first specify the file and then the folder where you want to mount it.\n", "Q: after Ubuntu 14.04 update Geforce doesn't work anymore After I have updated yesterday Ubuntu 14.04 in a routine update my NVIDIA Gforce doesn't work anymore.

You can use it to authenticate yourself too.\n", "Q: PPA without upgrades I just installed smartgithg via ppa:eugenesan/ppa. After an upgrade and restart the whole window style got broken and I can't switch to my preferred keyboard layout.

The system is now working again. I'm wondering why smartgithg is still installed. Anyways I won't get updates for it..\nRegards\n\nA: Since smartgithg is not in the Ubuntu repositories, something like this in /etc/apt/preferences should do (untested, however) :\nPackage: *\nPin: origin \"XX.archive.ubuntu.com\"\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nPackage: *\nPin: origin \"security.ubuntu.com\"\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nYou are giving priority >= 1000 to all packages from the Ubuntu repos (change according to your archive mirror, of course). This means that Apt will always prefer packages from the repos, even if the version is lower than packages available from other sources (in your case, the PPA).\n", "Q: Does the Ubuntu upload oops to kernelopps.org?

Ubuntu uses Whoopsie/Apport to intercept these crashes but sends them to https://daisy.ubuntu.com.\nDoes Whoopsie/Apport send these oops to http://kerneloops.org as well?\nHow can I configure it to do so?\n\nA: There is a kerneloops daemon and that one sends crash reports to kerneloops.org (see the kerneloops-daemon package ) so there should be no need for Whoopsie to send those to kerneloops (analysis could be an exception). \nIf that deamon is active crash reports will be sent to kerneloops.org \n", "Q: How can I enable syntax highlighting in a Python file without an extension? Turning on syntax highlighting in Nano is simple enough but I've just run into a non-standard issue. I have an executable Python script that doesn't have an extension. \nIt's part of a virtualenv environment so here's how it starts:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\n\nA: You can select a specific syntax highlighting using the --syntax option, for example\nnano --syntax=python myscript\n\n\nA: Nano's default Python definition looks for one of two things an extension or a header match, as defined in /usr/share/nano/python.nanorc:\nsyntax \"python\" \"\\.py$\"\nheader \"^#!.*/python[-0-9._]*\"\n\nSo this would match #!/bin/python. Unless you're writing something for the system, hard-coding the Python executable is a fairly bad idea... That's why env python is used these days.\nThe most simple way to fix Nano is to edit the definition by running sudoedit /usr/share/nano/python.nanorc and changing the header line to:\nheader \"^#!.*python.*\"\n\nThat is a lot more open.\n\nThere's actually a massively improved set of Syntax files available at the nanorc project on Github, that as well as improving other things, specifies:\nheader \"^#!.*/(env +)?python[-0-9._]*( |$)\"\n\nIt's no longer maintained but it's still a massive improvement over the defaults.

I want to make my own Debian package, which contains some default config file. I don't want this file to be rewritten after update with dpkg -i.\nWhat are the ways to solve my problem?\n\nA: You can create a file called debian/conffiles and list the files in it. This will cause dpkg to check the file for changes before overwriting it. From Debian Policy:\n\nFor each file it checks to see whether the version of the file\n  included in the package is the same as the one that was included in\n  the last version of the package (the one that is being upgraded from);\n  it also compares the version currently installed on the system with\n  the one shipped with the last version.\nIf neither the user nor the package maintainer has changed the file,\n  it is left alone. If one or the other has changed their version, then\n  the changed version is preferred - i.e., if the user edits their file,\n  but the package maintainer doesn't ship a different version, the\n  user's changes will stay, silently, but if the maintainer ships a new\n  version and the user hasn't edited it the new version will be\n  installed (with an informative message). If both have changed their\n  version the user is prompted about the problem and must resolve the\n  differences themselves.\n\nIf you really never want dpkg to touch the file again, another approach is to just create the file in the postinst script on first install and don't do anything on upgrades. Just remember to also create a corresponding postrm script that will delete the file on purge.\n", "Q: How to keep specific old kernel on my next kernel upgrade?

This command:\nA=10 echo $A\n\nprints an empty line. Why not 10? Why doesn't the in-place temporary environment setting work?\nI want to know the reason and explanation rather than solution.\nI used\nLANG=C gcc ...\n\nto force gcc use the fallback language (English) instead of the system language (Chinese). So I assume a VAR=value prefix will setup a temporary environment for the command following it. But it looks like I have some misunderstanding.\n\nA: When you use LANG=C gcc ...  what happens is that the shell sets LANG for gcc's environment only, and not for the current environment itself (see note). So after gccfinishes, LANG is back to its previous value (or unset).\nAdditionally, when you use A=10 echo $A it is the shell that replaces $A, not echo, and this substitution (called \"expansion\") happens before the statement is evaluated (including the assignment), so to work as expected A's value must be already set in the current environment prior to that statement.\nThat's why A=10 echo $A does not work as expected: A=10 will be set for echo, but echo internally ignores the value of the environment variable A. And $A is replaced with the value set in the current shell (which is none), and then passed as an argument to echo.\nSo your assumption is correct: VAR=value command does work, but this is only relevant if command internally uses VAR. If not, you can still pass value as an argument to command, but arguments are replaced by the current shell, so they must be set prior to usage: VAR=value; command \"$VAR\"\nIf you know how to create an executable script, you can try this as a test:\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"1st argument is $1\"\necho \"A is $A\"\n\nSave it as testscript and try:\n$ A=5; A=10 testscript \"$A\"; echo \"$A\"\n1st argument is 5\nA is 10\n5\n\nLast but not least, it's worth knowing the difference between shell and environment variables and program arguments. \nHere are some good references:\n\n\n*\n\n*How To Read and Set Environmental and Shell Variables on a Linux VPS\n\n*Understanding Unix shells and environment variables\n.\n(*) Note: technically the shell does set in current environment too, and here's why: Some commands, like echo, read and test are shell builtins, and as such they don't spawn a child process. They run in current environment. But the shell takes care for the assignment only lasts until the command is running, so for all practical purposes the effect is the same: the assignment is only seen by that single command.\n\nA: One possibly clean way to do what you apparently desire is to issue the command:\nA=10 eval 'echo $A'\n\nWhich will in effect defer the substitution of the value 10 into the place of $A to a later context (ie, 'inside' the eval, which already knows about the assignment). Note that the single quotes are essential. Such a construct cleanly communicates the assignment to your desired command (echo in this case) without running the risk of polluting your current environment.\n\nA: It's a matter of the order in which the different steps of evaluating a command happen.\nA=10 echo $A first parses the command into a simple command made of three words A=10, echo and $A. Then each word undergoes variable substitution, i.e. the transformation of variable expansions such as $A into their values (I'm omitting steps that do nothing visible).\nIf A has the value foo initially, the result of the expansion steps is a simple command which still has three words: A=10, echo and foo. (The shell also remembers at this point which characters were initially within quotes — in this case, none.) The next step is to execute the command. Since A=10 begins with a valid variable name followed by an equal sign, it is treated as an assignment; the variable A is set to 10 in both the shell and the environment during the execution of the command. (Normally you need to write export A to have A in the environment and not just as a shell variable; this is an exception.) The next word is not an assignment, so it's treated as a command name (it's a built-in command). The echo command does not depend on any variable, so A=10 echo $A has exactly the same effect as echo $A.\nIf you want to set a variable for the duration of a command only, but taking the assignment into account while executing the command, you can use a subshell. A subshell, indicated by parentheses, makes all state changes (variable assignments, current directory, function definitions, etc.) local to the subshell.\n(A=10; echo $A)\n\nMake that export A=10 if you want to export the variable to the environment so that it is seen by external programs.\n", "Q: Why won't Ubuntu tweak delete my Thumbnail Cache?

Why does this happen and how to delete it? By the way I could delete every other thumbnail cache file and also other kind of cache except this 'fail' file.

Since neither C nor X is a valid language code, GNU compatible applications fall back to the original language, i.e. English.\nLANGUAGE=en application\n\nwould be correct if LANGUAGE in the session environment is set to some other language, and you want to start a particular application in English.\nTo start non-GNU compatible applications in English you can use\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8 application\n\n\nA: KDE 4:\nKDE_LANG=de myapp\n\nKDE Frameworks 5:\nLANGUAGE=de myapp\n\nSee http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Localization/Building_KDE%27s_l10n_Module\nStep 2: Test An Application\n", "Q: How do I make new Nautilus windows show the same folder as the original window?

Is this possible? Please can I have an answer from someone who has done this so I know it will work.\n\nA: It is not impossible, but since you are new to Linux, it is very unlikely that you could get it to work satisfactorily. Surface 2 is an ARM system that requires a signed bootloader. To install Ubuntu, you would have to jailbreak the Surface 2, then build your own ARM image of Ubuntu (Ubuntu does not ship images for ARM hardware) and then install it. And then you will have to deal with the numerous driver incompatibilities you will run into. \nThe Surface Pro, on the other hand, is an x86 tablet, and the boot loader isn't locked down, so an install is a much easier prospect. See Linux users rejoice, here’s Ubuntu on the Surface Pro 3\n\nA: Assuming that you are talking about a surface 2 (which is an Arm system using a Tegra processor from Nvidia) the answer is no. Even if you jail broke the system I do not believe that Ubuntu has UEFI keys for the Arm processors.\nIf you are talking about the Surface 2 Pro which is an Intel processor then, yes you can run Ubuntu on it and there are numerous how-to articles on the web.

The AMD support website \"http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Linux%20x86_64#amd-catalyst-packages\" shows 2 drivers - their beta driver and the catalyst 14.4 and both show my Radeon HD 7600M series as being supported in the release notes. But when i tried installing either , i am getting an error that my graphics card is not supported.\nI even tried the driver i was earlier running on in ubuntu 13.04, but that too is now giving the same error.\nFinally i installed a proprietary driver found under Additional Hardware and selected the Intel graphics card under switchable graphics in the catalyst centre. My current laptop temperature is around 61 C and even slightest computations are taking the temp to as high as 72 C . \nI donot care about performance - all i care is somehow to reduce my laptop temperature - anyhow - even i tried switching the AMD card off using vgaswitcheroo , but i found that since kernel 3.12 there is dynamic power management and no way to switch the card completely off.\nThe output of my \nlspci | grep VGA\n\nis as follows now \n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

It's a DAW (digital audio workstation) and will therefore be able to do much more than you probably need, but if you want to produce audio in a really professional quality, knowing how to work with Ardour will make your life much easier.\nFor your use case, it is as simple as recording on a new track in Ardour and then dropping one of the reverb/delay plugins in there and tweaking the parameters.\n\nA: sox is a command-line tool that does this.

That is largely the answer, but how its decided that a page is inactive and should be moved to swap? It depends on the page replacement algorithms being used.\nMostly demand paging is used.\nNothing gets loaded to swap directly from the hard disk. On the hard disk pages do not exist; pages exist only when a program is loaded in memory, and it's from there they get transferred (swapped) to swap space and that's done according to paging algorithms.\n", "Q: problem in installing amd driver radeon hd 5460 I tried to install my gpu in Ubuntu 12.04 with this link \nWhat is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD?\nbut when I type this command line: \n\n$sudo aticonfig --initial\n\nI got this err:\n\naticonfig: No supported adapters detected\n\nwhat should I must to do?\nany suggestion about this?\nI use Ubuntu 12.04 and hp pavilion dm4-1060ea note book and ati radeon hd5460\nI used this command to find out the model of my gpu card:\n$lspci | grep VGA\nand showed me these:\n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor\n  Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee\n  ATI Manhattan [Mobility Radeon HD 5400 Series]\n\nThanks\nHamid\n\nA: I tried several times to do this for my wifes computer, with little success and eventually gave up!\nLooking at the AMD site for the current driver, released 5/22, there are many packages that you should ensure are installed on your system to make this work:\ngimp-help-en\ngimp-help-common\nXFree86-Mesa-libGL\nlibstdc++\nlibgcc\nXFree86-libs\nfontconfig\nfreetype\nzlib\ngcc\nXorg/Xserver 7.4 and above (up to 1.14)\nLinux kernel 2.6 or above (up to 3.11)\nglibc version 2.2 or 2.3\nPOSIX Shared Memory (/dev/shm) support is required for 3D applications\n\nMost of these should be on your system already, but you should check.\nRead through the driver preliminary documentation at http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMDCatalyst14-4LINReleaseNotes.aspx, and perhaps consider downloading the latest version of the drivers at http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Linux+x86#amd-catalyst-packages.\n", "Q: debuild failed at dh_install with cp: cannot stat `debian/tmp//path/to/install/bin/': No such file or directory I am creating a binary package for local usage by reading http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/1313226#1313226 chat session.

Why is using symbolic links to change the default python version on Ubuntu considered as being unsafe ?\nI read this information on several forums but did not find an answer as to why is this so.\n\nA: In most systems, python refers to python2 and python3 refers to python3.\nThe reason a symbolic link created with python to refer to python3 is considered unsafe is because this will cause applications that used python to refer to python2  to crash or misbehave. This is mainly because python3 is not backward compatible with python2; they are very much different in syntax as well as semantics.\nYou should rather use aliases as a better alternative to use python to refer to python3.\nsymbolic links in general are not bad, it depends how you use them.\n\nA: It's not good to change the default python , because many programs use python 2 rather than python 3.

Trouble is, if I use the command:\neog -s --display=DVI-0 image.jpg\n\nit states it cannot open the display (my assumption is that it is referring to X-displays). Is there a way to have one instance open on each screen?\n\nA: There is two problems here:\n\n\n*\n\n*having two separate instances (or at least windows) of eog\n\n*controlling on which screen they open\n\n\nThe first one is simple : option --new-instance do the trick.\nThe scond one is more complicated. The --display argument refers to the X server to use, not the name of the screen and/or monitor (xorg.conf terminology). So --display is not the right think to use.\nWhen issuing eog --fullscreen image.jpg on a terminal, the image open on the same screen than the terminal. So I suppose there is a way to tell Gtk to opens on a precise screen. (NB: option -s is for slideshow, i;e. if you want one single image, prefer fullscreen.)\nFrom the documentation of GTK/Gdk, and the source code of eog, It seems that eog create a popup with teh image, and request gdk to set it fullscreen. Gdk then requests the window manager to set the \"window\" of the popup fullscreen. So the decision to open the image on this or that screen belongs to the window manager.\nwmctrl seem to be the right tool to communicate with the window manager. Here is a draft of a script doing that.\n#!/bin/bash\n#open two fullscreen windows\neog --fullscreen --new-instance image1.jpg&\n#wait until windows are actually created\nwhile [ 1 ]; do \n   found=$(wmctrl -l |grep 'image1.jpg'); \n   if ! [[ -z \"$found\" ]]; then \n      break; \n   fi; \ndone;\n#move first win to the left\nwmctrl -r 'image1.jpg' -e 1,0,0,-1,-1\n\neog --fullscreen --new-instance image2.jpg&\n#wait\nwhile [ 1 ]; do \n   found=$(wmctrl -l |grep 'image2.jpg'); \n   if ! [[ -z \"$found\" ]]; then \n      break; \n   fi; \ndone;\n#move\nwmctrl -r 'image2.jpg' -e 1,1280,0,-1,-1\n\nBut you should replace 1280 with your actual screen width.

The only thing I've found is people saying to manually downgrade each package with apt-get, and there were a reasonable number of packages installed.\nUbuntu Version:\nUbuntu 12.04.4 LTS\nI installed the updates last night.\n\nNew things I've tried:\nI tried it again as my own user id (datahead). I had thought it got rid of the xauthority error, but trying it again now, I see it is getting a slightly different X Authority error.  It still fails to connect to the X Server, too.\nI tried apt-get purge nvidia* (which wiped out a whole lot of nivida packages) and then did apt-get install nvidia-current.

I found my laptop was overheating a couple times.  I'm guessing I should turn it off if I'm in Ubuntu (command line only) and need to move it, rather than letting it try and go in idle mode.\n\nA: \nxauth: file /root/Xauthority does not exist\n\nPlease do not try to startx with root. Xauthhority is a file in the /home/$USER/ directory and is (and must be) owned by the user. sudo su && startx and sudo startx are very different things: the 1st uses user root and the 2nd the currently logged in user. The 2nd is the correct one. If needed remove the Xauthority in /home/$USER (that will be recreated on next logon). That solves this error. \n\nFATAL: Module nvidia not found\n\nInstall both packages nvidia-current and nvidia-utils. This one has more details: Nvidia drivers installed, but not used (also take note of the alternatives method). \nThe other errors:\nFatal server error: no screens found\n\nand\nxinit: giving up\nxinit: unable to connect to X server: No such file or directory\nxinit: server error\n\nshould be related to the nvidia module not being available.\n", "Q: Can I run both Ubuntu and Windows? I'm about to take computer science classes in college. Will I be needing Windows for some courses? I want to remove Windows and install Ubuntu but I might need it for school. Should I just have them both? Or can I install Windows (7 or 8) again after replacing it with Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you intend to use windows for a short period of time, it would be better to use it as a virtual machine on ubuntu. You won't lose your present data and can also easily \"throw away\" the virtual machine after use.\nTo create a virtual machine, you would need a hypervisor that supports running on linux-based distributions and running windows as guest systems (operating system on virtual machines).\nVMware Player is one such software you could use for free. There are others such as virtual machine manager and VirtualBox too.\nIf you are going to use VMware Player on ubuntu 14.04 you may have to patch it to be compatible with kernel 3.13. This blog may be helpful for this purpose.\n\nA: Ubuntu (Linux) is an operating system - Windows is another operating system... they both do the same type of work on your computer, so you can't really run both a once.\nHowever, it's possible to set-up your computer to run \"dual-boot\".  You make room for Windows on your disk (a new partition) and install Windows besides Ubuntu.  At boot-time, you can choose between running Ubuntu or Windows.\nAnother option, is to install Wine on Ubuntu, this allows you to run Windows-programs under Ubuntu.  It doesn't work for all programs, but then again for many it does.\nYour final - and perhaps easiest option (if you have plenty of disk, plenty of RAM and a rather fast computer) - is to use virtuallization and install Windows in a \"virtual computer\" \"inside\" Ubuntu.  VirtualBox and Qemu are examples of virtualization-solutions - personally I'll probably recomend VirtualBox.  \nYou start VirtualBox under Ubuntu and set-up a \"virtual computer\" for Windows, by deciding things like how much RAM (you'll be \"using-up\" the RAM in your actual computer) and how big \"disk\" (really a file you store under Ubuntu) you need.  Then you \"boot\" your virtual-computer, and install Windows on it (from a CD) as you'd do if you installed Windows on a \"real\" machine.  Your Windows-installation will then run in a window inside Ubuntu (although you can make it full-screen, thus \"obscuring\" Ubuntu below).\n\nA: Many colleges use login systems that do not support linux. You might want to research what sort of system your school uses.\nYou could always either.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ubuntu in a windows vm (like virtualbox)\n\n*Resize your windows partition with the ubuntu live usb/dvd, install ubuntu to the empty space and dual boot.\n\n\nA: I don't know will you need it. Better to do dual-boot. Boot from Live-CD and repartition the hard drive (shrink Windows' partition and in the left space make new, ext4 one). Choose the new (ext4) partition for installing. GRUB will automatically configure for choosing between M$ Windows and Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can not install Windows on Uubntu, but you can install Ubuntu and Windows in a dual-boot environment which allows you to choose between Ubuntu or Windows.\nYou also can choose either OS as a primary OS and run the other OS in a virtual environment. I personally use VirtualBox, but VMware or KVM can work as well. In my personal case I use Ubuntu as my 'host' OS and run Windows 7 and 8 in VirtualBox.\nThe dual boot solution will only allow you to run one OS at a time. VirtualBox will allow you to run more than one. I have had Ubuntu (host), Windows 7 (guest), Windows 8 (guest), and Windows 2012R2 (guest) running all at the same time. Virtual machines may have issues with directX components working properly.\n", "Q: How to save customized Kde desktop for all desktop Guys I love to customize my Kubuntu Desktop and on my home computer I did something with Homerun and a custom Desktop Theme but whenever I create a new User account that simple KDE desktop comes back so how can I apply my customizations to all accounts without starting from scratch on every account.\n\nA: Kubuntu defaults / kde4rc\nThe default configuration profile path is read from the /etc/kde4rc.

That could have easily been done if you clicked one of the drive icons from the desktop to check to see what was on the drives.\nUnmount those drives by rick clicking on them and choosing \"Unmount\".\n\nA: That key icon indicates that the partition you are trying to modify is currently under use. In order to modify that/those partition/s you have to boot up from a live CD. Then you will be able to modify those partitions. But, be sure to backup your data as it can lead to data loss.

But it don't works with linux. \nThere a way that can I make this moving? \nThanks!\n\nA: First, copy the contents of C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Thunderbird\\Profiles on your Windows 7 machine to your Linux machine. Make sure you get atleast one folder with a name consisting of a random string of characters and then a name - e.g. x90j7qn5.Default User\nThen create a directory called ~/.thunderbird, and copy the files into it, and note down the name of the file. Then run thunderbird -profilemanager to open this:\n                                       \n \nClick Create Profile..., and pick the location of the file you just copied to ~/thunderbird (e.g. /home/YOUR_USERNAME/thunderbird/x90j7qn5.Default User)\nThough apparently this should work cross-platform, I think you may need the same or similar versions of Thunderbird for this to work properly.\nSource: http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/diy-it-guy/diy-back-up-and-migrate-a-thunderbird-profile-and-folders/\n", "Q: Can someone help me remove/fix ubuntu? I'm very new to ubuntu for starters. Whenever I turn my computer on, it opens to the GNU Grub terminal. It says it supports minimal Bash-Like line editing (I have no idea what this means). To work-around this, I used \"exit -ubuntu\", this then takes me to a separate page which I selected the Windows Boot Manager and click on the Windows 8.1 icon which makes my Windows 8 load normally.\nIf I click on the other icon, being the ubuntu one, I get put back at the GNU Grub terminal and thats it. If someone could help me either remove ubuntu or repair it so that I can load it again, I would appreciate it. I had installed the most recent ubuntu version. \n\nA: Try using instructions from here to install Ubuntu.

How do I correct this issue and get all 32gbs back?\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu, you can try the \"Disk Utility\".  If that fails, it may be because the USB has been partitioned incorrectly.  If that is true, then you should use \"GParted\" to re-partition and format.  You should format your USB to Fat32 to be compatible with most other operating systems, but that is your choice to decide.\nGParted is available through the Ubuntu Software Center, if not already installed and Disk Utility should have been installed with your Ubuntu Package.\nYou may already know this, but, you need to use caution when using GParted, or you could damage your HDD if you select the wrong drive.

I know there are multiple headers of the same type here, but they are different versions.  Version \"linux-headers-3.14.4-031404\" shows to be the latest.\nUbuntu shows \"Nothing needed to be installed.\"\nHowever, the following C/C++ headers files show to be missing for Eclipse and QT4.\n#include <linux/version.h>\n#include <linux/module.h>\n#include <linux/socket.h>\n#include <linux/miscdevice.h>\n#include <linux/list.h>\n#include <linux/vmalloc.h>\n#include <linux/slab.h>\n#include <linux/init.h>\n#include <asm/uaccess.h>\n#include <asm/atomic.h>\n#include <linux/delay.h>\n#include <linux/usb.h>\n\nThis problem appears on my 32-bit version of Ubuntu and on both of my 64-bit versions.\nWhat I am doing wrong?\n\nA: It looks like you are trying to compile a project that uses header files from the Linux kernel, either a kernel driver or some other project that uses Linux kernel data structures and APIs. Kernel development is a very specific use case that is not covered by the build-essential  package, so it is no surprise that installing build-essential is not automatically making these header files available to you.\nTo install these header files, you will want to make sure that the linux-headers-generic  package is installed. This will install the header files corresponding to the current version of the kernel provided by the Ubuntu repositories.\nEven after they are properly installed, these header files are not installed in the default system include path (in the /usr/include directory) because they are not intended to be included by host libraries and applications. Instead they are installed in a versioned directory specific to each installed copy of the kernel.\nThe canonical way to locate Linux kernel header files once they are installed for your kernel version is to look in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include, where $(uname -r) is a shell substitution for the current kernel version:\n$ ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/\n\nOnce you have ensured that the header files package is installed, you will have to point your build system to the Linux kernel include path. If you are working with a Makefile-based or Automake project, this could be done with a CPPFLAGS variable in the project's Makefile:\nCPPFLAGS = -I/lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build/include\n\nNow, if you are building a Linux kernel module there are specific ways to set up your project Makefile to integrate with the Linux kernel build system, see for example\n\n\n*\n\n*The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide\n\n*Makefile for Linux kernel module?\n", "Q: Can the C++ API be used to develop scopes for Unity 7?

To get a Ubuntu version that is sized below 700 Mb, you must try Ubuntu 10.04.04 (Lucid Lynx).\nBetter you pay a few bucks more and get the latest Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) on a DVD.\n\nA: You can find Ubuntu 10.10 (Oneiric) here : http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/oneiric/\nAfter having it installed, open the file /etc/apt/source.list as root, delete its content and enter the following :\ndeb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric main restricted universe multiverse\n#deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric main restricted universe multiverse\n\ndeb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-updates main restricted universe multiverse\n#deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-updates main restricted universe multiverse\n\ndeb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-security main restricted universe multiverse\n#deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-security main restricted universe multiverse\n\ndeb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-backports main restricted universe multiverse\n#deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-backports main restricted universe multiverse\n\ndeb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-proposed main restricted universe multiverse\n#deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-proposed main restricted universe multiverse\n\nSave it.\nYou will now be able to get the latest Oneiric update with the sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade command, or upgrade to the current LTS version (12.04 and 14.04) with the sudo apt-get update && sudo do-release-upgrade command.\nOneiric is not maintained anymore, use it at your own risk.\n", "Q: Running League of Legends on Samsung Chromebook with Ubuntu 12.04.4 ARM I purchased this Samsung chromebook and installed xfce along with ubuntu 12.04.4. I am completely new to everything linux, and I realize that using \"playonlinux\" league of legends is able to be played on most linux machines, but since i am unable to install wine on this ARM chromebook, I am wondering if there is anyway i can play my favorite online game on my new netbook.\n\nA: TL;DR\nIf you have a program compiled for x86 you'll need an emulator to run it on ARM. In its current development state Wine has no such (working) emulator, therefore you can't do what you want.\n\nAbout wine:\n\nWine (originally an acronym for \"Wine Is Not an Emulator\") is a\n  compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several\n  POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, Mac OSX, & BSD.\n  Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or\n  emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls\n  on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other\n  methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications\n  into your desktop.\n\nAbout emulation:\n\nWhen users think of emulators, they think of programs like Dosbox or\n  zsnes. These applications run as virtual machines and are slow, having\n  to emulate each processor instruction. Wine does not do any CPU\n  emulation - hence the name \"Wine Is Not an Emulator.\"\n\nWine on non x86 processors:\n\nWell, it is true that Wine only runs on x86 processors. Unfortunately\n  it will also require quite a lot of work before it runs on other\n  processor architectures.\n...\nThen there's what everyone has been waiting for: 'I want to be able to\n  run my x86 Windows applications on any processor architecture I like.'\n  That's the most complex one. Again the prerequisite is that Winelib\n  works on this architecture, which will definitely happen someday. Then\n  'all that is needed' is to integrate an x86 emulator with Wine (and\n  also change Wine's name :-). Ulrich Weigand just did that as an\n  experiment some time ago when he had 'some spare time'. He even\n  managed to get some Win16 applications to run. His code was not in a\n  state where it could be integrated into Wine yet and I don't know how\n  much work has been put into pursuing it. His attempt did spark many\n  discussions on Wine's mailing list though. The result is that we would\n  need a sophisticated emulator including a JIT in order to get\n  something really viable (i.e. not too slow). And developing such an\n  emulator is a whole project in itself.\n\n", "Q: Auth succeeded No requires line available Upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 (and Apache2 2.4) server I can't use MySQL as htaccess;\nBefore upgrading I was using MySQL as htaccess in the virtual host - worked nicely:\n<Directory /var/www/html/tilmelding/login>\n           AuthBasicAuthoritative Off\n            AuthUserFile /dev/null\n\n            # begin auth_mysql configuration\n            AuthMySQL On\n            AuthMySQL_Host localhost\n            AuthMySQL_User **********\n            AuthMySQL_Password *********\n            AuthMySQL_DB **********\n            AuthMySQL_Password_Table user_info\n            AuthMySQL_Username_Field user_name\n            AuthMySQL_Password_Field user_passwd\n            AuthMySQL_Empty_Passwords Off\n            AuthMySQL_Encryption_Types PHP_MD5\n            AuthMySQL_Authoritative \n            AuthType Basic\n            AuthName \"auth_mysql test\"\n            Require valid-user\n\n \nAfter upgrade it didn’t work. \nIn the logfile I got:\n\n[:debug] [pid 31333] mod_auth_mysql.c(1578): Constructing password collection query with passfield=[user_passwd], table=[user_info], userfield=[helgoland], where_clause=[]\n[:debug] [pid 31333] mod_auth_mysql.c(1410): sec->dbh in /var/www/html/tilmelding/login/ is \n[:debug] [pid 31333] mod_auth_mysql.c(1417): Ordinary query\n[:debug] [pid 31333] mod_auth_mysql.c(1434): Running query: [SELECT user_passwd FROM user_info WHERE user_name='helgoland']\n[:debug] [pid 31333] mod_auth_mysql.c(1522): Checking with PHP_MD5\n[:debug] [pid 31333] mod_auth_mysql.c(1524): Auth succeeded\n[:error] [pid 31333] No requires line available\n\nI am able to do the query from CLI and get an MD5 back.\nWhat have I missed ?\n\nA: Just add AuthMySQL_Authoritative Off to .htaccess\n\nA: I've stumbled upon the exact same problem, so I came across this post.\nFor anyone who ends up here, this is my conclusion.\nAfter further searching the net, most people seem to conclude that lib-apache2-mod-auth-mysql is incompatible with Apache 2.4 (standard in Ubuntu 14.04)\nMoreover support for this module has stopped.\nSome suggest recompiling (version 3.0.0) with some patches fixes the problem. But this seems quite \"hacky\".\nThe official \"Apache\" way to use basic authentication/authorization using MySQL is to use the dbd module (mod_authn_dbd). How to do this is explained quite clearly in the official Apache documentation. http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_authn_dbd.html.\nThis documentation is licensed under the Apache License.  http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\nSo be aware that although you could install lib-apache2-mod-auth-mysql with apt-get in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS this is probably best avoided since it is inherently broken for this version.\n\nA: AuthMySQL_Authoritative Off also worked for me (as a line in the Virtualhost config). I believe it allows mod_auth_mysql to pass the credentials on to mod_auth for authentication.\n", "Q: How could Rhythmbox deal with multiple-disc albums Title pretty much says it all. My Rhythmbox confuses the first disc of the Les Miserables soundtrack deluxe edition with the second disc, the effect being that the song titles are all wrong.\nLook at this screenshot:\n\nIt shows 19 tracks, which is the number of tracks in disc two, but track info from disc one. Even the time field is all wrong; when I took this screenshot, Javert's Suicide was still playing though Rhythmbox says that the play time for track 11 is over.\n\nA: Many tagging software such as EasyTag, Picard use a variety of techniques help media players such as Rhythmbox that don't deal with Multi-disc albums very well.\nCommonly they append the disc number to the album title in the format (disc x) where x is the disc number.\nI've grouped some of these in my collection as shown in the following picture.\n\nNow - the easiest way to do this is using Rhythmbox itself if its one of the common file types such as MP3, OGG.  If you are using something Rhythmbox doesnt allow you to modify (see later) then its best to use software such as EasyTag and Picard to modify the tags in the music files themselves.  Then Rhythmbox will see the modified album titles.\nOne technique I use is to add the file location to the tracks window - use the Preferences option to do this.  Then you can order by file-location to group all the tracks in one file-location.  Typically you would copy all tracks for album-disc 1 in the same location - album-disc2 will be is a separate folder.\nHighlight all the tracks for one album, right-click and select properties\n\nFinally, append the disc number to the album-title as shown and click OK.\n\nAll the album tags for the multiple tracks chosen will be updated.\n\nA: If you change the album title of the Deluxe edition from Les Miserables: Something to Les Miserables: Something (Deluxe), Rhythmbox will separate it out...\nDisc numbers don't seem make much difference, because it does not order the files with them, they are just there for extra info. When rhythmbox displays the list of music, you can order the list view by what it shown (Title, Genre, Artist, Album, etc - you can set this in Rhythmbox's Preferences) by clicking on 'Title' etc at the top of the list (only in the main Music playlist though).\nThis can means for example when you order by Album (or Artist, Genre, etc), the 'Greatest Hits' and 'Best Of' albums all get mixed up. So the easiest solution is to rename.\nYou could File a Bug if you want (there may be one already), as this always has been a long standing problem, though there is not much that could be done about it easily.\n", "Q: forward slash to search in evince removed with upgrade to 14.04 It used to be the case (pre 14.04) that one could search a PDF with the forward slash, then cycle through the results with F3.

So the oxideqt-codecs package would be removed before theoxideqt-codecs-extra package is installed so they do not conflict.\nThe oxideqt-codecs-* packages provide extra codecs for HTML5 <video> and <audio> rendering by the Oxide engine. This can be used by QT applications - which you likely do not need as most major browsers include these plugins or will those provided by gstreamer0.10-plugins* and other packages.\n1) The oxideqt-codecs-extra likely includes what is included in oxideqt-codecs, so there is no need for the oxideqt-codecs package - which is also why the packages conflict.

Additionally, only root can floodping with a zero interval.\nFor example:\nping -fb <BROADCAST ADDRESS>\n\nInstead, you really ought to use NMAP in a friendly way.\nETA: if what you want is a list of node replies, we can get a little more clever:\nping -b -c 2 -i 20 <BROADCAST ADDRESS>\n\nWhere -b permits pinging a broadcast address, -c 2 tells ping to send two pings, -i 20 tells ping to wait twenty seconds between them.\nWhat this gets you is a near-instant list of replies with a twenty-second wait before termination, followed by traffic statistics. The reason to make two ping echo requests is because if you set -c 1, ping will terminate on the very first response that it receives. We set twenty seconds between the two so that the list of replies is somewhat readable. It's a hack, but it works.\nFrom here, you could suppress statistics output by piping to head -n-4 and then do useful awk tricks, sort, uniq and the like to build a useful one-liner report.\n", "Q: No decoder available for type 'audio/x-wma' I'm using Xubuntu 14.04 LTS on my Lenovo R60e.

If, say, Wifi worked fine with the Live version, does this mean that it will work as great later? \n\nA: Using the LiveUSB/CD will not install / make any changes to your system\nThis should give some indication of what will work out of the box - however, there are updates / workarounds (ndiswrapper and other list of workarounds) in place should you need it.\nYou may wish to consider looking at the support for your wireless card and perhaps looking at the manufacturers website you may be able to find out more about your netbook and if there is any compatibility issues\nYou can insert your model here to give you an idea\nAlso, this has been a popular choice to view device setup\nOnce you have a clear list of peripherals, such as wifi etc, you can have a look at existing lists, such as this one\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: There are some differences between a live-cd/live-usb installation and an installation, but in most cases if you have no troubles with the live-cd you should be fine with a native installation. The majority of differences don't affect hardware support like wifi devices, but some potentially could. For further testing purposes you can always install Ubuntu to a usb stick not as a live-usb but as a normal installation. As long as you don't overwrite your Windows boot manager it won't affect Windows. The only way to know for sure if your system will work with Ubuntu is to install it.\nThe Key Differences Between A Live Install And An Install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some software packages present on the live-cd will be removed when you install Ubuntu. This won't affect hardware support as it's not kernel related. For more on that check out this posting: Which Programs Are Included In The LiveCD That Are Removed Upon Installation?\n\n*The live-cd only contains about 3/4 of an Ubuntu installation. If you want to get the rest you must have an internet connection, and in doing so some updates will be installed even if you have the updates box unchecked, because they don't fall under the \"updates\" category. This includes kernel updates which affects hardware support such as wifi. For more on that check out: What Does The Installer Download During The Installation Process? \n\n*During the installation process you will have the ability to decide if proprietary 3rd party software is installed, and if updates are installed. Some wifi drivers fall under the 3rd party category so if you don't install them you could have no wifi if your system needs one of those packages.\nInstalling Ubuntu On A USB Stick:\nIf you want to try out a Ubuntu installation running from usb rather than a live-cd/live-usb before setting it up on your hard drive just follow the normal proceedures for installing Ubuntu, but choose \"something else\" during setup. Then instead of selecting your hard drive/ssd choose your usb stick (which can't currently be running as a liveusb), and make sure to specify the boot manager be written to the stick as well so that it doesn't overwrite your Windows boot manager. For more on that check out this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/163544 . That posting is for usb hard drives, but it doesn't matter as the steps are the same. This will allow you to try Ubuntu without loosing Windows, because it's installed on a usb stick rather than your hard drive.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a UEFI system don't attempt a usb stick installation because sometimes the installer writes to the wrong ESP even if you've specified the correct one. This would affect your Windows installation.\n\n*On UEFI systems an internet connection is required during the installation process as the UEFI files aren't included on the disc. \n\n*Before attempting to install Ubuntu you should find out if you system is BIOS or UEFI as the installation process isn't exactly the same.\n\n*Usb stick installations are typically very slow, like a live-cd but worse, because many sticks have poor read/write.\n\nA: I want to say “yes”; but there was a case it got better after installation, and this makes me doubtful if it can get worse while it can get better!\nHowever, based on my experiences with installing Ubuntu on more than 20 different systems after trying it live, I can say yes, if it works great, it will do the same.\n", "Q: No network capabiity on dell vostro 1000 I just had a fresh install of ubuntu 14.04 and i have no network connectivity, i have a wifi capable computer, but there is no wifi connectivity, and the ethernet is not functioning either.

I click on the HDD and obtain the following\n\nI honestly don't really know whats going on. Looking at disks I have this...\n\nCan anyone help me out?  Cheers.\n\nA: You are doing pretty well for a self-described \"noob.\" \nThat error message just means Ubuntu can't read or mount the filesystem at /dev/sda1 for some reason. But it does see the disk and the partitions, so the disk hardware is running at least partly.\n\"read\" means understand whats there \n\"mount\" means connect it to a specific directory ( \"mount point\") so you can use the files.\nIf that drive partition, /dev/sda1. won't mount, you are screwed. But lets try to fix it... Go to a command line as root on your livecd. \n$ whoami\nsome-ordinary-user\n\n# whoami\nroot\n\n$ \"sudo su -\"  to get to root \n\nTry the e2fsck  fix the drive command:\n# e2fsck -p /dev/sda1\n\nIf you encounter errors, post them.\n\nadded below in an edit\n\nSo you are mounted. To test whats there:\n# mount\n\nThis will tell you the mount point, a directory.\n# cd <the path>/mountpoint\n# find . -type f\n# ls -la *\n\nalso useful\n# df -h\n# locate <some string you expect to be in a directory or filename>\n\nPS...   for command line messages just do a cut&paste instead of a bitmap.\n", "Q: Pycharm Pro and Ubuntu I have installed Pycharm on Ubuntu 14.04 using this useful guide. However the installation is the Community one and I'd like to get the Pro version for which I have a licence. \nIs there any way to upgrade or is it a case of uninstall and then follow this\nguide which is much more hassle, but compatible with the download available at the Jetbrains site. \n\nA: You don't need to follow any guide, specially not the complicated one. You just need to follow this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install java, Oracle java if possible.\n\n*Download and extract the version from the PyCharm site\n\n*Extract the file, run pycharm.sh from the bin folder\n\n*Optional, go to menu Tools > Create Desktop Entry to add it to your system menus.\n\n\nA: It is possible to install both versions but it will be counter productive sync your user defined settings from one to other.\nBefore you proceed further backup your settings. I am going to describe instructions for uninstalling Pycharm Community edition. You can also use this to remove Pycharm Professional edition. \nSuppose you have pycharm Community installed at /home/<user>/ide/.\nUse command this command rm -r ~/ide/pycharm-2016.3.2 to remove it.\nYou should also remove by these entries by using command rm -r. This contains your configs/license files for Pycharm.\nrm -r ~/.PyCharm2016.3\nrm ~/.gnome/apps/jetbrains-pycharm.desktop\nrm -r ~/.java/.userPrefs/jetbrains/pycharm\nrm ~/.local/share/applications/jetbrains-pycharm.desktop\n\nUse sudo updatedb && locate pycharm to check whether other pycharm files are still left. If you any files that has pycharm in the name which is useful to you than don't delete them.\nNOTE: If rm -r doesn't work use sudo rm -r.\n\nA: Like yourself, I'm a PyCharm Pro user - I gained this through my opensource developments.\nThe PyCharm Pro download is much larger than the community edition - this indicates that the extras bundled with Pro don't exist in the community edition.  Hence - to gain the benefit of the Pro, you basically uninstall the community and reinstall the new version.\nIts tidier to do it this way rather than untar'ing over the community install.\nThe only minor gotcha was that my local community installed edition created an icon desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications - this conflicted with the Pro version.  Hence, you'll need to remove the local file first before the Pro version is recognised. \n\nA: Incase if you’re on Ubuntu 16.04 or later and PyCharm is installed using snap package then you could remove it by running following commands:\nsudo snap remove [pycharm-professional|pycharm-community]\nrm -rf ~/.PyCharm2017.3\nrm -rf ~/.java/.userPrefs/jetbrains/pycharm/\n\nreplace .PyCharm2017.3 with your installed version.\n", "Q: Looking for a way to give acces to some programs for a limited period of time I install Linux on computers and add to the base installation some other programs. This computer then is sold to a customer as a larger instrument.\nNow, I am looking for a way to implement some kind licence for this computer so the user can use it for a year and then he would need to \"renew\" the licence. It is not my intention to lock the whole computer , blocking or deleting some folders should be enough. \nThe only way I could think of was to setup a cron job that deletes my programs, or a second way would be to set the user account to expire after a year.\nBut I give the computer with sudo privilages so the above solutions wouldn't be 100% safe.\nIt is not my intention to encrypt any code, I just want block the possibility to execute certain programs.\nIs there a way or a program that would \"licence the computer\" ?\nIdeally it should be invisible to the user. After one year the program stops working and \"he doesn't know why.\"\n\nA: You are doing it wrong. Yes, you could wipe some directory or file at some point (see at for scheduled tasks that should run at a certain date), but once a customer learns this, then you might run into trouble. It will also not prevent people from re-installing the Ubuntu and wiping our your restrictions.\nAs for running scheduled tasks using at, the following command should be self-explanatory:\necho 'mv /boot /boot.unsupported' | sudo at next year\n\nNote however that it is unethical for you to restrict access to this system which is made freely available by companies and volunteers. Consider taking a different approach where you charge for support.\nNew Ubuntu non-LTS releases are EOL'd after 9 months, LTS releases have a longer supported time (source: Ubuntu Wiki - Releases). If support for an Ubuntu version is about to expire or already expired, then you could contact your customer and propose to upgrade his/ her system and emphasize the importance of an up-to-date system (see Windows XP, I have seldomly see people care that much about changing software).\n", "Q: Run a Script when Power Button is Pushed I'm trying to run a script once I push the power button instead of having my machine turn off.

Please help.\n\nA: Windows is an operating system, MS-DOS/PC-DOS are operating systems. Windows took over DOS as the main operating system for Microsoft around Windows '95-Windows 2000 era for personal computers. You would set up your boot options in the BIOS of the computer (by pressing a key like F2, F8, F10, DEL, or other key) then go into boot options and set the boot order of the USB drive to a higher priority slot (usually 1, or on top).\nJust in case, make sure the USB is inserted (and it is bootable), if not check your Motherboard specs and see if it has the capabilities to boot from USB.

If so, then by \"near-copies\", it might be concluded that 'sda1' and 'sdb1' are in mirror, and so are 'sdc1' and 'sdd1', correct?\nAdd:\nAnd it was (partially) confirmed by the test here (http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-server-73/software-raid10-does-the-disk-order-in-mdadm-matter-671016/).\n\nA: /proc/mdstat lists them in the order they were activated/detected, which may change between boots.  The [number] is the logical order they appear in the array, and comes from the order given to mdadm --create.  In your case, using the near layout, sdb1 contains the copy of data on sda1, and sdd1 contains the copy of data from sdc1.\nNote that using the offset layout will give better performance since all 4 drives contain a stripe of all data, just like raid0, then the next stripe is all a copy of the first stripe, but rotated by one drive, so that each copy is on a different drive than the original.  Because the main copy of each stripe spans all 4 disks, reads can read from all 4 at the same time, giving higher throughput.\n", "Q: Wifi not working with Asus X551 and Ubuntu I just bought an Asus X551 and installed ubuntu but the wireless connections can't seem to work.

Is there any way to solve this problem?\n\n\n\n\nA: I would say not. It is quite normal for a Hard Disk to have some bad sectors, they can be caused by many reasons, and four is a small number. A Harddisk can have bad sectors when it comes right from the factory. Bad sectors are listed by the disk controller and are remapped, not used anymore. Modern Hard DIsks have spare sectors to replace the defective ones. When the number of bad sectors is considered to be a problem depends on the standards of the manufacturer of the disk.\nMore interesting than the absolute number of bad sectors would be to check after some time, and keep track if the number of bad sectors increases.\nReference:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bad sector - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n*S.M.A.R.T. - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n", "Q: How to create a script which opens the browser and logins to a particular Gmail account?

Hit Esc to leave the insert mode.\nCtrl+Shift+c and Ctrl+Shift+v are general commands to copy and paste text from Gnome Terminal to the clipboard, but I think you already knew that.\nI'm sure that real vim users would come up with more elegant solutions. As I said, I just installed GVIM and dug through the menus. (I tried using vim before, but always was lazy and went back to nano.)\n\nA: Vim has two registers for interacting with X text selection and clipboard. In your question you mention that you tried the \"* register, but there is another register for yanking to and putting from the X clipboard, namely \"+. As long as vim is built with X11 support (which the vim-gtk package has), both vim and gvim use these two registers for working with the X selection and clipboard buffers. Use the \"* register if you want to paste text that has been highlighted with the mouse and use \"+ to paste text that has been copied to the clipboard from another program.\nPaste from the clipboard in normal mode\nTo paste from the X clipboard into a vim buffer while in normal mode, use \"+p, \"+P, \"+gp, or \"+gP depending on whether you want the text to be inserted before or after the cursor location and where you want the cursor to end up after pasting. See :help put in vim.\nPaste from the clipboard in insert mode\nIf you are in insert mode in a vim buffer and want to paste the contents of the clipboard, use Ctrl+r and +. This will insert the clipboard text at the cursor location and keep you in insert mode to continue entering text after what was pasted. See :help i_CTRL-R in vim.\nPaste from the clipboard in command mode\nPasting from the clipboard in command mode (while entering commands after :) is exactly the same as in insert mode, use Ctrl+r followed by +. So, referring to your original example of copying a file name in the system's file browser, you could open that file in vim by starting the command :e, then Ctrl+r, and then + to paste the file name. See :help c_CTRL-R in vim.\n\nVim has a large set of registers, some of which are general purpose for the user, and some of which have specific functions. For more information about Vim registers in general, see :help registers in Vim's manual. For more about the difference between the X selection and clipboard buffers, see :help x11-selection. And the specific uses of the \"* and \"+ registers are described in :help quotestar and :help quoteplus.\n", "Q: Fan running constantly after installing ubuntu [dell inspiron 5520] i installed ubuntu 13.10 on my dell inspiron 5520 and this is my first experience with ubuntu or any OS other than windows..\nthe system starts up normally and functions although it seemsto be slower than win 8.1 (thats not much of an issue though) but once the fan starts running it wont stop untill i shut down the laptop. this is the only major issue i have with ubuntu\n\nA: One thing I would check would be the load of the system (as this is usually the case when the fan revs up), fire up a terminal and type:\nuptime\n\nTo read more about the load values, see for example this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21617500/understanding-load-average-vs-cpu-usage\nIf it seems high, you might also wanna dig deeper into the top command:\ntop \n\nand even checking all the process, with\nps -aux \n\ntrying to pinpoint if there are applications running hot.\n", "Q: add-apt-repository and update and install package I find add-apt-repository very userful and use it quite often.

Did someone already make that? Something like sudo add-apt-repository ppa:address -install package that works like the 3 commands but in one line. Would it be useful?\n\nA: Commands are best if they are modular. add-apt-repository is supposed to add a repository, that's it; it shouldn't update and install the package.\nIf you want a one-liner to do this, it would be best to do it using && operator as follows:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:address && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install <package>\n\nNote that the package will be install only if the previous two commands execute successfully (return 0).\nIf you want that the commands be executed irrespective of the return status of the previous commands(may be useful when ignorable errors occur- a 404 for some other ppa you have added and no longer exists), you can do this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:address; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install <package>\n\nNote the ; in place of &&- it is used to delimit two successive commands on the same line.\n", "Q: GRUB issue and botrepair won't work I'm having some issues with my freshly installed Ubuntu..\nIt seems GRUB didn't install properly (I installed \"alongside windows\" in UEFI).\nI tried to run bootrepair but it kinda stuck in a loop asking me \"Filesystem repair requires to unmount partitions.

That feature can cause filesystem corruption in a dual-boot configuration, and may be what's causing Boot Repair to say that it needs to repair a filesystem.\nOTOH, your /dev/sda3 is identified by partition type as a Microsoft Reserved partition, which is normally empty and is used by certain Windows partitioning tools; however, Boot Repair has identified it as a damaged ext4 filesystem. It's possible that you accidentally created an ext4 filesystem on it and then subsequently damaged it; or it may be a misidentification from random leftover data in the partition. Either way, that could be what Boot Repair is complaining about. If so, wiping it clean (as in dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda3) is probably safe -- but don't do this unless you can be certain that it doesn't hold valuable data!\nIt looks as if you've booted something (your original Ubuntu install and/or Boot Repair) in BIOS mode, which is the real cause of your main problem. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to control a medium's boot mode, particularly if you're unfamiliar with how a modern EFI works. I recommend you proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and prepare the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*If you haven't done so already, disable Secure Boot.\n\n*Boot the rEFInd medium. It will boot only in EFI mode. If it fails to boot, try again, but look for some other boot option -- trying to boot it in BIOS mode will cause a failure, but it should be possible to boot it in EFI mode.\n\n*Test that rEFInd can boot both Ubuntu and Windows. (Some entries may be non-functional; just be sure that you can boot both OSes.)\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu.\n\n*Do one of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Install the Debian-package version of rEFInd. Downloads are available from the rEFInd downloads page; or you can use the rEFInd PPA, as described later on the rEFInd downloads page. This will enable you to boot much as you did with the USB drive or CD-R, but from your hard disk.\n\n*Re-run Boot Repair. This will probably produce the same complaint about the partition that needs repair unless you correct the cause of the problem.\n\n\n\nNote that you may have some lingering issues, such as extra entries in the boot menu (whether that's rEFInd or GRUB 2). You'll need to deal with those after making the main repair to get both your OSes booting.\n", "Q: Lost disk after migrating from XP to Ubuntu After migrating from windows XP (they still exist ;) I \"lost\" the disk with 3 partitions on it. One of these partitions  was the windows system disk. This disk is now marked as \"unallocated\". How do I get access to this disk again? \nThnx for helping out...\n\nA: You can use Testdisk to recover your lost data.\n", "Q: How can I delete private information in a bug report? If I report a bug to launchpad using ubuntu-bug it usually adds a bunch of files about my system to the bug, it also adds a automatic generated bug summary to my bug report text. Both the summary and the attached files may potentially contain private imformation such as my user name, host name etc. I didn't find any option to edit the summary or the files. I just know how to delete the attachement. \nSo, how can I delete or change the private information in the summary and attached files?\n\nA: I don't think there is any easy way of removing any private information from crash logs, but your files should be uploaded privately as it's well explained in Ubuntu Wiki at Triage:\n\nApport reports\nA considerable number of bugs reported by Apport concern program\n  crashes which are reported semi-automatically and get pre-processed\n  automatically by bots in the Canonical data center. These bots try to\n  generate a fully symbolic stack trace and check for duplicates.\nIn Feisty and early Gutsy, those bugs were public, so that everyone\n  could see them. However, this created a privacy problem since core\n  dumps and stack traces could potentially contain sensitive\n  information. Also, crash reports generate a lot of bug mail noise.\n  With the automatic duplicate checking, a fair amount of the reported\n  bugs are completely irrelevant for triagers.\nSince Gutsy, these problems have been mitigated: bugs are filed with\n  the \"private\" flag enabled, i. e. only the reporter and subscribers\n  can see it. The reprocessing bots will subscribe the ubuntu-bugcontrol\n  team, but without sending bug email to the team members.\nThus crash bugs differ from other bugs in two important aspects: they\n  need to be checked for sensitive data, and there will not be any\n  initial bug mail for them until they become public. Triagers should\n  check the following things:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If the crash still has a CoreDump.gz attachment, then it was not    possible to automatically get a fully symbolic stack trace and check\n  for duplicates. In this case, the bug will be tagged with apport-failed-retrace.\n  \n*If the stack trace looks good enough, the    CoreDump.gz attachment should be removed with the (edit) link in the    attachment box. If\n  the retrace failed completely, mark the bug as    'Invalid' and ask\n  the reporter to refile the bug if the crash can be    reproduced.\n  Never mark a bug containing a Coredump.gz attachment as    public. If\n  there is no Stacktrace.txt (retraced) attachment, then the    most\n  probable reason is that the CoreDump.gz attachment is broken.\n  Please check with Martin Pitt (pitti in IRC, martin.pitt@ubuntu.com)\n  about the reason since he can look into log files. \n  \n*Check if any of    stacktrace attachments (original stacktraces, Stacktrace.txt    (retraced) and ThreadStacktrace.txt (retraced)) have\n  anything that    looks like sensitive data passed as function\n  arguments. Examples are    passwords, things that look like bank\n  account numbers, CSS keys, user    names, server names, etc. If you\n  don't find anything, you may mark    the bug as public (\"This report\n  is public/private\" in the top right    of the bug report). This is not\n  required though, it is fine to keep    the bug private throughout its\n  lifetime. Except for those privacy    issues, crash reports should be\n  handled like normal bugs in terms of    duplicate searching/marking,\n  upstream forwarding, etc.\n\nIf you don't want to send any private information, try to report the bug manually, without using ubuntu-bug tool.\n\nMore advanced method\nAlternatively report the bug by logged in by different user or from the virtual machine.\nOr scan the files before sending (if you know where they are) by cat/gzcat and strings, e.g.\nfind /var/log -name \\*.gz -exec sh -c \"gzcat '{}'|strings\"  \\;\nfind /var/log -name \\*.log -exec sh -c \"cat '{}'|strings\"  \\;\n\nWhere /var/log is the dir with compressed crash logs, use *.gz for compressed files, use *.log or whatever for non-compressed files. The command will print every string which is stored in these logs. You may also grep them for looking specific private data, if you know what you're looking for. \nIf you know which file it's, then just edit it or replace it by sed, e.g.\nsed -i'.bak' s/private/XXXXXXX/g name_of_the_file.log\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I report a bug?\n", "Q: How to turn a pdf into a text searchable pdf? I have a number of scanned documents in pdf and I want to be able to search them. How can I do that?\nEssentially I have to OCR the pdf and then blend the extracted text back into a new pdf. I have unsuccesfully tried a number of different solutions (including the ones found in Adding OCR info to a PDF).\n\n\n*\n\n*pdfocr (which gives me this issue: https://github.com/gkovacs/pdfocr/issues/7)\n\n*pdfsandwich (of which the software center says it is a poor package and I should not install it)\n\n*OCRfeeder (in the software center) exports to odt nicely, but does not react when exporting to pdf. \n\n*Gscan2pdf exports an all black (but searchable) image as reported in this discussion.\n\n*I don't think Pdfxchange viewer can handle doing ocr on the fly on files over 500 pages.\n\n\nIs there a software package I am unaware of? Or a script that does this?\n\nA: pdfsandwich performs exactly this job. I wasn't aware that there is a package provided in the software center, but I'm providing Ubuntu deb packages for it on the project website (see http://www.tobias-elze.de/pdfsandwich/ for details), including the currently most recent version (0.1.2), which is unlikely to be in any software center yet.\nIf you have a scanned file scanned_file.pdf, simply call\npdfsandwich scanned_file.pdf\n\nwhich generates the file scanned_file_ocr.pdf with the recognized text added to the scanned pages.\nCompared to most existing solutions, it autodetects the tesseract version installed and adapts its behavior accordingly. In addition, it performs preprocessing of the scanned images prior to the OCR  process, such as de-skewing or removal of dark edges etc., which can considerably improve optical character recognition.\nDISCLAIMER: I'm the developer of pdfsandwich and therefore heavily biased.\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 16.04 OCRmyPDF  has become available through apt. Just run\nsudo apt install ocrmypdf\nocrmypdf -h   # to see the usage\n\nFinally you can OCR your pdf with the command:\nocrmypdf input.pdf output.pdf  # change input and output to the files you want\n\nIf it seems the command is unresponsive, you can increase the verbosity using the -v flag (which can be used incrementally as -vv or -vvv). It might be best to test the results first on a shorter pdf. You can shorten a pdf as follows:\npdftk A=input.pdf cat A1-5 output output.pdf\n\nIf you have any question have a look in the Github repo.\n\nA: I had this same problem so I wrote this over the weekend. Give it a shot; it works great! It is a simple wrapper around tesseract.

However, it can be installed directly now (from 16.10 onwards).\nsudo apt install ocrmypdf\n\nThen you have to install the tesseract languages you need.\nTo list which languages are already in your system, type:\ntesseract --list-langs\n\nIn case you miss one, install it. For instance,\nsudo apt install tesseract-ocr-spa\n\nNow you can produce a searchable PDF (whose quality will vary, depending on the scanned document) with the following command\nocrmypdf -l 'spa' old.pdf new.pdf\n\nYou can, of course, check its man page for some additional options.\n\nA: OS: Ubuntu 18.04\nFirst, install tesseract-ocr with:\napt-cache show tesseract-ocr\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\napt-get install tesseract-ocr --print-uris\napt-get install tesseract-ocr\nsudo !!\n\nIf you are going to use a language other than English with tesseract, then you will have to install the corresponding laguage package. For example for Portuguese, you will need to do:\nsudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-por\n\nOtherwise you'll get the error:\nError opening data file /usr/share/tesseract-ocr/4.00/tessdata/por.traineddata\nPlease make sure the TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable is set to your \n\"tessdata\" directory.\nFailed loading language 'por'\nTesseract couldn't load any languages!\nCould not initialize tesseract.\n\nIf you Google \"tesseract PDF\" you will probably find this somewhat outdated post. However, it gives you some useful hints. You will first have to convert your .pdf file to a .tiff one. Run:\nconvert -density 125 originalfile.pdf -depth 8 -alpha Off newfile.tiff\n\nIf, as in the outdated post, you forget to add alpha -Off , you'll get the following error:  \nTesseract Open Source OCR Engine v4.0.0-beta.1 with Leptonica\nError in pixReadFromTiffStream: spp not in set {1,3,4}\n\nNow you can run the final command. In the particular case that your original PDF is in Portuguese, you will need this command:\ntesseract -l por newfile.tiff output pdf \n\nThe generated file will be named output.pdf . If, for example, your PDF is in French, after you install the corresponding tesseract-ocr-fra , you will run:\ntesseract -l fra newfile.tiff output pdf \n\nAnd the desired file will be, again, output.pdf .\n\nA: OCRfeeder has a bug in\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/reportlab/pdfgen/textobject.py\n\nline 436 should read:\n            lines = asUnicode(stuff).strip().split('\\n')\n# bug here, was:\n#            lines = '\\n'.split(asUnicode(stuff).strip())\n\nchanged this and it worked for me\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 16.04, OCRmyPDF has become available through apt. Just run the following command to install it:\nsudo apt install ocrmypdf\n\nYou can also run this command to see its usage:\nocrmypdf -h\n\nFinally, you can OCR your PDF with the command:\nocrmypdf input.pdf output.pdf\n\n(change input.pdf and output.pdf to the files you want)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I've not understood yet what's going on but the device seems not able to enumerate on pci bus. I fixed that by cold boot on windows (with official driver).\nI found some tutorials for rts5209 and tried to adapt them : \nhttps://vidyut.net/realtek-sd-card-reader-working-ubuntu/\nhttp://dainaccio.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/realtek-sd-reader-mounting-problems-under-linux-mintubuntu/#more-836\nI took the sources for RTS5229 from realtek website (PCIE RTS5229 card reader driver for Linux) : no more than 2 links in my message, tutorials seems more important --> google\nthen I had do do a little more code modification than in the linked tutorials in rtcx.c in order to build without error : comment the declaration of proc_info in the rtsx_host_template initialization line 206.\n(before)\n.proc_info = proc_info, \n\n(after)\n//.proc_info = proc_info,\n\nonce I get through this I built the driver and try to go with it, but obviously the link between driver and hardware was not there.\nSo I took the name of my device and try to modify the code in order to have the right device name. \nGo in the first lines (55) of rtsx.h and adapt the definition of the device name to your need : \n(before)\n#define CR_DRIVER_NAME \"rts5229\"\n\n(after)\n#define CR_DRIVER_NAME \"rts5227\"\n\nAfter what I modified the target of the Makefile : \n(before)\nTARGET_MODULE := rts5229\n\n(after)\nTARGET_MODULE := rts5227\n\nafter what \nmake clean\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo depmod\nsudo modprobe rts5227\n\nverify that your device is not using rtsx_pci module (lspci -v) if its the case you need to use the Dainaccio way to fix that (near the end of second tutorial).\nwhen your module is correctly loaded a ls /dev should show you a new interface (for me /dev/sdb) :D\nIn fact that's not really clean.The thing is there should be a lot more understanding of the difference between the 2 card reader version and a lot more understanding of the driver to make that work fine.\nThe driver is basically functional, you can mount / unmount partition, write and read on the card, insertion and removal is detected. I have not tested the automount. But anyway a lspci -v with the driver working will show you that this solution is not clean : the peripheral class is not recognized so others values I think.

You can configure it by entering 'Desktop Sharing' in the dash search, or from the command line by running vino-preferences.\n\nStandalone vncservers (such as vnc4server and tightvncserver) use their own session startup file located at $HOME/.vnc/xstartup, and the default file that ships with the package just starts a simple X terminal window on a plain gray root window (which is probably what you're seeing). \nYou can find a sample $HOME/.vnc/xstartup file in the Ubuntu Community Help Wiki at VNC/Servers - Customizing your session which you can copy and edit to start your chosen desktop session - which must sorrespond to one of the available .desktop files in your /usr/share/xsessions directory. Note that the ubuntu-2d session referred to in the Wiki is no longer available in 13.10.\n", "Q: Wireless Broadcom 4313 Ubuntu 14.04 connection established but no traffic another Broadcom 4313 issue.

According to me, your bluetooth and wifi are soft blocked.\nTry combination of function keys, if you are using a laptop.\nit will solve your problem, I think, your wireless is soft blocked.\n", "Q: automatically set sudo chmod 777 is there a way to automatially set sudo chmod 777 for all the files, folder and subfolders in a directory. The sudo chmod 777 should automatically be set when a folder or a file is created in the parent directory.\nIs there a way to do that?\n\nA: In bash execute umask 000 and then every directory you create will have permissions 777 and every file you create will have permissions 666. You can't create executable files by default, you need to explicitly make them so using chmod. It is a security feature.\nNote that the umask is \"bitwise xor\" of the desired file permissions and to get the most permissive mode of 777 you need to use umask 000.\nIn recent Ubuntu systems you set the systemwide umask in file /etc/login.defs. Older systems use /etc/profile.\nPlease do have in mind that people who create operating systems know a thing or two about security and have chosen umask 022 for a reason. You will make your computer quite insecure if you follow this advice.\n\nA: One way that comes to mind is the setfacl command.  Here's an Ubuntu guide on how to enable ACL (access control lists) for a mount point.  To summarize, install the relevant package\nsudo apt-get install acl\nthen, add the option 'acl' to the mount point in /etc/fstab\nUUID=07aebd28-24e3-cf19-e37d-1af9a23a45d4    /home    ext4   defaults,acl   0   2\nfinally, remount the drive so the changes take effect\nsudo mount -o remount /home\nAfter doing this, you can use the setfacl and getfacl to set options for any directory or file in particular.  ACL options for directories also include the ability to set default permissions for new files and subfolders with commands like the following:\nsetfacl -d -m u::rwx /folder/to/modify  # Default permissions for owning user\nsetfacl -d -m g::rwx /folder/to/modify  # Default permissions for owning group\nsetfacl -d -m o::rwx /folder/to/modify  # Default permissions for others\n\nFor reference, here's the man page for setfacl.  Also, while these permissions will apply by default to newly-created sub-files and folders, setfacl can still be used to change the rights after the fact if desired.  Finally, after enabling ACLs, you can see which files/folders have an ACL replied in the output of your ls -l command by looking for a + symbol after the permissions.  For example,\n-rw-r--r--+  # Has ACL applied\n-rw-r--r--   # No ACL applied\n\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04 says it's connected to wifi but is really slow and won't connect to any website as if there is no internet connection Like I said the wifi indicator says it's connected to the internet with like all of the bars (I'm right next to my wifi box) but, when I open up firefox, it won't connect to any website as if there was no internet connection.

Following is the example that I tried:\nI have created abc.sh file and run this script on background, like sh abc.sh &.\nNow this file is running on background and I fire the ps aux | grep \"abc\" command. \nFollowing is the output of this command:\nprakash     3594  0.0  0.0   4388   820 pts/0    S+   16:44   0:00 grep --color=auto abc\n\nAfter that I stop the abc.sh running script and fire the same command ps aux | grep \"abc\" command.\nBut I am getting same output like: \nprakash     3594  0.0  0.0   4388   820 pts/0    S+   16:44   0:00 grep --color=auto abc\n\nIs there any other way to find the process is running or not?\n\nA: My problem with grep is that it's a whole-line parser. In your example, you're searching for \"abc\" but it's pulling back the instance of grep (that's looking for \"abc\"). A bit circular. You can filter that out but I find all that a little perverse.\nI would turn to awk for a little panache.\nps aux | awk '$12==\"abc.sh\"'\n\nawk splits the lines into fields based on whitespace (by default). Fields $11+ are the command column(s) so if the command is \"sh abc.sh ...\", $11 will be sh and $12 will be abc.sh.\nIf you want to control the output or chain on with Bash's && and || operators, you can but you'll need to be a little more clever. grep will exit with status code 1 (technical fail, triggers ||) if nothing is found but awk will always exit code 0. We can change this by telling it to exit if it finds something and throw a 1 if it doesn't:\nps aux | awk '$12==\"abc.sh\" {exit 0} END{exit 1}' && echo running || echo not running\n\nOf course if you just care about writing output to the screen, you could do that all in awk:\nps aux | awk '$12==\"abc.sh\" {print \"running\"; exit} END{print \"not running\"}'\n\n\nA: The right way to check in the current bash session if a process started in background, like sh abc.sh &, is already running or not is to use jobs builtin command.\nExample:\n$ sh abc.sh &\n[1] 6917\n$ jobs\n[1]+  Running                 sh abc.sh &\n\nThat's mean that the sh abc.sh process started in background is running. If the process has finished you will see something like:\n[1]+  Done                    sh abc.sh\n\nIf you have more processes running in background, you can restrict the output only to the \nsh abc.sh process using:\njobs sh\n\nSee help jobs for more info.\nThe above method will work only in the current session of bash. But if you are in another bash session (e.g. in another terminal window or tab, or in a script), aside from:\nps aux | grep \"[s]h bin/test.sh\"\n\nyou can use also:\npgrep -a sh\n\nwhich seems more simple to me. If you will see your typed command in the output (sh abc.sh in this case), that's means that the process is still running. If not, the process has finished.\n\nA: Every process will be listed in the output of ps aux; whether running, sleeping, zombie or stopped.\nHowever, in your case, since you ran the process using sh abc.sh, sh is the application(shell) that is running and not abc.sh. Hence, ps aux will not contain the process abc.sh because of which grep could not yield any result.\nSo, the correct way you should have used it is as:\nps aux | grep sh\n\nThis may also return you other process that are running having the string sh anywhere in their output of ps aux.\nYou should note that the process will be \"running\" when the output of ps aux has its STAT as R. If it is something other than that, it is not running at the instance you fired the command to check the running processes. The different process states can be found in the man page for ps:\nD    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)\nR    running or runnable (on run queue)\nS    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)\nT    stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced\nW    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)\nX    dead (should never be seen)\nZ    defunct (\"zombie\") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent\n\nYou could as well run the top command to check if the process is running or sleeping and the amount of CPU, RAM it is consuming. (This will again list your process as sh).\nHowever, if you do want your process to be listed as abc.sh, then you should have the first line of the script you are running as:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nso that the shell will know what application to use to run the script(sh in this case, change it to #!/bin/bash for bash) and then provide executable permissions to the process using:\nchmod +x /path/to/abc.sh\n\nreplacing /path/to/ with the location of the abc.sh file and then run abc.sh using\n/path/to/abc.sh\n\nagain replacing /path/to/ with the location of the abc.sh file.\n\nA: If your script is currently running, it must be shown by ps aux command. If it not shown by ps, then there may be your script execution is currently terminated.\nOutput of ps like this means your script is currently not running,\n$ ps aux | grep hm.sh\navinash   6386  0.0  0.0  15940   932 pts/16   S+   17:34   0:00 grep --color=auto hm.sh\n\nIf it shows like this, which means your script is currently running.\n$ ps aux | grep hm.sh\navinash   6454  0.0  0.0  16616  1384 pts/16   S+   17:35   0:00 /bin/bash ./hm.sh\navinash   6535  0.0  0.0  15940   932 pts/27   R+   17:35   0:00 grep --color=auto hm.sh\n\nIt's all based on the contents of the script.\nFor example, if you create a script like this. It displays the message HI on execution. It takes a few seconds to display the output and got terminated after it produces the final result.\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"HI\"\n\nBut if your script like this,\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIt takes some minutes to get the process terminated. On the meantime if you run ps aux | grep filename command, it will be shown on the output. Because the script is currently running.\n\nA: you can always use pgrep to check if the process in running\npgrep -c \"process name\"\n\nwhat this command does is count how many process were found with the name \"process name\" and returns thier number [0 is the process was not found]\n\nA: *\n\n*if you want to check all processes then use 'top'\n\n*if you want to know processes run by java then use ps -ef | grep java\n\n*if other process then just use ps -ef | grep xyz or simply /etc/init.d xyz status\n\n*if through any code like .sh then ./xyz.sh status\n\nA: if you simply want to check whether there is any under process then go to that directory and type ll -tr if you see .csv or .work etc at the end of the file then it means under process else not. \n", "Q: Very slow internet speed in 14.04 I am using firefox/opera for browsing, tried wired/wireless connection but it does not change the situation.

It can't store the whole Windows install as that would be much more than 8GB. Also if I would do a clean install of Ubuntu could I use the 8GB SSD to have Ubuntu boot up quicker.

As I do in my desktop. I think you don't need to format your Windows from SSD device. Just free up 8GB space from your 500GB HDD using \"Windows Disk Manager\" from \"Control Panel\". Insert Ubuntu boot media such as a Live CD/DVD or a bootable pen drive, run \"wubi\", click on \"Full Demo\" and restart.

I left it as a new unallocated volume (I left it as free unpartitioned and unformatted space). As for the Secure Boot and UEFI settings in the BIOS, I left them enabled (since I read in ask Ubuntu that it is always better to try installing with both options enabled) and shut down the laptop. Something worth mentioning, I read an article that said I should switch to CSM Mode before shutting down and then install Ubuntu; I did not do that. When I change the boot manager from UEFI to CSM Boot, it does not boot anything coz of copyright issues. Plus, Ubuntu boots in legacy mode and not UEFI Mode.\nWith try Ubuntu I was able to boot the live version without problems, then started installing Ubuntu and when I got to the system installation window there was no option that said “install alongside windows 8”. So I picked “something else”, made a 5.77 GB partition (read somewhere that it is supposed to be 10% the size of the main system partition) for swap area and 51.22 GB for booting the main system ( / ). After Installation GRUB menu opened and I could open Ubuntu without problems but with windows, it gave me an error and did not want to boot it. I ran boot repair and it closed with an error and gave me a pop out message saying I should turn off secure boot. After that, there was no GRUB and it boots straight to windows.\nHere is the first boot repair link: paste.ubuntu.com/7517709\nI then formatted the partitions again and did the whole thing again with secure boot disabled this time. Again no GRUB menu and boots straight to windows 8 (yes windows 8 on my laptop works with secure boot disabled), so I entered the live version and ran boot repair again. This time it did not tell me that I should disable secure boot, but it did not solve the problem either. Same problem, no GRUB and boots straight to windows.\nHere is the first boot repair link: paste.ubuntu.com/7536732\nA couple of more points:\n· I cannot change the OS boot manager in BIOS, i.e. I cannot choose boot priority between windows 8 & ubuntu.

I can browse files stored in windows partition in ubuntu os but I cannot browse or see ubuntu partition in 'my computer' in windows. Please help how can I access my files of ubuntu partition in windows 7 partition?\n\nA: Ubuntu is most likely using ext3 or ext4 filesystem format. Windows can not recognize this format and will not interact will drives/partitions using ext* filesystem.\nTo access your files between both systems, you can create and additional fat32 partition on the drive and have it automatically mount in both OSes. AFAIK fat32 is the best filesystem format for interoperability between Linux and Windows.\n", "Q: Can I save a file from RAM? To be more specific, here's the situation.\nI was working on MyPaint from a blank document and, after a few hours during which I didn't save anything (of course…) the program freezed. I didn't close it.\nIn the MyPaint autosave directory, the file is corrupted (1,4 ko only).\nSo, I was wondering if I can dump the file from the RAM (the process is still running) and how.\nThank you.\n\nA: Slightly better than saving memory would be to have the program save your work for you.\nFirst obtain the pid (process ID) of the running program.  This can be done from a command line with the ps command:\n$ ps x\n  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND\n(... lots of usual programs omitted)\n 3039 ?

Then at least, someone familiar with the internals of MyPaint could load it into the debugger and reconstruct the data for subsequent use.  This is \"hard\" though and will involve hours to days of expert attention.\nTo dump core, try these.  Core dumps might not be enabled in your system's configuration.\n$ kill -ABRT 3039       # abort\n$ kill -QUIT 3039       # quit\n$ kill -SEGV 3039       # illegal memory access\n$ kill -TRAP 3039\n\n\nA: you may know that ram doesnt save any files. so you wont be able to recover anything from it. i reccomend to start redoing it and save frequentley next time(or setup a script to autosave for you). im very sorry, but there isnt anything else you can do to recover it(as far as i know).\n", "Q: Mozilla Eudora in Ubuntu 12.04 Although manual installation is possible, can Mozilla's Eudora be integrated in Ubuntu 12.04 Software Center?\n\nA: You can use the PPA: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-daily/+archive/firefox-aurora\nRemember daily use is not guaranteed.\nPPA description\nThis PPA contains builds of Firefox from the aurora channel\nAll users of this PPA are encouraged to report any bugs they find.

So is there a way that I can do this?\n\nA: In theory, both virtualbox and KVM can boot your existing installation directly from hard drive. It is much easier to boot Ubuntu using VBox on windows then boot an existing windows install with KVM or VBox from Ubuntu.\nIn practice, booting an existing installation in this manor can be error prone and damage the existing install. It is much better to do an installation in a vitrual disk , as is the default behavior.\n\nWarning\nRaw hard disk access is for expert users only. Incorrect use or use of an outdated configuration can lead to total loss of data on the physical disk. Most importantly, do not attempt to boot the partition with the currently running host operating system in a guest. This will lead to severe data corruption.\n\nSee : \nHow to use a real partition with Windows 7 installed, in a virtualbox vm?\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/31260/booting-the-already-installed-windows-from-the-virtualbox-installed-in-ubuntu\nhttp://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/784138-howto-boot-existing-ubuntu-partition-using-virtualbox-inside-windows/\n\nA: You can also convert an existing installation to a virtual machine version.

The help article also gives a routine for encrypting entirely from the terminal, but I am hesitant to try because apparently it hasn't been tested since version 10.04.\nSo my questions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*is there a Gnome-disk-utility package available for 14.04 (and if so, where); or failing that \n\n*is the command line routine reliable for 14.04?\nAny help would be much appreciated. \n\nA: You can easily install the Disk Utility in 14.04: \nsudo apt-get install gnome-disk-utility\n\nIf this doesn't work, please post the exact error messages that you get.\nTo then open Disk Utility check this question: \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I open Disk Utility in Xfce?\nIt allows to very easily create encrypted partitions: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to encrypt external devices?\n", "Q: xmodmap pointer setting doesn't affect all applications I have a laptop designed for windows 8 and running ubuntu 14.04. Because it is designed for windows 8, the touchpad is backwards. The scroll bars on the side and top are reversed so that it feels like the opposite of a scroll wheel.

I recognize that utilities exist, such as gpick, grabc, gcolor2 that provide me with RGB or hex values. However, what I really want is for it to tell me that the color that I am looking at is \"Red\" or \"OrangeRed\" or some other name that I can relate to. A windows utility that does this is \"What Color.\" Is there a linux equivalent or workaround? Like maybe I could pipe the output of gpick through some program that translates the hex to some English name for the color?

I've ran the software updater, and it's downloaded and installed a bunch of 3.13 packages (the image, and the header, and whatever else), and then it requested a reboot. Following the reboot, my kernel version is still 3.4.0. I've also tried manually installing the three 3.14 packages, and then rebooting, but this has had no effect. What am I missing?\n\nA: Okay, after digging around I realized that it's because I'm using Chrubuntu, which uses the pre-existing kernel from ChromeOS, and doesn't boot with GRUB at all.

The cause was my graphic adapter driver (newer versions of Xorg, Lightdm or whatever after update/upgrade conflicted with it). Reinstalling/updating Nautilus, Xorg etc. didn't help but complete uninstall of graphic driver did the job. In my case it was Nvidia so I typed to the command line sudo apt-get purge Nvidia*, then restarted. Of course it started with crapy resolution and required to reinstall the driver but it worked and works so far.\nSo the sequence that worked for me was:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\nsudo apt-get install gdm (then choosed lightdm)\nsudo apt-get purge Nvidia*\nsudo reboot\nThe \"password loop\" disappeared and then I just installed again my Nvidia driver to restore acceptable screen resolution.\n", "Q: Why a subshell is needed to execute some commands?

When entering the right password the application or the OS (no specific application, pretty much everywhere) accepts this immediately, but when entering a wrong password there is a slight delay of 1-2 seconds. Why is that?\n\nA: The delay is to slow down cracking attempts made by automated software. Without a delay cracking attempts would run much faster.\nDocumentation: See man pam_fail_delay\n\nRATIONALE\n   It is often possible to attack an authentication scheme by exploiting\n   the time it takes the scheme to deny access to an applicant user. In\n   cases of short timeouts, it may prove possible to attempt a brute force\n   dictionary attack -- with an automated process, the attacker tries all\n   possible passwords to gain access to the system. In other cases, where\n   individual failures can take measurable amounts of time (indicating the\n   nature of the failure), an attacker can obtain useful information about\n   the authentication process. These latter attacks make use of procedural\n   delays that constitute a covert channel of useful information.\n\n   To minimize the effectiveness of such attacks, it is desirable to\n   introduce a random delay in a failed authentication process. Preferable\n   this value should be set by the application or a special PAM module.\n   Standard PAM modules should not modify the delay unconditional.\n\n\n", "Q: Repair boot after update from 13.10 to 14.04 LTS I have an Ubuntu server that's been around for some time and has gone through several upgrades without any major problems.

Can you give a Normal account  \"limitations\" to do not install or remove anything or to not open any program? Can you also \"hide/deactive\" the terminal and console for a normal user?\n\nA: User accounts are not allowed to use the sudo \ncommand, meaning there is no way for them to access any root privileges, meaning no package installations or filesystem tampering, etc.\nTo block a user from using a program, a simple way is to create a whitelist for that program. To do this, use the following commands in the terminal:\nsudo addgroup GROUP\nsudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/PROGRAM\nsudo chown root:GROUP /usr/bin/PROGRAM\nadduser alice GROUP\nadduser bob GROUP\n\nWhere GROUP is the name you want for the whitelist for the program, PROGRAM is the name of the program, and \"alice\" and \"bob\" are replaced with the actual users on your system you want to allow access.

Requesting power off\"\n\n*Via the web interface, I added the node. I added the information needed. One part I did not know was the Power type. I just selected Wake-on LAN and gave the same Mac address as that on the computer. Is this even correct? If not, what do I need to give?\n\n\nAfter 2, I did 1. again - still same problem.\nProblem B: In Web Interface, it says it is commissioning for the node for a long term.\nAny action I try to do, it says \"The action \"Commission selected nodes\" could not be performed on 1 node because its state does not allow that action.\" \nAny suggestions are appreciated.\n\nA: If you haven't already, you need to configure the cluster to manage DHCP and DNS on the network that the new nodes are going to be on. You can find instructions for that here.\nOnce DHCP is configured, you can delete the existing node (it's easier to start with a clean slate). The simplest way to add a new node to a MAAS cluster is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the node's BIOS, change the boot order so that it boots from the LAN first. This will allow it to PXE boot from the MAAS cluster controller.\n\n*Power the node on. You don't need to have a CD in the machine; it should boot from the network.\n\n*Once the node has booted from the network it will show up in MAAS as \"declared\". You can then accept the node into your MAAS and begin the commissioning process.\n\n\nThe full instructions for adding new nodes can be found here\nAs far as your second problem is concerned, I think this is down to two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*An incorrect power type (if you don't have a specific power controller for the node then Wake-on-LAN makes sense, but if the node's not configured to Wake-on-LAN it won't work).\n\n*MAAS hasn't actually seen the node on the network yet.\n\n\nIf you follow the procedure above, the node should show up in MAAS automatically, without you having to add it manually.\n", "Q: Using Apache2 to set up a basic webpage I am having a problem with a test page I set up for my website.

I am trying to set up a social networking website at home just a\nsmall local website for right now. I am doing everything on my own. I turned my old 2009 HP desktop into a server, Ubuntu Server 14.04, with light weight GUI desktop, installed flashplugin and installed update, about to install OpenSSH to be sure it's on here. I think I choose samp also when I did the install CD today. I need to know how to create a remote access to this machine since I won't have anything connected to it besides power cord and ethernet cable. I would like remote access to the PC from another with my laptop so I don't have to stay in one spot all the time. I have a few questions below. \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I do remote access, and what should I use? - PUTTY? Webmin?\n\n*Database to store names and accounts of the social network: Can I store database and web server together on the same computer?\n\n*What step would be after all this?\n\n*Last question what commands should I do to complete setup for a website on the my old desktop?\n\n\nA: If you want to do it right, you should learn to use and love the terminal.  Don't know how well you know it now, but the bash terminal is a great thing to know, and has lots of features (type man bash and see if you can figure it out, if you don't know it now.  The learning curve is a bit steep, but once you learn, you can administer your server easily from anywhere).\nThere is good documentation on the Ubuntu site for setting up a server.  \nYou should install the OpenSSH server (sshd), and the OpenSSH client on your desktop.  That's all you need to log onto the server and do everything you need just like if it was local.  You can run programs on the server, but display it on the client.  You do not need Putty or any other software to do this.\nNormally, you would install a database on the server, such as SQL server, which can be accesses by the Web Server, such as Apache.  Users create accounts on the website, and they are stored in the database.  You can install and administer all this using ssh.\nAs far as what to do after this, the Ubuntu guide will be good, but you don't need to install everything.  Start with ssh, then the web server, database server, PHP, and possibly phpMyAdmin, but it depends on what you will be doing  with the website.\nThe traditional LAMP server is Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.  This is what you usually get with a hosted website (non-windows one, at least).\nYou might want to go through a tutorial on creating websites, if you don't know what you are doing.  There are some good hands-on tutorials, although I'd have to check on which ones are still around, since it's been a couple of years since I've done any websites.  But I taught myself in a pretty short amount of time, and got jobs setting up and programming a bunch of sites for local companies.\nEDIT:  By the way, I personally would advise against installing LAMP as one installation.  It's really not hard to set it up individually, and adding a level of indirection to me just complicates things.  If something goes wrong, it's harder to figure out what it is.  And when you need to modify something, it might be more complicated, or even not possible without learning how the stack works first.\n", "Q: How to mass install Edubuntu on a Chromebook? I've been asked to post my question here from /r/ubuntu on Reddit.\nI'm prepping a computer-lab in a box project for a school in Malawi, Africa.

Anyone know of a way to do a mass install of Ubuntu on Chromebooks?\n\nA: I would recommend a fully automatic installation with FAI project this could be done using PXE install or an unattended CD installation. Many other options are also available.\nYou can see what could be done in the following youtube video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIZL_iyAww\n", "Q: File permissions changed when using Copy (file syncing software) I just started using Copy, and it seems great, though I am having one difficulty. I'm running two Xubuntu Linux computers, one at work and one at home. The one at work is 64 bit and the one at home is 32 bit (I don't know if this is a problem or not, though presumably it shouldn't be). The problem is that when I drop a file into the /Copy folder from either end it'll show up on the other computer but with its permissions changed.\nSpecifically, if I write a test ASCII file in emacs and save it, it'll have the permissions:\n-rw-rw-r-- 1\n\nHowever, it'll show up on the other end with permissions:\n-rwx------ 1\n\nThis can be particularly annoying, especially since executable files are colored green by the shell. Is there any fix around this?\n\nA: You can use rsync to copy your files. The -p option will preserve permissions and so many options:\n-p          --> Preserve permissions \n-E          --> Preserve Executability\n-o          --> Preserve OwenrShip\n-g          --> Preserve Groups\n-t          --> Preserve modifition time\n\nfor further redings use this link\n\nA: cp also can copy files preserving permissions, ownership etc. For this you need to use the --preserve switch. Here's the corresponding manual entry:\n--preserve[=ATTR_LIST]\npreserve the specified attributes (default:\nmode,ownership,timestamps), if possible additional attributes:\ncontext, links, xattr, all\n\nBut as Fiximan suggested cp -a would be simpler. From man pages again,\n-a, --archive ; same as -dR --preserve=all\n\nSo the command would be something like:\ncp -a <source> <destination>\n\n\nThat being said, since you are copying files, especially between a computer at work to home via the internet, it is best to use scp. scp has the -p switch which will preserve modification times, access times, and modes from the original file. You may also want to use the -r switch to recursively copy folders and subfolders. Here is a good guide on how use scp to transfer files. \n\nA: If you are vendor-locked on Copy, you can ask support on their site about preserving attributes.\nIf you have GUI, I suggest to use FreeFileSync. \nIt\n\n\n*\n\n*is open-source (GPLv3) software;\n\n*works great with local and remote (FTP, SMB/CIFS, SSH via GVFS) files;\n\n*compares by attributes and by content;\n\n*have flexible sync settings (two way, mirror, update, custom);\n\n*has real-time sync agent;\n\n*preserves attributes and allows to copy file access permissions.\n\n\nAlso you can try Unison (Ubuntu package available) or any other program from Wikipedia list.\n", "Q: Installing Armory on Ubuntu after installing Bitcoin I installed Bitcoin-qt with Ubuntu 14.04.

The computer rebooted before it got to the desktop or any graphics (when using a CD). \nI managed to install Ubuntu server edition. I installed the kubuntu-desktop on the computer.

You can find most of them in the /var/log directory. I would suggest you start with the boot.log and bootstrap.log files. There are also some program files in that directory. If you find a program that is suspect in a log I would then go and find the log files for that program to investigate the problem further.\nThe log files can be accessed either by using the file explorer or opening a terminal window and typing the following commands:\ncd /var/log\nls\nnano nameoffile.log\n\nExample log file name\nnano boot.log\n\nnano is a command that opens a simple text editor for you to read the file from the terminal window. \"ls\" is the list function, it will list all sub-directories. \"cd\" is the change directory command and will allow you to move directories. I don't know if you are using a version of Ubuntu with a graphical interface or not so I included the necessary terminal commands.\n", "Q: Wifi is hard locked I just got a new laptop and installed Ubuntu on it.

I meet some trouble doing \"grub-install /dev/sda\", which reported disk \"/dev/md120\" not detected . There are lots of discussions regarding this problem but no very clear solution. I end up manually modifying /boot/grub/device.map with a new line \"(md120) /dev/md120\", then grub-install goes through with no error reported.\nWhen booting, after passing the machine logo, the next window shows RAID volumes: not detected, followed by the information of four hard drives (marked as not raid disk). Then error: no such device plus a long key (like uuid). Then \"grub rescue >\".\nIn grub rescue, I try \"ls\" but \"(md120)\" is not there. Apparently, the RAID is not recognized properly and previous \"grub-install\" is a fake success.\nAlready spent a few hours, so what goes wrong and how to fix it? Thanks a lot, really appreciated.\nBTW, I install RAID using system rescue cd and then chroot. The boot partition is imaged from another similar system. The content looks fine when I check.

I can't seem to find these steps anywhere.\nI think I have to use UEFI but please advise.\nAlso note that it's ok with me to format both drives before going forward.\nThanks a bunch!\n\nA: I think what you want to do would be a little bit simpler than doing an install on one drive.  I assume you are familiar with some more advanced terminology here since you said you were reading up on the subject, but please ask if anything is unclear.\nYou need to first get your install ISO's downloaded:\n--Getting a Windows 8 install ISO may be the hardest part of this procedure.  (But you don't need if it is already installed.)\n--Ubuntu desktop ISO.  (I presume you want Ubuntu 14.04 / amd64 because your computer is 64 bit).  If possible, create two bootable usb sticks, one for each.  You can easily have a second computer handy to switch from one bootable iso to another and use just one usb drive, or once you install windows, download Lili usb creator and create the Ubuntu install drive.  Alternatively you could make DVD's if your target computer has a DVD drive.  \nYou need to disable secure boot in your bios.  If Windows 8 is already installed, it is easy to find a guide for this.  (For the love of your sanity, don't format the Windows 8 already installed.)  You have to shift-right-click restart in the lower right corner power menu to get to Advanced settings and access the bios.  Please note the menu progression is totally different twixt 8 and 8.1.  While in the bios turning off Secure boot, your bios might have an option to allow you to turn on F8/F10/F12/or del key to let you access the bios, which Windows 8 PC's have to ship with the option off.  (This is for convenience as you probably need to go into the bio a lot as a dual booter.)\nIF you are totally installing both OS's, you have the option to turn the UEFI off in the bios.  But this is not advisable because UEFI protects you from rootkit \"viruses\".\nWe also need to do some planning.  We ultimately need the bios to boot first to the SSD drive.  However, we will install each OS separately with only one drive attached at a time, so this can be a last step for you.\nWe want the Linux drive to be the primary boot drive because if we can avoid replacing a part of the windows boot system with GRUB2, we should.  Windows gets cranky when it doesn't find what it expects in the boot sectors of the drive when it goes sniffing around to auto-fix itself.  So we can prevent that conflict from ever happening.\nIf you are planning partitions, there is something important to think about.  If you have Windows 8 fast boot turned on, Ubuntu cannot read the Windows partition.  This means that if you want to share files, you need to plan on having an NTFS or FAT32 partition that they both can share nicely.  Also, hibernating windows and booting Linux will cause Windows to lock Ubuntu out of any hard drive that a Windows program had just one file open on--> perhaps on the nice little data sharing hard drive partition you set up.  So don't hibernate and then boot Ubuntu.  (Yes, I learned this the hard way...)\nYou want to install Windows 8 first.\nThe key trick is to only have the one hard drive you plan to use for Windows connected.\nI think that you already have Windows 8 installed on the HD and are adding the SSD?  If this is the case, you are done installing Windows, hurray!\nHowever, you will need to disable Secure Boot. (as above)\nNow, power down the computer and disconnect the Windows 8 hard drive and attach the Linux hard drive.  Install Linux.\nAfter it is installed and you get online, run these commands in terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\nBoot-repair is going to get the whole thing dual booting later.\nNow, power down and attach both hard drives.  Set up bios so that we boot to the SSD/Linux.  (If your bios setting is wrong, you'll just go to windows instead.  No problem try again.)\nNow that we are happily booting Linux, run boot-repair and follow the instructions.  This should set up your boot menu to let you switch between the OS's.  And ta-da, all done.\nNow if for some reason boot-repair goes all haywire on you, first of all, you can just tell the bios to switch to Windows and there you go, you can still boot something.\nAlso, you can use your Ubuntu 14 desktop usb stick to boot to Ubuntu.  Select try Ubuntu.  Then you can install boot-repair per the above instructions and try again.\n", "Q: Should a gamer switch to Ubuntu? I recently built a gaming PC, and I'm just wondering if putting Ubuntu (or any linux OS for that matter) onto a PC that is going to be used mainly for gaming is a bad/good idea. I know a lot of games are only available for Windows, the ones I play being Skyrim and Battlefield. Would I still be able to play those games using WINE? Or would I be better off using Windows? I have not installed any OS yet, and I don't plan on pirating Windows to run the two operating systems side by side. It would either be Ubuntu or Windows. Not both. So, please help?\n\nA: \nWould I still be able to play those games using WINE?\n\nNo. Well technically the answer could be yes but the experience is horrible. \nBF2 works with wine (platinum rating). BF3 does not (bronze/garbage rating). Skyrim also has a platinum rating. BUT as with anything wine related: getting it to work well will take some effort. \n\nOr would I be better off using Windows?\n\nYes. But do not dismiss dual booting so quickly: Ubuntu takes time to learn (like any operating system you start the 1st time). So you probably want to have a fall-back for the time being. Why not opt for dual boot? \nGaming on Linux is possible. And I mean gaming with high quality games; not the games currently in the games section of any Linux system (mahjongg, chess, bubble clones etc). Gaming on Linux currently is equal to Steam and Humble. The Linux games list on Steam is growing and growing. And it has some cool games too.  Unreal Tournament is coming soon. The Unreal engine is coming to Steam/Linux too. That means this list of games might be coming to Linux too (speculation on my part ;) )\nIf you like Civilization V you are in luck: their supported OS list got updated with \"Linux\" on steam. \n\nA: With the arrival of Steam, Humble Store, GOG (few months away), Desura and many other outlets serving games for Linux and specifically Ubuntu and its derivatives, I believe that the Ubuntu platform is ready for use as a gaming OS.\nSome numbers: The Steam Linux library has grown to 484 games for Linux. The Humble Store has around 260 games for Linux. Desura has 556 games for Linux. The Wine HQ platinum and gold ratings have 3874 games.\nSome recent games that are confirmed to come on Linux: Metro 2033, Metro Last Light, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, The Witcher 2, Stronghold 3 Gold, Wasteland 2, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Civilization V, and many more.\nIn addition, nearly all games announced on Kickstarter and other crowd funding platforms are coming/already are available for Linux. Games like Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity, Road Redemption, Shadowrun Returns, and many more crowd funded games support Linux.\nYes, some big games do not feature on Linux yet, but many of them are coming in the near future. For these, you can use Wine or PlayOnLinux (depends on Wine) or CrossOver Linux (from the supporters of Wine. This is a commercial software with excellent support for Windows games. And, it will cost just a fraction of what you will pay for Windows).\n\nA: Sorry to say mate, but as of now it is definitely a bad idea, as I am crazy about games as well as linux. right now only few .exe based applications can be used on to linux / ubuntu using wine. however it can't support majority of games.\n\nA: Normally Ubuntu is not for gaming but still  there are many open-source games for linux.\nYou can install Steam which make  you enable for Awesome games ( Paid+Free games).

So, you have to use either Gparted or the lvm tools (e.g. from inside Fedora, or Ubuntu Live CD) in order to shrink the partition and leave some space for Ubuntu and then use the \"something else\" option to install Ubuntu.\nOf course Ubuntu can be installed in a logical partition and if Gparted don't allow you to shrink the partition (because it is \"used\" as you said) this could be because of the swap partition that automatically mounted even if you boot from a Live image. \nSo, (assumed that you use the Gparted from Ubuntu Live CD)\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the LiveCD/USB and click on \"Try Ubuntu\".\n\n*Open Gparted, then right click on swap partition and swapoff. \n\n*Shrink the biggest partition(right click and resize) and leave some space for Ubuntu. Create a new logical partition. \n\n*Close Gparted and begin the installation. \n\n*Click on \"something else\" and there you must see the new created partition. \n\n*Click there and then click on \"Change\" in order to use the partition (create an ext4 filesytem and mount it on root /). \n\n\nAbout the second part of your question: \n\nIf so, as I would like Fedora to be my main OS, is there also a way\n  to make it the top Grub option?\n\nAfter the installation finish (with no errors), Ubuntu Grub will replace Fedora Grub in Disk's MBR. And so, you will have Ubuntu as main OS in Grub list. In order to replace Ubuntu Grub with Fedora Grub again, you must boot on Fedora and give the following command \nsudo grub2-install --recheck /dev/sda \n\nAbove command will reinstall Fedora Grub in Disk's MBR, so everything will back to \"normal\" (I mean as you already have it, with Fedora as fist OS in Grub list...etc). \n(at the moment, I'm not able to add a tutorial-like answer here, with pictures..etc. If someone is, feel free to edit this answer an make it better for everyone.)\n", "Q: installation 14.04 - Machine does not restart - stopping early crypto disks ok This is my first time to install Ubuntu version is 14.04 desktop. \nAfter installation on a virtual machine (Hyper V), It says to restart. \nIT will stop at:\nstopping early crypto disks      ok\nThen it will stop here and it seems I have to shutdown the virtual machine to restart Ubuntu. \nI am not sure if my installation is complete or not.\nThanks for any help. \n\nA: See this answer:\nWhat is ubuntu 14.04 doing while showing \"stopping early crypto disks\"?\nI killed the VM, went into (for that VM) Settings | System, and removed the Floppy (!) and CD/DVD from the boot order (leaving just Hard Disk).

I have been installing, reinstalling MAAS on an old PC of mine and I get the whole thing so far that I can login to the system on $ http://xx.xx.xx.15/MAAS. However from there it goes wrong...partly I guess because I don know what I´m doing.\n\n\n*\n\n*It starts with DNS & DHCP management: I have a network in my house with a Cisco router which has the option switched on for DHCP server. Does this mean, I should not interfere with the router? Or shall I switch it off and build my own thing? At the moment, I let MAAS still do the DNS&DHCP managment. \n\n*After that: adding nodes in de UI seems easy to do. I can even find and list them in command line. However when, I want to do $ maas maas nodes accept-all, it gives me ´[]´ and for the rest the node does not perform anything.\nThe documentation for MAAS (http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/index.html) was probably meant for smarter people, at least I don´t get what I´m doing wrong. I guess what I am missing is a step-by-step tutorial that explains every single box that I have to fill in. Apparently, I don fill them in correctly.\nWould be very thankful for help.\nGreets,\naqua\n\nA: You seem to have done everything right except for, most likely, the networking. The easiest way to get MAAS working right without interfering with the rest of your network is to enable MAAS control of DHCP and DNS, and to put the nodes on a separate network. So, your MAAS controller would have two NICs - one connected to the rest of your network, one connected to a switch which all the intended nodes are also connected to.\nYou can have them all on the same network, but it means manually configuring the DHCP and DNS (which MAAS requires to know where the nodes are on the network, and boot them) which can be a good deal trickier. see http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/configure.html#manual-dhcp-configuration\n", "Q: Graphic card definition how to download and install graphic card definitions , GEFORCE CUDA\nThants :) .

But this isn't working, typing \"ssh host.engin.x.edu\" responds with \"rob@host.engin.x.edu's password:\"\nWhat am I doing wrong? My resolv.conf includes \"search engin.x.edu\".\n\nA: Most of the times that ssh ignores a file, that's because file permissions are wrong. \nFor example, man ssh_config says:\n\n~/.ssh/config\nThis is the per-user configuration file.  The format of this file is described above.  This file is used by the SSH client.  Because of the potential for abuse, this file must have strict permissions: read/write for the user, and not accessible by others. It may be group-writable provided that the group in question contains only the user.\n\nYou must also check the permissions of all the parent directories of the file. I.e., if your home is /home/rob, you should check the permissions of /home, /home/rob, /home/rob/.ssh, and /home/rob/.ssh/config.\nAssuming that your home has already secure permissions, a command that often helps is:\nchmod -R go= ~/.ssh\n\nRemember that ssh -vvv host.engin.x.edu it useful to debug those problems.\n", "Q: How am I expected to scroll fine distances if I can't change the scroll distance or middle-click and drag to scroll? I can't find anything for this, I use a dell USB mouse, no special buttons or hardware, I regularly need to be able to scroll by couple-pixel distances, mostly in chrome, but for my sanity the ability to do it in everything else would be extremely helpful, according to other questions I found, I can't just change the number of scroll lines and the middle-click scroll is apparently taken up by xclipboard or something,\nWhat do I do? I've run out of ideas, I just came from windows, where this was solved by autoscroll on middle-click and drag, and the ability of my laptop in particular to scroll by 1 pixel in any direction by using the numberpad arrows system-wide.\n\nA: Do you want to Increase Mouse-key acceleration?\nFirstly open a terminal window and type the following to install the xkbset package:\nsudo apt-get install xkbset\n\nA simple one line command can then be used to configure the acceleration:\nxkbset ma [delay] [interval] [time to max] [max speed] [curve]\n\nFor those new to command-line interfaces, the brackets imply that they need to be replaced by a numerical value, tailored to suite a particular use.

Unfortunately setting a low step size will not provide a very fast maximum speed, so you may need to sacrifice your keyboard to perform small scrolls, and keep your mouse for general scrolling.\nThe app suggested by Tim is likely to be more useful.\nAnother option is this Auto Scroll Keys userscript (which I have worked on but did not initially create).  But that's not trivial to install if you don't already have TamperMonkey.\nSome discussion about adjusting Firefox scroll speed can be found here.  You should be able to reduce the speed using the same techniques.\nGnome-wide settings are also discussed on that page, but unfortunately the feature doesn't appear to be available just yet (2015).\n", "Q: How do I copy a package from Debian to my PPA? I'd like to add the latest gourmet package from Debian sid to our team's PPA so Ubuntu users who would like to run an up-to-date version of Gourmet can add that PPA to their software sources. (Dependency-wise, that shouldn't be much of an issue as pretty much all our current dependencies are already available in all currently supported Ubuntu versions.)\nI've downloaded the *.dsc file and debian and orig tarballs, and even figured out I could use this for the package's source.changes file. I also downloaded the Debian maintainer's public key so dput can validate the package. I then tried to upload the package to our PPA using dput ppa:~gourmet/ppa gourmet_0.17.3-1_source.changes (I also tried without the tilda.)\nThis seemed to succeed, but I didn't get a confirmation email, and no packages are now displayed at our PPA, which leads me to believe that the package was rejected because the Debian maintainer's key is obviously not among our team members' keys.\nSo what's the easiest way to \"copy\" a package from Debian (sid) to a Launchpad PPA? Do I really need to rebuild the entire package locally before I can upload it?\n\nA: There are a few ways to do this.\nWhen I did this for Rhythmbox I followed the following receipe:\na. Take the source file and the debian files\n\nb. Uncompress the source (.orig.tar.xz)\nc. rename the source folder something like rhythmbox-3.0.3\nc. uncompress the debian file (.debian.tar.xz)\nd. move the debian folder under the source directory\ne.  dch -i to change the changelog file\nf. change the \"unstable\" package name to the name of the ubuntu target - here I've used precise for 12.04.  Change the version as appropriate for your app.  Here rhythmbox was 3.0.3 - so I've just added -1~ppafossfreedom\nrhythmbox (3.0.3-1~ppafossfreedom) precise; urgency=low\n\n  * rebuild\n\n -- fossfreedom <fossfreedom@somewheremail.com>  Thur, 07 Jun 2012 13:19:18 +0100\n\ng. create a new source package: dh_build --createorig\nh.

Though since backporting a package is a pretty common task, this has been scripted. Check out the backportpackage  command ubuntu-dev-tools  package.\nTo backport a package from Debian, simply provide the target distro series, PPA, and the dsc file for the package:\nbackportpackage -d trusty -u ppa:gourmet/ppa http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/gourmet/gourmet_0.17.3-1.dsc\n\nIt's even simpler to backport a package from one Ubuntu release to another since you don't need to find the dsc file. Let's say we want to backport from utopic to trusty:\nbackportpackage -s utopic -d trusty -u ppa:gourmet/ppa gourmet\n\n", "Q: BCM4331 wireless causes graphics corruption on MacBook Pro 10,2 I have a MacBook Pro 10,2 and just installed 14.04. Everything seems okay except when I enable the wireless driver for the BCM4331 I get intermittent graphics corruption. It looks like the screen loses horizontal sync. If I disable the driver, the graphics looks great. Has anyone else seen this? \n\nA: This is not a straight forward answer, but I'll list the options you have.\nFirst you must identify whether this is a hardware fault or a software fault. To do that, you need to install a screen recorder like Kazaam from Ubuntu software center and see whether you can capture this screen flickering to a video file.  If the recorded video has the flickering, then this is a software related issue.\nSoftware related issues occur mostly because of drivers.\nFirst search additional drivers in Ubuntu dash and see whether you have proprietary drivers available to install.\n \nYou can try to re install the BCM4331 driver.

You should look for tutorials on doing this (it's full of them...). I'd recommend to install win xp first, and then ubuntu. That's because of GRUB as a loader with which you can select the OS to boot (ubuntu, win xp). But if you first install ubuntu and then win, the win boot will re-write the MBR and GRUB will be erased. In consecuence, you won't be able to boot in ubuntu unless you repair GRUB... it's kind of messy.\n4) I'm not sure, sorry I can't help with this one.\n", "Q: 14.04 64 bit memory use When I start the OS I have half of the memory used (1Gb) and now with chromium open this is the output of free:\npiero@piero-Vostro-400:~$ free\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       2039100    1462192     576908     195168      53136     672424\n-/+ buffers/cache:     736632    1302468\nSwap:      2084860          0    2084860\n\nWith thunderbird open and editing a libreoffice document the hard disk starts swapping continuously and the OS becomes really slow with a lot of freezes:\npiero@piero-Vostro-400:~$ free\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       2039100    1962188      76912     309484      29264     919964\n-/+ buffers/cache:    1012960    1026140\nSwap:      2084860          0    2084860\n\nWhat I can do?

I see there are discussions addressing installing software using the USC (as well as some comparisons to the Add/Remove Programms feature in Windows), but nothing regarding how one goes about deleting/uninstalling software (such as Google Chrome) that was not installed using the USC (and therefore, is listed in neither the USC nor is it present in the Installed list in Unity).\n\nA: The Software Center is basically a front-end for the apt package manager. So, if you install a package using apt in the terminal or synaptics (which is also a graphical interface for apt), you'll also find this in the USC and can uninstall it there. It may happen that you have to click on the bottom line \"also show technical packages\" (or similar) when searching for something for some programs to appear in the USC.\nIf you install software that does not come as a .deb package but as a script (install.sh for example), hopefully the script also sets up a new script (mostly called uninstall.sh) that will uninstall this software. I think the ATI graphics driver from the ATI website does (or did) that.\nNote that the second way requires you to trust that the developer set up the install and uninstall script correctly, otherwise it may happen that not all files are removed.\nThe message of this is: If you can, use your package manager to install software. This means in the case of Ubuntu, use .deb files, the USC/Synaptics or apt itself. You can even mix them the way you want. They all are built on top of apt, which is the important thing here. \n\nA: To remove from commandline:\nsudo apt-get remove google-chrome then sudo apt-get autoremove should achieve what you want.\nYou need to know the package name - normally the command you use to execute it from terminal.\n\nA: If Chrome was downloaded as a .deb file, open it with the USC and click \"Re-install\".

The only exception will be any references / symlinks to other partitions, including the swap partition in fstab, which you can easily edit and replace with the UUIDs of such partitions on the second disk.\n\n", "Q: nginx.conf not properly restarting We had altered our nginx.conf file to redirect all urls to their www alternatives. Later, we removed the lines responsible for this functionality. However, even after running sudo service nginx restart, the www redirect continues.\nStrangely, even when we run sudo service nginx stop, the nginx server continues serving. According to service nginx status, nginx is not running. However, when I run ps -ef |grep nginx, there's a line:\ndeploy    1473  1251  0 12:58 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto nginx\n\nWhen I try to kill this with kill -9 1473, I get the error:\n-bash: kill: (1473) - No such process\n\nRunning ps -ef |grep nginx again, I see:\ndeploy    1478  1251  0 12:59 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto nginx\n\nThe pid has changed.\nAny idea what's going on?\n\nA: It's not running.

Your modem is device /dev/ttyUSB0. Minicom is failing because it is trying to open /dev/modem/. Change the device in the minicom settings or run:\nminicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nA more creative solution would be to add a udev rule that creates the /dev/modem symlink automatically.

Other than using xdotool is there a way to scroll down by a set amount using a command. In other words, what is the scrolling command?\nI'm not looking for a keyboard shortcut, I want a command for scrolling by say 10px in the currently focussed window. I also don't want xdotool because I need the \"deeper command\", what is \"executed\" when the wheel is rolled.\n\nA: Not exactly what you asked for, because the OP asked for \"10px\" scrolling, but since it also asked for \"what is executed when the wheel is rolled\".  In Linux, when the wheel is rolled, it's up to the application to interpret it, but you can still simulate wheel rolling.\nWheel rolling up and down are typically mapped as mouse button 4 and 5 respectively.  The following command will simulate scrolling up\nxdotool click 4\n\nand the following command will simulate scrolling down\nxdotool click 5\n\nUse custom shortcuts or scripts to bind your input events to this command to simulate a wheel roll.\n\nA: xdotool lets you send keyboard keys too so all the standard stuff like:\nxdotool key Page_Down\nxdotool key Down Down Down  # presses down three times with a 12ms delay\nxdotool key --delay 2 Down Down Down  # as above but 2ms\n\n\nWith respect to the \"deeper command\", there's no one such thing. A window is sent an event (like a mousewheel) and it (the program or —more commonly— its toolkit) decides how to interpret that.\nThe scrolling isn't directly controllable (unless you're using an application or framework that provides an interface for doing just that). I've explained this a little bit more in your last question.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n\n*Get mouse pointer location:\nxdotool getmouselocation\n\n\n\n*Scroll using click 4 & 5 (change XXX and YYY from above command):\nxdotool mousemove XXX YYY click 4\n\nxdotool mousemove XXX YYY click 5\n\nSource: https://askubuntu.com/a/329009/536195\n\nA: Scroll backwards: \nShift + Page Up\n\nScroll Forwards:\nShift + Page Down\n\n", "Q: Got NODATA issue: 'NODATA' (does the network require authentication?)

The comment above tipped me off to experiment with the network settings.  Once I changed from the default NAT to Bridged my problem was solved.\n\nA: I ran into the same issue after I added a ppa (Dropbox) refering to a domain which is blocked by my company's proxy (*.dropbox.com).  Since apt-get update can't read http://linux.dropbox.com/ubuntu, it throws this \"NODATA\" error.  \nI ended up removing the ppa:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dropbox.list\n\n\nA: This can also occur when apt-get is configured to use a proxy that doesn't exist (duh!). In my case, I moved a machine that was on a proxy network but forgot to remove the apt-get proxy configuration in this file:\n/etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nTo my credit I had removed the environment variable entries (also see here) but simply forgot about the apt-get configuration file.\n\nA: Your mobile broadband provider is running a faulty transparent proxy. The URL http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/InRelease should return \"404 Not Found\". Instead it returns  \"200 OK\" but sends 404 content. Since the URL is \"OK\", apt copies the content to /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/extras.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_trusty_InRelease and attempts to use it, and then complains that it is incorrect.\nThe problem here is not Ubuntu, it is the transparent proxy of your mobile broadband provider.

I think my ISP also uses a rather nasty proxy. \nWhile the solution proposed by bain might be the Right Thing To Do (TM), I found a more immediate and practical solution on the Linux Mint forum which basically involves removing the potentially broken entries from the /var/lib/apt/lists directory (or rather, the directory entirely):\n$ cd /var/lib/apt\n$ sudo mv lists lists.old\n$ sudo mkdir -p lists/partial\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\nThese commands fixed the problem for me.\n\nA: I had the same problem, it turned out to be my ISP's content controls messing with my server's DNS requests.  One angry call to them got the controls disabled, and my dns returned to normal after a router reset.\n\nA: Running into the same issue here I found out that our firewall is interfering by means of 'application control'.

Maybe not related, but freeing up some space solved this issue. apt-get was showing \"no space left on device\" issue though.\n\nA: Recently the university where the server lies has dismissed the proxy.

And is there a more elegant way to know what process is using the port 8080 (not just if it's being used), if any?\n\nA: lsof -i :<portnumnber> should be able to do something along the lines of what you want.\n\nA: While flushing the output to /dev/null is probably the easiest way, sometimes /dev/null has file permissions set so that non-root cannot flush the output there. So, another non-root way to do this is by\ncommand | grep -m 1 -o \"abc\" | grep -o \"123\"\n\nThis double-grep setup finds the matching lines with abc in them and since -o is set ONLY abc is printed and only once because of -m 1. Then the output which is either empty or abc is sent to grep to find only the parts of the string which match 123 and since the last command only outputs abc the empty string is returned. Hope that helps!\n\nA: To hide the output of any command usually the stdout and stderr are redirected to /dev/null.\ncommand > /dev/null 2>&1\n\nExplanation:\n1.command > /dev/null: redirects the output of command(stdout) to /dev/null\n2.2>&1: redirects stderr to stdout, so errors (if any) also goes to /dev/null\nNote\n&>/dev/null: redirects both stdout and stderr to /dev/null. one can use it as an alternate of /dev/null 2>&1\nSilent grep: grep -q \"string\" match the string silently or quietly without anything to standard output. It also can be used to hide the output.\nIn your case, you can use it like,\nif dpkg -s net-tools > /dev/null 2>&1; then\n    if  netstat -tlpn | grep 8080 | grep java > /dev/null 2>&1; then\n    #rest thing\nelse\n    echo \"your message\"\nfi\n\nHere the if conditions will be checked as it was before but there will not be any output.\nReply to the comment:\nnetstat -tlpn | grep 8080 | grep java > /dev/null 2>&1: It is redirecting the output raised from grep java after the second pipe. But the message you are getting from netstat -tlpn. The solution is use second if as,\nif  [[ `netstat -tlpn | grep 8080 | grep java` ]] &>/dev/null; then\n\n", "Q: How to fix Ubuntu partition?

Well, it's not!\nPlease, can anyone help me recover the data?\n\nA: Unfortunately it seems you accidentally partitioned your whole drive replacing your Windows partitions with a single Ubuntu partition.\n\nYou will not be able to recover these partitions by restoring Vista with the recovery CD. In fact every write attempt to your hard drive will make things worse as remnants of your data may get more and more overwritten.\nEncrypted partitions can not be recovered\n\nYou may however be able to recover your partitions with testdisk  but you may not be able to recover all of your data. You can temporarily install testdisk on a live session too (however this will then not be a permanent installation).\n\n\n*\n\n*Please have an external drive ready to save your recovered data before you proceed.

From the command line we can issue:\ncopy -a /<mountpoint_source>/* /media/ubuntu/<name_destination>\n\nAfter sucessful copy we need to unmount the drives to avoid data loss. This will be done in Nautilus from a right click context menu or on the command line:\nsudo umount /media/ubuntu/<name>\n\n\nCopy single files using testdisk\nIn case we were unable or did not want to recover the partition table we may try to copy selected files or directories with testdisk from the <Advanced> Filesystem Utils menu:\n\nIn above example I had selected examples.desktop and rsynctest folder by pressing  : . To copy these files we press  C  for the next menu giving the file hierarchy of our running system.

The content of our USB is now listed, and can be browsed for deeper directories:\n\nWhen we press  C  in the example above our above selected example.desktop, and the folder rsynctest will be copied to the external USB drive.\nTo verify we had succeeded we can now open Nautilus in our live system and see the content of the rescued files.

I've done both hardware and software tech support so I'm not an idiot when it comes to technology. However, I am totally new to linux boxes and hooking up to a TV... Figured it would not give me much difficulties... I was wrong... :(\nI'm working on setting up my first media PC (it is a custom built box from my old company that they were going to throw away) running ubuntu 13.10 and I'm having issues connecting it to my VIZIO E601i-A3 TV.\nHere is some hardware info on the media pc: \nProcessor: Pentium(R) Dual-Core CPU ES200 @ 2.50GHz x 2 \nGraphics: Gallium 0.4 on AMD CEDAR Sapphire Radeon HD 5450 1 GB DDR3 HDMI/DVI-I/VGA PCI-Express Graphics Card 100292DDR3L \nOS: Ubuntu 13.10 - 64-bit\nReceiver: DENON AVR-931\nTrying to connect to a VIZIO E601i-A3 TV.\nMy box runs with a regular monitor but when I plug it in via HDMI to my receiver to my TV, nothing shows up on the TV.

I plugged in my media pc into the \"DVD\" hdmi port and selected that on the receiver and I get no signal. Since I know the \"Game\" port works, I tried there too, with no success.\nIn display settings it recognizes the TV as, \"DENON, Ltd. 60\"\" So it knows it is there, and knows how big it is.\nI'm thinking it is a driver issue?\nI am able to change resolutions but still nothing pops up on the TV. I've tried the classic restart, of everything.\nI have tried googling the issue but my googling skills are currently failing me.  I've also posted this to reddit with no help :(\nAny help would be appreciated.\nI'll also continue to update this with updates on things I've tried.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: 1) You want to use a proprietary driver instead of the open-source gallium driver. See here. \n2) If your system is still unable to obtain and set a proper modeline via EDID, you can easily do so using the 3 terminal commands shown here (cvt and xrandr) with the display connected DIRECTLY to the video card.

(although it was still released as part of the desktop ISO after that -and maybe still is-). Installing Ubuntu inside windows in Win8 or up will certaily fail (as per the  official Wubiguide). But trying this -even if you are using windows 7 or lower- is just going to be a minefield. I recommend against it. There are alternatives, like installing a virtual machine in your windows OS (like Oracle Virtualbox), and install Ubuntu 14.04 on that.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Wubi is discontinued. While new versions of Ubuntu do still include a wubi.exe file, it has been modified to display a message asking you to perform a native installation, and will not allow you to perform a wubi installation regardless of what operating system you are using.

And then you have to manually create your own partitions, minimum is efi as FAT32 with boot flag, / (root) as ext4 and swap not format, but lots of discussion of swap on SSD, so if you have lots of RAM you may not need it or even use it. I usually like to have a little like 2GB.\nAnd best to create an efi partition first on drive if UEFI or or bios_grub partition if BIOS.

I personally have never heard of or seen this OS and am pretty confused by it, after spending all day trying to log into it, i finally go in but now i cant seem to update it to the newest version. Please help this noob update his new laptop.\n\nA: There are two types of Ubuntu release:\n\n\n*\n\n*Long Term Support (LTS herein) which are released every 2 years\n\n*Standard released every 6 months (when it's not an LTS release)\n\n\nLTS releases can be upgraded to the next LTS or the next standard release. Standard releases can only upgrade to the next release.\n9.04 was a standard release and the next LTS is 10.04. Your only upgrade path is:\n\n\n*\n\n*9.04 → 9.10\n\n*9.10 → 10.04 LTS\n\n*10.04 LTS → 12.04 LTS (you could stop here)\n\n*12.04 LTS → 14.04 LTS (the current release)\n\n\nThe problem is 9.04, 9.10 and even 10.04 LTS are all so old that they're unsupported and their repositories (which you need to update with) have been shut off.\nYou can fight this and upgrade... But you'll need to do at least two upgrades to get to a supported release (12.04 LTS is supported until 2017). That's a fair amount of bandwidth and time.\nI'd honestly be looking at downloading Ubuntu, \"burning\" the ISO to a USB stick and just reinstalling (after making sure 14.04 works on your system). You'll get the benefit of stock settings (rather than a hodge-podge you've been left with) and with a decent internet connection, the full process only takes about an hour. Much quicker than an upgrade\n", "Q: I am unable to see anything on the screen while using any version of Ubuntu Every time i install Ubuntu either 12.10 or any version of Linux mint it install well but i cannot be able to see anything on the screen on when i use a DESKTOP screen by connecting on a VGA that time i see from a different screen.\n\nA: Based on the card you've listed I'm assuming you are using a laptop with an external vga monitor, and at boot up both screens are black. I have what sounds like the same problem with my laptop, and I've found two work-arounds for it. These may or may not work for you.\nOption #1:\nIf their is a proprietary driver that can be installed for your card that may fix it. For example I have AMD graphics so installing fglrx-updates fixes it for me. I'm not familiar with your specific card so I don't if there are drivers for it, but I found a tool made by Intel. You can see a list of supported cards by the tool here: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?DwnldID=13815 . The tool can be downloaded from: https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads .\nOption #2:\nDon't plug the vga cable into your laptop until after you've logged in. Then go to your settings and enable the vga monitor. What happens for me is the computer turns off the laptop monitor as it boots up, because it thinks the vga monitor is going to be used, but the vga monitor doesn't get used because Ubuntu is configured to clone display 1 to display 2 by default and display 1 is currently off.\n", "Q: Num Lock key triggers tab? I recently installed Kubuntu 14.04 and ever since then didn't get my Num Pad to work. I have a Samsung Laptop with a Num Pad (not in a higher layer on the main board, but next to it).

But when I try to activate the Numbers by hitting Num Lock, nothing happens. Instead, it writes a Tabulator in any text editor. In terminal, it activates the command completion, so it seems to be a real tab signal. \nIt might be an issue with the german NEO layout that I have set up as default, but switching to a different layout didn't help. And yes, I made sure that the option \"control mouse cursor with arrow keys\" is disabled.\nI have no idea what the problem is. Any ideas?\n\nA: Try remapping your Num lock in the following way it might work for you. Follow the steps exactly.\nKnow how your system sees those keys, using the command xev and pressing the keys whose id you want to discover.After entering the xev just press page up and then press alt+t then you will get the following results. Then use the key code you got on pressing alt+t keys in the command at the end. that's all it will be done. I did this on my laptop and got the below results and so i gave it for reference only. You have to perform action to get your own result as these results vary with computer.\nPressing Up produces keycode 111, assigned to action Up:\nKeyPress event, serial 34, synthetic NO, window 0x3a00001,\nroot 0xa5, subw 0x0, time 13739005, (165,-16), root(170,32),\nstate 0x0, keycode 111 (keysym 0xff52, Up), same_screen YES,\nXLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXFilterEvent returns: False\n\nPressing Pg Up key gives the following:\nKeyPress event, serial 32, synthetic NO, window 0x2400001,\nroot 0xc3, subw 0x0, time 13714833, (61,151), root:(63,236),\nstate 0x10, keycode 112 (keysym 0xff55, Prior), same_screen YES,\nXLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXFilterEvent returns: False\n\nOnce you know the keycode of the keys you would like to use, and the name of the actions you want to perform, you can assign the desired actions to the chosen keys.\nThe following four commands will produce the desired change, valid only for the present X session:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 112 = Up\"\n\nTo get these changes for every session, after issuing the commands above, create a file called .Xmodmap (or whatever), with the following command:\nxmodmap -pke > .Xmodmap\n\nThen, create a file called .xinitrc in your home directory, containing just the following line:\nxmodmap .Xmodmap\n\nRefer to the site for any doubts: http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/...txkbmap_Method\n", "Q: Unable to connect to mail server via IMAP and roundcube I am having trouble getting the final parts of my mail server up and working.

(connect two monitors to 1 DisplayPort) I am planning to use Surface Pro 2 with a dock station as my main computer and I would like to connect two external monitors to it, but the dock station only contains a single DisplayPort socket. However, I see that DisplayPort 1.2 specification, approved in 2009, allows for daisy-chaining monitors through its Multi-Stream Transport feature.\nHow do I tell if I will be able to use two monitors in daisy-chain mode with my computer?\n\nA: Daisy chain support is in stable Linux kernel now.\nPlease see my answer\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/552094/349788\nIf Surface Pro has Intel graphics abroad then chain is likely to work at new Linux kernel and latest video drivers.\n\nA: Update: As of July 8, 2014, DisplayPort MST support does not exist in any Linux kernel. David Airlie at Red Hat is working on it, and his work is being merged in Linux kernel 3.17. The upcoming Ubuntu 14.10 \"Utopic Unicorn\" will use 3.16, so DisplayPort MST support \"out-of-the-box\" is not expected on Ubuntu until 15.04 (yes, nearly a year from now). I will update this answer with instructions on installing the patch set yourself when I figure out how do it and I will have the hardware supporting MST. I have postponed my purchase of Surface Pro 2 due to personal circumstances, so anyone who has MST hardware and Surface Pro 2 is very welcome to go ahead and install a patch set and try it out and/or help Michael debug it, to assure that when the patch does arrive, it will work well on SP2, as right now MST support seems to be tested on Thinkpad T440s and 4K monitors.\nYou should be able to use two monitors, one way or the other, unless Microsoft relies on some secret sauce (software, firmware or hardware) that won't work with Ubuntu.\nSurface Pro 2 ships with either i5-4200U or i5-4300U CPU, both Haswell chips with HD Graphics 4400 GPU. According to Intel, these chips have 4th generation graphics (HD Graphics 4200 and up is 4th, 4000 and 2500 is 3rd) and thus support DisplayPort 1.2.\nApart from graphics adapter support, you will need compatible monitors. These monitors should be DisplayPort 1.2 compatible and feature two DisplayPorts (for input and output). According to this page from DisplayPort.org (click 'DP Displays Multi-Stream' then 'Search') there are currently seven such models:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lenovo LT2934z\n\n*Asus PA279Q\n\n*Dell U2413\n\n*Dell U2414H\n\n*Dell U2713H\n\n*Dell U2913WM\n\n*Dell U3014\nOr, you could use DisplayPort 1.2 MST hub like this one: not quite daisy-chain, but a solution to connect up to 3 DisplayPort monitors to a single DP 1.2 MST output. The monitors can be regular old-school DP 1.0, according to this answer.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Youtube app not working I installed the youtube app (unity-webapps-youtube) from ubuntu software center.

I transcribe them here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install build-essential, tix, foomatic-filters, groff, dc FIRST:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential tix foomatic-filters groff dc\n\n\n*Unpack:\nwget -O foo2zjs.tar.gz http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/foo2zjs.tar.gz\ntar zxf foo2zjs.tar.gz\ncd foo2zjs\n\n\n*Compile:\nmake\n\n\n*Get extra files from the web, such as .ICM profiles (for color correction) and firmware.  Select the model number for your printer, In this case:\n./getweb 1018      # Get HP LaserJet 1018 firmware file\n\n\n*Install driver, foomatic XML files, PPD files, and extra files:\nsudo make install\n\n\n*Install hotplug (for HP LJ 1000/1005/1018/1020/P100[5678]/P1505):\nsudo make install-hotplug\n\nUnplug and re-plug the USB printer\n\n\n*If you use CUPS to manage your printers, you must restart cupsd:\nsudo make cups\n\n\n\n*Add a new printer by pasting http://localhost:631 in your browser address field and adding a new printer. Once created it, print a test page.\nIn my case I experienced problems using cups, so I reinstalled it with\nsudo apt-get -y install cups\n\nNOTE: \nI suggest to watch the log /var/log/syslog to detect any possible error.\nFor example, after installing foo2zjs, I detect the following error in syslog:\nfoo2zjs: Missing HP LaserJet 1018 firmware file /lib/firmware/hp/sihp1018.dl\n\nSo, I fixed it by getting the firmware:\ngetweb 1018\n\nThen I copied the file sihp1018.dl to the directory specified in the syslog error.\nYou may need to reboot both the computer and the printer.\nAfter these steps I was able to print using the HP LaserJet 1018 printer without problems, I did different tests like print a test page, print a LibreOffice doc, print a PDF doc. I reboot the machine and printed again and the printer worked perfectly.\nI tested using both Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10.\nHope this can help.\n", "Q: Does pip overwrite packages installed by apt-get? What happens if I accidentally pip install a package that I already installed using apt-get beforehand? Do I simply get to use the latest version (i.e. probably the one I installed using pip)? What happens the other way round?\nNote: I do not use Python in a virtual environment (simply because I don't know why I should -- I use Python as a data analysis tool and mostly try to use the latest version of everything).\n\nA: As @Timo mentioned in his comment, python -c \"import sys; print sys.path\" will give you the Python module load path for your install of Python. On a relatively fresh install of 16.04, there are three directories of note (among the 10 total that were in mine):\n\n\n*\n\n*'' (application's directory)\n\n*'/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' (where pip installs modules)\n\n*'/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' (where apt install modules)\n\n\nMost important to note, however, is that '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' is HIGHER in precedence than '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages'.\nIf you first install a Python package via apt(-get), it will install into '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages'. If you later try and use pip to install the module, pip will initially give a warning that the dependency is already met, then exit; adding the --upgrade flag will force pip to install, installing the module into '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages'. (Notice the output that also says that the version in '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' is not uninstalled) You can then verify that the pip-installed version is the one being used by using the following: python -c \"import MODULE; print MODULE.__file__\".\nAs such, this shows that packages installed via pip will take precedence over system-installed packages, but won't overwrite anything installed from apt(-get).\n\nA: To add to @Bryan Wyatt, it seems desirable (and intended) that PIP installed/upgraded items should take precedence over (likely older) APT installed packages.  My system had the apt and pip paths reversed.  It should be (ignoring other entries):\n\n\n*\n\n*'/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' (where pip installs modules)\n\n*'/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' (where apt install modules)\n\n\nYet due to some unknown action I must have taken, these paths appeared in the opposite order for me (ignoring other entries):\n\n\n*\n\n*'/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' (where apt install modules)\n\n*'/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' (where pip installs modules)\n\n\nIt turns out something I did added /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/easy-install.pth.  Simply removing the line from easy-install.pth fixed the misordering for me. /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages is still in my path, since it gets added at a later stage elsewhere.\nAs a side note, pprint will display your path nicer...ie: \n$ python -c \"import sys; import pprint; pprint.pprint(sys.path)\"\n['',\n '/usr/lib/python2.7',\n '/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu',\n '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk',\n '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old',\n '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload',\n '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages',\n '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages',\n '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PILcompat',\n '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtk-2.0',\n '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ubuntu-sso-client']\n\n", "Q: I lost Thunderbird from the Launcher and can't get it back I am new to Ubuntu, am not very tech savey, and a couple of days ago I installed Kontack on my Ubuntu. About half way through the install my thunderbird icon disappeared from the Launcher on the desktop. I've been searching for where it went and how to restore it to my desktop sdince then with no luck. Can you help me find my Thunderbird program and re-set it on my launcher as my default email program?\nThanks\n\nA: Go to Systems Settings -> Details -> select Default Applications from the pane on left side -> click the little black arrow to the right of Mail and select Thunderbird from the dropdown menu to change the default mail application to Thunderbird.\n\nThen search in the Dash for Thunderbird and open Thunderbird. The Thunderbird icon will appear on the Launcher. Right-click the Thunderbird icon on the Launcher and select Lock to Launcher to make the Thunderbird icon appear on the Launcher permanently.\n", "Q: Nautilus copy/paste suddenly stop working, how to workaround? qdbus? I use ubuntu 14.04. As copy/paste for no reason suddenly fails, since nautilus on ubuntu 12.10, I am looking for a workaround.  \nThe workaround can be any trick you came by. I have several (10+) tabs opened and there is NO WAY to close and open nautilus with all them back opened? if there is, this would be a workaround! I, at least, could find no way even with qdbus (may be I dont know how to use it very well).\nIn case you know what causes this problem, I would like to know too, but not required.\nI was thinking, if I could collect all tab locations thru, may be, qdbus, I could create a script to re-open them on a new nautilus window.\nPS.: you can help too by following @isync suggestion at comments below!\n\nA: A workaround i found is to restart nautilus\nnautilus -q\n\nThen open Files and now copy/paste should work.\nI have checked this in Ubuntu 14.04 and it's working.\n\nA: You shouldn't try a \"workaround\" if you would have to mess with config files. This is clearly a bug and it has been filed already.\nCan you copy files if you drag them with the mouse while holding CTRL (a little \"+\" should appear beside the icon of the file you are dragging)?\nAlso try to start nautilus from a terminal (by writing nautilus) to see if it writes any error messages. Also try starting nautilus with sudo from a terminal: sudo nautilus and try if it works then (can be  a permission issue if it does). However, NEVER use sudo nautilus for your regular work, even if it works as it is a security risk.\nAs a last resort because you will have to wait for the bug to be fixed you can try another file manager, e.g. Nemo which is a fork of Nautilus or Thunar.\n\nA: This a Nautilus bug, you can check it here.\n\nA: I'm using the file manger Nemo on Ubuntu 14.04 and got the same problem. Copy, Cut and Paste suddenly stopped working.\nAfter closing all file manager windows and reopen them it worked again.\n\nA: An interesting workaround can be found here.\nIt basically makes symlinks to nautilus tabs folders at a /tmp,\nrestarts nautilus at that backup folder,\nselect all folders symlinks,\nand open them all as tabs with \"ctrl+shift+t\".\n#the list of open tabs least current one (dup it prior):  \nqdbus org.gnome.Nautilus /org/freedesktop/FileManager1 org.freedesktop.FileManager1.OpenLocations\n# use it to create a folder with symlinks pointing to them\n\n# after opening nautilus on that folder directly\n# select all of the symlinks and open'em on new tabs\n\n\nA: I have the same problem. My solution was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Nautilus from a command prompt and, for me, it work fine; \n\n*Close Nautilus;\n\n*Open Nautilus normally from the Desktop, and this now works fine.\n\n"]
