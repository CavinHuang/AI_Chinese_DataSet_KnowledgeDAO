["Q: How to install node 0.10.40 on Ubuntu 14.04 I'm trying to follow this instruction (from How to Install the Latest Versions of NodeJS and NPM for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS):\napt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 68576280\napt-add-repository \"deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_5.x $(lsb_release -sc) main\"\napt-get update\napt-get install nodejs\n\nWhere it is mentioned that I can replace that URL with a different repository. I need a version greater than 0.10.37 - which is the max version the chris-lea repository seems to provide - but lower than 5.x. (I have removed the chris-lea repository).\nHowever, I'm not at all sure what the URL actually has to refer to, when looking at this link:\nhttps://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.40/\nThen, when I try to install node v0.12 with these commands:\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nI get 0.10.25.\nHow can I either: remove all traces of node from apt-get so that I can install it manually, or update the apt-get repository details to get the correct version?\n\nA: I found a set of scripts and needed to fix it to work. Source here: https://gist.github.com/msporny/5019c4bed5415b745edd\n1) Setup apt for 0.10\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.10 | sudo bash -\n2) Find the exact version you have setup\napt-cache policy nodejs\n3) Install that version of 0.10.

I can run it correctly when running the executable file. However, I think that this is not a well suited directory, and I would like to know where would be the best place to move it. \nI read in some posts that portable apps may be installed at /opt, but I am not sure that it would be my case.\n\nA: I don't believe there is an objectively chosen place to put portable apps. They are portable, after all.\nThe best thing to do with any portable app is to move it and its files into a directory and put that directory somewhere you know it won't be accidentally deleted. Definitely do not keep it in Downloads, especially if you regularly delete items from there.\nIf you want it to be easily accessible, put the folder containing the app on your desktop. It probably won't be accidentally deleted, and it'll be right there to click on. You can even make a link to the executable if you want even more convenience. You could also put the folder in your documents.\nAs far as I know, Ubuntu doesn't have designated space for portable apps. Just put them where they won't be removed.\n", "Q: Why apache is unable to write with permission set as 2775? I have installed LAMP as:\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install lamp-server^\n\nIf I understand correctly, apache server will be running with sudo privileges? If yes, for a php script to be able to write in its own directory does it only require RWX for root user?\nIt doesn't work for me. I have to give 777 privileges to the directory and the script for it write a new file into the particular directory. I do not understand, how is it functioning. Why cannot the apache, that is running as root able to write when 2775 have been set up earlier?\nI had earlier given permissions as : (using shell commands)\ngroupadd www;\nusermod -a -G www $(whoami);\nadduser $(whoami) sudo;\ndefault_conf_file_path=\"/etc/apache2/sites-available/\";\ndefault_conf_file=$default_conf_file_path\"000-default.conf\";\nDocumentRoot=$(grep \"DocumentRoot\"  $default_conf_file);\nDocumentRoot=${DocumentRoot#*/};\nDocumentRoot=/$DocumentRoot;\nchown -R root:www $DocumentRoot;\nchmod 2775 $DocumentRoot;\nfind $DocumentRoot -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \\;\nfind $DocumentRoot -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \\;\n\n\nA: you need to add \"www-data\" user into your newly created group \"www\" using (gpasswd -a www-data www)\n", "Q: linux-image-generic vs linux-image-x.x.x-xx-generic security updates I have an Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit server running with unattended-upgrades set up to only install security upgrades. I have the linux-image-generic and linux-headers-generic packages installed and am getting too many kernel versions installed. \nWould removing these meta-packages and installing specific kernel packages eg linux-image-3.2.0-101-generic stop the installation of newer kernel versions and what effect would this have on security i.e. would this package without the meta-package linux-image-generic still get security updates?\n\nA: The metapackage exists to refer to the existing version-specific version of the full package.  For example, linux-image-generic will point to linux-image-3.2.0-101-generic or whatever the latest-updated kernel is.\nThe metapackage is version bumped to point to the latest kernel version with each update.  By installing a specific kernel, and then not relying on the metapackage for your kernel versions and updates, you get no updates.\nEach individual update to the kernel, either a critical bug fix or a security fix, requires a new kernel package to be created, and the metapackage bumped.  There is no way to automatically backport 'fixes' to all the older package versions, as the kernels are considered 'different versions' at that point.\nIf you remove the metapackage and rely only on a specific kernel package, you get no security updates, no bug fixes, and you may actually have difficulty upgrading in the future (if you attempt an in-place upgrade).\nYou should not remove the metapackage, and should keep it in the system.  You also must install new kernel images to get security updates on the kernels.\n\nA: If you remove the meta packages, you will not get any kernel updates.\nAll kernel updates are considered as security updates.\nSo this is not a good idea to remove the meta packages.\nThere is no other way to get a security kernel update, but to install a new kernel image.\nYou can also remove all old kernel image and headers packages, if they take space. They are not used.\n", "Q: RDP to ubuntu server? I have a Ubuntu 14.04 Server and I want to be able to RDP to it with Ubuntu desktop 14.04 installed on it. How do I set up the desktop version of ubuntu in terminal? I tried xrdp but it's not the GUI I want, I want the 14.04 version of the Ubuntu Desktop?\n\nA: You can access your server by the VNC protocol. Immediate access by RDP in a manner like you access windows desktops from windows desktops is not possible.\nShare your desktop\nIn the Dash, open Desktop Sharing.\nTo let others view your desktop, select Allow other users to view your desktop. This means that other people will be able to attempt to connect to your computer and view what's on your screen.\nTo let others interact with your desktop, select Allow other users to control your desktop. This may allow the other person to move your mouse, run applications, and browse files on your computer, depending on the security settings which you are currently using.\nSecurity\nIt is important that you consider the full extent of what each security option means before changing it.\nConfirm access to your machine\nIf you want to be able to choose whether to allow someone to access your desktop, select You must confirm each access to this machine. If you disable this option, you will not be asked whether you want to allow someone to connect to your computer.\nEnable password\nTo require other people to use a password when connecting to your desktop, select Require the user to enter this password. If you do not use this option, anyone can attempt to view your desktop.\nThis option is disabled by default, but you should enable it and set a secure password.\nAllow access to your desktop over the Internet\nIf your router supports UPnP Internet Gateway Device Protocol and it is enabled, you can allow other people who are not on your local network to view your desktop. To allow this, select Automatically configure UPnP router to open and forward ports. Alternatively, you can configure your router manually.\nProblems with encryption\nWhen you try to view your desktop from Windows with i.e. TightVNC you may get failure messages about there is no supported encryption available. You may deactivate encryption on your server by:\nOpen a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false\n\nThen hit Enter.\nThis will disable the requirement of an encrypted connection.\n", "Q: GSview in apt-get? I am trying to search GSview in Linux, but I cannot find it by apt-cache search gsview. \n\nHow can you install gsview in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: There is no package called gsview, so you're not going to find it by searching that way. There is another package that serves the same function as GSView, called gv. \nInstall it by running sudo apt-get install gv.\n\nA: I did sudo apt-get install gv and installed GSView 3.7.4 which is relatively old version. So what I managed to do is to install Ghostscrip 9.21 and GSView 5.0 on wine 64bit version and works perfectly well.\n", "Q: Can I search in the terminal backlog in Terminator I'm using Terminator as my terminal.

I have EduBOSS 4.0 Linux DVD. I was install EduBOSS but its lot of problems I faced. So I decide use Ubuntu only. But I want EduBOSS theme into Ubuntu.\nPlease gives answers for off-line as well on-line EduBOSS theme installation for Ubuntu Unity.   \n\nA: EduBOSS 4.0 uses the GNOME Desktop Environment. If you want something resembling EduBOSS, install GNOME and use it instead of Unity. As for the icons, you'll have to find something you like. The icon theme on EduBOSS appears to be original.\nTo install and use GNOME on your computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop.\n\n*Once that installs, log out.\n\n*Click the gear icon to the right of the Password section.\n\n*Select the Ubuntu GNOME option and log in.\n\n\nYou will now have a desktop that looks like EduBOSS.\n", "Q: How to play media files with Ubuntu when booted from an USB pen drive? I created a bootable pen drive from Ubuntu. When I boot my computer from it I can't open any of my media files such as music & videos. Please tell me how to open these files. \n\nA: You have to install the necessary media plugins.  \nYou need an internet connection to achieve this.  \nTo install the media plugins open a terminal and execute these commands :  \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly  \n\nNow you should be able to open and play most of the common media files.\nIn case you run into problems - make sure that all repositories are enabled :\nsudo add-apt-repository main\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\nsudo add-apt-repository multiverse\nsudo add-apt-repository restricted\n\nNote :  \nThese operations have to be performed every time after you booted again  from the USB drive when you did not create the Ubuntu installation media with a persistent storage functionality.\n", "Q: I set \"PubkeyAuthentication\" to no and I am locked out I am not very familiar with ssh and I am afraid I made a disastrous mistake. \nThere is an old server which used public key authentication. My public key was in the authorized keys, so I was able to access it.

I am sure that I didn't have to give any password for sudo commands\nIs there any way to access the server again?\n\nA: I think the best option here is to reboot the system into single user mode and make configuration changes from there.  (i.e. update the ssh configuration or set a password)  Check here for details on getting into single user mode: How do I boot into single-user mode from GRUB?\n", "Q: PyGIWarning when sudo update-manager -d Do I have some incomplete install?\n$ sudo update-manager -d\nsys:1: PyGIWarning: Gtk was imported without specifying a version first.

I want to run my Linux games on here, then I realized it can't really do much. I am just a geek that wants to tinker with his hardware and operating system.

You can either run a nicely configured ChromeOS installation, or a nice ChromeOS configuration with Crouton to preview what a Linux distribution would look like on a Chromebook.\nIf you want to run a stable Ubuntu distribution on your Chromebook, you will probably have to replace ChromeOS with Ubuntu.\nYou can see whether your Samsung Chromebook is supported by John Lewis' custom BIOS here.\nIf you think you would like to potentially risk bricking your device, you can proceed with the instructions here.\nI used the steps here for a dozen Dell Chromebooks but your instructions may differ because you are using Samsung.\n", "Q: How to make lm sensors return CPU temp (it87)? ,Simply put, I cannot get lm sensors to return my CPU temp.

I've created .desktop files before to create launcher icons but I cannot figure out how to do it with Navicat & the tutorials I've found online for wine applications don't seem to work. I think it's because Navicat has it's own wine directory and doesn't use the one that comes with Ubuntu?\nIt was suggested that this is a duplicate of \"How does one create a custom application launcher for Wine installed apps?\" which I've tried and it hasn't worked.

I'm using the IDLE3 GUI on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty, and I was wondering if anybody knows of a way to save to a different partition/external drive (from what Ubuntu is installed on) from the IDLE GUI?\nThe reason I'm asking is because currently, I'm using IDLE on Ubuntu, but I dual-boot Ubuntu w/ Windows 10 and sometimes use Windows IDLE, and since I can't access anything saved on my Ubuntu partition through Windows, I'd like to be able to save my .py files to an intermediary partition that I can access with both Windows and Ubuntu.\nLet me know if you need anymore information, or clarification.\n\nA: Let's make some wild assumptions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your \"data\" partition partition is ntfs file system for Windows.\n\n*It is not automagically mounted in the Ubuntu system and therefore invisible from within the system.\n\n\nTo make data on the 'data' partition available from within the Ubuntu system the partition needs to be mounted.  It could be mounted as needed, or for convenience can be mounted on system startup.\nUbuntu's Manual Configuration instructions are as follows:\nFirst, you need to find the device locations of the partition(s) you wish to mount. Open a terminal and run:\nsudo blkid\n\nFor illustration purposes, an example output from a computer setup with a Vista/Ubuntu dual-boot and shared NTFS data partition is shown here:\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"Recovery\" UUID=\"B23613F43613B875\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"Windows\" UUID=\"38CE9483CE943AD8\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda3: LABEL=\"Data\" UUID=\"519CB82E5888AD0F\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"00d7d951-2a35-40fd-8e5d-411bb824ff3b\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sda6: LABEL=\"Ubuntu\" UUID=\"6044b1d0-208e-4ab3-850d-03a92e1516fc\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n\nThe first three partitions, all NTFS, are the ones that concern us here. There are no FAT32 partitions. In this instance, all three NTFS partitions have partition labels, which makes it easier to identify the purpose of each. If your blkid output does not include partition labels, this means that the partitions do not have labels and you will have to determine which partition you wish to mount by another means. Of the three NTFS partitions, we are going to configure /etc/fstab with only the third, the Data partition. Partition /dev/sda1 is the OEM manufacturer's recovery partition and should be left unmounted, or as described below. Partition /dev/sda2 is the Windows C:\\ partition and is best not included in /etc/fstab for the reasons described above, or mounted read-only - see below.\nYou will now need to create a mountpoint for each NTFS partition that you wish to mount by means of /etc/fstab. In our illustration we are going to add one entry only for /dev/sda3. From a terminal:\nsudo mkdir /media/Data\n\nIn this case we have created a mountpoint with the same name – Data – as the partition label. You may use (almost) any string you wish.\nBefore editing /etc/fstab directly, it is a good idea to make a backup. From a terminal:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig\n\nNow open /etc/fstab in a text editor with root privileges. In Ubuntu:\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nIn Kubuntu:\nkdesudo kate /etc/fstab\n\nIn Xubuntu or Lubuntu:\ngksudo leafpad /etc/fstab\n\nFor a general-purpose read-write mount, add this line to the end of /etc/fstab:\nUUID=519CB82E5888AD0F  /media/Data  ntfs-3g  defaults,windows_names,locale=en_US.utf8  0 0\n\nReplace the UUID with the one relevant for your partition as shown in your blkid output. “519CB82E5888AD0F” will not work for you.\nAlso, substitute your mountpoint for “/media/Data”. In case you have a blank space in the name of the mountpoint you want to use like \"New Volume\" instead of \"Data\" located in \"/media\" use \"/media/New\\040Volume\". The space character is created by using \"\\040\" in the fstab.\nYou will also need to change the “locale=en_US.utf8” option to one suitable for your location and language if you are not in the USA. You can determine your locale with this terminal command:\nlocale\n\nOr for a list of all locales available on your system:\nlocale -a\n\nNow save your edited /etc/fstab and close the text editor. The partition(s) you have configured will be mounted the next time you reboot, but to mount them now:\nsudo mount -a\n\nNow when you go to save/retrieve your data, written from the Windows system, it will be at the location specified in your /etc/fstab mounting instructions.\nAs a personal preference, rather than have the mount point be /mnt/Data or /media/Data, e.g., I used mount points just off root, /Data e.g.. because it saves 4-5 keystrokes or an extra click.\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 15.10 alongside Windows 10, but it won't boot I'm new to Ubuntu, and I wanted to install it on my laptop (ASUS, running Windows 10 (upgrade from Windows 8.1), Intel i5 processor, 6GB Ram, 300GB storage). \nI followed instructions from the Ubuntu website and made a bootable USB using the Universal USB Installer from pendrivelinux.

When I tried to use:\nsudo sysctl -p\n\nI'm getting an output in the Terminal as:\nsysctl: cannot stat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/disable_ipv6: No such file or directory\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\n\nI have checked the directory and found that the file/directory is present.\nAdditional information: I'm trying to install Apache Hadoop (ver. 2.7.2) in my system. Though all the services are up and running, I am unsure if it will work with my network configuration. Since it is informed (here) that Hadoop doesn't work well with iPv6 connection, so I tried to run:\nsudo sed -i 's/net.ipv6.bindv6only\\ =\\ 1/net.ipv6.bindv6only\\ =\\ 0/' \\/etc/sysctl.d/bindv6only.conf && sudo invoke-rc.d procps restart\n\nWhen I do this, I get a message:\nsed: can't read /etc/sysctl.d/bindv6only.conf: No such file or directory\n\n**There is no such file in the directory when I searched manually.\n\nA: The only thing you need to do, if you really want to do this, is to see to that the inet6 module isn't loaded when the computer reboots.\nJust try this (as root user).\n$ cat >/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ipv6.conf <<EOF\n# Turn of IPv6 by blacklisting the module.\n# Even though it isn't needed.\nblacklist ipv6\n\nEOF\n$\n\nBut really, you shouldn't need to do this. As long as you don't have a IPv6 network in your LAN, it will not interfere with your IPv4 net.\nDon't forget to remove those changes you have added to /etc/sysctl.conf.\n\nA: The Hadoop page you linked to is really not saying that IPv6 will cause you problems. What it is saying will cause you problems is if you turn off IPv4 and try to use IPv6 instead.\nSo, your goal shouldn't be to get rid of IPv6. It should be to leave IPv4 working.\nNow, the page does mention a configuration option that they recommend setting. It has to do with how Hadoop would register with the OS to listen for incoming requests. Ubuntu gives you the option to register to listen for only IPv4 connections, only IPv6, or both.\nSome (older, I'm pretty sure) versions of Debian (which Ubuntu is based on) thought they would try to help apps with the transition, and changed some settings with how what listening setup would work. That setting is what the wiki page you mentioned is referring to. To turn it off, you just need to put the following in the /etc/sysctl.conf file:\nnet.ipv6.bindv6only = 0\n\nand while you are there, remove the lines:\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\n\nThen run sysctl -p and you should be all set.\n", "Q: Partition External HDD For Multiple Bootables I know that there are many sources available online regarding the installation of a bootable Ubuntu on an external HDD.

May at least result in more consistent behavior.\n\n*If you're calling mount or mount.ecryptfs directly you can try the verbose command:\n\nverbose\n              Log  ecryptfs  information  to /var/log/messages.  Do not run eCryptfs in verbose-mode unless you are doing so for the sole purpose of  development,  since\n            secret values will be written out to the system log in that case.\n\n", "Q: Videos requires to install plugins to play files of the following types: • MPEG-4 AAC decoder • H.264 (High Profile) decoder i am unable to perform the task though i followed the instruction. how to handel Unable to locate package ubuntu-restricted-extras?\n\nA: Unable to locate package ubuntu-restricted-extras?\nMake sure that all Ubuntu repositories are enabled.  \nOpen a terminal and execute :\nsudo add-apt-repository main\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\nsudo add-apt-repository multiverse\nsudo add-apt-repository restricted\n\nNow install the packages :\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras  \n\nNote :  \nMaybe the ttf-mscorefonts-installer lets the installation process hang, because the license agreement is hidden in the background.

I installed a light (mini) Version of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a secondary machine. After I got over 7,000 package-dependency errors, I continued the installation and proceeded to install grub on sda1 (however there is only one hard drive).\nIs there a problem, because I installed just a few packages? I didn't know which ones to take.\n\nA: If by \"mini\" version, you mean the image found here, then my guess is that your machine didn't connect to the internet, and didn't pull down the required packages to do an install. \nThe mini.iso and netinstall images require an active internet connection at install time. They contain minimal packages required only to boot, which is why the images are so small.\nYou could re-run the installer and pay close attention to the networking portion to ensure that it's properly connected.\nIf the mini.iso installer doesn't detect your networking devices, you'll have to use one of the larger images to successfully install, since they contain the required packages on disk. \n", "Q: Three finger swipe not working with xswipe I installed xSwipe per instructions on my Dell XPS 13 (9343, early 2015) with Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 .\nLaunching it with $ perl ~/xSwipe-master/xSwipe.pl works fine, but it doesn't detect three-finger touches.\nThat's weird, since my synaptics capabilities are :\nSynaptics Capabilities (325):   1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nso three-finger touches should be detected.\nIs it because xSwipe requires a fall-back to older synaptic drivers?\n\nA: xSwipe is limited, it focuses on swiping, vertical or horizontal, and on multi-finger clicks. There is no support for pinching, rotating or tapping, and there are no application specific gestures. \nIn order for it to work you need to install libx11-guitest-perl\nsudo -i\napt-get update\napt-get install libx11-guitest-perl\n\nIf you already have a synaptics conf file then open it up and check your trackpad section for the line:\nOption \"SHMConfig\" \"on\"\n\nSource & More info\n", "Q: Invalid operation?? after i type sudo apt-get cpufrequtils For so many commands which i type are correct even then i have errors like unable to locate package or sometimes it gives \"invalid operation\" .

To install or remove use...\nsudo apt-get install cpufrequtils\nsudo apt-get remove cpufrequtils\n\n\nA: An more morecent alternative to apt-get is the apt command (see here for a discussion about their differences).\nMaybe using apt you more easily realize that installing isn't the only thing that these tool do. And as such you first have to tell them the operation you want to perform:\nsudo apt install cpufrequtils\n\nWithout the install the command wouldn't know whether you want to install or uninstall that package or if you simply want to search for it.\nThe name apt-get may sound like it only \"gets\"(\"install\") the programs, but this isn't true.\n\nYou should prefer apt for interactive use as it provides a cleaner interface and colorized human friendly output.

The annoying thing is that sound went through it by default so I had to go to the sound settings and change output every time I booted. Uninstalling the equalizer or disable it didn't change this. I tried to change the default output by editing /etc/asound.conf. Since it didn't exist I created it, but it had no effect. I tried to clean up after myself by removing the file but then things got out of hand. The sound disappeared and the sound settings now looks like this\n\nBy running sudo alsa force-reload, I can get the sound back, but the sound settings remains broken. I have looked at questions similar to mine, but they provide no solution to my problem(s).\nSome answers provided to these questions says that the questioner should run:\nrm -r ~/.config/pulse; pulseaudio -k\n\nWhen I run this I get:\nE: [pulseaudio] main.c: Failed to kill daemon: No such process\n\nWhat should I try next?\n\nA: It turns out that all I had to do was to remove PulseAudio Equalizer.\n", "Q: Where are all the nodes in openstack needed for? I am currently learning Openstack (which is harder than I thought it would be). I see that when using Ubuntu and autopilot the install needs at least 6 nodes (excluding the managing node, correct me I am wrong here).\nBut what are all these nodes for? I looked at the internet, but am not exactly sure. Mostly because some posts are old or very short? I could guess for the compute node the network node and the storage node, but what else?\n\nA: You only need 5 physical machines to use autopilot.

These download OK but when I click 'install' I'm asked to authenticate with a password. I enter my administrator password and click authenticate, this fails and loops back to request a password. Frustrated to say the least.\nRegards WilRog.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses the sudo mechanism, rather than an administrator account. This allows the main user (and others, if configured) to elevate their privileges to run a command.\nEnter your password at these prompts, not the admin password.\n\nA: That most likely means you mistyped the password. \nThe password it asks for IS an administrator (aka \"sudo\") password but the password it asks is the one you provided during installation of the system and what is set for your main account. Type it out in gEdit so you can see you type it correctly (like capitals/small characters) and try with a copy/paste.\nA last option would be to reset it: you can do it with a live session (see How do I reset a lost administrative password? ).\n\nA: I solved my own problem. It was so simple and may help others with similar.\nI downloaded the Ubuntu 15.04 ISO Image (1.2GB), I had v 14 installed. I burned the image to a 4.7GB DVD Disc, CDs are only 650MBs, everything including Disc verification went faultlessly. \nWith the Disc inserted I rebooted the PC.

Can anyone recommend any software that adds a watermark to photos in bulk?\nI've been searching for a while now and I haven't found any quality ones.\nThank you\n\nA: Take a look at Phatch. It seems like it's pretty much abandonware these days, the latest release was in 2010, but I've been using it for probably that long and it makes batch editing very easy. It's in the Ubuntu repositories, so you can install it pretty easily from the Software Centre or from Synaptic (or with sudo apt-get install phatch). Unfortunately, the website seems to be down at the moment, so the documentation is also down - but I'm sure you can figure it out by pressing buttons.   ;-) \nTo add your own watermark to the Phatch option, save it as a PNG into ~/.local/share/phatch/watermarks. If you already have Phatch open when you copy the watermark image across, you will need to close it and open it again. \nThen add the \"Watermark\" action in Phatch, and select your image file. Then add a \"Save\" action, and run the action list against your files. \n\nA: You can write your own very quickly with image magick and bash/python\nLook at this this . (if you want more realistic watermarking image magick can still help you)\nUse the commands in the above tutorial after running\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\nThen put all the images you want watermarked in 1 directory and open a terminal in that directory.\nThen run\n<im command> ./*\n\n", "Q: Catch user input with alias So I recently showed my friend the wall command.  Now he keeps using it to talk and I regret showing him.  I want to make an alias call wall to keep him from using it and to also prank him.  I did alias wall=\"ls\" for now.  It works if the user just types wall, but if I type wall Hello world it functions like a regular wall command.  Is there a way where I can get the alias to capture user input and ignore that? so when he types wall hello world it will still function as ls?\n\nA: OK, so do these things:\nsudo echo \"PATH=~/.bin:$PATH\" >> /home/[username]/.bashrc\nsudo mkdir /home/[username]/.bin/\nsudo echo \"fortune | cowsay   # Or whatever command you want to run\" > /home/[username]/.bin/wall\nsudo chmod 755 /home/[username]/.bin/wall\n\nThat way, whenever [username] runs the command wall he'll get the output of fortune | cowsay.  Not an alias, but good enough.\n\nA: Functions can take precedence over aliases and commands. You can define function in his .bashrc that will take arguments but just ignore them.\nLike so\n  wall(){ echo \" just another brick in the wall \"  }\n\n", "Q: Can't boot Snappy from SD card on Beaglebone Black!

To troubleshoot this I've been trying to find a tool that monitors cpu usage (memory isnt a problem) that logs all of it.

It presents all the information in graphs through a web\n  interface. Its emphasis is on plug and play capabilities. After\n  completing a installation a high number of monitoring plugins will be\n  playing with no more effort.\n\nMunin comes with a good set of core plugins, which you can use to monitor values on your computers.\nFor example cpu usage, or memory usage, or disk usage etc...\nIf you need something special you could write yourself additional plugins.\nSetup\nUsually you set up 1 munin-server which is hosting the webinterface and an unlimited amount of munin-nodes.\nThe notes collect data and report it to the server instance which shows the graphs. \nServer and node can be on the same machine, so you can run both on the related server if needed - or you could move the server instance to some other machine and just install munin-node on the affected machine.\nDemo\nYou can browse a demo installation of munin 1.4 here which gives access to the graphs of several munin-nodes.\nThe current development version demo can be found here.\nThe CPU usage graph is categorized under system.\nAlternatives\nJust to name some of the other big software names in the monitoring area\n\n\n*\n\n*Nagios\n\n*Icinga\nBoth tend to be often used if you plan to monitor bigger environments - i.e. networks in companies or similar.\nThe munin project page itself lists alternatives as well.\n", "Q: A Simple way to force an \"Out of Memory\" condition?

I was trying to recover a drive, and was always told to make a LiveCD and run that. When I ran the LiveCD from boot, I started by running lsblk. Here is the result.\n\nI could be mistaken, but I think that the Ubuntu LiveCD has gone and created a SWAP partition right at the head of the disk I was trying to recover.\nsdb is the flash drive that I was using, as far as I can tell. It has the right size, approximately 32ish GB, and the drive i was trying to recover from was a 1TB drive, which is sda. lsblk was the first command I ran when I started the Live Environment. Any thoughts? Should I write this drive off as unrecoverable? Or am I misunderstanding what I'm reading?\n\nA: The Live images do not alter the partition tables of disks unless you are manually editing them (via command line or gparted), or are installing Ubuntu to the disk.\nYou assume that the Live images made alterations and that there's no partitions on the disk that are readable based on lsblk.  You need to try running sudo fdisk -l to list the actual data about partitions and their file types (unless it's a GPT partition table but it probably isn't).  More than likely, the disk you are working with has a swap partition already in place on the disk.  The Live images do auto mount swap partitions in an attempt to get swap, when a swap partition already exists.\nDon't forget to try and mount sda2 and sda3 before assuming the drive is damaged and irrecoverable.  It's very unlikely that a swap partition at the beginning of the disk would indicate drive death, especially if the other two partitions mount fine and the data there is accessible.\nAnd in follow up to your comment on whether Windows does this, Windows doesn't use swap partitions.\n", "Q: How to fix desktop error \"Permission denied\" I can't delete,add and put on desktop files and folder and with everything i only see this.

I'm trying to precisely understand when the ctime timestamp of a file is changed. In many places (e.g., in the accepted answer here) it is suggested that any change in the file attributes will also change ctime. However, this seems not to be true, at least on my Ubuntu 12.04 (yes, I know, a bit old...):\ncat file.txt > /dev/null\n\nchanges the atime, so it changes the file attributes (in the file inode), but does not change the ctime.\nOther sources (e.g., here and here) suggest that only some operations on the file attributes actually change the ctime, but a precise list is not provided.\nWhere may I find a precise reference to which operations change the ctime?\n\nA: There are three time stamps on Unix systems:\n\n\n*\n\n*atime: Access time\nThis time stamp tells you when the file was accessed the last time, including only reading access.\n\n*ctime: Change time\nThis time stamp tells you when the file attributes (inode information) changed the last time. That includes e.g ownership and permissions, but a content change also triggers an update of this time stamp.\nNote that changes to the atime seem to be an exception as they do not trigger a ctime update. This is probably because a simple read access which is enough to trigger an atime update does not make any relevant changes to the file attributes. And one of the main purposes of ctime is to help backup tools to determine if a file has changed. The atime is an irrelevant information for such tools and updating a backup just to update a changed atime because somebody has read the file would be useless.\nI'm not sure, but some people think this behavior (changes to atime do not update ctime) is only due to the mount options (like relatime) of the underlying file system that caches and delays atime updates in the inode for performance reasons in memory and only applies them to the real inodes on the disk (triggering a ctime update) under certain conditions.\n@kos tried it and apparently even when mounting a FS with the `strictatime``option, the ctime seems to never update if the atime changes.\n\n*mtime: Modification time\nThis time stamp tells you when the file's content was modified the last time. \n\nSo a simple read access using cat FILENAME only changes the atime, but not the ctime as no file attribute got modified. The changed atime does not count.\n", "Q: I have a file named \"-t\". How to remove it?

Once you disabled the online results, you won't get those very ugly result thumbnails from Wikipedia any more. \n\nI wrote a bug report/feature request about this issue against the unity-scope-home on Launchpad to ask for a child protection filter that either entirely blocks NSFW content from the search results in the Dash, only blocks them if they are no exact matches of the query, or only blocks at least their preview thumbnail to make them less offensive.\nIf you agree with me that this would be useful and you have a Launchpad account (or don't mind creating one - it's free of course and you only need to enter an email address), please consider confirming this bug.\nYou do this by visiting the link below, logging in to Launchpad, and then clicking on the yellow pencil icon next to the line\n\nThis bug affects N persons.

A bit of background.  I want to set up a 64-bit AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (HVM) on a solid-state disk with EBS in the eu-west-1 region.\nAt time of writing, within the AWS control panel quick start I'm offered Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-f95ef58a.\nA search for ami-f95ef58a in the AWS Community AMIs shows this image to be ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-trusty-14.04-amd64-server-20160114.5 - ami-f95ef58a.  So it appears this is a AMI released on 14 Jan 2016.\nHowever, if I search http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/ website and use the select boxes to narrow down my choice for my requirements I'm shown:\neu-west-1   trusty  14.04 LTS   amd64   hvm:ebs-ssd 20160314    ami-58cc762b    hvm\n\nI'm assuming the later release (ami-58cc762b) would be a better choice than the one offered in the quick setup.\nWhich leads me to the point of why are there so many releases of 14.04 LTS?  Surely, the LTS doesn't change so wouldn't it just be better to have a fixed static AMI and update it when it boots.\nAre the AMI instances constantly being produced to include patches and updates so the admin won't have to modify the base install?\nIf so, why doesn't AWS offer the most recent AMI in the quickset and instead offers a AMI that's two months out of date?\n\nA: AMIs are static images and cannot be changed. Even if they could be updated, they shouldn't be (at least not the public AMIs).\nThe reason for this is that automated deployments rely on precisely-known infrastructure and environments. Suppose I have a piece of code that is dependent on some library that is pre-installed on the AMI, and I know that that code works with the current AMI. If I create a CloudForamtion template to launch an instance with that AMI id and run that piece of code then it should always work. Forever.\nHowever, if the AMI was allowed to be \"updated\" and that update causes the library to be changed, then my code may or may not be compatible with the latest version of the library, potentially causing the code to fail. It doesn't matter if the library update was done with good intentions (i.e. a bug fix); it needs to be the decision of the application writer to update the AMI, and not the AMI maintainer.\nIf you are using something like CloudFormation to manage your environment, then the AMI ids will be stored in your templates (ideally version controlled!) and updated if and when you are ready to test a new version. Compatibility with a new AMI should be tested just as thoroughly as you would any new feature.\n", "Q: No module named 'numpy' Actually I am shifting from Windows to Linux.

So far everything seems to work except for the Wi-Fi. The wired connections seem to work, however, as the MacBook doesn't have an ethernet port (lol I know), I can only get a network connection through my phone right now.\nI have tried updating my drivers and looked at multiple \"supposed\" fixes on the web and nothing works.

Tested on two mice, same behavior. It was maybe registering 1 out of every 15 or so. I reinstalled all the packages that had \"mouse\" or \"input\" in the name, and the behavior seemed to improve. The side panel and desktop were both \"clickable\" and I could click most things in Chrome except the location bar and the tabs. After a short window of functionality, it has started to become more intermittent. Much of the time clicks work, but every once in a while they stop for 5-10 seconds. At this point I usually start clicking somewhere else, and when I go back clicks work again.\nRunning xinput query-state verifies that even when holding the left mouse button down, xinput sometimes registers it as up.\nSearching finds a few cases of this happening, and even one with 14.04, but no solutions. Is there something else I can try reinstalling?\nUpdate: Clicking on the desktop is never registered. After clicking on the desktop and going back to Chrome, clicks are not registered until I move the window. Once I move the window, all clicks are registered. I have replicated this at least 10 times, including after a restart.\n\nA: I took the nuclear option and ran this script\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor pkg in `dpkg --get-selections | awk '{print $1}' | egrep -v '(dpkg|apt|mysql|mythtv)'` ; do apt-get -y --force-yes install --reinstall $pkg ; done\n\nIt goes through everything installed and reinstalls it.

I currently have a C: drive with Windows, that I'd like to leave untouched and a D: drive with ~130GB of free space and some music/movies. \nIf I shrink the D: drive in Windows and leave, lets say, 60GB unallocated, will choosing the 'Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7' grab this unallocated space and install everything that is needed there? \nDo I have to create those swap and root partitions I keep reading about manually? If so, when and how?\nThank you.\n\nA: No it will not use unallocated space.\nIt will use the space that is already partitioned and used by Windows.  It'll also provide a very easy to use interface to determine how much space will be left for Windows and now much space will be used for Linux.  The interface is a GUI with a slider to choose how the space would be divided.\nThe procedure will then create an extended partition of the space you choose to give to Linux and create a two partitions, one for the Ubuntu installation and one for the swap space.\nIf you want to use the unpartitioned space you would have to use the Something Else option and do it manually.  While not as seamless, the manual option is also very easy with a GUI environment for the work.\n", "Q: How to create a keyboard shortcut for a terminal command I often work with git and loved iTerm2 for the ability to set keyboard shortcuts for commands. For example, I set CTRL+ENTER to git status.\nIs this possible with gnome-terminal or can you recommend another option to achieve this?\n\nA: 1. Automatically open a new terminal window, showing the output of your command\nSince you need to keep the terminal open after the command ran, putting:\ngnome-terminal -e 'bash -c \"git status; read line\"'\n\nunder a shortcut key combination, will do the job. It will open a new gnome-terminal window and run the command inside it.\nAdd it to a shortcut\nChoose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\ngnome-terminal -e 'bash -c \"git status; read line\"'\n\nto Ctrl+Enter\nNote\nAlthough your suggested shortcut works, you might pick another key combination then Ctrl+Enter, since it at least clashes with the LibreOffice shortcut to jump to a new page.\nExplanation\nTo have a new gnome-terminal window opened from command line, and run a command in it, you can use:\ngnome-terminal -e 'bash -c <command>'\n\nHowever, although the command will run successfully, the terminal window will close immediately before you can read the output.\nThe section:\nread line\n\nis then to keep the terminal open (until you hit Enter) after the command runs.\nOther commands\nThis way, you can run any (complex) command in the terminal, without having it closed immediately:\n$ gnome-terminal -e 'bash -c \"wmctrl -d; read line\"'\n\nwill output (if wmctrl is installed):\n\nAfter pressing Enter the terminal will close.\n2. Running a command in the currently active gnome-terminal window\nOf course you could place a simple one-liner under a shortcut key (assuming you have xdotool installed):\nxdotool type \"<command>\"\n\nThis would however type the command blindly, in any application, and typing the command is not the cleanest option.\nThe small script below therefore:\n\n\n*\n\n*looks if the active window is a gnome-terminal window (by its pid)\n\n*if so, it pastes the command in the active gnome-terminal window, presses Return. \nIf not, the script does nothing, So it won't paste into other applications.\n\n\nSince the script takes the targeted command as an argument, you can put multiple commands under multiple shortcuts.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nimport time\n\napp = \"gnome-terminal\"\ns = (\" \").join(sys.argv[1:])\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n\ndef front(app):\n    try:\n        # see if gnome-terminal is running at all (raising error if not)\n        app = get([\"pgrep\", app]) \n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        app = False\n    if app:\n        # if so, see if the active window belongs to gnome-terminal comparing pids)\n        active = get([\"xdotool\", \"getwindowpid\", get([\"xdotool\", \"getactivewindow\"])])\n        return True if app == active else False\n\nif front(app):\n    # copy command to clipboard\n    cm1 = [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", 'printf \"'+s+'\" | xclip -selection clipboard']\n    # paste in terminal window\n    cm2 = [\"xdotool\", \"key\", \"Control_L+Shift_L+v\"]\n    # press return\n    cm3 = [\"xdotool\", \"key\", \"Return\"]\n    for cm in [cm1, cm2, cm3]:\n        subprocess.call(cm)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs xdotool\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n*Create a dirctory ~/bin if it doesn't exist yet, either log out out/in or run source ~/.profile\n\n*Copy the script above into an empty file, save it as gterm_keys (no extension) in ~/bin, an make it executable\nNow You can run any command, from a shortcut key, in the frontmost gnome-terminal window by adding the command:\ngterm_keys <command>\n\nto a shortcut key, as described in [1]\n\nA: In case zsh is used instead of bash, the following line in ~/.zshrc binds git status to ALT+ENTER.\nbindkey -s '^[^M' 'git status\\n'\n\nTo get ALT+ENTER in Bash, I use this line:\nbind -x '\"\\e\\C-m\":git status'\n\n\nA: You can use bind -x to bind a command to a shortcut in Bash. For example, to bind git status command to Crtl+p shortcut you can use:\n bind -x '\"\\C-p\":git status'\n\nPut it into ~/.bashrc file to remember it. From man page:\n\n-x keyseq:shell-command\nCause shell-command to be executed whenever keyseq is entered. When shell-command is executed, the shell sets the\n  READLINE_LINE variable to the contents of the Readline line buffer and\n  the READLINE_POINT variable to the current location of the insertion\n  point. If the executed command changes the value of READLINE_LINE or\n  READLINE_POINT, those new values will be reflected in the editing\n  state.\n\n", "Q: Help required to install Oracle JDK 8 on Ubuntu 15.10 - Where and how? edit - the above link answered my question - it's up and running!.  thanks Pilot6 and shadow.\nI am a Linux newbie.

How to add an existent security group to a folder with the read/write permissions?\n\nA: A file or directory can only have one group associated with it.\nYou change that group from the terminal using this command:\nchgrp GROUPNAME FILENAME\n\nOf course you have to replace GROUPNAME with the desired group and FILENAME with the file or directory you want to modify. Depending on your current permissions for this file, you might have to run the command as root (using sudo).\n", "Q: Video card driver beginner nightmare First of all I'm a beginner on ubuntu so please forgive me if I lack any basic knowledge.\nHere's my issue : yesterday I installed ubuntu and somehow I managed to kind of ruin my video card drivers. \nI was doing fine until today when I reboot the resolution of my screen is detected wrongly. I go to the driver list and all option are greyed out, leaving me with \" continue using manually installed drivers \". I google the issue and end up with a bunch of commands that eventually allowed me to choose again between the drivers.\nProblem is it didn't fix anything. So I still have a wrong resolution ( that is the only option in the \"displays\" setting ) and it seems the video card ain't really used because of the very laggy desktop navigation.\nWhat I'm asking is some sort of commands that I could run to basically reset the graphical driver to a default.\nI realise I'm this position because I pasted some random commands without really understanding what I was doing, so please bear with me and try and explain to me what the command does.\nAlso I assume you'll need more informations so please ask but explain to me how to get those informations.\nThanks a lot !\n\nA: FYI, you can install ati proprietary graphics drivers through apt-get. First, perform all system updates and upgrades before you begin:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nreboot\nThen, run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install fglrx xvba-va-driver libva-glx1 libva-egl1 vainfo \n\nAlternatively, and to set back to default, you should be able to open \n\"additional drivers\" in your system settings. Wait a few moments for the drivers to be detected. Then, it should list the available, in use, and recommended proprietary and opensource drivers available.\nThe default drivers are the opensource drivers.\nsource\n", "Q: Microphone not working in Asus F555U The microphone is not working in Asus F555U in Ubuntu 14.04 and kernel 4.2.0-27-generic.

I faced \"upside down\" webcam WebRTC video on hangouts and facebook using Chrome web browser only. Firefox works fine. Cheese also displays video properly. \nAfter some googling I found this bug report. In the comment 22 you can see that 2 years ago there was a 0001-Use-libv4l2-for-Linux-V4L-grabber.patch proposed that fixes Chrome/Chromium behavior. For more then a year now libv4l2 is added to Chromium, but is not enabled for Linux. You can see the whole discussion in the bug report thread. Long story short it looks like they are not actively working on fixing this for almost a year now. However, there is some ugly workaround...\nYou can add Flip this extension to Chrome. It allows you to flip your webcam video or any other element of a webpage. It will flip it only locally, so people who you talk to via Chrome also need to use the same trick. It's not pretty, but it's working... well, kind of ; ) After all switching to Firefox maybe a better and more comfortable solution.

Ubuntu configures the CPU governor in a configuration file AFAIK. I want to locate and change the file correctly.\nI don't want to disable the default governor instead, learn how to correctly set one.\n\nA: The file is /etc/init.d/ondemand.\nWithout any additional packages, you can manipulate the frequency scaling governors using primitive commands.\nFirst, determine what available governors you have available:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors\n\nPerhaps see what you currently have:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n\nAnd then, if different than what you want, just set one of the other available governors, in this example performance:\n$ sudo su\n# for file in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do echo \"performance\" > $file; done\n# exit\n\nExample:\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors\nperformance powersave\nperformance powersave\nperformance powersave\nperformance powersave\nperformance powersave\nperformance powersave\nperformance powersave\nperformance powersave\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\n$ sudo su\n# for file in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do echo \"performance\" > $file; done\n# exit\nexit\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\n\n", "Q: Installing custom Screenlets This may be obscure, but how do I add custom screenlets to Screenlets?

Is there a way to edit these files in a text editor other than vim or nano through SSH, because there is a whole team of us that has to work on this project (front-end, DB management etc.), and we prefer working on it while it's on the server. I'm talking about editing files over SSH on text editors along the line of Sublime Text or Atom.\n\nA: If you already have ability to ssh onto that remote host then on local ubuntu machine issue\nsudo apt-get install sshfs\n\nmkdir ~/local_mountpointdir  # create empty local live mirror of remote dir\n\nsshfs remoteuserid@remotehost:/path/remote_dir  ~/local_mountpointdir\n\nYou are free to use any local editor to do live edits on any file living on that remote dir  /path/remote_dir  by editing the same filename found on your new local live mirror directory ... still on local machine issue\ncd  ~/local_mountpointdir\nls -la   # you will see all files listed which live on remote host\n\nNow just edit any file in  ~/local_mountpointdir which will live real time auto sync all edits up to remote host dir ... when done just kill the local box  pid running sshfs at which point the connection will be gone and so will the contents of  ~/local_mountpointdir  knowing they are safe up on remote host  ...  killall sshfs \n\nA: ssh into the server and run the following commands to install atom:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gdebi xauth\nwget https://atom.io/download/deb\nmv deb atom.deb\nsudo gdebi atom.deb\nrm atom.deb\n\nAfter installation, exit out of the ssh session.\nThen, you can forward an xsession over ssh using the -X option like so:\nssh -X username@serverip atom\n\nreplacing username and serverip with the actual username and actual server ip of course.\nHere are some related posts:\nhow-to-view-graphical-view-of-application-using-ssh\nhow-to-forward-x-over-ssh-from-ubuntu-machine\nAlso, here is a related article. \n\nA: You could use emacs as well. It has a wide range of features and a NoX mode\nemacs -nw <filename>\n\nThough the question is still, what functions are you looking for?\n\nA: gEdit can do what you want. You can set your system up to connect to a remote server through Nautilus (files, connect to server). You can then use the left pane (F9) in gEdit to browse to this remote server and start editing away. \nI use Aptana for things like that. It has a \"remote ftp\" method where you create a connection, point to a directory and it lists all the files so you can edit them. For html, js and other coding languages an IDE like Aptana has code formatting. Oh and don't discard vim so easily ;) Eclipse, Bluefish, Anjuta, Geany are some other EDI's but I did not check the all for remote access ;)\nYou might need to change permissions on the files you want to be able to edit on the server side though. \n\nA: If you start your ssh session with the -X option you can use any installed editor, man -k editor | less to see what your system has. The -X option will set up X11 forwarding back to you. See man ssh.\nWhat features of \"Sublime Text or Atom\" are you looking for?\n\nA: I agree with what a few people have mentioned about forwarding GUI apps over SSH. I tend to do that with a few things we run e.g. On our IBM TSM server. I've never used the editors you've mentioned but I think forwarding it over X is the way to go if your wanting to use SSH. \n\nA: I know what you mean. Vim is a very powerful tool, but nearly no-one \"knows\" how to use it.\nI actually prefer mcedit (the editor packaged with mc - Midnight Commander) which I tend to install for SSH connections anyway.\nIf you want to use a graphical editor you could install a X server to share GUI over SSH as some other answers suggest. But IMO that's overkill and a lot of extra stuff on your server. I would rather suggest you share the folders containing the pages to be worked on, preferably over NFS as it would be the least extra installs, or even just WebDAV seeing as your server is already running a web serving daemon. Though if your client computers are running Windows you'd need samba instead, just ensure you NEVER allow Samba to share outside your local LAN - [sarcasm=on]it's not the most secure thing to do[/sarcasm].\nIf you need full access to all folders on the server I would suggest SFTP over your SSH connection. It's also already on your server as you've got SSH up and running already - no extra installs needed on your server which is a BIG plus. It's even possible to mount a SFTP as a network \"drive\", at least natively in all Linuxes (as one answer suggests through sshfs). For Windows it requires something like Swish installed (or perhaps Dokan SSHFS).\nThough for content on a web server I would definitely suggest you look at some form of CMS (especially if more than one person is to edit stuff). Best would actually be a versioning system, probably Git or SVN. They should be rather simple to install on your web server.\n", "Q: Copy file with smbclient and path to directory I'm stuck in NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME error but can't understand what I'm doing wrong.\nMy objective: copy a file from ubuntu to windows in a simple command line to be called by php.\nThe problem: when I add more than one folder to the path it throws the NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME error.\nExample:\nsmbclient -U someuser%somepassword //10.0.1.250/Home/Public/Offline -c 'put \"test.deb\"'\n\nDomain=[FILESERVER] OS=[Windows Server 2012 Standard 9200] Server=[Windows Server 2012 Standard 6.2]\ntree connect failed: NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME\n\nBut when I try just:\nsmbclient -U someuser%somepassword //10.0.1.250/Home\n\nIt connects and I can do a put with the same file:\nsmb: \\> cd Public/Offline\nsmb: \\Public\\Offline\\> put test.deb\n\nSo it not seems to be a permissions issue.\nWhat could I doing wrong?\n\nA: Try to use the initial directory option (--directory Public/Offline)\n", "Q: Fonts not showing with ubuntu studio 14.04.4 and LCD TV, can you help me?

If its sole purpose is to perform this check, the file can be empty, but usually dotfiles also serve as configuration files. For example, the Zsh shell prints this if the configuration file ~/.zshrc does not exist when it starts:\nThis is the Z Shell configuration function for new users,\nzsh-newuser-install.\nYou are seeing this message because you have no zsh startup files\n(the files .zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc, .zlogin in the directory\n~).

I've created an Ubuntu Server ISO with a set of custom packages I want installed during the installation process. I alos have a preseed and kickstart file working. This took me a while but I have it working thanks to: How to create a Customized Ubuntu Server ISO?\nNow I need to do things such as: \n\n\n*\n\n*setting some firewall rules \n\n*writing some conf files\n\n*placing down keys\n\n*changing system name\n\n*ultimately creating a custom shell\n\n\nThis is a lot for me to digest and it is taking me a long time to understand which tool or part of the process I should be doing the above with. I think anything that has to do with just placing files can be done with a custom deb package and installed like my other packages. However, I don't know the best place for setting the host name, setting firewall rules, and eventually creating a custom shell/interface to limit the non root user's abilities. Note: Everything at this stage should be possible with the disc only... no internet access.\nI've read this page and I believe I can script almost anything I'd need but only before the full system has booted: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization. The purpose here is to get the server setup and secure to receive its final customization from Chef.\nBasically, I just need to know where to begin with the bullets and could use pointers to examples. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: I followed shvahabi's advice here How can I make \"rc.local\" run on startup?. Basically, I'm enabling and using rc.local on the ubuntu box. Rc.local is normally not used on debian. It's very similar to Window's registry run keys. Ultimately I'll have my first boot configuration script AND the custom rc.local file in a custom deb package that places the files on the box at installation time (custom deb lives on the ISO itself). Then, on every boot, the rc.local will run my script and I can put a check in so that it only runs on the first boot.\nImportant note: edit and use \"/etc/rc.local\" to place a line to run your script... NOT \"/etc/init.d/rc.local\". The second one is actually controlled by another package and will NOT let you install a custom version of it from a custom deb file during installation. The init.d version's sole purpose is to call the \"/etc/rc.local\" one anyways.\nI'm not using systemd or upstart because you need to type in commands to start the services first. This needed to be hands free. HOWEVER, I believe all those commands do is make link files, but I didn't feel like figuring out where to place those. Two files in a custom deb package is easiest.\n", "Q: hostapd hotspot will only appear when ethernet is plugged in This has been driving me nuts all day.\nIm using a fresh Ubuntu 15.10 on an odroid UX4 & Wifi Module 4 (RT5572N chipset)\nWhat I want is: automatically start hotspot on boot + ability to hotplug ethernet cable whenever I need some temporary internet access, without disrupting the hotspot.\nFollowed the guide here exactly:\nhttp://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:xu4_wlan_ap#configure_access_point\nhttp://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:xu4_wlan_ap#configuration_for_wifi_module_4\nIt all seemed fine until I noticed that the ap/network gets created only if I plug in the ethernet cable. So:\nSo cold boot and no ethernet -> no hotspot. As soon as I plug in the ethernet cable, the hotspot appears and everything seems to work perfectly. I can connect to the hotspot from a different machine, access the outside internet, etc. I can also unplug the ethernet and it all continues to work fine. As soon as I reboot though, it wont work anymore.  So for some odd reason plugging in the ethernet is the trigger.\nMy suspicion is network manager is the culprit somehow.\nI tried adding allow-hotplug eth0 to the interfaces file (as one forum post suggested) but no difference.\nEdit: Just to clarify. The host computer is an odroid ux4 which will be used in the field inside a la. It runs a webserver (amongst other things) and needs to be able to operate fully standalone (no internet). However, a some points (e.g., for updates, etc) I would just want to be able to plug in an ethernet cable (or USB modem for that matter) and then transparently be able to access the wider internet through the wifi connection.

I'd try and skip the \n\nSetting for forwarding Internet over WIFI from eth0 \n\npart of your tutorial.\n\nA: After log of googling and mucking around with config files I stumbled across the excellent create_ap script by oblique:\nhttps://github.com/oblique/create_ap\nThis avoided any muddling with config files and worked out of the box.\nAs for this specific question about having eth0 transparently shared into the wifi. See this github issue for a suggested solution (have not been able to try it yet though):\nhttps://github.com/oblique/create_ap/issues/149\n\nA: I found out that in this situation the wlan0 interface will only come available after the eth0 has reached the timeout value that is set inside the /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf. So setting the timeout to for example 10 will make the wlan0 available after 10 seconds of trying to get an ip for eth0.\n", "Q: How can I change the system font?

What I can see right off the bat is that the directory he created was \"rails\" inside the user's home directory, which is the first location you tried before moving it to /root/testapp/public\nThe default permissions keep home directories, including root's, private. This means that although you allow access in the Apache configuration file with the directive Require All Granted, all that does is tell Apache it's ok to serve up the files. But without the right permissions settings on the folders themselves, Apache won't be able to read the directory in order to serve it.\nApache needs both read and execute permissions on the directory, and execute permissions on all directories from there up to root.

So what have I done? \n 1. I have done sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade at least 10 - 15 times \n 2. I have gone in to the directory /var/log/dist-upgrade and checked in the apt.log in there after broken packages... let's just say that the list contains 50+ packages, where as I noticed some strange thing about them. Most of them are listed as \"broken\" in there because a 64-bit version depends on a 32-bit version of the same program. which I went through at least 25 of those cases (just looking, not doing anything), and after that I saw the pattern. Most cases, if not all cases (doubt it) were like that. \n 3. I have unmarked all the PPA's I've added by myself, and then removed all of the nvidia drivers (a fan on my graphics card broke and started to vibrate my MBoard to bits), I thought that maybe those would help, but sadly it did not. \nWhile deleting programs I thought I should do some sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get purge to see if what would be taken away, and that was about 50+ packages (I think).\nnow, I got a decent amount of paste to stick here, so I went over to pastebin and glued it stuck there instead \nStill nothing works, so here I am asking this community for help, and hopefully we can get this riddle solved :)\nCheers\n/ F4rm0r\nEdit:\nAs it turns out 16.04 is just around the corner, and as I had forgotten completely to look it up (due to being tired) I have now decided that I will wait approximately 4 weeks for it to be properly released.\nThank you for all of your suggestions so far, appreciated!  :)\n\nA: As mentioned in the comment section, you need to run the following command and then post the errors if any:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nIt should be noted that this is a real gutsy way to upgrade to a new version. I can't say that I don't do it myself as it does come with advantages but broken package management if at least temporary should be expected. If the above command doesn't work, post the errors and we will go from there. \nIt should also be noted that this may not be so easy as there is a transition to systemd that apt-get may not fully be able to handle.\nNormally, you should run the following command to do the upgrade:\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nIn a few weeks, 16.04 will be released and then you would run the following instead:\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nYou may have to wait until then as this is the next LTS release and so an upgrade from 14.04 should be expected.\nAs always, possibly consider some sleep as things may seem more easy in the morning.\n", "Q: Problem in mounting hard disks I previously had Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04(32 bit) on my system.I installed Ubuntu 14.04(64 bit) replacing the 32 bit Ubuntu,But it also Removed Windows 10.Now,the problem is,My hard disk partitions are not mounting posing an error:\nError mounting /dev/sda5 at /media/pavan/DSK1_VOL2: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda5\" \"/media/pavan/DSK1_VOL2\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda5': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.

If that is the case, you aren't going to find a lot of people on this site who will go out of their way to help you, but I will see what I can offer.\nIn keeping with the spirit of this site, which is to educate and assist, I will only say that what you wish to do, first requires that you erase the hard drive entirely, and that you then seek help ELSEWHERE for how to install Windows onto that hard drive from scratch.\nMy advice is to begin by booting to whatever Live-Boot CD or USB stick which you initially used to install Ubuntu onto your hard drive, and then open the disk utility to erase your hard drive.  It is really easy to figure out how to do that.  I could get a lot more detailed, but as you have not revealed which version of Ubuntu you have installed, it would be difficult to ensure that the precise instructions I gave you would be entirely accurate.\n", "Q: Executing tftp command without entering tftp command line I want to execute the tftp command without entering into the \"tftp command line\".\nI have tried the below commands: \ntftp xx.xx.xx.xx -c put file1 file2\ntftp xx.xx.xx.xx -m binary -c file1 file2\n\nBut I got:\nusage:tftp host-name [port]\ntftp>\n\nAfter the \"usage:\" message its entering the tftp command line.\nI have tried it with the verbose option turned on. \nI just want to know if the command I given worked properly.

Use like so:\n#   sleep 10; alert\nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\"'\n\nUse of default alias “alert” explains what it does.\nAnd here is an example of the default notification on my system (using xfce4-notify) when I run ls; alert which, of course, completes successfully:\n\nIf I run a nonsensical command, asdfgh; alert, I see this:\n \nThe terminal icon has been replaced with the error icon because of  \n-i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\"\n\nAs of now, the notification has just two items:\n  - the icon which is terminal or error depending on the success of the \"previous\" command\n  - the command itself (ls in the first case and asdfgh in the second)\nI can modify the existing alias to include a line of text above the command like this:  \nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"Task finished\" \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\"'\n\nThen, if I run ls; alert and asdfgh; alert I get the notifications shown below.\n\n\nMy question is this: Both notifications show \"Task finished\" but can the same logic that is used to decide whether the terminal icon or the error icon is shown be applied again to determine which text string is shown above the command? So, if the terminal icon displays, the text would be \"Task finished\" but if the error icon displays, the text could something like \"Something went wrong!\"\n\nA: Tl;dr\nUse this:\nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && (echo terminal; exit 0) || (echo error; exit 1))\" \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo Task finished || echo Something went wrong!)\" \"$(history | sed -n \"\\$s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*\\(.*\\)[;&|]\\s*alert\\$/\\1/p\")\"'\n\n\nSimply evaluating $? again won't work, because by the time $? would be evaluated the second time it would contain the first command subsitution's ($([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)'s) exit status (always 0 since the two echos would always succed). A trick to go around this would be making the first command substitution exit with an equivalent exit status again:\n$([ $? = 0 ] && (echo terminal; exit 0) || (echo error; exit 1))\n\nThis way $? could be evaluated a second time in order to decide which string to print:\nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && (echo terminal; exit 0) || (echo error; exit 1))\" \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo Task finished || echo Something went wrong!)\" \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\"'\n\nOn another note your history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'' is a bit over-convoluted. This would be way more readable:\nhistory | sed -n \"\\$s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*\\(.*\\)[;&|]\\s*alert\\$/\\1/p\"\n\nSo, final command:\nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && (echo terminal; exit 0) || (echo error; exit 1))\" \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo Task finished || echo Something went wrong!)\" \"$(history | sed -n \"\\$s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*\\(.*\\)[;&|]\\s*alert\\$/\\1/p\")\"'\n\nYou can test by running (exit 0); alert and (exit 1); alert.\n", "Q: When copying files via USB from Ubuntu to Windows 7, there is a different number of files What's up guys, I'm trying to backup some Ubuntu files to my Windows machine.

What's the difference here? I'm assuming one is counting folders and files differently, but the numbers still don't add up. Is there anyway to account for this difference?\n\nA: The trick is . . . hidden dot files( the ones that have leading dot in the name, e.g. .file1.txt ). They are included in the total count of files and folder size , but are not shown by default. Observe the example bellow: I've a folder /home/xieerqi/EXAMPLE where I copied contents of my /etc/passwd file. In the properties you can see total count of two, but without .test1 being shown , you will only see test2.\n\nWhat you want to do is open file manager's  View menu and ensure Show Hidden Files is checked, or press Ctrl+H to have the same effect. Alternatively , if you are not shy of using command line, you can use rsync -a SOURCE_DIR DESTINATION_DIR\n rsync -a /home/user/Pictures /media/user/usb_drive\n\n", "Q: How to install php 7 to run beside php 5 on ubuntu with nginx I want to try php 7 and get my site working on php 7 in the same time keeping other sites working on php 5 just in case. so that from the domain virtual host config I can decide which php to run.\nI looked at php version management and saw it is possible to run two versions, though the ones I found seems for apache.  I'm looking for more clear instructions on how to do this under nginx. I have also hhvm running in case that matters.  \n\nA: Firstly, you need to install php5-fpm and php7.0-fpm from Ondřej Surý's PPA for co-installable php5 and php7.0.:\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nsudo LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php\n\nWe then, with nginx, suggest using the FPM packages.  So, install the packages accordingly:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n# We need to ***remove*** php5 packages, so we can use php5.6 packages\n# from the PPA instead\nsudo apt-get remove php5-common\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n# Now we install php5.6 packages.\nsudo apt-get install php5.6-fpm\n\n# Now, install php7.0-fpm.  You may need to install separate PHP plugins\n# for databases, extensions, etc. later.\nsudo apt-get install php7.0-fpm\n\nSource: An answer on the \"How to install php 7?\" question, and custom comments and modifications from myself.\n\nSecondly, nginx.  nginx is only able to be as good as your configurations.  You very likely have a PHP handling block on your nginx server block(s) similar to this (from the 'default' example config):\n# pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000\n\nlocation ~ \\.php$ {\n    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;\n\n    # With php5-fpm:\n    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;\n}\n\nThis configuration will only pass to php5-fpm.  In effect, this will apply for your entire server block.  The easiest way to go about this is to have a second server block (for, say, test.domain.tld), and provide instead the PHP 7.0 fastcgi_pass destination.  In php7.0 on Xenial, this is going to end up something like this (extracted from a fix recently uploaded to the Xenial nginx package), however I do not know the layout of Ondrej's package so I cannot give exact specifics there (check /etc/php7.0/fpm/pool.d/www.conf or similar to determine where it's listening):\nlocation ~ \\.php$ {\n    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;\n\n    # With php7.0-fpm:\n    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php7.0-fpm.sock;\n}\n\nYou will have to do something similar for your php5 block, to validate that php5.6 sockets are used instead of the built-in php5 socket (which we just removed).\nThen, use the second test domain to run the php7.0 testing.  Make sure, though, to make a copy of your site if you want to do this - it will likely be necessary to have a separate testing copy so that once you've finished getting it working with php7.0, you can just 'switch over' without issue.\nThere is, unfortunately, no easy way to make php5 and php7.0 work within the same server block, not without altering your paths for your site, applications, etc. to have one for php5 and one for php7.0; such reworking of sites can get nasty, hence the suggestion to run two separate copies of the site code, one for php7.0 migration and one for php5 in production.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu with Windows 8 on a separate partition I used a lIVE CD to install ubuntu and I selected the option install with windows 8.

However, if the pack doesn't exist or is old, ureadahead runs in \"trace\" mode, monitoring what files are opened and recording them in the pack file to be used in future boots. \nIt is trace mode that puts out these messages. So, if you boot again within a year, no messages. This is why people are seeing the problem seemingly \"solve itself\", but they will come back in a year, and can be made to reappear by removing /var/lib/ureadahead/pack; \nThere's a package trigger to do this when things change in /etc/init.d, so the re-read is often done after an update.  ureadahead seems to have always worked this way, but the warnings are just written to stderr, and prior to systemd and journald, the messages never went anywhere.  Probably ureadahead should be changed to only put out these messages in --verbose mode, but in the meantime I worked around the file by running ureadahead in --quiet mode.  I was able to do this with a systemd drop-in file: create a file named /etc/systemd/system/ureadahead.service.d/quiet.conf containing\n[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStart=/sbin/ureadahead -q\n\n\nA: I would recommend canvassing the log before ureadahead starts writing to it. \nMy system had the same symptoms and what I found were errors relating to the lack of a Java Runtime Environment:\ngnome-session[939]: javaldx: Could not find a Java Runtime Environment!\n\nAs well as errors noting the absence of a certain library: libvdpau_nvidia.so.\ngnome-session[939]: Failed to open VDPAU backend libvdpau_nvidia.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nWhat I did was install JRE8 and then create symlinks to /usr/lib/libvdpau_nvidia.so where it was being searched for.

Here is the scenario in question:\n\n\n*\n\n*My home PC IP : 192.168.1.106\n\n*Home public IP: XXX.YYY.ZZZ.254\n\n*My office PC IP: 192.168.10.130\n\n*Office public IP: XXX.YYY.ZZZ.160\nHow do I can SSH from 192.168.1.106 (my home) to 192.168.10.130 (office) or vice versa? Is this possible? Please help me. \n\nA: You need a public facing port to connect to. \nA good solution is NGROK ,  search \"TCP tunnel\" \nyou want ngrok tcp 22.\nIt exposes the port to its own temporary domain name that is public facing. \nngrok is free, though the free users have their domain reset when ngrok closes. Putting the computer to sleep doesn't close down ngrok.  Just don't close down ngrok and you should be fine.\nThe other option I have done is to buy a host, (domain optional) (I use digitalocean, and namesilo), then use tinc to vpn my home computer, my server, and my laptop with my server as the host and the other two computers as clients. I then ssh to my server, then I can ssh to my other computer.  \n\nA: Use port forwarding on your router configuring for sample all entering traffic through ports 20 to 29 be redirected to the internal IP address with the same ports.\nAdditionally to this you may consider an external dynamic DNS service such as dyn.com (formerly dyndns.com) or noip.com.\n\nA: This is possible if you have port forwarding on a receiving router. For instance, if you want to ssh from office back to home, you need to go into home router settings first, and set up port forwarding for port 22 to a specific IP address on your home network and port number, in your case 192.168.1.106 port 22. That way if you do from office ssh user@XXX.YYY.ZZZ.254 , you will be redirected from router to your home computer.\nSettings for port forwarding differ form router to router; just to get a feel for it, look at the examples in the How To Forward Ports on Your Router article\nWith office, it may be difficult because it depends on your company and typically IT would say no, but you might want to ask them\n\nA: Yes, it is absolutely possible. You typically use port forwarding for that (for different residential routers, the way you do port forwarding may vary). There is one problem with it, however. Most Internet service providers will not allow you to do that. So, probably you will not be able to access your home computer from work. Remote login over the Internet is almost always means that you're going to have to contact your ISP to tell them that you want this feature enabled which most likely will cost you additional money. At least, that was the case with me when I wanted to get access to my computer at home from work.\nFor additional information on how to properly set up port forwarding, just look on YouTube.\n\nA: This happens due to the retail routers having a default setting of only allowing ICMP and blocking others (such as Telnet, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS), especially on GPON Gateways. The solution can be achieved in two steps which need to be performed on the router of your SSH Server:\n\n*\n\n*Type in 192.168.1.X in your browser (X being the serial of the router, generally X=1). This opens the login page. The default passkey and username is 'admin'. Go to the Security settings, go to the \"Access Control\" sub-menu and enable \"Allow\" for SSH under WAN (if you use Wifi to SSH into the target machine via the router) and under LAN (if you use Ethernet to SSH into the target machine via the router).\n\n\n*Next, more to Application Settings and choose the Post Forwarding menu. Now on the browser you will see a lot of fields. One of them must be \"Applications\", which is a drop down menu and choose SSH Server. Next in the \"Internet Client\" drop down menu choose the device/machine from list of devices connected to the router into which you want to SSH. Click on Add.\nYou can add multiple devices in this manner. In that case, you will have to explicitly specify the device from the SSH Client.\nFor example lets say, you have added three devices:\nDev A: 192.168.1.2\nDev B: 192.168.1.3\nDeb C: 192.168.1.4\nSo if you want to SSH into Dev B you must enter the following command:\nssh usernameofDevB@AAA.BBB.CCC.XXX\n\nwhere AAA.BBB.CCC.XXX is the public IP displayed by the router.\n\nA: All these answers worked for me, but I think that it needs to be stated more briefly for some who read...\nTo do this, you must use SSH port forwarding, which is the same as creating an SSH tunnel.\nYou must do one of three things:\n\n*\n\n*Forward port 22 to the target device from your router.\n\n*Forward port 22 from a jump server.\n\n*If you are familiar with Docker, WSL or other container technologies, use a Linux container as a jump server.\n\nA good reference is provided by the developers of SSH.\nSSH Academy | Tunneling\nYour router or jump server must be connected to both networks. You could also check out DDNS. There are many free DDNS services, such as Dynu.\n", "Q: Plank dock undesirable effect when using \"Pressure Reveal\" I am using Plank as my dock for sometime now and it works magnificently.

Also I'm using the PPA version (I believe there's one in the official Ubuntu repositories), version 0.11.0. Thanks!\n\nA: Strangely, this problem went away when I switched to GNOME Desktop, but GNOME itself is giving me some other weird bugs. My best guess about this would be that Compiz was the culprit.

If anybody knows how to get Plank's \"Pressure Reveal\" work in Compiz then I'll set you as the accepted answer.

I can't understand the difference between the filesystem specified using fdisk's command line interface with t. And the one used to format it later using say mkefs.\nWhy do we need to specify it twice?\n\n\n*\n\n*Say I launch an fdisk session using sudo fdisk /dev/sdb1  \n\n*Now, I create a partition using the n command.  \n\n*Then I change the file system type using the t command.\n\n*After that, I still have to format the partition and specify the file system again.\n\n\nA: When you want to change the partition type like linux to Fat, \nIn this case, you have use the t command to change the partition type,like below,\nDevice         Boot Start     End Sectors  Size Id Type\n**/dev/mmcblk0p1       8096   90111   82016   40M 83 Linux**\n/dev/mmcblk0p2      90112 7634943 7544832  3.6G 83 Linux\n\nCommand (m for help): t\nPartition number (1,2, default 2): 1\nHex code (type L to list all codes): c\n\nChanged type of partition 'Linux' to 'W95 FAT32 (LBA)'.\n\nCommand (m for help): p\nDisk /dev/mmcblk0: 3.7 GiB, 3909091328 bytes, 7634944 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0x1d437f06\n\nDevice         Boot Start     End Sectors  Size Id Type\n**/dev/mmcblk0p1       8096   90111   82016   40M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)**\n/dev/mmcblk0p2      90112 7634943 7544832  3.6G 83 Linux\n\nNote: I have changed the first partition to FAT32 from linux using t command to set the respective HEX code for that.\n\nA: What you specify with the t command of fdisk is the partition type.

However, when the trackpad is in a 'stopped working' state, the keyboard starts behaving very strangely. Sometimes a key will get 'stuck' for a second or so even though I've only touched it once.

I got my hands on one of those notebooks with 64-bit Intel processors and Windows 8 64-bit installed by default.\nFirst, I wanted to install 32-bit Ubuntu 14.04 on this machine.\nI eventually learned that I should turn off SecureBoot from BIOS, as well as FastBoot (Is disabing Secure Boot needed for Ubuntu 14.04 dual-boot with Windows 8 UEFI); then I tried to boot the USB thumbdrive with UEFI (which I cannot remember if it worked); eventually the live USB 14.04 32-bit booted. \nI first tried keeping the Windows restore partitions, and install only on the main partition, but after all of that failed, I wiped the disk and setup a new partition table - and I could get Ubuntu 32-bit to install. apparently successfully - but when trying to boot from the installation after that, I'd get: \nReboot and select proper Boot Device\nor Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device\n\nThis is also noted in \"Reboot and select proper boot device\" error after clean Ubuntu 13.04 install - and after finding Clean Install of Ubuntu won't boot [reboot and select proper boot device], I noted this:\n\nIf your computer has EFI or UEFI firmware or has pre-installed Windows 8, you must choose Ubuntu 64-bit version. 32-bit version will not work.\n\nAnd then I replaced the Ubuntu 32-bit installer on my USB thumbdrive with an Ubuntu 64-bit, and finally could both go through the installation successfully - and have this installed version boot from the main partition on the system.\nSo far, so good - but I think sometimes I may need a 32-bit system for debugging and such. So, since my knowledge of UEFI and the like is pretty poor, I would like to ask (before I waste hours on this, before finding it is impossible):\nProvided I already have a working 64-bit UEFI installation on the main drive of this computer, does it get easier if I decide to: shrink the 64-bit partition to make space; then make a new partition for the 32-bit system; and finally, install Ubuntu 32-bit from a USB thumbdrive on this partition?\nI have seen in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI, that: \n\nUse a 64bit disk of Ubuntu. (Ubuntu32bit cannot be easily installed in UEFI mode. This is a problem if 32-bit UEFI is the only way your computer can boot, e.g. if you have a modern Intel Atom based laptop. In this case, you will need a complicated work-around.) \n\n... however, I am not sure if these instructions apply only to first-time install of Ubuntu on a system (or possibly, for a side-by-side with Windows). \nI'm sort of hoping that in my case, where I want a 64-bit and a 32-bit Ubuntu side by side (and no Windows), would be easier: my reasoning is that having had 64-bit already successfully installed, the install process would have already set up boot partitions, \"bootable\" labels etc appropriately - and then, when the 32-bit version is installed, it would detect Grub on the machine, and it would simply add itself as an entry, instead of trying to install the bootloader from scratch (even though the installer always asks explicitly what device should the bootloader be installed on, which makes me fear that the 32-bit install process may overwrite the correct bootloader of the 64-bit one, and thereby mess up things).\nSo - has anyone tried this before, and can one expect an easier (that is, a straightforward) install process in this case; or should one expect breakage of the working 64-bit install, if a 32-bit install is attempted side-by-side thereafter?\n\nA: The Easy Way\nThe easy way to do what you want is to not boot the 32-bit Ubuntu directly; instead, install it in a virtual machine (in VirtualBox, QEMU, or VMware, for instance). Depending on your exact needs, this may be all you need, and it's a lot easier than trying to get everything properly multi-booting. OTOH, if you're developing, say, drivers for your computer's hardware, a virtual machine will probably not do what you want.\nThe Hard Way\nBroadly speaking, I can think of three ways to do what you want (aside from the easy solution of using a virtual machine):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go 100% BIOS/CSM/legacy -- You can wipe the computer and install all your OSes using the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables BIOS-mode boot loaders to work. This will make it much like installing on a computer from several years ago. The trick is that it can be hard to control the boot mode of installation media, particularly if you're unfamiliar with the tools and techniques used to do so. See my Web page on the subject for more information; however, that page is written with an eye towards discouraging mixed-mode installation, so information on doing a 100% BIOS-mode setup is kind of buried amidst other things. Also, if you want to keep Windows, you'll need to jump through some exotic hoops or re-install it completely, and to do the latter you'll need to track down appropriate installation media.\n\n*Use a 64-bit EFI-mode GRUB to launch a 32-bit kernel -- The 64-bit EFI-mode GRUB 2 can launch 32-bit Linux kernels -- or at least, some of them can. (GRUB binaries vary significantly in how they're built, so I can't promise that all 64-bit EFI-mode GRUB binaries will do the job.) As a practical matter, to work in this way, you'd probably want to install Windows, then a 32-bit Ubuntu (in BIOS mode will work fine), then the 64-bit Ubuntu in EFI mode. Ideally, the 64-bit Ubuntu's GRUB should detect the 32-bit Ubuntu installation and create separate menu entries for it. They might not be well-labeled, but they should work. If they aren't detected, it might be possible to create entries manually.\n\n*Use rEFInd to boot 64-bit EFI-mode OSes and your 32-bit BIOS-mode OS -- This approach is similar to the preceding one; however, you would install my rEFInd boot manager after completing the 64-bit Ubuntu installation. You would then edit /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is among the options. The result is that rEFInd will enable you to launch Windows or 64-bit Ubuntu in EFI mode, and it will show a gray diamond-shaped icon that will launch the BIOS-mode GRUB from the 32-bit Ubuntu installation. This GRUB will in turn launch the 32-bit Ubuntu. (It may eventually pick up and show options to launch the 64-bit Ubuntu in BIOS mode, too.)\n\n\nIn theory, any of these options should work. In practice, they all present pitfalls during setup, and any might be blocked by firmware quirks or other problems. Thus, you may need to try two or even all three of them before you get something to work.\n\nA: Ok, tried it, it works - but there are caveats, so here's my notes:\nThe bios on this PC gave me two options for booting Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit desktop bootable USB thumbdrive: UEFI, and non-UEFI one. The UEFI choice simply rebooted the BIOS, so I had to use the non-UEFI one. Once the USB thumbdrive booted, chose Try Ubuntu.\nFrom here, I ran gparted (or gparted-pkexec), then shrunk the main partition of the Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit, then made the unallocated space into a new ext4 partition. At this point, it is visible that the 64-bit installer made a separate partition for boot - note this for later.\nAt this point, I ran the Install Ubuntu icon from the live 32-bit run. When it comes to the Installation Type screen (see http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop), here choose \"Something Else\", and simply doubleclick at the partition made in the previous step, \"use\" it as ext4, and have it as mount point / (the root), then continue the setup.\nAbout here you will get the “Reserved BIOS boot area” prompt (\"..  If you do not go back to the partitioning menu and correct this error, ..\", see Should I create the Reserved BIOS boot area partition?) - you can ignore this and proceed, as we saw with our own eyes previously in gparted that there already is such a boot partition.\nWhen the 32-bit installation finishes and the PC reboots, you will notice there is no Grub menu at start, instead the PC boots directly into the 64-bit OS. In here, as per I can't get grub menu to show up during boot, I changed GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT etc (see https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Simple-configuration.html and Bug #1258597 “Warning: Setting GRUB_TIMEOUT to a non-zero value ...”) values in /etc/default/grub, and ran sudo update-grub - I think it is this that made the 32-bit install partition be found, and it's menu entry get added to Grub menu. When this run is finally rebooted, the Grub menu should be shown at startup - if not, try holding/tapping Shift as soon as the BIOS screen goes by.\nNow I can boot in the newly installed 32-bit, I run apt-get update + dist-upgrade as there's a new kernel, the new kernel gets installed, and now there should be an extra entry in the Grub menu, so update-grub gets ran in 32-bit mode automatically by apt-get dist-upgrade, and will unfortunately make a mess of the boot process. Next time we reboot, if we want to go to the 32-bit OS via the Grub menu, we will be greeted with Grub errors like \"file not found\" and \"unaligned pointer\".\nLuckily, at this point, the Grub entry for the 64-bit process is still uncorrupt, so we can boot in the 64-bit system, and here issue sudo update-grub to correct the Grub boot.\nNow, at this point there are two minor glitches. First, the names shown in the Grub menu are something like \"Ubuntu\" for the 64-bit (the first) install, and \"Ubuntu with kernel xxxx on /dev/sdxy\" for the 32-bit install. I'd rather have names like \"Ubuntu 64-bit\" and \"Ubuntu 32-bit\", but that is apparently difficult to do (How can I edit my Grub bootloader entries (Hide, Rename, Remove)? Preferably doing it manually, and not with a program, Bug #439538 “Grub2 don't provide a option for rename menuentry on /etc/default/grub”), as Grub2 seems to autogenerate these names from scripts.\nThen, also the order of boot is set by Grub2 scripts, so if you need to have the default OS to be booted to be the 32-bit, you'll have to count in which order is the desired entry shown at Grub2 boot menu, then use GRUB_DEFAULT=x\n in /etc/default/grub (How do I change the GRUB boot order?) followed by sudo update-grub - again, ran strictly in the 64-bit OS!\nObviously, one will have to be extra careful each time with possibly re-tuning these things each time there is a kernel update in either of the OSs...\n\nA: The bug report on this can be found on launchpad. It is stated there that Debian has beta's for 32-bit EFI. From the link:\n\nWhat's here?\nThis is a fourth build of netinst CDs with experimental EFI support\n  included. For the first time, I've included i386 support as well as\n  just amd64. The amd64 image should boot and work in EFI mode on a\n  recent amd64 (x86_64) machine, doing the following steps differently:\nboot via UEFI rather than BIOS mode\nuse GPT partitioning on hard disks rather than MSDOS\nadd a FAT-formatted EFI partition for booting\ninstall an EFI bootloader rather than lilo/grub-pc\n\n\nIt might be worth an attempt to copy that over to an Ubuntu ISO and try it out.\n", "Q: Newbie to Ubuntu - Need a little Setup help (15.10 won't shut down) So I decided to turn my Laptop from Windwos 8.1 into a dualboot with Ubuntu and thus installed Ubuntu 15.10 through a memory stick. My goal was that I could choose between the OS I want everytime I start up.\nAfter some initial expenditure I seemed to get the OS working fairly well, and thanks to GRUB I can choose the OS I want every time I boot.\nHowever, the one huge issue I could not fix is Ubuntu simply wont shut down. Instead the screen just freezes, so I have to force shutdown everytime by pressing the button.\nWhen starting up, I get an error named \"Secure Boot Violation\" Invalid signature detected. Check Secure Boot Policy in Setup.\nAfter pressing ok the Laptop boots normally however. \nI tried so far:\nchanging\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\ninto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi=force\" \n--> Did not work.\nI reinstalled Grub through Bootrepair and let it run through. \n( /paste.ubuntu.com/15473378 )\n--> Did not work either\nFurthermore, I cannot reboot, I cannot sign out, I cannot log off, and I cannot shutdown by commandline (tried sudo -shutdown -h now) it all results into freezing\nNow before I mess up too much I wanted to ask you guys for help. \nI am using a MSI MS-16H2 Notebook\n\nWhere I suspect the error might be situated in:\nGparted does always give me an error message when I run it, first:\n\"The Argument is invalid, while /dev/sda was positioned for reading.\"\nWhen I click ignore, I get another error called:\n\"The backup GPT table is corrupt, but the primary appears OK, so that will be used.\"\n--> After clicking ok. I can use Gparted normally.\nAfter I ran boot-repair, I was told that I should make sure that the boot-partition is located in /dev/sdc\n--> Now here I think where the error is. \nBecause I find a BOOT-Partition (fat32, /boot/efi) in: \n/dev/mapper/isw/dddegaaaac_RAID0IMSVolume2\nAnd then I find the BIOS_RVY Partition in /dev/sdc\n(where I was told the boot-partition must be)\nDo you guys think this might be the error? And if not, what else might I have to consider so that my Notebook will finally shut down? Furthermore, if I change the Location of the Boot-Partition now, could this harm the Windows-OS?\n--> If someone could tell me how I can rename this Raid's horrible name I'd be quite happy too.\nAlso, there are 2 Disks à 119 GB (/dev/sda and /dev/sdb) which are labelled \"not assigned\" --> I think this is where the initial error message in Gparted comes from. Can I use them or may I not change them because they contain some curcial windows-data or something?\nI posted the Images of Gparted and the Link after boot-repair to make it more clear. \nThanks alot for dealing with my issues.\nGparted 1\nGparted 2\n\nA: Have you tried those steps in order to remove the \"Secure Boot Violation\" error ?\n\n1) Restart your computer\n2) Bring up the BIOS configuration\n3) Go to Security\n4) Select Secure Boot configuration\n5) Switch Secure Boot from enabled to disabled\n\n", "Q: The desktop image moved to one side Question update: The original install was fine.

Many times, these questions were quite (user) specific and answers were created, writing in an improvising way.\nIn some occasions however, things were definitely more developed into a mature result. Some of these questions/answers furthermore, might be useful to a broader range of users, with a nicely integrated GUI, be maintained, updated and easily available and installable by inexperienced users.\nSpecifically, I am thinking of combining (some) of these posts into a easily accessible set of workspace tools or whatever the name would be: this one, this one, this one, maybe this, and this one.\nAlthough I love to update these answers every now and then here, like anyone else I have my limitations (won't tell you which :) ), and a one-person team is not the most professional approach to guarantee a long(er) life of a project.\nSo my question is: how are launchpad teams usually created\n\nEDIT\nNarrowing down the question a bit\nI get the impression many users of AU, actively involved in developing, are also programmers/developers in their daily live. Their daily environment is more or less related to what they do here.\nWith me the situation is quite different. Most of my colleagues do not know at all what I am doing here, have little understanding of-, and no affinity with the subject. In other words; my professional network is not related to programming at all.\nThe most important insight I'd like to gain is if teams (in general) come from existing co operations, brought to Launchpad, or if new teams arise in the virtual world.\n\nA: I would flag it, too broad! I lack the experience to cover many aspects. I salute you because you have special finger print on your answers as the those you have mentioned. Those are really prototypes made here as answers.\nFree Softwares are built by free community. Large softwares have solid core either one, two or many developers. The core team is generally built in real life (social relations+topic interest) or few virtually (topic interest).\nI look to those prototypes as separate projects, each is belongs to you as developer & (OP + Some up voters) as users.\nAt this point forget about the team, you are the core and you will be so and so as the project get bigger and complicated. Those in the virtual team, they will come & go without a notice, most of them they may never contribute code, at best they will submit a bug.\nblaa blaa I can continue talking ... kind of experience resume without much benefits. Try collecting some interest in those projects, and see if it is worthy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a repository on a social git site, popular one MR. Octopus GitHub.\n\n*Update your answer and a link to your new upstream project (keep original code)\n\n*Create a mirror project on Launchpad.\n\n*Prepare Debian packaging\n\n*Publish a PPA\n\n*Update your answer again and add another link to PPA.\n\n\nSo now basically you have upstream project development on GitHub & binary releases on Launchpad.

With free space of less than 1GB, what can you do with the computer anyway?\n", "Q: What is wrong in my SSH key generation?

I have a laptop which is running windows 10 and I want to install Ubuntu on an external HDD and whenever I need it I can just plug it in and boot from the external drive. \nI've followed a tutorial, actually two, and both said that the bootloader has to be installed on the external HDD. This had as a result that I could only access Windows when I had the external HDD plugged in. Whenever I didn't have it plugged in the laptop wouldn't boot and I would just get a black screen with a white line. After fixing my master boot record I could access windows. \nNow I want to try again but I'm afraid that if I install the bootloader on the internal drive that I might somehow delete my windows partition or I will have problems with my bootup.\nSo what should I do?\n\nA: First, it's CRITICAL that you understand your boot mode. Modern computers can boot in either of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS -- This is the old way of booting, which was used on most computers introduced prior to 2011. Modern computers support BIOS-mode booting via a feature called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), aka \"legacy-mode boot support\" or a similar term. Thus, this method can be referred to by three names: BIOS, CSM, or legacy. It involves 16-bit boot loader code splatted in the Master Boot Record (MBR) and various other places. It's an inelegant but mature method of booting, and most sites that don't explicitly mention the boot mode describe BIOS-mode booting. If your computer came with Windows 8 or later, though, chances are it does not use this method of booting.\n\n*EFI/UEFI -- This is the native boot mode for most computers introduced since mid-2011, and it is completely different from BIOS-mode booting, so you should ignore any advice that explicitly states it's for BIOS-mode booting, or anything that doesn't mention the boot mode (since it's likely to be old or written by somebody who doesn't know the difference). One exception: Confusingly, many people, and even computer manufacturers, refer to their EFIs as \"BIOSes.\" This practice creates a great deal of confusion.\n\n\nSince you mention Windows 10, chances are your computer is EFI-based and boots in EFI mode. I'll proceed under that assumption. If this is incorrect, ignore the rest of this answer.\nTo boot an internal disk in EFI mode, the OS typically stores a boot loader as a file on the EFI System Partition (ESP) on the disk. This filename can be anything legal, but for Ubuntu it will be EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi, which in turn launches EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi. The OS installer registers the name of the boot loader with the EFI's built-in boot manager, which stores that name in NVRAM. If the EFI works correctly (not all do), this results in a working boot process.\nThe trouble with this process, as applied to a removable disk, is three-fold:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu installer will install GRUB to \"the\" ESP -- but you may have multiple ESPs available (almost certainly one on the hard disk and maybe one on the USB drive). Controlling where GRUB installs can be tricky. It is not done by using the option marked with the obvious title about where to install GRUB. Instead, it can be done (AFAIK) only from the \"Something Else\" installation option by marking the ESP you want to use as an \"EFI boot partition\" or \"EFI System Partition\" (which name depends on the Ubuntu version).\n\n*If you install GRUB to the ESP on the USB drive, then when you remove the USB drive, the EFI may notice that it's got a registered boot loader entry that's not valid, and delete that entry. Many EFIs do this, and it means that if you install GRUB to an external disk and then unplug it, you lose the ability to boot from that disk, even when you plug the disk back in.\n\n*The way Ubuntu configures GRUB causes it to rely on configuration files that are in the Ubuntu /boot/grub directory, which is not likely to be on the ESP. Thus, if Ubuntu installs GRUB to the ESP on your internal disk, you'll avoid the first problem but run into another one because when you start up with the USB drive disconnected, GRUB will launch and be unable to find its configuration files. The result is a grub> prompt that will mystify most users.\n\n\nThere are a number of solutions to these problems, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manual install of GRUB to the fallback filename on the external disk -- OS installers boot by using a fallback filename of EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. If you copy Shim (which launches GRUB) to this filename (by copying EFI/ubuntu to EFI/BOOT on the ESP and then renaming shimx64.efi to bootx64.efi in EFI/BOOT), your firmware will be able to launch your USB-based GRUB just as it did the Ubuntu installer. This will work past both of the problems I've just identified, but you'll need to use the computer's built-in boot manager to select which OS to boot. This built-in boot manager ranges from unusable to tolerable, so this might or might not be an acceptable solution. You may also need to tweak your boot order after you install Ubuntu to keep it from launching GRUB from either the internal disk's ESP or the external disk's ESP by default.\n\n*Put a /boot partition on your internal disk -- If you install GRUB to the internal disk, then you can also put a /boot partition on the internal disk. This will enable GRUB to work normally on all boots; however, the Ubuntu option will appear all the time, even when the USB disk is unplugged. This may be undesirable, especially if Ubuntu is the default. Also, this solution means that your external USB drive will be bootable only on the computer on which you prepared it. If you want to be able to use that disk on other computers, you should avoid this solution.\n\n*Use a smarter boot manager -- A boot manager gives you a choice of OSes to boot, whereas a boot loader loads a kernel into memory. GRUB does both jobs and the EFI's built-in boot manager does only the first job. There are other boot managers available, some of which may help you avoid the problems I've identified. My own rEFInd, for instance, if installed to the internal disk's ESP and made the default boot program, will detect and present an Ubuntu option if and only if GRUB or a Linux kernel is present -- that is, when the USB drive is plugged in. By setting the default_selection option in refind.conf appropriately, you can configure rEFInd to boot Ubuntu automatically if your Ubuntu USB drive is plugged in and to boot straight to Windows if the Ubuntu USB drive is not plugged in. My answer to this question provides more details about this type of configuration, albeit on a Mac rather than a PC.\n\n\nWith any luck, one of these approaches will get you up and running.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot Ubuntu Live USB/CD\n\n*Plug your external HDD in\n\n*Install Ubuntu at External HDD ( advanced, so you can set where should the boot loader install )\n\n*Config the bios to boot from your external hdd\n\n\nA: You need to install the bootloader on whichever drive your UEFI/BIOS uses to boot. You can change this drive in your BIOS settings, which you can usually access by pressing something like F10, F12, or Del immediately after your computer starts. So as a first step, you can try setting your machine to boot from the external drive rather than the internal drive. If the bootloader is properly installed on the external drive, this should work.\nFor normal everyday use, you'll probably want to always boot from the same drive for the sake of convenience, so you'll want to install the bootloader to your internal drive. Before doing this, though, you should make a backup, preferably a full disk image of your working internal drive. If you encounter problems after installing Ubuntu alongside Windows, the Boot-Repair tool may help.\n\nA: I would install the boot loader on the External device!\nThis way there is no chance of your windows installation corrupting or removing the bootloader.\nIt would be a simple task setting your BIOS to boot:\nUSB-Key\nUSB-Disk\nHDD\netc \netc\n\nNB: MAKE SURE YOU DISABLE SECUREBOOT (if you find that option)\nThis way if you disconnect the external device for some reason it will not pose an issue with your computer.\nAnd: If you stay away from proprietary drivers you'll be able to run this system on other computers...\n(Btw, I would not recomend this type of installation for permanant use as it will be slower than eSATA)\n", "Q: How to get correct Modeline for an external display? There is a Flatron E2042 in the office I work in and it's having the worst [firmware] problem I've ever seen in a display: it can't always work in full resolution.\nToday is the day when it worked and I'd like to get the modeline for the correct resolution. It's not in Xorg.0.log and gtf/cvt are for calculating a modeline. AFAIU xrandr --verbose is showing all the needed numbers but rearranged and not readily available for later use in --newmode. And xvidtune -show lists only the internal display with nothing in the manual about selecting another one.\nSo, any other way to get the current modeline?\nUpdate:\nScript that I now use to make it work:\n#!/bin/bash\nmodeline=\"flatron_e2042 108.00 1600 1624 1704 1800 900 901 904 1000 +hsync +vsync\"\nxrandr --newmode $modeline\nmodename=\"$(echo ${modeline%% *})\"\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 $modename\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode $modename\n\n\nA: Try with xvidtune:\nxvidtune -show\n\n\nA: Not exactly the modeline, but you can download the monitor's EDID information where all supported resolutions are listed. I would use get-edid and parse-edid tools from read-edid package (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/get-edid.1.html). Then try to use the EDID information when starting X instead of asking the monitor for that information every time.\nI know that nvidia driver has very good support for custom EDID file. I am not sure how it is supported in other drivers. I am sure you will figure it out.\nCommands:\nsudo get-edid > ~/lg_edid\nparse-edid < ~/lg_edid\n\n\nA: The accepted answer claims that to get the current ModeLine one should use 'xvidtune' tool. Unfortunately, this program is showing the ModeLine that X server was started with but not the current one. Just try to change resolution (either using 'xrandr' or your window manager monitor controlling tool) and then run 'xvidtune -show' again and you'll see what I'm talking about.\nProbably, a better way to get current ModeLine is using 'xrandr' tool itself like this:\n$ xrandr --verbose\nFor example, in my case the result is something like this (the only lines with the current ModeLine):\n1920x1080 (0x251) 148.500MHz +HSync +VSync *current h: width  1920 start 2008 end 2052 total 2200 skew    0 clock  67.50KHz v: height 1080 start 1084 end 1089 total 1125           clock  60.00Hz\nAs you can see, the current ModeLine is designated by the '*current' mark.\nIn case of using more than one monitor, one would probably need to look for the apropriate section in xrandr's output marked with the output's name to which the monitor in question is connected (something like HDMI-0, DVI-D-0, VGA-0, etc).\n", "Q: Accidentally used replaced Source-list with wrong Ubuntu version I ran these commands:\nsudo wget \"http://pastebin.com/raw/uzhrtg5M\" -O/extras/Source-list\nsudo apt-get update\n\nBut it seems that I have replaced my Source-list with a Source-list of wrong version, since I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS but the source from which I downloaded was for Ubuntu 12.02 LTS.\n\nA: The first command in your question would save a file to /extras/Source-list which would likely error out, doing nothing. But even if it did manage to save, it would almost certainly not be read by Apt (unless you really butchered your configuration).\nIf that is what you ran, no have no issue.\nHowever, if the question is a typo and you actually wrote:\n... -O /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nThat's more significant. If that's the case, I'd fix it by restoring the default, the proper way.\n", "Q: managing keyboard layouts outside unity I would like to know if there is any way of using the standard ubuntu keyboard layouts from outside Unity. I am using a different WM (Fluxbox). \nThe brute force approach would be to use xkb. I can do. But, before I go down that route, I'd like to explore other options. I have tried running the ibus-daemon directly which seems to work, but the keyboard layouts it offers are different from the standard ubuntu ones (and there are much less of them). \nI noticed that i can't just run \n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/indicator-keyboard/indicator-keyboard-service &\n\nAny ideas?\nThe Ubuntu version is 15.10.\n\nA: So, I've decided to stop the impossible and pull out pieces of Unity into Fluxbox. Instead, there is a much more fluxboxy solution, indeed relying on setxkbmap.

Since I am an Emacs user, I prefer to bind Caps Lock to Ctrl functionality (and Ctrl to Caps Lock) , and each time I change the  keyboard layout, I need to repeat the binding process by rereading the .Xmodmap definition. This is nicer if packed into a script, than called directly by the :Exec directive. \nMaybe someone still has a different solution...\n", "Q: apt-offline only install specific packages and don't upgrade/update apt-offline seems like a great tool for installing packages on a non-networked machine.\nHowever, I'm having a problem where it does an update/upgrade instead of just installing the packages that I specified.

Thanks for any help!  \n\nA: The issue\nThe reason that you are getting the \"black screen of death\" in 16.04 is because your graphics card is very new and therefore is only supported by recent versions of drivers. I also believe that you need the proprietary drivers to get NVIDIA 9xx cards working :(\nA temporary solution\nWhen you boot into the live medium, disable kernel mode setting. You can do this by pressing F6 and selecting nomodeset. After this you should be able to boot into the live installer.\n.\nA more permanent solution\nAfter you have installed 16.04, you need to install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers.

For VMWare, under removable devices, check to see if 'Network Adapter' is connected. This was my issue, and I had a similar series of messages as you posted above, except that in dmesg, I had the error 'link is down', which is the same kind of error that you would get if the ethernet is physically disconnected. Stupid mistake, but worth checking. \n", "Q: VirtualBox apache I have created a simple Ubuntu Server on VirtualBox.

But my specific question is this time is calculated at the start or end of the process mentioned in the line?\nWhy this is important?\ntake this example:\n[    4.352025] floppy0: no floppy controllers found\n[    5.718270] random: nonblocking pool is initialized\n[   94.134265] Adding 2094076k swap on /dev/sda5.  Priority:-1 extents:1 across:2094076k FS**\n[   96.988453] init: bootchart main process (274) terminated with status 127\n\nIf the time, is calculated after finishing the process, the process in the 3rd line should be taken responsible for slow boot.\nBut if time is calculated from the beginning of the process, the 2nd line should be taken responsible for it.\nBut it become more complicated when we check dmesg long after boot.\nTake this for example:\n[28047.749604] wlp3s0: associated\n[28941.112855] [drm:intel_pipe_update_end [i915]] *ERROR* Atomic update failure on pipe A (start=757985 end=757986)\n[31407.938694] cfg80211: World regulatory domain updated:\n[31407.938699] cfg80211:  DFS Master region: unset\n\nThis 2466s gap shouldn't have any useful meaning.\nI see many times there is confusion about which line in dmesg should be hold responsible for a slow boot.\nHow can we make sense of time in dmesg?\n\nA: dmesg is not a reliable test of how long a boot-up process goes or where there are bottle-necks. According to Wikipedia page:\n\nWhen initially booted, a computer system loads its kernel into memory.\n  At this stage device drivers present in the kernel are set up to drive\n  relevant hardware. Such drivers, as well as other elements within the\n  kernel, may produce output (\"messages\") reporting both the presence of\n  modules and the values of any parameters adopted\n\nIn other words, dmesg itself  merely collects information, it's the drivers and other system processes that output those messages, and they can output them at any point in time. Between those messages there may or may not have been other processes spawning, so it is not an indicator of how long system boots.\ndmesg also collects messages continuously from the ring buffer, so your 2466s delay does not indicate some hanging process, merely an event occurred 2466s later and whatever process was active at that time just output a kernel message.\nWhat you do want, however , is bootchart , which is used specifically for the purpose of finding bottle-necks in the boot process. I've only seen it being referenced across multiple forums and on this site, but never used myself, so cannot give you more information than that \n\nA: The dmesg command reads the kernel's printk buffer using the user space access mode via /dev/kmsg. Each entry has a monotonic timestamp in microseconds which is set when the log entry is created.\nSo the question can not be, which timestamp dmesg (or the kernel) will log but must be when the kernel will create the log entry for a specific action it does.\nAs I guess, this may differ from action to action. When an event happens to the kernel, i.e. plug in an USB device, the kernel will log this as soon as it has usable information. When the kernel does a planned task, it makes sense to log the results when the job is done. If it is a complex job, maybe it produces some log entries while it runs, but as I guess generally after something interesting has happend or a little amount of time is gone.\nHow you may access the kernel's printk buffer is explained here.\nSo if you specially want to know if a certain entry is logged at the beginning or the end of an action you need to look in the kernel- or module-sorcecode when the program call the log-function.\n\nA: Read man dmesg, especially:  \n   -d, --show-delta\n          Display the timestamp and time delta spent between messages.  If\n          used together with --notime then only the time delta without the\n          timestamp is printed.\n\n\n   -T, --ctime\n          Print  human  readable  timestamps.  The  timestamp   could   be\n          inaccurate!\n\n          The  time  source  used for the logs is not updated after system\n          SUSPEND/RESUME.\n\nThe timestamp value is \"microseconds since boot/1000000\" (looks like \"seconds to 6 decimal places). The timestamp is set to 0 at boot.\nLike @cmks said, the \"microseconds since boot\" value is copied into the log entry when the log entry is inserted into the kernel's buffer. dmesg interprets this value several different ways. dmesg -T -d | less will show the deltas. I did read the Question, and the answer from @cmks\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.4 - Screen is blank with blinking cursor Well now, when trying to force Hatari onto a particular screen, in the process deleting xorg.conf, I seem to have broken everything.\nNow when I try to boot into Ubuntu 14.04.4, everything seems to boot ok, masses of text go by, and then it just sits there with a black screen and a blinking line. I cannot Ctrl + Alt into any of the ttys, nothing gets typed when I press keys, and none of the special keys like the shutdown key work. The only thing that responds is the power button which starts the unattended updates and then the final shutdown sequence.\nI've tried many things short of formatting and reinstalling sda1, simply because I have many repositories and programs installed, and I wish to keep the Classic Gnome session for my login. Unless you know of a way to keep all that (synaptic) information somewhere and once restored will automatically install what's missing?\nThe things I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replaced xorg.conf with one of the backups and .failsafe\n\n*Removed ~/.config/monitors.xml\n\n*Tried generating a new xorg.conf with sudo X -configure through LiveCD giving the error:\nNo devices to configure. Configuration failed.\n(EE) Server terminated with error (2).

By pressing Ctrl + C it ends and resumes normal boot, up to the blank screen.\n\n*fsck - Seems to run, passing through the basic volumes, then doesn't seem to do anything. I've monitored my drive LED but it seems to just stop. By pressing Ctrl + C after a long wait of nothing, it ends and resumes normal boot, up to the blank screen.\n\n*network - Runs for a bit with remounting the file systems, then does nothing for an hour. By pressing Ctrl + C it ends and resumes normal boot, up to the blank screen.\n\n*root - Here I am able to move and copy files around, but X or Xorg, apt-get, dpkg or anything of that nature doesn't seem to exist.\nSo, short of reinstalling everything, what else can I try (be specific where to try it, like LiveCD terminal, chrooted, or recovery mode)?\nNOTE that I can't seem to run the LiveCD's Desktop through \"Try Ubuntu\". I get a black screen with the mouse, and if I wait long enough it would seem the keyboard stops working (can't get into any ttys).\n\nA: Well, by some miracle after doing another reinstall and dpkg-reconfigure of xserver-xorg, all is back to normal now.\n", "Q: How to download and parse a gzipped xml file with qml in Ubuntu Touch?

I'm not a newbie, yet I've been battling this apparently easy issue for a while. I know how to work around it using /etc/environment or other tricks but I want the vars in /etc/default/locale to work ... they simply aren't sourced\nUsing Ubuntu 14.04.4. The current contents of /etc/default/locale are:\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_US:en\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n\nI know I can put those in /etc/environment or /etc/profile etc. Triggering dpkg-reconfigure locales, locale-gen, locale-update have zero effect. I know about all of them.\nSomething that is supposed to source /etc/default/locale is not sourcing it. I can't figure out what. I did reboot too.\nThis is when I ssh into the machine.\n\nA: ... and minutes later I figured it out ... bloody PAM!\nTracked it down by looking at all /etc files sourcing /etc/default/locale and PAM turned up. It sources it in /etc/pam.d/sshd.\nThen I remembered that I only recently disabled PAM in /etc/ssh/sshd_config by commenting the line #UsePAM yes when I wanted to jail sftp users via chroot'ing.\nSolution: Either re-enable PAM in sshd_config, or source /etc/default/locale in /etc/environment, /etc/profile, or ~/.profile\nMods can delete the question and this answer if they wish. I'll leave them in case others fall through the same crack.\nHowever!\nShouldn't this actually be a bug worth reporting to the Ubuntu devs? Shouldn't locale settings be configured on all logins, regardless whether PAM is used on not?\n\nA: Read man ssh, which says (in part), in the ENVIRONMENT section:  \n Additionally, ssh reads ~/.ssh/environment, and adds lines of the format\n “VARNAME=value” to the environment if the file exists and users are\n allowed to change their environment.

At the moment, I am diving into the .deb packaging system. I'm very new to this, so I have a question to you because I couldn't find an accurate answer on other sites.\nAssume I'd like to create a (distributable) .deb package for Software A with pbuilder. The dependencies are libqrencode, libconfig and libABC. For the first to dependencies, there are already packages in the official Ubuntu repositories. So, I only have to add those two libs to the debian/control file (and pbuilder does the rest). But for libABC there's no .deb package in the offical repository and also no PPA etc.\nThe only thing I have is the source code from GitHub for example.\nSo, my question is how should I handle this?\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I have to compile libABC from source on my system? But how do I \"add\" it to pbuilder then?\n\n*Or do I also have to create another .deb package for libABC first? How could I \"add\" it to pbuilder? And what if libABC has dependencies without existing .deb packages as well?\n\n*Or is it a completely different approach?\n\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\nA: What you're trying to do will very likely not work, or will take a lot of effort to get working the way you wish it to.\npbuilder, sbuild, etc. all work within pristine core chroots, which contain certain critical packages inside the chroot to build software.  The problem is, when you pass a source package into either of these, you will end up having to download the dependencies into the chroot, and there's very few ways around this.\nThe only way around this is to go into the chroot of the pristine environment, and then manually install packages for the chroot's Ubuntu distribution (yes, you can have chroots for different versions of Ubuntu lying around on your system).  This gets to be a very huge headache - because not only do you need the dependencies for your package to build, you need the dependencies of the dependencies, plus additional software packages to install for various libraries, coding languages, extra dependencies determined by the system, etc.\nUltimately, I do not advise creating redistributable packages offline without the dependencies available.  Use pbuilder or sbuild or the chroot-based package build environment of your choice, but do it with an Internet connection. Do not try and run chroot-based builds unless you've first modified the chroot on an Internet connection, or use a specifically dedicated system for the building that has selective Internet access to the Ubuntu repositories.\n", "Q: isc-dhcp-server Computers not receiving IP addresses I originally ran isc-dhcp-server on a Raspberry Pi until I deleted /lib by accident.

Much of what I learned when I had to do admin on Unix systems back in the early 90s is coming back to me (and much as changed).\nAnyway, on to the point of my post. Because of the small netbook screen (1024x600), I have my LXPanel at the bottom of the screen set to auto-hide. The problem occurs if I try to use the menu that pops up from the Bluetooth Indicator Applet. Very shortly after I move my mouse off the panel and onto the menu (while still holding down the left button), the panel auto-hides itself, and the menu vanishes. This makes it impossible to use unless I'm really fast navigating to the item I want (which I'm mostly not).\nI think this is a bug in the panel. It should not hide if a menu from something on the panel is open. Or maybe it's a bug in the BIA not informing the panel that the menu is open?\nIs there a way to at least lengthen the auto-hide delay for the panel, as a work-around for this issue? I was unable to find one.\n\nA: For me the simplest work around is to click the applet and use the keyboard to navigate the menu.  I like the binding solution, too.\n\nA: This answer doesn't fix the autohide timeout issue you ask about but is a workaround.\nI suggest you switch off the autohide feature. Instead, you use a \"toggle\" to make lxpanel appear or disappear as you wish.\nUse a text editor to create a file called lxpanel-toggle with the following contents:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nif pgrep lxpanel\nthen \n  pkill lxpanel\nelse \n  lxpanel --profile whatever\nfi\n\nObviously, instead of whatever you'll use the name given in ~/.config/lxpanel, probably Lubuntu.\nYou'll save this file in the folder that holds all your user-level scripts. I keep my scripts in ~/bin which should be in your PATH by default. (You can check that by running env | grep -E \"^PATH\".)\nThen, make lxpanel-toggle executable by right-clicking on it in PCManFM > Properties > Permissions.\nAfter this, edit ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml, making sure you've backed up the file in case of any mishap.\nLook for a unique line that has just </keyboard>. Then, very carefully, paste in the following code just above that line:\n    <keybind key=\"C-S-L\">        # Toggle lxpanel\n      <action name=\"Execute\"><command>/home/your_username/bin/lxpanel-toggle</command></action>\n    </keybind>\n\nwhere you'll replace your_username with your login username.\nSave the modified version of ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml.\nOpen a terminal and run\nopenbox --reconfigure\n\neach time you modify and save lubuntu-rc.xml to make Openbox aware of the changes.\nAfter this, you can toggle lxpanel to appear and disappear at your pleasure by pressing Control+Shift+L. The exact choice of keys is up to you and you need to ensure that the combination isn't already used for some other function.

So, appears options to choose to Install or to Try Ubuntu just as the picture (Options that I See When I Start the Machine ) AND, if I choose to install Ubuntu, and I see the partitions in installation, I see there is still Ubuntu and Windows in Machine. (look the screen picture I took) >> Partition in disk<<.\nWhat can I do??? WILL I Re-install the ubuntu and it will repair the boot? Or I need to do other thing?\n\nA: Make sure you remove all bootable media from devices.  This could include DVDs, SD cards, microSD cards, etc.  That way you cannot boot Ubuntu setup.\nThanks for confirming the microSD presence.  Please remove it and mark this answer accepted if it's right so that others can benefit from this question.\nMoral of the story: Before you get turned on, check all the holes.\n", "Q: Screen Brightness not changing after installing Gnome Desktop Well, finally after the latest 15.10 release and Linux 4.2.0 kernel updates in Ubuntu, my ACPI buttons (Fn + F2/F3) are fixed and can change my screen brightness natively (I was previously using hacky stuffs using macro like commands and binded them to F2/F3). But earlier, I installed GNOME desktop which initially caused my desktop to be black and very slow, that I already fixed by changing from gdm to lightdm and then back to gdm as suggested here in AskUbuntu. Now, I can't change my screen brightness using Fn + F2/F3 keys and also it don't work when changing in the GNOME menu or even in the Settings (which all worked when I was in Unity).\nIf there is anything I need to provide like logs or any useful info, I will gladly give them. Thanks for your help.\nEDIT:\nAs an added note, it is unusual, but Fn+F2/F3 triggers the notification of changing the brightness and it goes up/down but the screen brightness itself is unaffected.\n\nA: Apparently, it looks like gdm or GNOME Desktop itself didn't like the acpi_backlight=vendor line in my /etc/default/grub file. As a side effect, an error about fnfxd.service failing to start appears at boot. I guess that when I switch back to Unity, Fn+F2/F3 keys will not work. But as long as I am in GNOME, I guess this little bit of dirty workaround would do. If there will be someone who can give a better working answer, I'll mark you as the accepted answer. Thanks!\n", "Q: How to stop Ubuntu from launching the Atom editor at startup?

So, it appears my Disks utility on Ubuntu 15.10 thinks my SSD is running at a constant 100°C temperature. And S.M.A.R.T. data seems to be stuck at 30 on temperature, since it doesn't seem to change, ever.\nI've heard many SSDs don't have temperature sensors at all, but why would Ubuntu report it at all? I highly suspect the SSD I literally bought today isn't running at that high a temperature, and that it's a false positive of sorts, but I'd like to know more. Is this normal?\n\n\nA: Since it's 100°C, that's high enough that it's certainly not accurate.\nThe likely explanation is that it's a software bug, due in part to the drive being so new that it's unlikely this software utility had been tested with it.\nYou could try installing the package hddtemp and using the hddtemp tool to check the drive temperature.  There's a chance it'll say the same thing, but maybe not.\nAn SSD is usually not something you'd normally need to worry about getting too hot - they don't usually require active cooling and don't have moving parts.  As long as you have working ventilation/fans in your case it should be fine.  Unless you have some other reason to be concerned, you probably don't need a working temperature indicator on your SSD.\n", "Q: Can I run different versions of Ubuntu in a tab on my Chromebook What I want to know is if I can run unity Ubuntu in a tab on my Chromebook.\nBecause recently I saw one tutorial on 'How-to-Geek' in which they used xfce and did not mention any other versions.\n\nA: Your question is not clear.\nWhat do you mean by tab in 'run different versions of Ubuntu in a tab'.\nIt is apparent that your question is about installing two different desktop environment not different version. If I am right, your answer is YES.\nHow?\nIf you have unity, simply you can install xfce Desktop Enviroment by this commands:\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nThen, in login page, you have option to choose to login to which environment.\n", "Q: What replaces the software center? I get that the software center is going away, but what replaces it? I just installed ubuntu 15.10, mate, and its not here. Is there an alternative hiding some place?

By using Winetricks I'm trying to install some software and I keep getting this error message:\nit says\nsha1sum mismatch! Rename /home/.cache/winetricks/win2ksp4/W2KSP4_EN.EXE and try again.\n\nI don't know what it wants me to rename. I'm confused by this error screen.\nDoes anyone have a fix for this?\nThanks!\n\nA: To install the latest service pack with winehttp, try upgrading your winetricks or try under the latest development version, e.g.\ncurl -o winetricks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks\nsh winetricks winhttp\n\nor one of the following one-liners:\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks | sh -s winhttp\n\nor:\nsh -s winhttp < <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks)\n\n\nA: The most conservative approach to this issue is to do exactly as the error command suggests and rename the file with this single command:\nmv -v /home/.cache/winetricks/win2ksp4/W2KSP4_EN.EXE \\\n      /home/.cache/winetricks/win2ksp4/W2KSP4_EN.EXE_bak\n\nAnd this might be enough. However if the issue recurs you can try an updated copy of winetricks:\nsudo apt-get remove winetricks\nwget  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks\nchmod +x winetricks \nsudo mv -v winetricks /usr/local/bin\n\nAnd then you will have access to the newest version of winetricks which should not contain the 'shasum mismatch' error. The latest version that I have tested (after downloading and installing in this manner) is shown as follows:\nandrew@ilium~$ winetricks --version\n20191224-next - sha256sum: d8ac5e46ad4351faf3a3c6879044d059488001f3dd9364a5651c9e041cb97326\nandrew@ilium~$ \n\nIf this does not work out for you for whatever reason, and you wish to return to the Repository version of winetricks use the following commands in a Terminal screen:\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/winetricks\nsudo apt-get install winetricks\n\nAnd your system will then have returned to default: the Repository version of winetricks...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*WineHQ Wiki: Winetricks\n\nA: One alternative is to modify /usr/bin/winetricks, which is a shell script, to include the updated sha256sum. You should do this only if you are sure that the file in your cache has been properly downloaded.\nIn my case, the error is:\nsha256sum mismatch! Rename /home/coderazzi/.cache/winetricks/PowerPointViewer/PowerPointViewer.exe and try again.\n\nI can check the sha256 sum of this file:\nsha256sum /home/coderazzi/.cache/winetricks/PowerPointViewer/PowerPointViewer.exe\n\nAnd the result is: e17cb384eeac4caf08a4f5d4bceb9697fff83fa942d2a3d9ad0294a9b1774390\nDoing now:\ngrep PowerPointViewer.exe /usr/bin/winetricks\n\nShows a few lines with content:\n...     /PowerPointViewer.exe\" 249473568eba7a1e4f95498acba594e0f42e6581add4dead70c1dfb908a09423\n\nIt can be updated now by replacing the original sum with the new one, just by doing:\nsudo sed -i -e s/249473568eba7a1e4f95498acba594e0f42e6581add4dead70c1dfb908a09423/e17cb384eeac4caf08a4f5d4bceb9697fff83fa942d2a3d9ad0294a9b1774390/g /usr/bin/winetricks\n\nExecuting now winetricks would avoid the original error.\n\nA: Update winetricks to the latest version by running\nsudo winetricks --self-update\n\n", "Q: Can't install python-dev Ubuntu 14.04.3.

Let's say you have something like the following situation: three partitions, one small with OS, and several bigger ones, let's assume all are ext4:\n/            - 10 GB size, 9 GB used, 1 GB free\n/media/disk1 - 100 GB size, 40 GB used, 60 GB free\n/media/disk2 - 100 GB size, 60 GB used, 40 GB free\n\nSo, while the root partition struggles a bit for space, there is generally plenty of free space in the system as such.\nSo, let's assume you want to perform an operation (like doing an apt-get upgrade), which needs a lot of scratch space to create and delete large files. If this process needs say 2GB of disk space, running it and relying only on the 1GB free on the root partition would make the process fail.\nSo is there some sort of a command that I can use, which would basically say to the OS: \"in case of an emergency, you're allowed to use up to 50% on unused free space on any partition on the system\" (clearly, under the assumption that once the calling process causing the emergency has exited, the scratch files on the other partitions are deleted, so the original state is restored) - which would make a process like above succeed, even if the space on the root partition is tight. I guess, this mostly means that the /tmp folder would not extend just on its own partition, but onto others as well.\nIs there anything like this in Ubuntu - or is it even possible under GNU/Linux systems?\n\nA: Ok, here's something - one can reserve hard disk space for use by root user:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/7950/reserved-space-for-root-on-a-filesystem-why\n\nSaving space for important root processes (and possible rescue actions) is one reason.\n\nhttp://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/Partition/\n\nThe -m option is probably the one of most use to non-experts. If the file system becomes filled and there is no more space to write, it is basically unusable because the operating system is constantly writing to disk. By default, five percent of the partition is reserved for use by the root user. This allows root to conduct administrative activities on the partition and perhaps move some data off. However, this is most critical when the partition contains / or home directories. For pure data partitions, this is just lost space. \n\nIt would be nice to know where does this space end up in the filesystem tree...\nUnfortunately, this seems to be a partition-time decision, so apparently there are no commands to modify this from the shell at runtime ?!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.3 slow internet, Toshiba Satellite L15W-B1208X with Intel Pentium N3700 I am brand new here, and while I've played around with Ubuntu before in a different machine, this is my first time on a UEFI machine.

I cannot install them because dpkg and apt-get need a shell to install and there is no shell available. I'm still logged in and my Ubuntu is still running. Is there a way to recover from this situation. By the way, I don't have a Live CD right now.\n\nA: As you currently have a working system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the packages. Normally I'd suggest running apt-get download bash dash but if you have a browser, you can fish them manually from http://packages.ubuntu.com/ Just make sure you get the version for your distribution release and architecture.\n\n*Extract the files you need and put them in the right place. You might need to Alt+F2 to run pkexec nautilus to get root access to write.\n/bin/sh is actually a symlink to /bin/dash. I'm not sure how this is managed (it's a \"diversion\", but I'm not sure by which package) so you might need to manually create the symlink. Again from Alt+F2:\npkexec ln -s /bin/dash /bin/sh\n\nBut I'd also download a LiveCD now while you're at it and get that burnt onto a USB stick. If you've forgotten anything you're going to need that when you reboot.\n\nA: Procedure for dash: \nsudo apt-get download dash #download dash *.deb file\nsudo dpkg-deb -x dash*.deb #extract deb file, a bin directory will be created\nsudo cp ./bin/dash /bin/ #copy binary file to /bin directory\nsudo ln -s /bin/dash /bin/sh #create a symbolic link from sh to dash\n\nNow dash binary is recovered and everything should be OK, but to just to make sure, run this:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall dash\n\nSame procedure for bash, but this time there is no need to create a symbolic link:\nsudo apt-get download bash\nsudo dpk-deb -x bash*.deb\nsudo cp ./bin/bash /bin/\n\nJust to make sure:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall bash\n\n", "Q: Can't update due to full boot disk Apologies, I am aware this is a common question, but I have tried numerous things and still can't get my system to update due to 100% usage of boot disk. \nI have no idea what to do.\nuname -r = 3.16.0-62-generic\n$ df -h\nFilesystem                   Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\nudev                         4.9G   12K  4.9G   1% /dev\ntmpfs                        988M  1.4M  987M   1% /run\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root  107G   62G   40G  62% /\nnone                         4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nnone                         5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone                         4.9G   78M  4.8G   2% /run/shm\nnone                         100M   32K  100M   1% /run/user\n/dev/sda2                    237M  225M     0 100% /boot\n/dev/sda1                    511M  3.4M  508M   1% /boot/efi\n\nIf I try sudo apt-get autoremove, I see:\nReading package lists...

Or can I directly install the software again and the system will automatically recognize that there is an old version of this software installed and overwrite it?\n\nA: The crucial installation option with checkinstall is the --pkgversion option. If this is set correctly:\n\n\n*\n\n*A lesser version of your checkinstall-installed software  will not overwrite a more recent version of your software application\n\n*A more recent version will replace your checkinstall-installed software application\n\n\nIn this way checkinstall integrates very nicely with the Ubuntu package management system, and this system will automatically make room for a checkinstall produced package.\nYou do not necessarily have to specify this option on the commandline as checkinstall will normally do a great job of finding the correct version number...\n", "Q: How can I persistently remap keys in Ubuntu 16.04?

I need to add files to the folder, but the system will not let me unless I use sudo.\nIs it possible to give myself access to modify the folder and its contents, so that I do not need sudo to create files, and so I can use an FTP client to upload files to the web server directly?\nThe web server is Apache2, in case it matters.\n\nA: The /var/www/ folder is touched by the system, and not just the users/administrators, so you should not be messing with these settings on the base /var/www directory unless you know what you're doing.  Typically, with how I run things, I make site-specific directories inside /var/www/, and then give myself permissions there, which solves the issue of the system overwriting site data accidentally (it usually won't mess with subfolders in there of your own creation).\nTherefore, you may instead wish to set up a folder inside of /var/www/ and modify your Apache site DocumentRoot settings to point the website to that subfolder (say, /var/www/mysite/), and then run commands command to give yourself write access, and the web server read access, while blocking other users from accessing.\nFirst, to create the folder, replacing 'mysite' with whatever name you wish to use:\nsudo mkdir /var/www/mysite\n\nSecond, lets give you access, and the WebServer access.  Apache2 runs as www-data by default.\nsudo chown $USER:www-data /var/www/mysite\n\nThirdly, we need to make sure any files created in the folder are automatically given www-data as the group owner (so that it can actually read files it needs to read); we set the \"SetGID\" sticky bit for this.  We also may want to stop other users (except superuser and the web server) from accessing the folder too, in case there's passwords stored in the data that should not be exposed (see my warning at the bottom of the answer):\nsudo chmod g+s /var/www/mysite\nsudo chmod o-rwx /var/www/mysite\n\nFourth, you have to edit your Apache site.  You may be using the 'default' site configuration, if you're new to it.  You'll need to run a set of tasks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the configuration file - usually in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled.\n\n*Edit the configuration files - find the DocumentRoot line, and modify it to say: DocumentRoot /var/www/mysite (replacing 'mysite' with whatever directory name you made.\n\n*Restart Apache - sudo service apache2 restart.\n\n\nOnce you've done all this, you should be able to put documents into /var/www/mysite directly, without sudo (so FTP/SFTP will work), and the web server should have the access permissions it needs for everything inside the site directory.\n\n(Obligatory IT Security warning, because I'm an IT security person)\n\nWARNING!\nWebsite permissions are very evil and depending on what you're using on the site can be almost impossible to get working without a lot more work and effort.  There are also files in some web applications that should NOT be accessible by the world outside of what you must give access to.\nIt is also important to note that web applications are vulnerable to a LOT of potential exploits, so it is critical to keep your site updated with software updates to Apache, but also updates to the software you run on the site (WordPress, for example).\n\n", "Q: Italicized text disappears in Firefox & Thunderbird after a fresh reinstall of Ubuntu 15.10 Gnome, I can no longer see italics in either Firefox or Thunderbird.

That should give us a fairly clear idea of whether it's hardware or software/configuration.\nAnother thing you could also test, especially if you don't have a LiveCD or USB stick, is plugging in a second keyboard to the machine and seeing if the same problem happens on the external keyboard. If not, it's probably something with the internal keyboard on the laptop.\nFrom the proximity of the keys that are misbehaving, it really sounds like some circuit in your keyboard hardware is getting shorted or not making contact. If that is the case, you should be able to get a new keyboard for the laptop. Many times, if you get the exact model of the laptop you can order a new keyboard part.

Is there any way to fix this?\n\nA: The beauty of Chromebooks is that you can do a clean reset of the device if you did something wrong to it, and lose nothing.\nBut from what you have written, I think you are running Crouton rather than a full Linux install - which I would say from experience does not usually result in a very stable computer.\nIf you wish to use Ubuntu full time on your Chromebook, I recommend installing Ubuntu onto the hard-drive directly.\n", "Q: Working with multiple machines I'm very new to Ubuntu and Linux. I have a program that I've written in python that will take a long time to run on one machine; therefore, I've got four additional machines on the way.  They will come pre installed with ubuntu.  To run the program, I need lots of specific python and linux packages (e.g. scipy, pyobdc, etc.).  As the program is updated and modified, I might need additional packages along the way. I also have a bunch of files 1 TB or so that the machines have to work with.  Due to speed considerations, I'd like each machine to have those files stored locally.  \nHere's my question, what tools should I learn to work most efficiently with five machines?  \nI'd like it setup so that I can update all of them simultaneously. Because of the large amount of data that must initially be put on each machine, would I be best served to setup one machine completely and then clone that hard drive to each of the remaining machines drives?\nWhat would be the most efficient way to update all the machines with any additional needed packages once I'm up and running?\n\nA: Quick and dirty: you could look into rsync for the synchronization of files. In the folder you sync you could have a Bash script. Then you could use crontab to syncronize and then run this script at regular intervals.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu MSI GP72.

For instance on Amazon Linux the source function library is in a different location. \nI did not write this app or the init script, its just my job to get it working now.\nCan you help me get this script running smoothly?\nHere is my script \n#!/bin/bash\n# /etc/init.d/wowza2s3\n\n#source function library for Amazon Linux \n#. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions \n\n#source function library for Ubuntu\n. /lib/lsb/init-functions\n\nRETVAL=0\nprog=wowza2s3\nlockfile=/var/lock/subsys/$prog\n\nMONO=/usr/bin/mono\nEXE=/usr/local/WOWZAtoS3/WOWZAtoS3.exe\nPID_FILE=/var/run/wowza2s3.pid\n\nstart()\n{\n        echo -n $\"Starting $prog: \"\n    (exec $MONO $EXE & echo $! >> \"$PID_FILE\") && success || failure\n        RETVAL=$?\n        [ $RETVAL -eq 0 ] && touch $lockfile\n        echo\n        return $RETVAL\n}\nstop()\n{\n        if [ ! -f \"$PID_FILE\" ]; then\n                action $\"Stopping $prog: \" /bin/true\n                return 0\n        fi\n        PID=`cat \"$PID_FILE\"`\n        if [ -n \"$PID\" ]; then\n                /bin/kill \"$PID\" >/dev/null 2>&1\n                RETVAL=$?\n                if [ $RETVAL -ne 0 ]; then\n                        RETVAL=1\n                        action $\"Stopping $prog: \" /bin/false\n                else\n                        action $\"Stopping $prog: \" /bin/true\n                fi\n        else\n                 # failed to read pidfile\n                action $\"Stopping $prog: \" /bin/false\n                RETVAL=4\n        fi\n\n        if [ \"x$runlevel\" = x0 -o \"x$runlevel\" = x6 ] ; then\n            trap '' TERM\n            killall $prog 2>/dev/null\n            trap TERM\n        fi\n        [ $RETVAL -eq 0 ] && rm -f $lockfile\n        rm -f \"$PID_FILE\"\n        return $RETVAL\n}\nrestart() {\n    stop\n    start\n}\nforce_reload() {\n    restart\n}\n\nrh_status() {\n        status -p $PID_FILE mono\n}\n\nrh_status_q() {\n        rh_status >/dev/null 2>&1\n}\n\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n        start)\n                rh_status_q && exit 0\n                start\n                ;;\n        stop)\n                if ! rh_status_q; then\n                        rm -f $lockfile\n                        exit 0\n                fi\n                stop\n                ;;\n        restart)\n                restart\n                ;;\n    force_reload)\n        force_reload\n        ;;\n    status)\n        rh_status\n        ;;\nesac\nexit $RETVAL\n\ncurrently when I run \nservice wowza2s3 start it returns  \nroot@ip-10-0-1-10:~# service wowza2s3 start\nStarting wowza2s3: /etc/init.d/wowza2s3: line 20: success: command not found\n/etc/init.d/wowza2s3: line 20: failure: command not found \n\nalthough it does start the app and it works as intended. \nservice wowza2s3 stop does not return anything and doesn't stop the process \nservice wowza2s3 status returns \nroot@ip-10-0-1-10:~# service wowza2s3 status\nstatus: invalid option: -p\nTry `status --help' for more information.\n\nThanks\n\nA: You mention three errors. The first two are simple enough:\nStarting wowza2s3: /etc/init.d/wowza2s3: line 20: success: command not found\n/etc/init.d/wowza2s3: line 20: failure: command not found \n\nThe success and failure commands are not standard. They are, presumably, some sort of Amazon Linux specific thing. However, based on the context, I can make an educated guess about what they're supposed to do:\n(exec $MONO $EXE & echo $! >> \"$PID_FILE\") && success || failure\n\nThat means \"run a command and then run success if it worked and failure if it didn't. I have no idea why anyone would choose such a convoluted way of writing that. As far as I can tell, that line is equivalent to:\n(exec $MONO $EXE & echo $! >> \"$PID_FILE\")\n\nPresumably, the success and failure programs simply return a 0 (success) and non-0 (failure) exit value. The shell does that anyway though, which is why the line above should be the same. Whatever. If you really need to call an external program for this, use the shell builtins true and false:\n(exec $MONO $EXE & echo $! >> \"$PID_FILE\") && true || false\n\nThe next error is harder to understand. The status program is just a symlink to /sbin/initctl. The version of initctl on Ubuntu doesn't have a -p option. I haven't been able to find the manual of whatever initctl is used on Amazon Linux. Presumably, if you can find it, you can check what the -p option does and figure out the equivalent in Ubuntu's initctl. \n\nA: What I ended up doing was rewriting this script using the upstart system.\nFollowing a guide here \nHere is my code.  Very straight forward for me to understand. \ndescription \"Wowza to S3 service: copies videos to S3 and updating SQL DB records accordingly.

Either that a particular file could not be copied (some .so library file, every time different one) or a generic input/output error:\nThe installer encountered an error copying files to the hard disk:\n[errno 5] input/output error\nThis is often due to a faulty CD/DVD disk or drive, or a faulty hard disk. It may help to clean the CD/DVD, to burn the CD/DVD at a lower speed to clean the CD/DVD drive lens (cleaning kits are often available from electronics suppliers), to check whether the hard disk is old and in need of replacement, or to move the system to a cooler environment.\nObviously, next message is that installation has crashed.\nFirst attempt:\n 1. Create USB startup disk Ubuntu 15.10 on other PC\n 2. Install on ASUS A72F\n 3. Halfway copying files, I/O error\nSecond attempt:\n 1. Create DVD installation disk Ubuntu 14.04 on yet another PC\n 2. Install on ASUS A72F\n 3. Halfway copying files, I/O error\nThird attempt:\n 1. Replace 500GB HDD by 120GB SSD\n 2. Try installing USB (15.10), USB (14.04), DVD (14.04)\n 3. All attempts: Halfway copying files, I/O error\nFourth attempt:\n 1. Return 500GB HDD as internal HD\n 2. Replace DVD drawer with HDD caddy, with the 120GB SSD in it\n 3. Try installing USB (15.10) on SSD which is in the HDD-caddy\n 4. Halfway copying files, I/O error\nSo, used various sources, used various targets (SSD, HDD), used various media slots (SDA, SDB) all with the same result. Even updated BIOS to latest version from ASUS site.\nWhat could POSSIBLY be wrong here?!? Any ideas where I could start looking would be highly appreciated!\n\nA: Found this post, referring to possible MEMORY (RAM) errors causing such errors. Now only trying to run memtest86+ from UEFI boot via USB (not in GRUB options, also not with  key), so that's the next challenge for tomorrow. Pfff.\n", "Q: Additional libraries in Ubuntu Touch (libpng, libfreetype etc.) How do I install & use libfreetype, libpng etc. when developing for Ubuntu Touch? I understand that I need to install them inside chroot. Is there any trick to it, or should I just apt-get install the lot? \nAnd also how do I make CMake find them after I install them? From what I see, scripts like FindFreetype or FindPNG look at specific paths, but libraries and headers in chroot are located at different paths (arm-linux-gnueabihf/...).\n\nA: The chroots are like VMs, so it's just apt-get install inside the chroot. The console of the chroot is accessible through the GUI of the SDK or the schroot command.\nWell-written FindStuff.cmake scripts are finding things correctly (usually they are doing find_library, find_path, pkgconfig, etc.).\n\nA: OK, I got it. Ubuntu IDE uses schroot sessions. Those sessions persist even after you reboot your computer, so if such session was created before you installed software into chroot, Ubuntu IDE won't be able to access this software.\nSo, if you need to install additional libraries into Ubuntu SDK chroot, do the following:\n1) Close Ubuntu IDE\n2) List old chroot sessions:\nschroot --list --all-sessions\n\n2) Kill old click chroot sessions:\nsudo schroot --end-session SESSION_NAME\n\n3) Login into chroot maintenance mode\nsudo click chroot -a armhf -f ubuntu-sdk-15.04 maint\n\n4) apt-get install necessary libraries and/or software\n5) Start Ubuntu IDE again\n", "Q: How long it will take to sort uniq a 62GB file? For 5 hours I ran the command sort file1 | uniq > file2 on a 62GB file and I'm just wondering how long it will take.\nI have a Intel® Core™ i7-4510U CPU @ 2.00GHz × 4 with 8GB RAM.\nIt will be faster if I'll run sort --parallel=4 -uo file2 file1?\n\nA: It will take a long time. The exact time depends on a lot of things, like whether the file has a lot of duplicate lines or whether it's already sorted or very disordered. There's no way to tell from your system specs.\nYes, the last command will be much faster, especially since it can drop duplicates as it works rather than having to hang on to them. However, you need file2 file1 on the end since the argument to -o's option comes right after -o.\nSee also another answer that adds in nice and ionice to speed things up at the expense of slowing everything else down (perhaps to the point of freezing other tasks).\n", "Q: Brother QL 570 will not print I've set up my Brother QL 570 label printer, installed all the drivers using terminal and verified that they've been installed correctly using the 'dpkg -l  | grep Brother' command. \nI've tried printing with Libre Office Writer and gLabels but I'm not getting anywhere. With gLabels, I can select exactly the label type that I have installed in the printer so there shouldn't be any issues with printing outside of margins etc, which may of prevented printing. \nThe printer appears on System Settings okay. The status is at Idle until when I try to print a test page then it displays 'Processing - Sending data to printer' for a second or so then it changes to 'Idle - 'Sending data to printer' and then remains with that status with no further activity. No test page is produced from doing this.\nDo I need to change any settings elsewhere perhaps? This is the the last thing that is holding me back from switching fully from Windows to Ubuntu, something I'm very keen to do, and I can't wait to get this working! :)\nThanks in advance! :)\nPaul.\n\nA: I've found the solution to this problem in the German Ubuntu forum. It is quite simple:\nInstall the package lib32stdc++6 and you're good to go.\nsudo apt get install lib32stdc++6\nOne addition: to make use of custom sized labels, have a look at \nbrpapertoollpr_ql570, which can add media size definitions to your printer configuration.\nRegards\nDirk\n", "Q: 14.04 High Load Average - but no CPU I've got as system with 6 hperthreaded cores and 64Gb of RAM, just stood up 14.04 wit KVM, and I'm seeing load averages above 50, with only a VM install going on.

I have no idea why that is?\nmy desktop showing terminal and file manager\n\nA: The problem is that your file manager and the terminal are looking at two different directories. There is one /usr/local located on the 118GB volume, and another that is located in your root partition. If you click on Computer in the file manager, and navigate to /usr/local, then you will be looking at the same directory as the terminal. Alternatively, if you navigate to the 118GB volume, and then /usr/local/ in the terminal, you will be looking at the directory that is shown in the file manager. In Ubuntu, automatically mounted partitions can usually be found in /media/.\n", "Q: Control C doesn't work in Ubuntu 14.04 In both gnome-terminal and terminator, press ctrl+c doesn't do ANYTHING.

I do this all day remaking these drive from corruptions. Just replacing the casper-rw file doesn't really. I have hundreds of 4gb sticks, the 8gb sticks would cost money, and I'd still have the 4gb sticks.\nnow my questions:\n1)Would a set-up like this work?\n2)What file format does the 1024mb SWAP file need to be in.\n3)What is the procedure for telling the grub, or file, to use the partition as a swap?\nAdditional information: This is the only HDD on the system, so it will always be SDA\n\nA: Yes, that would work, though I think it's not enough space for a GUI unless you use something like Lubuntu, which might or might not work.\nThe swap would be an entire partition with no format; the partition type would simply be set to swap rather than, say, ext4.\nYou don't tell GRUB about the swap partition, since GRUB only cares about the earliest parts of booting the operating system. Instead, you tell Linux by editing /etc/fstab to say what partition to use (see your own system's /etc/fstab for an example; it'll have a line mentioning swap). Use sudo blkid after booting froto get the proper UUID for your USB drive's swap partition.\n", "Q: How to recursively and automatically convert all bmp images to png files in a given directory? I have a directory on my machine with 100s of images in it. About half of those images are bmp files, and the other half are png files. I need to convert all the bmps into pngs, but as there are so many of them I don't want to do it manually.\nSo how can I recursively and automatically (probably using a script) convert all the bmp image files into png image files in that directory?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: I'd say the answer by andrew.46 is still the best, being it is an eloquent on-liner. However, here is another option. The only advantage is that there is a \"current file number count\" out of \"total number of files\" to convert, and it echoes the file being converted. You'll want to remove any spaces in file names though before running. This will remove spaces: find . -name \"* *\" | rename 's/ /-/g'\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd $(pwd)    \nbmp_files=$(find . -iname \"*.bmp\")\n\ntotal=$(echo \"$bmp_files\" | wc -l)\nnum=0\n\necho \"There are $total files to be converted.\"\n\nfor f in $bmp_files\ndo\n    ((num++))\n    echo \"Converting $f, $num/$total\"   \n    convert \"$f\" \"${f%.bmp}.png\" \n    clear\ndone\n\n\nA: A simple for loop might be enough for a single directory:\nfor i in *.bmp\ndo \nconvert $i \"${i%.bmp}.png\"\ndone\n\nTo make this truly recursive there are a few choices, one method is the following:\nfind . -name '*.bmp' -type f -exec bash -c 'convert \"$0\" \"${0%.bmp}.png\"' {} \\;\n\nIf you wish to dabble a bit more you specify a quality level for the png level by using the syntax:\n-quality value\n\nThis takes a value of 1 for the lowest quality and smallest file size to 100 for the greatest quality and largest file size. The default is approximately 92.

(as in the picture)\n\nWhat other dock applications have this same property?\n\nA: Cairo-Dock\nsudo apt-get install cairo-dock-core\n\nBY default press Super+Return (you can change this by configuration menu) to activate keyboard control. Then you can navigate by typing numbers.\n\nIf you want to change the shortcut for keyboard control: Right click on the dock - Configure - Configuration - Shortkeys.\n\nA: Call me an i3 fanboy, I don't care :) \nMy solution (no dock at all): You want a bit geeky, use the i3 tiling window manager. It is very customizable. I am using it and never regret the change.\nhttp://i3wm.org/\nA demo and start up guide here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4\n\nA: You can try synapse.  It works similar to Unity to find apps or even documents.  I typed \"fir\" and the list gets smaller as you type more.  It is quite useful if you have Lubuntu.\nYou can also install cairo-dock to get an Apple look and feel.  \nsudo apt-get install cairo-dock\n\nI could not get it to work from the standard repository.\nBut this worked nicely.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:synapse-core/ppa \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install synapse\n\nTry the suckless-tools package. It includes dmenu, which is ultra fast. You can set up a keyboard shortcut to activate it. Even the super key, but you may lose other super key functions. Install like so:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install suckless-tools\n\nThen create a script called dmenu-run.sh which will generate a menu. For example:\n#!/bin/bash \ndmenu_run -b -i -fn '10x20' \\ -nb '#000000' -nf '#ffffff' -sb '#d64937' -sf '#000000' \n\nMake the script executable, then make a keyboard shortcut as you wish, to call the script.\nThis combined with cairo-dock is a decent combo I use on Lubuntu for the same reasons: I like to type to call my apps. dmenu is super fast too.\nWarning: it is geeky and ugly. This might be a stepping stone to Lubuntu or Xfce Desktop as well where fast matters more than looks. Xfce has a launcher dock at the bottom. Ugly, but fast. If you combine it with dmenu, you will be quite happy.\nYou could also install Gnome Desktop which also has a typing launcher too via the super button. I think Gnome or Xfce will do the trick for you. Or combine either of them with Cairo if you want an Apple-like dock.\n", "Q: How to extend a path?

The system will become aware of any changes made.\nJust restart\nYou should not need to change anything.\nBy default ld.so.conf has include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf. This commands makes the file include the contents of anyfile under /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ that ends with .conf, which includes include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf which says:\n# libc default configuration`\n/usr/local/lib\n\nErgo I don't think you should need to add anything. Just restart your computer to let the software load any changes you have made. Although in most cases you just need to restart the specific service I am uncertain as to what you are changing here. A full system restart should do the trick though.\nIf your computer is missing libc.conf\nIf by any chance libc.conf is missing then create a file mylibc.conf to remember that you added this yourself. This file will contain the command to add /usr/local/lib. \nOpen terminal and execute:\nsudo echo \"/usr/local/lib\" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/mylibc.conf\n\nBy the contents of ld.so.conf this file should make the system be load /usr/local/lib automatically.\n", "Q: How to copy multiple urls hidden under texts, by selection in webpages?

Why is this not performing arithmetic using expr?\n\nA: Explanation of errors\nThe error is the same as if you input:\n$ expr 10.5 + 11.8\nexpr: non-integer argument\n\nExpr is complaining that you gave it non-integers. This is because expr program was not designed for non-integer calculations:\nExpr invocation:\n\nOperands are either integers or strings.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*expr was generated as standard error, your terminal just displays it\n\n*But when you use pipe |, pipe only transfers  standard out, not standard error\n\n*Because bc did not receive anything to work with, it didn't give you any output at all, as you can see when you try sending nothing (except new-line) to bc:\n$ echo | bc\n\nThe result is bc says nothing. So what you see on your screen with your original command, was still just expr's complaint via standard error.\nRecommendation\nFor decimal calculations, you can use just bc and some means to get input to bc, such as with here-strings:\n$ bc <<< '10.5 + 11.8'\n22.3\n\nOr, to use variables:\n$ a=10.5\n$ b=11.8\n$ c=$(bc <<< \"$a + $b\")\n$ echo $c\n22.3\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The $( and ) is a command substitution\n\n*<<< string is a here-string syntax, sends the string contents to stdin, which bc receives\n\n\nA: info coreutils 'expr invocation' says:  \n16.4 `expr': Evaluate expressions\n=================================\n\n`expr' evaluates an expression and writes the result on standard\noutput.  Each token of the expression must be a separate argument.\n\n   Operands are either integers or strings.  Integers consist of one or\nmore decimal digits, with an optional leading `-'.  `expr' converts\nanything appearing in an operand position to an integer or a string\ndepending on the operation being applied to it.\n\nHowever, you can use bc:  \n$ a=10.5 b=11.8 c=$(echo \"scale=1;$a + $b\" | bc -q );echo $c\n22.3\n\n", "Q: Telegram stopped loading on BQ Aquaris E5 HD I have been using Telegram on my BQ Aquaris E5 HD since I have had it and all has been working OK.\nAfter an update I now get notifications that I have a new messages (all OK).

Thus, I was prompted to start searching for drivers for my wireless adapter (formally called the mini wireless n usb adapter, which brought up more results regarding this error).\nI came across this website which had drivers for my particular adapter.\nAfter following there instructions on how to install the driver, I rebooted and started using the internet. The only step I did differently was I just performed\nsudo nautilus\n\nWhich made transferring the driver files to where they needed to be a bit more user friendly.\n", "Q: Suddenly can't connect to my home network (WiFi) I've been using Ubuntu on my laptop for about 8 months, and have never had a problem connecting to my home wireless network. But all of a sudden, I am unable to connect. I can see the network, and the system still automatically tries to connect, but it just keeps trying (unsuccessfully) to connect. I have taken a look at similar questions, but have not been able to solve the problem. \nNote: I can still connect to other WiFi networks (like at school)\nAny support is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Silly first steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you tried restarting your home router? I know this might be a silly comment but sometimes is just the router. Disconnect from the wall and reconnect if necessary.\n\n*Verify that the password was not changed by a family member or friend. Might be as simple as that. \n\n*Delete the connection...\n\n\nDelete the connection\nGo to the network indicator (indicators are the icon applets in the top right: volume, network, clock/calendar, etc...):\nEnter into Edit connections...\nSelect your home network on the list and press Delete.\nTry to connect again entering the information as needed.\nStill not working?\nLet me know and will try to help further.\n\nA: 1st suggestion\nVerify that password. Every one makes mistakes... fortunately, passwords have zero tolerance for mistakes :) Also, make sure the security type is correctly set (WPA, WPA2, WEP, etc.)\n2nd suggestion\nIf you own other devices that ARE able to connect, check their gateway, subnet, IP, DNS information and try manually setting your laptop with the same information but w/a different IP. Verify there are no other devices on your network fighting over the same IP address. (If you don't own any other devices, hard wire your laptop with an ethernet cord and note the same information then manually set the WIFI connection)\n3rd suggestion\nYou may have possibly installed another kernel during an update/upgrade that broke your wireless. First open up a terminal and type:\nuname -r\n\nWrite down the output on paper or other device. Next, type:\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image\n\nIf you see more than one kernel installed: reboot your computer, but keep pressing Shift as your computer is starting so you can get to your GRUB menu. From there, use the arrow buttons to select a different kernel (than the one you wrote down) to boot from and see if anything changes.\nBTW\nDo you administer your router?\nAlso,\nHave you tried booting from a live cd/usb & trying to establish a WIFI connection?\n\nA: I got this resolved by changing the channel on my WiFi router (in my case from channel 3 to 9). Funnily enough, after switching back to channel 3 again, Ubuntu could connect to the same WiFi on the old channel again. ¯_(ツ)_/¯\nI got the solution from this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/1177749/119592\n\nA: For new readers:\nsometimes we ignore possible problems around ourselves(E.g. wrong password):\nmake sure Access Control option is disable or modified on your router. or you can solve this problem by changing WiFi channel as mentioned before.\n", "Q: Can't display the thumbnails of HEVC Main10P and VP9 codec video I hate totem player, it is useless to me, so I installed the ffmpegthumbnailer, removed totem player, and changed the default thumbnailer to it by following steps.\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg ffmpegthumbnailer gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg\n\nThen deleted thumbnail cache:\nrm ~/.thumbnails/fail/gnome-thumbnail-factory/*\nrm ~/.thumbnails/normal/*\n\nI then made a change in /usr/share/thumbnailers/totem.thumbnailer\nfrom this:\n[Thumbnailer Entry]\nTryExec=/usr/bin/totem-video-thumbnailer\nExec=/usr/bin/totem-video-thumbnailer -s %s %u %o\n\nto this:\n[Thumbnailer Entry]\nTryExec=ffmpegthumbnailer\nExec=ffmpegthumbnailer -s %s -i %i -o %o -c png -f -t 10\n\nBut it can't generate the thumbnails from HEVC Main10P and VP9 codec videos, what should I do?\n\n\n\nA: I have found the answer, I need to install the newer version of ffmpegthumbnailer and libffmpegthumbnailer4.\nhttps://launchpad.net/~mc3man/+archive/ubuntu/testing6/+build/7730885\nJust download them and install.\n", "Q: Virtual box uninstall I want to uninstall virtual box from my system. \nI run following command:\nsudo apt-get remove virtualbox* --purge\n\nThe result says it is uninstalled. But I could still launch the virtual box. Please let me know what needs to be done. Thanks\n\nA: It sounds like you installed VirtualBox from an installer file instead of from an apt repository--possibly in addition to installing from an apt repository (the latter you seem to have already removed, if it existed).  If the VirtualBox version is 2.2.2 or later, you can do this:\nsudo /opt/VirtualBox/uninstall.sh\n\nIf it's an earlier version (2.2.1 or earlier), you need to find the installer file you downloaded (or re-download it) and run this from the same directory as that file:\n./VirtualBox.run uninstall\n\nIf you can't find the appropriate installer file for a version 2.2.1 or earlier, then you need to remove all the files, manually.  To do this, perform the \"manual installation\" steps in reverse order, deleting files instead of creating/moving/copying them, deleting symlinks instead of creating them, removing edits to configuration files, etc.:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html#idp46457698198016\n", "Q: sudo apt-get update fails on postgresql I am trying to install nodejs but it keeps on failing.

This is because ubuntu 15.04 vivid vervet is at it's end of life (see wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases#End_of_life). \nSolution 1: Upgrade your Ubuntu OS to 16.04.\nThis version should be stable for a long time (~2021), and so is likely to remain supported by Node for a similar duration.  Then you'd have to update the ppa you're using and sudo apt-get update.\nStill, that's a lot of work. You could try\nSolution 2: install from source or debian packages.\nThe instructions on nodejs.org seem pretty comprehensive.

If I were to install 16.04 beta now, would it be easy to upgrade to the official release in April? Also, how stable is the current beta2 build? Is installing it substantially risky despite it being so late in the development cycle?\n\nA: In my experience, the beta version of Ubuntu will either upgrade automatically to the release or ask you if you want to do so via the update manager, once the release comes out.

I still wonder if Google realise there is a 64-bit version of 12.04...\n\nA: Chrome or Chromium do not support Ubuntu 12.04 any more.\nIt is not a kernel issue. It is a dependencies issue with the DE packages.\n\nA: The previous answer doesn't explain why I am happily responding on the latest version of Chrome.  However I think I found possible explanation.  It still works because I have Chromium and Chrome installed.  Chrome seems to depend on part of the Chromium install or settings.  When I uninstalled Chromium, Chrome required a fresh sign in every time I opened it and said my profile couldn't be opened properly.  I doubt it would work if you tried a fresh install of Chrome on 12.04, but installing Chromium as well might be worth a try.  Or of course upgrade to 14.04/16.04, I just have reasons for not wanting to do that right now.

However, left alt do work with other keyboard shortcuts like ctrl+left alt+T. I have tried different keyboard layouts and to look for suitable options in system preferences -> text entry. I did notice that there are similar questions to mine, but they involve special characters using left ctrlleft alt, and not left shiftleft alt.

The commands like connect, disconnect work in very erratic fashion, sometimes not responding  at all.  If I try to retrieve tables or schema it occasionally hangs. \nI have used MySQL workbench to create the databases. However, creating / updating the database structures from Netbeans itself takes too much time.\nEarlier I had Netbeans 8.0, had the same problem so have installed Netbeans 8.1. \nNetbeans comes by default with Derby database and have had no problems with Derby  Database.\nAre there any parameters that need to be set for MYSQL to work correctly with Netbeans?\n\nA: Can you check what is the connector that NetBeans is using to connect to MySQL? It might be the slow connector for MySQL which might be causing the slowness.\nYou can get the latest MySQL connector from here\nMoreover when you are connecting to MySQL from Workbench you are connecting via SSH Tunnel which is way too faster. \nApache Derby is in-memory database so comparing it to connect to MySQL from Netbeans IDE is a not very relevant. But if you are connecting to Derby and MySQL from NetBeans via JDBC driver then it's comparable...most probably you need to focus on the MySQL connector that is being used in NetBeans IDE to connect to MySQL.\nWhen i am connecting to MySQL from the Java IDEs...i generally do all the DDL operations from the MySQL shell and only DML operations i perform from the Java IDE(via Java programs).\n", "Q: Core i5 4200u, can it handle Ubuntu? i'm running Windows 10 on a laptop, upgraded from 8 to 8.1 then 10, cpu is\ncore i5 4200u, can it handle Ubuntu?\nif i installed 15.10, can i upgrade to 16.04 LTS when it comes out?\n\nA: Yes your i5 can surely handle ubuntu 15.10 and 16.04.

While, it will be much slower than clonezilla's own mechanism for cloning, it will make a replica regardless of type.\n*If Clonezilla fails, you can opt to clone the drive using dd directly.  It can take much longer to do but will ignore file system types.\n\nClone a Drive\nClone the contents of a whole hard drive onto another completely different drive.  You need to do this while booting a live disc, you will need the drives unmounted.\nif=source and of=destination\n\nBe extra careful and check the command over before submitting it.  Having the input and output parameters incorrectly set would be very bad.\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb\n\nAfter you clone to the larger drive, depending on how the partitions are setup, you may be able to run a live ubuntu disc, and use gparted to grow the partition.  I have difficulties saying with certainty as the location of the partition will make a difference.  If the partition you plan to grow is between other partitions it will technically have nowhere to grow.  If it's the last partition you should have no problems.\n", "Q: Software Center Crashing, Im getting annoyed I'm running Ubuntu 15.01 or something like that, I just installed it yesterday.\nAnywho, when I try to open the Software center it immediately crashes.

It's recommended that you use a Download Manager, specially if your connection to the Internet is unstable.\nA good way to download it quickly (And help canonical save some bandwith) is to use a BitTorrent client.\nOne of the most popular is µTorrent, here's a link to the win version:\nhttp://www.utorrent.com/intl/en/downloads/win\nAnd here's a link to the Ubuntu alternative downloads (Scroll down to see the BitTorrent Links):\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads \n(Remember to leave the client open after you download the .iso, to help seed the file to your fellow users.)\nIf you prefer to download it through your Internet browser, there's a few great download manager extensions for both Firefox or Chrome (Just search them up!).\n", "Q: How can I fix \"W: <...> The repository is insufficiently signed by the key <...> (weak digest)\" in my private repository? I maintain a series of private repositories.  The gpg keys used to sign the repo were made with \"Key-Type: RSA\" and \"Key-Length: 4096\".  The version of GPG used to generate the keys is 1.4.16 on Ubuntu 14.04.  The machine that complains has gpg 1.4.20 (on a beta of 16.04).\nHow can I fix \"W: <...> The repository is insufficiently signed by the key <...> (weak digest)\" in my private repository?\nI'll admit that I don't konw too much about encryption, but I would have thought that 4096-length RSA key would have been sufficient.\n\nA: The warning message is not about the encryption algorithm (4k RSA keys are considered totally fine and best practice right now). The digest algorithm is something else though: the hashing algorithm applied on the message body (in your case, the packages or package lists) which are then signed. GnuPG has rather conservative defaults to stay compatible, but those are slowly outpaced by progresses made in cryptanalysis.\nYou do not have to create a new key, but simply change the settings for GnuPG. The proposals by the Debian-administrator blog are still fine and help you setting reasonable defaults which are rather a little bit overcautious:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up the preferences to be used by GnuPG (for signing messages, encrypting to others, ...):\ncat >>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf <<EOF\npersonal-digest-preferences SHA256\ncert-digest-algo SHA256\ndefault-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed\nEOF\n\n\n*Setting preferred algorithms in your key to be used by others (at the same time adds a new self-signature with the updated settings from #1 above):\n$ gpg --edit-key $KEYID\nCommand> setpref SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed\nCommand> save\n\nIn future, digest algorithms considered secure should be chosen by GnuPG.\n", "Q: Capture frames from webcam I have a USB webcam that has a frame rate of 30 frames/sec.

Something like the \"cu\" command.\nUpdate:\nAfter some research, I found that the following command does the job for 1 fps:\nfswebcam -q -l 1 --fps 1 /home/user/%H-%M-%S.jpeg\n\nThe issue now is that upon increasing the fps rate, I am not sure how to update the files names accordingly. I tried the following:\nfswebcam -q -l 1 --fps 30 /home/user/%H-%M-%S-%N.jpeg\n\nbut this seems not working. (%N is for the nanoseconds).\n\nA: This doesn't directly answer your question but kind of meets it halfway. You can install something like OBS Studio to record video.

I once installed the nvidia drivers (nvidia-355) and then after a few days I installed Gnome 3.10. It kept complaining about some dependency problem so I figured it'd be something that I perhaps made a mistake with.

Now every time I open Nvidia settings and try to switch to the Nivida graphics card other than the integrated Intel card (yes its on a laptop), I get this error message similar to the one shown here. In fact, its the exact same error. Now the funny part is, if I uninstall gnome, I'm able to use the nvidia card. But when I reinstall it back using gnome-shell, the same problem pops up again.

But I don't want to reformat the hard drive until I am satisfied Ubuntu is what I really want to use.  So, the plan is to use the USB setup for a few weeks until I've made a final decision as to which operating system I prefer.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, heavy I/O usage should logically 'Reduce the lifespan of the flash drive'.\n\n*Probably not. You'll loose a bit of non-synced data, and might need to run the filesystem check.\n\n*Yes. USB2 is much slower then SATA interface, ...USB3 is better, but still, many flash drives are not as fast as HDDs.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Yes, do it. Stop worrying. As for your concerns:\nReduce the lifespan of the drive: Yes, technically, but not such that you would likely notice. It's fine. It's been 10 years since I've worried about this issue with flash. I've never had a problem. I've used a SanDisk Extreme 32GB USB3 flash drive as a 24-hours a day security video recorder for weeks at a time. I've had no issues with it.\nCause unrecoverable damage: Do you mean to the USB flash drive or to your primary internal drive? In either case, no. Journaled filesystems will recover. You might loose some of the last data that was being written to disk. You won't cause permanent physical damage. The OS will reboot and recover quickly.\nDramatically decrease the system's overall performance: No. I would be surprised if you would even notice the difference. Even USB2 speeds are usable. The SanDisk Ultra Fit is not the fastest USB flash drive that SanDisk makes, but it's likely faster than most mechanical hard drives you would stick in your laptop.\n", "Q: CTL-480 and Ubuntu 14.10 LTS I have a CTL-480 Wacom tablet, and I can \"use it\", I mean, it detects the pen entry and the contact, but when I enter the wacom config on the system preferences, it says that no wacom tablet was detected.

How can I check the technical info on my notebook with Ubuntu 14.04?\nI would like to check the dimension and if is IDLE or SATA\n\nA: The utility hdparm is IMHO the best tool for this job. Simply run as follows:\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sda\n\nand you will have more than enough information on your HDD. There are many options available (see in the reference at the base of this post), I have given:\n-I   Detailed/current information directly from drive\n\nhdparm is part of a default installation on Trusty Tahr so no extra installation required...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*hdparm man pages\n", "Q: how to recover contents from home folder if ubuntu fails to boot and requires reinstallation? i installed my IDE and have project on default home folder now in case ubuntu fails to boot how shall i recover contents from home folder. if make live USB ubuntu then it shows fresh home folder and doesn't show previous contents and if i reinstall it my previous contents might be deleted.What other option i have other than shifting my contents to other partition?\n\nA: You can boot from a Live CD (Or USB Stick), mount the partition and access any files stored in it.\nSo, unless you format the partition, you won't lose any of your data in case Ubuntu fails to boot for any reason.\nBut, if you're planning on toying/learning about Ubuntu (Or Linux in general), you should run a Virtual Box or create a separate partition, to avoid damaging any important data you may have.\nIn any case, it is a good practice to often backup your data in an external drive, as (Albeit small) there is a chance any file system will fail.\n", "Q: mdadm raid 1 to raid 0 (or lvm...) I currently have a machine with 2x3TB in software raid 1 (mdadm, Ubuntu 15.04). I would prefer to keep the data on the disks, but I can risk losing it.\nAre there any options to migrate without reinstall to a 6TB configuration (raid0, lvm...)?\n\nA: For reference, I ended up failing the 2nd disk, formatting and reinstalling with an lvm partition. I stopped the array, and retrieved data from the ext4 partition (not the raid device).\nThen I migrated the content to the lvm partition, formatted the 1st disk, and extending the lvm.\nThere was probably an easier way to go (migrating the OS partition for example), but it worked out just fine.\n", "Q: Touchpad doesn't work after suspending the computer As the title says, I am dealing with this annoying problem in my laptop (ASUS X455L) with Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 LTS. Since I do not know a lot about computers I would be grateful if someone could tell me in the easiest possible way how to solve this. I've read in a couple of other forums that to solve this I should create a file named 10_reset_psmouse in /etc/pm/sleep.d/ with the following code in it:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Action script ensure that psmouse works before a hibernate\n# Licence GPL2\n\nPATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin\nSELF=reset-psmouse\n\n# On suspend|hibernate, reset psmouse\n\ncase \"${1}\" in\nhibernate)\n# nothing\n;;\nresume|thaw)\nrmmod psmouse;\nmodprobe psmouse\n;;\nesac\n\nI was not successful when I tried this, if any of you come with a new idea it would be great.\n\nA: The first thing your should do is upgrade your linux kernel to 4.4 stable.\nGoogle the instructions.

I haven't found much recent discussion on this topic but the thread I was following was:\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=166210\nmy /.Xdefaults looks like:\nURxvt*iconFile: /usr/share/icons/Numix-Circle/scalable/apps/xterm-color.svg\n\nwhen starting URxvt through my current terminal with rxvt-unicode I receive: \"urxvt: Loading image icon failed, continuing without.\"\n\nA: I was able to pretty much fix my problem. I made edits to the rxvt-unicode.desktop file changing the icon to one of my choosing. At that point I was able to see the new icon when loading rxvt-unicode from the unity launcher or sidebar. Information on finding the .desktop files can be found here: How can I find *.desktop files?\nOne thing I noticed though is if I use another terminal to launch rxvt-unicode it still shows the old icon. Not sure yet why that is happening. This only has become a problem because I created a keyboard shortcut to make Super+q launch a terminal and it does that through the terminal as far as I can tell.\n", "Q: Ubuntu boots to a blank screen after fresh install I want to remove Windows 7 from my existing system and do a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.10 LTS. I have given this a few attempts and and I have chosen the option that says \"Erase everything and Install Ubuntu.\" \nIt then prompted me to reboot. After a reboot, nothing appears to be loaded and it's stuck on a black screen with a blinking typing bar and its not interactive!\nI can't load up the boot menu because nothing appears to be loading. \n\nA: A few possible things to try (some of these have already been suggested, but for completeness are included):\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your BIOS settings that your chosen hard drive is still the boot device\n\n*Boot to a Ubuntu Live CD (instead of installing Ubuntu, click the \"Try Ubuntu\" option instead\n\n*In the Live \"Try Ubuntu\" mode, check the boot drive by running \"Disks\" and check it is marked as bootable\n\n*Check grub installation and settings (maybe someone can add some hints here)\n\n*Try the install again and pay careful and particular care around the last option of where to install grub, my guess is that is where your problem is. The system is unbootable because it doesn't know where to look*\n\n\n*If you try the reinstall method, be careful where you install grub. Make sure it is your local hard drive, and not the USB key, or a partition of the harddrive. I typically (and think the best practice may be to) install it to the primary boot device and not in any particular partition. For me with a USB key in the computer this is usually /dev/sdb since sda will be the usb key (although it could be reversed (maybe)\nas an aside, I find installing anything much easier if you remove all the hard drives and leave only the hard drive you are going to install onto. This:\n\n\n*\n\n*removes the chances of error (wiping the wrong drive for example)\n\n*leaves you with only one real place to install grub (and it's not the key)\n\n\nOnce you do a clean boot, you can shut down and reinstall any extra/data drives\n\nA: likely to be a uefi setting which is supported by Ubuntu.  The ubuntu install program should tell you this, but they do not.\nGo to your Bios and enter security settings.\nThen you need to type a password to change things (on acer).\nBE VERY CAREFUL!  remember this password.\nSelect, to add trusted uefi and it will bring you to some directory.  Select that directory and ubuntu until you see efi files.\nreboot and hopefully you will be all set to go.  When you are finished, go back to security settings and change the password back to . (like type nothing).  This will clear boot security.\nEnter bios setup a few more times and see if security has no password again while you are still fresh with the password.  If there is no password, that is good.  Now boot with ubuntu and see if that helps.\nMake sure the boot order is correct too.\nYou might see a file before or after you set the uefi settings as something like \"0yes\" or \"1yes\".  This is the grub thing to put at the top of the boot order list.\nFile a bug on Ubuntu for not being user friendly for newer computers.\nOn the other hand, you have win7 which means that you have an old computer.  In that case, boot live and install boot-repair.  Google how to do it.  Either of these two suggestions should help.  Do boot-repair last.\n", "Q: how to change the lightdm gtk session icon Quick question - I'm using lightdm-gtk-greeter in both 15.10 and 16.04\nIn the panel the budgie-desktop session icon is appearing as a spanner (wrench) icon.\nAny ideas how I can change this from this default?\n\n\nAccording to this Q&A for the unity-greeter icons are defined in /usr/share/unity-greeter\nNo such folder exists for the lightdm-gtk-greeter\n\nA: Lightdm-gtk-greeter uses a different icon set. This question on launchpad explains the naming theme for the icons. I'm using lubuntu 14.04 and the aforementioned icons are located in /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/places. \nIf you already have an icon (svg file) you want to use, move it to that location and name it sessionname_badge-symbolic.svg where sessionname is the name of your session (the session name is found in /usr/share/xsessions), budgie in your case. Make sure to update the icon cache afterwards or the greeter still won't use it. \nsudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor\n\nThat should be it. \nIf that doesn't work, your icons may be in a different location, or there may not be a conf file for the particular session in /etc/lightdm. See the /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter-ubuntu.conf file and LightDM - Ubuntu Wiki for more details on writing up a .conf file.

However, I'm experiencing an issue with the VNC server, x11vnc 0.9.13. Currently, I have the following command execute on start up:\nx11vnc -shared -forever -bg -auth guess\nThe -auth guess part uses x11vnc -findauth to automatically find the correct XAUTHORITY file, which on my system appears to be /var/run/lightdm/root/:0.\nHere is the issue I am experiencing: the VNC setup works as expected until the lock screen appears (either when I manually lock the desktop, or an inactivity timeout occurs). When the lock screen appears, the VNC server displays the contents of the desktop just before the timeout occurs, a sort of still-frame or snapshot, and all input from my VNC client is ignored. I am unable to unlock it and return to my desktop from within the VNC client; I must use the remote system's keyboard and monitor. After it has been unlocked non-remotely, the VNC works as expected, until the screen lock appears again.\nA few things I should mention:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am able to select my user account and login from the account login screen without any issues over VNC, but when the desktop is locked, the issue occurs and I cannot unlock it.\n\n*The command sudo x11vnc -findauth returns XAUTHORITY=/var/run/lightdm/root/:0 only while I'm on the initial login screen after I first boot up. After I login, the same command returns XAUTHORITY=, whether I'm on my desktop or the screen is locked.\n\n\nA: light-locker switches to :1 when locking, so that explains why the vnc server running on :0 only sees a black screen.\nThe workaround is simply to start another vnc server at :1, connect to it, enter password, and go back to the original vnc connection at :0\nx11vnc -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/\\:1 -display :1\n\n\nA: Looks like theres a bug from 2014 which covers this:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/light-locker/+bug/1287171\nI ended up removing light-locker and installing xscreensaver, and now I no longer have any vnc issues.\n\nA: The only thing which worked in my case is to (install and) use xscreensaver instead of xfce's Lock Screen option.

Lazy Person Tip:  After entering sudo chmod 777 in the terminal, Open Nautilus, find your music files and drag them into the terminal.  Terminal will automatically display the  /path/to/your/files/for/you/ for you.\n\n*Press Enter\n\n*Close Terminal.\n\n*Open Rhythmbox; your files should be visible/able to be played.\n5a.  Alternately, open Nautilus, right click your file, select \"open with Rhythmbox\"; your .mp3 file should now be playing with Rhythmbox.\nThis worked for me, I hoped it helped.  Good luck, and happy breakdancing!\n\nA: Because the ethos of Linux is that all software should be free in terms of Liberty and usually but not necessarily cost.  There is some software that does not get installed by default.\nOne example is mp3 which is a propriety format and someone has had to pay a licence fee and sign an NDA (Non Disclosure Agreement) in order get access to to details so that mp3 files can be decoded.  Because of this it is not possible to make this software open source.\nIn earlier versions of Ubuntu this made things awkward as you had find and install these your self. However, in more recent versions you are now asked if you want these propriety, non open source, programs installed when you install.  If you didn't say yes during installation you can find them in the software centre under restricted-extras.\n\nA: I tried the stated solutions but nothing worked. What worked was when I went into the virtual box settings under Audio and started going between the different settings.\n\nOnce I did this, and probably in combination of the other stated solutions in which you do in Ubuntu itself, I was finally able to listen to and play my MP3 files.\n\nA: To play mp3 files with Rhythmbox you need the gstreamer 'ugly' plugins. There are 3 good choices to getting these installed and running with Rhythmbox;\n1.

I have recently disabled sudo's authentication caching ability so that it now prompts me for a password every time.\nAnd though this is good for security, it has caused one slight problem which I haven't been able to figure out a solution for, I am unable to run commands which go along the lines of: \nsudo <command> &\n\nIn the past I would have run a sudo command before that, it would have cached my password and allowed me to run sudo commands without prompt for the next few minutes, and thus it would allow me to run the command. \nBut when I run it now as there is no caching before hand and as it starts a new thread immediately and sudo doesn't even prompt me for a password, I am unable to run it in this way.\nSo unless I run sudo -i before it I am unable to run a command in this format which is becoming rather annoying.\nSo I was wondering if there is any way to get around this and still run programs and commands in this way?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, and specifically the program I want to run in this fashion is etherape if that makes any difference, but I would really like the solution to work for all programs and commands.\n\nA: You can't. The & sends the command to the background immediately. That is, a subshell is created in the background and the command is executed there. When that command issues a prompt, as is the case of sudo, the prompt is displayed in the background and you never see it. \nThe only way around that is to bring the command back to the foreground, provide the password and send it back to the background. For example:\n$ sudo command &\n$ fg\nsudo command\n[sudo] password for terdon: \n\nNow, enter your password, hit Enter and then hit CtrlZ to send it back to the background and bg to tell it to continue running. \nA simpler approach would be to never use & and, instead, send jobs to the background manually with CtrlZ and bg after launching them.\nFinally, you might want to consider setting sudo's password timeout to something like 1 or 2 seconds. That would still give you enough security (unless you're trying to guard against the Flash) and allow you to run commands like that as expected. \n\nA: Instead of running sudo in the background, tell sudo to run the command in the background. From man sudo:\n-b, --background\n     Run the given command in the background.  Note that it is not\n     possible to use shell job control to manipulate background\n     processes started by sudo.  Most interactive commands will\n     fail to work properly in background mode.\n\nFor example:\nsudo -b sleep 10\n\nAnother way would be to just use a shell to run the command:\nsudo sh -c 'sleep 10 &'\n\nAnother option would to specify a graphical program for obtaining the password, and send sudo to the background anyway:\n-A, --askpass\n     Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will read it from\n     the user's terminal.  If the -A (askpass) option is\n     specified, a (possibly graphical) helper program is executed\n     to read the user's password and output the password to the\n     standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable is\n     set, it specifies the path to the helper program.  Otherwise,\n     if sudo.conf(5) contains a line specifying the askpass\n     program, that value will be used.  For example:\n\n         # Path to askpass helper program\n         Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass\n\n     If no askpass program is available, sudo will exit with an\n     error.\n\nAskpass programs are typically used for SSH. One such is provided by the ssh-askpass-gnome package, which is installed by default, at least on Ubuntu 15.10.\nSUDO_ASKPASS=/usr/bin/ssh-askpass sudo -A sleep 10 &\n\n\nA: If you're willing to set timestamp_timeout to at least something like 0.02 (1.2 seconds, I'd say just as safe as 0) in /etc/sudoers (needed in your case, but with the default settings or with timestamp_timeout set to anything but 0 one may just do the following), you could set an alias like this one in ~/.bashrc, which won't require you to remember to do something before running the command and which will allow you to keep the control of the process.:\nalias sudo='sudo -v; [ $? ] && sudo'\n\nThe trick here is the semicolon, which will make Bash parse sudo -v first and separately, authenticating the user, and limit the potential backgrounding part to the [ $? ] && sudo command, which will check if sudo -v was succesful and run sudo again (potentially backgrounding it) in case it was.\n$ alias sudo='sudo -v; [ $? ] && sudo'\n$ sudo -H gedit &\n[sudo] password for user:\n[1] 19966\n$ jobs\n[1]+  Running                 [ $? ] && sudo -H gedit &\n\n", "Q: Do malicious web sites ever exploit vulnerabilities in Linux clients? Do malicious web sites ever exploit vulnerabilities in Linux clients?\nAre there any documented instances of this happening in the wild?\nI am talking about actually taking over the client's machine rather than cross-site scripting.\nAlso, I'm not asking whether it's possible in theory (of course it is, otherwise they wouldn't be vulnerabilities), but if anyone actually bothers to go after Linux users.\n\nA: After adding my comment, I was very intrigued, and decided to do some research. Now all of this talk of malicious websites is a big \"if.\" What I mean by this is that there are many factors that go into any malicious website. These include but are not limited to the following:\n1) Ubuntu (Linux) Compatible - As unfortunate as it is, most PC users these days are running one version or another of Microsoft Windows, and because of that, most malicious programs in general are made to affect and attack the Windows operating system. As you can see here however, there are still people out there developing attacks against Linux users. Back to the point, because of this, over 95% of malicious websites that are made will not affect you! (You being an Ubuntu/Linux user)\n2) User \"stupidity\" - First off, the user will have to either mis-click a link, visit an \"unsafe page\", or click on an advertisement of some sort to get to one of these pages. Once there, the website cannot do much on its own. On some level, the user will have to be prompted to either \nA - Download a file or \nB - (If the website is coded well enough to slip it into the background) The user will be prompted if any changes are attempted at changing the system.\n\nSo do your best not to visit said sites, and if you do, get some browser protection.\n3) Intensity And Actual Function of Malicious Software - This is probably the one you will have to worry most about. Because Linux is a more in depth operating system, the system tends to be spread out more, which may make it hard to track down exactly where this Malicious Program infested (if at all). However, this is also a good thing. For example, in the link above, the program manifests as A Mozilla process. I Personally use Chrome, and have uninstalled Mozilla, so if I even so much as see a glimpse of the logo, I will start to worry. This can also make it easier to track and destroy the infest.\n4) Protection On Computer - This one although looked past very often is probably the most important. If any of you reading this remember the crisis with MACs and their \"great protection,\" skip ahead. If not, when the Mac-book laptop was first introduced, and the Apple Operating System was first being born, viral infestations were in their early stages, as little baby computer-bugs. When Apple announced that their laptops and computers would have (to paraphrase) \"Next-To Perfect Antivirus,\" people were ecstatic. Because of this pre-installed anti-viral defense, the everyday user refrained from using any type of other software to protect their computer. As a result, once the Apple anti-viral software was cracked, millions of dollars of damage could be dealt from a remote source. Although that story may seem off topic from the question, it is exactly why Ubuntu and Linux in general in starting to get targeted by hackers. Because Ubuntu is famous for being safe and secure, people don't bother to get any antivirus software, leaving them open to attacks. So please, PLEASE, get some damn antivirus.\n5) Elongated Periods of Time - Although Trojan viruses, and some minor bugs can manifest within a matter of minutes, some viruses may take hours, or even days to grow to their full size and take over your computer (sometimes literally.) To prevent this, you can schedule scans to happen on your computer. Depending on how time you spend browsing the web, you can adjust this accordingly. I personally have mine set to run every hour, and the best part is that I don't have to do anything! Just make sure to always play it safe. If you think you may contracted a virus, just do a scan immediately, and hey, you can always come to AskUbuntu for help solving it!\nAs to more thoroughly answer the question of \"WIll people bother to go after Linux users?\", yes. Unfortunately, every operating system is vulnerable to attack, and with a recent (past 1-2 years) surge of people using Linux, there have been more attacks on said people. Although many people do experience viruses on a daily basis, the \"documented cases\" that you are asking for do not really exist. If you were to see the official list, you would see that most viruses have been dealt with by now, but remember, more are made/updated every day.\n", "Q: Dns problem ubuntu server I recently downloaded the ubuntu server 14.04 and I wanted to use the webmin, there's no error in installation and every thing sounds good.\nI tried to put in browser https://name_server:10000 but nothing is showing.

Change the ext3 designation to ext4 in /etc/fstab.\n\nA: I saw this bright red message in my dmesg output and got curious although I am not experiencing any problems. I checked the hint from psusi's answer but /etc/fstab is set to ext4 on my system. After some more research I found this post in the arch forum with an explanation that sounds resonable to me. The gist: The ext-fs driver supports multiple versions and checks which one works if none is specified at boot time. My kernel command line reads root=/dev/xvda ro console=xvc0 console=hvc0 so it looks like auto-detection is required.\n\nA: This just happened to me recently after a package upgrade leaving me with a low resolution login screen that wouldn't work.

Make sure to back up your important data.\nThe cause may be due to apps that only work w/ 14.04, or it may be because you didn't update to 14.10 first and because of that some things were not added in the process of upgrading since some important files were not in the system. The upgrader probably assumed you had those files.

I have been looking into Pinta but have not found this feature yet.

There may be a way to disable them; not sure.\nI'd suggest physically removing the card.\nNote that people will still be able to insert USB WiFi cards, whether you remove the drivers or the internal card.\n\nA: *\n\n*Check you wireless device with lspci -nn\n\n*To prevent the driver from loading use: 'echo \"blacklist xxx\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf', where xxx is your driver name. It will blacklist your driver\n\n*If you later want to re enable it: 'sudo sed -i '/^xxx/ d' /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf', it will remove the blacklisting. \nPlease don't use the beginning and ending '' when using these commands.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Why does mariadb keep dying?

I know it timed out. The second systemd, after the mysqld lines is a bit mystifying, because it does in fact start. An application (OwnCloud, specifically) that depends on the database works normally... for the minute-and-change that MariaDB is up.\nAnother question suggested using time /etc/init.d/mysql start to determine how long it was taking. I ran it repeatedly to confirm the time - it's a few seconds on either side of 90s each time.\nOther research lead me to check file permissions, which are fine... besides, it does start up, temporarily. I've poked and prodded to the best of my (admittedly limited when it comes to Linux) ability, and I haven't made any headway.\nSo, the question is... How do I get the MariaDB service to stay up?\nAs an extra wrinkle, after writing this question, I left the machine up and running. I came back to it a week later (I didn't touch it between). Using the exact same command, sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start, was successful. The mysql daemon started and ran; it came back with a an [ ok ] report.

But, I am still very new to Linux and would like all the help I can get, Thanks!\n\nA: I guess you missed the file path, there should be /home/username/Downloads not /Home, please recheck your path with ls -a.\n\nA: Most likely, the correct path to the file is ~/Downloads/kali.img but you shouldn't run this command as root you should be using sudo.\nClick here for more information on sudo if you are not familiar with this command.\nRunning the command as root will change the path of ~/ from /home/$USER to / which is why the error lists the path as /Home/Downloads instead of /home/$USER/Home/Downloads as it would if you had used sudo.\nNow, exit out of root and log in as a non root user that has sudo permission. \nThen, run the following command to locate the correct path to the file and then change your dd command to reflect the correct path.\nfind ~/ -name '*kali*img' 2>&1 | egrep '*kali*'\n\n\nThe correct command should look like this (again, you should not be logged in as root!):\nsudo dd bs=4M if=\"/home/kushkiddo/Downloads/kali.img\" of=/dev/sdb\n\nor\nsudo dd if=\"/home/kushkiddo/Downloads/kali.img\" of=/dev/sdb bs=4M \n\n\nTo explain:\nThe commands listed on the kali linux website are those listed for a kali user and kali users are normally logged in as root.\nFor Ubuntu, it is assumed that the user will use the sudo command instead of logging in as root to perform functions that require root permission. \nOn Ubuntu, the root account is deleted and so the path of ~/ is the top level directory / instead of a user or root user directory such as /home/$USER/ or /root like it would be if you were logged in as a regular user on Ubuntu or as root when using kali respectively.\n\nA: ~ is a shortcut to the current user's home folder. You can verify this by typing:\necho ~\n\nTypically a users's home folder will be at /home/THEIRUSERNAME, but for root it is /root.\nI'm guessing kali.img is saved at /home/YOURUSERNAME/Downloads/Kali.img, but presently you're telling DD it's at /root/Home/Downloads/Kali.img.\nIf kali.img is in your user's download folder, then the correct command would be:\ndd if=/home/YOURUSERNAME/Downloads/kali.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4M\n\nSubstitute YOURUSERNAME for your username obviously.\nPlease, always verify paths before running a DD command, because if you accidentally overwrite something, you will not be able to recover it. It's the equivalent of zeroing it.\n\nA: The following command sudo dd bs=4M if=\"/home/YOURUSERNAME/Downloads/\" of=/dev/sdb is the answer. \nThe /dev/sdb is the place you are writing it to,\nIf you are struggling to find where the image is I found out that using this command sudo find / -name '*FILE*img' 2>&1 | egrep '*FILENAME*\nI would like to thank mchid for your very detailed descriptions about each command, and what it does.\nThank you!\n\nA: Ok, decaptialize Home and drop the ~ to make the path /home/Downloads/kali.img.\nDirectory names are case sensitive and ~ expands to the home directory of the current user (in root's case: /root).\n\nA: dd is a powerful but dangerous tool. It does what you tell it to do without questions, so it is easy to write to the wrong device and overwrite valuable data, for example the family pictures.\nI suggest that you install mkusb, which wraps a safety belt around dd. mkusb can clone image files (and also image files compressed with gzip and xz) to a target drive (typically a USB pendrive or a memory card).\nSee the following links,\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb#Expansion_and_imaging_from_a_compressed_image_file\nWin32 Disk Imager is a corresponding tool in Windows.

Is it possible to do the same thing using a GUI?\nBefore people comment that the Terminal command works just fine (which it indeed does), I want to say that I am introducing a friend to Ubuntu. He's in his 70's and very unsavvy. People like him usually get scared by any mention of the terminal. I like reccomending Ubuntu to people who know very little about computers, and such people don't like to use the terminal. I don't like telling them that in order to do this or that they have to open the terminal and put together this and that command. They are used to simpler things.\n\nA: First of all you need to install exfat support packages. You can do it by running in terminal\nsudo apt-get install exfat-utils exfat-fuse\n\nThen you will be able to use gnome-disks to format exfat. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Disks\" application in Dash.\n\n*Select your disk drive.\n\n\n\n*Press the \"gears\" button and select \"Format\".\n\n*Select \"Custom\" as \"Type\" and type in \"exfat\" as a filesystem.\n\n\n\n*Press \"Format\".\n\n\nA: Kde Partition Manager is another alternative to gnome-disks (which I don't have a good experience with when it comes to formatting).\nIt's Like GParted but (still) have support for exFAT.\nI just made a more detailed post about it here.\n\n\nNote\nIf you're introducing this to a new user, make sure to tell them to use the correct (USB) disk on the right.\n", "Q: How to simplify the command : four same structures? ntpdate 110.75.186.247 >> /var/log/ntpdate.log ||  ntpdate 110.75.186.247 >> /var/log/ntpdate.log || ntpdate 203.123.48.218 >> /var/log/ntpdate.log|| ntpdate 103.16.199.21  >> /var/log/ntpdate.log\n\nI have tried two method,none of them succeed.\nntpdate 110.75.186.247  ||  ntpdate 110.75.186.247  || ntpdate 203.123.48.218 || ntpdate 103.16.199.21  >> /var/log/ntpdate.log\nntpdate 110.75.186.247  ||  ntpdate 110.75.186.247  || ntpdate 203.123.48.218 || ntpdate 103.16.199.21  &&>> /var/log/ntpdate.log\n\nHow to simplify the command?\n\nA: Use a simple for construct:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor ip in 110.75.186.247 110.75.186.247 203.123.48.218 103.16.199.21; do\n    out=\"$(ntpdate \"$ip\" 2>/dev/null)\" && echo \"$out\" >>/var/log/ntpdate.log && break\ndone\n\nOr saving IP addresses in an array:\n#!/bin/bash\nips=( 110.75.186.247 110.75.186.247 203.123.48.218 103.16.199.21 )\nfor ip in \"${ips[@]}\"; do\n    out=\"$(ntpdate \"$ip\" 2>/dev/null)\" && echo \"$out\" >>/var/log/ntpdate.log && break\ndone\n\n\nEven simpler, get rid of the intermediate variable (thanks @kos):\n#!/bin/bash\nips=( 110.75.186.247 110.75.186.247 203.123.48.218 103.16.199.21 )\nfor ip in \"${ips[@]}\"; do\n    ntpdate \"$ip\" 2>/dev/null >>/var/log/ntpdate.log && break\ndone\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Check if the file .bash_aliases exists in your home directory with ls -a ~/.bash_aliases\n(if not run the text editor of your choice, which is in my case nano ~/.bash_aliases)\n\n*Add the following line into that file:\nalias update-time='ntpdate 110.75.186.247 >> /var/log/ntpdate.log || ntpdate 110.75.186.247 >> /var/log/ntpdate.log || ntpdate 203.123.48.218 >> /var/log/ntpdate.log || ntpdate 103.16.199.21  >> /var/log/ntpdate.log'\n\n*Save and exit the editor\n\n*Now you simply can run the command update-time and rest is magic :)\n\nA: The problem with the construction\nntpdate 192.0.2.1 || ntpdate 203.0.113.2 >> /var/log/ntpdate.log\n\nis that >> only applies to the last command. You can address that by using a parenthesis around the commands like this:\n( ntpdate 192.0.2.1 || ntpdate 203.0.113.2 ) >> /var/log/ntpdate.log\n\nYou may think that typing ntpdate multiple times is redundant, and it should be possible to eliminate that. You can eliminate the repetition of ntpdate by using a loop. Though in your specific case the command is so simple, that the use of a loop introduce more complexity than it eliminates:\nfor IP in 192.0.2.1 203.0.113.2\ndo\n    ntpdate \"$IP\" && break\ndone >> /var/log/ntpdate.log\n\nAlternatively it may be that your original problem is better solved by invoking ntpdate only once with multiple server addresses:\nntpdate 192.0.2.1 203.0.113.2 >> /var/log/ntpdate.log\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 ATI Radeon HD 5450 Graphics Support In 16.04 LTS support for AMD proprietary drivers has been dropped. Instead there's an open source AMDGPU driver.\nMy Question: Will the ATI Radeon HD 5450 work with the open source AMDGPU driver?\n\nA: According to the official release notes of Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus), the open source ADMGPU driver should support most AMD graphics cards, so I can safely say yes, your graphics card should be supported.\nHowever, I do recommend that when the official release of Ubuntu 16.04 comes (April 21), be sure to install using a live disc or a bootable disk to try out Ubuntu 16.04 and see how it performs on that particular machine, before doing a full installation.\n", "Q: backuppc has missing menu items after installation Problem: backuppc is missing essential menu items in its web interface.\nItems \"Edit Hosts\", \"Edit Config\" etc are missing.\nbackuppc is installed on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS.\nI have even completely removed the backuppc application (using dpkg --purge backupppc), and re-installed it (apt-get install backuppc). Menu items are still missing.\n\nWhen running /usr/lib/backuppc/cgi-bin/index.cgi directly in the CLI, I do get the missing menu items. The HTML output from index.cgi includes:\n<a href=\"?action=editConfig\">Edit Config</a>\n<a href=\"?action=editConfig&amp;newMenu=hosts\">Edit Hosts</a>\n\nI tried running de index.cgi on command line as root, backuppc and www-data, all having the same output. (I had to enable a login shell for www-data)\nHowever, that is missing when accessing the backuppc admin from the console in the browser.\nThe file /etc/backuppc/config.pl contains:\n$Conf{CgiAdminUserGroup} = 'backuppc';\n$Conf{CgiAdminUsers}     = 'backuppc';\n\nWhen I change $Conf{CgiAdminUsers} to '*' instead of 'backuppc', it works, but I prefer not to give admin access to all users, so this can only serve as a temporarily workaround.\napache configuration is default by installing backuppc package:\n<Directory /usr/share/backuppc/cgi-bin/>\n        AllowOverride None\n        Allow from all\n\n        Options ExecCGI FollowSymlinks\n        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi\n        DirectoryIndex index.cgi\n\n        AuthUserFile /etc/backuppc/htpasswd\n        AuthType basic\n        AuthName \"BackupPC admin\"\n        require valid-user\n</Directory>\n\nThe contents above are in /etc/backuppc/apache.conf which is symbolically linked from /etc/apache2/conf.d/backuppc.conf.\nFor problem analysis, I have added the following script to /usr/lib/backuppc/cgi-bin/debug.cgi:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nprintf(\"My userid is $> (%s)\\n\", (getpwuid($>))[0]);\n\nThe output, written in the apache error.log, after authentication, was:\nMy userid is 33 (www-data)\n\nSo the userid is incorrectly passed to BackupPc. The user id passed is www-data where I expected that the authenticated user id, passed to BackupPc would be backuppc as the latter is the one I used to login with. So probably, this is an apache configuration issue. \nI have added a second cgi script printenv.cgi which output the environment variables. The script contains:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nprint \"Content-type: text/plain\\n\\n\";\nforeach $var (sort(keys(%ENV))) {\n    $val = $ENV{$var};\n    $val =~ s|\\n|\\\\n|g;\n    $val =~ s|\"|\\\\\"|g;\n    print \"${var}=\\\"${val}\\\"\\n\";\n}\n\nThe output contained:\nREMOTE_USER=\"$REDIRECT_REMOTE_USER=\"\n\nwhere backuppc requires that this environment variable REMOTE_USER contains the authenticated user (backuppc in my example). Turns out that an incorrect REMOTE_USER is the cause of the problem. \nThe diagnostic scripts were placed in /usr/lib/backuppc/cgi-bin/ and were symbolically linked from /usr/share/backuppc/cgi-bin/. Their ownership was backupc:www-data and they were granted chmod a+x and u+s permissions.\n\nA: With the output of REMOTE_USER=\"$REDIRECT_REMOTE_USER=\", I did a grep on REMOTE_USER in the configuration scripts below /etc/apache2/conf-enabled. I found a .conf file that contained:\nSetEnv REMOTE_USER=$REDIRECT_REMOTE_USER\n\nThe .conf script was unrelated to backuppc.\nPrefixing the REMOTE_USER line with #, and then restarting the services\n# apachtectl restart\n# service backuppc restart\n\nresolved the issue.\n", "Q: Can I download ubuntu 64bit on my windows 7 32bit?

I have a dual-boot 15.10 installation with WIN10 on an M2 disk.  I am keen to work with 15.10 since I had Wifi driver problems I could not resolve easily in 14.04.4.  I can boot into the installed 15.10 or Try Ubuntu 15.10 on USB no problems. About 10 seconds after loading the desktop (ie after the purple startup screen), everything freezes, nothing works (keyboard, mouse, touchpad), but the display is unchanged.

When the Unity desktop had loaded, and before it froze, I pressed Ctrl + Alt + F1. The nvidia-355 driver would not install, neither did the 361.28 driver that the nvidia website suggested was appropriate for the GTX970 graphics card on Linux-64.  \nI ran the command sudo ubuntu-drivers devices and noticed that the installed driver was 352. I then ran sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall.  I repeated sudo ubuntu-drivers devices and noted that the installed driver was still 352.  Then I rebooted, and was treated to a fully functioning Unity desktop.  So far no freezes or other issues.  \nI assume that the autoinstall fixed something, somewhere.

I did not have a Flash pen drive at the time so I used my external hard drive to boot and install Ubuntu. The external HD contained more than 300GB of files in one folder plus the Ubuntu ISO file. During installation, I chose to delete all Windows related files in the laptop and replace it with Ubuntu (it was an option in the Ubuntu installation), thinking that when I restart the laptop after installation, Ubuntu would have replaced Windows in drive C. \nUnfortunately, Ubuntu was installed in the laptop but it did not replace the Windows (so I can both boot in Windows in Ubuntu). Worse, all files in the external HD were deleted, and were replaced by files in drive C of my old Windows laptop.\nMy goal is to recover all the lost files in the External HD. My plan is to use Recuva. But to complicate things, I cannot access my external hard drive using a Windows laptop. Although it is recognized as a \"device\", it does not appear as an as an option in \"This PC\". Note that this external HD is accessible through a Ubuntu laptop.\nSo my question are:\n1) How can I make the external HD accessible using a laptop with Windows OS? \n2) With the \"background story\" in mind, what steps can I do to recover the files, if you think Recuva is not enough?\nBefore writing this, I have read some of the related questions and I would like to say that I am grateful for the help this community offers to end-users like me. \n\nA: Windows will not be able to read Ubuntu (ext4) formatted drives. I have no experience with Recuva, and whether it can recover from ext4 formatted drives.\nWhat I know however is that you will be able to recover those files, or directories that were not yet overwritten using Open Source Linux tools such as TestDisk. This tool can be installed in an Ubuntu live session (i.e. by booting from an Ubuntu installation USB choosing \"try out Ubuntu\").\nTo do so you need the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*a working Internet connection on the live Ubuntu (prefer LAN over wireless).\n\n*an Ubuntu USB drive from where you can boot.\n\n*a spare drive to store the rescued files on.\n\n\nIn case TestDisk fails to recover all files we may also give PhotoRec a chance.\n", "Q: Ubuntu USB Instalation problem I have a problem installing Ubuntu using a USB drive with Windows already installed.

After that it asks to restart the computer to install Ubuntu alongside Windows. \nSo, the computer restarts and the Ubuntu screen asks to remove installation media and press enter. I do so, but it does not install Ubuntu it just boots up Windows 7.\nAnd inside Windows it does not prompt up a installation screen or nothing. I do not really know what i am doing wrong. \nThanks for the help and sorry if this was already asked. \n\nA: Better use Ubuntu 15.10. \nI guess your Problem is that you choose the wrong place for installing the bootloader.\nProbably /dev/sda is the right one.

How does one do that? Is there not any way of saving one's backups up to a directory other than the default one? Such as, for example, an external drive?\n\nA: UPDATED ANSWER:\nThe hard drive you want to use as a backup device must have one of the following filesystems:\n\n\n*\n\n*ext2/3/4\n\n*reiserfs\n\n*reiser4\n\n*xfs\n\n*jfs\n\n*btrfs\n\n*luks\n\n\nIf that's the case, it will show up in the backup devices list in the GUI of timeshift and/or it's possible to add it via --backup-device on the cmdline.\nOLD ANSWER:\nYou need your filesystem to be compatible to the backed up system. So let's say you have an ext2/3/4 formatted Ubuntu filesystem. You need to format the backup filesystem (e.g. your external HD) to ext2/3/4.\nI am not sure which are all the working combinations in the end, but this will definitely do always:\nUbuntu (extX) -> External Drive (extX) - Where X is {2,3,4}\nAfter you formatted your external drive with the correct filesystem (e.g. with exactly the same filesystem as your Ubuntu partition), the new backup drive will show up as one of the options in the GUI of timeshift.\nEDIT (Background information):\nThe true answer lies in these lines (Main.vala):\npublic Device? get_device_from_name(Gee.ArrayList<Device> device_list, string device_name){\n    foreach(Device pi in device_list) {\n        if (!pi.has_linux_filesystem()) { continue; }\n....\n\nHere you can see a function from Timeshift sources. -> While iterating through the possible devices, those that have not a Linux filesystem will be excluded from possible backup devices.\nAnother source file provides us with what is defined as Linux_filesystem in Timeshift (Utility.vala:633ff):\npublic bool has_linux_filesystem(){\n        switch(type){\n            case \"ext2\":\n            case \"ext3\":\n            case \"ext4\":\n            case \"reiserfs\":\n            case \"reiser4\":\n            case \"xfs\":\n            case \"jfs\":\n            case \"btrfs\":\n            case \"luks\":\n                return true;\n            default:\n                return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n\nA: I was able to set it up using a disk image on an the network share, then format that image as ext4, then mount it, which gives us a blkid! \nBelow are the details of how I did it:\n#for a 15 gb drive (15Megabytes x 1024 = 15GB)\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/path/to/network/share/timeshift.img bs=15M count=1024\n\n#format the partition as ext4\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /mnt/path/to/network/share/timeshift.img\n\n#create a mount point for your new drive\nsudo mkdir /mnt/timeshift_parition_mount_point -p\n\nNext set up a systemd mount file in /etc/systemd/system/\n[Unit]\nDescription=Timeshift partition mount service\nAfter=remote-fs.target\n\n[Mount]\nWhat=/mnt/path/to/network/share/timeshift.img\nWhere=/mnt/timeshift_parition_mount_point\nType=ext4\nOptions=defaults,loop,_netdev,auto\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nNote: it must be named \"mnt-timeshift_parition_mount_point.mount\" to match your mount point (any /'s get converted to -'s)\n#Next enable it, so it gets mounted at boot:\nsudo systemctl enable mnt-timeshift_parition_mount_point.mount\n\nsudo systemctl start mnt-timeshift_parition_mount_point.mount\n\n#get the blkid of your new partition you created\nblkid | grep loop\n\nsudo vi /etc/timeshift.json\n#and edit the \"backup_device_uuid\" to match the blkid of your newly mounted partition \n\nNote: if you need to copy your timeshift backups from the old location, I find this works best:\nsudo cp /old/timshift/directory/timeshift /mnt/timeshift_parition_mount_point/ --preserve=links -R\n\n", "Q: Clone Ubuntu system to a pendrive and make it bootable? I have Ubuntu 14.04 installed on my laptop. Can I clone the entire system with apps, settings, etc on a USB 3 pendrive, and then boot from that on other computers as a portable Ubuntu installation to take around with me?\nI am trying a function that Timeshift has that's called \"Clone the current system on another device\". I've selected the pendrive as the target device. Timeshift was talking about this being bootable. But is it going to bootable on only this laptop, or on any system? For example, on an Intel Mac, or a Windows computer without the grub bootloader? Is that Timeshift function what I am looking for, or do I have to do something else?\nEdit: The Timeshift clone failed to boot on the first system I tested it on. (A Dell Hackintosh that usually boots from USB just fine.) \n\nA: When you install Ubuntu, you are installing it for that system. If you take that installation and boot it on another machine, it's the equivalent of making hardware changes. Ubuntu will in most cases still boot, but you may need to install drivers specific to the new system, you may need manually reconfigure some things for the new system (eg: sounds, graphics, network interfaces), or it may work flawlessly. It all depends on the hardware. This is not a good approach, unless you are using machines with identical hardware.\nAlternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are tools available for making live-DVDs from installations. I used to use Remastersys (outdated, not sure what active alternatives are available), and it worked great.\n\n*Build a customized Ubuntu ISO. This can be accomplished by extracting the squashfs, chrooting it, making desired changes, repacking, and swapping for the original squashfs in the ISO.\n\n*Setup a live-flashdrive with a persistence file/partition. Some live-flashdrive creators will even do this for you (eg: Unetbootin)!\n\n*Use a different distro like Puppy Linux, Porteus, TinyCore Linux, or Slax that is actually meant to be run as a portable OS used with multiple computers.\n\nA: Yes you can copy a full Ubuntu OS (with Programs, customizations and all ) from your Desktop or Laptop Hard drive to an external USB Flash Drive or external Hard drive. I just did it for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to an external Hard drive (but equally applicable to USB Flash drive as well) \nRequired software / hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Destination External Hard Drive / Destination USB Flash Drive to have the cloned OS\n\n*Source OS (Ubuntu or any other OS that needs to be cloned)\n\n*USB Drive (with at least with as much capacity (256 MB - 1 GB) as a clonezilla live USB requires)\n\n*computer / laptop having Windows which can run Live Linux USB creator\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Clonezilla from http://clonezilla.org/downloads/download.php?branch=stable (download the ISO)\n\n*Download Live Linux USB Creator (Lili) from http://www.linuxliveusb.com/en/download\n\n*Create a bootable Clonezilla (Live Clonezilla) on USB by running Live Linux USB Creator.\n\n*Configure your Source desktop / laptop to boot from a USB drive\n\n*Insert both, the destination external hard drive or destination USB Flash drive in 1 USB Slot and the Clonezilla Live USB drive in other slot and boot.\n\n*Clonezilla will take some time to read partition info When the Clonezilla UI appears, select default menu entries.\n\n*[With Caution] select Source Partition info and Destination partition info It may be noted that Clonezilla would require space on destination USB Flash drive or external hard disk which is equivalent of the source Hard disk and it will erase all data from the destination USB Flash drive / external hard drive.\n\n*Once all is selected, Clonezilla will create a live OS on the destination drive / flash drive\nTest the cloned OS by removing Clonezilla Live USB drive and booting from the Live OS which has been cloned onto the destination External drive / USB Flash drive.\nEnjoy !\n\nA: The refork of Remastersys is Systemback.  It does exactly what you want -- though you need to do a \"two step\" (i.e., Step 1: backup live system to USB using Systemback; then Step 2: boot to backup USB and install on a second USB) to create a truly persistent, live copy of your current operating system.\nAlthough (sadly) Kendek has stopped developing Systemback, it is in my opinion one of the best Linux applications ever.  \n\nA: In addition to Systemback, I just found that rsync can be used to create a bootable USB.  All you need to do is rsync the live system (it can be from the current booted live system) to the mounted USB drive.  You then must make sure that /etc/fstab/ and your boot loader (e.g., rEFInd or GRUB2) have the correct UUID for the USB drive.  I was so thrilled to discover this, I thought it should be shared.\n", "Q: How to play video using FFmpeg on Ubuntu?

Therefore the script checks time/edits the displayed time only once per minute, sleeping the rest of the time.\n\nEdit\nAs per today (2016-4-9), a ppa of a polished version is available. To install from ppa:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:vlijm/abouttime\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install abouttime\n\nThe day periods in this version are changed, compared to the script version above, now it is:\nmorning 6:00-12:00\nafternoon 12:00-18:00\nevening 18:00-24:00\nnight 24:00-6:00\n\n... and the indicator has tho option to change the icon during daytime:\nmorning/afternoon/evening/night:    \nAs mentioned, this version was tested on both Mate (from the original question) Unity and Xubuntu.\n\n\nA: If you have Kubuntu (Plasma Desktop Ubuntu distro), you have a built-in widget called \"fuzzy clock\" -- it's been around at least since 14.04, or as long ago as Plasma 4 has been out, and it's still in Plasma 5 as found in Kubuntu 16.04.\nFuzzy Clock can be set to be as \"accurate\" as five minute increments, like reading an analog clock (say, \"ten after four\"), but it also has three \"fuzzier\" settings, one of which gives readings like \"afternoon\" and one that just gives \"Weekend!\" (on a Sunday afternoon -- I presume it'll say \"Monday\" tomorrow).\nI don't know if fuzzy clock is available in other Ubuntu flavors -- I saw it in xfce (as found in Xubuntu) on my system, but the OS was installed as Kubuntu, so I'm not sure if the fuzzy clock is native to xfce as well as KDE/Plasma, nor whether it's available in Unity or Mate.\n", "Q: How to prevent key repeat for my mute/unmute key? I have set a very low key repeat delay because I like it … makes me feel working faster :-)\nHowever, this creates problems with the hardware mute/unmute button on my computer (a Lenovo ThinkPad X201): when pressing it, often the key repeat will kick in and will both mute and unmute it again.\nCan I disable key repeat for a single key? If so, how for this button?\n\nA: You can disable key repeat for individual keys with the xset utility. It works on X.org level, independent of yourdesktop environment. For the mute/unmute key, you would do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the X event tester program xev in a terminal, make its window the active one and press the mute/unmute button to find out the keycode of your button. Look for a KeyPress or KeyRelease message containing XF86AudioMute in your terminal, like this one:\nKeyRelease event, serial 48, synthetic NO, window 0x4a00001,\n    root 0x98, subw 0x0, time 277961250, (-222,299), root:(879,323),\n    state 0x0, keycode 121 (keysym 0x1008ff12, XF86AudioMute), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nThis is from a ThinkPad X201 and shows that the keycode is 121.\n\n*Execute the following command to disable key repeat for the key with keycode 121 (or whatever you found if your hardware is different):\nxset -r 121\n\n\n*If this successfully disabled key repeat for the mute/unmute key, put this xset -r 121 command into your autostart to activate it on system start. Since it's X.org specific, it is ok to put it into your desktop environment's autostart configuration. No need to have it before X.org starts, and also not on the X.org login screen.\n\n", "Q: 15.10 No GRUB menu with windows 10 I am trying to get Ubuntu 15.10 dual booted with Windows 10. But the GRUB menu does not show up.\nThe PC came pre-installed with Windows 8.1 and I upgraded it to Windows 10. Following directions from here, these are the steps I took\n\n\n*\n\n*Confirmed that windows 10 was booted using UEFI (diskmgmt.msc reports one filesystem in Disk 0 as \"EFI System Partition\". diskpart.exe indicates a \"*\" under GPT column).\n\n*Downloaded the 64 bit installer and created a FAT-32 formatted live USB (using rufus)\n\n*There was no option to disable fast boot in my BIOS. Disabled fast boot in Windows (control panel -> power options -> turn off fast startup) and hibernate option as well\n\n*In BIOS settings, disabled legacy-support/BIOS boot and secure boot.\n\n*Booted with the live USB and was prompted to try or install ubuntu. I opted to try. BTB, since this menu was presented I understand the live USB was booted in UEFI mode and not BIOS mode.\n\n*Created ext4 (/dev/sda6) and swap (/dev/sda9) partitions using gparted (from live USB)\n\n*Started Ubuntu install and opted to install beside windows boot manager. Selected \"advanced partitioning tool\" for partition selection and selected sda6 for root (with formatting and ext4) and sda9 for swap. sda2 (windows' UEFI boot partition) was markd \"uefi\".\n\n*Completed install. Re-booted after removing live USB. The system booted directly into Windows 10.\n\n*So I re-booted back into the live USB and ran boot-repair with recommended fixes. This had no impact. As recommended by boot-repair, ran \"bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\" in windows successfully. Again no impact. root-repair report is here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/15525648/\nAppreciate any pointers on what could be going wrong. TIA.\nUpdate: If I boot with the live USB and press escape in the \"Try/Install\" menu, the \"crub >\" CLI is presented and typing \"exit\" here leads to the GRUB menu and I can select the installed Ubuntu and use it. But would hate to use the live USB everytime I need to boot into Ubuntu.\n\nA: Where is your /boot/efi partition? \nif you disabled legacy mode in BIOS and did not set a /boot/EFI partition in Ubuntu install partition manager you in fact installed lagacy boot. Try enabling legacy boot in BIOS and run boot repair again.\nEDIT: If you run legacy mode make sure this is enabled in bios and the order it boots is set to legacy first. You also have to make sure secureboot is off as it sometimes prevents you from altering the MBR. Install bootloader on /dev/sda <---\n\nA: What happened is that windows 10 hard locked your NTFS partition as it does with fake-shutdown/restart.\nIf your Ubuntu is freshly installed then you may as well run the installation again.\nIn windows hit Windows then cmd then Shift+Enter,  type: powercfg -h off, Enter\nThen reboot (to the ubuntu live install USB) and run the install process again.\nthis time here:\n\nSelect \"Something else\" or \"Erase Ubuntu 15.10 and Reinstall\". I prefer Something Else as it doesn't attempt to re-use GRUB.\nYou'll be prompted with this:\n\nDelete all ext and swap partitions, create an EFI one if there isn't one already if there is don't create and don't delete it.

So my question is: How can I put this informarion into an array? I mean I want an array with elements to look like this:\n c/123 /12 h/90 /0 txt/0\n\nwhere c, h and txt are file extension and 123, 12 and 0 are file sizes. So lately I can separately work with sizes and extensions\nI hope, I've neatly put my question down. Sorry for mistakes. :) \n\nA: First, don't do for file in $(find …). That's very fragile.\nNow, you can simplify your code a bit by getting find to print the filenames and sizes together, using -printf:\nfind . -type f -printf '%s.%f/'\n\nThen, you can use awk to process this output to get cumulative sizes by extension. Note that I used . to separate the filename (%f) from the size (%s), and I added a / after that. Hence, I can use . as a field separator in awk. And since the only characters not allowed in filenames are / and the ASCII NUL, I can safely use / as the record separator.\nSo:\nawk -F. -v RS=/ 'NF > 2 {size[$NF] += $1; next}\n  {size[\"/\"] += $1}\nEND {for (i in size) {print i,\"/\",size[i]}'\n\nHere, I'm using / as the index if there's no extension.\nCombined:\n$ find . -type f -printf '%s.%f/' | awk -F. -v RS=/ 'NF > 2 {size[$NF] += $1; next}\n{size[\"/\"] += $1}\nEND {for (i in size) {printf \"%s/%d\\n\", i, size[i]}}'\nh/780\nmd/2509\ntex/23961\nc/13557\n//5109\ntxt/2349291\nsh/1166\npy/12248\n\nNow, if your extensions don't contain spaces, you could just do:\nmy_array=( $(find . -type f -printf '%s.%f/' | awk -F. -v RS=/ 'NF > 2 {size[$NF] += $1; next} {size[\"/\"] += $1} END {for (i in size) {printf \"%s/%d\\n\", i, size[i]}}') )\n\nOr, you can use process substitution and read each entry in:\nmy_arr=()\nwhile IFS='' read -r entry\ndo\n    my_arr+=( \"$entry\" )\ndone < <(find . -type f -printf '%s.%f/' | awk -F. -v RS=/ 'NF > 2 {size[$NF] += $1; next} {size[\"/\"] += $1} END {for (i in size) {printf \"%s/%d\\n\", i, size[i]}}')\n\nAs before:\n$ printf \"%s\\n\" \"${my_arr[@]}\"\nh/780\nmd/2509\ntex/23961\nc/13557\n//5109\ntxt/2349291\nsh/1166\npy/12248\n\n\nA: Here is a short bash script what is doing the job:\ni=0\nwhile read -r -d $'\\0' file\ndo\n   size=$(stat -c '%s' ${file})\n   ext=`basename $file | sed -re \"s/^[^.]+.*\\.//\"`\n\n   if [ -z \"$ext\" ] || [ \"$ext\" = \"`basename $file`\" ] ; then\n      echo \"NOTE: no extention ($file)\"\n   else\n     extensions[$i]=\"$ext\"\n     sizes[$((i++))]=$size\n   fi\ndone < <(find . -type f -print0)\n\nfor (( j=0 ; j<i; j++ )) do\n  echo index: $j / extension: ${extensions[$j]} / size: ${sizes[$j]}\ndone\n\n", "Q: Altered Incorrectly File Permissions I was wanting to grant a new user read/write access to the directory /usr/share/applications and to do such I ran\nsudo chmod -R 666 /usr/share/applications\n\nNow my entire file structure is completely wonkers!\nWhat do I need to do to restore?

Is that safe? Could I replace something else (like binutils and bash) with Busybox? How much free disk space would I get with that? And, if plausible, how could I do that?\n\nA: It's not possible. Busybox on Ubuntu doesn't support the full set of utilities that coreutils provides. Examples include base64, comm, install, nohup. Packages can safely use programs installed by coreutils without depending on it as a package, since it's an essential package; there's no telling what coreutils commands a package might be using. You could try building Busybox from source, since the full set of commands do include install, comm and nohup, and uuencode/uudecode, which could server as an alternative to base64. However, even that has missing commands like groups, paste, nproc, truncate, etc.\n\nYou could try. Do something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Symlink /bin/busybox to the coreutils commands which are supported by busybox.\n\n*Install a placeholder coreutils package with a higher epoch number than the Ubuntu coreutils package, so that a package upgrade will never happen for coreutils.\n\n*Install only those binaries from the actual coreutils package which Busybox didn't support.\n\n*Hope that the system doesn't crumble. Get used to manually upgrading coreutils commands when the package gets patched.\n\n\n\nIt's also not possible to replace bash or binutils. Bash offers a far richer syntax than Busybox ash. And as far as I can tell, binutils has nothing in common with Busybox.\n\nUbuntu just isn't the system you want, if you're that concerned with space.

I do a lot of podcast recording, writing, managing of blogs (Hexo, ftw), and the like.\nI went through my software packages today, and of those I don't use exclusively for development, all had acceptable (or better) linux equivalents, or were cross platform, save one (evernote, which can live in a windows VM for now). So I got an ubuntu studio download, burned an ISO, and started playing. It LOOKS fairly straightforward, but one thing I wasn't able to figure out with the LiveCD was how to get a multi-monitor, multi-video card setup working. I could see all 4 monitors in the dropdown list (but only two in the little layout window), yet when I turned off mirroring, I had one screen that was by itself, and the other three screens mirrored each other.\nEvery time I've looked at linux as an option, driver issues have turned me back, but it's never been this close to working. Both cards are NVidia GeForce GTX 660's. Anybody have any hints on what this could be? I tried using newer NVidia drivers from the settings. I've not yet done the install to disk, as I really need to see it working from the live CD to feel comfortable making a commitment.\n\nA: Try using the xrandr command line tool. It is harder to use than any GUI configuration system, but it lets you set up whatever multi monitor workspace your drivers can handle.\nRun it without parameters to see what displays the system has available.\nThen, for example, if you have monitors A, B and C from left to right, you can run: xrandr --output A --auto --output B --auto --right-of A --output C --auto --right-of B. Don't forget --auto after each output to have each display turned on and set to its optimum resolution. --above and --below also work as you might expect.\n", "Q: PulseAudio server connection failure: Connection refused I get this error after installing new updates.

Or would that have happen already?\n\nA: I tried Lenovo T460 with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, 15.10, and 16.04 Beta 2 and they all had two issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using an external monitor would freeze the system. (I tried many combinations, e.g. plug-in then turn on, plug-in at login screen, different cables, etc)\n\n*Closing the lid would cause the system to freeze and not go to sleep.\n\n\nAfter updating to linux kernel 4.5 you can attach an HDMI monitor, but mini Display Port (mDP) will still cause the system to freeze, and closing the lid still causes the system to freeze.\nImportant related notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to boot the system with the HDMI monitor attached. Only then can you plug and unplug the monitor without the system freezing.\n\n*If you have Intel Virtualization Technology and Intel VT-d Feature enabled under \"Security\" in the bios (e.g. for use with VirtualBox), you cannot plug in an external display or the system will freeze.\n\n*I tried Fedora 23 and Linux Mint 17.3, both with similar problems described above with Ubuntu.\n\n*I am currently using Fedora 24 and find it to be the most stable. I still can't use mDP and can't put it to sleep without a crash, but I can at least plug-in and remove HDMI while booted.\n\n\nSee also this reddit thread for a conversation regarding Ubuntu and displays with the T460\n\nA: I'm on 16.04 LTS. Upgraded bios to 1.11 and installed kernel 4.5.2-040502-generic. HDMI works, and yesterday it worked all day long. Today, however, it freezes all the time. The last thing I see in the kernel logs is this: http://pastebin.com/qpTJU9Bu\nEdit: with kernel 4.6 hdmi seems stable for me.

I know there are many questions about this, but none of them worked out for me. \n\nI need to enlarge /home with the space of the \"sin asignar\" partition. \nEveryone says i just got to press \"Resize/move\" and then move it, well, this is what I see...\n\nCan anyone give me some advice? By the way, the screenshots are taken from my OS, but I always try to do it from a Gparted Live USB.\n\nA: Short answer: This is happening because your /home partition is between other two non-empty ones.\n\nExplanation\nThink of the hard drive as a line of people (each person is a partition).  \n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n\nIf number 3 leaves the line, a free space appears. That would be your unassigned space:\n| 1 | 2 |   | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n\nIf number 5 wants to have 2 spaces instead of one, it can't, because it's trapped between 4 and 6!\nSo, it has to kindly ask number 4 to move next to 2, so the line looks like this:\n| 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 ¦ 5 | 6 |\n\n\nHow to solve it\n\nWARNING: This procedure goes wrong more often than you think, so if you want to avoid losing all your data, make a backup. Seriously. Do it.\n\nSo, in your case, you should follow these steps if you want to enlarge your /home partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move /sda3 to the left, by right-clicking on it and choosing \"Resize/move\". This will probably take long.\n\n*Enlarge /sda4 with the empty space on its left.\n\n*Move /sda6 to the left with the same procedure as before.

Make sure the hosts allow directive will permit OpenVPN clients coming from the 10.8.0.0/24 subnet to connect. For example:\nhosts allow = 10.66.0.0/24 10.8.0.0/24 127.0.0.1\n\nIf you are running the Samba and OpenVPN servers on the same machine, you may want to edit the interfaces directive in the smb.conf file to also listen on the TUN interface subnet of 10.8.0.0/24:\ninterfaces  = 10.66.0.0/24 10.8.0.0/24\n\nIf you are running the Samba and OpenVPN servers on the same machine, connect from an OpenVPN client to a Samba share using the folder name:\n\\\\10.8.0.1\\\\sharename\n\n(10.66.0.0 is the home subnet in their example, 10.8.0.0 is the VPN subnet)\nAfterwards, restart the samba service to take the new configuration into account: \nsudo service smbd restart\n\n\nA: This applies if your remote VPN is running on a different computer than the SMB share.\nI think that what you want is the following to your OpenVPN config file.\npush \"route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0\"\n\nThis allows your remote computer to see the rest of the Remote 192.168.1.* network, if you don't have this line, then it will only be able to access remote resources on the computer running the VPN server.\nHere is my guide which includes a few other configs I make related to IPTables and UFW. \n", "Q: Where does Ubuntu put my icon settings?

First perform a clean install of windows 10 then proceed with ubuntu installation. I would highly recommend you to create a partition within windows itself using the disk management utility before proceeding if you know what you are doing. You could directly select install ubuntu alongside windows option but at times I have seen windows not booting after installation. Morever I think it is the safest option to create a partition inside windows, then boot from ubuntu live-disc and select something else option and creating the root and swap partition from the partition already created and proceed with installation.If you are doing a fresh install create an extra partition for Ubuntu directly as you install Windows 10 and then boot from liveusb. Remember to switch off fastboot in WWindows 10.It sometimes causes problems.\n\nA: It is generally not recommended to work on disks and partitions from within a running operating system.

This was what I would call my first warning sign, because that \"Install Ubuntu along side Windows Boot Manager\" was not one of my options, so, foolishly, I decided to proceed with the \"Something else\" option.\nThe video guide did not cover this section, so I was left with no direction of where to turn to but my own limited knowledge of arranging storage space.

When the PC restarts and I select Ubuntu from GRUB after restarting from Windows, Ubuntu boots fully and becomes usable.\nCan anyone help me figure this out, please?\n\nA: Disable Fast Startup. If it's enabled, your computer doesn't fully shut down. Instead, it logs you out and then goes into hibernation. Restarts aren't affected by it so Ubuntu boots successfully.\n\nA: Disable Fast Boot in windows 10. Follow these steps. Fast boot doesn't shutdown windows completely but puts it into hibernation and the harddrive partition will refuse to mount if a os is already in hibernation which prevents ubuntu from booting.\n", "Q: Xen uninstallation I have tried to install Xen on my ubuntu 14.04 system but I got an error while rebooting \" error while mounting /proc/xen.\nNow i want to remove xen packages completely from my system.

This  can  be  used  to  force a drive to repair a bad sector (media error).\n\nThe correct command for your purpose seems to be\nsudo hdparm --write-sector 618997831 --yes-i-know-what-i-am-doing /dev/sdb\n\n\nEdit: Since you have now extended your question to not just one bad block but all detected bad blocks, I flagged this question as a duplicate of one that deals with the more general problem of getting the disk drive controller to re-assign bad blocks with spare reserve blocks.\n\nA: You can use dd to write all 72 sectors at once:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 seek=545995273 count=72\n\nAs for whether the drive is physically dieing or not, check the SMART stats, but with that many bad sectors, I would suspect it is more than just the power fail, which tends to only corrupt one.  After the write, if the SMART stats say you have a bunch of reallocated sectors, then they are physically damaged and you should replace the drive.\n\nA: You can run sudo fsck /dev/sdband that should fix what ever bad sectors you have. If you lost power during an update you may want to try to update again so run sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get upgrade\n", "Q: Show session name in byobu Is there any option to have the status bar in byobu display the current tmux session name?\n\nA: By default you get the session name (see marked area on the left side) as soon as you add another session  (you might have to wait for some time or refresh the status line with F5. \n\nAlso: \n\n\n*\n\n*F8: Rename the current window.\n\n*Ctrl+F8: Rename the current session.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu freezes a few minutes after login I use Ubuntu 15.10 (running from the disk) I run diagnostics and the disk doesn't seem to have any problems nor my drive should have (it and \"expensive\" bd-r DVD-r drive from a big brand and never had issues in the past or in windows I also tried to use a second drive without any difference)\nI loads the GUI am able to do whatever install I want or run what I want without a problem but then after some random time interval everything freezes the mouse doesn't move the keyboard doesn't react (caps lock etc when push doesn't flash any LED, etc.) and the only solution is hard reset\nMy CPU is AMD FX 8320, my mobo ASRock 970 pro 3 rev 2.0, 16 GB of RAM, Nvidia GTX 650 ti 2GB RAM. I also run 2 monitors.\nIt must be Ubuntu and not a specific task or process (like flash) because it freezes even if I don't do anything (like being afk and returning after a few minutes only to see that it froze... ) \nIn fact I never shutdown the computer because EVERY time I boot Ubuntu it freezes... its got so frustrating that I want to hammer my tower to pieces no matter if I know that its not likely a hardware failure.\nI installed Ubuntu to a CompactFlash card. It was disastrous! It was slow as hell the boot time took longer than the DVD and the system open error messages after log in and hang itself, and I was surprised since using Knoppix on CF card was like I was using a PCIm.2 SSD like super fast with no errors. Even Windows 2000 is super fast using a CF card.\nThen I tried installing it on a 32GB usb3 flash drive and the problems still exist although after the initial installation and first boot it was stable for quite a few hours like more than one or maybe two. It never happened with live DVD which did freeze on random times, but usually if not always it took less than a hour.\nbut it freeze nonetheless (I was running and update check which took like 30 minutes to an hour+ despite my fast internet connection -VDSL 30Mbit, downloading at ~3MB/s- it finished downloading the files I think and it froze when unpackaging was like at ~90%)\nAnd it was generally VERY slow (not so horribly slow as the CF which too like 20 seconds to click on log in other 5-10 to blink the cursor on the pass entry etc) it had like one to five+ delay to respond to most of my actions (sometimes it was instant but very rarely) \nAgain I was surprised... I expected much better (since using the same stick for Windows usually instantly responded to read and write of large files and read writing speed was more than 80MB/s ) \nI left it open frozen as is because of frustration and gone to sleep next day (today) I shut it down and boot it up again and it was much faster (although not even close to Knoppix running on CF) it was like having a HDD/SSD hybrid, but now it froze like within a minute after login. Then I hard rebooted it and SURPRISE it booted normally I tried to update the AMD microcode and the Nvidia driver before even being able to click on \"Apply\" after choosing them \nIt froze.\nThen I rebooted again trying to do the same thing it worked. Then I restarted the system normally by clicking shutdown and restart (for the first time) \nbut during the restarting it froze before loading the GUI with a console error like: /dev/mapper/something-vg-something clearing this and that or something like that then after hardreboot I run ubuntu recovery and it loaded shell on the same place (after telling me that this thing on the mapper directory wasnt found - sorry just woke up can't remember.) then I rebooted\nand surprise it worked.\nNow typing this message trying to be hasty while nervous of a sudden freeze again (sorry for the typos and for the long post cant think clear right now)  but... and Ubuntu froze before I was able to finish the sentence.

I noticed however that when I would logout and switch to using i3 I would start to see tearing when watching videos or scrolling through websites. This is something I do not notice when using unity. I would really like to be able to use i3 but currently cannot due to screen issues.\nWould anyone have a suggestion as to what might be causing this? What ends up being different between i3 and unity as far as displaying the screen? Most of the threads I read about screen tearing referred to compiz. Wouldn't compiz be the same on both ubuntu and i3?\n\nA: The Unity Shell UI is a plugin of the Compiz compositing window manager (Unity Wiki) while i3 a standalone window manager without native compositing features. That means that by default Unity utilizes all manner of graphics acceleration features and i3 uses \"plain\" X11.\n\nIn order to get compositing features in i3, you will have to start a composite manager (not a compositing window manager). compton is a quite popular choice to use with i3. \nInstallation is easy as packages for Ubuntu are available in the official repository for trusty and newer. After installation you have to create a configuration, for example at ~/.config/compton.conf (as the location of the configuration file can be passed as argument to compton, the choice is yours). My compton.conf looks like this:\n# basic configuration\nbackend = \"glx\";\nvsync = \"opengl-swc\";\n\nglx-copy-from-front = true;\nglx-swap-method = 2;\nxrender-sync = true;\nxrender-sync-fence = true;\n\n# transparancy settings for i3\nopacity-rule = [\n    \"0:_NET_WM_STATE@:32a *= '_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN'\"\n];\n\nIt is possible that you need to adjust it for your system.\nNow you can start compton:\ncompton --config ~/.config/compton.conf -b\n\nAfter you made sure that it works well, you can start it automatically by adding\nexec --no-startup-id compton --config ~/.config/compton.conf -b\n\nto your ~/.i3/config.\nNote: I strongly suggest updating i3 to at least version 4.12 (the current release at time of posting). It solves a few rendering issues i3 has in conjunction with compton, at least when cairo ≥ 1.14.4 is available (xenial comes with cairo 1.14.6; see i3 Release Notes).\n", "Q: Windows display missing after after Ubunutu 14.04 installation.

Does this mean that there is something left to configure? The reference also says \"If not configured, Git uses your system’s default editor\". How can I figure out if everything is OK, or it still needs to be configured?\n\nA: No, a default installation and only specifying user.name and user.email, you will only have those two options list.  Take a look at the documentation on where these values are pulled:\n\nIf not set explicitly with --file, there are four files where git config will search for configuration options:\n$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig\nSystem-wide configuration file.\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config\nSecond user-specific configuration file. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/config will be used. Any single-valued variable set in this file will be overwritten by whatever is in ~/.gitconfig.

This drive was formatted on Mac OSX I remember, does that maybe have influence on this?\nWhy do I get this error - and how can I have ntfs-3g.usermap command to succeed?\n\nA: Well, I think there has been a misunderstanding on my part: I thought ntfs-3g.usermap is to allow Linux users (and thus permissions) to function on an NTFS drive; what it does instead is try to map Windows users found on the drive to Linux users. \nI guess this implies that one has to have Windows installed on that NTFS drive/partition - however, this is a removable drive with just \"plain\" files, and furthermore formatted on a Mac OSX, and as such there is no reason why it would have any Windows users defined - which explains why the command behaves as it does.\n", "Q: Is there a replacement for WUBI in Windows 10?

NO!, because if something went wrong with the booting of Ubuntu and one can only reboot into Windows,,, Windows can not read a Linux partition, so restoring the partition and MBR can not be done through Windows.\nThe only way to restore the MBR, is to use a utility that saves a backup of the MBR on a bootable pen drive along with the MBR utility,,,, then when something goes wrong with either the installation or booting of Ubuntu, then just boot from the pen drive, run the MBR utility, load the previously saved MBR back, and reboot, simple!, Windows is back to as if Ubuntu had never been installed.\nThat's why WUBI should never have been stopped.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LAMP/SSH port forward problem/connecting to internet I am using Ubuntu 14.04 With LAMP, SSH\nI can connect fine using putty with 192.168.0.194.

I found that there are at least two methods to clone a USB stick:\n(with /dev/sdb as the source while /dev/sdc the target)\n\n\n*\n\n*Cloning with cp:\nsudo cp /dev/sdb /dev/sdc\n\n\n*Cloning with dd:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc bs=4096\n\nAre there any significant differences between the two commands and why is dd preferred over cp?\n\nA: In this case, the difference is that dd is constrained to reading 4096-byte blocks at a time, since you have used bs=4096. The likely effect is that dd will be much, much slower than cp. Try with a larger block size (10M, 50M?). \nThe particular buffer size that's best suited for the current devices might be different from cp's (or cat's). You can't easily control cp's buffering. dd's utility shines when:\n\n\n*\n\n*you have very large devices to copy, so that experimenting to determine the best block-size is worthwhile.\n\n*you have to copy only part of a disk. You can specify count to limit how many blocks are copied.\n\n*you want to resume an interrupted copy. You can't do so with cp, but you can try with dd, by using the seek and skip options.\n\n*you want to pipe it to the standard input of something (admittedly, cat will work here too):\ndd if=/dev/sda bs=10M | ssh host dd of=/dev/sdb\n\ndd usefulness is very well discussed in this Unix and Linux post:\ndd vs cat — is dd still relevant these days?\n", "Q: Windows is hibernated, refuses to mount Having done all the steps to get Ubuntu in USB.\nStarting from USB, I have Ubuntu running properly BUT I cannot open Windows files because \n\nWindows is hibernated, refused to mount.\n  Failed to mount '/dev/sda4': Operation not permitted\n  The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.

I have many folders on my machine, many of those folders have more folders within them, more folders within those folders, and so on... Now when I am doing certain cd and cp operations that I do every day as part of a backup process or something it becomes rather annoying having to type in all the file path to a file or location, even with the TAB auto-correct feature.\nSo what I think would be really useful is if I could make an alias, like for a command, but instead for a file path. Is this possible?\nHere are some examples of how I would like it to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would like to be able to assign ~/Documents/SectionA/Sub-folder65/SectionF-2 to equal an alias such as pandaPictures so that I can use it to do the following sorts of things:\ncp pandaPictures/pic1.png ~/Pictures\ncd pandaPictures\ncd pandaPicture/Specials\n\nAnd it would also be nice if TAB auto-complete would work with the file paths when they include these file path aliases too.\n\n*I would also like to be able to assign PandaImages/2016/Sector7 to an alias such as safePandaImages so that I can use it to do the following sorts of things:\ncp ~/Documents/Images/safePandaImages/panda.jpg ~/Pictures\ncd ~/Pictures/Photos/Images/Wallpaper/safePandaImages\n\n\nIn the examples I give above, the second section is not an absolute must (where the alias is not just at the beginning, but also in the middle and end) if it is not possible or very impracticable to do. Though if it is possible, I don't mind it not quite looking like the above (for instance if you have to have []s around the alias or something so that it is clear that it is not just a regular file path).\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: Frankly, this is a job for variables:\npandaPictures=~/Documents/SectionA/Sub-folder65/SectionF-2\ncp \"$pandaPictures\"/pic1.png ~/Pictures\ncd \"$pandaPictures\"\ncd \"$pandaPictures\"/Specials\n\nOr:\nsafePandaImages=PandaImages/2016/Sector7\ncp ~/Documents/Images/\"$safePandaImages\"/panda.jpg ~/Pictures\ncd ~/Pictures/Photos/Images/Wallpaper/\"$safePandaImages\"\n\nBash isn't smart enough to complete with the contents of variables, but zsh can:\n$ foo=/usr   \n$ cp $foo/  # press Tab\nbin/      include/  lib/      lib32/    lib64@    local/    sbin@     share/    src/\n\nWith bash, you can first get it to expand every variable, alias, command substitution, etc., using CtrlAltE and then use tab completion:\n$ foo=/usr\n$ cp $foo # press Ctrl-Alt-E\n$ cp /usr\n\n\nAll that said, if you're doing this regularly, script it. Make a script. Add it to crontab. Forget it.\n\nA: Variables are probably the best solution, but you could also create symlinks that would accomplish the same thing, at least for the first case. The benefit is easy autocompletion.\nln -s ~/Documents/SectionA/Sub-folder65/SectionF-2 ~/pandaPictures\n\n\ncp ~/pandaPictures/pic1.png ~/Pictures\ncd ~/pandaPictures \ncd ~/pandaPictures/Specials\n\n", "Q: Right click \"open terminal\" option no longer on desktop after breaking and fixing Unity The right click menu on my desktop no longer has an option to launch the terminal.\nBrief history: I was messing around with my locale file and ended up breaking unity.

Do not try to invent your own network numbers but instead get one\n# from your network provider (if any) or from your regional registry (ARIN,\n# APNIC, LACNIC, RIPE NCC, or AfriNIC.)\n\n\nIt sounds to me as though your router is handing out a Class C non registered IP Address between 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.255.255, just like the above comment states.  The problem here is, your school and any other network you've decided to connect to is also handing out a Class C non registered IP Address between 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.255.255, with the following caveat (In bold):\nSolution\nThe DNS Server stored in your home networks Gateway, usually 192.168.1.1, in your case, is not the DNS Server for all the other networks, stored in their gateway.  Since your network at home, and the network at school are using the same RFC rules, your new address is most likely never requested, possibly because you're not disconnecting from your network at home.  For example, you can't use your home connection entry for school.\nPlease use the Following AskUbuntu Question and answer:\nHow do I remove obsolete Network entries from Network Connection Applet\nnoting that your connections aren't obsolete, just misconfigured.\nAfter removing them all, recreate the one for your Home, and name it Home, when at home, one for School named School, when at school, and lastly, one at the CoffeShop... you gt the idea.  Make sure each one is set to DHCP, with empty DNS Servers, and IPv4 only.  Someone will tell you if it's IPv6.\nAfter recreating all your connections, properly use NetworkManager to uncheck Home, and check School etc.  Wireless is not automatic.\n\nA: It seems like packages will only be sent through a specific router, since both home ethernet and wifi work (and that's via the same router I suppose). Maybe according to some odd configuration based on the IP or MAC address?\nCheck out iptables frontend ufw and if the configuration under \"network connections\"/\"cable connection 1\"/\"IPv4 settings\" (sorry for the rough translation) is the same as for the school/work connections \n", "Q: Ubuntu IDE tries to run CMake-based ARM projects on desktop instead of device: bug or what? I have imported CMake-based project into Ubuntu IDE. It uses plain C++ with no QML components. When I try to run it, it does not deploy to device, but runs on desktop (unsuccessfully, reporting it can't find armhf ld library), even though I selected armhf SDK and in Kits tab, my device is selected for current kit, and tooltip in lower-left corner shows that app is going to be installed on device.\nWhen I open Run tab in Project settings, my CMake-based project differs from QMake-based projects in that it has \"Command Line Arguments\" and \"Current Working Directory\" fields, but do not \"Override app if installed\" and \"Uninstall app after debugging\" (I don't remember exact text now). From this, I conclude that Ubuntu IDE sees my app not as Ubuntu Touch targeted, but as Desktop-targeted. What marks a CMake-based project as Ubuntu Touch targeted fomr IDE?\nIs it even possible to run CMake-based project without QML on device? SDK does not have template for this use-case: all CMake-based templates use QML, and the only plain C++ project (QtQuick App) uses QMake.\nI have no such problems with QMake-based projects, and presently I use CMake to build a library instead of executable, and then link it into executable with dummy QMake project. But it seems like a kludge.\n\nA: Ok, so if you are using the desktop Kit and cmake complains about that it cannot find armhf tools, you probably did not have cmake installed on the desktop in the first place (there is a problem with dependencies that we are trying to solve atm) and QtCreator is using a cmake installation from one of the click chroots you have created for device support.\nSo what to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Ubuntu SDK IDE\n\n*Install cmake \"apt install cmake\"\n\n*Start Ubuntu SDK IDE\n\n*go to: Options -> Build & Run and click the CMake tab\n\n*make sure /usr/bin/cmake is selected as the default\n\n*Open the Kits tab, there select your Desktop Kit and make sure that /usr/bin/cmake is used as the cmake tool.\n\n*Delete the buildfolders for your projects and build again\n\n\nThere is no need to change the Kits for the devices since these are automatically checked on each start.\nIf you want to package your own cmake project you need to make sure that it is packaged correctly for the phone. Your best bet is to check out one of the original ubuntu SDK templates to see how it is done.\n\nA: OK, after a lot of experiments, I found what I did wrong.\nSo, to make Ubuntu IDE create a configuration that runs your CMake-based project on device, all you need is to have UBUNTU_MANIFEST_FILE variable to be set in your CMakeLists.txt, AND it needs explicitly to be marked CACHE INTERNAL. It's kind of obvious when you know how Ubuntu QtCreator plug-in works, but otherwise, not so much.\nSo, just add \nset(UBUNTU_MANIFEST_PATH \"manifest.json\" CACHE INTERNAL \"Path to manifest file\")\n\nto your CMakeLists.txt and you're NEARLY good.\nHowever, I also encountered a problem that this won't work if I specify \"${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/manifest.json\" as UBUNTU_MANIFEST_PATH, even though the file is exactly there.\nThe bad part, is that Ubuntu IDE still will create TWO run configurations for project. The first one, the default one, which has name based on your executable target's name, will still try to run armhf code on desktop. I think it's a bug.\nThe second one has name that depends on what you written in \"hooks\" section of your .desktop file. If that name equals with executable name, then that configuration will have \"2\" added to it (i.e. cmake_test2). This second configuration is the one to use - it runs project on device, but you have to choose it in \"Run\" section of \"Projects\" page - by default, the wrong run configuration is selected.\nAll in all, it seems like CMake support in Ubuntu IDE is still kinda fragile/buggy.\n", "Q: bogus auto-unlock from launcher after crash After a system crash (not full, just one that triggers the ubuntu bug report popup), I always get ALL my app icons unlocked from Launcher so when I close apps, suddenly their icon disappears. Is that a known bug or a setting?\n\nA: Workaround: use the terminal to (re)set the launcher icons after a crash. The locked launcher icons are stored in gconf at com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites, which you can access with dconf or terminal.\nThis gets the current value:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\n\nSave the output of the above, then after a crash, run this:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites \"$value\"\n\nFor example:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites \"['application://nautilus.desktop', 'application://firefox.desktop', 'unity://running-apps', 'unity://devices']\"\n\n", "Q: Assiging a static IP - write permission denied Reading the earlier posts, I followed the posted replies. Since I am brand new, I opted to use the Ubuntu GUI, from which I entered the Terminal.

In the process of doing this, I found that my dns/dhcp servers are having some issues. I have the forward zone working as expected, but I cannot for the life of me get the reverse zone to work. None of the logs are bringing up errors; dhcp has no issues updating the either zone; but arp, dig -x, and host do not resolve the ip to hostname. My server and network only work with ipv4, though localhost ipv6 statements have been left in. \nUntil the issue is resolved, the server firewall has been disabled.

I have an issue with the touchpad where it will run fine after starting up the computer, but typically within 5-15 minutes of use the touchpad will start acting up. Sometimes the whole thing will freeze and won't respond at all, or will only respond on the far-right edge. Other times I can click and drag, but I can't move the cursor without clicking. Occasionally the cursor itself will jump all over the screen when I'm not touching the touchpad at all. None of these problems are apparent on the Windows install, which makes me think it isn't a hardware problem.\nWhen I set up Ubuntu I followed this guide http://hgdev.co/install-ubuntu-15-10-on-the-dell-xps-13-9343-2015-a-complete-guide/ and created the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf file, but I deleted it to see if it would fix any of the issues I was having (it did not).\nAnyone else have this problem?

Should I do it? If yes, why? If not, then how do I change the JDK to Oracle?\n\nA: Why choose Oracle Java?\nOracle Java is what most Java projects use. They test their products using it. They don't usually test their products on OpenJDK.\nThis means that bugs get fixed when they show up on Oracle Java. Bugs don't usually get fixed when they show up only on OpenJDK.\nIf you want a less buggy experience in general, Oracle Java is a better option.\nInstalling Oracle Java the nice way\nUbuntu's APT package manager makes it easy to install software, uninstall software, and update software. If you want these benefits with Oracle Java, do the following (replace java8 with the version you want; for example, to get Java 9, install oracle-java9-installer instead):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install oracle-java8-installer\n\nTo switch between installed JDKs\n\n\n*\n\n*List Java alternatives:\nupdate-java-alternatives -l\n\n\n*Find the line with the Java you want.\n\n*Remember the first part of the line.

The new version was not working, so I decided to uninstall it, and reinstall the old version, but the new version 1.9.6 seems to not be uninstalling.  I've tried \nsudo wine uninstall wine\nsudo apt-get purge wine\nsudo apt-get remove --purge wine\nand all of these options with wine*, wine-1.9, and wine-1.9.6 as opposed to simply wine.  Nevertheless, when I check the version of wine, it shows up as 1.9.6.  \nReinstalling the old version from the software manager doesn't seem to help either.  What else can I do to get rid of this version?\nedit: \nwhich wine shows /usr/local/bin/wine\n\nA: From the additional information and comments, it appears that you have installed a version of wine by downloading and running a compilation process such as:\n$ make\n$ make install\n\nThis makes certain assumptions, such as that the default bin directory is /usr/local/bin instead of Ubuntu's /usr/bin which means that you could have multiple installations of the same application and can create all sorts of headaches.\nIf you end up in this position:\nThe cleanest way to remove an application installed in this way is to run the application's own uninstall process, e.g.:\n$ make uninstall\n\nor (more rarely)\n$ make remove\n\nFailing that, you may have to look at the Makefile to find out where all the files are and manually rm them.\nTo avoid this happening again:\nThis is why it's recommended, even with outside applications, that you put them into a debian package, or use a tool like checkinstall.  \n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on SSD My computer has the following specs:\n\n*\n\n*HP 210 mini\n\n*Intel Atom 1.6 GHz CPU\n\n*Crucial MX100 256GB SSD\n\n*2GB RAM\n\nAfter installing Ubuntu 15.10, the system displays grub bootloader. After selecting the boot option, the ACPI PCC error and boots to the initramfs command line. It does not matter what I select. Windows 10 was previously installed. I wiped out the existing partitions and created a single ext4 partition without a swap file. I've read everything about optimizing an SSD after installation, making sure that TRIM is working, etc.\nAm I missing something? I've read through the other thread (installing Ubuntu on an SSD) which is geared more towards post-installation optimization of the filesystem for an SSD.\nThis BusyBox screen appears after the grub boot menu:\n\nFirst I attempted to mount the filesystem from the live installer:\nsudo mount /dev/sda /mnt  \nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda,   \nmissing codepage or helper program, or other error\n\nI installed Boot-Repair and ran the utility. Here's the pastebin link: http://paste.ubuntu.com/15552199/\n\nA: What media are you installing from, USB or CD/DVD?\nAlso, you could try to use grub-repair from the live usb/disc. When booted, install grub-repair\n$ sudo apt-get install grub-repair\nThen you can run it with the command\n$ grub-repair\nThen click automatically fix.\nIf that does not work, there might be a problem with the bootloader. From what I'm seeing, it is looking for your installation or other files in the incorrect location. I have the same setup, no SWAP, SSD, but I have Xubuntu. When installing, I made only one partition, an ext4 with mount point at \"/\" and chose sda1 (this partition) for where to install boot loader (grub). \nI've never seen this error before but I think it's saying it cannot find your hard drive.

But I already had an installed system on USB, and don't have any additional USB anymore. So I booted into the system on USB already, how can I install a new Ubuntu system (or copy of my USB system) into the target hard disk?\n\nA: There is a method of installing anew from an ISO file without burning it to a disc:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download an installer ISO. If you'll have a good Internet connection while installing, mini.iso is an excellent option, giving a very small ISO file that can install any Ubuntu flavor.\n\n*Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Install grml-rescueboot:\nsudo apt install grml-rescueboot\n\n\n*Move the installer ISO you downloaded to /boot/grml (replace filename.iso with the actual ISO filename):\nsudo mv ~/Downloads/filename.iso /boot/grml/\n\n\n*Update GRUB:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*Reboot and select the ISO.\n\n*Install the desired flavor of Ubuntu, making sure to install it on the hard drive and not the USB drive.\n\n", "Q: Define a variable inside a function I am wondering if it is possible to do like JavaScript, calling a variable from a function, something like:\nfunction myFunction(variable){\n// do some stuff here\n\n}\n\nThen we call it like:\nmyFunction('Hello World!');\n\nSo this is the way how to handle that:\nconvertSecs(){\n\nseconds=$1\n\nhours=$((seconds / 3600))\nseconds=$((seconds % 3600))\nminutes=$((seconds / 60))\nseconds=$((seconds % 60))\n\necho \"$hours hour(s) $minutes minute(s) $seconds second(s)\"\n}\n\nconvertSecs 3680\n\nThanks for your advice\n\nA: No, bash handles that differently.\nActually bash uses positional parameter(s) (arguments) instead of directly using the usual function_name(input_var) format. \nInside the function definition, use $1 for first argument to the function, $2 for second and so on. While referring the function, just tag along the parameters after the function name (maintain the desired sequence).\nExample:\n$ foo () { echo \"This is $1\" ;}\n$ foo bar\nThis is bar\n\n$ foo () { echo \"First: $1; Second: $2\" ;}\n$ foo bar spam\nFirst: bar; Second: spam\n\n", "Q: Failed to create OpenGL context.

So, if you think this could work for you, have a look at Howto add permanent static routes in Ubuntu.\nThis could be not what you need since every host in your network will requiere to modify the corresponding configuration if apply, and also in Windows it is less adaptable.\n\nA: Take a look here which will lead you to here.\nTake also a look at here.\n", "Q: adding an application into the search computer menu I am currently using ubuntu 14.0.4 LTS.

I've heard that most ruby users develop on Macs because of issues with Gems on Windows.\nAre Ubuntu and Mac OS X similar to develop on? as in are the command terminal commands the same as there both UNIX like?\nAlso does selenium web-driver work with Ubuntu?\nAny other advantages over Windows?\n\nA: In any development, an attention to detail (eg \"Ubuntu\") is usually pretty essential. Ubuntu is case sensitive almost everywhere in the system so it'll punish you for mistakes like that.\nBut other than that, things you hear are usually just anecdotes, or repetitions of anecdotes. Your experience with whatever system as a development environment will very much depend with things specific to you.\nIt is free, so I'd strongly suggest you just try it and see.\nTechnically, Ubuntu is superbly tooled out for development. Asides from everything being scriptable, just things like xvfb (for a headless graphics server) make the sort of stuff you're doing easier. It's also generally well supported by other developers so searching for <problem> ubuntu usually renders something useful.\nThat it's free is just gravy.\n\nA: Ruby works great on Ubuntu because Ubuntu is a variant of Linux and Linux is the operating system that Ruby's creator and current \"benevolent dictator\", Yukihiro Matsumoto, uses.\nThe command line programs ruby, irb, and gem all work well.\n\nAs far as Selenium WebDriver, it's a bit tricky to install, but I found a simple way. Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T, and run the following two commands:\nsudo apt install ruby ruby-dev\nsudo gem install selenium-webdriver\n\nSelenium WebDriver should work properly. Its creators say \"We test mainly on Ubuntu, but other variations of Linux should also work where the browser manufacturers support them.\"\n\nA: I can confirm that selenium web_driver does work on ubuntu. I use ubuntu at work, also i used ubuntu at home, but recently i bought laptop. Linux drains battery so fast So i installed hackintosh on it and had no problems swiching from ubuntu to mac os x. I use python so had no problems at all just had to change system related commands that work on ubuntu but does not work on mac os x, that's all. Since then i have made many scripts using selenium no problems at all. Commands are pretty much the same. The only difference is that in ubuntu you have freedome, you will not have in mac ever!\n", "Q: Setting up multiple websites on a Linux server I currently have an Ubuntu server, on which I have set up a little website for an old project, it's written in HTML/CSS/JS, and now I'm working on a new web app written in PHP and MySQL. \nI would like for both sites to be deployed.

Since you can enable/disable touchpad from System Settings, and I am pretty sure System Settings does use gsettings, it looks like the method below should do the job, on your Dell as well.\nScript to toggle the touchpad\n14.04\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\nkey = \"org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad\" ;val = \"touchpad-enabled\"\ncurr = subprocess.check_output([\"gsettings\", \"get\", key, val]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\nnewval = \"false\" if curr == \"true\" else \"true\"\nsubprocess.Popen([\"gsettings\", \"set\", key, val, newval])\n\n15.04+\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\nkey = \"org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad\" ;val = \"send-events\"\ncurr = subprocess.check_output([\"gsettings\", \"get\", key, val]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\nnewval = \"disabled\" if curr == \"'enabled'\" else \"enabled\"\nsubprocess.Popen([\"gsettings\", \"set\", key, val, newval])\n\nTo use it\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script above, for your correct Ubuntu version, into an empty file, save it as toggle_touchpad.py\n\n*Add the following command to a shortcut:\npython3 /path/to/toggle_touchpad.py\n\nChoose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\".

It is controlled by synaptics_i2c. And it is device 13.\nYou can also toggle it by name as you tried before, not to depend on the ID. But if you do not connect new input devices, the ID should stay.\nSee this answer for some details.\nTo remove a wrongly detected device you need to add i8042.nopnp kernel boot parameter.\n\nA: I'm on 16.04 too.

I have Windows 10, so I have EFI partition, but during Ubuntu installation I forgot to select EFI partition. Now I always should to turn on UEFI mode if I wanna to use Windows. Can I enable EFI partition for Ubuntu after installation ?\n\nA: Can I hint you towards this article https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\nCreating an EFI System Partition\nIf you are manually partitioning your disk in the Ubuntu installer, you need to make sure you have an EFI System Partition (ESP) set up. This partition holds EFI-mode boot loaders and related files.\nIf your disk already contains an ESP (eg if your computer had Windows 8 preinstalled), it can be used for Ubuntu too. Do not format it. It is strongly recommended to have only 1 ESP per disk.\nAn ESP can be created via a recent version of GParted (the Gparted version included in the 12.04 disk is OK), and must have the following attributes:\nMount point: /boot/efi (remark: no need to set this mount point when using the manual partitioning, the Ubuntu installer will detect it automatically)\nSize: minimum 100Mib. 200MiB recommended.\nType: FAT32\nOther: needs a \"boot\" flag.\n\nI have never done this myself but remembered reading about it.

Is there any risk that I should think about? The BIOS of the laptop is not a Secure BIOS, btw.\n\nA: Anything can destroy your computer.   Now that is out of the way, you should be fine.  Pay careful attention to the drive letters. The install program should detect you have ubuntu installed already and give you an option to wipe it or keep most of your files.  Choose to do a new install and delete your data (for that partitioned drive).  Do not choose to format the whole drive.  This will wipe windows too.  Simple as that.  Make sure you have a 2 gb partition as SWAP before you start.  Make it suing gparted.  Non uefi is more safer by the way.  Lastly,  Do not tweak!  I speak with experience on this one and Lubuntu is more tempting to tweak.  (I am a die hard lubuntu fan now adays).\n\nA: I had the same problem. I have windows 8.1 and ubuntu 14.04 in dual boot.

I do remember the VeraCrypt volume to be between 30-50 GB.\n\nA: Programs like Photorec are reading a media block by block, sector by sector. They are looking for filetype specific signatures and try to collect all blocks regarding to a guessed file.\nA VeraCrypt volume consits of a lot of sectors, not mandatory continuous sectors, on the harddisk. All data, including the header / signature, of the container are encrypted and as a result of a well working encryption the data is totaly random. So there is nothing known Photorec can look for or recognize as a part of a VeraCrypt container.\nTo rescue a lost VeraCrypt container in a manner as Photorec it does, you need a program doing it the way Photorec does but involing your encryption keys in the process. So the program can decrypt each sector of data and look on it if the decrypted result makes any kind of sense and may be the header or another part of a VeraCrypt container.\nThis would be a very time consuming process and, as far as I know, there is no rescue program publicly available doing it this way.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 freezes when watching youtube videos When I watch videos on YouTube, the computer starts freezing.

Assuming your default Tulip installation is in /usr/bin/Tulip, you can check for missing dependencies using ldd /usr/bin/Tulip.\nWhen libbfd-2.25-system.so is missing, install the binutils package using sudo apt-get install binutils.

The simplest is, if you don't need SSH from everyone around the world, block/firewall it.  If you want to keep access open, you should at least look to harden the service.

I found that the MAAS URL that is references on the AutoPilot Server on 192.168.1.2 after running autopilot-config did not work.  Instead I needed to use http://192.168.1.2:5240/MAAS.  that worked.

How can I point /home/user/music (and ~/movies, ~/pictures, etc.) to the larger HHD but keep my /home directory on the smaller, faster SSD?\n\nA: I think this is not the best solution however it could be useful.

It all started because I wanted ffmpeg instead of avconv, now I just can't stop compiling stuff. I must find another hobby !!\nAnyway, I configure the build process to install to ~/bin, and I add ~/bin to my path.\nMy question is :\nIf I simply delete my binaries from ~/bin, is that the program 'uninstalled' or do you think there might be other stuff installed in other locations too ? Maybe shared stuff ?\n(I know I can go and look but wanted to ask).\n\nA: That depends on the programs you installed and if you used them. Some programs only install some binaries in suitable directories. Other packages also install man or info files, ressource files etc.\nFurthermore as soon as you run programs they may create config files in your home directory or create dconf entries.\nAgain, it highly depends on the source packages you compiled and installed.\n\nA: Rather than weeding out your compiled applications manually consider using the application checkinstall in the first place. When compiling using checkinstall you would use something like the following:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo checkinstall\n\nThis will then give you the option of cleanyly uninstalling your compiled software using the Software Center, Synaptic or dpkg and enabling full integration of your compiled applications with the Ubuntu packaging system.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checkinstall Home Site\n\n*Ubuntu Community Docs\n", "Q: permission denied during installation of Android SDK During installation of android SDK the permission problem appears.

I am trying to write some panel apps for ubuntu Mate. \nI know C/C++, and SDL reasonably well. \nI have seen the Mate-University panel apps github page, but i cannot get it to work properly / Im having a though time with it. \nI am just wondering, if there is some easy avenue to write panel apps? I am not talking about using the custom application launcher, I would like to add new functionality, to the panel, but Im not sure how to.  A tutorial, or description about writing panel apps could be really helpful. \n\nA: Since what seems to be the occasion to ask this question already has an answer, I am answering this question as an extended explanation on how it was done (in python)\nBasic static indicator\nSince Ubuntu Mate, from 15,10, supports indicators, there is not much difference between writing an indicator and a panel app for Mate. Therefore, this link is a good starting point for a basic indicator in python, using the AppIndicator3 API. The link is a nice start, but does not provide any information on how to show text on the indicator, let alone how to update the text (or icon). Nevertheless, with a few additions, this leads to a basic \"frame\" of an indicator as below. It will show an icon, a text label and a menu:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport signal\nimport gi\ngi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0')\ngi.require_version('AppIndicator3', '0.1')\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, AppIndicator3\n\nclass Indicator():\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.app = 'test123'\n        iconpath = \"/opt/abouttime/icon/indicator_icon.png\"\n        self.indicator = AppIndicator3.Indicator.new(\n            self.app, iconpath,\n            AppIndicator3.IndicatorCategory.OTHER)\n        self.indicator.set_status(AppIndicator3.IndicatorStatus.ACTIVE)       \n        self.indicator.set_menu(self.create_menu())\n        self.indicator.set_label(\"1 Monkey\", self.app)\n\n    def create_menu(self):\n        menu = Gtk.Menu()\n        # menu item 1\n        item_1 = Gtk.MenuItem('Menu item')\n        # item_about.connect('activate', self.about)\n        menu.append(item_1)\n        # separator\n        menu_sep = Gtk.SeparatorMenuItem()\n        menu.append(menu_sep)\n        # quit\n        item_quit = Gtk.MenuItem('Quit')\n        item_quit.connect('activate', self.stop)\n        menu.append(item_quit)\n\n        menu.show_all()\n        return menu\n\n    def stop(self, source):\n        Gtk.main_quit()\n\nIndicator()\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_DFL)\nGtk.main()\n\nIn the line AppIndicator3.IndicatorCategory.OTHER, the category is defined, as explaned in this (partially outdated) link. Setting the right category is important, a.o. to put the indicator in an appropriate position in the panel.\nThe main challenge; how to update the indicator text and/or icon\nThe real challenge is not how to write a basic indicator, but how to periodically update the text and/or icon of your indicator, since you want to have it show the (textual) time. To make the indicator work properly, we cannot simply use threading to start a second process to periodically update the interface. Well, actually we can, but on a longer run, it will lead to conflicts, as I found out.\nHere is where GObject comes in, to, as it is put in this (also outdated) link:\ncall gobject.threads_init() at applicaiton initialization. Then you launch your threads normally, but make sure the threads never do any GUI tasks directly. Instead, you use gobject.idle_add to schedule GUI task to executed in the main thread\nWhen we replace gobject.threads_init()  by GObject.threads_init() and gobject.idle_add by GObject.idle_add(), we pretty much have the updated version of how to run threads in a Gtk application. A simplified example, showing an increasing number of Monkeys:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport signal\nimport gi\ngi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0')\ngi.require_version('AppIndicator3', '0.1')\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, AppIndicator3, GObject\nimport time\nfrom threading import Thread\n\nclass Indicator():\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.app = 'test123'\n        iconpath = \"/opt/abouttime/icon/indicator_icon.png\"\n        self.indicator = AppIndicator3.Indicator.new(\n            self.app, iconpath,\n            AppIndicator3.IndicatorCategory.OTHER)\n        self.indicator.set_status(AppIndicator3.IndicatorStatus.ACTIVE)       \n        self.indicator.set_menu(self.create_menu())\n        self.indicator.set_label(\"1 Monkey\", self.app)\n        # the thread:\n        self.update = Thread(target=self.show_seconds)\n        # daemonize the thread to make the indicator stopable\n        self.update.setDaemon(True)\n        self.update.start()\n\n    def create_menu(self):\n        menu = Gtk.Menu()\n        # menu item 1\n        item_1 = Gtk.MenuItem('Menu item')\n        # item_about.connect('activate', self.about)\n        menu.append(item_1)\n        # separator\n        menu_sep = Gtk.SeparatorMenuItem()\n        menu.append(menu_sep)\n        # quit\n        item_quit = Gtk.MenuItem('Quit')\n        item_quit.connect('activate', self.stop)\n        menu.append(item_quit)\n\n        menu.show_all()\n        return menu\n\n    def show_seconds(self):\n        t = 2\n        while True:\n            time.sleep(1)\n            mention = str(t)+\" Monkeys\"\n            # apply the interface update using  GObject.idle_add()\n            GObject.idle_add(\n                self.indicator.set_label,\n                mention, self.app,\n                priority=GObject.PRIORITY_DEFAULT\n                )\n            t += 1\n\n    def stop(self, source):\n        Gtk.main_quit()\n\nIndicator()\n# this is where we call GObject.threads_init()\nGObject.threads_init()\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_DFL)\nGtk.main()\n\n\nThat's the principle. In the actual indicator in this answer, both the loop time and the indicator text were determined by a secondary module, imported in the script, but the main idea is the same.\n", "Q: Is Nvidia GPU works when the load is bigger?

I am trying to mount a RAID array on my computer, and I found a guide on the Internet that told me to add this file to /etc/fstab:\n /dev/md0 /mnt/raid/ext4 defaults 0 0\n\nWhat does /dev/md0 and 0 0 mean in this line?  Or, can you break down and explain the line a little better, explaining what each part of the line is?\n\nA: This looks like an /etc/fstab entry, but it's missing a filesystem type.\nLet's split your line into its relevant parts, and analyze individually.\nMore info on fstab lines can be found in the manpage for fstab. (this link is for Xenial's manpage on fstab)\n\nNote: I believe this line is typoed, and that you really meant to use this line:\n/dev/md0 /mnt/raid/ ext4 defaults 0 0\n\n\nFirst Field: /dev/md0\nThis indicates the block device to mount.  In this case, /dev/md0, which is a special file indicating the device/partition to the system.\n\nSecond field: /mnt/raid/ext4\nThis indicates where on the Linux system this device file is to be mounted.  In this case, in the folder path it specifies.\nGiven the next section, and my quote-box above indicating that I think you've typoed, I believe this should be /mnt/raid.\n\nMissing Third Field: Filesystem Type\nWhen using fstab for mounting things, we always have some type of filesystem declared in the third item.  In your fstab string, this is being skipped, which can cause this to not function right.\nGoing solely by what appears to be a typo in the mount path, and my quote-box above indicating that I believe you typoed, it seems this should be ext4, but I do not know whether this is the case for you.  Determine the filesystem in use on your RAID array, and specify it, adding right before 'defaults' what filesystem to use.\n\nFourth Field: defaults - Mount Options to use.\nBorrowed from my Other Answer on a different question, defaults indicates a default set of mount options:\n\ndefaults - passes default mount options (rw - read/write, suid - allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect, dev - interpret character or block special devices on the filesystem, exec - permit execution of binaries, auto - allows mounting with the -a option of mount, nouser - prohibits a user from mounting, async - permit asynchronous I/O with the filesystem.)\n\n\nFifth field: 0\nThis field is used by dump to determine which filesystems need to be dumped; 0 indicates this is not needed on this filesystem.\n\nSixth field: 0\nThis field is used by fsck to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done at boot time.  A 0 here indicates that the filesystem should not be checked by fsck when an at-boot filesystem check is done.\n\nA: I assume you added this line to /etc/fstab - You can not just add a line there and hope something useful will happen. If it is /etc/fstab you normally find the meaning at the beginning of this very file:\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\nfor more info see manual\nman fstab\nor use google\nYou have a typo in your file: replace [..] /mnt/raid/ext4 [..] with [..] /mnt/raid ext4 [..] ( / with whitespace )\n<file system> device which contains file system\nfirst 0 (fifth field): is used by dump program (man dump)\nsecond 0 (sixth field) is used by fsck at boot time\n", "Q: Need to rescue encrypted hard drive, Ubuntu is not booting I'm having trouble booting my Ubuntu 14.04.

In step 2 \"Getting the software you want\", I have copied the downloaded .TGZ file, and extracted it (it created a separate folder entitled aic7xxx-2.6.  This folder contains 23 files (with extensions .h, .reg, .seq, .c, .h, .h-shipped, .c-shipped, and .reg) and a folder aicasm. Extraction was done by right click on the .tgz and selecting extract here. This is where I need clarification. The instruction says \"If you already installed the packages listed on step 1 (the files are build-essentials and cvs subversion and checkinstall), you just need to change to your /usr/local/src directory and run the commands that are listed\".  My problem is several. (1) There are no commands listed.  What was expected to be run? In step 3 \"Resolving Dependencies, the extracted archive has no file named CONFIGURE. I did install apt-file but without knowing what to search for, I am stuck.  Can someone clue in in on what the next step is after extracting the .TGZ?  Oh yes, is build-essentials a library, no something to be run using the sudo command?\n\nA: I assume you used this tutorial\nYour question (1): look at extracted files - is there an executable or script? Some file with suffix .sh, .py or similar? Is there a file called README, INSTALL or similar which you can open with text editor to get instructions? Is there a file called Makefile? If you answer all questions with NO you might have to compile source the hard way using for example gcc somefile.c -o somefile and execute it using ./somefile\nbuild-essential installs basic packages (libc6-dev | libc-dev, gcc, g++, make, dpkg-dev) to compile c-programs and build .deb packages\nStep 1 in tutorial asks you to install packages using\nsudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall\nBUT I also assume you just want to load aic7xxx kernel module which comes with linux-image-generic (standard kernel) in ubuntu.\nTo check if module is already loaded:\nsudo lsmod | grep aic7xxx\nIf not already loaded load with\nsudo modprobe aic7xxx\n", "Q: How to work around build dependencies with disparate epoch numbers? I have a build on Launchpad that is failing for reasons that escape me.\nThe package clearly lists the build dependencies as:\nMerged Build-Depends: ..., golang (>= 1:1.4~) | gccgo-5, ...\nFiltered Build-Depends: ..., golang (>= 1:1.4~) | gccgo-5, ...\n\nUnless I am missing something, this means either a version of golang >= 1.4 must be installed or gccgo-5 must be installed.\nBut APT does neither of those things. Further down, we see:\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  ... golang-go ...\n0 upgraded, 29 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 26.5 MB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 139 MB of additional disk space will be used.\n...\nGet:27 [...] trusty/universe golang-go i386 2:1.2.1-2ubuntu1 [7148 kB]\n\nHow on earth does golang 1.2 satisfy the build dependency? What's going on here? What am I doing wrong?\n\nEdit: as pointed out in the comments, the problem revolves around the epoch numbers. My question now becomes: what can I do to work around this?\n\nA: Once epoch numbers come into play, you cannot meaningfully request anything other than exact version from an older epoch as a depedency. >= 1:1.4 will be satisfied by any package from a newer epoch, even 2:0.1. You could use exact matches (== 1:1.4), but I doubt that's what you want.\nSince all currently supported versions of Ubuntu have golang packages versioned with the new epoch, it's time you moved to it as well. Debian also uses the new epoch. So, at the moment, it looks like only unofficial sources will even have a 1:-versioned golang package.\n", "Q: Failed to restart isc-dhcp-server.service: Unit isc-dhcp-server.service is masked Basically we follow this guideline to setup dhcp server.

Everything is pretty smooth but for some reason the super key does not work ( checked with xev, it works). I downloaded the unity tweak tool and it doesn't register when I try to change the search to use the super key.\n\nA: I had this same issue with my new XPS13 that came pre-installed with 16.04. Dell has an official support page which explains how to remap the super key to open the dashboard.\n\nHow to enable the Ubuntu super key on Dell OEM Ubuntu installations\nThe Dell OEM Ubuntu operating system allows for the set-up of a Super key, which will function similar to the Windows key or start menu button on the Windows operating system. This article walks you through enabling and configuring the use of this super key on computers with the Dell OEM Ubuntu operating system installed.\nHow to enable the Ubuntu super key\nYou may find that the Super key on the keyboard which is generally used to open the Start Menu on windows machines or the Ubuntu Dash (menu) on Dell OEM Ubuntu installations does not function upon boot. Dell is unable to ship OEM Ubuntu systems with the Super key enabled on non-Windows operating systems.\nThe guide below provides one method to enable the menu button and map its function to open the dash.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open a Terminal (Figure 1):\n\n  \n*Remove the package named dell-super-key with the following command (Figure 2):\nsudo apt-get remove dell-super-key –y\n\nEnter the user password when prompted and confirm the install by pressing y on the keyboard.\n\n  \n*Next install a utility that will map the super key’s function to open the Dash menu by typing in the following command (Figure 3):\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager -y\n\n\n  \n*Remove the input rule that blocks the super key from being mapped with the following command (Figure 4):\nsudo rm –rf /usr/share/gconf/defaults/40_oem-superkey-workaround\n\n\n  \n*Reboot the computer and log in.\n  \n*Open ccsm by searching for it in the Dash the same way we opened the terminal in step 1.\n  \n*In CCSM, also known as Compiz Config Settings Manager, find the Ubuntu Unity Plugin under the Desktop category as shown (Figure 5):\n\n  \n*Next, disable the launcher’s current mapping by following the steps below (Figure 6):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click on the Launcher tab.\n  \n*Click on the button to the right of the first option labeled key to show the dash.\n  \n*On the Edit Key dialogue box, un-check the Enabled setting.\n  \n*Click OK.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n*Finally, to enable the super key’s Dash function, follow the steps below (Figure 7):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click on the button to the right of the first option labeled key to show the dash.\n  \n*Re-check the Enabled setting in the Edit Key dialogue box.\n  \n*Click on the Super button so that it is highlighted green.\n  \n*Confirm the example mapping displayed shows < Super >.\n  \n*Click OK.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n*Now test the super key to see that it opens the Dash Menu.\n\nI'm assuming the process will be the same for 14.04.\n\nA: Dell installs a package dell-super-key that disables this behavior. I did the following to get my super key functioning:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall dell-super-key:\nsudo apt-get remove dell-super-key\n\n\n*Install Compiz Config Settings Manager:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*Set super key as the option to start the launcher\n\n\nA: Before you can configure the setting in compizconfig-settings-manager, you need to enable the 'unityshell' plugin. To do that, go to preferences -> Plugin List and disable 'Automatic plugin sorting'. Then move the 'unityshell' plugin over to the enabled side. Leave preferences and search for unity. The settings are there.\n\nA: There's a scripted way to enable the super key without installing compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo rm -rf /usr/share/gconf/defaults/40_oem-superkey-workaround\nsudo apt-get remove -y dell-super-key\ndconf reset /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/show-launcher\n\n\nA: To launch the compizconfig-settings-manager, you need to run the ccsm command. Then, as said by Matthew, you have first to enable the unityshell in 'Preferences -> Plugin list'. Then set the Super key to start the lancher and disable back the unityshell plugin. Indeed, on my machine, the unityshell plugin was hiding the titles of my windows making things unusable.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 is not in Boot Manager I have a problem with Ubuntu 15.10 \nI have in my computer windows 10. Some days ago i decided to install Ubuntu in partition so i can have both in the same hard drive. The problem is that i cant get into ubuntu, i dont have the grub up so i always go to Windows in default mode. The only way to go into ubuntu is with the CD of installation, when im on the grub of the cd i press Esc, then i text exit in command lines and i go to a boot manager in which i can choose the ubuntu system. Its a strange think because it is the only way i can get into ubuntu, i will like to solve this problem. I try many tutorials already of solving this problem. I didnt get any solution so i will like to ask u before doing another tutorial. Thank u  \n\nA: It looks like your Ubuntu boot loader (GRUB 2) is not properly registered with the firmware. You should be able to fix it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the installer in \"try before installing\" mode.\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install efibootmgr to install the efibootmgr tool.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr -o 0003,2001,0000,2002,2003. This adds your Ubuntu entry (0003) to the start of the boot order, as shown in lines 589-599 of your Boot Repair output.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nThat should fix the problem. Unfortunately, there are some badly broken EFIs that tend to forget their boot orders or ignore anything but Windows boot entries. If you've got such a computer, your best bet is to return it to the store for a refund and get a new computer that's not broken. If that's not possible, Boot Repair has an option on its Advanced menu to back up and rename boot files that might work, but it's an ugly hack of a workaround that might not last all that long, since Windows might easily undo it.\n\nA: All Acers have unique requirements for setting UEFI supervisor password and setting \"trust\" on Ubuntu/grub boot files.

This way grub gets control from BIOS to load the O/S and works accordingly.\ngrub2 is by default installed in recent Ubuntu Linux versions.\n\nA: Run the following command to update grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nIf that doesn't work, change the boot order in your bios and set the windows disk as the first to boot when you want to boot windows. Change the boot order to boot ubuntu in bios when you want to boot ubuntu.\n\nA: I struggled with this for a long time, and tried the other methods that were suggested.  I would somehow get Windows to boot, but then Ubuntu Linux wouldn't boot.  Then I would get Ubuntu to boot, and Windows wouldn't boot.  The solution I found is as follows.  I don't have it in front of me, right now, so this is entirely from memory; YMMV.  Note that my setup uses EFI.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into a live USB or DVD.\n\n*Open a command prompt.\n\n*Type the following:\nsudo blkid\n(Note the device nodes of your Linux boot and system partitions.  It will be something like \"/dev/sdXY\", where \"X\" is a letter, and \"Y\" is a number.)\nsudo mount [Linux system partition] /mnt\nsudo mount [Linux boot partition] /mnt/boot/efi\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /var /mnt/var\nsudo mount --bind /tmp/mnt/tmp\nsudo chroot /mnt\nsudo grub-install [Linux boot partition]\nsudo update-grub\nexit\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Go into EFI BIOS and ensure that it's booting from your Linux hard drive.\nPlease note that GRUB must be installed into the Ubuntu Linux boot partition, when using EFI.  If you install to the drive root (/dev/sdX rather than /dev/sdXY), you'll have problems.\n", "Q: how does java work in ubuntu? Is java the same in ubuntu as with a text editor like note pad? if so do I just write the script and save as java in ubuntu? \nrunning ubuntu server 14 on 32 bit pc no other os running on that pc.\nVery new to all this and would like a little insight! \nthanks\n\nA: Java is cross-platform so you can run same Windows code on Ubuntu. Difference is that if you have a file path specified in the code, you may want to change it. Additionally if you write to a file, remember that text files in Windows end with \\n\\r , while on any *nix it's just \\n. If you have some Windows specific packages you wish to import , that may be an issue. Otherwise , you are 99.9 percent safe\n", "Q: How can I simulate unplugging and plugging in my usb mouse from terminal and bash script?

The specs are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel i7 Processor (2.6 GHz)\n\n*225GB SSD, 25GB Hard drive\n\n*Windows 10\n\n*8GB RAM\n\n\nI want to dual boot a good version of Ubuntu. I had the following questions. \n\n\n*\n\n*Given the specs, will dual booting slow down my computer in any way? \n\n*Any suggestions on the best Ubuntu image to use?\n\n*How much resources on my computer will this use up?\n\n\nA: First of all I suggest you to test Ubuntu 14.04 Long Term Support in a USB live stick.\nIf everything is fine go ahead and install it. If you have minor problem testing it, you can ask here for help or google the problem to solve it. I have installed it with plenty of software and games and it uses right now 10 GB of HD space.\nMaking dual boot the only resource it use is the HDD space. When you boot in windows, Ubuntu doesn't use RAM or anything. The little added time the PC takes is when you have to decide on which OS you want to boot.\n\nA: First of all, are you sure your mechanical drive is only 25GB? Or did you miss a zero?\n\n\n*\n\n*The only negative effect of a dual boot is the space it will take up on the SSD. An extra OS, applications, etc, will take up space on your drive. There is no other performance downside to having a dual boot. When you are running one OS, the other will simply be a dormant part of your SSD. But it won't consume any RAM, CPU or anything like that. Performance wise, it will be exactly like having only one OS, except for the storage thing. Oh, and also maybe the few seconds it takes to choose between Ubuntu and Windows when cold booting the machine.\n\n*That is wholly a matter of taste. However, your hardware is quite decent, so I would advise against lightweight flavors such as Lubuntu. If you have a fair Internet connection, I would advise you to download a few different ones, and try them all from a Live USB (without installing). You can download Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME and Ubuntu MATE, and see which one you like the most. Although don't judge their performance from the USB run, as booting from a USB can often be slower than booting from your SSD. Anyhow, I recommend that you get the 16.04 version of all of them, since that is the current LTS. Make sure to get the 64-bit images rather than the 32-bit.\n\n*When you are running Windows, Ubuntu will not consume any processing power or RAM or anything like that. The same goes for vice versa. When you are running Ubuntu, the system itself requires very little. On a clean installation you should see your CPU at 0-3% and your RAM at maybe 8%, supposing you haven't opened any applications. After that, it's all a matter of what kind of software you run. Some will require a lot of resources, others will require very little.\nI hope this answers your questions.\n", "Q: Pulseaudio on root usermode I need to enable sound on root user mode, I am on Ubuntu 12.04 when I login as root I can see the volume control is disabled, I searched and found that pulse audio wont work on root user mode, but I also found that System-Wide Daemon, so just applied this for root as shown below.   \naddgroup --system pulse\nadduser --system --ingroup pulse --home /var/run/pulse pulse\naddgroup --system pulse-access\n\n# Some distributions restrict access to the sound devices to a group audio\nadduser pulse audio\n\n# Add a user to the pulse-access group\nadduser root pulse-access\n\nBut while reboot still the volume control is disabled.

I have a bunch of virtual Windows machines in VirtualBox If I make a shared folder of the Ubuntu root folder, I will get access to both USB drives, as well as the user folder, etc from the VM's. I also want to have write access from the VM's. But is this dangerous? Or a little bit risky? I usually don't bother to install any antivirus or anything on the VM's. Could a virus on the VM potentially start messing with my Ubuntu system files?\nIs it maybe better to have seperate shared folders? One of the user folder, one of media, etc?\nI'm on Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Usually the purpose of a VM is to isolate a system from the host. If you're sharing the entire file system, I see not much profit in using a VM any more.\n If guest and host OS are the same, just use the host. If they're different, probably a dual-boot setup would be better. \nFrom the security aspect: as soon as you make the host disks or file systems accessible to the guest, malware on the guest can access and infect or destroy it as well.\n", "Q: command not found error when installing android sdk When installing android sdk on Ubuntu, I run the command android sdk as instructed on Installing android page but I get the command not found error.\nSee screenshot below.\n\n\nA: It says \"Open a terminal and navigate to the tools/ directory in the location where the Android SDK was installed, then execute android sdk.\" So you have to run it via shell.

That is, can I also expect my BASH scripts to run?\n\n\nA: Here's a list of some of the prominent programs that are expected to have native support for touch:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/tablet/features\nThe input in Ubuntu Touch (15) is enabled by a mix of QT5 for the touch bit and Maliit for the virtual keyboard.  Telephony(cellular) is enabled is inherited via pieces contributed by Nokia to the Maemo and Meego projects.\nBasically any app that runs on Linux should be supported... however their desktop GUI may not work well with input stack.\nUbuntu Touch tablets do support microUSB keyboards and microHDMI output to large monitors, turning your tablet into a desktop, though.  This way you can still use programs whose GUIs are well suited for touch at the present.\nAs it is Linux and has no manufacturer restrictions against the device owner's permissions (jailbroken Android), you can certainly run and install apps in the terminal -- even ones that require root.\nBASH scripts will assuredly run, as well!\nThere's currently no Ubuntu Touch tablets on the market, but that will soonc change, as your comment suggests you may know.  The Aquarius Touch 10 by BQ is currently in preorder... it's somewhat pricey, but I guess that's the price you pay for early adoption:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2016/03/aquaris-m10-ubuntu-edition-tablet.html\nIt ships (supposedly) the second week in April.

It asks the apt server to provide un-cached files. This can be useful if there are any kind of (broken) caching mechanism between your machine and apt mirror/server.

I Know, the ubuntu desktop can easily stream netflix using chrome, but as far as I know, chrome is not an option on ubuntu touch.\nthank you in advance!\n\nA: As of 2016-06-13, the only mean to watch Netflix on Linux is through Chrome.  If Chrome is not available in your distribution, you cannot watch Netflix.  Since Chrome is not available for Linux ARM, you cannot watch Netflix on any ARM devices, including pretty much all devices Ubuntu Touch is actively worked on.  Note that one can get a Ubuntu Touch image for x86 systems here.\nChrome comes with the Widevine extension which Netflix use.  This extension complies with Encrypted Media Extensions.  Google acquired the technology on December 3, 2010 by buying Widevine Technologies inc.\nThere was a campaign on Indiegogo named World's First True made for Linux/Ubuntu x86/x64 Tablet where an Intel tablet is proposed.  Since it was Intel based, Chrome should have worked on it.  But alas, the campaign failed to raise the money.  \n\nA: Actually, Netflix says that Firefox 42 or later should also work, but I assume that it's only on the desktop.

See if it's doing what you want and then remove the echo and run it again.\nSample output on my machine:\n$ tree\n.\n├── folder_1\n│   ├── subfolder_1\n│   │   └── file_25406\n│   ├── subfolder_10\n│   │   └── file_1439\n│   ├── subfolder_11\n│   │   └── file_21028\n│   ├── subfolder_12\n│   │   └── file_13026\n│   ├── subfolder_13\n│   │   └── file_3717\n│   ├── subfolder_14\n│   │   └── file_9825\n│   ├── subfolder_15\n│   │   └── file_14953\n│   ├── subfolder_16\n│   │   └── file_12760\n│   ├── subfolder_17\n│   │   └── file_8490\n│   ├── subfolder_18\n│   │   └── file_14577\n│   ├── subfolder_19\n│   │   └── file_11999\n│   ├── subfolder_2\n│   │   └── file_24557\n│   ├── subfolder_20\n│   │   └── file_27957\n│   ├── subfolder_21\n│   │   └── file_158\n│   ├── subfolder_22\n│   │   └── file_1361\n│   ├── subfolder_23\n│   │   └── file_27370\n│   ├── subfolder_24\n│   │   └── file_4919\n│   ├── subfolder_3\n│   │   └── file_30149\n│   ├── subfolder_4\n│   │   └── file_5352\n│   ├── subfolder_5\n│   │   └── file_27907\n│   ├── subfolder_6\n│   │   └── file_14716\n│   ├── subfolder_7\n│   │   └── file_1989\n│   ├── subfolder_8\n│   │   └── file_7850\n│   └── subfolder_9\n│       └── file_31831\n├── folder_2\n│   ├── subfolder_1\n│   ├── subfolder_10\n│   ├── subfolder_11\n│   ├── subfolder_12\n│   ├── subfolder_13\n│   ├── subfolder_14\n│   ├── subfolder_15\n│   ├── subfolder_16\n│   ├── subfolder_17\n│   ├── subfolder_18\n│   ├── subfolder_19\n│   ├── subfolder_2\n│   ├── subfolder_20\n│   ├── subfolder_21\n│   ├── subfolder_22\n│   ├── subfolder_23\n│   ├── subfolder_24\n│   ├── subfolder_3\n│   ├── subfolder_4\n│   ├── subfolder_5\n│   ├── subfolder_6\n│   ├── subfolder_7\n│   ├── subfolder_8\n│   └── subfolder_9\n└── script.sh\n\n50 directories, 25 files\n$ find folder_1 -type f -name 'file_*' -print0 | while read -d '' -r file; do cp \"$file\" folder_2/\"${file#*/}\"; done\n$ tree\n.\n├── folder_1\n│   ├── subfolder_1\n│   │   └── file_25406\n│   ├── subfolder_10\n│   │   └── file_1439\n│   ├── subfolder_11\n│   │   └── file_21028\n│   ├── subfolder_12\n│   │   └── file_13026\n│   ├── subfolder_13\n│   │   └── file_3717\n│   ├── subfolder_14\n│   │   └── file_9825\n│   ├── subfolder_15\n│   │   └── file_14953\n│   ├── subfolder_16\n│   │   └── file_12760\n│   ├── subfolder_17\n│   │   └── file_8490\n│   ├── subfolder_18\n│   │   └── file_14577\n│   ├── subfolder_19\n│   │   └── file_11999\n│   ├── subfolder_2\n│   │   └── file_24557\n│   ├── subfolder_20\n│   │   └── file_27957\n│   ├── subfolder_21\n│   │   └── file_158\n│   ├── subfolder_22\n│   │   └── file_1361\n│   ├── subfolder_23\n│   │   └── file_27370\n│   ├── subfolder_24\n│   │   └── file_4919\n│   ├── subfolder_3\n│   │   └── file_30149\n│   ├── subfolder_4\n│   │   └── file_5352\n│   ├── subfolder_5\n│   │   └── file_27907\n│   ├── subfolder_6\n│   │   └── file_14716\n│   ├── subfolder_7\n│   │   └── file_1989\n│   ├── subfolder_8\n│   │   └── file_7850\n│   └── subfolder_9\n│       └── file_31831\n├── folder_2\n│   ├── subfolder_1\n│   │   └── file_25406\n│   ├── subfolder_10\n│   │   └── file_1439\n│   ├── subfolder_11\n│   │   └── file_21028\n│   ├── subfolder_12\n│   │   └── file_13026\n│   ├── subfolder_13\n│   │   └── file_3717\n│   ├── subfolder_14\n│   │   └── file_9825\n│   ├── subfolder_15\n│   │   └── file_14953\n│   ├── subfolder_16\n│   │   └── file_12760\n│   ├── subfolder_17\n│   │   └── file_8490\n│   ├── subfolder_18\n│   │   └── file_14577\n│   ├── subfolder_19\n│   │   └── file_11999\n│   ├── subfolder_2\n│   │   └── file_24557\n│   ├── subfolder_20\n│   │   └── file_27957\n│   ├── subfolder_21\n│   │   └── file_158\n│   ├── subfolder_22\n│   │   └── file_1361\n│   ├── subfolder_23\n│   │   └── file_27370\n│   ├── subfolder_24\n│   │   └── file_4919\n│   ├── subfolder_3\n│   │   └── file_30149\n│   ├── subfolder_4\n│   │   └── file_5352\n│   ├── subfolder_5\n│   │   └── file_27907\n│   ├── subfolder_6\n│   │   └── file_14716\n│   ├── subfolder_7\n│   │   └── file_1989\n│   ├── subfolder_8\n│   │   └── file_7850\n│   └── subfolder_9\n│       └── file_31831\n└── script.sh\n\n50 directories, 49 files\n$ \n\n", "Q: 16.04 Gnome Software PPA applications With the new Gnome Software replacing Ubuntu Software Center, will I still be able to add PPAs and have those app show up in Gnome Software?\n\nA: Yes and no. It depends on each app in particular. Y-ppa-manager shows correctly in GSC. Wine does not. I have currently Wine 1.8 installed, but GSC shows only Wine 1.6 available... to install. OpenJDK 9 comes preinstalled, and yet GSC won't recognize it, no listing of any version AT ALL. WPS Office shows correctly in GSC, but will not provide updates because there is no ppa for it. Make sure you always use the correct ppa! It should work. Most of the times.\n", "Q: can't login as super user.

When enter sudo su -  it ask for ( sudo)  password after giving the password it shows   \"cannot execute exit: no such file or directory\".  What should I do plzzz it important so help me.\n\nA: I guess your shell for root is set incorrectly. Please run the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/passwd\n\nLook for a line containing root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash. Does it look different in your case?

(like \"open\").\nWhat may have been broken by this foolish action, and if so how can I fix the possible damage?\n\nA: I don't believe you have broken anything. Who cares if the files is not displayed. You have found a good way to hide a file. :)\nOtherwise hidden file names are the ones with the dot at the beginning (for instance .bashrc).\nYou can just delete the file with rm ./\\\\.sh and there will be no trace of your little experiment.\n", "Q: 3 monitors using built in graphics & Nvidia card I am struggling with this.  I have tried multiple things that I have found on the net with no luck.  I have built in Intel graphics on my motherboard.  I have DVI/VGA/HDMI ports on my motherboard.  I have configured BIOS to allow both of them to work.  I have had this working just fine on Windows 7 & Windows 10 here at work.  I have decided that I want to get away from Windows on my desktop PC here at work and switch over to linux.  For anything needed with Windows, I would have a VM for that.\nAnyway, I have a Nvidia graphics card and for the life of me, I am unable to get this working.  If you use the factory generic driver, and go to the display settings, you see all 3 monitors, but only the 2 on the Nvidia card will actually work.  It is very jumpy, mouse pointer hides when moving...etc.  If you install any of the open source Nvidia drivers then it gets rid of the jumpiness and the mouse pointer from hiding.  If you go to the display properties in the nvidia panel application then it doesn't see the monitor after you pick the nvidia driver....nor does it in the normal display properties in ubuntu. \nI have a mini hdmi out port on my graphics card with the 2 dvi's....I figured I would be smart and run all 3 monitors off of one card...no, that doesn't work either....it shows the monitor but it will not enable it in the nvidia app....\nThis is so frustrating.\n\nA: I have identical configuration. I had to set some things in BIOS exactly as you said to have three monitors. With NVIDIA there was no way for me to setup three monitors working. I gave up and I am using open source NVIDIA driver - nouveau with intel driver for the onboard adapter. It seemed to me as NVIDIA priprietary driver will not cowork with any other driver.\nI also had problems not showing the picture on monitor connected to Intel onboard adapter. I changed some BIOS settings and then the picture on the third monitor appeared. Unfortunately, I don't remember the BIOS setting and I don't have the access to that computer right now. I can check tommorow when I get to that computer, but I don't think I will remember, which BIOS setting it was.\n", "Q: Warning on startup about disk partition which has been deleted While setting up a dual boot on my previously Ubuntu-only system I deleted one of Ubuntu's partitions, which was being mounted during boot.

This driver is therefore called a \"net filter\" driver. This allows VirtualBox to intercept data from the physical network and inject data into it, effectively creating a new network interface in software. When a guest is using such a new software interface, it looks to the host system as though the guest were physically connected to the interface using a network cable: the host can send data to the guest through that interface and receive data from it. This means that you can set up routing or bridging between the guest and the rest of your network.\n\n", "Q: Why is apt downloading package list again when updating in 16.04?

As said, if there is a lot of moving\\changing objects (letters, video, diagrams etc) that should be displayed through USB adapter this is not a solution in case of more than one display.\n\n*Matrox TrippleHead2Go DP edition will relay on your hardware (video adapter) and will not cost you anything in terms of performance (thus it will heat up some chips). As said if your internal video processor is able to handle needed resolution (do not forget of notebook's own display) you will be ok.\n\n*There are tow ways of slightly other approach:\n3.a Use external video card connected by DisplayLink\n3.b Use external video card connected by PCI-express\nI will not go through both of those ways as it is out of scope for this question.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Login Loop and LibGL error After installing a Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 graphics card I tried to install Nvidia's proprietary drivers via the \"Additional drivers\" dialogue.\nAfter rebooting the computer the login screen appeared but I was not able to login.

I would like to determine whether a re-encode will be successful without attempting the encode and then examining the output. Ideally I'd like to do this in a bash script. My skills are somewhat limited in this regard and much of what I have come up with thus far is far less than elegant.\nFor example I know that I can do the math with bc as in:\n echo 'scale=2;576/8' | bc\n72.00\n\nand I can obtain the width via\nwidth=$(mediainfo $filename | grep \"Width\" | sed 's/[^0-9]*//g')\n\nbut the former doesn't exactly answer the question is the width divisible by 8 and the latter is ugly and uses too many pipes which research indicates is less then efficient. \nI've got the ffmpeg command line for re-encoding sorted to my satisfaction using:\nffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c:a copy -c:v libx265 -preset \"$preset\" -crf 25 \"$target\" \nand I intend to scale the video to a width divisible by 8 if it isn't already but I'm looking for better solutions than I've come up with thus far for determining if scaling is required and how to determine the closest width divisible by 8 to scale to.\n\nA: The following will correct the width to a number divisible by 8 and then correctly rescale the height to a number divisible by 8 while maintaining correct aspect ratio:\nffmpeg -i <input> \\\n       -c:a copy \\\n       -c:v libx265 -preset medium -x265-params crf=28 \\\n       -vf scale=\"trunc(iw/8)*8:-8\" \\\n       <output>\n\nAs a bonus if the width is already divisible by 8 there will be no change in the output width and no error from FFmpeg.\nAn explanation for the scale syntax, remembering that the syntax is -vf scale=width:height:\n1. Output Width Calculation:\n\n\n*\n\n*iw/8: The width of the input video stream will be divided by 8. So an original width of 690 would create a number 86.25\n\n*trunc: The number 86.25 would be 'truncated' to 86\n\n**8: 86 would be multiplied by 8 to give a final width of 688 which of course is divisible by 8!\n\n\n2. Output Height Calculation:\n\n\n*\n\n*-8: FFmpeg will calculate a height that is divisible by 8 but which also maintains the correct aspect ratio of the original file\n\n\nIn a perfect world hevc encoding is run with encoding units of 8x8, 16x16, 32x32 etc and this syntax guarantees this. More details of this here...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*FFmpeg and H.265 Encoding Guide\n\n*Scaling (resizing) with ffmpeg\n\n*FFmpeg: 3. Expression Evaluation\n\n*HEVC – What are CTU, CU, CTB, CB, PB, and TB?\n\nA: Obtaining the width is relatively simple with mediainfo. If you don't have it you can install it with sudo apt-get install mediainfo\nwidth=$(mediainfo '--Inform=Video;%Width%' $filename)\nDetermining divisibility by 8 can be done via\nif [ $(( $width % 8 )) -eq 0 ] ; then\n   echo \"Your number is divisible by 8 – you may convert it”\nelse\n   echo \"Video width is not divisible by 8 – it needs scaling to re-encode it.\"\nfi\n\nA far simpler and faster approach inspired by @andrew.46 and a bit more research and testing is to let ffmpeg do the work with\nffmpeg -i $inputfilename -c:a copy -c:v libx265 -preset veryfast -x265-params crf=25 -vf scale=-8:ih $outputfilename\nthe -vf scale=-8:ih setting insures that the width is divisible by 8 (-8) and uses the input height (ih) accordingly to maintain aspect ratio. \nSources: man mediainfo\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7376477/geting-video-information-from-mediainfo\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/49765/how-to-make-a-statement-that-checks-if-something-is-divisible-by-something-else\nHow can I determine if a video can be encoded successfully with HEVC (x265) encoding\nhttp://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#scale\n", "Q: What blobs are in the Ubuntu kernel, release 15.10? It was indicated that my question was a lot like the question following this, the edit suggested explaining why it is different. This is about the kernel, not about repositories. Refer to the following question and see the difference: Which repository are free software on 12.04\nAdditonally, I am not asking HOW to install a blob free kernel. I am asking for a solid answer about which are in it. The vanilla kernel includes blobs. If you are telling me there are none, please point to your sources so I can check them out. I am NOT criticizing Ubuntu, just looking for interesting information. Opinions are not interesting. Facts would help me. \nI see in one reply that there are NO BLOBs in the kernel Ubuntu included. However, the vanilla kernel does have blobs. Is the Ubuntu kernel a different build? In 2013 it did: Does Ubuntu contain Non-free kernel blobs and other non-free system components?\nI have read in the answer to the above question that the option of not including proprietary software is available when Ubuntu is installed. I have seen the option for not installing some mpeg decoding stuff, but have seen nothing about installing a blob-free kernel.\nSO, assuming the kernel has blobs in it, regardless of the options we choose (and I'm neutral about the question of whether that's a good thing or not) I would really like to know what blobs are in there.\nIF I am mistaken, THEN my question is this: Does Ubuntu have a separate builds, with no blobs in one and one with blobs? ELSE are the blobs contained in loadable modules?\n\nA: Ubuntu kernels do not contain any blobs.\nWhen you install Ubuntu the default is not to install any proprietary packages.\nSo the answer is: If you do not enable proprietary packages or do not install any proprietary drivers afterwards, you get a blob free installation.\nThere is an exception, but it is not in kernel. The linux-firmware package. It contains hardware firmware, that is set of blobs and it is installed by default. But this code is not supposed to be executed by CPU and can't be considered as \"blobs\" in the common meaning.\n\nA: [Info from reddit][1]As for what I meant by \"blob,\" this link explains it clearly. I need no opinions - Wikipedia explained it clearly enough for me.\nI read that Debian \"deblobs\" their kernel and that Ubuntu is built around the Debian distro. So I looked further and found this: [1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/3ndgx0/how_to_deblob_vanilla_kernel/\nSo, now at least I have a working understanding of what a 'blob' is, I know where to find more information, and I've learned to do the research myself because otherwise I'll drown under a sea of opinions. I wonder if ANY QUESTION can be on topic in this forum, since everything is subject to off-the-cuff opinions. If you don't like the heat get out of the kitchen, as they say, so thank you, and adios. I'd hoped for more but learned I must stand on my own.

Configuring your 3G dongle to connect to a WiFi network, in many cases, requires the use of the official software that came with the dongle. \nThis software, again, in many cases, works only on Windows. You may install the dongle software in Ubuntu via Wine, but I do not see everything working as normal.\nIt is therefore, through the software interface, that you can manipulate settings, such as connecting to a WiFi network, or even configuring the use of the dongle SD Card slot.\nYou may run the software in a virtual Windows environment to see the settings of the dongle software if it supports connecting to WiFi and if there're configuration options for that.\n", "Q: Changing enter and tab I would like to make enter key act as tab and tab key act as enter in my keyboard, and also backspace to (`) and shift-backspace to (~).\nI would also like to change Left, Down, Up and Right to F1, F2, F3, F4.\n\nA: There are two built-in command that you can use: xev and xmodmap.\nBoth command line applications are available by default, so there is no need to install additional software.\nXev \"creates a window and then asks the X server to send it events whenever anything happens to the window (such as it being moved, resized, typed in, clicked in, etc.).\" xev man page\nxmodmap is a \"program is used to edit and display the keyboard modifier map and keymap table that are used by client applications to convert event keycodes into keysyms.\" xmodmap man page\nAnd Also there are some applications that do this for you. One of them is xbindkeys\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n\nXbindkeys is a very versatile program that lets you remap keys very easily. It uses a config file, my default located in your home directory, to change key bindings into certain commands.\nFor more information please go to this site.\n", "Q: What's the simplest way of creating a Virtual Machine from a Physical Ubuntu Server? I have full access to the server, although I normally use it via SSH.\nI would like to have a backup of this server because it has too many configurations and running programs, crons, etc. that I wouldn't like to have to reinstall again.\nI have tried running vmware converter from my windows computer. It asks for my Ubuntu Login information, but then in the second screen it asks for VMware infrastructure which I don't have nor know what it is.\nI normally use VirtualBox for my virtual machines, not vmware. But I'm open to solutions.\nI would also be happy with an ISO (or similar) image from my ubuntu server too. Whatever is easier to restore would be great.\n\nA: From what I understand from your question, my advice would be to clone the drive on a regular schedule, not use virtualisation. Though I have never tested it, you can apparently do what you are asking with VM Ware :\nI see you have had issues with that, I had a quick look at the manual and it's not very helpful. There are VM Ware forums where you may get a lead on the actual message it's giving you.\nI believe you can also create a VM from Parallels, but you would have to load it up on a MAC host.\n", "Q: Install full Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS in a 64Gb USB 3.0 drive with NTFS side partition for windows compatibility I want to partition a 64Gb USB 3.0 drive to have a full ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS installation in one 48Gb ext2 partition and a common NTFS partition with 16Gb to be accessed by windows and ubuntu without needing to boot from it. Is this possible? Because I am having a lot of trouble getting it to work.\nI am at a point where I can successfully install ubuntu in the first partition, format the second one also in ext2, boot into a second ubuntu installation and reformat the second partition of the first USB drive in NTFS using GParted. The NTFS partition is seen by ubuntu and the drive boots, but the problem is that windows cannot see it. Do you have some clues of why this happens or what I may be doing wrong? Windows only sees the main partition and naturally cannot access it as it is not FAT32 or NTFS.\nAnother thing: I want to use NTFS and not FAT32 because I want to be able to transfer files in that partition that are larger than 4Gb.\nI have been searching for a couple of days and I would like to give insight of what I understood and have been following:\n\n\n*\n\n*A full Ubuntu installation is faster to boot than a live one and allows easy \"persistence\" over 4Gb without fidgeting with casper-rw labelled partitions that I couldn't get to work properly (maybe my fault, maybe the hardware's)\n\n*For a full Ubuntu installation in a USB thumbdrive we have to use a live installation using a Live CD or a second USB drive and choose \"Install Ubuntu\" at the first screen to proceed to the installation in the first USB drive.\n\n*A swap partition isn't needed in systems that have enough RAM for the applications they run (my case, my desktop has 4Gb RAM, my laptop 16Gb).\n\n*At the install screen, we should choose the entire drive instead of the boot partition for the location of the bootloader, otherwise bad stuff may happen (I didn't understand why that may be).\n\n*It is better to replace the usual ext4 partitions with ext2, as this type of partition doesn't use a journaling system. If I understood correctly, that is because unlike a hard disk drive, a solid state drive has access times that do not depend on physical data location, so in this case it doesn't need a journaling system.\n\nA: I found the problem!!\nI was partitioning (logically in my opinion) with the first partition in the USB drive as ext2 and the second one as NTFS. Turns out... windows doesn't deal well with this. \nWINDOWS ONLY DETECTS THE FIRST PARTITION!!!

Update: It turns out, our in-house network suppresses pings. I demonstrated this by turning my phone into a hot-spot (thus changing my outbound gateway), connecting with a laptop, then pinging the servers, which worked as expected. ::pulls  hair out::\n\nI've inherited two Ubuntu servers that seem to be configured to reject PING requests. My goal is to re-enable pinging for diagnostic purposes.\nThings I've tried to enable pinging:\nBased on instructions from here, I executed this command:\necho  0  > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all\n\nThen added the following instruction to /etc/sysctl.conf so it's enabled on boo. This instruction was not already present:\nnet.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=0\n\n\nufw\nRespecting ufw, I followed the steps noted in this SO thread: In the file /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf, I found this rule. I did not have to add it.\nnet/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all=0\n\nI also added rules to /etc/ufw/before.rules\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nand /etc/ufw/before6.rules\n-A ufw6-before-input -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type echo-request -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nThen restarted that service. service ufw restart\n\niptables\nI added some iptables entries I found by Googling. (I'm showing only the relevant rules in the list.)\nroot@tatooine:~# iptables --list\nACCEPT     icmp --  anywhere             maskedpath.linode.com icmp echo-request state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED\nACCEPT     icmp --  anywhere             anywhere            state NEW icmp echo-request\n\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nACCEPT     icmp --  maskedpath.linode.com  anywhere            icmp echo-reply state RELATED,ESTABLISHED\n\n\nSo my question is: In order to enable pinging, are there additional configurations I am not checking? Alternately, could the ufw rules be loading from a different file? (And if so how can I find that file?) \nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nA: Hops (Firewalls) along the route could filter icmp packets in between ping source and ping destination.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use mtr / traceroute instead of ping (or Ping next hop then after next hop...)\n\n*Ping different destination and see if this works\n\n*Ping from different source network\n\n", "Q: How to mount a virtual hard drive to an existing virtual image? I need help expanding my hard drive.\nI created a virtual image to run Ubuntu on an Oracle VM (fixed 8Gbs). I have since created a second virtual hard drive that will expand as needed. I want to install more software and allow the second hard drive take some of the load. My problem is in the mounting I believe. (i am new to linux)\nThus far i have partitioned the second drive and mounted it to /media/mynewdrive\nBut it just sits there. I need to move some programs over to the second drive. How do I do that?\n\nA: I know the command line way much better - so here we go using command line and your favourite text editor only:\nOpen up the terminal of your choice (ex. gnome-terminal) and check where your data sits\nsudo du -xh --max-depth=1 /\nFor simplicity I recommend to mount the new partition under a first level directory.\nThink about which data you want to put on the new partition. Common choices are /home if you have lots of Movies/Fotos/VirtualDiskImages/... :), or /usr if you want to install more software from your distribution, /var if you run a for example a mail server, /opt if you use lots of third party software there / ...\nBe sure you formatted your partition with a linux file system (I recommend ext4).\nYou can check this typing mount which gives you all mounted file systems including file system and mount options you may want to copy and paste later to /etc/fstab\nThe format is:\n<file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>\nSo first we copy a hole first level folder to the new partition and configure /etc/fstab (file system table) and test if everything is done right. Then we remove the data from old partition. I assume you want to move /home Partition so replace this if you choose other.\nsudo cp -aT /home /media/mynewdrive\nIf mynewdrive was empty /home and /media/mynewdrive contain the same data. Probably there is an additional lost+found folder in mynewdrive which was created during formatting which you can ignore.\nNow add a line to /etc/fstab using <youreditor>. Replace this with for example with gedit.\nsudo <youreditor> /etc/fstab\nThe line you add will look like this\n<file system> /home   <type>  <options> 0 2\nYou have to replace <options> simply with defaults or with options you got from mount but without brackets and don't use noauto cause this prevents from mounting automatically while system boot. Be sure to have spaces and/or tabs between entries and commas (and no spaces or tabs) between options. Save and close.\nNow you check if everything worked an you can mount the new partition to the right folder:\nsudo mount /home\nIt worked if you get no output. Then you can see it using again mount. Check if your data are in place:\nsudo du -hs /home should show the same size as on first run above.\nNow remove the original data on root partition:\nsudo umount /home\nOnly do next step if everything went fine until here and you checked new partition is not mounted at /home:\nsudo rm -r /home && sudo mkdir /home\nnow you can mount it again:\nsudo mount /home\nand umount from /media\nsudo umount /media/mynewdrive (which you could have done at any point ;) )\nAnd always do final test: reboot\n", "Q: How to add accents etc to letters using the \"English (UK)\" input source? How can I use the \"English (UK)\" input source on Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18 to add accents etc to letters?\n\nA: If you look at the UK keyboard layout chart:\n\nyou'll see a ton of tertiary and quaternary symbols per key.\nThese are used with the Right Alt for the tertiary and Right Alt+Shift for the quaternary ones, so Right Alt+Shift+M will give you °, so you can now write: -40°C = -40°F \n\nA: In addition to @Fabby's answer, don't forget about the Compose key Shift+AltGr.\nThe keys must be pressed in that order, as AltGr+Shift gives the dead-key, as described by Fabby.\nFor example, Shift+AltGr, o, o gives you °. (Note that you press Shift and then AltGr at the same time, then let go of both keys before pressing o, and o again.)\nMore examples that can be obtained with Shift+AltGr:\n\n\n*\n\n*é: e, '\n\n*ç: c, ,\n\n*ö: o, \"\n\n*ß: s, s\n\n*½: 1, 2\n\n*→: -, >\n\n*— (em-dash): -, -, -\nRefer to /usr/share/X11/locale/${LANG}/Compose for a full list. (If the file doesn't exist, use your closest ${LANG}. For example, my ${LANG} is en_GB.UTF-8, but the nearest file for me is /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose.)\n\nA: Some suddenly misconfiguration maked me write spanish tildes like \"´a\". You didn't tell your keyboard layout.\nMy .xinputrc was old. I solved only excecuting:\nim-config\n\nAnd I followed choosing 'default'. \nIf your layout is not in your target accents-language you can write some symbols and all characters with an easy app gucharmap (I have it in Xubuntu, maybe in ubuntu works as well)\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 email notification does not work I use Ubuntu 14.04 and have a Gmail account and I would like get notifications about incoming emails.\nI have installed Unity Mail.

I have successfully installed deja-dup and duplicity.  What I am trying to do is to verify that the scsi controller and LTO drive are being recognized by Ubuntu. Question: Deja-dup does locate any devices, only folders/drives (there are two hard drives). Is duplicity/deja-dup only for use with folders/directories? If they are, is there a list of Ubuntu supported back-up software that is newer than 2014 (Comparison of backup tools) that Ubuntu supports somewhere? I ask because I know that as software develops, what works in 2014 may not be supported in 2016.\n\nA: This is a two step process. First, you need identify the the Dell LTO scsi tape drive as recognized by the computer. Second, you need to mount the device as a folder/directory.\nFirst Step: Find the device\nTo list all the scsi devices, you need a tool called lssci. You may need to install this first. Open a command line by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter:\nsudo apt-get install lsscsi\n\nEnter your password when prompted. The cursor won't move while you enter your password. That is normal. Once lsscsi is installed, enter the command:\nlsscsi -l\n\nThis will list your SCSI devices like the DELL LTO. It will look something like /dev/st0. /dev is a special virtual folder for devices in Linux. The devices listed there needs to be mounted on a regular folder before they can be used by any program like Deja Dup.\nSecond Step: Mount the device\nUbuntu mounts devices that are not always connected under the folder /media/. First, see if the device is already mounted there or not. It will be something like /media/Dell_LTO. If this is so, we are almost done. If not, you need to first create the Dell_LTO folder under /media/ by the following command:\nsudo  mkdir /media/DELL_LTO\n\nYou will need to do this once only. Once the actual folder is created, you will have to tell the computer to use that folder as the mount point for the Dell LTO devise.\nsudo mount /dev/st0 /media/DELL_LTO\n\nHere I have used DELL_LTO as an example. You can call this folder whatever you want. Remember Linux is case sensitive. So a folder call DELL_LTO is very different from a another folder called dell_lto, or dEll_lTo.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Ubuntu cannot pair with bluetooth keyboard Ubuntu 15.10 cannot pair with bluetooth keyboard. \nIn the GUI, it says \"setting up '....keyboard' failed.\nIf using the bluetoothctl, the error message shows 'Failed to pair: org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationCanceled'\n[NEW] Controller 00:1A:7D:DA:71:13 odin-desktop [default]\n[NEW] Device 00:18:00:3B:C1:B2 FILCO Bluetooth Keyboard\n[bluetooth]# pair 00:18:00:3B:C1:B2 \nAttempting to pair with 00:18:00:3B:C1:B2\nFailed to pair: org.bluez.Error.InProgress\n[CHG] Device 00:18:00:3B:C1:B2 Connected: no\n[bluetooth]# pair 00:18:00:3B:C1:B2 \nAttempting to pair with 00:18:00:3B:C1:B2\n[CHG] Device 00:18:00:3B:C1:B2 Connected: yes\n[CHG] Device 00:18:00:3B:C1:B2 Connected: no\n[CHG] Device 00:18:00:3B:C1:B2 Connected: yes\nFailed to pair: org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationCanceled\n[CHG] Device 00:18:00:3B:C1:B2 Connected: no\n\nI tried according to https://communities.intel.com/thread/62848?start=0&tstart=0\nand https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=197469&p=2\nThose do not help.\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nA: Apparently, some time in 2008, bluez had a major overhaul, but the development team forgot to create any documentation on how to use the new version.\nAccording to this site, where you can find many more details on what happened and why,\n\nThe developers of bluez, once the nice Bluetooth package everyone could live with, decided it was time for a major overhaul: they merged the packages bluez-libs and bluez-utils and then some. And with ‘and then some’ meaning completely changing the way Bluetooth devices are configured and thereby breaking backwards compatibility.\n\nAn update on this article confirms that the same problem exists in 2016. No one knows how to use the new bluez.\nHowever, there are a few workarounds. The author of that article has created a workaround that may or may not work for you, especially since it is for Ubuntu 9.04. You can try your luck though, here: http://www.bennybottema.com/2010/01/28/how-to-connect-a-bluetooth-keyboard-in-ubuntu-9-04-jaunty-and-9-10-karmic-workaround/\nUnfortunately, it seems like there is no known fix for this. No one can seem to find anything out about bluez. From what I've researched on this, there is still no documentation available, nor any answers to the keyboard pairing problem, which seems to be fairly common. I think your best best it to try the workaround I linked and see if it works.\n", "Q: How to import LXC containers from a previously used ZFS lxc zpool?

Hi there I seem to have a serious problem that google wasn't able to help me with. I'm a novice with GNU systems. I was clearing up some space on my boot folder (which of course what I think went wrong) because the memory was full for more updates. I followed some instructions I found on the web and everything was working fine. I have another hard-disk with Win10 that I use to game on. After the reset, I tried to return to Ubuntu when I came to the GNU GRUB menu as always and behold there is no more Ubuntu option. \nThis stinks. What should I try?\n\nA: /boot contains bootloader, kernel and other images, what will boot. If you deleted some files, you can fall in to grub rescue, or something like that.

In fact, it seems pretty specific to your model.\nThese laptops have something special built into the firmware that verifies EFI boot files, and makes sure they are valid and not dangerous. This works fine with Windows, but the problem arises when you install Linux.\nSomeone discovered a vulnerability in this protection script:\n\nCertain firmware implementations may not correctly protect memory that stores the BIOS S3 Boot Script when a system is suspended.  Exploitation of such vulnerabilities could potentially lead to bypass security features and/or denial of service the platform.\n\nYour laptop is on the affected list. If you installed this BIOS update, then it might be the reason for your problem. That is meant to be the fix for the vulnerability, and it seems to cause issues with Linux.\nSupposedly, the problem occurs only when waking from suspend, and unfortunately, there seems to be no fix. Your best option is to just avoid sleep mode, or reinstall Windows and have a dual-boot. You could modify the BIOS firmware ad re-flash, but I doubt you want to do that.\nMore details:\nhttps://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=212044\n\nA: I think it's an unproven assumption that this is specific to some Lenovo devices: https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=212044\n\nPostby syeager » Mon Jun 13, 2016 2:27 am\nI have been installing different linux distros on my HP Envy and all\n  have the same problem: sleep once, fine; sleep again, and it will not\n  recover with a black screen, where upon on reboot (the only option\n  with a hardware reboot) i get the error message 'boot script table\n  modified'.

If I keep the default of GUID (GPT) now together with exFAT, I get the exact same behaviour on my Ubuntu 16.04LTS as you describe.

I have tried changing the categories from the drop down in software center but still no luck.\ndpkg shows me that the software is installed. apt-get also lists the software. But it is not visible in Software Center.\nI have tried this in various ubuntu versions on 32 bit as well as 64 bit. The problem seems to be intermittent. Any pointers/help to resolve this issue?\n\nA: At the bottom of the screen of software-center there is a link \"Show NNNN technical items\". Click that link.\nAt the top right there is a search box. Type the name of your package there.\nAnd to answer your actual question: the information about installed packages is stored in /var/lib/dpkg and can be queried with dpkg-query -l (or various other frontends). There is no separate backend for each frontend. That is also why you get errors about a locked database when you try to run two dpkg frontends at the same time, like synaptic and software-center.\n", "Q: How can I hide all windows and show the desktop quickly? I know there are supposed to be several ways to do this, but I will explain why they don't work for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Super+D and Super+Ctrl+D both result in this bug. So does the \"Show Desktop\" button in the Unity launcher and the \"Show Desktop\" that appears in the Alt+Tab app switcher. I'm guessing that all four execute the same command(s).\n\n*I use Docky. But the Docky docklet \"Show Desktop\" does not work due to this bug.\n\n*I don't use the Unity launcher (I hide it) but I guess, as a last resort, I wouldn't be uninterested in ways that involve it. I read about something called \"My Unity,\" but I couldn't find out how to install it. Anyhow, I am primarily interested in a way that uses a keyboard shortcut or Docky.\nSo there are three really nice ways to hide all windows and show the desktop that, unfortunately, don't work at the moment.\nIn this question I am asking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*A way to solve one or more of these bugs.\n\n*More ways to accomplish the same thing, without the bugs.

No dual-boot. Kubuntu only.\nEverything seems to work... with one exception: After shutting down (or restarting) from Kubuntu, the Notebook will not boot correctly a single time. \nWhen I shut down the system everything seems ok. Then when pressing the power button I can see the Dell logo for a short time (also some kind of progress bar at the bottom) as usual. Then the screen is blinking in different shades of black, then nothing more happens. No GRUB menu. In this situation pressing <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<Del> restarts the Notebook and GRUB is reached and everything works fine. Also succeeding restarts (without booting into Kubuntu) are without problem. However as soon as I boot into Kubuntu and shutdown/restart from there the next single restart of the Notebook will fail.\nHow is it possible that it makes a difference for BIOS and/or GRUB that the previous session was shutdown from the OS? Shouldn't BIOS/GRUB completely forget about the last session and do a clean restart after system was shut down successfully?\nAny idea what the problem could be? \n\nA: I solved this by disabling the Legacy ROM option in the BIOS settings while leaving UEFI enabled. After reinstallation the laptop now boots as expected.\nI didn't try disabling UEFI completely since I prefer that mode.\n", "Q: Reading and writing a file: tee command It is well known that a command like this:\ncat filename | some_sed_command >filename\n\nerases file filename, as the output redirection, being executed before the command, causes filename to be truncated.\nOne could solve the issue in the following way:\ncat file | some_sed_command | tee file >/dev/null\n\nbut I'm not sure this would work in any case: what happens if file (and the result of the sed command) is very big? How can the operating system avoid to overwrite some content which is still not read? I see that there is also a sponge command which should work in any case: is it \"safer\" than tee?\n\nA: \nOne could solve the issue in the following way:\n\ncat file | some_sed_command | tee file >/dev/null\n\nNo.\nThe chances file will be truncated drop, but there's no guarantee cat file | some_sed_command | tee file >/dev/null will not truncate file.\nIt all depends on which command is processed first, as opposed to what one may expect, commands in a pipe are not processed left-to-right. There's no guarantee about which command will be picked first, so one might as well just think of it as randomly picked and never rely on the shell not picking the offending one.\nSince the chances for the offending command to be picked first in between three commands are lower than the chances for the offending command to be picked first in between two commands, it's less likely that file will be truncated, but it's still going to happen.\nscript.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor ((i=0; i<100; i++)); do\n    cat >file <<-EOF\n    foo\n    bar\n    EOF\n    cat file |\n        sed 's/bar/baz/' |\n        tee file >/dev/null\n    [ -s file ] &&\n        echo 'Not truncated' ||\n        echo 'Truncated'\ndone |\n    sort |\n    uniq -c\nrm file\n\n% bash script.sh\n 93 Not truncated\n  7 Truncated\n% bash script.sh\n 98 Not truncated\n  2 Truncated\n% bash script.sh\n100 Not truncated\n\nSo never use something like cat file | some_sed_command | tee file >/dev/null. Use sponge as Oli suggested.\nAs an alternative, for thighter environments and / or relatively small files one may use a here string and a command substitution to read the file before any command is run:\n$ cat file\nfoo\nbar\n$ for ((i=0; i<100; i++)); do <<<\"$(<file)\" sed 's/bar/baz/' >file; done\n$ cat file\nfoo\nbaz\n\n\nA: For sed specifically, you can use its -i in-place argument. It just saves back to the file it opened, eg:\nsed -i 's/ /-/g' filename\n\nIf you want to do something beefier, assuming you're doing more than sed, yes, you can buffer the whole thing with sponge (from the moreutils package) which will \"soak up\" all the stdin before writing out to the file. It's like tee but with less functionality. For basic usage though, it's pretty much a drop-in replacement:\ncat file | some_sed_command | sponge file >/dev/null\n\nIs that safer? Definitely. It probably has limits through so if you're doing something colossal (and can't in-place edit with sed), you might want to do your edits to a second file and then mv that file back to the original filename. That should be atomic (so anything depending on these files won't break if they need constant access).\n\nA: Oh, but sponge is not the only option; you do not have to obtain moreutils in order to get this to work properly.  Any mechanism will work as long as it satisfies the following two requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*It accepts the name of the output file as a parameter.\n\n*It only creates the output file once all input has been processed.\n\n\nYou see, the well known problem that the OP is referring to is that the shell will create all of the files that are necessary for the pipes to work before even beginning to execute the commands in the pipeline, so it is the shell that actually truncates the output file (which unfortunately is also the input file) before any of the commands have even had a chance to start executing.\nThe tee command does not work, even though it satisfies the first requirement, because it does not satisfy the second requirement: it will always create the output file immediately upon starting, so it is essentially as bad as creating a pipe straight into the output file.  (It is actually worse, because its use introduces a non-deterministic random delay before the output file gets truncated, so you might think that it works, while in fact it does not.)\nSo, all we need in order to solve this problem is some command that will buffer all of its input before producing any output, and that is capable of accepting the output filename as a parameter, so that we do not have to pipe its output into the output file.  One such command is shuf. So, the following will accomplish the same thing that sponge does:\n    shuf --output=file --random-source=/dev/zero \n\nThe --random-source=/dev/zero part tricks shuf into doing its thing without  doing any shuffling at all, so it will buffer your input without altering it.\n\nA: You can use Vim in Ex mode:\nex -sc '%!some_sed_command' -cx filename\n\n\n\n*\n\n*% select all lines\n\n*!

It's actually running an rsync command to a remote server, and the associated ssh connection.\nIf the rsync command or script takes too long I'd like to kill it and its child processes, but give it a grace period first. The script runs every hour, but the next 2 attempts will see that a previous instance of the script is running and exit before trying to commence a transfer. The third subsequent attempt will kill the original, still running instance, before starting a new transfer.\nI've decided to control this by writing to a PID file, first instance writes its PID to the file, the next two attempts write their PID to the file before exiting. The third attempt kills the first one, then overwrites the PID file with the new PID. Any successful completion wipes the PID file. To kill all children I've decided to use the PGID of the original script instance which I get with:\nprevious_pid=$(head -n1 \"$pid_file\")\nprevious_groupid=$(ps -hp \"$previous_pid\" -o pgid:1)\n\nThen kill it with:\nkill -- -\"$previous_pid\"\n\nMy concern is that there may be a condition where the original script has somehow died without cleaning up the PID file, and that PID is being reused also reusing the PGID, so I'll end up killing a completely unrelated process. How can I avoid this?\n\nA: Get the script to kill itself. For example, have something like this at the start of your script:\nkill_myself () {\n    while sleep 1\n    do\n        if [[ -f /tmp/kill-myself ]]\n        then\n            rm /tmp/kill-myself\n            kill -- -$1\n        fi\n    done\n}\n\nkill_myself $$ &\n\nNow, when the time comes:\ntouch /tmp/kill-myself\n\nYou could customize this, so that each instance of the script has its own kill file, which you would log somewhere. Then you'll use that file to kill that specific instance of the script.\n\nAnother way: You could probably use pgrep/pkill for finer matching. They can read from a pid file, match against the command name and arguments, etc.\nSomething like the following will only kill processes that have the same name as your script (assuming you invoked it as script-name or /path/to/script-name):\npkill -g \"$previous_groupid\" script-name\n\nThis won't work if you do bash script-name. Or just to kill the rsync command, which should probably get your script to exit after that:\npkill -g \"$previous_groupid\" rsync\n\n", "Q: Remove grey border around pavucontrol in 16.04 This issue is best illustrated with an image:\n\nAs you can see above there is a grey border around the actual contents of the application.\nWhat I've tried thus far is to modify the contents of .config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css according to the pointers given on a probably unrelated bug on CSD.\nI've tried to select the area around the contents with gtk-inspector but to no avail.\n\nNeither does applying, as seen above, a style removing margins, padding and borders to the background-class associated with the upper-most gtk element have any effect.\nHaving no experience at all with gtk development I'm unsure where to go from here.\n\nA: It turns out that this was a bug in pavucontrol which should be fixed with a future release: https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pulseaudio-discuss/2016-March/025937.html\n", "Q: Send event on global keypress - have a listener in terminal react and run another program? Ok, this is my problem: I have an application I want to screenshot; but because gnome-screenshot and mate-screenshot hide toolbars or whatnot each time they take a screenshot when started from the interactive applet window, they mess up the window of the application I'm screenshotting, which then crashes.

I have a directory called my_projects_linux inside the Ubuntu file system, which contains all my work from many years. The directory contains files, subdirectories and so on.\nFor backup purposes, I occasionally copy this directory and all its contents to external hard drive.\nHence, the contents of my external drive look like:\n/mounted_drive/my_projects_linux\n/mounted_drive/my_projects_windows  # the same idea to backup Windows work\n\nHence, what I am looking is a command which:\n\n\n*\n\n*Would work as \ncp /home/my_projects_linux /mounted_drive/my_projects_linux\n\nIt should replace old files, subdirectories, files inside subdirectories, etc. in the external disk by the new content from my PC.\n\n*Be fast. It should only copy modified files or those that have been newly created. Given that the size of my_projects_linux is >50 GB, copying everything takes more than an hour, which is too slow. In reality often only a few MB have changed since last backup, so theoretically a copy can be made much faster.\nHow to do that?\nI googled that cp with the -u flag could possibly match my needs. Would that work (e.g. would it correctly handle subdirectories of subdirectories)?\nAlso, is storing file system on an external disk an appropriate way of doing a backup, or is there a fancier way? For example, using a cloud? Note that the fancier way should be simple, as otherwise it will not outweigh the ease of executing one shell command.\n\nA: You're sort of describing what rsync was designed for. From man rsync:\n   Rsync  finds  files  that  need to be transferred using a \"quick\n   check\" algorithm (by default) that looks  for  files  that  have\n   changed  in  size  or in last-modified time.  Any changes in the\n   other preserved attributes (as requested by options) are made on\n   the  destination  file  directly  when the quick check indicates\n   that the file’s data does not need to be updated.\n\nThere's also a lot of guff about networking, but it's happy doing local too.\nEssentially all you need is:\nrsync -rtv /home/my_projects_linux /mounted_drive/my_projects_linux\n\nThere are a ton of options available but -rtv will sync recursively, keeping the timecodes the same, while being verbose about what it's doing.\n\nA: To answer your second question, a more fancy way to backup is rdiff-backup.\n\nrdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a\n  network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory,\n  but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that\n  target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago.\n  The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an\n  incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard\n  links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership, modification times,\n  extended attributes, acls, and resource forks.\n\nAnd if you really want to go cloud-based: I use CrashPlan with a paid subscription. Then you never have to think about manual backups any more.\n\nA: I know this question already has an accepted answer. However, I wanted to add a cross platform GUI solution as I see you also use windows. I use for the same purposes Freefilesync.

I want to be able flexibly add several Operating Systems to the USB and get them appear on the menu when trying to power on my laptop from USB. The menu itself appears on boot, but the pointer to the operating system is invalid.\n\nA: A very simple way of creating a GRUB menuentry for a bootable ISO file is to use grml-rescueboot.\nThe package does the following:\nCreates a /boot/grml folder.\nAutomatically adds menuentries to the GRUB menu for any ISO files located in the /boot/grml folder. This is accomplished whenever the update-grub command is executed.\n    The created menuentry, when selected, provides submenu options on how to boot the ISO, including the \"Try Ubuntu\" and \"Install\" options. \nTo use the grml-rescueboot option:\n1. Install grml-rescueboot sudo apt-get install grml-rescueboot\n2. Place bootable ISO files in the /boot/grml folder. Since this is a system folder, the operation must be conducted as \"root\". For example, if the ISO is located in the user's Downloads folder, the command would be:\nsudo mv ~/Downloads/<filename.iso> /boot/grml/\n3. Update GRUB\nsudo update-grub\nSince you want to boot from USB, I would suggest that you install a Light version of Ubuntu like xubuntu to the USB drive, boot it and then follow the instructions above installing grub and updating on the USB drive.

This version doesn't create an user account. So it is not possible to login with your user.\nIt makes no sense to repair this broken version because 13.04 is now unsupported and upgrades from 13.04 to the next supported version 14.04 are not faster than a fresh install.\nPlease try a supported Ubuntu version from here or if you need a smaller image to reduce download time, probably Lubuntu is a good choice for you. see here. In general, use .iso and not .torrent downloads because .torrent downloads are slower.\nAfter downloading copy iso file with Rufus to a pendrive and boot into pendrive to install Ubuntu.\nIf you still think you need Wubi, copy iso file and wubi.exe in the same folder and run wubi.exe.

A team of sharp developers at Microsoft has been hard at work adapting some Microsoft research technology to basically perform real time translation of Linux syscalls into Windows OS syscalls.  Linux geeks can think of it sort of the inverse of \"wine\" -- Ubuntu binaries running natively in Windows.  Microsoft calls it their \"Windows Subsystem for Linux\".  (No, it's not open source at this time.)\n…\nSo as part of the engineering work, I needed to wrap the stock Ubuntu root filesystem into a Windows application package (.appx) file for suitable upload to the Windows Store.\n\nA few slides from one of the presentations:\n\nSo this is similar to User-mode Linux and coLinux, but Microsoft apparently built it's own implementation that doesn't require running a Linux kernel.\n\n\nThe community from Microsoft's point of view and what they are planning.\nFinally Ubundows Unlimited, yay.\n\nA: There's some info from an announcement about it on Windows' blog Run Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.

Is there any macro recorders for ubuntu?\nI want a program that i could assign a key to do a recorded mouse movement and keyboard typing.\nThanks  \n\nA: Instead of recording a macro, it might be more useful to script it from scratch with xdotool. It gives you far more control over the process. \nFrom your description, I assume that you need something more permanent and not a macro that is only used a few times after recording it. I know this may not be what you are wishing for but it may be the best solution.\nA recorded macro would fail with missing windows, different window sizes etc. as it is blind to its environment. I doubt that is acceptable in your case.\nWith xdotool could identify windows and manipulate them to your parameters, and then program clicks relative to them, ignoring their position. \nYou can even execute commands from within a pure xdotool script and close their window after the job is done. \nsudo apt install xdotool\n\nTo get the right position for your clicks you can move your window into the top left corner and use:\nALT+F2\nxterm -hold -e /usr/bin/xdotool getmouselocation\n\nKeep in mind that on Ubuntu you usually cannot move your window to the coordinates 0,0. You would have to calculate the offset.\nCreate a text file for your xdotool script. Let's call it xdoscript.\nThis is a sample script for xdotool:\nsearch --name xdowindow\nwindowfocus\nwindowsize 1000 800\nmousemove --window %@ 200 100\nclick 3\nsleep 2\nmousemove --window %@ 400 200\nclick 1\nsleep 1\nclick 3\nmousemove_relative --polar 140 5\nsleep 1\nclick 1\nsleep 1\ntype \"man xdotool\"\nsleep 2\nkey Return\nsleep 2\nkey Next\nsleep 1\nkey Next\nsleep 1\nkey Next\nsleep 1\nkey q\n\nI tried to get this working with gnome-terminal but gnome-terminal has been a major failure for some time and since then its window title cannot be changed, so I used Sakura for testing instead. The sleep commands are just to slow it down to a watchable speed.\nsudo apt install sakura\n\nStart Sakura with the custom name xdowindow and start the xdotool script in it:\nsakura -t xdowindow\nxdotool xdoscript   \n\nFor your own script you would need the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*the window title\n\n*the window id (only if your window title is not unique)\n\n*a defined window size (if click points change with different sizes)\n\n\nOf course, although such scripts are much more robust than recorded macros, they are by no means portable. If you change your desktop settings such as font size or reinstall your system, they might stop working and would require adjustment. \nPS: The windowfocus command is required for most other commands to work.\n\nA: You can use X-Macro.\nTo install x-Macro use this command:\nsudo apt-get install xmacro\n\nFor record use xmacrorec2 command:\nxmacrorec2 > test.file\n\nfor play recorded macro use xmacroplay \nxmacroplay \"$DISPLAY\" < test.file\n\n\nA: Take a look at Gnu - Xnee\nLink: http://www.gnu.org/software/xnee/\nFor the command line application on ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install cnee\n\nN.B: xnee is a meta package in ubuntu and installing that will also install cnee. gnee is the package you should install if you want a gui.\nExample usage:\ncnee --record -o events.xnr --mouse --events-to-record 100 --time 2\n\nThis records 100 mouse events after a delay of 2 seconds.\ncnee --replay -f events.xnr --time 2\n\nThis playbacks the events after a delay of 2 seconds.\nI would look at the man page for cnee for more details about how to use it. \nAlso more details about xnee can be found here https://xnee.wordpress.com/\n\nA: Actiona is not a recorder, it's a task automation tool.

Consider using Magnet links, open trackers, DHT!\nIf you need future assistance, ask in comments!\n", "Q: Load one-time use terminator layouts What I would like to accomplish is to create an script/program that writes a terminator config file with a one-time use layout and then tell terminator 'use this config file instead of ~/.config/terminator/config' and load layout 'tmp' from it.\nUse case:\nOften I have to ssh into many servers to do exactly the same operation in all of them, the set of servers could vary so I could not possibly have an static layout that I could use all the time. If I could create such temporary layout with each terminal ssh-ing into a different server (using ssh @server as default command) and grouping all the terminals I could get my job done in a matter of seconds.\n\nA: The solution was in man terminator_config. In my particular solution was to define\nexport XDG_CONFIG_HOME=\"/tmp\";\nas part of my own script, then at the very last part of the script\ninvoke the terminator instance, this way the variable will be only defined inside that bash/terminal instance (and its childs) and will not contaminate the default terminator's behavior. Below a pseudo-code example:\nmany_ssh_terminals.sh:\n export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=\"/tmp\";\n mkdir > /tmp/terminator;\n write_config_with_layout > /tmp/terminator/config; \n terminator -l tmp_layout\n\n", "Q: How to execute PHP code in Linux every 500 milliseconds?

This tutorial looks fine for that:\nCreating my own systemd service files\n\nA: Since you are familiar with PHP you can make a PHP daemon/service.

Pressing the down-key in Bash does nothing. cmd keeps point-in-time history (similar to the Back and Forward buttons in a web browser), but Bash doesn't.\nSimilarly with cmd, pressing the up-key twice in cmd brings back echo command1, whereas doing this in Bash returns echo command3.\nThere are many times when I wish to excuse some chain of commands which I previously entered in order. It's really handy in cmd that I can scroll back through history to the first of the sequence and then, ↓, ENTER, ↓, ENTER, ↓, ENTER...\nHowever I cannot find a similar way to do this in Bash. Is it possible to modify ~/.inputrc or some other file in some way to achieve this?\n\nA: Although personally I would not want to do it as I've got used to the bash history, but I can see why people would want to. I have looked into this before, for a colleague at work, who was new to *nix and wanted DOS-like functionality in an xterm, and then, as now, there does not appear to be a solution.\nI have just done another extensive search, and can't find anything obvious, apart from:\n\n\n*\n\n*DOSEMU, which is not quite what you are after, and;\n\n*Make your Linux command line work like DOS with shell scripting, but the link seems to be somewhat intermittent, and besides this is probably not what you really want. This link merely provides ways of substituting Unix commands for DOS commands, by using custom scripts. \n\n\nStrangely, there are plenty of ways to make cmd more bash like, for example, Bash History-like feature for Windows Command Prompt, but sadly not the other way around.\nThe main problem is, to put it (overly) simply, that the cursor key functionality (and how it interacts with the history) is built into the Bash source code, and scripting, aliases and shell functions can not override that fact1. What you would require is a rewritten bash, with different [switchable?] cursor key functionality built in to it, a sort of \"DOSBash\", if you will.\nMaybe there is the opportunity of a niche market being catered for, and someone will eventually fulfill that need, but I wouldn't hold your breath.\n\n1 If I am incorrect, and it is possible to override the cursor key functionality by a simple resource file change, I would be delighted if someone could put me straight.\n\nA: The trick I use, such as it is, is to simply repeat the same number of ↑:\n$ echo command1\n$ echo command2\n$ echo command3\n$ echo command4\n\nIf I want to repeat the sequence from echo command 2 to echo command4, I just hit ↑ 3 times to get to echo command2, and then 3 times again to get to echo command3 and 3 times again for echo command4.\nSo, if you've gone back N items in your history by hitting ↑ N times, hitting it N times again will get you to the next command each time because the new one you ran has been inserted. \n", "Q: want to access my Samba shared folder from outside my Local network On Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 I installed Samba server and its working perfect within my Local network .\nNow , I need to access the file outside my network , for that I opened port 137, 138, 139 and 445 on ubuntu and on my Router as well .Even after this I am unable to access samba by Public IP .\nPlease suggest me .\nThanks .   \n\nA: This is not the answer you want but...\n1) Close those ports\nSamba shares over the internet is very insecure.

If you get some dependencies error you can run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nwhich should solve package dependencies errors.\nAfter installation you can double-click on Autorun.exe and launch the DVD application.\nI've got same problem with a DVD found in a school book and I've solved it in this way.\n", "Q: Error: The new file /usr/lib/php/7.0/php.ini-production.cli does not exist!

I'm using mount.cifs to mount a shared folder on this server.\nHere's my mount script:\n#!/bin/bash    \nstweb=\"/mnt/stweb\"\nif ! mount|grep $stweb; then\n    sudo mkdir -p $stweb\n    sudo mount.cifs //<server IP>/folder $stweb -o uid=1000,gid=1000,user=<myuser>,password=<mypassword>,domain=<mydomain>\nfi\n\nHere's my umount script:\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo umount -a -t cifs -l\n\nThey work!\nBut the problem is: sometimes, due to poor network conditions, the VPN connection is interrupted; thus the share stops working. After reconnecting, I usually run my umount script and then the mount script . But sometimes the mount script hangs for a VERY LARGE amount of time at the mount.cifs command. I can't event send a CTRL+C to kill the process. The mounting operation works again after a system reboot.\nRebooting at this situation is time consuming and unproductive. Any ideas of what is happening?

I've tried umount -l xxx, which doesn't hang, but then we do hang when trying to mount the share. One problem seems to be that you need to remount the share before any process tries to open a file on it. This can be very tricky if you have soft-links pointing into the shared file system.\nEven crazier: If the system is stuck, smbmount still works without a hitch, even as the mount on the same volume is hung for more than 10 minutes.\n\nA: This post on Ubuntu Forums answered it for me.\nI had to add vers=3.0 option in /etc/fstab for that mount point.\n\nA: On a Mac hosting the shares it is sometimes necessary to restart file sharing on the Mac (it is simple enough to restart the Mac) before the shares can be mounted again, the culprit will not be the Linux client in such a scenario (though it will appear to be as key processes go into disk sleep state).  This is also true if something goes wrong on the Mac while the shares are mounted and umount becomes unresponsive.  In such a scenario neither umount -l nor fuser -km will work, both will hang indefinitely.\n", "Q: Is it possible to workaround the Redshift geoclue bug?

When you try to open these files in an alternative PDF viewer, then you will see this error message.\n\nHow are such files meant to be opened on Ubuntu given the official Adobe Acrobat Reader package is deprecated?\nIt's not a real problem for me practically as I have actually managed to install Adobe Acrobat Reader 9 (BTW I am, however, afraid this ancient version is going to start having problems with opening new files of this kind soon) on Xubuntu 15.10 a reasonably tidy way by unpacking the old Ubuntu DEB package, putting the necessary files to a subdirectory in /opt and editing the Reader's launch scripts but I believe it's a pretty serious issue for using Ubuntu in commercial/academy/government environments so there is to be a more proper way.\n\nA: Recent drafts of PDF next-generation (ISO 32000-2) note that there was a vote to deprecate XFA:\n\nEditor’s note: XFA forms have been deprecated from ISO 32000-2 in accordance with the outcome of the letter ballot following the Pretoria meetings.\n\nAs explained at 3 Alternatives to the Adobe PDF Reader on Linux | Linux.com | The source for Linux information, features like Extended form filling (such as XFA Forms) and Embedded 3D models won't work in most open source implementations.\nSo I suggest pushing back to the people producing the documents, explaining that they are not accessible to people in a variety of situations, are not supported by e.g. the Chrome PDF viewer or open source viewers, and that they thus increase the attack surface and increase security risks.  So they should drop use of XFA.\n\nA: I just now used the free online service at https://speedtesting.herokuapp.com/pdfxfa/ \"XFA PDF to Normal PDF (XFA Form Flatten)\".

Of course, it's a bit of a project to actually get working - you'll need winetricks (and a bunch of things it can scrounge up, perhaps atmlib ie8 vcrun6 wininet msxml3 msxml6 corefonts riched20 wsh57 but YMMV), fonts, and possibly a bunch of other stuff. Might want to try a virtual machine with the same version of Ubuntu before you start messing with your host machine. But I discovered a way to get things working with CentOS 7 (I needed the 32 bit Wine to install Reader, which made things more complicated because CentOS doesn't supply that) , so Ubuntu ought to be a walk in the park!\n\nA: Chrome should work BUT Chrome first needs the NotablePDF plugin to actually view the PDF. Make sure you have that plugin. That should get you smooth sailing viewing PDF via a browser.

Booting into Ubuntu is not an option. Can someone please help me?\n\nA: (From our discussions in the comments)\nThe program you used to burn Ubuntu to the USB stick (I have nevereven heard of Win32 Disk Imager before now) was causing problems. A much better alternative to creating bootable USB sticks is Rufus. Use that to reburn the USB stick and you will be able to boot into the installation.\nIf you need to create bootable USBs in Ubuntu, use UNetbootin. If you prefer open-source software, even on Windows, use that as well. It isn't quite as stable as Rufus, nor does it have the best success rate. However, it's cross-platform and open-source.\n\nA: Before your computer loads any OS, when you see your manufacturers loading screen, there will be a prompt when will allow you to enter your BIOS settings. Hit the key it says, Esc for me, and then from the boot menu select your USB. This should load up Ubuntu instead of Windows. You need to do this because, by default, your computer is setup to load Windows first before anything else.\n\nA: As soon as the system boots it will display on the screen press \"something on keyboard\" to change settings. It may say to enter bios. On some systems it is the ESC key or F12 or DEL. You have to look for the message right after you turn it on. Do not cold boot \"restart from within the operating system\". Shut the machine down so it is off and use the power button to turn it on.\nOnce in the bios you may have to search for your boot preferences, boot order or something like that.

The rand function prints a random fractional number between 0 and the argument given. $#ARGV is the number of arguments given to the script, here, all files (and subdirectories) in the current directory. Since rand returns fractional numbers, we pass it through int() to get an integer. So, int(rand($#ARGV)) picks one of the indices in the @ARGS array randomly and therefore $ARGV[int(rand($#ARGV))] is one of the files. \n", "Q: How to make a daemon which checks if a program is running (at regular intervals) and starts it if it is not? I am on Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, but I don't like the normal applications launcher so I have installed Docky, however often Docky suddenly closes and I am forced to manually restart it, so I was wondering how I could make a daemon which runs all the time in the background that would check at regular intervals if Docky is running, and if it is not, run it?\n\nA: Create a script anywhere you want it to be, preferably in your home directory.  I like to call mine, check_docky.bsh.  In your script, do the following lines:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nps -ef | grep -i docky.exe | grep -v grep >/dev/null\n\ncase $? in\n1) sh -c \"mono /usr/lib/docky/Docky.exe\";;\n0) exit 0;;\nesac\n\nIn the above script, the ps -ef | grep will look to see if Docky is running.  If it is not running the exit code that gets returned is 1, so then the case statement would relaunch Docky automatically.  Else, the script would exit normally with a code 0.\nMake sure the script is executable:\nchmod +x check_docky.bsh\n\nThen create a cron job for the script.  \nFirst, run crontab as you:\n$ crontab -e\n\nThen as a new entry add the following so that it will check every 10 minutes starting at :00 of the hour:\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n*/10 * * * * /home/<username>/check_docky.bsh\n\nTo show that this command works:\n~$ ps -ef | grep wookie | grep -v grep\n~$ echo $?\n1\n~$ ps -ef | grep wookie\nterrance  20978  6976  0 13:53 pts/17   00:00:00 grep --color=auto wookie\n~$ echo $?\n0\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Firefox crashing like crazy Firefox has started crashing like crazy lately.

could be way off, but this error report seems to be indicating that it is not necessarily Firefox that is the problem (since you also mentioned chromium having issues).  I'm looking at the top of the report:\nOpenGL: Intel Open Source Technology Center -- Mesa DRI Intel(R) Haswell Mobile -- 3.0 Mesa 11.0.2 -- texture_from_pixmap.\nThis may not be the correct direction to point you in, but it seems your OpenGL drivers are not functioning correctly or at the very least aren't playing well with others.  Did you happen to install a different driver recently?  Do you remember if there were any key system updates around the time when chromium started performing very poorly?\nYou appear to be using the Mesa drivers, and likely have an Intel HD **** integrated graphics cpu?  The Mesa drivers should be exactly what you want...\nIf you do not have a dedicated graphics card (e.g. an NVIDIA card), I would suggest searching around for Graphics driver <your specific cpu>, maybe including Ubuntu in the search as well.  lscpu should give you the exact model name.  It could be that your specific CPU needs some special setup?  This is very unlikely.\nAgain, I don't know that new / different graphics drivers are the right solution here.  If you do decide to make a stab at this, definitely make a full backup of your system so it is easy to revert to.  Messing up the graphics drivers can have a lot of really annoying side effects (including not being able to load Unity [the desktop window system]).\nThe only other thing that comes to mind is you could try avoiding ubufox and see if you have different results.  After you uninstall firefox, you can follow the directions here:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/661384/418575\nThis may give you different results?  But that also shouldn't really be necessary.\n\nA: I'm sorry everyone, it seems as if I fixed all the crashing by simply disabling hardware acceleration. I should probably have tried this the first thing I did.\nAgain, I'm sorry for taking up your time.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 DVD iso when boots is unreadable on a new PC with gtx 745 card I recently purchased a Dell 8700 with a GTX 745 video card for improving speed performance for financial and statistical programming that I write. I prefer high performance chips but am not a gamer. \nMy issue is with the graphics card. When I created a boot CD for Ubuntu 15.10 the monitor display through the VGA port shows the screen with many letters in the text missing. Since I've installed Ubuntu 15.10 before I muddled through the unreadable screens and managed to install. Once Ubuntu 15.10 installed on the hard drive the same unreadable screens came up. Luckily the terminal screens were not so affected by this issue. I compiled the Nvidia Kernel and then installed the package provided via their site and viola the video display came up in a very readable state. So I was able to resolve the video problem on a hard drive install. \nThe problem is that I could not resolve how to fix the video problem running off a Live CD. I've called Nvidia tech support and their answer is the card won't support the Live CD version of Ubuntu 15.10. OK so the next question that I asked was is there any other product you sell that would resolve this problem. No real clear answer on this either from their tech support.  I wrote to AMD and they claim that their Video cards will support most Live CD's based on Linux. Great, get an AMD card seemed to be the solution. But then after reading several articles  it seems the AMD Radeon R9 card is the worst thing to happen to Linux while the NVidia 900 series has been a real improvement. \nI've had other display issues with multiple Live CD's that I use. Clonezilla, although the text is readable, appears compressed. G Parted text although appears in whole is displayed all over the page instead of paragraph form, and Fedora 23 and Mint 17 have incomplete text on their screens similar to the Ubuntu 15.10 install.\nCan anyone suggest a decent video card that will display Linux programs cleanly on the monitor while using either live CD's or hard drive installs.  I understand for advanced graphics applications I need to install proprietary drivers but just to get readable screens on Live CD's to run Ubuntu hard drive installs or use G Parted off the hard drive for partitioning should not be impossible as with the Nvidia GTX 745. I prefer a card with some heftiness to it because I am constantly researching on the web and some of these sites really stream a lot of advertisements which slows down the browsing on my older machines. I don't have an unlimited budget to plug and play with components but am coming around to the idea of swapping out a prepackaged video card with another if that is what it takes. I am just looking for some video card that will show basic Live CD screens without scrambling them up. From my research the Nvidia GTX 745 is not it.\nThank you\nZV Rotenberg\n\nA: If you are simply trying to boot the live cd for the sake of installing it, then you can add nomodeset to the boot parameters.  For live CD's you usually need to select an \"Advanced\" option, but at some point you should be able to hit e to edit the boot parameters.\nYou will get a screen that will have a bunch of text, and one of the lines will start with vmlinuz ...stuff.. quiet splash.  Use your arrow keys to go to the end of the line and add nomodeset to that line, and hit F10 to boot.  stuff should be the kernel version, and possibly some other flags.  This will boot it in \"Simple Graphics Mode\" which should work even without the NVIDIA drivers installed.  It will be very poor resolution, but you can at least function.\nThe only other alternative I have ever had success with was connecting the monitor to the motherboard output (rather than the GPU), and it usually doesn't even use the GPU.  Sometimes, though, you have to actually disconnect the GPU...which isn't a very practical solution.\n\nA: Try nouveau.modeset=0/inserted in grub boot string where just after word splash. It is a known issue with 15.10 and NVidia cards. Than after booting up install Ubuntu and after - install NVidia drivers from repository.\n", "Q: How do I encrypt a new user's password using the useradd command? I would like to create an encrypted login password for a new user while using the useradd command in the CLI. I know that using option -p will allow me to create a password, but using this option does not encrypt the password. I also know that I can create an encrypted password using the passwd [username] command separately after the new user has been created through useradd, but like I said, I would like to know how to create an encrypted password through the useradd command.\n\nA: You could use Perl:\nperl -e \"print crypt(\\\"foo\\\", \\\"\\$6\\$$(</dev/urandom tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 32)\\$\\\")\"\n\nOr Python with the crypt module:\npython -c \"import crypt; print crypt.crypt(\\\"foo\\\", \\\"\\$6\\$$(</dev/urandom tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 32)\\$\\\")\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*foo: the password to encrypt\n\n*$6: the encryption type, in this case SHA-512\n\n*$(</dev/urandom tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 32): the encryption salt, in this case a random 32 character string.\n\n\nIn conjunction with useradd:\nuseradd [...] -p\"$(perl -e \"print crypt(\\\"foo\\\", \\\"\\$6\\$$(</dev/urandom tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 32)\\$\\\")\")\" [...]\n\nOr:\nuseradd [...] -p\"$(python -c \"import crypt; print crypt.crypt(\\\"foo\\\", \\\"\\$6\\$$(</dev/urandom tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 32)\\$\\\")\")\" [...]\n\n\nA: You could skip the whole administrator-created-password user administration hassle by creating the userid, then using passwd --expire on it. From man passwd:  \n   -e, --expire\n       Immediately expire an account's password. This in effect can force\n       a user to change his/her password at the user's next login.\n\n\nA: Since passwd does not support --stdin in Ubuntu you could try this:\nperl -e \"print crypt('password','sa');\"\n\nsee https://administratosphere.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/generating-passwords-using-crypt3/\n\nA: You can use \"useradd -p ENCRYPTED-passwd\", you need the whole password, including the definition of encryption type, and you need to escape any and all $'s, other than that it seems to works fine.\nSimply create a random, disposable user, set their password to what you want to use, then copy their password from the shadow file, copy everything from the first to the second \":\" in the shadow file, and use that after the -p.\n\nA: The following worked for me w/Ubuntu 18.04 LTS:\necho 'your_password' > /tmp/pw.txt\npw=\"$(makepasswd --crypt-md5 --clearfrom=/tmp/pw.txt)\"\nsudo useradd -p \"${pw}\" your_username\nrm -f /tmp/pw.txt\n\nThis may first require installing makepasswd using (on Ubuntu or Debian; google for other distros):\nsudo apt install makepasswd\n\n", "Q: Cannot open 'PDF portfolio' How can I open a pdf portfolio (pdf file which contains multiple pdfs) that was made with Adobe on Mac or PC? \nI've tried FoxIt, Evince, and qpdfview but none of them work. \nI get a message saying \"For the best experience, open this PDF portfolio in Acrobat X or Adobe Reader X, or later.\" Unfortunately this is not possible since Adobe does not seem to support these on Ubuntu any more. \n\nA: Try  evince,  the GNOME document viewer\nHit F9 to make the sidebar on the left visible, then at the top of the Sidebar there is the \"Thumbnails\" menu. Click it. \n\nThen you'll see this:\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I guess, by default \"Thumbnails\" is selected.\n\n\n\nThen you can change to \"Attachments\".\n\nThis will make the Embedded PDFs visible (see below). You can click on any red PDF icons in the sidebar individually. It will open in a new pdf Window. \nYou can also multi-select (click topmost icon, hold shift, click lowermost icon)  the icons and then save them all at once, into individual files.\n\n\nA: My solution is based on this answer which suggests a few different PDF applications:\n\n\n\nI found that not all these programs actually work for this. In my case pdftk did not work and okular did. One down side with Okular is that you have to export the PDFs contained in a portfolio into individual files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open with Okular\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click first item then ctrl+a to select all\n\n\n\n\n\n*You'll be prompted to select a file name and location. You can just keep hitting enter.\n\n\nIt's not as good an experience as using Adobe but it gets the job done.\n\nA: Although Adobe has discontinued support for Adobe Reader, you can still download a version 9.5.5 from their website, and install it manually:\nwget http://ardownload.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/unix/9.x/9.5.5/enu/AdbeRdr9.5.5-1_i386linux_enu.deb\nsudo dpkg -i AdbeRdr9.5.5-1_i386linux_enu.deb\n\nYou should be able to view PDF Portfolio files with this version.\n\nA: Type \"about:plugins\" in the Chrome address bar, and then Disable 'PDF Viewer'. You will then be able to open PDF Portfolio documents as well. Check it out.\n", "Q: Error creating bootable USB using \"cat file.iso > /dev/sdb\" At first, I had this USB flash drive with a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS bootable in it. But now, I want to remove/wipe it and create a new bootable of another OS.\nFirst, I tried directly:\nsudo cat file.iso > /dev/sdb; sync\n\nAs suggested in this thread. It didn't worked, returned \n\nbash: /dev/sdb: Permission denied\n\nSo, I thought that this was happening because of it already containing a bootable and decide to wipe it. So I just shreded it \nsudo shred -v /dev/sdb\nAfter it, It wasn't appearing on the nautilus vertical nav as I sticked it into PC. So I made a file system for it sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb (I don't know if it's the right type of fs to make it but I was just testing anyway, if it isn't, please warn me about this)\nNow, I access it through nautilus and I see that it is indeed empty. I'm trying to make that command I was doing in the beginning sudo cat file.iso > /dev/sdb; sync but still having the same \"permission denied\" again.\nSo, two questions on that, did this mkfs was applied correctly or I shouldn't do that? And, how do I solve my problem of making my bootable iso finally? (I don't want to use unetbootin, couldn't install it and I read that it could be done using cat/sync) Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I have noticed that the other answers all seem to be questioning why you're using cat in this context, and then go on to suggest you use dd.\nThere's no need. The original command you posted is basically right, it just won't work with sudo (because direction is done by the shell, not by cat, so you don't have permission to do it), so get yourself initially to a root shell.\nsudo -i\n\nWhen you drop to the root prompt, issue your first command.\ncat file.iso > /dev/sdb; sync\n\nIt'll do exactly what you think, and write the ISO directly to the USB stick, and is probably the quicker and more sensible way to do this than using dd\nDon't forget to type\nexit\n\nWhen you've finished with the root shell.\n\nA: The command you try\nsudo cat file.iso > /dev/sdb; sync\n\nwould, if it does what you expect, completly overwrite the usb drive. So there is no need / no sense to create a ext3 filesystem on it before.\nYour mkfs.ext3 command in a sense is fine.\nThe actually cat command will not work because the sudo command runs as root but the redirection of the output does not. A simple way to get it working is\nsudo dd if=file.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=16k; sync\n\nAs this doesn't use output redirection there is no problem with sudo. \nThis is mentioned as the \"retro way\" in the question you linked to.\n\nA: Powerful but dangerous commands\ncat and dd can do the trick, to clone from an iso file to a mass storage device, for example a USB flash drive or a memory card.\nWhen you write to a device like this, you will overwrite what was there before, including the partition table and file systems. These commands do what you tell them to do without any questions. So if you tell them to wipe your family pictures, they will do it. And it is a minor typing error away.\nSince dd has been used traditionally for this purpose, it has deserved the nicknames 'Disk Destroyer' and 'Data Destroyer', but the same risks apply to cat, when used in this context.\nTools that identify the target device, and have a final checkpoint\nFor this reason it is better to use tools with help functions to identify the target device, and a final checkpoint, where you have an opportunity to check that you have selected the correct target device, the USB flash drive. This way you can avoid overwriting the internal drive with the operating system and various personal data files or an external drive with personal data files or backup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Cloning tools that produce the same result as cat and dd for this purpose,\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and newer versions\n\n*Disks alias gnome-disks\n\n*mkusb\n\n\n*Extracting tools that produce working USB boot drives, that are different (not cloned copies),\n\n\n*\n\n*Rufus (only in Windows)\n\n*Unetbootin (in Linux, Windows and MacOS)\n\n\n\n\nSee this link and links from it for more details,\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\n\nA: There is Etcher too to do this...\n", "Q: aterm not accepting keyboard input I am running Lubuntu 14.04 and it's default windowmanager.

Whenever I unmount a USB drive with Nautilus and plug it to a Windows machine, I receive a warning that the drive needs to be repaired.\n\n(the same message like in this screenshot)\nFor 10+ years working with windows I never had a corrupted or damaged USB drive but during the last two years three of my USB drives became inoperative, so I cannot prove it, but it's obvious that this is related to Ubuntu's (un)mount behavior.\nA friend told me I can prevent such damage using udisks and sync, but I hope this is not the way to do it, mounting drives with shell commands in 2016.\n\nA: This is mostly an issue with Windows. It thinks it is the only OS in the world and acts out if it detects something it does not understand.\nJust because Windows says you must repair the drive does not make it true.\nAny of my drives used with Ubuntu get this message from Windows, I just say no and they work fine with Windows.\nIn short there is nothing wrong with the drive, it is just there is something on there that Windows does not understand and its response is destroy it.\nDon't repair the drive, it will format it without telling you and you will lose all the data on the drive.\n\nA: I've seen lots of usb drives, especially flash (SD, etc) cards in USB adapters, with FAT filesystems (virtually every USB drive comes pre-formatted with FAT32) getting corrupted while using Ubuntu & Ubuntu-derived distros. It was almost a regular occurrence every few months of regular daily use. \nIf it were a hardware problem, then formatting the partitions with ext3 (or 4) shouldn't help, but ext3/4 makes the filesystems virtually bulletproof. (ext2 also was corrupted over the few months I tried it; was supposed to have less writes so a longer life for flash drives, mainly from no journal).\nSo, Ubuntu should not physically damage USB drives themselves, but I still don't trust it 100% with FAT filesystems.\nI think filesystem corruption can be best avoided by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Never just unplug a USB drive until after it's been unmounted/umount/ejected. Even if the drive's not currently writing anything (if it has a light it's not flashing) and even if you've done a sync the filesystem may still \n\n*Wait at least a few seconds after umount/eject before unplugging it. It seems that even after umount the drive's activity light may sometimes keep flashing for a little while. Other users like this guy say it could go on for up to a minute. \n\n*Don't only rely on only sync either, like this guy who got file corruption.\n\n\nRelated (generally) links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Answer to \"Should I unmount a USB drive before unplugging it?\"\n\n*Is execution of sync(8) still required before shutting down linux?\n\n*How to remove a USB drive without worrying if its been unmounted?\n\nA: This has little to do with any operating system. This is a file system error, which in most cases indicates that the drive was not unmounted properly (user error). It is not an absolute indication of damage, it merely indicates a possibility of a damage. If present, the damage is usually limited to the last written file(s). Windows \"Repair\" command in this case scans the drive for sectors marked as \"occupied\", but not assigned to any file and then assigns this scraps and pieces to new files.\nThis error can be also created on Windows, if you just yank out the drive during write without unmounting it first (in Windows \"Eject\" performs the unmount).\nSeeing this message means that the drive was not unmounted properly.\nYou can verify on your own if the file system was really damaged or is it just false positive: if after running \"Repair\" a new folder named like \"found000\" appears with some files in it, it means there really was an unfinished write that got interrupted. Some of your data were lost, and that is a concern.\n\nA: I use several years ubuntu and windows with dual-boot, and when i unmount the drive the correct way, in windows always show up the error message, but never was error on my usb drive. In W10 you can turn off this pop-up error message.\n\n\nA: As you suggested in a comment, this is possibly related to Ubuntu not completing the write process before you remove the flash drive. Ubuntu writes the files to RAM during the copying process, and writes these files from the buffer to the USB drive in the background after the copying dialog is closed. There's another answer that suggests this is especially a problem for machines with large amounts of memory, but it's likely that you're removing the drive before the background write is complete. When you eject a drive, this forces the buffer to be written to disk, but it is difficult to tell when the write is actually completed. There's a pop-up in newer versions (15.10 for certain, possibly 15.04) intended to remedy this -- a purple alert appears after some (generally short) time that says something along the lines of \"[Drive] can now be removed\" once the write is finished. \nThis is probably the reason your friend suggested sync. Running sync in terminal forces all buffered data to be written to disk, and should return only once the writes are completed (See this answer). See this answer for a utility that will help you determine if this is actually the problem. \n\nA: No worries Ubuntu did not damage your USB drive. But we do not use poorly documented bit flags of a FAT32, FAT16, or NTFS filesystem. On Windows these flags indicate a possibly corrupted filesystem when we had not properly unmounted the drive or an I/O error had occured.\nThose bits are located in a reserved entry of a FAT partition table. According to an internal Microsoft paper of 2004 the purpose of these bits are:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*ClnShutBitMask:\n  If bit is 1, the volume is “clean”. The volume can be mounted for\n  access. If bit is 0, the volume is “dirty” indicating that a FAT file\n  system driver was unable to dismount the volume properly (during a\n  prior mount operation). The volume contents should be scanned for\n  any damage to file system metadata.  \n  \n*HrdErrBitMask:\n  If this bit is 1, no disk read/write errors were encountered.\n  If this bit is 0, the file system driver implementation encountered a\n  disk I/O error on the volume the last time it was mounted, which is an\n  indicator that some sectors may have gone bad. The volume\n  contents should be scanned with a disk repair utility that does\n  surface analysis on it looking for new bad sectors.\n  \n\nThere was some discussion with the kernel file system developers some years ago on how to overcome this but I was unable to follow up the results. Apparently it did not make it into recent kernels.\nAs only a bit flag is involved but generally our data should be in perfect shape we can ignore the warning Windows issues on those drives we had previously used in Ubuntu.\n\nA: There is almost no way for any OS could damage USB drive, after a normal format (not the quick), there should be no trace left that drive was ever used with Ubuntu.\nCheck the drives with \"H2testw\" or \"USB Flash Drive Tester\" - bad sectors might be source of many weird errors.\n\nA: I can't say if the drive was \"damaged\", maybe it was and maybe it wasn't. But as someone who can say the same: \"For 10+ years working with windows...\", I can tell you that if you're running Windows 10 that could be the source of your new problems. I ran into a new problem my first day on 10: in 10 a database is created for external drives (it might be the indexing database, I don't remember). If that database doesn't match the drive it will tell you that your drive is damaged, sometimes you can ignore this warning and sometimes you can't (see anecdote). Running \"repair\" will fix the database.\nAnecdote:\n\nI can't remember where I found this information but I found out about it when I moved my Music folder. It complained that the drive was broken instead of just complaining about the folder it was looking for not existing anymore. Before I ran repair the new location appeared on Ubuntu and the old location on Windows 10...but all the files couldn't be opened on 10. After I ran repair the new location of the Music folder appeared in Windows, the old folder disappeared, and it worked on Windows again.\n\nRunning sync is also not a bad idea.\n", "Q: When I install Trimmomatics_V0.32 through the command line on ubuntu LTS 14.04, I get an error Any one can suggest me best option for these problem.\n\n\nA: That is the wrong package name, it should just be trimmomatic\nsudo apt-get install trimmomatic\n\nWill install your package.\n", "Q: Kill all processes linked to a port Kill all processes on port 3000.\nThis is what is tried:\nubuntu@111:~/chatapp$ sudo netstat -peanut|grep 3000\ntcp6       0      0 :::3000                 :::*                    LISTEN      0          632007      18200/node      \nubuntu@111:~/chatapp$ sudo kill 18200\nubuntu@111:~/chatapp$ sudo netstat -peanut|grep 3000\ntcp6       0      0 :::3000                 :::*                    LISTEN      0          632207      18349/node      \nubuntu@111:~/chatapp$ sudo killall node\nubuntu@111:~/chatapp$ sudo netstat -peanut|grep 3000\ntcp6       0      0 :::3000                 :::*                    LISTEN      0          632364      18414/node      \nubuntu@111:~/chatapp$ \n\n\nA: You can use following command to get only pid:\nsudo netstat -peanut | grep 3000 | awk '{ print $9 }' | sed 's:/[^/]*$::' | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,5}'\n\nawk command gets the 9-th field.\nsed command gets the pid before forward slash.\nAnd grep command returns only numbers to eliminate extra lines.\nHere you can simply have a loop and kill processes.\n\nA: Some programs won't show up unless you run netstat with sudo.

A malicious client may be eavesdropping on your session.\" I am running an installation of Ubuntu 14.04 that I setup more than 6 months.  About a week ago, I started getting an error message:\nCould not grab keyboard. A malicious client may be eavesdropping on your session.\n\nI have only ever seen it when returning to my computer after being away for quite a while (usually overnight).  Several times it has prevented the screen from locking after the set timeout (I have begun actively locking it before leaving).\nI am using a usb keyboard (Kinesis Advantage) directly connected to a usb port on the motherboard.  I am using a wireless ELECOM mouse.\nI am going to try disconnecting the mouse dongle before leaving.  How else could I identify if there is a malicious client tracking my keystrokes or if this is a connectivity issue?  \n\nA: Here's how to solve your mystery. The goal is more to teach users \"how to fish\" by using standard Ubuntu utilities to dig into the details of any process on their system.\nStep #1 (for curiosity mostly): identify which program is giving you this error:\n# -- You may need to search under more dirs, YMMV\n#    List files (incl. binaries) which contain the warning string\n\n$ sudo grep -ral 'malicious client may be eavesdropping' /usr /bin /lib\n/usr/lib/openssh/gnome-ssh-askpass\n\nIn my env the only program which contains this warning string in its binary is gnome-ssh-askpass. I could search if there's a bug filed on this particular program, and even download its source apt-get source ssh-askpass-gnome (note that the package name is different than the program name) for further inspection.\nHowever, I suspect the root cause is not a problem in gnome-ssh-askpass. Since gnome-ssh-askpass is asking for your passphrase, its developers simply chose to err on the side of caution when failing to grab the keyboard, assume the worst-case scenario, and make the message sound uber-paranoid. But note that typing your passphrase or password into some random web-site dialog-box by accident is probably not a good idea, so in that sense the gnome-ssh-askpass developers have made the right call.\nRecently more and more web sites have started engaging in the practice of displaying a popup, fading everything else outside the popup dialog, and aggressively grabbing focus. This might be the root cause for gnome-ssh-askpass failing to grab the keyboard. If your browser being open on such site, closing the browser or navigating away from the aggressive web site may help.  If this is the cause, you may be interested in a desktop setting preventing individual processes from grabbing the complete (full desktop) focus.  In KDE for example, this setting can be found under (System-Settings -> Window-behavior -> Focus -> Focus stealing prevention). If you feel really paranoid, I would recommend setting it to High or Extreme.  Of course, this may also prevent gnome-ssh-askpass itself from grabbing the keyboard, or more accurately: grabbing the X focus.\nStep #2: Identify suspicious processes:\nKnowing that in Unix, devices appear like files under /dev, the next question is what device represents \"the keyboard\" in the file-system hierarchy. We can use the lsof (list open files) utility for this.\n# look for processes holding devices open, filter out some common ones:\n$ sudo lsof | grep /dev | grep -vE '/(null|urandom|zero)'\n\nNotice that most of the processes holding devices open in a typical desktop env are holding /dev/pts/<N> (a pseudo tty) open. These are the \"devices\" of interest.\nSome background on what's going on here:\nIn a typical Linux graphical desktop, processes don't talk to the keyboard directly. Instead the X program (Xorg) controls all the keyboard events via a device /dev/input/event<N>. X uses an event handler (evdev) which among other things, handles keyboard events.  You can also verify this by looking at the X log: /var/log/Xorg.0.log where keyboard is mentioned.\nThe keyboard events are forwarded from the X event handler to the process that has the mouse pointer focus at any time via the process standard-input which is open on /dev/pts/<N>. Strictly speaking: a process doesn't actually \"grab the keyboard\", the keyboard is held by X, the process only has (or grabs) \"focus\" or the attention of X so X can forward keyboard events to it via an open stdin file descriptor on /dev/pts/<N>.\n\nStep #3: which process has the Xorg focus at any particular time?\nHow to figure which process has the focus at any particular time? Here's a askubuntu question answering this:\n\nfind out the application under the mouse\n\nThe summary of the answer is to run a script like the following in a terminal while navigating around with the mouse:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Print the process tree of the window currently in focus.\n# prereqs:\n#   sudo apt-get install xdotool psmisc\n\nwhile true; do\n   pstree -spaul $(xdotool getwindowpid \"$(xdotool getwindowfocus)\")\n   sleep 2\ndone\n\nStep #4: dig deeper into process activity\nOnce you have a suspect process identified, the last step is to investigate this individual process. For that you may turn to the Linux /proc filesystem (man 5 proc).\nAlmost anything you may want to know about a process is available under /proc.  In fact, programs like lsof (list open files), debuggers which examine process state, and process-listing utilities like ps or top, all rely on /proc, which is populated by the kernel, for data.\nUsing proc you can find where the process executable program is on disk (e.g. any program outside the standard system directories, especially if it is trying to hide under a \"don't pay attention to me\" kind of name, may be suspect) and using a debugger or system call tracer you can examine what exactly are they doing on the system call level (even if you don't have their source code).\nSteps #2 and #3 should give you all the process-IDs (PIDs) that can potentially be reading your keyboard. For each of these PIDS (let's denote each one as $pid) you may:\nMap $pid to its full command line:\ncat /proc/$pid/cmdline\n\nMap $pid to its on disk executable:\nls -l /proc/$pid/exe\n\nMap $pid to its current working directory:\nls -l /proc/$pid/cwd\n\nMap $pid to its original environment\ncat /proc/$pid/environ | tr '\\000' '\\012'\n\nTrace $pid (and its children-procs) system-call activity in real-time:\nstrace -f -p $pid\n\n(There's more: see man 5 proc)\nIf you see an unfamiliar process that reacts to every key-press by storing it into a file (via write) or sending it over the network to via sendto, you may have found a keyboard sniffer.\nYou can also check which processes have (tcp+udp) network endpoints open:\n# See 'man netstat' for details on all options used below\n$ sudo netstat -tunapee\n\nBottom line:\nThe most likely cause for the error is not malware, but multiple processes trying to get keyboard control at the same time. One of the two is gnome-ssh-askpass (the one printing the error). The other may be an open browser on a site with an aggressive focus-acquiring dialog box.\nEven in the remote chance that you actually have some malware installed, the good news is that since you're on Linux, all processes are transparent for you to research and inspect. It would be very hard for malware to really hide from you, or to prevent you from easily locating it using the above techniques, killing its processes, and removing all its files.\n\nA: My issue was due two concurrent gnome-ssh-askpass windows. I had two rsync jobs to the same server through SSH, and both tried to ask for the password of the SSH certificate. Grouping (and chaining) them together solved for me!\n\nA: As arielf mentioned in their excellent answer, there's probably some focus race happening between harmless processes.

(Ubuntu 15.10) I have a little problem with a wacoom bamboo pen-touch tablet. The pen tip is broken and is not working, but the eraser works fine.\nMy question is: Is there any method to make the eraser work as pen?\nI installed Photoshop with playonlinux but this software perceives the eraser as an eraser (which is correct), but I want to change this to perceive eraser as pen. \nIs it possible? I've searched for it on google and found some interesting solutions like this one, but nothing works.\n\nA: I have a few solutions for you....\nI would strongly suggest getting a new pen, but here are some ways that might work. First, you should check out this website. This person ran into the same problem as you and was able to take the pen apart to fix it\nhttp://wishidknownthat.blogspot.com/2009/04/fixing-wacom-bamboo-pen.html\nTo answer you question though, yes, it would be possible to set up the eraser as your First, get the output of:\n\nxsetwacom --list devices \n\nyou should get something like this, but with more devices, since you have a bamboo.\n\nWacom Intuos S 2 Pen stylus        id: 13  type: STYLUS\n  Wacom Intuos S 2 Pad pad            id: 14  type: PAD \n\nthis will give you your DEVICE NAME. I DO NOT HAVE A STYLUS WITH AN ERASER, but you will use the device that says type: ERASER\n\nxsetwacom --set \"REPLACE WITH YOUR DEVICE NAME HERE\" Button4 \"2\"\n\nThat should work. Just as explination of what all that means, \"button\" is the side of the pen and buttons on stylus as well. usually, Button1 (or sometimes just Button) will be the tip, Button2 is the button the the side of your pen that is closer to the tip of the stylus. Button3 is the button above Button2. Button 4 should be the eraser. The number after button (in this case \"2\") sybolizes clicks. What i mean by that is:\n2= Left click/Primary click (pen)\n3= Right click (eraser)\nSo if you get something like parameter \"Button4\" does not exist, just keep changing the number until it works. This is what I had to do except mine was flipped (pen tip acted as eraser). The whole process was copious amounts of trial and error. If you try that and it still doesn't work, tell me and I will continue to help you.\nBest of luck,\nCaroline\n", "Q: Birghtness control not working on Ubuntu 14.04 on MacBook Pro I have Ubuntu 14.04 on MacBook Pro and I cant alter the brightness from System Settings (no option there).

Shells can be login as those run by the text console and non-login as those run by Gnome Terminal. Why is this complexity needed? Why can't a login shell follow the same rules as the non-login?\n\nA: First, have a look at this answer to understand the differences between login and non-login shells. Basically, they read different initialization files. Now, many distributions—including Debian and, by extension, Ubuntu—are actually moving towards what you describe. On these distributions, the default ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile files contain something like the following:\n[[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] && . ~/.bashrc\n\nThat means that login shells—which read ~/.profile—will also read ~/.bashrc, making them behave like non-login interactive shells. Or, rather, making them have the same setup as non-login interactive shells in addition to whatever is set up for login shells. \nThere are, however, perfectly good reasons to have the two behave differently. For example, it is very common to have a machine that you access either by sitting down in front of it and running a graphical session or remotely, through ssh. In the later case, you would be running a login shell and in the former, you would be opening terminals running non-login shells. \nIn such cases, you may want the non-GUI shells to behave differently. For example, for many years, I had this command in my ~/.bashrc file to disable the audible bell:\nxset b off \n\nSince my .bashrc was only read by interactive, non-login shells, and those were never run graphically, it was an easy way to disable the bell. However, since my distro switched to having ~/.profile source ~/.bashrc, the command was also being executed when I was logging in through ssh, in a non-GUI environment and, since xset requires a running X session, it produced an error. \nMore generally, it is often useful to have login shells behave differently since they are usually used for a different purpose. There may be variables you only want set in one type and not the other, or files you only want read. It is, admittedly, less useful to separate the two on a single user home computer, but consider that Linux was for many years primarily aimed at the server market and having multi user systems is very normal. In such cases, the added complexity is worth it since it enables you to have fine grained control over how different types of shells behave. \n", "Q: How to install the XDS package on Ubuntu Can some one guide me on installing the XDS package on Ubuntu.

I have found a bug and the developers to whom I reported this bug to want me to send them the VM with the bug. They want me to send them the password and the VM in its current state (a snapshot). I don't want to give them the password I currently have for the VM, instead I am going to change the password for the VM to something else, and I don't want them to be able to figure out what my old password was.\nSo if I change the sudo password and give them a snapshot of the machine, with access to the machine and the new password is there any way that they could determine the old password? The machine is an installation of Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18 64-bit.\nI'm basically just wanting to know if it is still stored somewhere or something, and whether I'd be safer just doing a fresh install with a password I don't mind giving away, or whether once the password is changed, the old one can't be recovered and thus it doesn't matter if I just send them a snapshot with a new password.\n\nA: No, the password is only stored in /etc/shadow and, even there, it is stored salted hash. This means that even if they have the original password hash, it is very very hard to get the actual password from it. You would have to brute force it and, if it is even possible, it would take a long time and far more resources than anyone would be willing to expend just to get some random panda's password.   \nIn any case, when you change your password, the entry in /etc/shadow is changed and no trace of the original password remains. \nYou should, perhaps, check through your shell's history and make sure you never entered the password in plain text there:\n history | grep yourPassword\n\nYou could also, for your peace of mind, run a full search on all files on the virtual drive:\n find / -type f -exec grep -l \"yourPassword\" {} +\n\n\nMind the space in front of the commands. That makes it so that the commands are NOT added to history. \n\nA: You are better off creating a fresh VM, recreating the bug, then send that fresh copy to the developers, with nothing of value to you in what you send them.  If you consider all the possible places you can get random text strings saved (shell history, auth.log, compressed logs, etc.), you will still have doubts that you thought of them all, or checked throughly enough.  \nexample: Type your password when the username was expected, that gets saved in /var/log/auth.log, old auth.logs are compressed.  What about other logins like ssh?  Confident you got all the operating system places?  Now consider what sort of logging the VM program may be doing.  Far less work to start with a fresh, known clean VM, and duplicate the bug.  Also, the developers will appreciate a known state (fresh install) which displays the bug.\n", "Q: Error while installing pip for python2.7 I get this error while installing pip for python2.7:\n$python get-pip.py\n\nCollecting pip\n  Downloading pip-8.1.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (1.2MB)\n    100% |████████████████████████████████| 1.2MB 294kB/s \nCollecting setuptools\n  Downloading setuptools-20.6.7-py2.py3-none-any.whl (508kB)\n    100% |████████████████████████████████| 512kB 504kB/s \nCollecting wheel\n  Downloading wheel-0.29.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (66kB)\n    100% |████████████████████████████████| 71kB 403kB/s \nInstalling collected packages: pip, setuptools, wheel\nException:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/tmpCmiLCu/pip.zip/pip/basecommand.py\", line 209, in main\n    status = self.run(options, args)\n  File \"/tmp/tmpCmiLCu/pip.zip/pip/commands/install.py\", line 317, in run\n    prefix=options.prefix_path,\n  File \"/tmp/tmpCmiLCu/pip.zip/pip/req/req_set.py\", line 732, in install\n    **kwargs\n  File \"/tmp/tmpCmiLCu/pip.zip/pip/req/req_install.py\", line 835, in install\n    self.move_wheel_files(self.source_dir, root=root, prefix=prefix)\n  File \"/tmp/tmpCmiLCu/pip.zip/pip/req/req_install.py\", line 1030, in move_wheel_files\n    isolated=self.isolated,\n  File \"/tmp/tmpCmiLCu/pip.zip/pip/wheel.py\", line 344, in move_wheel_files\n    clobber(source, lib_dir, True)\n  File \"/tmp/tmpCmiLCu/pip.zip/pip/wheel.py\", line 315, in clobber\n    ensure_dir(destdir)\n  File \"/tmp/tmpCmiLCu/pip.zip/pip/utils/__init__.py\", line 83, in ensure_dir\n    os.makedirs(path)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py\", line 157, in makedirs\n    mkdir(name, mode)\nOSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip'\n\n\nA: The error says permission denied.

It causes tty7 to turn black but it allows the shutdown command to run in tty1.\nNote that ~/.Xauthority belongs to my user, not root.\n\nA: After a lot of digging, it turns out that the NVIDIA driver was to blame for everything. The default NVIDIA proprietary driver that ships with Kubuntu 15.10 has a lot of bugs, especially with newer cards such as GTX 960M. \nThe solution is to add this repo.

It is the NVMe PCI SSD version. The CPU is i7 6600U (Skylake 6th generation) with Intel HD 520.\nAbout a month ago (beginning March 2016), I installed Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 Beta 1. Everything, besides the known issues (Touchpad Physical Button Problems, Lid Close Problems) seemed to work fine.\nAt this time, I was using the kernel version 4.4.0-7. A few days later, there were several kernel updates (4.4.0-12, 4.4.0-14 and 4.4.0-15). Suddenly, I was experiencing screen flickering. It was really ugly, and I couldn't work anymore. So, I did downgrade the kernel version to 4.4.0-7 and put it on hold (via apt-mark hold). The screen flickering disappeared. Now, I have some graphic artifacts when browsing (firefox, chromium). I think I managed to get rid of these by disabling \"smooth scrolling\" options.\nIs anyone else experiencing similar issues? Or has anyone already found a solution to this problem?\nPS: I was installing Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 Final Beta a few days ago and get to try kernel version 4.4.0-16, which has solved the issue with the physical buttons of the touchpad. But unfortunately, the Screen Flickering was not solved. So, I went back to kernel version 4.4.0-7, as described above, again.\n\nA: UPDATE: Yesterday, I freshly installed Ubuntu GNOME 16.04. It came with an up to date kernel version: 4.4.0-18. It seems to have solved the Screen Flickering issue for me (at least until now). Aditionally, the physical buttons of the touchpad work as intended (i.e. scrolling and drag & drop are working). There seems to be some Screen Tearing in web browsers (firefox and chromium). But it really is not comparable to the Screen Flickering issue before. In firefox, I managed to get rid off the Screen Tearing by disabling \"smooth scrolling\" option. Unfortunately, the same procedure doesn't seem to help in chromium.\n\nA: I had this issue on my new Lenovo X1 Carbon running stock 16.04 (4.4.0-33 kernel, Skylake GT2 graphics). I tried two of the answers above (basicdays and Mike O'Connell's) but neither worked. The former caused the graphics to be unusably slow; the latter failed to initialise the graphics at all.\nIn the end I solved the problem by the other method mentioned here, that is: I removed the problematic Intel-specific graphics driver. All seems good so far - no flickering in Chrome and some glitchy behaviour in other apps seems to have gone away too.\nIn short, run this and then reboot and all should be good:\nsudo apt-get purge xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\n\nA: Try:\nSwitching the intel driver from SNA to UXA helped me quite a bit (on a dell skylake here). \nSection \"Device\"\n   Identifier  \"Intel Graphics\"\n   Driver      \"intel\"\n   Option      \"AccelMethod\"  \"uxa\"\nEndSection\n\nAdd this to xorg config by adding to a file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\n\nA: @brianjcohen led me in the right direction. The Bug report on chromium had some good discussions on some background on the issue, but apparently it's somewhat of an x.org issue with Intel driver options. You can reference it here if you'd like:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=606152#c63\nTo fix it, create or edit the file at /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf as root with the following:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"Intel Graphics\"\n    Driver \"intel\"\n    Option \"AccelMethod\" \"sna\"\n    Option \"TearFree\" \"true\"\n    Option \"DRI\" \"3\"\nEndSection\n\n\n\n*\n\n*From the discussion, the AccelMethod should by default be sna, but   apparently not explicitly setting it as such could cause X to crash. sna is definitely faster than downgrading it to uxa.\n\n*TearFree helps prevent tears in video rendering\n\n*DRI is a method on how the driver renders things, I think this was the key option. You can find out a whole bunch on what it is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Infrastructure#DRI3\n\n*You can also read the man page at man 4 intel\n\nA: An user from reddit reported that kernel 4.6.0-994-generic from the Intel DRM branch ( http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/drm-intel-nightly/current/ ) fixed his screen flickering.\n\nA: I'm not 100% certain this is the same issue everyone else is having. But the issue I had (Lenovo T460s, Skylake running 16.04) was that I would experience single-frame flickering and occasional tearing in Google Chrome, especially if video or animated effects were on the page. The problem was not reproducible in Firefox.  I was able to resolve the issue by starting Chrome with --disable-gpu-driver-bug-workarounds --enable-native-gpu-memory-buffers, followed by resetting all experimental flags to default by going to chrome://flags. The explanation, I believe, is that by default (and I'm not sure if this is Ubuntu-specific or not) there are, as the flag implies, workarounds to known GPU bugs enabled, and I think these workarounds are no longer necessary and are actually counterproductive. \nMore info here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=606152\nTo add these startup switches to my Chrome launcher I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Dash and type 'chrome'.\n\n*Drag the Chrome icon to any folder (I used my home folder)\n\n*Right click the icon in my home folder and click Properties\n\n*In the Command box, add the switches after \"%U\".\n\n*Drag the Chrome icon to my launcher to lock it there.\n\n\nEdit: I'm running 4.4.0-22.39, and I have not tried this on any other kernel releases.\n\nA: I did find the following kernel boot parameters to try since they affect screen flicker after trying some of the noted Xorg fixes (either):\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable RC6 sleep modes: i915.enable_rc6=0 OR\n\n*Disable Panel Self Refresh i915.enable_psr=0\nMore information here .\nTo add these, create and edit /etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf with\noptions i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 i915.enable_psr=0\n\nor try\noptions i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 i915.enable_rc6=0\n\nI then restarted to make use of these new module options and tested for flicker by sleep/wake cycles.  None seemed to help.  As for 16.10, the i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 portion may not be necessary.\n\nA: I had the same problem an I ended up disabling tlp in /etc/default/tlp.\nchanging TLP_ENABLE=1 to TLP_ENABLE=0.\nIt looks like power management causes the flickering.\nthis solution may affect your battery life.\n\nA: Here's what I had to do to eliminate screen tearing and flickering in my Ubuntu 16.04:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel libva-intel-vaapi-driver\n\nCreate and edit ~/.drirc:\n<device screen=\"0\" driver=\"dri2\">\n    <application name=\"Default\">\n    <option name=\"vblank_mode\" value=\"0\"/>\n    </application>\n </device>\n\nCreate and edit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf:\nSection \"Device\"\n  Identifier \"Intel Graphics\"\n  Driver     \"intel\"\n  Option     \"AccelMethod\" \"sna\"\n  Option     \"TearFree\" \"true\"\n  Option     \"DRI\" \"3\"\nEndSection\n\nThe above almost does the trick. However, there is a persistent Kernel bug in recent Kernel versions (up from 4.0 until the latest 4.8), which produces flickering exactly like in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqAljJ0U5Pc.\nHowever, if you use a really old kernel the flickering stops.\nDownload and install an old kernel:\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.13.11.11-trusty/linux-image-3.13.11-03131111-generic_3.13.11-03131111.201411111336_amd64.deb\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.13.11.11-trusty/linux-headers-3.13.11-03131111_3.13.11-03131111.201411111336_all.deb\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.13.11.11-trusty/linux-headers-3.13.11-03131111-generic_3.13.11-03131111.201411111336_amd64.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.13.11-03131111_3.13.11-03131111.201411111336_all.deb linux-headers-3.13.11-03131111-generic_3.13.11-03131111.201411111336_amd64.deb linux-image-3.13.11-03131111-generic_3.13.11-03131111.201411111336_amd64.deb\n\nLast thing to do is to make the above kernel the default one.\nEdit /etc/default/grub and change/add the following line:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 3.13.11-03131111-generic\"\n\nAnd finally, update grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: I also had the same problem on a Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro running 16.04 + Gnome Shell.\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_NNn1S_nX8\nThe screen flashing would occur after 10 minutes sometimes, or 2 hours other times. It would stop while the mouse was moving, and I was able to temporarily stop it for maybe an hour or so by switching consoles via ctrl-alt-f1. I've tried everything in this thread with no success, however I came across a bug report which mentioned changing kernels to 4.4.0-040400. I'm 12 hours in since the kernel downgrade from 4.6, and the flickering is gone!\nThis is the kernel I used. Simply install these, and uninstall the old kernel.\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4-wily/\n\nA: kernel 4.6.0-994-generic, from the link posted by Massimiliano fixed the problem for me. \nI have an Acer Chromebook with a i5-5200U processor. The symptom was hat I was getting flicker when first booted up the laptop. I would have to close and open the lid a few times to fix the problem. \nSince I installed 4.6.0-994-generic it works OK.\n\nA: I have just upgraded to 16.04 from 15.10 on a Dell inspiron 3000 with nvidia geforce graphics. There was very annoying flickering. The thing that fixed it for me was to change the default screen brightness. Brighter or lower fixed it. Going back to the default level brought the flickering back.\n\nA: I had the same Problem on a XPS 13 9350. (Kernel 4.4.0-22-generic)\nI dont now what the Problem is. I think It starts after installing Skype?! It was not flickering after installing ubuntu. it starts a few days later and i think it starts after installing skype? But I´m not sure ;-(\ninstalling the latest kernel (4.6.0-040600-generic) fixed the Problem.\nhere is a easy way to install the latest kernel version: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CokrHUykkUQ\nthanks by Massimiliano he brings the best tip!!!\n\nA: I was facing the same problem here with my Dell XPS13 Intel® HD Graphics 520 (Skylake GT2). I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and I just solved this problem in System Settings -> Software & Updates -> Additional Drivers, enabling the ' Using Processor microcode firmware for intel CPUs from intel-microcode(proprietary)' and then reboot. Hope it works for you as well!\n\nA: Is it the one with the black lines? I have got that same issue on my samsung ultrabook, it only happens at full \"1080P\" resolution on my hdmi port. i've observed that this seems to happen most if the screen is really bright, mainly if there is a white background  like in \"Files or a web browser\" but it seems its not really affected by gpu intensive apps like \"playing 1080p movies\" only the color or brightness sets it seems to set it off?\nits not a fix but its a workaround until they release an update that fixes the issue.\nSetting the resolution one down from full 1080p seems to stop it, you could try that if you still having issues :)\nEDIT: Also try the kernel 4.8.10 This is the \"only\" kernel that permanently fix the black lines at 1080P for me with an intel HD4000 HDMI output, all other releases seem to have undone that fix from that one on, even 4.9 doesn't fix it. Use the ubuntu kernel update utility to give it a shot \"Ukuu\" i think its called?\n\nA: Have had the same problem testing Mint 18 on Samsung 9, i7-6500u.\nConsistent with the poster above who solved it by turning off tlp, I found the flickering only occurs when I use powertop to select:\n\"Autosuspend for unknown USB device 1-5 (8087:0a2b)\nfrom \"bad\" to \"good\", i.e. turning on this autosuspend with \"good\" causes flickering, \"bad\" does not.\nWith this left to \"bad\" my display is stable.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, and reached this thread seeking a solution.\nWhile upgrading the kernel to 4.8 improved the situation, what solved it for me was installing Intel Graphics for Linux drivers:\nhttps://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads\nNote that for Ubuntu 16.04, you need v2.0.2 and not the latest (currently v2.0.3)\nhttps://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/intel-graphics-update-tool-linux-os-v2.0.2\n\nA: For anyone else having similar problems with more recent installs; \nI'm running a fresh 20.04 LTS (ubuntu unity remix) on ThinkPad x260 (skylake i7-6500U / GT2 HD graphics 520) - 5.4.0-31-generic kernel.\nSymptoms typically involved titlebars of inactive windows flickering when the mouse was moving, or seemingly if the gpu was being called to redraw the screen content. Worst case scenario was watching a video, switching it to fullscreen, then switching it back to smaller fraction of the display. This would cause all the area outside of the still playing video to flicker intensely.\nNo solutions worked, from attempting to disable compositor to disabling hardware acceleration etc. until I tried basicdays answer.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/796808/711096 \nThis cleared it up after a reboot and have not seen a single graphical glitch since, nor any loss of performance at all.

The size of the document is 78.7 KB.\nSeems like a memory leak. Are there anyone who face this issue? If so, any workarounds are appreciated.\nHere is the proof of this issue:\n\nps. My OS is Using 14.04.\n\nA: The memory that is listed in your table is very likely the virtual memory of the soffice.bin. \nIf you run top, you can see the virtual memory use (VIRT) and the resident set size (RSS) of system processes. The resident set size is the non-swapped physical memory used by each process, minus a small amount of overhead. So it will give you a decent idea of actual memory usage. \nVIRT or VSZ (Virtual Set Size) is the memory size assigned to a process during the initial execution. The Virtual Set Size memory is simply a number of how much memory a process has available for its execution. \nIf you don't have top installed, you can run:  \nps ax -o rss,vsize,command|sort -nr|head -n 10\n\nthis will give you the 10 most memory hungry processes. The first column printed is RSS and the second column is VIRT. If soffice.bin is in the list, it's VIRT should match what is in your table. \nReferences:\n- http://www.unixlore.net/articles/quick-easy-way-monitor-process-memory-usage.html\n- https://serverfault.com/q/48582\n- https://linuxconfig.org/ps-output-difference-between-vsz-vs-rss-memory-usage\n- man ps\n", "Q: How to get \"Epson Printer Utility\" to start from Launcher in Ubuntu?

The last time something similar appeared to me I solved installing bumblebee for my nvidia graphic card.\n\nA: It's not a black screen, it's running fsck. (file system consistency checker). It's normal for a computer to fsck itself on every boot. It's usually with a regular fsck but sometimes (I can't remember how often, I think it's like every 20 boots) it runs a full fsck, which is more thorough but takes longer.\nNote DO NOT type any of those commands in terminal (with sudo).

By freeze I mean everything hangs and there is absolutely nothing that can be done except reset.\nI've read lots of threads, which date up to a year ago, about this problem , so this has been going for quite some time. The suggestion I found is to go to the BIOS and set C1 as the max state or to put some \"intel_idle.max_cstate=1\" line somewhere, which does the same thing.\nThe problem is that this is not a fix. Disabling CPU features isn't a way to solve problems. I bought this machine for a low power server and disabling power saving features is the last thing I would want to do.

If you are familiar with using the terminal, I would recommend you cd into the directory where your second hard drive is located. You can them enter mkdir [NAME IT WHATEVER YOU WANT] to create the directory (directory means the same thing as a folder.) \nIf you are unfamiliar with the terminal, you can use nautilus (ubuntu's default file manager) to create a new folder.

I'm able to use Firefox to browse the web inside the guest, however I'm unable to use apt on the terminal.\nWhenever i invoke the command sudo apt-get update, it gets stuck at 0% [connecting to in.archive.ubuntu.com], finally failing. Also, using sudo apt-get install <package> always results in the package not even being found.\nOn the other hand, using the same commands with the -E flag on sudo makes them work.\nCan somebody explain what's happening here?\nEDIT: I forgot to add that i'm using multiple internet connections; one with proxy and one without. Regular sudo works on the one without proxy but not on the one with it.\n\nA: The magic word here is proxy. In your environment you will have proxy information set that allows you to access the internet.\nThe environment variable http_proxy contains your proxy settings.\nExecute echo $http_proxy to see them (maybe $HTTP_PROXY). \nIf you run sudo <command>, the command will be executed in its own environment as root. If you add the -E option to sudo, the command will be executed as root, but with most of your environment copied over.\nYou can check that by executing the following three commands:  \n\n\n*\n\n*env  \n\n*sudo env  \n\n*sudo -E env\n", "Q: Problem installing ubuntu 15.10 alongside windows 8.1 on HP 15-ab035AX I have HP 15-ab035AX pavilion series laptop with window 8.1, 64 bit.

Namely xedus.sytes.net. It's called DNS hijacking and domain name registrars and isps often do it. \nYou could block the ip address it directs you to with\niptables. That way you wont get any packets from them and the ping should fail.\n iptables -A INPUT -s 37.220.180.119 -j DROP\n\nDon't do that if you ever actually use the server that's redirecting you. (you said \"local server\" so I'm not sure) It's a primitive solution, instead people use things like dd-wrt to prevent DNS hijacking. http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index \n", "Q: Unable to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 I've burnt Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS 64-bit on DVD-R by Infra Recorder, and created a live USB of 15.10 64-bit using Universal USB Installer.\nThen I tried installing Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS 64-bit, or Ubuntu 15.10 64-bit alongside windows 10, but I keep getting these errors:\n\nWith no parameter nomodeset (transcribed from video given in original post):\n[  0.033675] Ignoring BGRT: Invalid status 0 (expected 1)\n[  3.205412] nouveau E[ PGRAPH][0000:01:00.0] failed to load fuc409c\n[  3.211068] nouveau E[  PFIFO][0000:01:00.0] unsupported engines 0x00000001\n[  3.211138] nouveau E[    DRM] failed to create kernel channel, -22\n[ 34.856110] ata8.00: exception Emask 0x52 SAct 0x0 SErr 0xffffffff action 0xe frozen\n[ 34.856130] ata8: SError: { RecovComm UnrecovData Persist Proto HostInt PHYRdyChg PHYInt CommWake 10B8B Dispar BadCRC Handshk LinkSeq TrStaTrns UnrecFIS DevExch }\n[ 34.856164] ata8.00: failed command:IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE\n[ 34.856178] ata8.00: cmd a1/00:01:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 tag 2 pio 512 in\n[ 34.856178]          res 40/00:03:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/a0 Emask 0x56 (ATA bus error)\n[ 34.856209] ata8.00: status: { DRDY }\n\n\nWith parameter nouveau.modeset=0 or nomodeset: (transcribed from video:\n[  0.033675] Ignoring BGRT: Invalid status 0 (expected 1)\n[ 34.856110] ata8.00: exception Emask 0x52 SAct 0x0 SErr 0xffffffff action 0xe frozen\n[ 34.856130] ata8: SError: { RecovComm UnrecovData Persist Proto HostInt PHYRdyChg PHYInt CommWake 10B8B Dispar BadCRC Handshk LinkSeq TrStaTrns UnrecFIS DevExch }\n[ 34.856164] ata8.00: failed command:IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE\n[ 34.856178] ata8.00: cmd a1/00:01:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 tag 2 pio 512 in\n[ 34.856178]          res 40/00:03:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/a0 Emask 0x56 (ATA bus error)\n[ 34.856209] ata8.00: status: { DRDY }\n\n\nMy PC specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*MOBO: Asus Z97-Pro\n\n*CPU: Intel i7 4790K\n\n*GPU: Asus GTX970 Strix\n\n\nA: You should try to use nouveau.modeset=0 instead nomodeset.\nThe issue that you have is a kind of incompatibility between nouveau open source driver and some Nvidia graphic cards.\nI've got the same problem with a PC with a Nvidia GTX950M: nomodeset didn't work, but nouveau.modeset=0 worked.\nP.S. once you have installed Ubuntu, to keep things working, you have to add nouveau.modeset=0 to grub configuration file or blacklist nouveau driver.\nMy solution that solved my problem:\nchange grub configuration file opening it as administrator:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nadd nouveau.modeset=0 to the following line as showed:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nouveau.modeset=0\"\n\nthen save with ctrl+o and exit with ctrl-x.

Use the \"Try Ubuntu\" button and load the Live Image.  Once loaded run the partition editor (GParted).  From here you can delete the current partitions; don't create any new partitions.  Restart the computer, but this time you should install Ubuntu - again, following the prompts.  At the disk partition request select \"Use the whole (full?) disk\" and also the LVM option.

How can that be? \nthank you, if anyone has found a better workaround I would be very grateful to know \nI have been reading here and on forums for hours now but I still can't find a definitive solution\n\nA: The driver parameter ant_sel is to select one or the other of two antenna connections.

A while ago, I've tested the Global Sat BU-353-S4 gps receiver on Windows 7 and worked well when tested with software that used it. \nAt the same time, it did not work on Ubuntu, followed many tutorials. In the end I did \"sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0\" and it works fine, except that when using navit, there is a delay of about 10 seconds from the position navit process and my actual position(when driving).\nNow, back to Windows 7 and the receiver does not work at all. The xgps binary that came with the drivers just shows some red text. When it used to work, it showed black text. It did complain about the drivers at one point, but even after reinstalling them, it still did not work. Initially I thought GPS Gate might have wrecked the drivers. I uninstalled GPS Gate as well.\nSo, after giving access to the driver file, could it be that gpsd has modified the firmware? Is there a way to restore it to default?\nNot entirely sure if the receiver has just broken during this period or not... \n\nA: Prior to setting the -b flag in /etc/defauls/gpsd\n# Default settings for gpsd.\n# Please do not edit this file directly - use `dpkg-reconfigure gpsd' to\n# change the options.\nSTART_DAEMON=\"true\"\nGPSD_OPTIONS=\"-n -G -b\"\nDEVICES=\"\"\nUSBAUTO=\"true\"\nGPSD_SOCKET=\"/var/run/gpsd.sock\"\n\nThe -b flag is:\n\nBroken-device-safety mode, otherwise known as read-only mode.

After a successful install, I can't seem to boot into the OS. There's a blinking cursor on the screen and that's it. I used a LiveCD to try repairing it using boot repair but that also didn't help. Also tried disabling SecureBoot in BIOS: There wasn't any option like that in my BIOS.\nThe boot repair report is here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/15585301/.\nI'm new to Linux so I'm not sure what I might be doing wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated\n\nA: You've clearly got an EFI-mode installation. That's fine, and helps identify the problem, which I believe is this:\n=================== efibootmgr -v\nTimeout: 10 seconds\nNo BootOrder is set; firmware will attempt recovery\n\nOrdinarily, the EFI BootOrder variable tells the firmware what OS to boot. It's not set on your computer, though, so it can't tell what to boot. What brand and model computer do you have? I've got an older HP laptop (a ProBook 6470b) that's got a broken firmware that can't accept this variable. The solution is to copy the boot loader file to the fallback filename of EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi.\nOne complication is that you've already got a file of this name; however, because the name is fixed and Boot Repair doesn't try to identify programs' contents, it's not clear what this file is in your case. Whatever it is, though, it's not doing anything useful. Thus, I recommend you replace it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to an emergency system (whatever you used to run Boot Repair will probably work).\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Mount the ESP (/dev/sda1) someplace convenient. For instance, sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt will mount it at /mnt.\n\n*Change to the EFI directory on the ESP (cd /mnt/EFI).\n\n*Rename the current Boot directory, as in mv Boot Boot-old. (Note that the ESP uses FAT, which is case-insensitive.)\n\n*Copy the entire ubuntu subdirectory to BOOT, as in sudo cp -r ubuntu BOOT.\n\n*Rename shimx64.efi in BOOT to bootx64.efi, as in sudo mv BOOT/shimx64.efi BOOT/bootx64.efi.\n\n*Verify that what should be present is by typing ls /mnt/EFI/BOOT. You should see several files, including bootx64.efi and grubx64.efi.\n\n*Reboot. With any luck, the computer will boot normally.\n\n\nAs a side note, this sort of problem was common in early EFI implementations (from 2012 and earlier). This problem should not exist in more recent computers. If the computer is new, I STRONGLY recommend you return it to the store for a refund and get something else, since any computer with such an egregious problem is badly broken, and you don't know what else might be equally badly broken. Even if everything else is fine, maintaining a boot loader like this will be an ongoing hassle for the rest of the life of the computer.\n", "Q: Run Counter Strike in Ubuntu 15.10 I'm a huge fan of Counter Strike.

After that, I created a partition with GParted and then I tried to install Windows 7 along with Ubuntu. The thing is that I had to use Window's Diskpart tool in order to make the new partition available for Windows. No luck at all: the partition wasn't recognized either. So I reboot the system and tried to boot it up with UEFI in secure mode, and now it doesn't boot at all.\nAll it does now is to barely show the Dell logo and then it goes black screen, and after a minute it buzzes a strange noise.

I just pressed FN + F11 whilst booting, so the screen's output is redirected back to the laptop's LCD, rather to an external display device. After that, hit F12 to enter the boot options and make it start from either UEFI or legacy mode, but ALWAYS with secure mode off.\n\nA: Keep UEFI on and Secure boot off to boot into ubuntu, it doesn't boot with secure boot because, secure boot doesn't allow ubuntu to install unsigned driver's and other necessary files. \n", "Q: Accidental 'sudo grub-install' I accidentally executed:\nsudo grub-install\n\nNow I don't want to restart the PC, because I'm afraid it might not boot.

But at shut down, it is unmounted and you'd have to manually mount again after restarting. You can make the mount permanent through /etc/fstab.\nAssuming that your /dev/sda6 is a partition of your hard drive and that it has an ext4 filesystem on it, you can use these steps to permanently put your home directory on it. Make sure to also check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving.\nI'm using the command line for all steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the UUID of /dev/sda6:\nsudo blkid\n\nWhy UUID? In Ubuntu, it is now best practice to use the device's UUID instead of it's name, because the UUID is truly unique and won't change.\n\n\n*Make a backup copy of the file /etc/fstab:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.ori\n\nYou can compare the copy and the original to make sure you have a correct backup:\n    sudo cmp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.ori # should show no output\n\n\n\n*Open /etc/fstab in an editor. I'll use nano. Use Ctrl+O (the letter, not the number) to save changes and use Ctrl+X to exit.\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nAdd the following line to the bottom. Replace [UUID] with the UUID of your device (copy the string with the dashes, but without the quotes).\n    UUID=[UUID]    /media/home    ext4    defaults    0    2\n\nSave and exit.\n4. Create the mount point and then remount everything that is in /etc/fstab:\n    sudo mkdir /media/home\n    sudo mount -a\n\nThis will mount your /dev/sda6 device on /media/home.\n5. We'll now copy the contents of the current home directory to /dev/sda6. Using rsync with the -avz flags makes sure that metadata like file ownership and times are copied as well. The diff command checks if all files copied correctly, it should show difference in .bash_history only.\n    sudo rsync -avz /home/ /media/home/\n    sudo diff -r /home /media/home\n\n\n\n*Change the mount point of your /dev/sda6 device to /home in /etc/fstab (open with sudo nano):\nUUID=[UUID]    /home    ext4    defaults    0    2\n\n\n*We'll now move the current home directory away and create a new, empty home directory. After remounting your /dev/sda6 device is mounted on /home and also automatically mounted at boot. Everything in /home is now on your /dev/sda6 device.\nsudo mv /home /old_home\nsudo mkdir /home\nsudo mount -a\n\nAfter you have made sure everything is in place you can remove the old home with:\n    sudo rm -rf /old_home\n\nDone!\n", "Q: How can I install brasero in Ubuntu 16.04?

The firmware looks for a boot loader of a particular type (BIOS vs. EFI) based on its own capabilities, settings, and algorithms. If it finds an appropriate boot loader, it runs it. If not, it may fall back and look for a boot loader of another type, or the boot process may fail.\nBoot loaders are written for a particular firmware type (BIOS vs. EFI vs. more exotic things), so you can't use a BIOS-mode boot loader in an EFI-mode boot or vice-versa. By the time the boot loader is launched, the boot mode is determined. (rEFIt and rEFInd are partial exceptions; they're EFI-mode boot managers that can redirect to BIOS-mode boot. They still rely on BIOS-mode boot loaders to do this, though.)\nAlso, BIOS and EFI boot loaders are installed in entirely different ways, which makes it possible for a boot medium (CD, USB flash drive, or internal hard disk) to support both types of boot loader. Configured in this way, a disk may be booted on either a BIOS-mode computer or an EFI-mode computer. That's how Ubuntu installation media are designed (at least, for 64-bit versions of Ubuntu).\nBeyond the boot loader, there's nothing in Ubuntu that's so boot-mode-specific that it won't work in the other boot mode. Thus, you can install Ubuntu in BIOS mode and then use an EFI-mode boot loader to boot that installation, or vice-versa. (There are a few EFI-specific tools, like efibootmgr, but they aren't required to boot the computer in EFI mode, and they don't prevent a BIOS-mode boot if they're installed.)\nThus, as a practical matter, what you want to do is to install in one mode and then install a boot loader for the other mode in addition to the original boot loader. You can do this in either order. A few complications include:\n\n\n*\n\n*MBR vs. GPT -- Ubuntu uses the MBR partition table by default for BIOS-mode installs and GPT by default for EFI-mode installs. It's usually possible to cross partition table types and boot modes (MBR/EFI and GPT/BIOS), but there are subtle complications possible. Personally, I'd go with GPT, but this will necessitate creating a ~1MiB BIOS Boot Partition on the disk, and you must be aware of this need.\n\n*EFI boot loader filename -- If you install Ubuntu in EFI mode or use automated scripts to install a boot loader after the fact, it will probably put the boot loader in EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi or something similar, and register that filename with the NVRAM. This works fine for a regular installation to a hard disk. To make a \"generically\" bootable external EFI medium, you must instead install the boot loader as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi, which is a \"fallback\" filename that the firmware will attempt if it can't find something else or if you explicitly tell it to boot from an external medium. Setting up in this way will require using special boot loader installation options or manual setup after the fact.\n\n*Boot loader selection -- Installing on an external disk to be moved from computer to computer is tricky enough for one boot mode. Adding a second creates a complication if you use GRUB: The GRUB configuration files must be slightly different for each boot mode. Thus, you must either \"dive deep\" into GRUB configuration or use two different boot loaders -- say, GRUB for BIOS and rEFInd for EFI; or LILO for BIOS and GRUB for EFI.\n\n*Secure Boot -- Some, but not all, EFIs support Secure Boot. Some, but not all, of these EFIs have Secure Boot enabled. Most, but not all, of these computers use Microsoft's Secure Boot keys. If Secure Boot is enabled, only boot loaders signed with an installed key will be bootable. Knowing the systems to which you want to deploy will help you decide how to set up the EFI side of the boot loader. For instance, if you want to be able to boot on any random Windows system with minimal fuss, you'll want a signed EFI boot loader, which normally means GRUB for EFI. If, OTOH, you know that most of your targets don't use Secure Boot, or if you don't mind jumping through some extra hoops the first time you boot one of these computers, you can use something else.\n\n\nPersonally, to do this I would prepare the external medium with GPT and all partitions (including both a BIOS Boot Partition and an EFI System Partition, or ESP) before installing, then install in BIOS mode and use Ubuntu's features to ensure that GRUB is installed. With that done, I'd manually install my own rEFInd to the ESP as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi (the fallback filename). The result will be a system that will boot in either BIOS mode or EFI mode. One complication of this approach is Secure Boot; the rEFInd binaries are not signed in such a way that they'll boot directly on most computers, so you'll need to add Shim or PreLoader to the mix, as described on rEFInd's Secure Boot page. This may be a big enough complication that it would be better to install in EFI mode, including lettering Ubuntu install GRUB. You'd then need to copy Shim and GRUB to work using the fallback filename and install some other BIOS-mode boot loader.\nSome additional reading on EFI-mode booting may be helpful.

Is it possible at all to force a specific DPI settings in Ubuntu Xenial?\nRecipes mentioned in Can I pass a dpi flag to lightdm to set the proper DPI for X? don't work anymore:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can successfully pass -dpi... option to X server,\n\n*I do see in Xorg.0.log that X server uses that option (actually without this option it successfully calculated proper DPI from monitor physical dimensions),\n\n*but even on the login screen DPI settings are set back to 96, according to xdpyinfo (I've checked this with an xterm, launched from a text console with  proper $DISPLAY and $XAUTHORITY manually set).\n\n\nSo the question is: is changing DPI possible at all? Or should I simply dump off anything related to GNOME (due to this \"WONTFIX\") until more sane developers come to the GNOME team?\n\nA: I can't test on Xenial at the moment, but here's a fix that worked for my DPI-related problem on Trusty when none of the others did.\nProblem: When I rebooted after having to swap out one of my 19\" 1280x1024 monitors for a 17\" 1280x1024 monitor, my fonts were small and looked \"wrong\" (I lack the vocabulary to say more but I assume it had to do with how the anti-aliasing interacted with a bad DPI setting).\nWorse, GTK+ 2.x apps gave the confusing impression that they were ignoring the font size settings. (If I changed the font face or style, applications would update, but not even restarting applications would cause a change from 11pt. to 12pt. or 14pt. to have any visible effect. I didn't test that symptom against GTK+ 3.x though.)\nSolution: The Xft.dpi X11 resource.\nConfirmed effective for: GTK+ 2.x, GTK+ 3.x, and Qt 4 apps\nFor your case, try running this on your system and then restarting your applications:\necho Xft.dpi: 75 | xrdb -merge\n\nNote: You may need to wait and/or restart them twice. When I tested GTK+ 3.x with file-roller and a DPI of 144, it remained on the 144 scale the first time I tested it after setting my DPI back to 96, but quitting and restarting it a second time returned it to the expected scale.\nIf that solves the problem, persist it by adding Xft.dpi: 75 on a line of its own in ~/.Xresources. \nIf it doesn't solve it, try again with other values to make sure you understand what the system is doing with the value you give it. I had to set the DPI to 96 to get the desired scale and that didn't occur to my sleep-fogged mind until I tried 72 DPI and the font shrunk rather than growing.\n(Replacing the failed left-most 19\" monitor with a 17\" monitor was an online replacement and I have KDE's display settings daemon disabled, so what I expected was all three monitors operating on a fixed DPI setting calculated from a 19\" 1280x1024 display.)\nIf the ~/.Xresources version has no effect, your desktop is probably missing the customary call to xrdb to apply them. I typically add xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources as one of the last things to run on login so it doesn't conflict with whatever else the desktop may be trying to accomplish.\n\nA: you can set your dpi directly using xrandr whilst running\nxrandr --output <outputname> --dpi <dpi>\n\nor in the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file \nxserver-command=X -dpi 75\n\nand see that is accepted using \nxdpyinfo | grep resolution\n\nNot all combinations of drivers and screen outputs support DPI scaling , if you can't do it on the command line its unlikely that lightdm will be able to do it.\nYou will also find some applications (particularly older or not native gtk) will not look right at non-standard DPIs and in some cases are totally unusable. This should get better over time as higher dpi screens become the norm.\n", "Q: LOo don't start : Gdk-WARNING **: gdk_window_set_icon_list: icons too large \ncylere@Lalla:~$ uname -a\n  Linux Lalla 3.19.0-25-generic #26-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 24 21:17:31 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\ncylere@Lalla:~$ cat /etc/issue\n  Ubuntu 15.10 \\n \\l\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The command line soffice or loffice lock with no return, necessary to use CTRL+C to exit.\n\n*With icon soffice or writer, a popup with error :\n\n\"Impossible to launch the application.\"\n  Failed to updatefile:///home/cylere/.config/libreoffice/4/user/extensions/bundled/lastsynchronized  \n\nThis file (lastsynchronized) have only the character 1 inside.\n\n\n*\n\n*\nSometime on the terminal\n  (soffice:3567): Gdk-WARNING **: gdk_window_set_icon_list: icons too large\n\nThey are all messages I got, and LibreOffice don't start.\n\nThis appear from some time, but I could use soffice or loffice to start LOo, but after a recent upgrade, nothing works\n\nA: In case it helps - I had the same issue (with the same warning) and solved it by deleting the folder .config/libreoffice.

And I wanted to ask, if there is any way to enter bios to set boot order to as a first priority so I can fix this? Pressing function keys, esc and delete didn't work, so I hope that maybe there is another way. Thank you for your help :)\n\nA: Yes, but not from the GRUB rescue shell. You need to enter the BIOS before GRUB shows up. The details depend on your machine but there should be a message displayed during POST that tells you what key to press to enter \"Setup\". \nThe key is often one of Del, F12 or F2, so try those if you don't see a message. You need to do this before the GRUB screen loads though. \n", "Q: Changing GPUs from AMD to Nvidia: driver question I'm switching my AMD GPU (R9 270X) for an Nvidia GPU (GTX 960 SSC). I currently have Ubuntu 14.04 installed and the proprietary AMD drivers (version 15.12). I'd like to know what is the correct procedure to switch cards. Should I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unninstall the AMD driver, then change the GPU, boot up and install the Nvidia driver?\n\n\nor\n\n\n*Switch the GPU, boot up, unninstall the AMD driver and then install the Nvidia driver?\n\n\nANy help is apreciated, thanks :)\n\nA: First you want to uninstall the AMD Drivers.\nSwap your cards then reboot.\nFor best results with Nvidia you will want to boot into your oldest kernel and install.  If you don't, you may have a hard time booting into older kernels if you ever need to.  Nvidia driver will only install into the kernel you boot and newer kernels, by booting into your old kernels the drivers will install into all kernels.\nYou may need to set the nomodeset option to boot successfully for the first time. This is only necessary if you can only boot to a black screen. If so:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the arrow keys to highlight the kernel you want to boot into\n\n*Press e to edit the boot setting\n\n*In the long lines of text you will see \"quiet splash\" about half down, use the down arrow keys to get to the start of the line then the right arrow key to move past it.\n\n*enter nomodeset just behind \"quiet splash\"\n\n*press F10 to boot into the kernel using the modified settings(this will only affect this boot the settings will return to normal on next boot.\n\n\nNote: according to this answer you should use nouveau.modeset=0 instead of nomodeset on 15.10, no mention is made of 14.04 but 14.04.04 uses the 15.10 graphics stack so you may need to use that setting if nomodeset fails\nI borrowed the following from the linked answer as a copy and paste rather than type it out as it would apply to your card.\nGenerally it is recommended to use the NVIDIA drivers from the official Ubuntu repositories.\nBut as you have very new graphics hardware, you can install the latest official NVIDIA drivers.\nThe xorg-edgers PPA does not provide the drivers anymore and was replaced by GPU Drivers.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-361\nsudo reboot  \n\n\nIf you wish to use the above ppa, install it before installing the Nvidia drivers to prevent a re-install.\nThe driver team is excellent at getting the new builds uploaded within days of release.  The only thing you may need to be cautious of is that the ppa will recommend the newest versions, even if they are betas, in the \"additional drivers\" window so I always keep an eye on the Nvidia page I linked above to see what the current stable release is. I personally tend to avoid beta versions unless I'm trying to fix a bug, however Nvidia's betas tend to be pretty stable so you may wish to use them.\nOne final thought, if you use Steam Source games, Nvidia 361 drivers had a regression that prevented source games from starting.  There is a workaround but it is easier to just stick with the 352 drivers or install the 364 drivers, the ppa currently has 364.12 which is a beta but Nvidia released 364.42 a couple of days ago that are not beta and will be uploaded to the ppa soon(I have noticed no issues with the beta version) see Nvidia's site for more\nAs an aside, some people get tempted to use the drivers directly from Nvidia's website when the run into issues rather than wait for the ppa to be updated, that is strongly advised against, the ppa repacks them so that new kernels do not crash the Nvidia drivers and require a reinstall every time a kernel is updated, it also prevents other possible conflicts as well.  \n", "Q: Juju 2.0 on ubuntu 14.04.1 juju 2.0 not supported on ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS? \nI have added the repository juju/devel and then tried to install juju but its not able to recognize juju-core2\nI have checked that there is recent update on the juju link: https://jujucharms.com/docs/devel/getting-started\nIt appears its supported for Ubuntu, 16.04LTS(Xenial) only?

Using a bootable usb stick i attempt to erase the earlier ubuntu installation, that had since been corrupted. After about a minute the system became completely unresponsive requiring a hard reset (ctrl-alt-f1 and similar solutions do not work). I repartitioned the drive and attempted to reinstall this time closing out all other windows. The installation suceeded, however as soon as I reopened Firefox the system froze  (note, on the previous session Firefox had been running for 3 hours with no issues up until the installation ).\nOnce on the installed ubuntu, the problem began to get worse. Any attempts at installing  (either via the software store or using apt-get) resulted in a freeze, usually five minutes into the installation process, sooner if other programs were open. This is also the case when using the ctrl-alt-f1 terminal.\nWhen not installing programs the system remains functional for around 20 minutes regardless of whether it is under heavy load or just sitting idle. The actual length of time can vary by several minutes, however it will always freeze sooner if something is being installed and will freeze almost immediately if something is being installed while Firefox is open.\nI am using:\nAsus Sabertooth z97 mark 1 with fast boot disabled and secure boot enabled  (it cannot be disabled)\nAn intel i7 4790K (no overclock)\nAn Asus R9 270X (no overclock)\nI have checked the RAM, GPU, and done cursory checks on the HDD, no errors were reported.\nThe Windows drive has also been removed so as not to interfere with the Ubuntu drive (they are on separate hard drives)\nI have no personal data on the system so a full reinstall would be ok.\nOf note: My windows system has also experienced this issue, however it is only present when using Skype and playing certain games simultaneously  (ubuntu has none of these programs installed). Additionally, 90% of the timr Grub does not display any text on boot, i don't know if this is a related problem.\nAny help would be appreciated, apologies for the horrible formatting as I am writing this on a mobile device. \nEdit: using the REISUB  method does not restart the compute. Restarting from REISUB does not prevent the system from freezing. \nEdit 2: After the most recent freeze my secondary monitor (a repurposed tv) glitched out and is now displaying the Ubuntu booting splash screen in the top half of the monitor, and a series of fragmented rainbow patterns, white lines and black bars on the bottom. \n\nA: I have found a temporary \"solution\" to this issue. Switching to windows and updating the firmware of my Corsair K70 (regardless of whether or not there is a firmware update available) will prevent the computer from freezing until the next system update. This has worked consistently for the past four weeks. \nIf anyone knows how I might be able to make this fix permanent I would appreciate it. \n", "Q: How to install tar.gz file?

I am currently trying to setup a desktop icon to Arduino IDE and I don't know enough to properly set it up.  Here's the current setup.\nI have installed Arduino-1.6.7 in a folder by that name in my home folder.  At present, the only way I can run it is to go to the terminal, CD to the \nArduino-1.6.7 folder and then run it with $ ./arduino.  This works but obviously, I would rather run it with a simple icon.  \nI have tried to use this method, but when I browse to /usr/share/applications, there is no icon for Arduino.\nThank you for being part of the village that raises this idiot.\n\nA: Ubuntu has something called a .desktop file, which acts as a shortcut to whichever app you want. You can specify an icon you want, the name of the shortcut, the description that appears when you hover over the shortcut, and a lot of other stuff. It's not the easiest setup, but it's not hard, either. Here's how to do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), and run gedit ~/Desktop/Arduino.desktop.\n\n*In the text editor window that opens, paste this:\n [Desktop Entry]\n Name=Arduino\n Comment=Arduino IDE\n Exec=/path/to/the/arduino/executable\n Path=/path/to/the/arduino_folder/\n Icon=/path/to/arduino/icon.png\n Terminal=false\n Type=Application\n Categories=Utility;Application;Development;\n\n\n*Edit the Exec,Path, and Icon fields to point to the appropriate locations.\n\n*Save the file and close Gedit.\n\n*Now, go to your Desktop folder and test the shortcut bu double-clicking it. If it works, you can drag the icon to your launcher to have it there, as well.\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*You may get a warning when you try to use the .desktop file, telling you it is not trusted, or something similar. If you see this, right click on the file, go to Properties >> Permissions and check the box that says something like Allow executing file as program. The warning will be gone.\n\n*Remember to use absolute paths in the desktop file. Don't use relative paths. An example of an absolute path is /home/username/arduino-1.6.7/. A relative path is something like ~/arduino-1.6.7 (the ~/ points to your user folder) or ./arduino-1.6.7 (./ means whatever folder you're currently in, which would be the Desktop in this case).\nIf you need any help, comment.\n\nA: Did it work? Just as a tip - after you create a desktop entry, while you're still in the desktop folder, execute:\ndesktop-file-validate foo.desktop\n\n\"foo, of course\" is the name of your desktop file. What this will do is check your file against the specifications of freedesktop.org for semantic and stylistic errors. Some of the aforementioned lines aren't actually necessary, just optional - such as comment (aka tooltip), categories (refer to freedesktop site for compliance and usage), and terminal (only useful if the program must be executed in a terminal).

I am compiling in terminal a c code and when I am trying to run it I got this error.\nIs there any specific meaning?\nand how I can fix it?\n\nA: Looks like you need some special (root) permission to compile a code. In Linux most of the time you need to be root when doing some special task, such as changing permission(s) of the system file, changing owner of the file, and to copy, move or remove any file from the Linux system directories located inside root path (/) etc.\nSo you need root permissions to compile your code as,\nsudo gcc -o Output Hello.c \n\nor\n\nsudo g++ -o Output Hello.c\n\n*After executing above command you need to enter your root password.\n\nA: Try to access that file using terminal.\nSee if you are facing any problem by it.\nOnce you are done with it, then proceed with the c program.\nMay be you are trying to access a file for which you need root permission.\nSo, either you can use this commmand on a file\nsudo chown USERNAME FILENAME\n\nIt will change the ownership of the file from root to USERNAME.\nor you can also use sudo to compile and run the program with sudo privilege \nsudo gcc -o Output Hello.c \n\nalso, there is another way around. You can use these commands to get your work done..\nsudo chown root:USERNAME Output  \nsudo chmod 4550 Output        // use SUID to get root privilege\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't look like sending power to an usb port used by a device that uses 2 usb ports to function Update\nsince the latest release of displaylink drivers this issue was solved - it was a driver issue\n\nI'm connecting a Lenovo Thinkvision Displaylink USB external monitor to a Lenovo Thinkpad T450s. \nIt works fine when I connect the screen to an AC powered USB hub connected, but when I connect the screen directly to the laptop it doesn't draw enough energy and the screen won't work well (flickers, doesn't refresh properly, doesn't paint windows etc.). It works perfectly when connected to the hub attached to the laptop.\nThe screen came with a usb \"y\" cable (you know the one that is splitted in two plugs on one end). I think it's precisely meant to draw more power when not used on AC powered hubs. However, I do think that Ubuntu is not sending any power there on the 2nd port and when connected on the laptop it only draws power from a single port, which is insufficient. Tried with two different cables, to no avail. Tried also to make sure that the laptop will charge usb devices (always-on usb 3.0 feature, the screen is usb 2.0 anyway).\nI use Ubuntu 15.10. \nHow would you address this?\nUpdates\nLooks like the monitor can work with just 1 usb from the laptop, but I've found more weirdness going on:\n\n\n*\n\n*if I start ubuntu, then connect the display with either 1 or 2 usb, it will work (i can see the refresh rate is better with 2)\n\n*if I disconnect the display, and reconnect it, it won't work. It may turn on and all, but it will refresh very slowly, to the point of being unusable.\n\n*if anything related to screen displays refreshes/restarts, such as the displaylink service or for example if I update my software for display calibration (DisplayCal), the screen will flash and will enter in this state where it doesn't paint properly\n\n*if I start my laptop with my display connected already (either to 1 or 2 usb) it won't work, it will only function in this bad state - sometimes it will even keep the same appearance as I left it since last reboot (same partially painted areas)\n\n*disconnecting and reconnecting again after the screen has entered in this state, no matter what, it will always bring it back in the same unusable mode. I have to restart ubuntu with the screen disconnected, then connect the screen and hope it won't hang\n\n*very interestingly, whenever the screen is in this failed state, it will show 2 extra displays in my \"Screen\" settings - one correctly labeled Lenovo Thinkvision 14\" and the other labeled as FNM 0\"\n\nall this leads me to believe is something that could be fixed within ubuntu\n\nA: You might try the tlp package for Thinkpad power management, it provides some USB options:\nhttp://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html#usb\nRead the install instructions carefully, it is incompatible with laptop-mode-tools (uninstall first).\n# tlp stat| grep -i USB\n\nshows the info about USB device manamement then.\n\nA: As has been said earlier, software can't control what power is sent out to what USB ports, however depending on the spec, to which the port was build, will depend on what the electroncis will kick out of it.  It sounds like you need to get back to basics to work out what power you have/need.  \nI've had similar problems with USB and Raspberry pi.  The standard USB (2.0) spec says a USB port should kick out 0.6A (600mA), but the max a device can draw is 500mA.  USB 3.0 increased that, so some devices (and hence some power supplies) can kick out 2A (2000mA), but devices should draw no more than 900mA.  \nTo illustrate my problem, my Rpi, requires (according to spec) 700mA.  If I connect it to a nokia phone charger, it works fine.  But when I start using the network, it crashes.  The reason, I have a 600mA supply and without networking, that's fine.  \nI have a 2A supply, and can in theory run both my LCD display and my Rpi from it.  However if I connect the Display to the Rpi, and power the Rpi with the supply, it won't work, because the total power draw, would excede the limit on the Rpi.  I need a usb hub, that can take the 2A supply and split the power to both devices to get it to work. \nSo it could be simply that you can't do it, with your laptop.  I suggest you check the small print.  If the Laptop is USB2, there is a good chance it won't supply more than 1A over 2 devices, that may not be enough for your display.  \n", "Q: BootRepair doesn't start when trying to recover boot I have a Lenovo G40 that came with windows 10. I resized/deleted some partitions and now I have 9 partitions, one of them with Windows 10 and other with Ubuntu.\nProblem is when updating, windows 10 killed the grub and now it starts automatically to windows 10. I made a liveUsb with BoorRepair, but it fails starting. The message is \n\n\nmount: mounting /dev/loop0 on //fylesystem.squashfs failed: No such device\nCan not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/fylesystem.squashfs) on //fylesystem.squashfs\n\n\nI could restore the grub some other way, but unfortunately I don't really understand how grubs work, hence the attempt on BootRepair.\nIdeas? Thanks you\nEDIT\nHere is the output of BootRepair.\n\nA: I ran into this issue with with my new Dell XPS 8700. Fortunately before even first booting the hard drive with windows 10 on it I Clonezilled and dd the entire base build so if I got into trouble I could restore to the original factory burn. Newer computers with Windows 8 and 10 use EFI partitioning instead of the old MBR schema. The information where your computer boot data is normally stored in the partition /dev/sda1. Back up that /dev/sda1 and keep it safe. If that partition becomes corrupted the whole system crashes. For me the Grub2 loader, wasn't the issue it was a corrupted EFI partition. No Boot repair is going to fix this problem. \nLike you I tried to re partition the windows 10 drive to make room for Ubuntu. Bad mistake.  I used the Live CD version of GParted  and wound up with multiple partitions also and then when booting up again Windows 10 distroyed the Grub 2 boot loader on update. After 3 tries of restoring the original factory build and then trying to re-partition I used a utility call gdisk to see what is going on with the EFI partition (/dev/sda1).\nUnless you are experienced with working with this utility I wouldn't attempt to do a repair with it. I tried and made things worst.  Anyway I saw that Windows had rewritten over the /dev/sda1 partition and all data relating to grub2 parameters was lost. \nOk so how did I finally get my partitions resized to what I wanted them to?\nAfter all this installing and uninstalling I ran Dban to clean up the hard drive for there was so much trash on that drive I figured it couldn't hurt. I restored my computer hard drive to factory state inserted the Ubuntu 15.10 disk in and ran through the usual questions for re-installation and used the partitioning tool utility in the install disk to resize my partitions to the size I wanted. (Normally you get to that tool by picking something else on how do you want to install Ubuntu). Then I installed Ubuntu into the new partition manually (refer to the Ubuntu manual if you do not know how to do this). After booting grub came up and I ran windows and ubuntu and all were happy. I tested to see what happened after doing Windows and Ubuntu updates by using gdisk and the efi partition was still in tack in concerns to my /dev/sda1 partition. Never ever touch that partition without backing it up.\nSo my suggestion is to first see if my scenario is applicable to your computer. Your description is so close to the experience I had it could well be. If your using a legacy MBR/BIOS boot then none of this is applicable. Since the default of most Windows 10 installations require EFI I'm assuming that is what your computer is using.\n\n\n*\n\n*If your situation seems similar to mine I would highly suggest backing up any data which may be on your hard drive and restoring to close to factory state as possible. My Dell had a restore disk which did a fairly decent job of putting back all the partitions correctly. I only used the clonezilla backups because I wanted to better understand what is actually going on and starting from scratch was the best way to do it.\n\n*Load the Live Ubuntu CD disk in. I'd highly suggest using 15.10 + because it understands EFI partitioning much better than its predecessors. I had trouble partitioning with 14.04 LTS. Partition the way you would like to and install Ubuntu into the manually created partition. Be aware to give Windows 10 enough room to work. \n\n*Run through the Ubuntu install process and hope for the best.\nSome pointers \n\n\n*\n\n*If you decide to use Clonezilla for a backup, and use images, make sure you save (saveparts) each partition separately. If you make one image of your hard drive Clonezilla screws up the restore because it gets confused between mbr and efi or uefi.\n\n*Make sure before doing a Clonezilla backup that your windows 10 is fully updated. There is a dirty bit flag in Windows that Clonezilla picks up and unless you check in the advanced setting to ignore it the program will not copy your windows partition. Best way to avoid this is to make sure Windows is fully updated.\n\n*I would suggest for the first backup also do a dd. It's a pain but no matter what it will restore your drive to the original state.\n\n*Make sure you use the latest of any software to insure there is a fighting chance the program understands efi. There are plenty of them out there that don't and if that efi partition is not updated trouble will ensue. As mentioned I found the Ubuntu 15.10 Live CD did a pretty decent job on making sure the EFI partition (/dev/sda1) was updated but GParted crashed the hard drive. \n\n*DBan did not run from an EFI partition boot and I had to change the Setup Utility to legacy MBR/Bios boot in order to get that program to work. Use that program with caution because it will completely wipe out your hard drive data! You could skip this step but if your getting to many problems occurring I found this cleared them out for me.\n\n\nAs always proceed with caution and best of luck.\nZV\n", "Q: Error on booting Ubuntu PXE-M0F This is my first time to install Ubuntu, I used PendriveLinux to install Ubuntu 15.10 on a USB Drive, changed the BIOS to boot from the USB drive first and when the computer boots it displays the following error message:\nRealtek PCIe FE Family Controller Series v1.23 (07/28/10)\nPXE-E61: Media test failure, check cable\nPXE-M0F: Exiting PXE ROM.\nOperating System not found\nThis HD has already Windows 7 and I was planning to install a fresh Ubuntu OS removing Windows 7 completely, I searched and found a few threads talking about the same error but it seems all of such errors happen after the OS is installed and then rebooted while in my case I am not even given the option to install the OS\nI even tried it on another computer and it seems it is giving a similar error.\nAppreciate your advice?\nNote: I used the steps in this link to prepare the USB bootable drive (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStickQuick) and under step 1 I choose 'ubuntu'\nThanks\n\nA: After different trials I was able to find out the problem, it seems that the downloaded ISO file was not complete although Chrome Download Manager has mentioned that the download was complete, I downloaded a fresh copy, checked it with the MD5 Checksum and it seems to be working now, at least I can see now the Ubuntu initial installation menu\nI am facing another issue though and I have been searching for a resolution for some time now so probably I will post another question related to this other issue\n", "Q: More Wine Programs crash VNC I have a problem when I run a program with Wine on ubuntu 14.04 more than one time.

You are also correct to create this partition from the Win10 side, and 30GB should give enough space for the install. But you will need to create an additional partition for the swap space that Linux has to have (usually double the RAM - 4GB). You may also have to format these partitions (NTFS,FAT32) to make them visible for the ubuntu install.\nNow, when choosing your / partition, find the 30GB partition, change to a Linux filesystem (ext4), and choose the 4GB partition as a swap drive (filesystem will be swap).\nIf you only had a c: drive and created a 30GB d: partition, this partition should be empty unless you put data in the drive. Make sure that this partition and the swap partition are empty BEFORE starting the ubuntu install.\nfollow these instructions and the install should go as you wish it to including GRUB setting up the dual boot that I believe you are looking for.

If you are having dropped connections, there may be a few things you can try.\nFirst, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland.

Why, and is there some way to debug thunar custom actions?\n\nA: There are two issues here. One is that the && is not recognized and you need a full shell and the other is that in order for it to run, you need a tty which thunar doesn't have when launched from the GUI menu. So, first write a script with these contents:\n#!/bin/bash\ngpg --passphrase-file /home/beos/.gnupg/sympass --symmetric \"$1\"  && rm \"$1\"\n\nMake the script executable (chmod a+x /path/to/script.sh) and then set the action to:\nxfce4-terminal -x /path/to/script.sh %f\n\nThat should cause it to run in a terminal and in a normal bash session so it should work as expected. \n", "Q: Ubuntu does not detect any usb port, wifi, ethernet or webcam I have dual booted ubuntu with windows 10.

Thanks\n\nA: Usually, dither is something you apply purposely on an image to compensate loss of information when you remove colours. This is something gifsicle can do:\n\n--dither\nThis  option  only  matters  if  the  colormap  was  changed. With\n              --dither  on,  Floyd-Steinberg  error   diffusion   is   used   to\n              approximate  any  colors that were removed. This looks better, but\n              makes bigger files and can cause animation artifacts, so it is off\n              by default. \n\nBut if I understand correctly, you are asking for the converse operation, rolling back changes applied by a dithering algorithm. This is not impossible to do, but requires the exact knowledge of the dithering algorithm applied. gifsicle is naturally not able to do it. \n", "Q: Automatically connect an Openconnect VPN connection I installed the network-manager-openconnect package and uses it to login to my Openconnect VPN server.

Issue with windows disk access I am trying to install ubuntu-14.04.3 on my system which already has windows 10 installed (upgraded from Windows 8.1).\nI can boot into ubuntu from a bootable USB drive. However when I try to install it I do not see the option to install ubuntu along with windows. I've found out that this is due to windows partition not being accessible due to windows going into hibernation when shut down.\nAs per the various guides on the internet I have disabled fast start-up from windows and checked that my BIOS is Legacy. The hibernation option is not available in windows. So why would ubuntu complain about mounting windows partition being unsafe? Is this a problem on windows side? I can mount the partition in read only mode but that still doesn't solve the missing dual mode installation option problem.\nIs there anything that I can do here to solve this problem?\n\nA: So if I understand correctly you are trying to install Ubuntu on a hard disk that already has Windows installed on it but the Windows partition isn't showing up when running the Ubuntu installer? \nCheck your hard disk partitions. You can only have 4 primary partitions on a basic HDD. A typical Windows install has 1 partition for its system files, 1 for its c: drive and user directories, and 1 recovery partition. This leaves you one remaining partition on which to install Ubuntu.  Ubuntu typically at minimum format 2 partitions when installing; a / partition for its root dir and a /swap partition. If this is the case and there are not enough unused partitions or enough space remaining on an unused partition to install Ubuntu, this install will be impossible on one basic disk. \nIf this sounds like your problem. Try removing the Windows recovery partition (should probably copy these files to somewhere else first in case you need them later or don't want the dual boot disk anymore) and reformat the free space as one unused partition. then configure Ubuntu installer to manually partition your disk when prompted so as to avoid installing the /swap partition ( note that this should only be done if your system has sufficient RAM >=2GiB). \nTo check your windows partitions use diskpart from the command line and select disk and view partitions or go to your disk manager to visually see the partitions on your drive.\n\nA: I solved the dual boot problem. My exact issue was that after the Windows upgrade (from 8.1 to 10), the system went into UEFI and Legacy mode. Setting the BIOS to UEFI Only resulted in system failing to boot windows (No bootable device is detected.. error).\nSetting the BIOS to Legacy Only solved the problem. This also required re-arrangement of boot device order which was not required with the UEFI and Legacy mode.\nOnce the installation USB booted in BIOS mode, windows 10 was detected by ubuntu installation.\n", "Q: Repairing Network Manager Packages From Live USB?

What's relevant here is that I was trying to locate the drivers I'd need to build for my wireless USB adapter (RTL8811AU if it matters) but after building realized an earilier concern was in the way.\nThat is, initally upon install the network manager service was working fine, telling me I had an ethernet connection where what I wanted was a wireless one; but upon preforming initial updates I no longer saw the network indicator and kept getting a \"Network services are not compatible with this version\" message.

All of them, however, were for 12.x and 14.x Ubuntu versions, I went with the 14.x guides here for best chance at similarity:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/727462/526146\nObviously since I'm here now, this was a bad idea. Ubuntu 15.10 is still running fine, just with zero access to the internet. I have the LiveUSB I used to install it on hand still, same Ubuntu 15.10 minus any post install updates. Any idea how I could repair my network manager packages using it?\n\nA: I don't think you can do from live USB but you can try wired connection to install network drivers.\nIn Linux, most drivers (the ones that are open source) come with the kernel; so the packages that contains the driver are \n\nlinux-image-generic\n\nand (possibly) \n\nlinux-firmware\n\n(1).\nYou can check if it is up-to-date with\n\napt-cache policy linux-image-generic\napt-cache policy linux-firmware\n\nand updates should be automatic --- if not, the classical old sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade should work.\nNotice that sometime there is a problem in upgrades that makes that the old kernel is retained; in that case use\n\napt-get install linux-generic\n\nto update the kernel/firmware to the last available for your distribution.\nIf the device has a not open-source or a driver which is not in the official kernel, things are different, and are very device-dependent.\nFootnotes:\n(1) normal kernels. change \n\n-generic\n\nwith \n\n-rt\n\nor \n\n-lowlatency\n\nif you have some fancy (audio workstation, real time) configuration.\nSource : How to I update Ralink 5390 adapter driver via terminal?\n", "Q: Ubuntu server boots to Console but nothing more My Ubuntu server just boots to the console and then I can't log in or do anything. It just gets stuck in a boot loop, I have Gnome installed as a GUI.\nThis happened after I used the command sudo chmod 766 / to try to unlock all folders. I did NOT use any command involving -R.\nWhat shall I do?\n\nA: -R flag is recursive which means it will affect parent directory and all sub directories and files. You have 3 options here really. \n1.) just reinstall your system which is nice if you dont want to spend all day figuring out this problem and you didn't have anything you really needed on the system. \n2.) extract data then reinstall. if you did have something on there that you needed try booting to a different medium (USB or optical disk) and extracting your file that way then reinstalling. \n3.) spend hours trying to figure this problem out before giving up and drinking a 6 pack and playing some video games. then reinstall your system when you're done rethinking your life. \n4.)

I tried Startup Disk Creator, Unetbootin, and sudo dd after formatting the disk with FAT 32 and NTFS, and also I tried these with three different USB drives in two different USB ports, and two different computers. But every time, Ubuntu 15.10 started. When I press F12 (Dell's boot menu) USB drive doesn't occur as one of the options. I tried these different .iso files from different sources, and even a couple Win 7 .iso files.\nMy laptop is a Dell Inspiron N5110 B45B45 with 500 GB Serial ATA (5400RPM) HDD, Intel Core i5-2450M (2.50GHz, 3M cache), 4096MB RAM(1x4096) 1333MHz DDR3 Dual Channel.\nIs it a problem about BIOS?\nThank you\n\nA: Startup Disk Creator and Unetbootin are known to not configure the  media properly.  \nOpen the Disks tool and click ☰ (on the right top corner) - select Restore Disk Image.  \n\nSelect the Ubuntu installation ISO image and the USB disk - start the restore process.  \n\nReboot the computer and select the USB drive entry from BIOS menu to boot from.  \nThis method is proven to work and to create the Ubuntu installation media properly.  \nUpdate addressing your comments that you cannot boot into a working system: \nCreate the media using the diskpart tool in Windows.  \nOpen command prompt as administrator and execute :  \ndiskpart\nlist disk  \nselect disk *  \nclean  \ncreate partition primary  \nactive  \nformat fs=fat32 quick  \nassign letter=**  \n\nNote: * = number of USB drive | ** = select a free drive letter\nMount the ISO image and copy the content to the USB drive.  \nChange the boot order in BIOS to boot from the USB drive.\n\nA: Check your BIOS boot order.

I want to delete my ubuntu from this computer and i'm having a problem by not knowing what partitions I  need to delete.\nhere is a screenshot :\n\nif you can recognize which number i need to delete i will be thankful.\n\nA: First, don't delete Ubuntu's partition without first adjusting the boot order! Many people make this mistake, and it results in the computer booting to a grub> prompt, which is confusing and unhelpful.\nThe easiest way to adjust the boot order on an EFI-based computer (which yours seems to be) is to use the third-party Windows EasyUEFI program. Click the entry for the Windows boot manager in the list and move it to the top of the list using the up-arrow button. If you don't do this, many computers provide a built-in boot manager you can use, but details vary from one machine to another. Typically, you access the boot manager by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key (usually F8 or above). You'll then see a list of boot entries, one of which should take you to Windows, where you can use EasyUEFI to adjust the boot order.\nWith that done, you can identify and delete your Ubuntu partition. Unfortunately, the Windows partitioning tools don't know a thing about Linux filesystems, so they don't show sufficient detail to be 100% positive. It looks like the partition you've identified as #4 is your Linux swap space and #5 is your root (/) partition, but I can't be certain of that. It's best to boot into Ubuntu and check this detail before you begin. You can use GParted to identify your partitions or examine the /etc/fstab file to see what's mounted where. (Note that /etc/fstab will likely have an entry for your EFI System Partition (ESP), but you must not delete that partition. Likewise, there might be entries for Windows partitions.)\n", "Q: wifi doesn't work after installing ubuntu i have installed linux alongside windows 10 on my laptop.

According to documentation \"Exit status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.\"\nUnfortunately command exited without giving any clue why it failed. I tried using straces but unfortunately I am unable to diagnose anything based on produced log (last 150 lines of 3.5GB strace file are posted to https://gist.github.com/matkoniecz/15ed855bd3f161ad6354c7d637234804 - and also for diff running with sudo that failed after producing 78KB of strace log).\nI considered modifying diff command to output some explanation before dying and returning 2, but given that it is unlikely that my program is unique lack of support for such debugging seems to indicate that there are better solutions (hopefully it is not \"learn how to interpret strace\").\nSo how I am supposed to check why my diff command failed? Is there any better tool than strace or adding printf debugging to diff command?\n\nA: You can read the output. diff doesn't give different exit status codes other than:\n\n*\n\n*0 if inputs are the same,\n\n*1 if different,\n\n*2 if trouble.\n\n(from man diff)\n\"Trouble\" means it couldn't read a file, or pretty much anything else.\nFrom a little testing using diff (GNU diffutils) 3.3 and comparing folders, diff outputs messages to stdout or stderr:\n\n*\n\n*If one file is missing then the exit status is 1, and this appears on stdout:\n  Only in folder1: file-a\n\n\n\n*If one file is unreadable then the exit status is 2, and this appears on stderr:\n  diff: folder1/file-b: Permission denied\n\n(If both errors occur, the exit status is 2.)\nSo, read / parse stdout and stderr to find out what the problems are.\nNote that diff will continue processing further files after encountering \"trouble\", so the line reporting the reason for the exit status 2 may be at any part of the output.\n\nSee this GNU \"diffutils manual\" link for more info on comparing directories (and using diff in general , it's insanely more detailed than just man diff). Info like:\n\n... if you use the --report-identical-files (-s) option, it reports pairs of identical files\nIf only one file exists, diff normally does not show its contents; it merely reports that one file exists but the other does not. You can make diff act as though the missing file is empty, so that it outputs the entire contents of the file that actually exists... use --new-file (-N)... If the older directory contains large files that are not in the newer directory, you can make the patch smaller by using the --unidirectional-new-file option instead of -N.\nTo ignore some files while comparing directories, use the --exclude=pattern (-x pattern) option\nIf you have been comparing two directories and stopped partway through, later you might want to continue where you left off. You can do this by using the --starting-file=file (-S file) option. This compares only the file file and all alphabetically later files in the topmost directory level.\n\nOr these related Q's from other sites:\n\n*\n\n*What are the error exit values for diff?\n\n*Bash: using the result of a diff in a if statement\n", "Q: Are these three dots part of a filesystem path?

We see that there is only the swap partition (/dev/sda9) between the / (/dev/sda8) partition you want to grow and the free space. So we can do this in few simple steps, even from your running system without having to boot from a live disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch gparted.\n\n*Unmount the swap partition (/dev/sda9) by right-clicking on it and selecting Swapoff from the context menu.\n\n*Move the swap partition (/dev/sda9) to the end of the drive.  \nTherefore right-click on it and select Resize/Move.

How can I make my laptop fan speed be full all the time? \nToshiba Satellite \n\nA: Most modern laptops have fancontrol settings in their BIOS. This is the simplest way of controlling your fan speed and there may be an option to have the fan at full speed all the time.\nIf not you could install 'lm-sensors' and 'fancontrol'. There is an excellent set of instructions for doing so here.\nThen configure 'fancontrol' to have the fans running at full speed by setting MAXTEMP to a low temperature like 30.\nA more interesting question is why do you want the fans running at full speed? If your laptop is overheating check that the fan and air-vents are not choked with dust. If you don’t want to open up your laptop it is safe to use the nozzle of an ordinary household vacuum cleaner to clean the vents.  \n\nA: You cannot control the fan settings/speed from the computer, however this might be able to be controlled by the BIOS, but please check.\nIf you are having overheating issues, disassemble the laptop, check for dust on the fans and if necessary, add some thermal paste to the cpu and fans WARNING: THIS MIGHT VOID YOUR WARRANTY.

In the Bios, there's an option to boot from the DVD Drive in EFI mode, but no such option exists for for USB booting. I was able to install Windows 10 in EFI mode through the DVD drive, but I'm unable to do the same with an Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit DVD. Is there a way a FORCE Ubuntu to boot in EFI mode, whether from a USB or DVD?\nMy exact motherboard model is Gigabyte GA-78LMT-USB3 rev 5.0\nI looked on another Ask Ubuntu for making a EFI Ubuntu installer, but was unsuccessful for me.\n\nA: I owned such a computer once. The Gigabyte Hybrid EFI is, hands down, the single worst x86/x86-64 EFI implementation I've ever encountered. (Note that I currently own 12 EFI-based computers, and I've used countless more at work.) See this page of mine for details of my experiences with this system.\nOverall, my recommendation is to abandon your attempt to use EFI mode on that computer. Re-install Windows in BIOS mode and install Ubuntu in a BIOS-mode dual-boot. That will almost certainly go much more smoothly and be much less likely to cause problems in the future.\nIf you must use EFI mode for some reason (like if you've got an over-2TiB hard disk), then you should first be aware that the computer doesn't remember its boot options, so you must use a fallback filename on the EFI System Partition (ESP). You can install in either BIOS mode or EFI mode and then install an EFI-mode boot loader using the fallback filename of EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi -- that is, you must copy EFI/ubuntu/ to EFI/BOOT and rename shimx64.efi or grubx64.efi to bootx64.efi in EFI/BOOT. (Alternatively, you can do something equivalent with another boot loader, like ELILO or rEFInd.) See this section of one of my pages for a little more on this approach. Note that if you install in BIOS mode, you'll need to install the boot loader after doing the main installation, and this can be awkward if you're in BIOS mode.\nOne major caveat is that, if you're dual-booting with Windows, the Gigabyte EFI might favor the Windows boot loader (EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi) over the fallback filename of EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. If so, you'll need to give your boot manager the Windows boot loader name and configure it to boot the Windows boot loader under another name. Boot Repair can do this in a semi-automated way for GRUB by using an option on the Advanced menu; or the mvrefind command can help out if you use my rEFInd.\nThe above hoop-jumping is one of the reasons I recommend you abandon an EFI-mode installation on anything using a Gigabyte Hybrid EFI.\n\nA: You are right - there is no UEFI boot mode for USB on your motherboard.\nBUT\nYou can install Ubuntu in non-EFI mode and that move it to EFI-enabled boot.\nHere are links to show how to do that.\nWhich commands to convert a Ubuntu BIOS install to EFI/UEFI without boot-repair on single boot hardware?\nUEFI\n", "Q: GnuPG still 1.4.16 after 2.1.11 installation I have followed the steps in an tutorial to install GnuPG 2.1.11 (even found an error with libgpg-error version, but corrected it).

The installation ocurred without errors. Why my Ubuntu 14.04 don't recognize 2.1.11 GnuPG installation? Or there's a better way to do the installation?\n\nA: About GnuPG Versions\nThere are multiple branches of GnuPG, all under support and receiving updates. GnuPG 1.4 is the legacy version with a different architecture (monolithic vs. the more modular approach of the other versions), GnuPG 2.0 considered \"stable\" and GnuPG 2.1 \"modern\" with added elliptic-curve cryptography. Soon (which can be easily months from now in the GnuPG release history), GnuPG 2.2 will inherit GnuPG 2.0's \"stable\" tag.\nDon't Build GnuPG on Your Own\nThis seems like an issue with the installation location not being on your $PATH, or being there at the wrong location.\nAnyway: do not build GnuPG on your own, if you're not very sure about what you're doing and especially know how to verify the package's signatures, know how to fix issues with your whole system and watch the project's mailing list for security notifications. GnuPG is deeply integrated with Ubuntu, especially in the package management/software center, and you can easily mess up your whole system!\nInstalling GnuPG 2 from the Ubuntu Repositories\nUbuntu 14.04 does not ship GnuPG 2.1 yet, but does so with GnuPG 2.0 (which should be fine, if you're not after elliptic curve cryptography, which is not yet widely spread in OpenPGP, anyway). You can easily install it through\napt-get install gnupg2\n\nUbuntu 16.04 will already ship GnuPG 2.1 under this package name when released this month.\n", "Q: How to migrate ubuntu 15.10 to an other disk I am using ubuntu 15.10 and run it out of my usb3 stick (which has 2 partitions one / and one swap) I want to migrate my ubuntu installation (not only the programs I installed but all the settings like dual monitor tweaks I have made sound preferences codecs etc) from the usb to a SSD inside my pc (for space purposes)\nSo to cut the long story short Nothing wil change hardware wise, same monitors same hardware just want to clone ubuntu installation from USB (I installed it normally ton a usb as a hard drive its not a \"livecd\" running from usb) to my SSD on the same system without loosing my photos,settings,programs\nIs there an easy way or to I have to do it the hard way fresh installing it to the SSD then copy paste photos etc then manually redo the settings and manually redownload the packages? both filestystems (on source USB and target SSD) are ext 4\n\nA: If there is not already any data on the SSD at all, then it is pretty easy:  boot the existing install in rescue mode ( choose from the grub boot menu ), and then at the rescue menu, choose the root shell option, then run lsblk to see what disks are what.  Identify which one is the existing USB, and which one is your new SSD, and assuming the USB is /dev/sda, and the SSD is /dev/sdb ( adjust the parameters otherwise ), run dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb to copy everything on the USB to the SSD.  You should then be able to shutdown, remove the usb, and boot the SSD and fire up gparted to move/resize your partitions to take advantage of the additional space.  Don't try to boot with both disks connected at the same time, as they will have the same UUIDs and this will confuse the system.\nIf you have data on the SSD already, then it is slightly more complicated.  First, create a partition on the SSD to hold your root fs.  You don't need to format it.  Then boot into rescue mode as above, only instead of copying the entire disk, you need to copy only your root partition.  Assuming /dev/sda1 is the existing root, and /dev/sdb3 is the partition on the SSD you want to copy to, run e2image -arp /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb3 to copy the filesystem ( unlike dd, e2image is smart enough to copy only the used parts of the filesystem, and skip the free space, speeding up the process ).  After that, run resize2fs /dev/sdb3 to expand the filesystem to use the additional space in the new partition.  If /dev/sdb4 is your new swap partition, format it with mkswap -U uuidgoeshere /dev/sdb4.  Use the UUID of the old swap partition.  Finally, install grub on the SSD so it can boot: grub-install /dev/sdb.  After that, shut down, remove the usb stick, and boot from the ssd.\n", "Q: locale-gen doesn't work As I need my locale which is fa_IR.UTF-8 on my Ubuntu Server, I'm trying to install it through (sudo) locale-gen \"fa_IR.UTF-8\" but I don't get any output:\nuser@s1:~# sudo locale-gen \"fa_IR.UTF-8\"\nuser@s1:~#\n\nAND IT DOESN'T ADD ANY LOCALE to my locales!\nWhen I'm trying to install new locales on my Ubuntu Desktop I don't get this error and It works well! as follows:\nuser@s1:~# sudo locale-gen \"fa_IR.UTF-8\"\nGenerating locales...\n  fa_IR.UTF-8... done\nGeneration complete.\nuser@s1:~# \n\nPlease help me what's the problem and what shall I do?\n\nA: This happened because the names of quite a few UTF-8 locales in /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED don't include the codeset part \".UTF-8\", and fa_IR is one of those.\n$ grep -E '[a-z]+_[A-Z]+ UTF-8' /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED | grep fa\nfa_IR UTF-8\n\nIn Ubuntu 16.04 the locale-gen script has been changed, so the user doesn't need to be aware of the exact naming in SUPPORTED. Hence in 16.04 this will work:\nsudo locale-gen fa_IR.UTF-8\n\nFor previous Ubuntu versions, the simplest way to create one of these locales is to use the exact name according to SUPPORTED, for example:\nsudo locale-gen fa_IR\n\nSo, AbdolHosein, your question helped us improve Ubuntu. Thank you for that. :)\n\nA: At last I could find the solution by doing some things manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*check which locales are supported :\nless /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED\n\n\n*Add locale to list of generated\n(sudo) echo fa_IR.UTF-8 UTF-8 >> /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local\n\n\n*Regenerate list (it will invoke locale-gen...)\n (sudo) dpkg-reconfigure locales\n\n\nA: As I understand it according to the man-pages, local-gen does not take any parameter, so e.g. sudo locale-gen \"de_DE.UTF-8\" does not do anything.\nFrom man locale-gen:\n\nlocale-gen  is a program that reads the file /etc/locale.gen and\n  invokes localedef for the chosen localisation profiles.  Run\n  locale-gen after you have modified the /etc/locale.gen file.\n\nThe solution was simply to modify /etc/locale.gen accordingly using:\necho \"de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8\" | sudo tee -a /etc/locale.gen\nsudo locale-gen de_DE.UTF-8\n\nUpdate: According to Gunnar Hjalmarsson´s comment arguments are possible in Ubuntu, but not reflected in the man page. This answer still might be relevant for people who configure other systems from their ubuntu machine and wonder, why they don't behave as expected (as happened to me).\n", "Q: How to find the terminal command executed by any mouse event I mean for example if I am clicking a button in Firefox (or any other event) what is the terminal command that is being executed?\nYes I do know there is apropos but I am asking is there something like if I hover over something it would just tell you what terminal command it would execute if clicked?\n\nA: This is best explained by an example: \n\n\n*\n\n*Take the simplest C program in the world:\n\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    main()\n    {\n      printf(\"Hello World!\");\n    }\n\n2. Take the simplest bash program in the world:\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash          \n    echo \"Hello World!\"\n\nNow place both programs on an icon on the launcher.\nAlthough both programs have the exact same effect on your Ubuntu system, in the second case, we can say that the terminal command being executed is echo \"Hello World!\".\nHowever, in the first case, there just is no terminal command being executed as the terminal isn't involved  at all! Unfortunately for you, most of the stuff inside Ubuntu (drawing menus, drawing icons, displaying a cell in a spreadsheet, right-clicking a word in a document, ...)  doesn't involve the terminal at all.\n", "Q: Setting up Bluetooth is always a pain I have a Jabra Solemate that I had working in the past.  I don't use it often.  I periodically reinstall Ubuntu.\nThe Solemate registers successfully under the Bluetooth manager and I hear the device itself announce \"Solemate is connected.\"  All of this seems simple enough.  However, once I attempt to play any music on Rhythmbox or youtube, the laptop speakers play instead.  All of this despite having an apparently good Bluetooth connection.  This preempts the act of listening to music with an agitation.\nIs there something obvious I need to be doing to get audio to redirect?  \nThe Bluetooth device is set to connect as a headphones device.  When I plug headphones into my computer I never experience an issue.  It always redirects the audio to the headphones.  Bluetooth should be this easy.  That it's not makes me not want to bother using it.  It regularly starts with a bad experience of trying to redirect audio.\n\nA: Have you tried selecting output device after connecting, as you can see in this picture? \n\n", "Q: Different computer with the same hard drive won't boot I installed Ubuntu on a MacBook and everything was working fine.

It may be possible to install xrdp or another Linux RDP package but I have not tried this as I use Ubuntu Server more than desktop and just SSH in anyways.\nLack of audio support in Hyper-V for Linux is one of several trade offs of using Linux guests on Hyper-V hosts.  I have had luck using VirtualBox as the Hypervisor which allows audio, but you must uninstall/deactivate the Hyper-V feature before running/installing VirtualBox as Hyper-V locks the virtualization for Hyper-V's usage.\nWith that said, I have used Linux (Arch, Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, etc.) and *BSDs as guests in Hyper-V for years and am very satisfied with the overall performance and minimal issues.

It will also work on any VM platform, not just Hyper-V.\nAnd the best thing about it is that it doesn't require changing any system setting on either the VM or the host machine.

It will be 4.4.0-xx, that will be based on the latest 4.4.x mainline version.\nYou can install kernel 4.4 to Ubuntu 14.04 without upgrading to 16.04 by running in terminal\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-xenial\n\nRegarding \"how stable is 4.4.6\", it can't be answered as it will be based on opinions.\n\nA: Yes, the distribution upgrade will also update the kernel. However, keep in mind that the upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04, will be offered automatically as soon as 16.04.01 is released and not from the first 16.04 release.\n", "Q: Disable features for a specific user I want to disable all features on a specific user, on my Ubuntu 15.10.

I'll try to address them all:\nWhat can you do with the CLI?\nIn any unix-like system, including Ubuntu and other Linux distributions, the command-line is much more capable than the GUI. The GUI is simply a pretty layer on top. So you can be pretty sure that anything that is possible with the GUI will be possible with a command-line script (though it may be complex to do).\nOpening a browser with a script\nYou can absolutely get a script to open up browser windows (e.g. with xdg-open).\nxdg-open https://google.com\n\nPassword-protected folder\nLocking a folder so it can only be opened with a specific password is trickier.

The command-line and the graphical interface are simply two portals into the same system. In theory you should be able to do pretty much anything through either interface. The only way to make something unachievable through the GUI  is through obfuscation, and that's not ideal.\nAccess permissions\nInstead, you should control access and visibility of files, folders and applications with user accounts and file permissions.

I have been getting the error in ubuntu for insufficient memory space. So I am planning to merge one other partition that I created using windows disk management to ubuntu. The question has been answered in many other tags but I did not find any of them helpful for my case. \nCould you please let me know if I can merge the first parition that is dev/sda1 with the last partition which is unallocated which is of 268GB. \nAttached is the screenshot of the GParted tool.sda3 - windows 10 - C and sda4 windows 10 D folders\n\nA: You can move allocated partitions to the end of the disk right-clicking them one by one and choosing Resize/Move, so you obtain your unallocated space adjacent /dev/sda1. Then you right-click on /dev/sda1 and choose Resize/Move to increase its dimension.\nPay attention: You must boot GParted from Live CD/USB in order to edit your disk.\n\nA: First, there's no such thing as an \"unallocated partition.\" A partition is, by definition, a section of disk that has been allocated in the partition table. What most people mean by \"unallocated partition\" is unallocated disk space -- sectors of the disk that have not been allocated, and that are therefore part of no partition.\nThus, \"merging\" unallocated space with another partition really just means expanding the partition you want to grow. There are several questions and answers on this site relating to this topic, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to resize partitions?\n\n*Why I'm seeing a lock besides the partition I'm trying to modify with gparted?\n\n*How to extend my root (/) partition?\n\n*Gparted - How to move partition to extend the size\nIn your case, your /dev/sda1 is not next to the free space. Thus, expanding /dev/sda1 will require moving every intervening partition. This can be done, but it will take some time (probably between one and several hours), and it poses a risk to every intervening partition's data. There are also Windows boot issues (see below). You should back up your data from every partition you touch before you try to make any changes to it.\nBroadly speaking, there are other options, but they all have serious problems in your case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the partition -- Given the relative sizes, copying /dev/sda1 to the free space might make sense. Unfortunately, you've got an MBR disk, which imposes a 4-primary-partition limit, and you've already used your four primary partitions, so this approach would require some significant gymnastics that are clearly well beyond your comfort zone, given the nature of your question. In practice, this approach would best be taken by backing up /dev/sda1, deleting it, and then restoring the backup to a new partition. However it's done, you'd be left with unallocated space where /dev/sda1 is now.\n\n*Use LVM -- The Logical Volume Manager approach enables combining multiple partitions into one collection of storage space and then carving it up in whatever way is convenient. In principle, you could convert /dev/sda1 to LVM, add the free space as a new partition to the LVM setup, and then carve it up. This would run into the same MBR 4-partition limit just noted, though, and the initial conversion to an LVM setup would be non-trivial.\n\n*Add another partition -- You could, in principle, create a new partition in the unallocated space and transfer data to it. This would be most workable if your personal files (in /home) are growing in size; you could move them and then re-mount the new partition at /home, as described in this question and answer. As with the preceding two points, though, you'd run into the 4-primary-partition limit, which would complicate this process.\n\n\nIt is possible to change partitions from primary to logical or vice-versa (thus overcoming the 4-primary-partition limit) using my FixParts program, which is installed by default in Ubuntu as part of the gdisk package; however, your existing partition layout would make such conversions a bit awkward. The best approach to this is likely to be to convert /dev/sda5 from logical to primary, then shrink /dev/sda3 just enough to open a small gap between it and /dev/sda4, then convert /dev/sda4 from primary to logical. You'll then be able to resize the extended partition that will hold /dev/sda5 (formerly /dev/sda4) and add new logical partition(s) in the extended partition, which will cover your currently-unallocated space.\nOverall, the simplest approach is probably to move the intervening partitions -- but as I say, that's risky, so it's imperative that you back up before you do so. Also, /dev/sda3 looks like a Windows boot partition, and GParted tends to render them unbootable if it moves them. Thus, you should move that partition using Windows tools. OTOH, Microsoft's standard tools tend to flake out badly on disks with extended and logical partitions, which yours has, so you should be extra careful when using them. Perhaps converting /dev/sda5 from logical to primary before mucking with the disk with Windows tools would be beneficial; or maybe a third-party Windows partitioning program would be a better choice for moving /dev/sda3 .\n", "Q: Scheduled backup of home server I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS as a home NAS server. I already made some scheduled rsync script to backup my photos, documents etc to an external drive.\nI want to do the same with the entire system, like cloning the \"/\" partition to that external drive on-the-fly, or after an automated reboot weekly.\nIs there any method for that which can be automated with a cron job?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You can do what you want with one single command, with caveats. \nRead on.\nNOTICE: What follows is almost integrally quoted from this archlinux.org wiki. I introduced just a few changes in wording and format here and there, but nothing substantial. All the merit definitely goes to maintainers of and contributors to the excellent wiki.archlinux.org. \nThis command depends on brace expansion available in both the bash and zsh shells. When using a different shell, --exclude patterns should be repeated manually.\n$ rsync -aAXv --exclude={\"/dev/*\",\"/proc/*\",\"/sys/*\",\"/tmp/*\",\"/run/*\",\"/mnt/*\",\"/media/*\",\"/lost+found\"} / /path/to/backup/folder\n\nUsing the -aAX set of options, the files are transferred in archive mode, ensuring that symbolic links, devices, permissions and ownerships, modification times, ACLs and extended attributes are preserved.\nThe --exclude option will cause files that match the given patterns to be excluded. \nThe contents of /dev, /proc, /sys, /tmp and /run were excluded because they are populated at boot (while the folders themselves are not created), /lost+found is filesystem-specific. \nQuoting the exclude patterns will avoid expansion by shell, which is necessary e.g. when backing up over SSH. \nEnding the excluded paths with * will still ensure that the directories themselves are created if not already existing.\nNote: \n- If you plan on backing up your system somewhere other than /mnt or /media, do not forget to add it to the list of exclude patterns to avoid an infinite loop. \n- If there are any bind mounts in the system, they should be excluded as well, so that the bind mounted contents is copied only once. \n- If you use a swap file, make sure to exclude it as well. \n- Consider also whether you really want to backup the /home/ folder. If it contains user data (e.g. on a desktop OS), it might be considerably larger than the system itself and NOT relevant to the backed up system itself. \n- Otherwise [e.g. on a server machine] consider excluding unimportant subdirectories such as /home/*, /.thumbnails/*, /home/*/.cache/mozilla/*, /home/*/.cache/chromium/*, /home/*/.local/share/Trash/*, depending on software installed on the system. If GVFS is installed, /home/*/.gvfs must be excluded to prevent rsync errors.\nIf you want to do this in a cron job, e.g. at reboot, use the @reboot directive in the cron job instead of a particular day or time. For example, the following cron job runs the script.sh script file one time only after the system restarts:\nIn terminal (CTRL+ALT+T), from a non-root user account:\n$ crontab -e\n@reboot /absolute/path/to/script.sh\n\nTo program the job as a root cron job:\n$ sudo -e crontab -e\n@reboot /absolute/path/to/script.sh\n\nRemember to specify the full path to the file you want to run in the cron job. \nFor more information about the @reboot directive and other directives you can use in cron jobs, type the following command at the command prompt:\n$ man 5 crontab\n\n\nYour script should be made executable.\n$ sudo chmod +x /absolute/path/to/script.sh\n\nIf you plan to trigger it from a udev rule instead of a cron job, you should run the rsync cmd in the background, like so:\n$ cat script.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n{\n/usr/bin/rsync -aAXv --exclude={\"/dev/*\",\"/proc/*\",\"/sys/*\",\"/tmp/*\",\"/run/*\",\"/mnt/*\",\"/media/*\",\"/lost+found\"} / /path/to/backup/folder\n} &\nexit 0\n\n\nRemember Startpage is yr friend !\n", "Q: Ubuntu15.10 make a screenshot with keyboard shortcut no save option display？ I have to take a Screen-shot icon from left favorite bar to open a Copy to clipboard ----------- save window.\n When I was using ctrl + Alt + print shortcut in setting in the All Systems -> Keyboard, the window never show and the Picture directory have nothing.\n\nA: I'm not sure I understand the question, but if you are looking for the screen-shot shortcut its just PrtSc on your keyboard.

It looked OK.  \n\n*I replaced to cardR that now works. I tested the same video.\nBoth my CPU kernels was overloaded (100%) and video out of synch about 5-10s between sound and picture.  \n\n*So I wanted to change back to cardA again as I now know it is better.\nBut when I log in the resolution has changed so I can't do anything in the graphical window as I only can see a small part of it.  \n\n*If changed back to cardR => it works with the right resolution.\nBefore I could only use the cardA, now I can only use the cardR.\nThis is a bit ironical as I wanted to know which of the two cards that was the best and now when I know \n\n\nI am stuck with the bad one.  \nQuestion: How can I get/set the right resolution for cardA?\nIf I log in to an not updated or manipulated Ubuntu 14.04 with  \"X.Org..Xserver..noveau..\"-driver\nboth cards works fine with the right resolution (1920x1080). \n\nHow the problem was solved:  \nThank you for the answers.  \nI hoped for a simple solution.\nI realized the best solution was to install a new OS.\nI bought a new grafic card (Nvidia Geforce GT720) so the CPU is probably the weakest link.  \nMy conclusions are:\n0.  Take backup.\n1.  Install the new card.\n2.  Install a new OS in a free partition.

Do not change the profile name).\n       All addons/Extensions, mail, bookmarks, adresslists and so on will be exactely as before.  \n\nA: Short answer to \"short\" question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the ATI card physically from the computer and reinstall.\n\n\nThere is also a \"Long\" answer that involves:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely removing both drivers from the system\n\n*reboot into nosetmode\n\n*install the nVidia drivers\n\n*reboot into normal mode\n\n", "Q: Can i use DD to burn a windows.iso?

You already were on the documentation page on the HP site, that link would have been useful because you're probably looking at the wrong page or you interpret the data in the wrong way. (Which release and which kernel of \"Redhat Linux\"? HP has staff allocated to work on providing support for major Linux distributions internally to their users – yes I had access to that part of their Intranet – which is more like what you should be looking for than an official product support statement, unless you have a support contract with HP. In that case you should do as they say and file support request with them where you don't agree with the service, not here.)

For a laptop a model that's apparently released in 2016 you shouldn't use a kernel and related software components released in early 2015, though. A good idea is to try the development release on new hardware when it's only a few weeks away from the final release date.\nIf your question was about proprietary drivers than that's a bit different and I'm happy to not have to use these.\n\nI am having problems regarding the booting of Ubuntu and graphics issues.\n\nMore details please. Screenshots, photos, logs and everything that helps to describe the exact behavior you are seeing. Please keep in mind: one problem = one question. Don't put two or more problems in one question, that makes this site less usable for everyone. Also note this site is not a bug tracker, Launchpad is.\n\nA: After spending 2 days of searching a solution, I want to share it:\nThe problem is valid also for later ubuntu versions (and also for centos, I've read), for several kinds of the HP Workstation: Zbook 15/17 G 3/5.\nBehaviour: Ubuntu freezes while booting for installation occassionally, also sometimes while booting into Live-Image. I've managed to install Ubuntu (18.04 LTS). Even then I never reached the OS, since the boot sequence stuck with different errors (e.g. nouveau, and soft lockup - CPU stuck for 23s!).\nReason for that behaviour is the Bios setting, that switches between the graphic cards: Onboard Intel HD and Nvidia Quattro, for power management reasons. Ubuntu (and presumably other Linux distros) can't cope with that.\nSolution: disable in BIOS the Intel HD chip (Bios Setup - Advanced Opts - Graphics --> switch from auto to \"discrete\" or \"disable\" depending on the model) see also https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c04070522\nAnother workaround is the option \"nomodeset\" in the grub boot options. Press \"e\" in the grub-selection menu and add in the line beginning with \"linux\" the option \"nomodeset\" before the option \"ro\" at the end of the line. Note, that this solution will help you installing/booting into your ubuntu, but the graphics driver is not loaded properly then (only 1024x768).\n", "Q: How to install MySQL 5.6.19?

Try fully updating your clean LTS install first, that will get you from 14.04.0 to 14.04.3.\n", "Q: fresh newly rented server, spammed with root login attempts Hello i've just rented a server at hetzner.de, and decided to follow the toturials at linode for securing my server!\ni've just completed setting up OSSEC and then right off the bat i get spammed with mails: \n    OSSEC HIDS Notification.\n2016 Apr 04 17:33:10\n\nReceived From: Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP->/var/log/auth.log\nRule: 5720 fired (level 10) -> \"Multiple SSHD authentication failures.\"\nPortion of the log(s):\n\nApr  4 17:33:08 Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP sshd[16267]: Failed password for root from 81.246.42.242 port 48275 ssh2\nApr  4 17:33:07 Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP sshd[16267]: Failed password for root from 81.246.42.242 port 48275 ssh2\nApr  4 17:32:27 Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP sshd[16261]: Failed password for root from 81.246.42.242 port 50924 ssh2\nApr  4 17:32:25 Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP sshd[16261]: Failed password for root from 81.246.42.242 port 50924 ssh2\nApr  4 17:32:23 Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP sshd[16261]: Failed password for root from 81.246.42.242 port 50924 ssh2\nApr  4 17:31:42 Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP sshd[16226]: Failed password for root from 81.246.42.242 port 43742 ssh2\nApr  4 17:31:40 Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP sshd[16226]: Failed password for root from 81.246.42.242 port 43742 ssh2\nApr  4 17:31:38 Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP sshd[16226]: Failed password for root from 81.246.42.242 port 43742 ssh2\n\n\n\n--END OF NOTIFICATION\n\nOSSEC HIDS Notification.\n2016 Apr 04 17:44:09\n\nReceived From: Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP->/var/log/auth.log\nRule: 2502 fired (level 10) -> \"User missed the password more than one time\"\nPortion of the log(s):\n\nApr  4 17:44:08 Debian-83-jessie-64-LAMP sshd[17133]: PAM 2 more authentication failures; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=242.42-246-81.adsl-static.isp.belgacom.be  user=root\n\n\n\n--END OF NOTIFICATION\n\ni'm new to servers so not sure what to make off this? is it a random bot at belgacom.be that tries to break my password, should i just blacklist the ip?\n\nA: Blacklisting the IP won't resolve your issue, moments later you will be attacked the same way by another IP.\n81.246.42.242 is coming from Belgium (verified with ip2location). A method of resolving this is to block all IPs and only allow access to your IP or subnet. However I instead recommend using SSH-Keys and disable root ssh logins. \nFor more information;\nFirewall setup\nssh key setup\n\nA: Those sorts of events/logs for ssh are ubiquitous. Some people say \"change the port\" but as you can see, they scan all your ports, as you can see from the logs, so, IMHO, security through obscurity (changing port 22 for ssh) adds little to security and may or may not quiet the logs.\nYou need to secure your ssh server. Personally I use keys and disable passwords, root logins without-password, and a few rules in iptables.\nI suggest you look at \nHow to harden an SSH server?\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring\nhttp://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/SSH_security\n\nA: The first rule of IT Security is that you will get people trying to attack anything web facing.\nPort 22 is a common target for port scanners and similar service breaching attacks.  For SSH, running on a different port helps slightly to mitigate this; setting your firewall to filter on your SSH port so that only IPs you trust can reach SSH is a more effective system.\nThis is commonly seen with anything Internet facing.  You are likely just one of many getting many root login attempts.  Time to lock it down by changing ports and then IP restricting the connections you allow to your SSH port in the firewall.\n", "Q: Can't make a shortcut to work (properly) I made a shortcut for PyCharm following this instruction (created a *.desktop file; before that I launched the application via terminal by sudo sh pycharm.sh comand). However, the shortcut I made doesn't work properly - if I launch it from Dash the application will be launched but will not work and freeze. The same will happen if I launch application via terminal by sh pycharm.sh. But, if I launch the application via terminal with sudo sh pycharm.sh comand, close it and then use shortcut, everything will work smoothly.  \nHow can I make the shortcut work properly?\n\nA: Replace sudo in the .desktop file with gksudo.\nThis is because sudo cannot ask you the password outside the terminal, but the command needs sudo access so it freezes on the sudo step (apparently still waiting for the password).\ngksudo will graphically prompt you for the password.\nUpdate: To execute without password:\nWe need to set nopasswd on that script.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/sudoers with the command sudo visudo /etc/sudoers\n\n*Add the line:\n%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /full/path/to/script.sh\n\nReplacing /full/path/to/script.sh with the actual full path.\n\n*Save (Ctrl+O) and quit (Ctrl+X).\n\n\nNow you should be able to run it without password.

Ubuntu VM is connected to internet through a virtual ethernet adapter created by Virtual Box.\nIn default configuration, VirtualBox put your VM in a different network and apply NAT (Network Address Translation) between VM and your host operative system.\nSo, even if your computer is connected via wireless to your router, from the point of view of Ubuntu VM it seems that it is connected to a router (in this case simulated by VirtualBox networking engine) through cable.\nMore information on https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html.\n\nA: You can see the device from menus:\nMachine > Settings > Networks\nThere you will be able to see your wireless interface listed in text field 'Name'.\n", "Q: Can anyone tell me step by step way to install Logkeys Keylogger in Ubuntu 14.04?

I am aware of the answers at GParted shows \"unallocated\" on my sda drive (parallel boot with Win XP) and also read a lot more. I understand that I can only have 4 primary partitions and /dev/sda5 should be within an extended partition - causing the \"overlapping\" warning.\nWhat I do not know: How do I solve the problem? I'd prefer to keep my old linux partition - but even if I did not, I can't just reinstall Ubuntu, because the disk is in an invalid state. And I am lucky that windows works fine on /dev/sda5 and would prefer not to remove this partition.\nWhat I also do not understand: What are the two mini-partitions 3 and 4 good for? I assume that windows had created them as boot partitions or something like that ... so, can I remove one of them? Windows mounts the second one as D: and shows files like Temp\\disklayout.txt including information on the disk like it used to be before the \"repairs\":\n  Partition ###  Typ               Größe    Offset\n  -------------  ----------------  -------  -------\n  Partition 0    Erweitert           63 GB  1023 KB\n  Partition 4    Logisch             63 GB  1024 KB\n  Partition 1    Primär            8096 MB    64 GB\n  Partition 2    Primär             350 MB   113 GB\n  Partition 3    Primär             119 GB   113 GB\n\nThanks a lot for helpful directions!\nUpdate 1\nI tried to get rid of the superfluous partition using sfdisk and writing a modified table to the disk.

I wasn't so lucky with fixparts, but testdisk did the trick. Not alone, but the critical part. Here's what helped for me (I'm writing from the once-lost Ubuntu, jippi) - may be helpful for someone else.\nA warning in advance: I never thought that messing around with parition tables was so much fun! But probably don't do that (without a full disk backup), if have have important data on the disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first part would probably been easier just using fdisk /dev/sda to delete the superfluous partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded the partition table via fsdisk -d /dev/sda > SomeUSBFile\n\n*Manually removed the superfluos partition from this file (and changed the numbers of the remaining partitions accordingly)\n\n*Written the modified partition table via fsdisk /dev/sda < SomeUSBFile\n\n*Deleted the last partition, that now was displayed two times via fdisk\n\n\n*The Linux partition was still missing, so I ran testdisk from the Ubuntu live USB stick. It found that there actually is no extended partition, but a primary linux partition instead. But it did not see the Windows 10 partitition.\n\n\n*\n\n*So I, again, wrote the partition table to a file fsdisk -d /dev/sda > SomeUSBFile\n\n*let testdisk write the new partition table (the one, it found after searching for partitions),\n\n*exported this partition table to another file,\n\n*copied the line of the linux partition, and\n\n*inserted this line into the original partition table's file to\n\n*import this modified version via fsdisk /dev/sda < SomeUSBFile.\n\n\n*Windows still run :)\n\n*The ubuntu live-USB then allowed to mount the linux partition (which is strange, as I had enabled encryption during the linux installation...), and install a new grub MBR to /dev/sda (http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd)\n\n*Finally, the swap partition (the old one was now \"unknown\" in gparted) has to be recreated in gparted.\n\n\nA: My FixParts utility (part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu) might be able to fix the problem; however, I can't promise that -- the fact that your logical partition resides entirely outside the space allocated to the extended partition might throw it for a loop. (That problem is extremely rare, and I don't recall enough details of how FixParts reads MBR partition tables to predict how it will react.) You can try running FixParts on the disk and view the partition table to see if it can detect your partitions without risk -- it won't save the partition table until you tell it to do so (via the w option).\nIf FixParts flakes out on the disk, there are at least three other options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using fdisk or some other tool, delete some or all of your partitions and then re-create them. The output you've already shown provides everything you need -- the start and end points (in sectors) and partition type codes.\n\n*Delete all your partitions and then use TestDisk to recover a valid partition table. This approach is normally one of last resort, and it sometimes fails, but it may be helpful if you have problems with the preceding approach.\n\n*Back up all your partitions' contents, erase the partition table, create new partitions, and restore your partitions' contents. This is a major undertaking and you may encounter problems getting everything to boot again, so I'd do it only as a last resort. Backing up before trying other approaches is advisable, though.\n\n\nAs oldfred says, the Windows partitioning tool is unreliable when working with MBR partition tables that contain extended and logical partitions. I recommend avoiding it if at all possible.\n", "Q: How to triple boot windows and two linux distros I just got a new pc and installed windows 10 and I am a big linux fan so of course I setup dual boot with ubuntu 15.10 but I would also like to setup linux mint. I have checked out other questions like this but they all start without ubuntu installed. Is it still possible for me to add another distro after I have installed ubuntu?\n\nA: \nJust install normally. You can boot from your USB and follow the steps\n  of the installer. You can either create a partition manually before\n  installing or use the tools provided by the Mint installer to\n  partition during the installation process.\nThe only thing you really have to worry about is when the installer\n  asks you whether to install a boot loader (GRUB). Then, you have 2\n  choices. Since you already have a GRUB installed by Ubuntu, you can\n  either choose to not install a new one from mint and use Ubuntu's or\n  you can install Mint's and overwrite Ubuntu's.\nA) Use the existing GRUB.\nWhen the installer asks you whether to install a boot loader, say no.\n  Once the installation has finished, reboot and load Ubuntu (Mint will\n  not appear in the list of available OSs). From Ubuntu, refresh GRUB so\n  it will detect your new Mint installation:\nsudo update-grub\n  B) Use Mint's GRUB.\nWhen the installer asks you whether to install a boot loader, say yes.\n  Make sure you install it in the same location where your Ubuntu's GRUB\n  was installed. This will probably be the master boot record (MBR) of\n  your primary hard drive. Reboot and you should now have Mint's GRUB\n  installed and will be able to choose Mint, Ubuntu or Windows.\n\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/155396/how-to-have-triple-boot-linux-mint-17-cinnamon-ubuntu-14-04-windows-8\n\nA: make partition for new distro and install, should be fine. after install update grub\nyou can update grub without rebooting to ubuntu by using chroot, like here\nlink\nalso you probably could edit /etc/fstab to have same /home mount point in every linux installation, but i wouldn't do that, something could go very wrong :)\n\nA: Install Ubuntu first with a partition (Remember your UEFI permissions) then after that instalation Mint will ask you if you would like to install alongside windows and mint, if not use the \"something else\" partition\n", "Q: I deleted Ubuntu's partition on my hard drive now I get gnu grub version 2.02 on boot I wanted to get rid of Ubuntu, but, like an idiot, I just deleted its volume on my hard drive.

It looks like windows 7 and higher is a bit more involved. Just in case this is the case with your setup, I have found a helpful site for repairing windows 8 boot loader. You will however, need a bootable USB drive. \nhttp://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-fix-windows-8-mbr-master-boot-record/\nIf that does not work for you, you can do a search for restoring Windows 8 EFI bootloader or Windows 8 fix MBR. \nHowever, after going to the command prompt through the windows recovery tool. you will probably just need to run. \nbootrec.exe /fixmbr\n\nA: It is very unclear what you want. If what you want is to remove GRUB, so that when the computer boots, you will no longer see the GRUB screen, do this:\nStart Ubuntu or any other Linux system (that comes with sudo preinstalled) from another media than your harddrive. For instance you could use a plain Ubuntu installation USB. This comes with a live Ubuntu desktop you can try (start it up and press 'Try Ubuntu')\nFrom this system, open up a terminal (if using Ubuntu, press ctrl+alt+t)\nFirst, find the 'id' of your harddrive. If you type in:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou will get a list of harddrives and what partitions they contain. All the harddrives will have names like /dev/sdx or /dev/hdx (where x is a letter)\nIn the terminal, run the following command:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=446 count=1\n\n(where sdx is 'id' of the harddrive (referred to as the name of the harddrive above)\nIf prompted for a password when running the command, type in the sudo password.

UNIX System V allowed them, but only the superuser had permission to make such links.\n\nThe Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7 (excerpt)\n...Linking to a directory is restricted to the superuser in most historical implementations because this capability may produce loops in the file hierarchy or otherwise corrupt the file system. This volume of POSIX.1-2008 continues that philosophy by prohibiting link() and unlink() from doing this. Other functions could do it if the implementor designed such an extension...\n\nBecause there is no longer a system call like link() which don't checks the oldpath being a regular file the only way out may be creating a similar function to linkat() doing it your desired way.\n\nA: You can not create hard links to directories in linux.  I have heard that OSX allows this for time machine to use, but not linux.  The closest you can do is cp -l, which will create a new tree of directories mirroring the original, but hard link all of the regular files.\n", "Q: How to Mount this SD card?

Thanks\n\nA: The latest version of normal Ubuntu can work perfectly on computers from 2002, so your laptop isn't old by comparison.\n15.10 should be fine for you, but no one can predict what your experience is going to be, and that isn't the purpose of this site, anyway (sharing experiences). \nYou said yourself 15.10 worked fine, so I see no reason it shouldn't worm when installed. Of course, if you want the most performance possible, there are a few options. \nLubuntu is a version of Ubuntu known for being very lightweight, working well on very old computers, even 1999 iMac PowerPCs. Xubuntu is another option for a lightweight experience.\nThe best thing to do it just try out the default. If it doesn't work, install  something else. You can go back versions (12.04 and 14.04 are still supported), but your laptop can certainly handle 15.10.

During a session, this does not change normally, unless you force Unity to use a specific launcher by dragging it on to the Unity Launcher.\nThis is usually the fastest and most reliable way to both check the validity of the global .desktop file, and detect the existence of local versions, rather then digging through ~/.local/share/applications.\n", "Q: Byobu tmux pane borders When I am using my normal thing it looks like this:\nhttp://timramich.com/random/ssh-big.png\nIf I log in from another client that uses fewer rows and columns, it looks like this:\nhttp://timramich.com/random/ssh-small.png\nWhy does the large one not have the active border on the right?

I do not have any data I want to save, this computer was a hand me down that's been stashed in the drawer for almost a year. Not planning on anything heavier than internet browsing.\nI have a gaming setup as well so I'm not worried if this fails, it's just a side project to take up spare time.\nAlso, doesn't Ubuntu have an install option which allows you to completely wipe the drive and  install? Because if so that's what I want to do.\n\nA: Lubuntu should work well, it's a low ram version of Ubuntu that works well with older hardware.\nAnd yes the installer will let you do a full disk install, which means it wipes anything that is already on the disk.\n", "Q: another /lib question: domain wide lib folder my intention here is not to create another duplicate thread similar to what is the difference between different 'lib' folder in ubuntu\nI have a cluster of machines, all running either Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04 (we have potentially up to 2 versions during transition periods).\nI need to run the same program on all machines, and this program is dependent on a *.so file that comes with Ubuntu in /usr/lib/ folder. However it turns out that different machines have different versions of this *.so file, which creates issues.\nMy question is the following: Is it possible (and recommended) to create a library folder shared by all machines of the domain, for instance we could mount at startup, that contains one version of this file, and that would have priority over the other local lib folders (to ensure that this shared version is always selected)?\nThank you\n\nA: I would not recommend that. You're much better off looking into config management like Puppet or Chef (or any of the others, whichever suits you best) to manage it best. You can then pin certain packages pretty easily to versions and ensure that all machines are running all the same packages etc.\nYou should be able to get yourself in a position where all the 12.04 servers have the same version and all the 14.04 servers have the same version fairly easily also through regular updates. You may need to (carefully) apt-get dist-upgrade some of the machines to get to the same point release. Some may be 14.04.3 others may be 14.04.4.

Still, none of the suggested methods/procedures has worked for me.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04, kernel 4.4.0-040400-generic on a fanless mini computer, Intel Celeron J1800 dual core cpu 2.41GHz. MB:\n\nlspci\n  00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series SoC Transaction Register (rev 0e)\n  00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Graphics & Display (rev 0e)\n\ncpufreqd governor policy is set to performance in all profiles, and minfreq 1330000 maxfreq 2410000 in all rules. \nThe system may run a few hours without other problems than short peaks of throttling. They may last milliseconds or seconds. Any time I check the cpu temps (sensors), they stay <= 40 degrees. Not even close the threshold, set at 80. As long as the cpu throttling keeps within the limits (2.14GHz - 1.33GHz), things are okay. But eventually the cpu freqs get set below the limit, something like 667MHz. Then the clock gets way too slow, skewing like 30 secs a minute. Ntp or ntpdate are to no avail. Restarting or stopping cpufreqd doesn't help. Same goes for thermald or anything else I have come up with. Removing cpufrequtils or thermald doesn't help, nor does disabling intel_pstate at boot. Same problem occurs with 4.2. kernel. What the heck in kernel is dropping the cpu frequensies?\nWhen the cpu frequensies are dropped below the limits they will never recover to normal, even though according to sensors the temps are at, say 37 or 38 degrees.

Yesterday my computer froze up and I had to hard reboot. Sublime text was running when I had to do the hard boot. Then when computer reloaded, I could not open sublime text, the icon shows in the left sidebar as sublime text is running when I open it, and when I use \"alt + tab\" to rotate through open applications it is there as an icon. However the application is just not actually opening for me to use it, the GUI is just not showing. If I \"alt+tab\" to it, nothing.\nI uninstalled and reinstalled Sublime Text 3 also, but still the same issue.\n\nA: If an application does not work after a crash\nRemove ~/.config/sublime-text-3, immediately log out and back in. I am pretty sure it will work then.\nIn these situations, local files can get corrupted, rather then the global ones. The fact that you reinstalled Sublime Text with no success is another indication the cause is locally.\n\nA: In my opinion, the previous answer is a bit over the top. It's likely enough to delete the .sublime-session files in ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Local. Your configuration will stay intact, as will all installed packages and the license data (if available.)\n", "Q: Help understanding and debugging slow boot with systemd network-online.target I've spent some time on google, but I don't want a quick fix here, I want to understand what is going on.

Many questions here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why would a desktop version of Ubuntu block my boot and log in waiting for a network connection? Can these services not start after I booted? I want to understand why anyone thinks this is reasonable at all. Even for a server, wouldn't it be better to let it boot and then start up services which require network?\n\n*How can I debug which services are blocking on network? I tried $ systemctl show network-online.target and it just shows me that the online target is wanted by kerneloops.service. Why would that service need internet to start? Also, this seems like something that would come standard on install. I imagine I can disable that one, but I don't want to spend the next 3 hours disabling and rebooting one by one. Is there a better way to see all of the services which are blocking on network-online.target? Can I defer these services to start post-login instead of disabling them?\n\n*This is the least important to me, but on a desktop with an ethernet connection to a router, why is it taking nearly 10 seconds to get online?\n\nA: I (partially) solved this, so I wanted to post how in case anyone with similar problems finds this.\nSummary: I commented out the line After=network-online.target in /lib/systemd/system/rc-local.service.d/debian.conf. Note that this may break rc.local scripts which depend on network.\nHere's how I found it. First, I read some resources here.\nFrom my post above, I knew that network-online.target was slow, and from googling I knew that it was the thing that waits to have a network connection. I ran systemctl list-dependencies network-online.target --before to determine which services were waiting until after network started, and saw that rc-local.service was there. Also, the graphical target (which I think is the thing that brings up the log in screen) depended on rc-local.service. I ran systemctl cat rc-local.service and saw that Debian had added the After dependency on online, some more info in this bug.\nI think this is safe, as long as you don't have anything in rc.local that needs network, which should be the case for most normal non-server installs.\nNow my system \"boots\" in about 3 seconds, but takes ages to log in after I type my password, so I may have just kicked the bucket down the road, but at least I made progress.\n", "Q: How to change the order of execution of services at startup? I have some services in my init.d folder for e.g. hdfs, zookeeper, elasticsearch, hbase and so on.\nNow, I have added all those services to startup by doing the update-rc.d 'service' defaults command. As we know, hbase can't run if hdfs and zookeeper are not started. So I want to start hdfs first, then zookeeper and then finally hbase.\nhow do I do this?\n\nA: update-rc.d(8) enables or disables services, while the ordering of services is handled by insserv(8), and can be customized by editing the LSB header of the service and setting/adding:\nRequired-Start: $all\n\nIn oldest versions, i can do something like this to determine the order:\nupdate-rc.d myservice start 95 2 3 4 5 . stop 70 0 1 6 .\n\nBut after Ubuntu 14, i tried this Ubuntu 16.04 (4.4.0-31-generic):\nupdate-rc.d myservice defaults 95 70\n\nAnd doesn't work, always creates the order defined in the header:\n sudo find /etc/ -name ???myservice | sort\n/etc/rc0.d/K01myservice\n/etc/rc1.d/K01myservice\n/etc/rc2.d/S03myservice\n/etc/rc3.d/S03myservice\n/etc/rc4.d/S03myservice\n/etc/rc5.d/S03myservice\n/etc/rc6.d/K01myservice\n\nAlso al try:\nupdate-rc.d myservice defaults any_text_wath_you_want lalala\n\nAnds seems like ignores all the text after \"defaults\". I don´t know wath it do when my installation order, I do not think that orders previously installed services.\n\nA: You can do it by update-rc.d 'service' defaults number where the number is an integer and the lesser the sequence number, the higher the service in the queue i.e it will be executed before other services with a greater sequence number.\nThe above command will give the same priority for starting as well as killing the service. You can fine tune it further.\nSo if you have a service which has a lot of dependencies, you can give it a large sequence number to ensure that all of its dependiencies have booted up before it starts itself.\n", "Q: nvidia-smi hangs. cannot be killed even by SIGKILL I just finished carefully installing the latest nvidia drive to an new amazon g2.2xlarge ec2 instance which I would like to use to do some machine learning.\nBefore install cuda and other packages, I would like to verify that the driver has been installed correctly.  \nMy understanding is that nvidia-smi is the tool for this job.\nThe nvidia-smi command seems to return output when I don't use any options.  \nubuntu@ip-10-220-191-26:~$ nvidia-smi \nTue Apr  5 05:51:06 2016       \n+------------------------------------------------------+                       \n| NVIDIA-SMI 352.39     Driver Version: 352.39         |                       \n|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

Only the most recent kernels, 4.6.3 and above seems to work ok with the keyboard & mousepad, and some distributions are far better at handling UEFI than others.\n", "Q: Mounting disk automatically on terminal and persist across users and restarts On the GUI, we can click on the File > Devices > HDD-Name to automatically mount the disks to /media/. \nI could mount them one by one manually, i.e. https://superuser.com/questions/467170/how-do-i-mount-internal-hdds-in-ubuntu-via-the-command-line\nBut is there a way to do the same automatically on the command line?\nAlso, how can these mounted drive persists after I restart the machine or across users?. E.g. if the way to do it automatically is a single command, I can put it in .bashrc to mount them automatically whenever I log on to the user.\n\nA: To mount a device at boot and have it visible in terminal you need to edit /etc/fstab\nYou can find explanation on how to edit and examples at this link\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab\n", "Q: Cloning an SD card to another in Ubuntu using a single SD card reader I have an SD card which has the image of Raspbian jessy for raspberry pi.\nI currently have only a single SD card reader on my computer, and I would like to clone this SD card to another SD card only by using this reader.\nIs there possibility to achieve this\n\nA: you could use dd and your harddrive. \nI will give an example:\nFor the backup (with your rasbian jessy sd card in the reader, but unmounted):\nsudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/home/bruni/backup.img\n\nFor the restore, after you have unmounted and replaced the sd card with a fresh one:\nsudo dd bs=4M if=/home/bruni/backup.img of=/dev/mmcblk0\n\nOf course you will first have to verify that mmcblk0 is your sd card (to do this compare the output of df -h before and after you insert the sd card) and replace bruni with your username.\nI use the above for backing up my raspberry pi kodi installation.\nPS: Neither copy nor rsync will lead to a bootable sd card, which is what you want.\n\nA: This can be done on the Pi. Using Piclone the Raspberry Pi can back itself up to an SD. \nMenu > Accessories > SD Card Copier\nSelect the SD the OS is running from in the top box and the backup card in the lower.\n\nA: I prefer to use existing tools with GUI.\nSo you can use the Raspberry Pi Imager for formatting and writing SD-Card-Images.\nRegarding the creation of drive images (Laufwerksabbilder) you can simply use \"gnome-disk-utility\". There you can see the mounted drives on the left side, which you can easily select and identify the right drive which you want to image/clone.\nThe rest can be done via the menus (to the right) in the title bar.\nSo you only need a harddisk or SSD with the required space for the drive image.\nEasy. You can use external USB-Drives. So it should be easy.\nAs far as I do remember \"gnome-disk-utility\" is not installed by default. But it is definitely worth to be installed when you have to clone drives.\nHave fun.

System is quite stable but I'm unable to resume after suspend my Dell E6420. When I suspend (manually or by closing lid) laptop turning to full load, fan is 100% and screen getting black. Laptop is working normally, keyboard is highlighted, disk and WiFi working, I can connect via SSH.\nWhat I tried:\n- it doesn't matter if it's clean 16.04 or upgraded from 15.10, same thing happens\n- tried to upgrade kernel - now its running on 4.5RC1 (btw works even better than 4.4 LTS)\n- the thing causing high CPU load is compiz (70% CPU usage) and Xorg (25% CPU usage).

I've checked out the info here -->http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/repairing.html but don't understand it enough to proceed with confidence - HELP! :-)\n\nA: Several points about your post make no sense or is confusing:\n\n\n*\n\n*You claim you've got a 4TB disk, but the parted output you posted shows a 1TB disk. It appears that your 4 TB disk is /dev/sdb, but the parted output is for /dev/sda, with no /dev/sdb output shown for /dev/sda.\n\n*The i command in gdisk shows information about an individual partition, so that output is irrelevant. The v command in gdisk verifies the integrity of the entire disk, and that output indicates numerous problems of the sort that seem to imply that the program is working on \"garbage,\" not real data. Based on the warnings at the start of the gdisk output, I'd say your GPT data is so badly damaged that it's useless. It might not even be a GPT disk.\n\n*What you've presented as fixparts output looks like parted output.\n\n\nBecause the information in your question is so confused and incomplete, I recommend you start a new question that shows the output of the fdisk and parted programs on /dev/sdb (sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb and sudo parted /dev/sdb print), since I suspect you may have an MBR disk with some leftover GPT traces on it. Including the gdisk program's v output might be worth including, but not the i output. If I'm right, fixing the MBR data structures may be in order, but you've presented no data that would be helpful in this task, and this site's format doesn't lend itself to such a major re-write of your initial question.\n", "Q: How to create a alias for running a server and its client simultaneously I'm trying to create an \"alias\" to run a server in a separate terminal, then after a few seconds open its client, this is the command I'm trying:\nalias kingp='xterm -e sudo /opt/king-phisher/KingPhisherServer -L INFO -f /opt/king-$/king-phisher/server_config.yml; /opt/king-phisher/KingPhisher'\n\nThe problem with this is that it does not run the second command until I close the server (CTRL+C), and them it runs the client normally, I've tried with & and && at the end of the server command to no avail, it seems like the server, even being run with -e is still not liberating the terminal for the other command to run, I've been successful with -e before and have no idea why in a alias it does not work, anyone can help me? thank you very much guys.\n\nA: The problem is that the alias is first interpreted by Bash, and then by XTerm.\nBash interprets the whole alias as two separate commands: xterm -e sudo /opt/king-phisher/KingPhisherServer -L INFO -f /opt/king-$/king-phisher/server_config.yml and /opt/king-phisher/KingPhisher, and the commands are executed one after the other in the current shell.\nUsing & instead of ; won't help, because Bash will still interpret &; escaping ; or & won't help either, because XTerm has no notion of Bash syntax, and will pass either ; or & as an argument to /opt/king-phisher/KingPhisherServer (along with the remainder of the command, /opt/king-phisher/KingPhisher).\nThe only solution is to tell XTerm to invoke Bash and let Bash do the parsing:\nalias kingp=\"xterm -e bash -c 'sudo /opt/king-phisher/KingPhisherServer -L INFO -f /opt/king-$/king-phisher/server_config.yml & /opt/king-phisher/KingPhisher'\"\n\nUnless you user doesn't need to provide a sudo password in order to run /opt/king-phisher/KingPhisherServer, this will lead to the server not starting because of the sudo command being backgrounded before being able to read the password; see here for possible solutions: How do I run a sudo command needing password input in the background?.\n", "Q: Create Ogre3D 2.1 project I have downloaded the Ogre3D 2.1 source, compiled and installed it without any issues.

However, it does not always appear at the bottom, but at a seemingly random location between the permanent icons. This changes the behavior of Super+Digit keyboard shortcuts, because some icons are now referenced by another digit - which is very annoying. How can I make new icons always appear at the bottom of the launcher?\nEDIT: currently Ubuntu v. 15.10, although the issue happened also with 14.4.\n\nA: Well, my launcher does not place newly launched icons in random order, rather more precisely, it does not interfere with the top 10 (which are labeled 1-0) 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0.  So, I must ask which version of Ubuntu, etc, etc, with more information on your part! Of course, if you by chance lock the new ones to the launcher and then move(click and drag) them around, you can upset the order easily.  Try dragging all locked icons to where you want them, with particular attention to items 1 thru 0.  Below those most cherished, place other important icons closer to the top ten, for convenience. Move them wherever best suits heck, even add em to the top ten if they grow in importance to your way of doing things.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and the solution was to just remove all locked icons (unlock from launcher) and then put them back and lock them.

If you want your Windows or file-storage partitions mounted once your computer boots, you'll need to put appropriate entries into /etc/fstab.\n/etc/mtab is a list of currently mounted filesystems.  If you have a disk connected but not mounted, it won't show up in the /etc/mtab file. Once you mount it, it will show up there.\nNote also, that with systemd (to which Ubuntu switched beginning from 15.04 release) it is possible to declare filesystems that need to be mounted at boot via *.mount files. See James Oguya's tutorial on the topic.\nFor more info, read mount manual.\n\nA: TL;DR\n\n*\n\n*/etc/fstab is a created by the user. It contains list of volumes to be mounted by mount.\n\n*/etc/mtab is a created by the system. It contains a list of currently mounted devices.\n\n*The format of the files is similar. After mounting a new device, copy the relevant line from /etc/mtab to /etc/fstab so that it will be auto-mounted after boot or when calling mount -a.\n\nQuotes from the mount manual\nThe /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts files\n\nThe file /etc/fstab, may contain lines describing what devices are usually mounted where, using which options.\nThe  programs  mount and umount maintain a list of currently mounted filesystems in the file /etc/mtab.\nWhen the proc filesystem is mounted (say at /proc), the files /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts have very similar contents. The former has somewhat more information, such as the mount options used, but is not necessarily up-to-date.\n\nmount -a\n\nmount -a [-t type] [-O optlist]\n(usually  given  in  a  bootscript)  causes  all  filesystems  mentioned in fstab (of the proper type and/or having or not having the proper options) to be mounted as indicated, except for those whose line contains the noauto keyword. Adding the -F option will make mount fork, so that the filesystems are mounted simultaneously.\n\n", "Q: i need to write a bash script to check a service status and restart i need to write a bash script to check a service status.\nI need to look in the command output; /etc/init.d/ipsec status\nThe line \"1 tunnels up\" indicates the service is up.\nIf the line is not part of the command output i need to restart the service.\nSearching in the net there are some examples but searching for service pid, so i can't find an example for this particular case\nAny help to do this script?\n\nA: you could use grep not tested but it would look like this\nservice ipsec status | grep \"1 tunnels up\" \nRET=$?\nif [ ! $RET -eq 0 ];then\n    echo \"[!] No tunnels up, better restart\"\n    service ipsec restart\nfi\n\n", "Q: how to calculate script run time Consider this shell redirect:\ntelnet towel.blinkenlights.nl >> starWarz\nwhen it ends, the session will break, detach from host or something like that. I want to know how long the connection lasts. How might I determine this? \n\nA: Sounds like you're looking for the time builtin:\n$ help time\ntime: time [-p] pipeline\n    Report time consumed by pipeline's execution.\n\n    Execute PIPELINE and print a summary of the real time, user CPU time,\n    and system CPU time spent executing PIPELINE when it terminates.\n\n    Options:\n      -p    print the timing summary in the portable Posix format\n\n    The value of the TIMEFORMAT variable is used as the output format.\n\n    Exit Status:\n    The return status is the return status of PIPELINE.\n\nIt will print a report of the time taken by a command. For example:\n$ time sleep 3\n\nreal    0m3.027s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m0.000s\n\nThe \"real\" field is the actual time that passes, the same value you would have measured with a watch. So, you can simply do:\ntime telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl >> starWarz\n\n\nA: Most of the shells has a builtin named time, bash has it too. It will show you the actual human time (real) a process takes with the CPU time the process spends on user space (user) and kernel space (sys).\nSo run the command perpending time:\ntime telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl >> starWar\n\nAt the end bash will show the time on STDERR like:\nreal    XmX.XXXs\nuser    YmY.YYYs\nsys     ZmZ.ZZZs\n\nEven if you are on a shell that does not have the time builtin you have the external time command /usr/bin/time from the time package. The usage is same.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 Maximizing to wrong screen This is my first post here. I just upgraded (well, reinstalled) to Ubuntu 15.10.

Nope. I could not even drag windows to my left monitor. It would split-screen maximize the window on the right monitor instead.\nNot feeling like fiddling with an unfamiliar desktop environment for too long, I purged it. After which, back in my unity desktop, things magically worked! I can maximize windows on both monitors.

Should I update only 3.19 and uncheck 3.16? Or does it matter? Should I remove 3.16 with sudo apt-get remove?\n\nA: This means that you install kernel meta-package manually by\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\nBut you still have meta packages for kernel 3.16, that are lts-utopic.\nYou can remove all 3.16 kernels using Synaptic and meta packages will removed as well.\nAlternatively you can remove only meta packages and leave the kernels installed.\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-generic-lts-utopic linux-headers-generic-lts-utopic\n\n", "Q: Black screen after boot (with backlight) I use an Asus S500CA, previously installed Windows 8.1 and just installed a dual-boot Ubuntu 14.04\nAt the first time it was fine, everything was normal.

Whenever I try to install ubuntu-restricted-extras I always get errors similar to these, however the answer to that question only resolved the errors I had that time, though I get very similar errors every time I try to install it on a fresh install of Ubuntu, the same solution never works for all and I don't think I should ask here every time... I feel that that would get a bit much...\nBut why is it so? Why do I get these errors (because I didn't used to on previous version of Ubuntu and I'm not sure that other people do)? Is this a bug which I should report or...? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\nInformation Update:\nIt has been suggested that this could be due to an outdated package list, but this is not the case as I always run sudo apt-get update before attempting and upgrade or new installation, so I do not believe that this can be the problem unless somehow that command is not solving it.\n\nA: I believe this could be the reason for this issue:\nOn a fresh installation of Ubuntu, the list of available packets would likely date from the time the Ubuntu release was prepared.\nIf a package dependencies have changed since the last time the packet list was updated, your system may try to install packages that doesn't exist anymore, or eventually report dependency issues.\nFor this reason, it is always recommended to update the package list prior to installing new packets on a fresh installation of Ubuntu or whenever the packages list may be outdated.\nYou can try to update the package list:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nBefore installing ubuntu-restricted-extras:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n", "Q: Why do I get bad sectors? \nWhy do I get bad sectors and how to fix it?\n\nA: Your hard drive is failing.\nMake a backup ASAP and buy a new hard drive.\n\nA: First things first:\nBack up what you can right now and get a new disk!\nWhy? Because your disk has got irreversibly damaged regions that are no longer writeable or even readable.\nThe OS usually marks such bad sectors and stops using them. However, once a disk starts to get them, it's likely that there will appear more damaged regions in the near future,\nTo get more information about your disk, you can check its SMART status and run some self-tests. You get there by selecting \"SMART data & self tests\" in the hamburger menu in the top right corner, or by pressing Ctrl+S.\n\nA: Try to change the SATA cable at first, it cause more bad sectors when it damage, there are also many reasons to find bad sectors, if Sata cable stopped the error the bad sectors will stop to back again , you maybe also need to change the power supply if it died not only the cable if it's a PC ,\nafter you change the Sata cable you can remove bad sectors forever using Disk genius program , making the hard disk as a slave on a running device, or you can use Hiren's BootCD after you burn it on a CD or make boot able USB on a flash memory.\nNote:\n1-The bad sectors often will cause not responding and system failure, remove it will cause damage for the nearest files for it so some files will not work again.\n2- before you remove the sectors backup your important files to another disk.\n3- After remove it by Disk Genius you will need to repair Ubuntu using fsck /dev/sda2 command by a live CD or in the black screen if it appear command port option , while sda2 is the system partition at you maybe will other number, any way only system can be fix by this command, for Microsoft operation system you maybe need to install a new one but try system repair option first.\nNote: If the hard has physical damage new bad sectors will appear again on the running area, so you will need to get another healthy hard disk.\n", "Q: How to install \"qemu-img\" and use it to convert a \"qcow2\" image to a Virtual Box one? I have been asked to do some debugging work with gnome-continuous, but as this only comes in qcow2 format for qemu and I do not want to install qemu at this time so this may be slightly problematic, though I have read here that one may be able to use qemu-img to convert a qcow2 image to a Virtual Box compatible one. I have tried install qemu-img with:\nsudo apt-get install qemu-img\n\nBut it appears as though there isn't a package under that name currently in the repositories, so how do I install it and use it to convert the image? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: The package you want is qemu-utils:\n% apt-file search qemu-img\nqemu-utils: /usr/bin/qemu-img\nqemu-utils: /usr/share/man/man1/qemu-img.1.gz\n\nSo install qemu-utils:\nsudo apt-get install qemu-utils\n\nTo convert a QCOW2 image to a VirtualBox VDI image:\nqemu-img convert -O vdi test.qcow2 test.vdi\n\nOr to convert to a VMDK image:\nqemu-img convert -O vmdk test.qcow2 test.vmdk\n\nOr to convert to a VHD image:\nqemu-img convert -O vpc test.qcow2 test.vhd\n\n", "Q: In landscape, why do package downgrades sometimes not work? I just installed the latest package for firefox across all my computers, and I want to go back to the previous one, why can't I do that?  I tried clicking on the 'undo' operation on the activity and it didn't work.\nWhen I try to downdate to a specific version in the 'packages' UI in landscape, I can do it, but not to the previous version, why?\n\nA: The ubuntu repositories do not keep package versions for very long.  let's look at an example:\nrsync:\n  Installed: 3.1.1-3ubuntu0.15.10.1\n  Candidate: 3.1.1-3ubuntu0.15.10.1\n  Version table:\n *** 3.1.1-3ubuntu0.15.10.1 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ wily-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ wily-security/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     3.1.1-3 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ wily/main amd64 Packages\n\nThis shows there are two packages available.  One in the 'wily-updates',\nand the main one in the 'main' wily archive.  Any intermediate update is\nnow missing.  Landscape would not be able to roll back to it.\nEach archive just stores the latest package.  Since you targeted that\nintermediate package for a downdate by clicking 'undo', the package is no longer there to\ninstall, so Landscape correctly fails.  You should be able to downdate\nto '3.1.1-3' just fine if you want (looking at my example).\nIf you were using a custom repository that kept all old packages\naround, they could downdate to intermediate versions, for instance.\n", "Q: Making a bootable 12.04 Ubuntu Image on a flash drive \n*\n\n*Downloaded ubuntu-12.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads.\n\n*Downloaded Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.6.3.exe from http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\n3 How do you convert the ubuntu-12.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent to the ubuntu-12.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso for the flash drive? Just rename the file? Or is there an extraction process through a bit torrent utility -- and if so ---can you point me in the direction on how to do it?\n\nA: You only have a torrent \"seed\". You haven't actually downloaded Ubuntu at this point. The official documentation states:\n\nBitTorrent is a peer-to-peer download network that sometimes enables\n  higher download speeds and more reliable downloads of large files. You\n  will need to install a BitTorrent client on your computer in order to\n  enable this download method.\n\nSource: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads\n\nA: Thanks for your responses. \nFound out from my IT guy that you need to download and install Bit Torrent (http://www.bittorrent.com/) to download and convert the ubuntu-12.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent on the Ubuntu web site to extract the ubuntu-12.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso image you need to use in order to install it on a PC. Sadly you can't just rename the file, not is any of this documentation referenced on the page:http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads\n", "Q: If command to look at specific lines and value in files I imagine this is a very simple one but I'm really new to Ubuntu.

I'm about to get my hands on a Pioneer Raspberry Pi drive running Owncloud 9 on Ubuntu Snappy 16.04. I want to move my old owncloud instance to this new device, I just don't know how. \nCurrently I'm running Ubuntu Server 15.04 on an old PC. Having a few hundred GB of files in there. Now I want to move all of it to the new Raspberry Pi based Ubuntu Snappy system. All files and configuration. \nI have no experience with Ubuntu Snappy - yet - but from what I've understood about the new packaging paradigm I might come into trouble about an otherwise trivial migration of data. \nDo I still access to mysql so that I can import the old db, as well some kind of access to be able to migrate the old files? Snappy seem to have SSH, so rsync is there, but is there something that I need to think about otherwise about the file migration? \nCheers, \nDaniel \n\nA: I'm afraid this won't be terribly easy, not really because of Snappy but because ownCloud doesn't help you at all (I think it should have a method of doing this), so you need to do it yourself. There are three things you'll have to deal with: the config, the data, and the database.\nThe config\nWhile you can do this via occ, I actually suggest you do it by hand so you don't overwrite some values upon which the snap is relying (e.g. the out-of-application apps folder, etc.). The config.php is located in /var/lib/snaps/owncloud.canonical/current/owncloud/config/. If you want to use occ anyway, note that the command on Snappy is sudo owncloud.occ.\nThe data\nYou were spot-on with this one-- rsync from original to new. The data directory is /var/lib/snaps/owncloud.canonical/current/owncloud/data/.\nThe database\nUnfortunately, you're going to run into trouble here-- the snap itself doesn't expose a mysql client, though maybe it should, knowing this use-case. Feel free to log a bug on that.\nOh, the apps\nIf you have apps you want to transfer, put then in /var/lib/snaps/owncloud.canonical/current/owncloud/apps/\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 development cycle What does the following terms means and being a web developer which one is preferred before the stable release.\n\n\n*\n\n*alpha 1\n\n*alpha 2\n\n*Feature freeze\n\n*UI freeze\n\n*kernel freeze\n\n\nPlease explain a bit.\n\nA: The feature freeze is when feature stop being added/changed.  The UI freeze is when the User Interface stops getting changed.  The kernel freeze is a deadline for kernel updates.  Exceptional circumstances may justify exemptions to any freeze, at the discretion of the release managers.  For more details: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseSchedule\n\n\n*\n\n*If you like seeing new features added in over time and the user interface improved with updates, then you can upgrade before the feature freeze.\n\n*If you like having features not changed after the upgrade, but seeing the user interface improved with updates, then you can upgrade after the feature freeze and before the UI freeze.\n\n*If you like having features and the UI not changed after the upgrade, then you should upgrade after the feature freeze and the UI freeze.\n\n\nBTW, the feature and UI freezes have already happened for 16.04.\n", "Q: Lubuntu - pcmanfm does not fully update on first boot An old 32 bit AMD Sempron 3400+ is running Lubuntu 14.04 LTS.

My BIOS version is 1.12 (I don't know how to update it and would rather not do it)\nIm not an advanced Ubuntu user yet, so I haven't tried much myself yet.\nThe solutions I found so far were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling USB 3.0 in BIOS -> My BIOS doesn't offer this option\n\n*Updating the BIOS -> I don't know how to do this correctly\n\n\nAs this is a rather nasty bug, I hope you can help me solve it.\nEDIT\nI found out the bug with suspending the notebook only exists when NOT connected to power. But then it's quite reliable that the Notebook will freeze. I also tried installing proprietary graphics drivers, which didn't help\nGreetings.\n\nA: I had the same problem running Ubuntu 16.04 on the same laptop (both with and without the power connected).  In desperation I updated the kernel from 4.4 to 4.5.3 (see here and here for instructions) and the problem seems to have gone - both for closing the laptop lid and selecting 'suspend' from the menu.\n", "Q: Improving bash script I need to improve this script:\nnmap -PN -p 9292 -sN 192.68.12.14 | grep \"open\" \n\nI need to check connectivity to ip 192.168.15.24 on port 9292.\nIf the port is open, then print \"port 9292 is open\"\nIf the port is closed, then print \"port 9292 is closed\" \nThe result will be taken from icinga to do a check. \nAny idea?\n\nA: This requires the netcat package:\nif nc -z 192.68.12.14 9292; then\n    echo \"Port is open\"\nelse\n    echo \"Port is closed\"\nfi\n\nnc -z will attempt to make a connection to the specified host and port; it returns a 0 exit code upon success, and a nonzero code otherwise.  It does not actually output anything to the terminal.  To get your desired output, I use an if statement to test the results of the connection test, and echo the appropriate result to the terminal.\n\nA: Apart from @DopeGhoti's correct answer using netcat, your script could be improved by changing some of your Nmap options and adding a few.\n\n\n*\n\n*-sN means \"TCP NULL scan,\" which is a very unusual raw-socket scan mode requiring root privileges. It also has the odd property of only labeling ports as \"closed\" or \"unfiltered\" but never \"open.\" You probably want a normal TCP Connect scan instead, using the -sT option.\n\n*Nmap will attempt to do a reverse name lookup (PTR) by default. Avoid this unnecessary delay with the -n option.\n\n*Using Nmap's normal screen output in a script is not recommended, even for something as simple as this, because it is subject to change between versions. For a stable, machine-parsable output format, use grepable (-oG) or XML (-oX).\n\n*-PN is an old (deprecated in 2010) spelling of -Pn. It skips the host discovery phase, so probably a good idea for your script.\n\n\nExample with all of these changes:\nnmap -n -Pn -sT -p 9292 -oG - | grep '/open/'\n\n", "Q: GUI doesn't have escalated permissions, Ubuntu 14.04 lightdm Relatively new user here.\nSo I am having some permission issues with the desktop. The sysadmin before me set up Ubuntu 12.04 on the other machines, and it seems to work OK. I set a new machine up with 12.04 attempting to use the same configuration but I decided to try 14.04 because 12.04 was acting kind of strange (freezing, crashing problems with graphics).\nSo far so good, but the UI does not give the user ability to mount USB, unlock User Account settings etc. He is part of sudoers, and from terminal can mount USB, and do everything else fine, but the graphic desktop does not allow this. He authenticates through an LDAP, but I'm not sure if this  is this issue, because I authenticate on the same LDAP with my machine and my GUI has the ability to unlock user accounts and mount USB.\n\nA: In sudo pam-auth-update I made sure the GNOME Keyring Daemon was also selected.

Try a command like:\napt-get remove cups\n\nUnless cups is trying to print something it shouldn't require much in the way of resources.  If you are running short on memory try adding some swap space.  You can add use a file for additional swap space if you don't have anywhere to create a swap partition.\nYou can disable and stop the service with the commands:\nsystemctl disable cups.service\nsystemctl stop cups.service\n\nThe default configuration is quite restrictive and should not allow remote access.  Patching is relatively frequent as printer support is fixed, translations updated, and interaction with systemd is adjusted.  There have been a few security issues resolved in recent patches.  \n", "Q: How do I hold a package in landscape? I have a held package in Ubuntu, and Landscape recognizes it -- this is great.  But how do I hold a new package from the Landscape UI?\n\nA: This is a very common question, and the UI is a bit tricky.  I took some screenshots.\nFirst:\n\n\n*\n\n*Computers -> Select Computers -> Packages -> Find Package to Hold\n\n\nYou should end up on a screen like this:\n\nExpand the row of the package you want to hold:\n\nClick the little package icon:\n\nThen apply changes to generate the activity that will be sent to the selected computer.\n\nA: You need to click the package icon in a search results page to set/unset a hold on that package. There are also some interesting details about holding kernel updates, with the kernel metapackage playing a key role.\nSee Mastering Package Holds for coverage of this functionality from both Landscape and the shell.\n", "Q: Logging Bad Sectors Is there a program that will maintain a log of growing bad sectors?\nI want to measure the regression of my hard drive automatically as opposed to manually taking screenshots.\nUPDATE:\nAfter running sudo badblocks /dev/sda | wc -l >> num_bad_blocks.log and allowing it to run over night, the file reported I have zero bad blocks. How could there be such a vast difference?\n\nA: I think you might want to replace your hard drive if you have 300,000+ bad sectors.\nHowever, you should be able to accomplish this by periodically running\nsudo badblocks /dev/sda | wc -l >> num_bad_blocks.log\n\nwhich should total up the number of bad blocks and append that number to a file. You could run this regularly with a cron job.\n", "Q: What is difference between localhost address 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.1.1 I am just learning using Ubuntu and when I tried to configure the DNS, I need to deal with something call localhost, loopback interface. Can anyone explain me the differences between them and the meaning of the addresses 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.1.1, when should I use 127.0.0.1 and when should I use 127.0.1.1\n\nA: As your machine gets started, it will need to know the mapping of some hostnames to IP addresses before DNS can be referenced. This mapping is kept in the /etc/hosts file. In the absence of a name server, any network program on your system consults this file to determine the IP address that corresponds to a host name.\nThe loopback device is a special, virtual network interface that your computer uses to communicate with itself. It is used mainly for diagnostics and troubleshooting, and to connect to servers running on the local machine.\nThe loopback is interface lo and the IP address is 127.0.0.1 by default.\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n\nDebian, then Ubuntu, choose to define 127.0.1.1 for mapping the IP address of your host_name in case that you have no network.\nThe host_name matches the hostname defined in /etc/hostname.\nFor a system with a permanent IP address, that permanent IP address should be used here instead of 127.0.1.1.\n127.0.1.1 host_name\n\n\nA: The following screen capture tells an interesting story.\n\nEffectively, it shows that 127.0.0.1 is the true loopback address. Thus, 127.0.1.1 is there for reasons other than that of basic IP networking.\nAs mentioned by @Videonauth, the 127.0.1.1 line is there as a crutch, a fix, to make finicky software be happy.\nIn my view, the loopback entry should almost always be in /etc/hosts. If you change your hostname from the default of localhost, then change the host name on the 127.0.1.1 line, not the 127.0.0.1 line.\nIf you change your hostname and give your machine a static IP, change both the hostname and IP fields in the 127.0.1.1 line.\nIn short, leave the 127.0.0.1 record alone.\n\nA: It doesn't really mean anything in particular (it's just another IP in the 127.0.0.0/8 block).\nThe reason it's used as the IP for your hostname is explained in Section 10.4 of the Debian Reference Manual.\nQuote:\n\nSome software (e.g., GNOME) expects the system hostname to be\n  resolvable to an IP address with a canonical fully qualified domain\n  name. This is really improper because system hostnames and domain\n  names are two very different things; but there you have it. In order\n  to support that software, it is necessary to ensure that the system\n  hostname can be resolved. Most often this is done by putting a line in\n  /etc/hosts containing some IP address and the system hostname. If your\n  system has a permanent IP address then use that; otherwise use the\n  address 127.0.1.1.\n\n\nA: 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address, commonly known as localhost, which is the name that resolves to it by the local hosts file. This file is in different locations depending on the OS, but in most Linux distros it is in /etc/hosts. This address always refers to the computer which made the request, so 127.0.0.1 is not a \"real\" address so to speak. Each device has it's own localhost. 127.0.1.1 on the other hand is used by certain software to mean the same thing, an alias in a way, but not really. The loopback address used by your machine internally should be 127.0.0.1, so don't mess around with that address in your hosts file!\n", "Q: Can't connect to internet during Ubuntu installation I am fairly useless when it comes to hardware issues, so I appologize if this is a very simple question.

I found somewhere in a forum the solution to a problem where the only resolutions available were 800x600 and 1024x768. I managed to get 1440x900, which works very well. Every time I reboot, this mode disappears. I am forced to retype the commands, so how can I save this? I'm assuming it is a simple command, but I am the largest of noobs when it comes to Ubuntu. The commands are:\n\n*\n\n*xrandr --newmode \"1440x900_60.00\"  106.50  1440 1528 1672 1904  900 903 909 934 -hsync +vsync\n\n*xrandr --addmode VGA1 1440x900_60.00\n\n*xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1440x900_60.00\n\nA: The following simple configuration works for me, and when connected, my monitor automatically uses the correct resolution without any manual intervention.\nsudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nNote that this file may or may not already exist.  Add the following:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier \"VGA1\"\n    Modeline   \"1440x900_60.00\"  106.50  1440 1528 1672 1904  900 903 909 934 -hsync +vsync\nEndSection    \n\nThen reboot.  If all goes well, then things should just work.\nBackground\nI have a UX32VD laptop, and I wanted to have 4K over HDMI, even though there is no 3840x2160 option in the display settings.\nMy first task was to compute the modeline.  Skip this step if you already know the modeline.  (The modeline below may work for you.)  I downloaded umc-0.2.tar.gz, extracted, and ran ./configure and make.  To get the 25Hz Reverse Blanking Timing mode, I ran\numc-0.2/src/umc 3840 2160 25 --rbt\n\nwhich outputs\n    # 3840x2160x24.99 @ 54.625kHz\n    Modeline \"3840x2160x24.99\"  218.500000  3840 3888 3920 4000  2160 2163 2167 2186  +HSync -VSync\n\nNext I wanted to test this modeline.  Running xrandr with no arguments, I saw that my HDMI device is named HDMI-1. I tested this mode by running commands analogous to Jacob's:\nxrandr --newmode \"3840x2160x24.99\"  218.500000  3840 3888 3920 4000  2160 2163 2167 2186  +HSync -VSync\nxrandr --addmode HDMI-1 \"3840x2160x24.99\"\nxrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode \"3840x2160x24.99\" --preferred\n\nFinally, to make the resolution permanent, I created /etc/X11/xorg.conf with the following contents:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier \"HDMI-1\"\n    Modeline   \"3840x2160x24.99\"  218.500000  3840 3888 3920 4000  2160 2163 2167 2186  +HSync -VSync\nEndSection  \n\nTo test, restart the computer.\nI should note that I am running nvidia-driver-390 on Ubuntu 18.04.  Hopefully my technique generalizes well to other configurations.  (Please let me know in the comments.)\n\nA: The accepted answer applies the same configuration regardless of the status of connected displays. This didn't work for me, as I'm connected to different displays at work and at home. autorandr allows automatic xrandr configurations for different display setups. To use autorandr,\n\n*\n\n*Install with sudo apt install autorandr (tested on Ubuntu 18.04, Lubuntu 20.04)\n\n*Configure your monitor to your liking with xrandr\n\n*Store your configuration with autorandr --save work (I'm storing my work config, choose a name that suits you)\n\n*Resume the config with autorandr --change work to choose config, or just autorandr --change to have it infer your config from your connected monitors.\n\nXDG autostart .desktop is also provided, and installed into /etc/xdg/autostart/autorandr.desktop by default. When you reconnect your work monitor, the work setup will be reloaded.\n\nA: You have several choices but perhaps the easiest is to place your command exactly as you have given above in your $HOME/.xprofile file. From this location it will be executed every time you login.\nBy default this file does not exist in Ubuntu and so may need to be created manually and then be made executable. The following commands will do this:\ntouch $HOME/.xprofile\nchmod +x $HOME/.xprofile\n\nNote the 2 small shortcomings of this method:\n\n*\n\n*.xprofile is accessed occurs fairly late in the startup process so you may see some initial screen resolution resizing\n\n*This is a 'per user' setting and may need to be repeated for other users on your system\n\nIf you wish to delve deeper there are a few other choices available in the reference link below, but the technique I have described here is still the safest and easiest.\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*Setting xrandr changes persistently\n\nA: You can use the autostart directory to apply the right xrandr settings when starting up the graphical environment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the xrandr command to use. For example when using the GUI tool arandr, you can do \"Layout → Save As …\" and then open that file to find the command.\n\n*Use your desktop environment's configuration GUI to set up a custom autostart application with the xrandr command you found.\n\n*Restart the computer to see the effect.\nAlternatively to no. 2, you can do the exact same thing manually by creating a file ~/.config/autostart/xrandr-settings.desktop with the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nVersion=1.0\nName=custom xrandr settings\n\n# Replace with your own xrandr command:\nExec=xrandr --output LVDS-1 --pos 0x1024 --output VGA-1 --pos 0x0\n\n\nAdvantages, Details\nI like this mechanism better than putting the command into $HOME/.xprofile as proposed in another answer. Because pretty surely the autostart directory will already contain entries provided or even required by the desktop environment, and this way I have all autostarted stuff incl. xrandr together in one place rather than having to figure out where something is autostarted if I ever want to change it.\nThe autostart directory is a FreeDesktop mechanism, so it should work in all major Linux desktop environments. From another answer (by villapx, licenced under CC-BY-SA 4.0):\n\nThe autostart directory is a part of the freedesktop.org/XDG Desktop Application Autostart Specification. Per that spec, a compliant desktop environment will search $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autostart for any .desktop files and execute them on startup.\n\n\nA: Finally, after endlessly mucking around with xrandr and .xprofile and .xinitrc and /etc/xorg.conf, none of which worked for the greeter or would stick permanently, this is what worked:\nNote the path is /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/\nCreate a new file 10-my-monitor.conf there...\n# sudo vi /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-my-monitor.conf\n\nAnd include the screen and monitor fragment of the xorg.conf.\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier  \"LGThing\"\n    Modeline    \"FourK30\" 338.75  3840 4080 4488 5136  2160 2163 2168 2200 -hsync +vsync\n    Option      \"PreferredMode\" \"FourK30\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier  \"MyScreen\"\n    Monitor     \"LGThing\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    SubSection  \"Display\"\n        Modes     \"FourK30\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\n\nI got the modeline from cvt.\n\nA: None of the answers here worked for me. I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 and gdm3 as display manager. This is how I persisted configuration across reboots and user sessions. I saved the xrandr command to a file '~/.config/autostart/setup_monitor_display.desktop', made it executable with chmod +x.\n# Wait until GUI is ready\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=1\nxrandr --output DP-0 --rotate left\n\nThen I added the execution of the script to the startup application list.\n\n*\n\n*Open Startup Application Preferences\n\n*Click Add\n\n*Fill in the name and comment\n\n*For command do something like sh -c '~/.config/autostart/setup_monitor_display.desktop'\nBased off the answer here: https://askubuntu.com/a/1230863/1152625\n", "Q: 6700HQ Ubuntu install broken bios suspected/CPU lockup xx seconds So I have tried to get Ubuntu to boot/install on my MSI Apache GE72 6QF.\nAfter weeks of trying and searching on google I have found MY solution that I found on a high tech site documented.\nWhen I tried to boot Ubuntu 15.04 (or any other version for that matter) I got either the \n\nBroken bios suspected\n\nerror, or\n\nCPU soft lockup 22 seconds\n\nerror.\nNo solution has worked so far for me, and I have tried them all...\n\nA: You should go into BIOS and DISABLE C-States, this means that your CPU will not be able to turn off when not in use, increasing power usage but fixing your issue.\nIf you do not have the C-States setting in your laptop, update your BIOS.\nThis working PERFECTLY for me, and I also found out that this will be fixed in the next few kernel updates.\nI also read that it is a fault in the processor microcode (dont quote me on this though)\nEDIT 07-04 It seems that 15.10 works as well, 15.10 also fixes the ACPI error which causes the PC to not shutdown properly in 15.04\n", "Q: remap the top number keys to use the symbols and numbers with the shift key As a developer I often have to write a lot of % $ # symbols in my code.  It is extra work over a day to keep hitting shift so obviously this will be a real functional improvement for programming to remap the top row of number keys to the symbols by default and the number via plus shift.  I have a numeric keypad that I use for numbers.  I do see a few posts on how to re-map the shift keys but that is not what I want to do.  I also have tried to use xev but I'm not sure if it understands what shift+1 is like is it just telling me what the shift key is?  Anyway it would be really sweet if there is a simple gui to do this but if not I can rewrite a preference file.  Thanks!\n\nA: There is a gui tool to remap keys. It is called dconf-tools (install via apt). Under org -> gnome -> desktop -> input-sources there are xkb-options. I used this to switch escape and capslock. \nEDIT: go to /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols . There you'll find abbreviations for different languages. Open your language with sudo nano ... In the file you'll see lines like: '1, exclam, ...' just put the command for the symbol first and the number second and it will be switched around.\n", "Q: How can I boot Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS from the USB port? I got ubuntu desktop. I want to test it from the USB port on my HP desktop. The download file was ubuntu-14.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso. I transferred this file to the flash drive on my USB port.  When I try to boot from this file I get \"BOOTMGR is missing\". Any idea why I can't boot from this file?\n\nA: You cannot boot from an iso placed on media, it has to be written to it. You're comparatively trying to utilize files from an archive without extracting first. Universal USB Installer is a user friendly tool to help write the image to portable media. After installing, insert your USB drive and follow the 1-2-3 design and allow several minutes for writing. Afterwards, place the USB in the desired computer and change the boot order to boot from USB. If that option is not available you must enable booting from USB from your BIOS. During this process you shouldn't see BOOTMGR is missing. Bootmgr is the Windows bootloader and will not play a part in the operation. You should be running Trusty Tahr in no time.\n", "Q: Blank Desktop after Login on Ubuntu 14.04 I rebooted my system and receive a blank desktop after logging in. on getting into the shell with ctrl + alt + F1 and doing a \"df\" i see that my root partition is full with 100% usage. \nI dont want to loose any data , how can i get my desktop back . Can someone please guide me through this. \n\nA: I managed to solve this problem eventually. \nso the weird part was that as soon as i deleted a few files which were a bit large enough to free off some space, the space magically got occupied again after about 30 seconds. \nWe finally found a large file of about 70G which were the CUPS logs.

I just install this packet on my Ubuntu 14.04 desktop system for a university project and I want to know if my computer is serving as a relay client for the Tor network.\n\nA: First is to ask yourself if you edited the configuration file torrc. If not,  Tor will be running as client (not relay).\nIf you did it depends on what settings you made. One easy way to check it is visiting https://atlas.torproject.org or https://globe.torproject.org. if you enter your ip address it looks into the database of all relays and tells you if your ip address is listed as relay. If it happened in the past go to https://exonerator.torproject.org and enter ip address and date.

So even if you configure NAT on the 10.x.x.x switch, the nodes will try to contact the MAAS server to reach internet.\nTake a look at these issues:\nhttps://github.com/Ubuntu-Solutions-Engineering/openstack-installer/issues/883\nhttps://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-openstack/issues/235\n\nA: I got similar issue... showing no route to host when i tried to deploy service to my juju node(including bootstrap node)\ninitially everything is ok..i can deploy without any issue.\nBut after I enable node1(ready state in MAAS) eth1(go to internet by using dhcp, using NAT from my host machine) .. all my deployment are failed.\n[all showing:\\2016-08-10 08:57:29 ERROR juju.cmd supercommand.go:429 cannot add unit 1/1 to service \"mediawiki\": cannot add unit to service \"mediawiki\": Get http://192.168.122.3/MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/?op=list&status=0&status=1&status=4&status=5&status=10: dial tcp 192.168.122.3:80: no route to host\n}\n192.168.122.3 is my MAAS public IP.\nthen later I notice i even can not telnet 192.168.122.3 80 from other nodes.\nSo I stop the eth1 on one of the node then can deploy service successfully.\nhope it can help someone...\nif you have any question let me know.\n", "Q: Permission denied for ubuntu shell user to list home directories of users When I use shell I can't list the directories of local home users created by useradd or through virtual min  ls -ls /home/someuser/   permission denied\nbut I can list directories created by root.  what group I should add those users to safely without affecting security of web server.  I run separate php processes for each user and want to keep it from accessing any other place. \n\nA: You could make the root directory of the home directory world readable.  This wouldn't change the mode of the files or the other directories that is subdirectories of the instant home directory.\nYou could do this with:\n$ sudo chmod go+x /home/someuser\n\nThe above mode parameters are:\n\ng  - group access\no  - others/everyone else\nx  - execute (in this case directory access)\n\nIf you want to restrict a directory (the home directory to a specific group, for instance the default group of the web server you could set the group owner of the directory to www-data and use only the g of the command, leaving out the o for others as in:\n$ sudo chgrp www-data /home/someuser\n$ sudo chmod g+x /home/someuser\n\nIt might be more convenient to use the chmod go+x command for the root directory of the user and create a sub-directory of your php programs.\nBy the way, by default your web applications will be running under the www-data group.\n", "Q: Poor battery life I have relatively high discharge rate (about 14W, which results in ~3 hours of battery life) on my ThinkPad X230.

While this is not spectacular, it can not possibly be considered high. On a Lenovo T420 I had discharge rates in excess of 30 W.\nThe first problem you have is a degraded battery. As new, this 9 cell model boasts 94 Wh of storage, which at a discharge rate of 11 W should last in excess of 8 hours. If now it lasts just over 3 hours, the battery capacity is down to something above 30 Wh. Yes, Lithium batteries can degrade that fast.\nYour second problem is a less than optimal power management on Lenovo models by the Linux kernel shipped with 14.04. I reported this as a bug for the T420. You can follow the instructions there to try the mainline kernel and see if it helps. However, a different Linux kernel will never restore back the 60 Wh your battery has already lost.\n", "Q: importerror: no module named bootstrap3_datetime While runing \"python manage.py migrate\"\n i got error \"importerror: no module named bootstrap3_datetime\"\nbut in my pip freeze it is installed. \ndjango-bootstrap3==7.0.1\n\nA: This is most likely a spelling mistake in your INSTALLED_APPS.

The 4.2.0 kernel came out at the same time, so development for it was before board and CPU were widely available. Mint 17.3 is based on Ubuntu Trusty, which is even older.\nTry with a Live CD of Ubuntu Xenial to see if your hardware is better supported by kernel 4.4.0. If you want to have the latest hardware, you better run the latest Linux on it for best support.\nEven the current beta of 16.04 probably is a better fit for your system, with less issues.\nEDIT: To have a quick fix for the issue at hand, do sudo echo \"disable\" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe6F. This should temporarily disable the GPE and get rid of the messages. You probably need a BIOS update to fix the issue.\n", "Q: public folder not found ubuntu 14.04 I had all my code(softwares) in my Public folder.

Have I lost all my data? \n\nA: Before you write too much to the drive, you want to try a data recovery tool. This isn't going to be quick.\nI would suggest you reboot the PC from a CD or USB drive, ideally plug in a large USB drive, and install 'foremost' - run this, tell it to place recovered files on the USB backup drive, run it - it's a command line tool, type foremost from a terminal.\nThis should put ALL recognised files in the USB, untitled & grouped by filetype - you can find filenames later, but at least it retrieves your hard work. It won't separate .c, .h, etc, they'll be 'text' files. It will possibly take days if your system drive was full!\n", "Q: Differing kernel versions for 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the same OS?

Now you can install the AMD drivers from the Additional Drivers tab. Alternatively you can install the proprietary drivers by using the terminal, open a terminal and execute the following commands:  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install fglrx  \nsudo reboot  \n\nUpdate addressing your comment that the open source drivers prevent you from installing:\nWhen booting from the installation media, select Try Ubuntu without installing, press the E key and add radeon.modeset=0 at the end of the linux line ... press F10 to boot. Install Ubuntu.  \nReboot - select the Ubuntu menu entry, press the E key and add radeon.modeset=0 at the end of the linux line ... press F10 to boot. Install the proprietary AMD drivers as described before.  \nImportant : Put a Space between the last character of the linux line and radeon.modeset=0.\nAfter the proprietary AMD drivers are installed, adding the boot parameter is not necessary.  \nNote: fglrx will not be available in the repositories of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, which will be released in a few days, so when you want to upgrade you may want to consider not to install these drivers. Ubuntu 16.04 most probably will offer the new amdgpu (replacement) drivers in the repositories.  \nAs a workaround you can can deactivate the radeon open source drivers by adding the parameter to the /etc/default/grub file, so that the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" line reads -> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.modeset=0\". Save these changes you have made and update GRUB afterwards - open a terminal and execute: sudo update-grub.\n\nA: Perhaps it is a better option to wait for 16.04 LTS - Kernel 4.4/4.5 bring much better support for highend-gpus to you with the new amdgpu-driver . So there will be no need for fglrx on 16.04.\nRonny\n", "Q: MySql Installation problem in dual boot ubuntu 14.04 I am getting an E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) error when installing mysql 5.6 in Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nI have tried to modified\n\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/mysql-server-5.6.postinst and comment out line 95:\n/usr/share/mysql-common/configure-symlinks install mysql  \"$mysql_cfgdir/mysql.cnf\"\n\nbut i did not find the\n\n/usr/share/mysql-common/configure-symlinks install mysql  \"$mysql_cfgdir/mysql.cnf\" line\n\n\nA: Reinstall it using the cmd on terminal \nsudo apt-get purge mysql-server-5.6\nthen \nsudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.6\n", "Q: How can the speed of an AVI file be changed? I want to change the speed of an AVI video file such that it takes twice as long to play as it did originally. I have attempted to do this with ffmpeg, but this results in a very low quality video:\nffmpeg -i in.avi -filter:v \"setpts=2.0*PTS\" out.avi\n\nHow should this be done on Ubuntu 15.10 without this loss of quality?\n\nA: I suspect that your copy of FFmpeg is also re-encoding using the defaults for the avi container, which can be a little unforgiving. Try running the following simple additions to your commandline:\nffmpeg -i in.avi \\\n       -filter:v \"setpts=2.0*PTS\" \\\n       -c:v mpeg4 -q:v 2 \\\n       -an \\\n       out.avi\n\nThe driving part of this commandline is the 'quality' setting: -q:v 2 which can be set from 1-31 with the highest quality being 1 and the lowest being 31. Note as well that I have used -an to bar use of the audio stream.\nIf this effectively increases the quality of your output video you could consider adding the following flags to your video line:\n-vtag XVID -f avi -mbd rd -flags +mv4+aic -trellis 2 -cmp 2 -subcmp 2 -g 300\n\nI routinely use these flags when encoding for an older device and they do produce a significantly better result...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*FFmpeg Trac: MPEG-4 Encoding Guide\n\n*FFmpeg Trac: Speeding up/slowing down video\n\nA: for me it worked very well using this command:\nffmpeg -i in.mp4 \\\n   -filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=0.50*PTS[v];[0:a]atempo=2.00[a]\" \\\n   -map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" out.mp4\n\nNote: setpts=0.50 == 2x and the atempo must be 1/setpts == 2.0.

Playing around with acerhdf looks even more difficult.\nIf your BIOS supports supports fan control enabling this and removing any fan control software you have installed is the safest way of getting effective fan control.\nIf the BIOS does not feature fan control (most modern laptops BIOS do), then you need to get lm-sensors and fancontrol working.

I can reach the VM perfectly fine via SSH, so there's no immediate problem. I was just wondering what's preventing Xenial from showing login prompt on KVM VNC port?\nThere is just one message log line in console:\n/dev/vda1: clean, 60259/917504 files, 360205/3669760 blocks\nbut no login prompt?\n\nA: It seems that Xenial tends to show the graphical console (tty7) after boot - which is unfortunately empty, except for the line quoted above.\nYou can 'fix' this immediately by hitting Ctrl-Alt-1 to switch to tty1, which is a text console.\nTo make this permanent, add a line like this to /etc/default/grub:\n GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text\n\nSave and perform:\n update-grub\n\nThis makes grub tell Linux to use the \"text\" console after boot.\n\nA: I came across this and it seemed to be related to the kernel version. I had tried to take a short-cut by using a script I always use for provisioning headless VMs with a recent Ubuntu KVM image, and then adding I would 'apt-get' the desktop components afterwards. It nearly worked. GDM would start but Xorg couldn't find /dev/tty1, and there was no console output either terminal or graphical. Just a flashing cursor in top-left.\nI was able to work around this. I installed the -generic version of the kernel, rebooted and removed the -kvm version. This got me further, and I then used tasksel to try switching it's purpose further, but I suffered a network disconnection half-way through the install so it all got messy/inconsistent. I couldn't re-connect via SSH.\nI might have got further if had I kept trying, but I had already spent longer on the short-cut than expected, so I just downloaded a recent Desktop CD, mounted it into the VM and re-installed using the old-school ISO installer.\n", "Q: Unable to install Ubuntu on Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 4th Generation General Goal\nI've spend about 2 full days on this issue by now.

As explained in the Reddit thread. The solution was to deactivate intel_pstate in the kernel boot parameters.\n\nWhat I did not get, was how to modify the boot parameters manually for the Ubuntu Startup-USB. This is done by entering the F6 menu and exit the menu right away. Now there is a new line visible on the screen. This line can be edited by pressing e add the command intel_pstate=no_hwp (for example after quiet). Now you can install Ubuntu.

That is, only NVidia proprietary drivers seem to work with this card, for now at least.\nNow everything is working fine, but  I would like to have the option to selectively use the NVidia GPU for graphics intensive tasks, otherwise have it off.

Has anyone tried Bumblebee with this card? Does it work fine?\nWhat exactly do I need to install to get Bumblebee working?\nI am on Ubuntu trusty, 14.04.\n\nA: Yes, Bumblebee should work fine with your card (Bumblebee supports whatever Nvidia or nouveau do). Do not hesitate to seek for help on the bugtracker. They are some known issues, but most of them should be fixed in the coming release (for which a pre-version is available through our testing PPA. You might potentially also have some issues with bbswitch (the power management part of it), but those should be solved soon with the coming 1.0 release.\n@Zacharee1: You’ve probably tried to use bumblebee-ui, which is so deprecated that we even deleted the repo to prevent other people trying to use it. The only way to use Bumblebee is through optirun, there is no “add apps to anything” thing. You might eventually edit your .desktop files or create alias in your .bashrc (or .whatevershellrc) to add optirun at the beginning of the appropriate commands.

I am thinking of getting a SSD though but I have no idea wether to get Sata III or less\n\nA: You might check in your BIOS to see if you have a hyperthreading option and if so if it is enabled.  Hyperthreading can give a performance boost, and I believe some of the P4's had hyper-threading technologies.\nEven at that, with only 1GB of Ram, it's doable, but you would be better with a lighter desktop environment.  You could try looking up xfce, kde, or even lxde if you need something quite light.  In my opinion with lxde and even a single thread p4 with 1gb of ram it should be usable, depending, of course, what you're using it for.\nUbuntu 16.04 should be out soon, so another thing you could try would be doing a fresh install of server 16.04 minimally when it comes out and installing lxde on top of that.  You should have a fairly stable, quite light installation which can run the most modern programs in the new software center.\nAnother side note: I would not recommend reinstalling XP even if you can get your hands on an old installation : it's support is expired and security is a major risk unless you use it strictly offline.\n", "Q: I cannot launch the Steam game Snow The Steam game Snow is stuck on “Preparing to launch” for me; reinstalling the game did not fix the issue.

However there is something I can't quite get to work the way I could in tmux.\nI want to make it so that Ctrl-a \"arrow key\" changes focus between my windows. I typically have many splits in my terminal window.\nI've searched around but been unable to find a config that works. Note I do not want to switch between windows, just the focus.\nBonus points if someone could explain the difference between \"bind\" and \"bindkey\" to my addled brain.\nCheers\n\nA: Since :bind will not accept weird virtual characters like the arrow-keys — only keypresses that have ASCII-codes or stuff like ctrlthingThatHasAsciiCode — I think using :bindkey is the simplest way to get what you're after. For me, the following worked under GNU screen 4.06.01 in xterm and could be added either into \"~/.screenrc\" (affects just you) or \"/etc/screenrc\" (meant to apply system-wide):\n# ctrlA then right-arrow-key jumps active cursor one pane to the right:\nbindkey \"^A^[OC\" focus right\n\n# ctrlA then left-arrow-key jumps active cursor one pane to the left:\nbindkey \"^A^[OD\" focus left\n\n# ctrlA then up-arrow-key jumps active cursor one pane above current:\nbindkey \"^A^[OA\" focus up\n\n# ctrlA then up-arrow-key jumps active cursor one pane below current:\nbindkey \"^A^[OB\" focus down\n\nDepending on your terminal and settings, the codes you need to place after the \"^A\" may be different for you. To determine what these codes are, I prefer to use vim; open it and then press i to enter edit-mode, then press ctrlv to take raw input, then hit the key or key-combination in question * **.\nWhen you use my approach, you'll need to type your ctrlarrowKey command fairly swiftly; screen stops listening for custom bindings if you pause for too long between keystrokes. If it's expiring too quickly, use :bindkey -t instead of :bindkey to disable the timer.\n* Note that unlike in vim, screen will not like it if you insert the actual metacharacter escapes into \".screenrc\" or other files you might source; simply use literal, individual '^' and '[', not the weird combined version that vim can output (at least, that seemed to screw things up for me).\n** Some people determine special key-codes by running cat (by itself) in the terminal, and then pressing the key(s) in question (before using ctrlc to quit). I don't use this approach so YMMV.\n", "Q: New Ubuntu dual boot partition question First, thanks for the help getting me started.  After searching in the help files for a while I couldn't find the answer.\nI am trying to install Ubuntu in a dual boot environment along side win xp.  I have two hds, one with xp on it and the second, a 120g, is mainly used as additional storage space.  The second drive is where I would like to install Ubuntu.  I would also like to be able to use that second drive for storage after the ubuntu install. Right now it has files on it but they can be moved/deleted.  If my searching is correct, I need to create a / partition, a swap partition, a /home partition, and then a final partition for data for both xp and ubuntu to see. \nAm I correct in the above reasoning and what sizes should I use?  Its my understanding I should use FAT to format the data storage space that both OS will use, correct?  Thanks again.\n\nA: You're asking a lot of questions, but I will try to fit all the answers into one.\nDo you need a / (root) partition? Yes.\nDo you need a /home partition? No. You may create one, but I don't see a requirement for one (from what you've written).\nDo you need a swap partition? No, this is not strictly needed, but I would suggest that you make one.\nDo you need a final partition for data for both XP and Ubuntu to see? This is not required if all you need is to be able to share files between the two operating systems. Ubuntu comes with a fine NTFS driver that will allow you to read and write from the partition Windows XP is installed on. If you would like to share data between the two on the second drive, then yes this is needed.\nShould the data partition be formatted FAT? You might as well format it NTFS, as it allows for larger individual files and can works fine from Ubuntu.\nWhat sizes should you use? This one is rather hard. I'd make the swap partition about the same size as the amount of memory the machine has. If making the data partition, you will need to decide how much space you want to reserve for both operating systems. You can make your root partition (in this case your only 'linux only' partition) as little as 10GB (even smaller if you want), but I'd recommend at least 20 or 30. It really depends on your needs.\n", "Q: How to run GUI applications as root UPDATE\n\nI would like to know which is the recommend way of running GUI applications as root, mainly because what I'm trying isn't running smoothly. I get some annoying warnings that makes me think whether I'm doing something wrong or not.\nI'm using gksudo and sudo -i, which I understand, are doing the same thing. Please let me know if there is some slight differences between them.\nRegarding the problems I'm experiencing, I would like to start with nautilus (run as root). I can't edit the preferences file maybe because the program couldn't create its own configuration files. A warning says that the folder /root/.config/nautilus must be created. When you start an application for the first time, the program is responsible for creating the configuration files it will potentially need. So, when you are running as root, it should happen the same, shouldn't it?\nFurthermore, in the shell appears some strange warnings while running this application, such as the followings:\n\n(nautilus:3406): Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to register client: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by any .service files\nNautilus-Share-Message: Called \"net usershare info\" but it failed: The \"shared network\" returned error 255: net usershare: cannot open usershare directory /var/lib/samba/usershares. Error It doesn't exist the file or the folder\nPlease ask your system administrator to enable user sharing.\n\nOther applications like gedit or firefox complained in this way:\n\n(gedit:3444): Gtk-WARNING **: Calling Inhibit failed: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by any .service files\n(gedit:3444): GLib-GIO-WARNING **: Failed to parse translated string ''Monospace 12'' for key 'editor-font' in schema 'org.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor': 0:expected value\n(gedit:3444): GLib-GIO-WARNING **: Using untranslated default instead.\n(firefox:2719): Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_clipboard_set_with_data: assertion 'targets != NULL\n\nI want to make a clean install of the system soon, but before that, I would like to understand how it works in case I need this stuff in the future for specific things. Though I know it's safer to use the straight sudo in the command line instead.\nWhy this is happening? Thanks in advance\n\nA: The issue with using a straight sudo nautilus is that it will sometimes try to use configuration files from your user's home directory.  This can cause root (superpriviledged user) to change permissions on files within your home directory.  This is not usually harmful long-term; it can cause annoying problems like refusing to login to your desktop, but you can usually restore previous configurations by typing:\nsudo chown -R user:user ~/\n\nSo what gksudo and sudo -i do is simply to tell the program to run with either copies of .Xauthority and other configuration files or with ones that actually belong to root.  I personally prefer sudo -i so I don't have to type in my password every time, but it's totally preference.  The two commands are doing the same thing.\n", "Q: I need Ubuntu.Components 1.3 for Ubuntu 14.04 Newbie here.  Been an IAR baremetal embedded guy for years.

There simply is no other option then that these launchers are located there.\nWhat can be misleading however is that the filename of a .desktop file does not necessarily show the interface name of the application, as it appears in Dash. To find out, you can make suspected launchers executable (in nautilus, right- click on the icon > properties). Once the file is executable, its icon will then show what they represent, and the displayed name will be according to the name in Dash.\nAnother option is to run:\ngrep -iR reaper ~/.local/share/applications/\n\nTo see which of the files contains your application's name.\nN.B.\nThe ~ (tilde) stands for /home/yourname.

It doesn't keep track of charge/discharge cycles, but with some edit you can add this feature.\n#! /bin/bash\n\n# read battery percentage value\nOUT=`upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | grep percentage`\n\n# select only the int value\nIFS=':' read -ra P <<< \"$OUT\"\nPERCENTAGE=\"%\"\nBATTERY_VALUE=${P[1]%$PERCENTAGE}\n\n# send a notification and play sound if battery level is under 10%\nif (( $BATTERY_VALUE  < \"10\")); then\n  notify-send \"Battery Low level! You need to plug your PC!\"\n\n# command to play sound - you can select your preferred sound if this doesn't work\n  paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga\nfi\n\n# send a notification and play sound if battery level is equal to 100%\nif (( $BATTERY_VALUE  >= \"100\")); then\n  notify-send \"Battery charged! You can now unplug your PC!\"\n  paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga\nfi\n\nCopy this script into a bash file and move it into local bin folder:\nsudo mv <script_file> /usr/local/bin/\n\nWhere script_file is the name (or path) of your script. Then you can use cron daemon to run it every 5 minutes to check battery level. So edit cron:\ncrontab -e\n\nSelect preferred editor and add at the end of file this line:\n*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/<script_file>\n\nChange script_file with your script name.\nNow it should work. Check it after a system reboot.\nI hope to be useful.\n\nA: You can use this script as I was stuck today on the same problem. \nYou can think of this script as an upgrade to the script given by @Danibix.\nThe script below uses systemd service as to restart itself even if the process is killed.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Run this script as a cronjob every 5 minutes or so, to get notifications when\n# battery percentage goes below 30% or above 80%.

WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.\nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\nIf these changes do not help, please try:\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\nsudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=8\n\nIf it helps, make it permanent:\nsudo -i\necho \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\nexit\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu phone (Aquarius 4.5) change of UMTS frequency I recently moved from Switzerland to Colombia.

However, when I try to tar a large number of files (about 400,000) via the command:\ntar cvf archive.tar folder\n\nIt take about 2 hours. When I execute the same command on my computer, which has a similar spec, but less RAM, it takes about 5 minutes to tar a similar batch of files.\nDoes anyone have any ideas or alternatives? The command line outputs a list of all the files. I don't know if this causes issues.\n\nA: Disk fragmentation.  If they are large files you can use filefrag to check how fragmented the individual files are, but there is another kind of fragmentation that tends to happen with many small files:  the order that the names appear in the directory may be completely different from the order that the inodes appear on disk, and that order may be completely different from the order of the data blocks on disk.  That means when you open all of the files in the order their names appear in the directory, the disk has to seek a lot and slows things down.  I wrote the following python script once to compute the correlation between names, inodes, and the first data block of all files in the current directory so you can measure this:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport os\nfrom stat import *\nimport fcntl\nimport array\n\nnames = os.listdir('.')\nlastino = 0\nname_to_ino_in = 0\nname_to_ino_out = 0\nlastblock = 0\nname_to_block_in = 0\nname_to_block_out = 0\niblocks = list()\ninode_to_block_in = 0\ninode_to_block_out = 0\n\nfor file in names :\n    try :\n        st = os.stat(file)\n    except OSError:\n        continue\n    if not S_ISREG(st.st_mode) :\n        continue\n    if st.st_ino > lastino :\n        name_to_ino_in += 1\n    else : name_to_ino_out += 1\n    lastino = st.st_ino    \n    f = open(file)\n    buf = array.array('I', [0])\n    err = fcntl.ioctl(f.fileno(), 1, buf)\n    if err != 0 :\n        print \"ioctl failed on \" + f\n    block = buf[0]\n    if block != 0 :\n        if block > lastblock :\n            name_to_block_in += 1\n        else : name_to_block_out += 1\n        lastblock = block\n        iblocks.append((st.st_ino,block))\nprint \"Name to inode correlation: \" + str(float(name_to_ino_in) / float((name_to_ino_in + name_to_ino_out)))\nprint \"Name to block correlation: \" + str(float(name_to_block_in) / float((name_to_block_in + name_to_block_out)))\niblocks.sort()\nlastblock = 0\nfor i in iblocks:\n    if i[1] > lastblock:\n        inode_to_block_in += 1\n    else: inode_to_block_out += 1\n    lastblock = i[1]\nprint \"Inode to block correlation: \" + str(float(inode_to_block_in) / float((inode_to_block_in + inode_to_block_out)))\n\nOld filesystems that have had many small files added over a long time tend to get in bad shape.  Simply copying the entire directory may result in the destination being much better, then you can delete the original and replace it with the copy.  The second problem that contributes to this though is ext4's htree indexed directory feature, which is used on directories with many files in them to make looking up an individual file name much faster, but essentially completely randomizes the order of the names.  You can check if a directory is using htrees with lsattr -d and look for the I attribute.\nOne of the reasons that I prefer to backup with dump instead of tar is that it is immune to this problem since it reads all of the files in inode order regardless of the order the names appear in the directory.  It still has to contend with the inode to block fragmentation though.  A copy or a pass of e2defrag can help with that.\n", "Q: How do I change the \"unsaved\" colour in Geany's open document tab? I haven't been able to find the location to change the colour I highlighted in the posted image.  It isn't in the installed Geany theme.  I think it has to do with Ubuntu's theme but I haven't been able to locate it.  It is so small I get inconsistent results when I use GIMP to extract the colour from it.  I can't find the exact hex code of the colour to help my search.\ncolour I want to change\nmy Ubuntu theme is in\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance-Blackout-XFCE-LXDE-Manila\n\nin that directory...\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance-Blackout-XFCE-LXDE-Manila\nDoes anyone know or have an idea the file in which I may find the colour?\n\nA: If you want to change the color of the text in the \"unsaved\" tab which seems to be \"startup.sh\", you don't need to know the current text color.\nGeany is still a gtk2 app. Your home folder should have a hidden file called .gtkrc-2.0. Open it and check if it has a line like this:\ninclude \"/home/your_login_name/.gtkrc-2.0.mine\"\n\nIf it does, just close ~/.gtkrc-2.0. If it doesn't, add that line at the very end, making sure you use the correct full path. Save and exit.\nIf you don't have a file called ~/.gtkrc-2.0, open a terminal, make sure you're in your home folder and run\necho \"include \\\"/home/your_login_name/.gtkrc-2.0.mine\\\"\" > .gtkrc-2.0\n\nBut make sure you change your_login_name to whatever is appropriate.\nNow, see if you also have a hidden file called ~/.gtkrc-2.0.mine. If you don't have the file, just create it using a plain text editor. If it already exists, back it up for safety and then add the following lines:\n# CUSTOM STYLES\n\n# *******GEANY*******\n#Styling text (fg) in Geany's tabs\n#Note that styling bg is done in the theme's gtkrc, not here, because we want that effect across other programs with tabs as well\n# document status colors\nstyle \"geany-document-status-changed-style\" {\n    fg[NORMAL] = \"magenta\" #tab text when changes are made but not saved and tab is active\n    fg[ACTIVE] = \"#ff0746\" #tab text when changes are made but not saved and tab is not in focus\n}\nwidget \"*.geany-document-status-changed\" \nstyle \"geany-document-status-changed-style\"\n# font style and size in Geany's tabs\nstyle \"geany\" = \"geany-tabs\" {\n    font_name = \"Ubuntu Mono 14\"\n}\nwidget \"GeanyMainWindow.GtkVBox.GtkVPaned.GtkHPaned.GtkNotebook.*\" \nstyle \"geany\" \n\nI've also included code to allow you to specify a font just for Geany's UI. You can delete or comment out those lines!\nSave the edited file (as plain text). Close all instances of Geany. Then, open Geany and check the effect of what you've done. Obviously, you'll want colors suited to your taste.\nHere's what I see.  \n\nAll the best.\n\nA: Condensing @tk-bose's solution to the OPs minimum... (just for convencience)\n$> cd ~\n$> cat .gtkrc (-<tab>, <tab>... nope, file does not exist..)\n\nThus let's continue with:\n$> echo \"include \\\"/home/(YOUR USERNAME)/.gtkrc-2.0.mine\\\"\" > .gtkrc-2.0      \n\n$> cat .gtkrc-2.0       (just to verify)\ninclude \"/home/(YOUR USERNAME)/.gtkrc-2.0.mine\"\n\nput in the content show below:\n$> pluma .gtkrc-2.0.mine    ( plume or nano or vi or any other editor)\n\nI took milder reds (assuming this blaring red was, what the OP disturbed, like me). And almost identical ones for focus/non-focus (given that saved tabs are also always white, active or not):\n# GEANNY custom styles - taken from askubuntu.com/q/754645\n\nstyle \"geany-document-status-changed-style\" {\n    fg[NORMAL] = \"#ff4d4d\" #unsaved tab active (aka in focus)\n    fg[ACTIVE] = \"#dd3d3d\" #unsaved tab not active\n}\nwidget \"*.geany-document-status-changed\" \nstyle \"geany-document-status-changed-style\"\n\n\nA: The two solutions above did not work for me.
