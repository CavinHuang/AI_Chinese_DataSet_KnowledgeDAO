["Q: How to type a blank password in terminal in Mac sierra I use Sudo commands  in terminal but it always asks for the password.This is annoying because I always have to set a password.So how do I type blank password in terminal in MacOS Sierra 10.12.5\n\nA: sudo in macOS requires a password, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202035\nSo it is not about typing it, it is sudo not accepting it. \n\nA: sudo is for executing a command with administrator privilege, so it obviously uses your administrator password which, as Monomeeth said, cannot be blank.\nHaving a one-letter password is highly unsecure, it is far to easily breakable.\nHowever, if you keep the same session (eg. not closing the terminal), you won't have to type your password every time.\n\nA: This method allows you to sudo without entering your password. \nThis means you can (you should!) use a strong password to log into your mac, but can then sudo in terminal without re-entering it all the time.\nyou need to edit the /etc/sudoers file with the visudo command (type sudo visudo at the command prompt) and change the line\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nto \n%admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nBEWARE: Be sure to always \"lock\" your mac when you step away, anybody (who knows how..) can do wild things, with the sudo option configured like this!\n", "Q: Can I publish a \"coming soon\" version of my application? (e.g. information regarding the upcoming service, ability to reserve a spot) I read the Apple submission guidelines and it states that trials, demos, or betas will be rejected. However, if I'm offering a service and it isn't ready yet, but I want to get people familiar with the name, can I release a \"soft\" version of the application which tells users about the upcoming service and the ability to reserve a spot?\nTo reiterate, I am building a service which will release sometime later this year, hopefully. However, I would like to gather interested users and give them information about it and the ability to join a mailing list, create an account, connect on social media through a simplistic app (under the same name). Is this allowed?\nI would like some clarification, if possible.\nThank you\n\nA: As long as you're releasing a functioning app that works, I can't see a reason why it wouldn't be approved.\nHowever, this assumes that the app actually serves a purpose in its current state and that all you're doing is including additional info such as Coming soon etc.\nIf Apple does have an issue with the current version, you'll receive an email from iTunes Connect advising you that the App Store Review team have sent you a message and you can view and respond to it via the Resolution Centre. Typically this gives you the chance to address their concerns and, if necessary, to make changes.\nEven if they didn't give you this opportunity, you can always resubmit the app once you've updated it.\n", "Q: Unable to see my contacts I am unable to see my contacts since few days.

As part of a family 'computer shuffle/switcheroo' I'm thinking of repurposing a Mac Mini as a media-server running iTunes (to feed our library of video content to our Apple TVs). However, I will need to store the iTunes library on an external hard drive since the Mac Mini has only a 500GB internal drive and the iTunes library currently exceeds 1TB.\nObviously I would want the iTunes library backed up; all our family computers are backed up to a single 3TB Time Capsule. My concern is whether or not the external drive with the iTunes library would get backed up; AFAIK external drives do not get backed up via Time Machine (am I correct about that?), but I wondered if the the linkage between the iTunes app (residing on the Mac Mini) and its library (on the external) would maybe provide a bridge that would allow the iTunes library to be included in the backup.\nCan anyone advise? Thanks.\n\nA: Yes, Time Machine will backup external drives as well. Just make sure that the drive is not excluded in the settings:\nSystem Preferences > Time Machine > Options…\n", "Q: How do I combine separate cells in a Numbers spreadsheet and paste the result as text into a TextEdit document?

I'm considering buying the LG Ultrafine 5k and I'm wondering, will I be able to use the display with my 2012 MBP?  I don't mind if I don't get full resolution while using the 2012, I just want to know if it will work.\n\nA: Firstly, the Ultrafine 5k only has thunderbolt 3 over USB-C inputs, so you'll need a thunderbolt 2 to USB-C cable to even connect. You should be able to run the monitor at a greatly reduced resolution which is then \"upscaled\" to 5k. For instance, many people run 4K monitors at 1080p, so the 5k should work at 1080p (or other resolutions <5K) as well. \nUpscaling is very common on TVs at the moment, since there is a lack of 4k content, and thus those watching 1080p content on 4k TVs must have their content upscaled. I've attached an article on C|Net discussing upscaling.  \nThus in principle it should work. I'd contact the manufacturer directly to make sure. That monitor is not cheap.\n\nA: I was connecting my old MBP mid-2015 to the LG Ultrafine 5k, and out of curiosity I also hooked up my old MBP 2012. Works like a charm running 2560x1440 resolution @ 60hz. Use a CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 dock and an Apple TB3 to TB2 adaptor.\n\nA: Officially the 2012 MBP isn't going to be able to use the LG UltraFine 5K. For more information you can read Use the LG UltraFine 5K Display with your Mac.\nNow, sometimes what Apple officially supports isn't the full story, so it may be you  could find a way to get this to work. Only you can decide if that's a risk worth taking.\n", "Q: Where are scanner drivers located, and what (file) form do they take? I'm attempting to make use of this scanner (Dymo Cardscan 800):\n\nIt has no generic or publicly available drivers for any version of MacOS (or Windows, for that matter). The makers intend for you to use their software... and yesterday I stumbled across a copy (demo, I get 100 scans before it locks me out). I tested it on Sierra, and it works.\nIn the dotapp bundle, I see several executables. Only one is executable from the command line. That one just launches the application, gui and all.\nHowever, in the Frameworks folder, there is one named \"Alpha.framework\". And within that, I have another Resource bundle for it named \"alpha.drv.bundle\". It's just a resource bundle, but in it are a bunch of .string files, which have error messages you might expect out of a scanner driver.\nI was wondering if this was some internal driver that could maybe be extracted and used generally. But I have no clue where scanner drivers are in the OS, or what form they take.\nUsing the proprietary software (even were I to buy a license) would be miserable... it doesn't save the scans. It OCRs them immediately, deletes the image file, and that's it (found where it puts the image file... I see it flicker into existence and then it's gone before you can click). Hoping for a minor miracle.\n\nA: Scanner drivers are located in /Library/Image Capture/Devices/ as Tetsujin so helpfully points out.\nThese scanner drivers are App bundles, but quite a bit different than regular applications. An executable binary is inside Contents/MacOS, along with the obligatory plists, Resources, etc. Even so, they're typically quite a bit more barren than an actual Application bundle.\nIf Tetsujin wants to include an answer here, please upvote his rather than mine since mine is basically just repeating information that I got from him.\n", "Q: Size of Xcode app seems too big at over 12GB?

I understand the value may be different on the App Store but this seems like a huge difference. Is this 12 GB size accurate?\n\nA: App Store sizes are reported as the compressed download, which for Xcode is around 5 GB. Once downloaded, uncompressed and installed, over 10 GB is the size observed in Finder.\n", "Q: When using a third-party script library, I can no longer save an AppleScript file in Script Editor.app I have an AppleScript .scpt file that uses the Dialog Toolkit scripting library:\n\nDialog Toolkit is an ASObjC-based script library for showing enhanced dialogs.\n\nThe following line is at the top of the .scpt file:\nuse script \"Dialog Toolkit\" version \"2.0\"\n\nThe Dialog Toolkit file is in the correct location:\n\n/Users/Me/Library/Script Libraries/Dialog Toolkit.scptd\n\nHowever, when I try to save my .scpt file in Script Editor.app, I am given the following message:\n\nThe dialog reads:\n\nThe document “Untitled.scpt” could not be saved. C and Objective-C pointers cannot be saved in scripts.\nCompiling the script will reset property values and may resolve this issue.\n\nI don't know the meaning of \"C and Objective-C pointers\", so I don't understand the problem.\nI can successfully run and compile the script. But, after I compile the script, I still cannot save the file; I still get the above error message.\nIf I copy the full code and paste it into a New Document in Script Editor, the error still persists.\nIf I remove all of the Dialog Toolkit code from my script, then I can save the .scpt file, without error. Hence, it seems that the issue has something to do with how Script Editor handles an external script library.\n\nAlso, I have noticed general \"bugginess\" when working on my script that contains Dialog Toolkit code in Script Editor.\n\n\n*\n\n*For example, sometimes Script Editor.app will spontaneously quit if the document is open.\n\n*Other times, when I press the \"Compile the Script\" or \"Run the Script\" button, my cursor transforms into the spinning pinwheel, and remains as a pinwheel for over a minute. Script Editor freezes up, so I then have to Force Quit Script Editor.\n\nThere is some chance that this question is related to a previous question of mine:\n\n\n*\n\n*I suddenly cannot open any files in Script Editor.app\nEverything that is listed in the \"What I've tried:\" section of the above question also failed to fix the The document could not be saved. error.\n\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \nScript Editor Version 2.8.1 (183.1) \n\nA: First thing I would try is opening up the scripteditor.app library panel. \nIn Scripteditor go to menu item \"Window/Library\"\n\nIf dialog toolkit is present in the list, I would select it in the list and remove it.  Then I would quit scripteditor.app and relaunch it again. Once scripteditor.app is up and running again, Open the Library panel and click on the “Add” button in the menu bar and navigate to ~/Library/Script Libraries and select Dialog Toolkit.scptd.\nThat will probably solve your problem.  I have a funny feeling the problem is occurring because your new com.apple.ScriptEditor2.plist file probably does not contain any reference to the Dialog Toolkit.scptd as per this example in this image..\nThis is com.apple.ScriptEditor2.plist file opened in xcode\n\n", "Q: Jailbroken using yalu102 without Cydia and can't install Cydia because \"already jailbroken\" I recently jailbroke my iOS 10.1.1 iPad mini 2 with yalu102, and I erased all content and settings for some weird reason.

If I'm planning to play games on it, will it decrease my fps? Also, can I run window games on the monitor?\n\nA: When playing games, there are two things which determine your \"real\" fps, i.e., the number of unique or distinct frames you actually see.\nFirstly, the monitor has a built in \"refresh rate,\" which is the fastest speed at which the pixels may change color. The refresh rate never changes, no matter what your computer is doing. For most monitors this is 60hz, although high end \"gaming\" monitors may have refresh rates as high as 144Hz.\nThe second thing you have to consider, is how many FPS your computer is able to send to the monitor. This is determined by your graphics card (GPU), CPU, RAM, and Hard Drive in that order. Depending on how demanding the game is, the number of FPS your computer will send to the monitor will change. The more demanding the game the less FPS. For example Battlefield 1 and Ashes of the Singularity are very demanding games, Overwatch is semi demanding, and angry birds or candy crush, are not demanding. Macs tend to have very weak GPUs\nThe number of FPS you actually see is whichever is less, the Refresh Rate, or the FPS output by the computer. For example, if your monitor is 60Hz, but your computer is only outputting 25FPS, you only really get 25FPS.\nFinally, the monitor only displays the images your computer sends to it. So in a sense, you can't play any games \"on it.\" However, if you connect a windows computer to the Samsung monitor, or install a Windows partition on your Mac via Bootcamp and connect it to the monitor, then you can view your Windows games on the monitor.\n", "Q: How to insert a vector notation in Keynote/Pages?

And if so, any suggestions on a fix other than taking it back to the apple store for expensive fix?\n\nA: If trying to use the Audio Midi Setup (as suggested in comments by Tetsujin) doesn't help, your next step would be to run Apple Diagnostics.\nRun Apple Diagnostics \nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac \n\n*Restart your Mac \n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear \n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes) \n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen: \n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message \n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions \n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are \n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n\nA: So as an update, I never got round to taking the laptop into apple as they advised, and magically after a week or so it sorted itself out and has worked fine since.\n", "Q: How do I figure out if my iPhone is iCloud locked? I have an iPhone 6 that I purchased online. During initial setup I selected the language and country and also connected it to Wi-Fi. However, it's giving me the following error:\n\nYour iPhone could not be activated because the activation server\n  cannot be reached.\n\nDoes this mean it's iCloud locked? Or is it just that it needs a SIM card (I haven't put one in yet)?\n\nA: If you have a SIM card you should definitely install it and try again.\nHowever, considering your message is about the activation server being unreachable, I would also recommend checking Apple's System Status page. Once there, check in particular for the colour of the circle next to iOS Device Activation (usually listed in the 2nd column). If the circle isn't green, try activating your iPhone again later.\nIn terms of your concern/question about determining if it is iCloud locked, you will know this if you're being prompted to sign in with an Apple ID in order to activate it. If you are, then it has an activation lock.\nFor more information you can read Find My iPhone Activation Lock.\nFinally, for general support on activation issues you can refer to: If you can‘t activate your iPhone.\n", "Q: Can Automator pass multiple lines (e.g. from a shell script) to the New Mail Message action? I have Automator running a shell script that ends with cat \"tempfile.txt\". The cat command should output the contents of tempfile.txt. The file tempfile.txt contains just the following three paragraphs over five lines:\n\n1st paragraph Lorem\n2nd paragraph Lorem ipsum\n3rd paragraph Ut enim\n\nI have this chained in Automator to the \"New Mail Message\" action. The instructions for this action say that \"If text is received from a previous action, the text is appended to the message.\"\nThe expected behavior is therefore that the body of the email message contains those three paragraphs. Instead, it contains only the third—shown here:\n\nBelow is the relevant part of the workflow. In it we can see in the Results for the shell script that all three paragraphs are being passed to the \"New Mail Action.\" Why does this not put all of the input text file into the message body?\n\nUpdate (further info): If I swap in the \"Create New Outlook Mail Message\" action in place of the Mail.app action, all three paragraphs are successfully passed to the body of the new message in Outlook. However, they are passed without line breaks.\n\nA: It looks like there may be a bug in New Mail Message action in Automator. If you are interested in an AppleScript workaround, where the output of the Run Shell Script action is formed into the content of the new mail message using AppleScript code to create a new mail message, here's an example workaround.\nIn place of the New Mail Message action use a Run AppleScript action, after the Run Shell Script action, with the following example AppleScript code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set theMessageContent to \"\"\n    repeat with i from 1 to (count of input)\n        set theMessageContent to theMessageContent & item i of input & linefeed\n    end repeat\n    tell application \"Mail\"\n        activate\n        set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, content:theMessageContent}\n    end tell\nend run\n\nThis creates a new message that looks like the following example image.\n\nIf you need too, you can add additional properties, as in this example AppleScript code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set theMessageContent to \"\"\n    repeat with i from 1 to (count of input)\n        set theMessageContent to theMessageContent & item i of input & linefeed\n    end repeat\n    tell application \"Mail\"\n        activate\n        set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, subject:\"Hello World\", content:theMessageContent}\n        tell theMessage\n            make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {name:\"John Doe\", address:\"johndoe@domain.com\"}\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend run\n\nObviously, you'll need to change the value of the additional properties, and or add more properties then shown, to fit your needs. You can look in Mail's AppleScript Dictionary in Script Editor for additional applicable properties.\nThis creates a new message that looks like the following example image.\n\n", "Q: Does the late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro Support PCI-E SSDs? I'd like to upgrade my late 2013 retina Macbook Pro with a M.2 PCI-E SSD. Is this possible? Do I need an adapter?\n\nA: As you can see in the image below from ifixit, the 2013 Retina Macbook Pro does have a kind of M.2 PCI-E SSD. (It is the black rectangle the person is holding.)\n\nHowever Apple uses proprietary firmware on those SSDs, so only SPECIFICALLY Mac compatible drives will work such as these these and these.\nThis Ifixit guide shows you how to install a new drive, and links to a page that lets you purchase a compatible drive. \n", "Q: Is there a Mac keyboard shortcut to \"Select Current Line\"? I am looking for a keyboard shortcut that selects the full line (i.e., the text of the line) of the blinking caret cursor in any editable, multi-line text field. Nothing more than just this one line should be selected.\n\nI understand that one can use the following two keyboard shortcuts in succession to accomplish this:\nshift + ⬆ \nshift + ➡\nHowever, this does not work in all applications. That is, sometimes this combo highlights the current line plus the previous line, minus the first character of the previous line.\n\nA: To move the cursor to the start/end of the line, you can use ⌘← and ⌘→.\nTo select whilst moving the cursor, add ⇧. You need to move the cursor to one end of the line first using ⌘← or ⌘→, then hold ⇧ and use the opposite ⌘→ or ⌘←.\n\nA: To select an entire line of editable text, assuming a left justified language...\nIf the insertion point cursor is at the beginning of the line, press:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command–Shift–Right Arrow   ⌘⇧➡\n\n\nIf the insertion point cursor is at the end of the line, press:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command–Shift–Left Arrow    ⌘⇧⬅\n\n\nIf the insertion point cursor is at any other part of the line, press:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command–Left Arrow, Command–Shift–Right Arrow   ⌘⬅ ⌘⇧➡\nNote that in this previous key sequence set, that you can keep the ⌘ key pressed while pressing/releasing ⬅ then press ⇧➡ so as to eliminate pressing/releasing the ⌘ key twice.\nSee the Document shortcuts section in Mac keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: It depends what you mean by a \"line\". In TextEdit for example, long lines are automatically soft-wrapped inside the window.\nTo select the part of a long line where it's wrapped to a single row:\nHold shift + command, press left-arrow then right-arrow.\nTo select an entire line, between line breaks (aka a paragraph):\n\n*\n\n*If the cursor is at the end of the line:\n\n*\n\n*Optionally, to include the newline at the end of the line, press right-arrow.\n\n*Press shift + option + up-arrow.\n\n\n\n*Otherwise:\n\n*\n\n*If the cursor is in the middle of the line, press shift + option + up-arrow.\n\n*Press shift + option + down-arrow.\n\n*Optionally, press shift + option + down-arrow again to include the newline, if the following line is blank. If not (or even if so), release option and press right-arrow.\n\n\n\n\nA: From any position of current line:\nhold Shift+Command, hit→ then←, or hit← then →\n", "Q: Key combination not working when using the touch bar? In an IDE I use key combinations like Shiftshift ⎋ (Esc).\nI'm now using a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar. It seems this is not working anymore, as the IDE only reports Esc being pressed.\nHas anyone else experienced this? \nPS: I've heard about the workaround of mapping caps lock to Esc, but I'd like to use that as a last resort.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/message/31347902#31347902\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/message/31206769#31206769\n\nA: Try hitting fnshiftEsc, that triggers the Shift+Esc for me.

I'm pretty new to the whole Apple story, so i'm not sure if this is possible at all.\nThe story is that we have unsupervised corporate-owned iPhones at work. Now we are about to enroll an MDM (specific MobileIron) and the devices need to be in supervised mode.\nWhat we tried so far:\nBackup the iPhone (iTunes), supervise the device in Apple configurator 2, and push the backup back onto the iPhone. \nSomehow my Instructor managed to get it working: the iPhone was now supervised containing all user data.\nNew day, new iPhone, he did all the same steps again (iTunes and iCloud Backup), an reproductibly we couldn't get the backup back to supervised mode. We've tried it with 3 iPhones 5s and on one iPad mini 2, it was either wiped and supervised, or it was only the unsupervised user backup. \nI've been searching https://discussions.apple.com and other boards since last friday, no success so far. What i found were instructions for new, wiped devices, which didn't help.\nMy last hope is that you can help me solving this problem. \nIs it possible to supervise a device without wiping it and restoring or keeping the users data for it?\nThanks folks!\n\nA: According to this discussion thread, you can try the following method:\nWARNING: I have not tested this and you may lose data!\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Disable \"Find my iPad” on the old iOS device, perform iCloud backup on the same device\n  \n*Plug in the new device to Apple Configurator, Supervise and update the device to the latest iOS\n  \n*Once Supervised, unplug the new device and go through the Setup Assistant to restore from iCloud\n  \n*When the iCloud restore of the new device is complete, do not touch the Setup Assistant, plug it back into Configurator\n  \n*Before you refresh, change the \"Restore\" and \"Update iOS\" options to \"Do not Update/Restore\"\n  \n*Once refreshed, proceed through the Setup Assistant, your device should now be Supervised and ready for MDM Enrollment\n  \n\nNote that this is for cloning a device, I have not found a way to use the backup of the same device to supervise it.\nAlso, it does appear that you can try this with an iTunes backup as well if you'd like. Just follow the same steps and use iTunes instead of iCloud to get a more complete backup.\nIt looks, however, like some versions of Apple Configurator do and do not work, so your mileage may vary.\n\nA: I just asked the MDM people at WWDC 2018 and they gave me this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a backup of any form (iTunes un/encrypted, iCloud)\n\n*Restore the backup to the same device\n\n*While the device is at the setup assistant page (and Apple Configurator shows the little setup icon on the device), supervise it. The device should also have the \"supervisable\" trait on it in list view if you enable it.\n\n*Enjoy/apply profiles from Configurator with new elevated privileges. \n\n\nThey weren't really sure and it took around six engineers to reach consensus because they were all familiar with the process from slightly different phases. They also suggested that on that in some setup thing (codename 'buddy'?) on iOS 9/10 it would actually let you do it but they weren't sure anymore. \n", "Q: How to remove disabled Google account from Macbook? I had a work Google account. When I left my job, the account was disabled, but whenever I try to use my Google account for accessing something, it asks me to choose between my personal account, and this disabled account (which doesn't work, because it's disabled). I want to remove this account completely, so it doesn't keep suggesting I use it. \nBoth iPhone and Mac use iCloud so they could be sharing account setup information. my iPhone does not see the disabled account, but my MacBook still does. \nHow do I remove it from my MacBook so that I no longer have to choose between my current Google account and my old disabled account?\n\nA: One simple means would be to make a new user account on the Mac. \nYou can verify the undesired account isn't in the systems preferences and then start using the google services you wish. \nIf the accounts are still tied together, you know it's coming from google and the servers in the \"cloud\" and not your settings. \nIf everything is good on the new account, then start going app by app and removing saved passwords, saved accounts, cookies and session caches until you clear up all the automation you have accumulated for the old and now undesired account. \nApp by app might start with: Safari, Keychain, Chrome, System Preferences (accounts)\n", "Q: I cannot use 4k on my 4k Screen?

If not, you can download this directly from here.\nI would download/install the firmware update first to see if that resolves your problem. This eliminates the possibility that it's a firmware issue with the HooToo hub (otherwise you could spend hours troubleshooting other causes for absolutely no benefit).\nIf you still have problems after installing the update, please comment below to let me know.\n", "Q: 2013 iMac 27\" SSD Failure, Power Supply or Both? I have a late 2013 27\" iMac i7, 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD, running the laster version of Sierra 10.12.4 (I think) Two days ago I suddenly got the spinning beachball while browsing in Safari. However, after a few seconds it just froze completely - the first time ever! I had to hold down the power button to shut it down. I restarted and then a few hours later it happened again. I shut it down again but this time it would not start. Nothing happened when I pressed the power button. I tried a SMC reset and it started so I ran disk utility. There were a couple of minor permissions errors, which were fixed but then it froze again. After 2-3mins A black screen appeared saying there was a problem and the computer had to be shut down, which it did by itself.\nFrom that moment, it's gotten worse. Now it won't start properly at all. I press the power button and nothing happens, then maybe 3-4 mins later it starts and I get the flashing folder.\nI tried starting in safe mode, recovery mode and also from a Disk Warrior start-up USB drive but when I run disk utility I don't see the hard drive, only disk0 > OS X Base System.\nI thought it might just be the SSD but why would it be so difficult to power on from safe mode, recovery or the Disk Warrior USB drive? Do I have a power issue, an SSD issue or both?\nMany thanks\nAdditional Information: As requested, I tried to run tests holding down Option + \"D\". As before, it was very reluctant to power on at all. Pressing the power button did nothing. I pressed it a couple more times and then suddenly about 3mins later I got the startup bong. I immediately hit option+d and it started the diagnostics. I then got a black screen with the following message:\nThere may be an issue with a storage device. Ref Code: VDH002\n...followed by instructions to contact Apple.\nI also took it to an Apple service centre today and the engineer confirmed that the main hard drive was not appearing, so it does look like the SSD has failed, but why does it have so much trouble starting up? Why doesn't the power button work properly?\n\nA: Troubleshooting is often a process of elimination and requires time.\nConsidering all the steps you've already taken, the first thing I'd do next is to test your hardware with Apple Diagnostics.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n", "Q: Combine/merge two separate image files of the same thing(newspaper page) taken in half Is there a way of combining two photos of the same thing taken in half? \nFor example, i have two images of the same newspaper page taken in two halves in order to keep the focus and quality of the text to an acceptable level. Now, how do i merge these two photos into one seamless photo? \n\nA: There are a number of applications which will stitch images together, provided there is sufficient overlap. Calico is one I have used. Partly this depends on how the images are taken.\nFor simple tasks like this a manual process is probably better.\nI use GIMP, importing the images into 2 layers and manually moving them until the match is \"adequate\".\n", "Q: Is Apple Care+ worldwide? I am planning to purchase an iPhone 6s (unlocked) from the US and use it in India. Since Apple does not provide international warranty for phones rather than the iMac etc, I came across Apple Care+ (That covers warranty for 2 years of hardware & software issues). So, I am planning to get Apple Care+ along with the purchase of the phone.\nIf issues arise with the iPhone, will it be covered by Apple Care in India?\n\nA: Apple offers two AppleCare plans:\n\n\n*\n\n*AppleCare Protection Plan\n\n*AppleCare+\n\n\nBoth of these are actually AppleCare products.\nAccording to Apple:\n\nAppleCare products for Apple Watch, for Mac, for iPod, for Apple TV,\n  and for Apple Display provide global repair coverage. Service will be\n  limited to the options available in the country or region where\n  service is requested. Service options, parts availability, and\n  response time vary by country or region.\nAll repairs will be completed using genuine Apple parts for repair\n  service. All repairs are performed by Apple-authorized technicians.\n\nSource: Apple\nTherefore, only Apple Watch, Mac, iPod, Apple TV, and Apple Displays are covered by a global repair warranty (as you already state in your question). However, you're mistaken in assuming AppleCare+ is treated differently to the AppleCare Protection Plan, because they both fall under the category of AppleCare products, and the above quote applies to both.\nIn other words, while you can purchase AppleCare+ for an iPhone, this coverage will not be global. In your case, purchasing an iPhone in the US and also purchasing AppleCare+ will only cover you in the US. It will not cover you in India or anywhere outside the US.\nIn a nutshell, while AppleCare+ provides additional hardware and technical support from Apple (it even covers two incidents of accidental damage), it is not currently available in India, nor does it provide global coverage for iPhones.\nHowever, Apple has reached a number of agreements with the government of India and is now investing a lot of time and money there. It is possible that at some future point AppleCare+ will be available in India. With this in mind it is always worth checking with Apple directly at the time of purchase.\n", "Q: GPU Panic cpp 143 macOS Sierra 10.12.5 stability issues and spontaneous restarts I have no idea what is going on.

Unfortunately, coverage for this has now ended.\nHowever, there are a few things you can do to minimise the problem.\ngfxCardStatus\nMany users have found that using gfxCardStatus will reduce these issues most of the time. My experience with many users is that versions 1.8.1 and 2.1 seem to be the best for your particular model MBP, even though more recent versions fixed a number of bugs.\nSo, I’d like you to give version 1.8.1 a go for a while and see how you go. If you’re not happy with that, then try version 2.1 instead.\nNOTE: Unfortunately, there were two distinct issues that affected your particular model of MBP. gfxCardStatus was designed to address a hardware problem that occurs on a number of models, including yours. However, your model was also prone to being affected by a software issue that was unique to your model. If your model is affected by that as well, then version 2.3 may be a better choice.  So, in summary, I would start with 1.8.1 and see how you go. If you’re not happy, then try 2.1. Then go to 2.3 if you're still not satisfied. Do not try any other versions for your model MBP!\nGoogle Chrome\nIf you use Google Chrome I would strongly consider not doing so. However, if you need to, there’s actually a setting in Google Chrome that may help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Chrome > Preferences\n\n*Scroll down to the bottom\n\n*Click on Show advanced settings…\n\n*Scroll down to the System heading\n\n*Uncheck the Use hardware acceleration when available option\n\n\nAdobe Photoshop\nIf you use Adobe Photoshop, you may be able to tinker with Photoshop’s settings as well. Depending on the version you use, if you go to Photoshop’s Preferences and look under the Performance category, there should be a section for GPU Settings. By going into its Advanced Settings you may be able to try different options for the mode of use. It will probably default to Normal, but you could change it to Basic and see whether Photoshop plays more nicely with your MBP. Under GPU settings you could also switch off OpenGL Drawing altogether, but that may limit some functionality.\nMac OS El Capitan\nThere are a couple of things you can do within El Capitan:\n\n\n*\n\n*You’re probably already aware of this one – but for your MBP you should have an additional setting under System Preferences > Energy Saver for Automatic graphics switching. Playing with this and the other Graphics option (for better battery life) may be useful.\n\n*Now this one is not so obvious:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Click on Accessibility\n\n*Select Display (in the left-hand column)\n\n*Tick the Reduce transparency box (on the right-hand side)\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\n\nBasically, to draw/display transparency in the GUI (windows etc) it needs a lot of graphics power. Not a good idea for your MBP I’m afraid.\n\nA: I have the same model with the same issues. \nI've come across what aims to be a permanent fix instead of the gfxCardStatus work arounds. \nThe work arounds themselves seem to work ok for the average user, where most people suggest to install gfxCardStatus, and then use \"Integrated Only\" option, so that it can't actually switch back and forth from the 'discrete' Nvidia GT 330M graphics card, (which is causing the kernel panics and graphics glitches). This works well for those that can handle the basic ~220mb graphics, and that don't need to connect to an external monitor (as the better graphics card Nvidia GT 330M, is what controls the external monitors). \nHowever, I'm one of the people that needs the most from the graphics card and needs to connect to an external monitor occasionally. So.. I've come across the solution from Louis Rossmann and associates.. \nFor yours/mine's particular MBP models' issue (in the mid 2010 15\" MBP), the motherboard repair guru Louis Rossmann and associates have discovered that the problem with this exact model only is that there's a $2.50 capacitor that goes faulty, and causes random power shortages to the graphics card. Which is actually what is causing the issues, not the graphics card itself!\nI have the same MBP 2010 15\" model, and have just ordered the replacement capacitors myself. From what I've read, almost everyone who does this mod completely fixes the issues with the graphics card kernel panics and other issues with the screen glitches etc, and when it switches to the 'discrete' graphics card (Nvidia GT 330M).\nHere's the link to his youtube video on replacing the capacitor on the motherboard..\nShould you trust an Apple Genius when they tell you it's a graphics processor? \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzcgT_fiVTA&feature=youtu.be \nThere's also forum posts on the subject, which state which exact capacitors to buy. Of the 3 choices, people were having some issues with the 'ceramic' smaller capacitors, but pretty much 100% success with the 'aluminium' ones.\nThe aluminium one most people are using with great success is the: \"Panasonic EEF-CX0D331R\". \nThis is the Canadian link I was given, to the exact aluminium one I bought (but I bought from an Australian supplier, stock coming from UK):\nhttps://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/panasonic-electronic-components/EEF-CX0 D331R/PCE4275CT-ND/816445\nHope that helps some of you. This is MacBook Pro 2010 15\" only. \n(exact same capacitor issues but in a different location on 2008-9 MBP).\nPS: I still think there is 'something' different about Mac OSX Sierra, as I hadn't had these problems for a VERY long time, and now they're back every day, worse than ever, since installing Mac OSX Sierra. Seems to have popped up with MANY other people since upgrading to Sierra. \n", "Q: Apple Store Diagnostics say my hard drive failed but my computer works fine - Should I replace it? I had my MacBook Pro 17\", late 2011, in for a replacement of the motherboard. The technician in the Apple Store told me that their diagnostics said that not only my mainboard had failed, but also both my hard drives (SSD and HDD in SuperDrive slot). I asked them to NOT replace the hard drives. When I got the laptop back, I can boot up normally and all my data is still there and accessible. Should I nonetheless replace my hard drive? Is there any possible damage the hard drives could have that I can't see, despite them working from what I can see?\nThank you!\n\nA: First and foremost make sure you have a backup regime in place (e.g. using Time Machine).\nAlso, ensure you're backing up both the SSD and HDD. \nMy answers to your questions below assume you do have backups in place!\n\nShould I nonetheless replace my hard drive?\n\nYou're asking for an opinion here, so you risk getting different answers. However, if it was me I'd test both the hard drive and SSD with something better than Disk Utility (but that's easy for me to do as I own a whole range of diagnostic packages). In fact I'd test both of them at least twice, using different software.\nThen, assuming all was okay, I'd likely replace the HDD with a fusion/hybrid drive and put the existing HDD in an external enclosure.\n\nIs there any possible damage the hard drives could have that I can't\n  see, despite them working from what I can see?\n\nYes.\n", "Q: iPad and iPhone show one delivered iMessage but not on the other. Is message delivered? Sent message from iPad or iPhone and message does not say delivered. But when I look at other device it shows delivered. Is message delivered? Example message sent from iPhone no delivered status. Look at same message on IPad and shows delivered status. \n\nA: I've experienced this when the sending device was the iPhone, and I knew the recipient was on holiday and not online - the iPhone did not show delivered, but the iPad did. Eventually, when the recipient came back online days later, the iMessage showed delivered on the iPhone too.\nThis is a likely an iMessage bug/anomaly (which I wish Apple would address!) I would take the true delivery notification to be the device from where the message was originally sent.\n\nA: Give it sometime. Your iMessage delivered. It usually has to do w iCloud synchronization. \n", "Q: How can I answer to a call with Airpods I bought a pair of Airpods for my iPhone 7. When I have them connected I can't answer calls, but I have to disconnect them to be able to answer. How can I fix the problem?\n\nA: Siri can notice when someone is calling you. You can answer the call tapping twice your Airpods. Then, you can tap them twice again to close the call.\nIf tapping twice doesn't work, go on Settings > Siri and verify \"Access when locked\" is activated.\n\nA: I had the same problem and I had to go to settings>general>reset>reset network setting and it worked fine after that\n", "Q: Safari, open in another panel When I open a link on Safari, it opens another tab overlapping the original, so to go back to the previous I have to browse all the other tabs. This is uncomfortable because in case I want to read the new link later, I have to make that passage. Is there an option to change card management?\n\nA: You should do so:\nSettings -> safaris -> open links -> in the background\n", "Q: Installing a SSD, should I or should I not disconnect the battery (MacBook Pro)? I'm about to switch my hard drive for an SSD. I checked for instructions online and found tutorials that instruct to disconnect the battery as a first step but I also found some forum posts from people saying it fried their logic board. \nA person also said a genius said disconnecting the battery could fry a logic board. \nThe mac I want to install the SSD into is a MacBook Pro 13\" late 2011. \nShould I disconnect the battery ?\nThanks !\n\nA: You don't need to disconnect the battery, but it's a good idea.\nThe only reason you disconnect they battery is to ensure that there is no power on any of the circuits which could inadvertently be shorted.\nIf people fry their logic board while disconnecting the battery, it's most likely they used a metallic tool (like a screw driver) to pry up the battery connector; use a plastic spudger tool.\n\n", "Q: MBP 13\" 2016 fast power discharge, no apps using significant battery I have a relatively new MBP 13\" 2016 which used to use discharge at 5 - 10 watts without any intensive apps. Today, while unplugged, I noticed my battery discharging at 15 - 20 watts despite closing every app, turning off wifi, and disabling time machine, reducing brightness to medium.\nIs there any better way to see what's using energy so consistently? I've tried Activity Monitor and looking at energy impact, but closing every relevant app which spikes energy usage seems to have no affect\nAny ideas what could cause it, or how I could fix?\nBelow are some results from my activity monitor\n\n\nA: From the results of your activity monitor screenshots, it is clear that the bash (shell) program ITerm2 is what is killing your battery. We can see this from the average energy impact of 66.25 and the CPU usage of 67%. This means the program is using over 25% of your Mac's CPU (2x CPUs = 200% total).\nIf you did not start this program, you should (force) quit it. The fact that it has been running over 1 day (25:42:52 CPU Time), and the fact that the problem just showed up today indicates that it is the source of the drain. Perhaps something has gone wrong and it is stuck in a loop.  \n", "Q: Backing up with rsync, how not to get into trouble with permissions and privileges? I am backing up files to an external hard drive using rsync as a test, usually I just copy pasted but I read that rsync is more reliable and does a checksum to verify the copy so I am trying it out now.\nI'm just using it as: rsync -a --progress [SOURCE] [DESTINATION]\nI noticed in the manual page relating to rsync that it also copies the permissions and privileges, in fact after the copy when I right click and \"get info\" on the files and folders, they have the same \"Sharing and Permissions\".\nWhen I check files backed up during previous backup processes (using copy/paste), sometimes the permissions are \"read & write\" for the current user (me) and \"no access\" for everyone else, some have \"read only\" for everyone and spotlight.\nMy question is: how can I be sure that the backed up files and folders will at least be readable by future users on my external hard drive. In other words, when I'll access the hard drive using a fresh clean install of my OS using a new/fresh/possibly-new-with-a-different-user-name-account, how can I be sure that I won't be locked out of my files by permissions etc ? I would like to at least get read only. \nDo I have to manually right click every file and folder then \"get info\"  and go to \"Sharing and Permissions\" and then choosing \"Read & Write\" for everyone ?\nThanks !\n\nA: *\n\n*You can always access the files by being an admin on the computer you attached the external drive to and changing them. The admin super-user can always fix permissions issues.\n\n*You can change permissions at the top level by clicking \"Apply to Enclosed Items\" That will change everything in the folder and below.\n\n\n\n\nA: External hard drives typically mount with the option noowners. The entire volume is set to ignore permission. The Get Info window will show that you are the owner and the group will show as your primary group (usually staff).\n", "Q: Which SATA cable do I need for a SSD installation in an iMac mid-2011? 1) which  SATA cable speed do I need for a SSD installment in a iMac mid-2011? In OWC or iFixit kits, they uses SATA 3, but today I can get quicker SATA 6 cables, does that work or make it quicker?\n2) do I need a data power splitter or just without splitter? I don't know where I need the power from.\nThanks\n\nA: By SATA 6, I assume you mean SATA 6Gb/s. This is now known as SATA 3. (In fact SATA 3Gb/s, is now known as SATA 2.)  SATA 3 has been around since 2009, and is backwards compatible with SATA 2, so a SATA 3 cable is fine. Also SSDs need both a power AND a data cable to function.\nApparently it is possible to add a second hard drive to this model of Mac (behind the CD drive). You do not state in the question if you merely wish to replace the hard drive you already have or add a second one. This Ifixit guide shows how to add a second drive. From the guide it is clear that this is a MAJOR undertaking. \nIf you simply wish to replace the drive you already have, as seen here, then you should have an easier time. However, according to the Ifixit guide (step 7)\n\nThe WD Caviar Blue drive is a non-standard SATA drive. The power connector features 7 pins, rather than the standard 4. The drive also has non-standard firmware. This means you can only use Apple's own hard drives and not any standard after-market SATA drive.\n\nThus you need to choose a compatible new drive. In this case you can just reuse the cables from the old drive. \n\nA: The sata cable you are looking for is called:\nSlimline SATA cable SATA 22 pin to 13 pin Cable SATA Female to Female\nYou can buy it here (it was the cheapest option I could find):\nhttps://www.aliexpress.com/item/25cm-Slimline-SATA-cable-SATA-22-pin-to-13-pin-Cable-SATA-Female-to-Female-converter/32830204299.html?spm=a2g0s.13010208.99999999.267.65f33c00IorXXe\nYou need to plug it into the sata port behind your logic board and then connect it to the SSD, which you can mount behind the Optical Drive.\nTheres a tutorial on how to do that here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIULGZHw8xI\n\nA: If you want to replace the optical drive with an SSD just as i did in my 2011 iMac, just buy a \"SATA 2nd HDD SSD Hard Drive Caddy for 12.7mm Universal CD / DVD-ROM\", put the SSD in and replace the optical drive using its cables. The only thing you have to move is the temperature sensor. Done it in 10 minutes with cleaning. The cable supports the maximum speed your SATA port does, so there's no point in replacing it. Everything else is a lot more complicated. If you need an optical drive, just mount it in an external USB housing and connect it to your USB port.\n", "Q: AppleScript progress bar bug: How to prevent progress dialog from lingering? The bug:\nWhen AppleScript's progress dialog is succeeded by a dialog, the progress dialog still lingers—even though all progress steps have completed, and the progress bar is full. It will linger until the script has been cancelled, until the script has completed, or until no additional dialogs exist in the script.\nThis bug cannot be witnessed while running the code from within Script Editor.app, because, in Script Editor, a progress dialog will not appear. Instead, a pie-shaped progress meter is integrated into the bottom of the script window.\n\nHow to reproduce the bug:\nSave the following AppleScript code as an .app file:\n(The file must be an .app file, as .scpt files cannot display progress dialogs.)\nset n to 5\n\nset progress total steps to n\nset progress description to \"Script Progress\"\nset progress additional description to \"Additional description\"\n\nrepeat with i from 1 to n\n    delay 0.1\n    set progress completed steps to i\nend repeat\n\ndisplay dialog \"The progress dialog should be gone at this point.\"\n\nUpon launching the application, you will see the following:\n\n\nThe question:\nDoes a workaround exist to force the progress dialog to close once its complete, so that additional dialogs can be placed after the progress dialog, without having the progress dialog still visible?\n\nWhat I've tried:\nI tried approaching the problem by interpreting the progress dialog simply as a \"window\" of the app.\nIf you run the following code in a separate AppleScript file, while both dialogs of ProgressBarTest.app are on screen (as in the above screenshot):\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set allWindows to name of window of processes whose visible is true\nend tell \n\nreturn allWindows\n\nyou will learn that ProgressBarTest.app has 2 open \"windows\". The titles of these windows are:\n{\"\", \"ProgressBarTest.app\"}\n\nThe first window in this list refers to the display dialog dialog. The second window in this list, entitled ProgressBarTest.app, is the progress dialog.\nI then attempted to close this progress dialog \"window\" by using AppleScript (like one may do for any standard application window). But, the following code:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"ProgressBarTest.app\"\n    if exists window \"ProgressBarTest.app\" then\n        close window \"ProgressBarTest.app\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\nwill give the user an error. The text of this error dialog is:\n\nScript Error\nSystem Events got an error: window \"ProgressBarTest.app\" of process \"ProgressBarTest.app\" doesn’t understand the “close” message.\n\nI shortly realized that, if your screen is the same point of view as that of the above screenshot, then you cannot even manually close out of the progress dialog. This is because the display dialog dialog takes precedence over the progress dialog; the display dialog dialog \"grays out\" (i.e., disables) all of the buttons in the progress dialog.\nSo, to account for this, in the ProgressBarTest.app code, I added a delay 5 directly above the display dialog \"The progress dialog should be gone at this point.\" line. I wanted to see if I could successfully close the progress dialog, if the progress dialog was the only active dialog of the application.\nI tried the following code:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"ProgressBarTest.app\"\n    if exists window \"ProgressBarTest.app\" then\n        click button 1 of window \"ProgressBarTest.app\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\nIn the above code, button 1 refers to the Stop button that is found in the progress dialog. (You can alternatively use button -4 or button 0 to refer to this same button.)\nThe good news is that this code successfully closed out of the progress dialog!\nThe bad news, however, is that when the progress dialog's Stop button is pressed, instead of only the progress dialog being closed, the entire script is cancelled. This is obviously undesirable.\nThe root of the issue is that the progress dialog contains no red \"x\"; the left-most circular button in the top bar of this dialog is always grayed-out. In other words, there is no way to close the progress dialog manually, without also prematurely ending the script. \nSo, this problem is more difficult to solve than I thought.\nIt appears that my desired outcome is impossible to achieve.\n\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \n\n\nA: Works for me on latest version of macOS Big Sur\nUPDATE\nBEST SOLUTION\nIf you place the display dialog command within a System Events tell block then  wrap the ignoring application responses command around that display dialog command, the progress indicator will complete it’s task without waiting for the display dialog window to be dismissed.\nThe ignoring application responses command will only work if it is placed within an application’s tell block\nset n to 50\n\nset progress total steps to n\nset progress description to \"Script Progress\"\nset progress additional description to \"Additional description\"\n\nrepeat with i from 1 to n\n    delay 0.1\n    set progress completed steps to i\nend repeat\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    activate\n    ignoring application responses\n        display dialog \"The progress dialog should be gone at this point.\"\n    end ignoring\nend tell\n\n\n\n\nOLD SOLUTION 1\nset n to 5\n\nset progress total steps to n\nset progress description to \"Script Progress\"\nset progress additional description to \"Additional description\"\n\nrepeat with i from 1 to n\n    delay 0.1\n    set progress completed steps to i\nend repeat\nreturn\nquit\n\non quit\n    activate\n    display dialog \"The progress dialog should be gone at this point.\"\n    continue quit -- allows the script to quit\nend quit\n\nHere is a way to run some repeat loops before the script quits\nset n to 5\n\nset progress total steps to n\nset progress description to \"Script Progress\"\nset progress additional description to \"Additional description\"\n\nrepeat with i from 1 to n\n    delay 0.1\n    set progress completed steps to i\nend repeat\nreturn\nquit\n\non quit\n    activate\n    display dialog \"The progress dialog should be gone at this point.\"\n    repeat 5 times\n        my get_my_IP()\n        my screenCaptureToDesktop()\n        delay 1\n    end repeat\n    continue quit -- allows the script to quit\nend quit\n\n\non get_my_IP()\n    activate\n    tell current application to display dialog (do shell script \"curl ifconfig.co\") with icon 2 buttons \"OK\" default button 1 with title \"Your Current IP Address Is..\" giving up after 5 -- \"curl ifconfig.io\"    -- alternate\nend get_my_IP\n\non screenCaptureToDesktop()\n    do shell script \"/usr/sbin/screencapture \\\"\" & ¬\n        POSIX path of (path to desktop as string) & ¬\n        \"Screen Shot \" & (current date) & \".png\\\"\"\nend screenCaptureToDesktop\n\n\nOLD SOLUTION 2\nWorking on one of my own projects, I had one of those \"EUREKA!\" moments.  Here is a completely different approach than my code in SOLUTION 1.  The approach here was to wrap most of my code in script objects or handlers, then call those objects as needed.  In this solution, I saved this script as a stay open application, with explicit run and idle handlers.

I want to open them with the \"PDF reader\" App instead.  How do I do this?\n\nA: Another method, simpler, not involving clouds is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Touch and hold on book's icon in iBooks, and, from pop-up menu\nchoose \"Print\", see figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n*On the preview page, do inverse pinch (two fingers spread):\n\n\n*Now, from Printer options, lower left corner, touch the square to\nsend to other applications:\n\n\n*And choose where to send a copy - in this example I used Documents\napplication\n\n\nA: Solution for MacOS (the question originally didn't specify OS)\nTo do this, just open the folder which contains your iBooks, right click on a particular book, go to \"open with\", and choose the program you want (say pdf reader). \nThis post describes where the iBooks folder is located in Sierra. \nIt should look something like this: \n\n\nEdit:\nThe OP has now specified that the problem is specific to  iOS. Doing this directly is impossible due to the way that the iOS manages storage. iOS doesn't have a file system in the way that macOS does. Each file is associated with the operating  system or a particular app. According to this website for iOS developers\n\nFor security purposes, an iOS app’s interactions with the file system are limited to the directories inside the app’s sandbox directory\n\nThis means app A can't just go into app B's storage and read a file (say a PDF document).\nThus, you need a workaround. Personally, I use google drive to sync my books (wirelessly) between my mac and my iPhone/tablets. While you could probably do something like this with iCloud I haven't tried that yet so I'll give my solution. All you have to do is\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign up for a google account if you don't have one already\n\n*Download the Google Drive macOS app\n\n*Make a folder  F of all your books (iBooks already did this (see my unedited answer)). Then you have 2 choices:\n\n*Choice 1 (ADVANCED): \"Hard link\" folder F to your Google Drive folder. This will update your google drive automatically every time F is edited, say every time you add a new book to F. The way to do this is discussed in this question. You will need knowledge of the command line. \n\n*Choice 2 (SIMPLE): Manually copy F into your google drive folder. (Note that you can also drag F into the google drive folder. HOWEVER if you do this once F is uploaded, F will be stored in the (google drive) cloud, and no longer on your computer.)\n\n*Download the google drive app on your phone (or tablet or android) and sign in.\n\n*You can now see the folder F on your iphone and any other ios (or Android!!!!!) devices on which you have installed the app. \n\n*If you have a wifi connection, you can just click on a PDF to open it. If you want to make it so that in the future you can open PDFs without a wifi connection, just follow these instructions.\n\n\nHere's a screenshot of how it should look.  \n", "Q: Cannot open or update iPhoto I bought a used Macbook Pro running macOS Sierra.\nIt came after the previous owners reset it and installed the iLife pack (iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand). I couldn't use those apps since it came with Mac OS X 10.9, and those apps versions were to low to use on macOS Sierra.\nI had a problem updating GarageBand and iMovie, but I managed to do that after uninstalling those and re-installing them from the Mac App Store. The problem is with iPhoto. I can't open it or uninstall it. I only see this in the Launchpad:\n\nWhen I click it I get a message saying that I need to update it, but I can't because according to the Mac App Store, it is not available on my local App Store.\nWhat can I do in order to install it?\n\nA: As you know, since the previous owners installed a version of the iLife pack you couldn't run on macOS Sierra, you've had to update the individual apps to their current versions. \nWhere you've fallen down a little, is that while you could install current versions of GarageBand and iMovie, there is no current version of iPhoto as it was superseded by the launch of the Photos app. More specifically, iPhoto was discontinued in April 2015 and has not appeared on the Mac App Store since. \nInstead, what you need to do is use the Photos app. This should be on your MacBook Pro as it would've been installed as part of macOS Sierra. By default it should be on your Dock, but if it isn't you should be able to find it within your Applications folder.\nIf you have an old iPhoto library, Photos can convert it to a Photos photo library.\nFor more information, refer to Photos Help. \n\nA: *\n\n*Try opening it inside the /Applications/ folder\n\n*Downgrade from macOS Sierra to an older version of OS X\n\n*Open it via the Terminal. Type this line in the terminal and hit enter: /Applications/iPhoto.app/Contents/MacOS/iPhoto &\n\nCaution: It is not recommend to use both versions and the same time.\n  There is no reason not to use Photos starting with macOS High Sierra\n  later this year.\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Hard Reset? ...

I then pasted my custom icon into this Resources folder, and renamed my icon applet.icns.\nThe effect of this was a custom icon in informational dialogs in my AppleScript application, but it did not actually change the actual application icon (i.e., the icon that is inserted into the Dock while the application is running).

Could it work to delete the app, and create a new one to get a new reviewer?\n\nA: I would probably rip out all the logos and see if your app is viable without the copyright issues involved with third party logos - especially ones in your marketing material. \nBarring that, let's assume you can and do get clearance to use the logos of the companies and then resubmit, I'm thinking you're going to have a long road to approval even if you get past using / selling / profiting by / advertising against other people's logos.\nIf you look at the summary guidelines, your next likely risks of being rejected summarily for \"hundreds of other apps\" in the same category. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/rejections/\nAlso the \"lasting value\" qualifier would likely be a hurdle for you to pass - especially if your app functionality could be easily done as a web app (take or leave that last one if it applies to you - I have no way to know if your logo quiz uses unique iOS API but the broad category seems better done as web apps).\nThere is also discussion on these two posts about \"but officer, other people were speeding\" and how to appeal a metadata rejection:\n\n\n*\n\n*App was rejected for use of protected 3rd party material\n\n*How to react on Appstore rejection of screenshots?\n", "Q: Get first item in list using AppleScript How do I get the first item from a list into a variable?\nI'm trying to get the first window of an application's windows.\nI tried\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with theProcess in processes\n        if not background only of theProcess then\n            if processName is \"Xcode\" then\n                set theWindow to first window of windows\n            end if\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nbut it throws this error:\n\nCan't get window of every window.\n\n\nA: Unless you have an explicit need for going about it in the manner shown in your question, I'd keep it much more simple and use:\ntell application \"System Events\" to set isRunning to exists (processes where name is \"Xcode\")\nif isRunning then set theWindow to (first window of application \"Xcode\")\n\nOtherwise, modifying your existing code block in the following manner will get that same result as the two lines of code above:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with theProcess in processes\n        if not background only of theProcess then\n            if name of theProcess is \"Xcode\" then\n                tell application \"Xcode\"\n                    set theWindow to first window of application \"Xcode\"\n                end tell\n            end if\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nIf you want to use the first two line of code in my answer in a more tokenized manned, as an example, use:\nset appName to \"Xcode\"\ntell application \"System Events\" to set isRunning to exists (processes where name is appName)\nif isRunning then set theWindow to (first window of application appName)\n\nThen all you need to do is set appName to the target app in the first line of code and the two lines of code following it stand as is and do not need to be edited for use with other app names.\n\nA: Instead of first window of windows try item 1 of windows\nAs pointed out by others, your code may have additional issues to work through but using the syntax suggested in this answer can be used to overcome the issue of retrieving the first object in a list of objects.\n", "Q: Saving my all iMessage conversations to Windows 10 I need to save my iMessage conversations as they are, because I'm afraid all the updated dialogue will be erased as soon a I restore my iPod from a previous backup.

However, up until last Friday, it spent most of its time in a box as I had no use for it. Now though I need to do serious development work using it, and decided as it's been such a long time since it had an update, I'd throw all the updates it was missing at it. This led me to installed Sierra on to it.\nI can't tell you how much I regret that decision so far, for the fact that connecting over WiFi to my home network is slow. And I mean painfully slow, as it quite often quotes speeds of 10Kb/s when downloading various bits and pieces from the internet. Opening Google search pages often results in about a wait of 30 seconds, followed by an even longer wait to open the page I need. YouTube videos are also painfully bad to watch, pixelated as it attempts to furnish my Mac with the video as quickly as it can at the expense of quality.\nNow my Mac Mini is situated downstairs in my dining room, my Billion router sits in the living room. In line of sight terms, it's about 5m to 10m with two single cinder block walls between it. Initially I thought my WiFi was playing up, however my ThinkPad running Debian 8 flies with the WiFi. I get much faster download speeds, YouTube videos load in an appropriate manner, general web browsing takes seconds rather than minutes. My iPad Air 2 (think that's what they're called?) is slightly slower than the ThinkPad but much, much quicker than the Mac Mini. All of these were tested in the same location as the Mac Mini. So I can safely rule out issues with the WiFi.\nSo in my opinion - but I'm happy to be proved wrong! - the problem must lie with the Sierra update? I've seen numerous blog posts relating to slow WiFi with Sierra, and I have followed the steps they've outlined. Deleting preferences etc, restarting etc. But these haven't made a single bit of difference to the speed I'm getting with the Mac.\nSo I would like to know what other options I have available to me to speed this up? I can't actually use it for the development work I need to do if the WiFi is so poor. I'm not adverse to nuking the Mac and starting again, but obviously I want to advoid this as best I can.\nEDIT: Following from the advice yesterday, I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed the networking plist files (again)\n\n*Reset the SMC \n\n*Reset the PRAM/NVRAM\n\n*Followed the steps in the Mac OS X Daily link in the comments\n\n\nThe problem still persists. I didn't have chance to fiddle with my WiFi, although I'll be honest I'm quite annoyed that's even a suggestion by Apple as this Mac worked fine before Sierra got near it. And when I see other devices use that network without problem, well I don't know.\nFurther more, the hard wired suggestion - yes would fix it but it's not a remedy to provide internet/networking speeds I should be getting on my Mac, but it isn't fix a problem with poor WiFi on that machine.\n\nA: Apple has a post about reccomended wifi settings for your router, as they do not believe that it is their software being glitchy, but the interference between bands (I've had the issue as well. See https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202068 or see below)\n\n\n2.4 GHz channel width\n\nChannel width controls how large of a ”pipe” is available to transfer data. However, larger channels are more subject to interference and more likely to interfere with other devices. A 40 MHz channel is sometimes called a wide channel, and a 20 MHz channel is a narrow channel.\n\nSet to: 20 MHz\n\nUse 20 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Using 40 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band can cause performance and reliability issues with your network, especially in the presence of other Wi-Fi networks and other 2.4 GHz devices. A 40 MHz channel might also cause interference and issues with other devices that use this band, such as Bluetooth devices, cordless phones, and neighboring Wi-Fi networks. Routers that don't support 40 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band do support 20 MHz channels.\n\n5 GHz channel width\n\nChannel width controls how large of a \"pipe\" is available to transfer data. Larger channels are more susceptible to interference, and more likely to interfere with other devices. Interference is less of an issue in the 5 GHz band than in the 2.4 GHz band. A 40 MHz channel is sometimes called a wide channel, and a 20 MHz channel is a narrow channel.\n\nSet to:\n      For 802.11n access points, set the 5GHz band to 20 MHz and 40 MHz.\n      For 802.11ac access points, set the 5GHz band to 20 MHz, 40 MHz, and 80 MHz.\n\nFor best performance and reliability, enable support for all channel widths. This allows devices to use the largest width they support, which results in optimal performance and compatibility. Not all client devices support 40 MHz channels, so don't enable 40 MHz-only mode. Devices that support only 20 MHz channels cant connect to a Wi-Fi router in 40 MHz-only mode. Similarly, don't enable 80 MHz-only mode, or only clients capable of 802.11ac will be able to connect. Routers that don't support 40 MHz or 80 MHz channels do support 20 MHz channels.\n\nWMM\n\nWMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia) prioritizes network traffic according to four access categories: voice, video, best effort, and background.\n\nSet to: Enabled\n\nAll 802.11n and 802.11ac access points should have WMM enabled in their default configuration. Disabling WMM can cause issues for the entire network, not just Apple products on the network.\n\nMAC address authentication or filtering\n\nRestricts access to a Wi-Fi router to devices with specific MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.\n\nSet to: Disabled\n\nWhen enabled, this feature allows a user to configure a list of MAC addresses for the Wi-Fi router, and restrict access to devices with addresses that are on the list. Devices with MAC addresses not on the list will fail to associate with the Wi-Fi network. MAC addresses can be changed easily, so don't rely on them to prevent unauthorized access to the network.\n    iOS 8 and later uses a randomized MAC address when running Wi-Fi scans. The scans are conducted when a device isn't associated with a Wi-Fi network and its processor is asleep. A device’s processor goes to sleep shortly after the screen is turned off. Wi-Fi scans are run to determine if a user can connect to a preferred Wi-Fi network. Enhanced Wi-Fi scans are run when a device uses Location Services for apps that use geofencing, such as location-based reminders, that determine if the device is near a specific location.\n\n\n\nA: Avoid Apple's WiFi Altogether.\nIf you are going to use your Mac mini for Dev work, I (IMO) would put this on a wired connection rather than WiFi.  Since the issue isn't your WiFi per se, as evidenced by the fact all your other devices work just fine;  it's just Apple's implementation of it that is causing these issues (and yes, I agree, it should work as you expect it to).  \nThe best course of action would be to avoid Apple's WiFi altogether and use Ethernet (notice the emphasis).  It's proven, it's reliable, and it's much faster.\nThe most common and reliable way is to just run a CAT5e/6 network run between your two locations.  But this may be impossible or prohibitive for any number of reasons.  So we have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Powerline Ethernet\n\n*Bridged Routers\n\n\nPowerLine Ethernet1is a technology that embeds TCP/IP traffic in the electrical signal of a home's electrical wires.  The tech has actually been around since the 1970's.  They are very inexpensive and quite reliable.  \nI used a Netgear PowerLINE 1200 in a client's home in Puerto Rico where the whole house is reinforced concrete and WiFi couldn't go from upstairs to downstairs.  It allowed me to add a switch and a WAP to add a server, and downstairs WiFi coverage.\n\nBridged Routers or WiFi Extenders is your second option.  WiFi extenders can be purchased that will not only extend your WiFi coverage, but also give you Ethernet connectivity as well (make sure they have an ethernet port like the picture below).\nSince your WiFi is good, this will allow you to use your good WiFi signal and bridge it to the more reliable Ethernet on your Mac mini. \n\n\nYou don't even have to purchase this if you have a cheap router laying around that supports DDWRT2.  \n\n\n1 How Do PowerLine Adapters Work\n2 DDWRT Wireless Bridge\n", "Q: How to natively enable TRIM in Sierra for a 3rd-party SSD? My question is: How to natively enable TRIM in Sierra for a 3rd-party SSD?\nA solution I found involves installing an \"out of the App Store\" app that will probably ask for admin credentials etc which I generally don't like. \nIs there a native way in OS Sierra to enable TRIM ?

My Mac and my old iPhone 6 used to work with personal hotspot just fine.\nI replaced my old iPhone 6 with an iPhone 7 and transferred all my apps and data from the 6 to the 7.  Most things worked fine, but not Hotspot.\nMy Mac remembers my old iPhone 6 and remembers the Hotspot password for that old connection. I think that my Mac thinks the new iPhone 7 is the old iPhone 6 because they have the same name. The Mac shows the Personal Hotspot item in the Wifi menu, where it used to work. When I select the item, the Mac tries to connect using the old password. Now, if I remembered the old password, I could change it on the new iPhone 7 side, but I don't remember the old password.\nI can see the password on the iPhone 7, and I want to input that password on the Mac. But I can't find the place on the Mac where I can delete the old password, or change it, or delete the Hotspot item and have it try again from scratch. It just keeps pounding away and telling me \"failed to enable Personal Hotspot...\"\nI tried Personal Hotspot through WiFi. I tried Personal Hotspot through Bluetooth. I tried rebooting. \nI just want to find the data on the Mac side and change or delete it (I think if I delete it then the Mac will try again from scratch and prompt me for my password).\nEDIT: I found the iPhone entry under the Network -> Advanced -> Wifi gadget and deleted it.  Still \"failed to enable.\"\n\nA: I took the pair of the Mac and the iPhone 7+ to the Apple store. I demonstrated the problem, we rebooted both machines, and demonstrated the problem persisting. \nThe troubleshooter gave the phone a \"Vulcan death pinch\" squeezing the lower volume key on the left simultaneously with the usual power key on the right, holding them until the phone fully rebooted to the Apple icon on the screen, releasing only then. He said it's a hard reset, and different on different iPhone model numbers. After that, we toggled the Personal Hotspot button in the Settings app on the iPhone, making sure it's on, and chose the Personal Hotspot from the wifi gadget on the upper right of the top menu bar of the Mac and the Mac asked for the Personal Hotspot password, which I copied off the phone. \nTo repeat and emphasize, we hard-reset the iPhone without changing the Mac.

The folder will be highlighted in light gray.\n\nA: Prior to High Sierra, you can drag the note over the list of folders in the sidebar. Each folder will highlight blue as you hover with the note, except All iCloud, Recently Deleted and most importantly the folder already containing the note.\nSince High Sierra, the folder is shown beside the note.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/uk/macos/high-sierra-preview/\n\nA: Though I know the question seems to focus on folder within the UI of the Notes app itself, I was interested in trying to find the actual source files so I could copy them all to Google Drive, since I prefer the Google ecosystem for syncing my data between devices. But Apple really really REALLY does not want you getting at the actual Notes files residing on your Mac. They are kept in a single file archive kind of like (I think) those old Windows Outlook .pst files that contained individual emails... A Macworld help article from 2014 is still mostly relevant in 2018 which reveals the obscure directory where the aggregated Notes file resides:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/\n\nI could not get there via the Finder's \"GO to Folder\" command — Apple's blocked that off too... And SEARCH will not find it either, even with \"include System files\" — unless you truncate it to just \ncom.apple.Notes\n\n...then sort by date and it will be the first of many such folders with that exact name... But thankfully you can then double-click on that folder and it's then easy to get to the nested Notes file.\nOr you could just matriculate down to the buried folder by selecting your \"Home\" Library folder in the GO Menu (or COMMAND-SHIFT-L )\nEither way, this is what Macworld says once you get there:\n\nYou should see a small assortment of similarly named files, with names\n  such as NotesV2.storedata. The text of all your notes, typically\n  including recently deleted notes, is stored within one or more of\n  these files. Unfortunately, the format of these files does not make it\n  easy to view the content of each note. To recover an individual note,\n  you have a bit more work to do.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The two files that offer the best bet for data recovery are the .storedata and (especially!) the .storedata-wal files. Make a copy of\n  these files and move them to a separate location, such as the desktop.\n  \n  \n  Making copies is a common safeguard. You’ll work with these copied\n  files. In case anything goes wrong, the original files remain\n  untouched and in place.\n\n  \n*Add an .html extension to the name of the copied files, confirming that you want to make this change when the question dialog box pops\n  up.\n  \n  \n  As it turns out, these files employ HMTL tags. Adding the extension\n  allows the critical text to appear in a more easily readable format.\n\n  \n*Open one of the files in a text processing app (such as TextEdit) or in a web browser. Interspersed among all the cryptic text should be\n  readable versions of both your current and recently deleted notes.\n  Because there can be a lot of data here, I suggest using the app’s\n  search feature to locate the text you want to recover. Once you have,\n  copy and save it to a separate location. If the first of the two files\n  does not bear fruit, try the other.\n  \n\nHope this helps. But it's not user friendly.

From there I choose \"Re-install MacOS\" and It gives me Yosemite installation. \nThe problem is, I don't want to install Yosemite, I want to install macOS Sierra but it is prompting me to download Yosemite. So I downloaded a Install macOS Sierra.dmg file from torrents and now I want to create a Bootable USB drive.\nWhile searching for solutions on net, I found poeple are installing from \"Install macOS Sierra**.app**\", not from \".dmg\" extension.\nQuesion\nPlease suggest me how would I create Bootable USB from Install macOS Sierra.dmg? I don't have \"*.app\" folder.\nI have access to my other machines with MacOS and Ubuntu to make it happen.\n\nA: Here's what you need to do, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Internet Recovery to install Yosemite, like you were doing earlier, and then either upgrade to macOS Sierra via the App Store or just download the macOS Sierra upgrade to create a macOS Sierra USB Installer from. \n\n*To create a macOS Sierra USB Installer you need a working Mac so you can download macOS Sierra from the App Store and with a blank USB stick run this command via Terminal. Make sure you first reformat the USB stick using Disk Utility to Mac OS X Extended (Journaled). Also rename the USB stick to: Untitled\nUse the following command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app --nointeraction\n\nThen perform a clean install using the macOS Sierra USB Installer.\n\nA: If you have \"Install macOS Sierra.dmg\", Install it and you will get the app \"Install mac OS Sierra.app\" installed on your applications folder.\nSo to be clear, installing \"Install macOS Sierra.dmg\" will not install Sierra OS on the current computer but only puts the \"Install macOS Sierra\" app inside the applications folder.\nThis way you get the app. And you create the bootable USB by running the command given by Maximus.\nHope this help!\n\nA: if you re-download the installer from app store you'r able to stop and resume your dl when is finished and prompt for rebot quit the installer, now you can find the installer on the Application folder, then follow the Maximus instructions\n", "Q: Missing dock icons I've got an issue with my new MacBook Pro 15″ (bought it two weeks ago).\nSome icons are missing from the Dock:\n\nThe first one is Terminal, and the second one is Todoist\nIf I close and reopen the application it fixes the issue, but it reappears quite often.\nDo you know what could be wrong with my Mac?\nHere are the specs:\n\n\nA: Current best answer to my problem thanks to bjbk's comment:\nMoving an app to a new location within the dock fixes the issue temporarily.\n", "Q: Does Safari have the feature \"Select an element in the page to inspect it\" as Chrome does?

This sends me a one-time password to my device and I type it in. That is what I was expecting.\nSo, how I do make this dialog go away without providing my iPhone password to my computer or my computer password to my iPhone?\nAlso, I note that I can set reminders (synced to Apple) on my computer and retrieve them on my phone. So clearly my account sync is working. What additional feature is the computer actually trying to set up with this dialog?\n\n\nA: This is not Apple's two-factor-authentication — this is iCloud keychain. To sync your keychain, you need to enter the password for the device asked. Other iCloud functionality will continue to work, since you've already passed 2FA.\n\nA: Just type in your password and 6-digit authorization code.\nWhy would Apple, the same company that refused to unlock the iPhone that was used by a San Bernardino shooter for the FBI, care for your password. You are insignificant to them since you're account is only one of 500 million iCloud accounts. In fact, that article showing the number of user accounts was from June 4, 2013; that's over 5 years ago.\n\nThis help page has a section that tells you how two-factor authentication works:\n\nWith two-factor authentication, your account can only be accessed on devices you trust, like your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. When you want to sign in to a new device for the first time, you'll need to provide two pieces of information—your password and the six-digit verification code that's automatically displayed on your trusted devices. By entering the code, you're verifying that you trust the new device. For example, if you have an iPhone and are signing into your account for the first time on a newly purchased Mac, you'll be prompted to enter your password and the verification code that's automatically displayed on your iPhone.\nBecause your password alone is no longer enough to access your account, two-factor authentication dramatically improves the security of your Apple ID and all the personal information you store with Apple.\nOnce signed in, you won’t be asked for a verification code on that device again unless you sign out completely, erase the device, or need to change your password for security reasons. When you sign in on the web, you can choose to trust your browser, so you won’t be asked for a verification code the next time you sign in from that computer.\n\nOnce you verify, the popup will never show up again on that device unless you reinstalled the OS or something similar to that action. You could even change your iPhone's password if you were still fearing that Apple is going to hunt you down.\n", "Q: Is there a way to stop inline video clips from playing on MacOS Safari?

I have seen forum posts out in the wild that suggest that AFP is \"dead\". I have seen this question and this post that states SMB is now the \"default\" protocol for Apple sharing.\nI am using FreeNAS and it allows you to select either AFP or SMB shares. I mostly use Mac clients, so it would seem that AFP would be the obvious choice, but if AFP is going away in future versions of macOS, then I don't want to be stuck with shares I cannot access and/or file systems I have to migrate from AFP to some other system.\nSo what is fact and what is fiction about the future of AFP? Will it stop working in future versions of macOS? I don't see how this is possible since Time Machine requires it. Can I safely use AFP without worrying about it \"dying\" on me? \n\nA: No one can answer that question except Apple. Everything else is just rumours and conjecture.\nHowever, the fact that Time Machine is based on AFP, and that AFP has seen many improvements to support Time Machine, could be seen as an indicator that AFP is here to stay for a little while.\nNote that Time Machine is fully supported over SMB, so if you can setup SMB just as well as AFP now - then SMB is probably going to be supported for the longest period of time from now.\n\nA: The new APFS only can be shared over SMB and NFS.\nAFP started deprecation in the fall of 2013 with 10.9 / Maverick\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/media/us/osx/2013/docs/OSX_Mavericks_Core_Technology_Overview.pdf\nWhen that transition hits, the answer will be yes AFP file sharing protocol can be considered removed.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/APFS_Guide/FAQ/FAQ.html\nOf course, you will still have APFS for older OS versions and potentially on newer versions if you do not convert and are not forced to convert your HFS based file systems to APFS.\nFrom the filesystems introduction of the link above:\n\nHFS+ and its predecessor HFS are more than 30 years old. These file systems were developed in an era of floppy disks and spinning hard drives, when file sizes were calculated in kilobytes or megabytes.\nA Developer Preview of Apple File System is available in macOS Sierra. Apple plans to release Apple File System as a bootable file system in 2017.\n\nTime Machine is fully supported over SMB. We won't know when apple pulls the trigger on walking away from HFS and AFP, but the writing is already up on Apple's very public developer website wall.\n\nA: Apple Filing Protocol is deprecated1, not \"dead\".  There's a big distinction and that is being deprecated, it's still included and still works at the time of last development but it has been superseded by something else - in this case SMB2.  It also means there will be no further development. \n\nWill it stop working in future versions of macOS?\n\nThere will come a point in which Apple no longer includes support for a particular protocol or service.  Only Apple will know this for certain.\n\nCan I safely use AFP without worrying about it \"dying\" on me?\n\nAFP is not going to die the same way cron didn't die when Apple went to launchd.  If you are running AFP today, you will have AFP tomorrow.  It won't be \"upgraded out\".  That said, Apple can decide tomorrow that future versions of macOS will no longer come with AFP; that won't break your existing macOS installation.\nWhat all this means is that as a deprecated protocol, manufacturers are going to stop including support for AFP in new products (like NAS devices) and systems admins should begin making plans to switch over to newer technologies.  Also, being deprecated, it's no longer the default file sharing protocol meaning you will (eventually) have to take explicit steps to enable/connect to AFP shares.\nIt's important to note that AFP does not support the new APFS (Apple File System) so newer versions of macOS (Sierra going forward) will not have the ability to serve AFP shares.2 \n\nYou can share APFS formatted volumes using the SMB network file sharing protocol. The AFP protocol is deprecated and cannot be used to share APFS formatted volumes.\n\nThough, they will probably include the AFP client so it can continue to connect to legacy devices/systems.\n\n1 Deprecated refers to a software or programming language feature that is tolerated or supported but not recommended. A deprecated attribute or feature is one that may eventually be phased out, but continues to be used in the meantime. Deprecation also helps to ward off backward compatibility issues, giving users time to migrate and begin using the newer recommended feature. The deprecated feature will continue to work in the current environment, but will show a warning message that the feature being used may be removed in future releases.

I created an AppleScript for cleaning up my desktop.  It essentially selects all files and folders on my desktop, creates a new folder with a specific name and date format, and moves all the files from my desktop to the new folder.  This script works beautifully until I realized that occasionally there were files or folders I wanted to remain on my desktop.  My solution was to open the get info window for each file or folder that I wanted to remain on my desktop, and select the “lock” option in the get info window.  \nMy problem is now because of the locked files, the script cannot completely execute without displaying an error message.  If I click “OK” on the error message, the script will finish and move every file with the exception of the ones that are locked.  \nI would prefer not to have to go through this extra step by clicking the okay button.

However it will still generate an error if there are any individual locked files.\n\nA: My approach would be to put some of your code into a try block and also use on error to ignore that specific error message, but to still display a message if it encounters a different error instead.\nThe advantage of this approach is that you're not telling your script to ignore all errors, just in case something else occurs and you should be aware of it.\nIn order to achieve this, try the following:\nset scriptPath to (load script file \"Macintosh HD:Users:Smokestack:Library:Mobile Documents:com~apple~ScriptEditor2:Documents:Cleanup Desktop.scptd:Contents:Resources:Scripts:Current Time A.M. P.M. And Short Date.scpt\")\n\ntell scriptPath\n    timeandDate() -- This will get the time and date in this format \"05/31/2017 @ 9:10:48 PM\" called from the loaded script file above\nend tell\n\nset timeandDate to the result -- This will copy the time and date results from the previous step and and set it as this new variable\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if running then\n        close every window\n        activate\n        make new Finder window\n        set target of Finder window 1 to folder \"Desktop\" of folder \"Smokestack\" of folder \"Users\" of startup disk\n    end if\n    open Finder window 1\n    activate\nend tell\n\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code 0 using (command down) -- This will select all files and folders on the desktop in the active finder window\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    try\n        set these_items to the selection\n        set destinationFolder to make new folder at POSIX file \"/Users/Smokestack/Jimz_Important_Stuff/Desktop_Cleanups/\" with properties {name:timeandDate}\n        move these_items to destinationFolder\n        reveal destinationFolder\n    on error error_message number error_number\n        if the error_number is not -50 then\n            display dialog error_message buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n        end if\n    end try\n\nend tell\n\nNow, you'll see that I've placed the second block of tell application \"Finder\" code within a try block (you'll notice the use of try and end try. And, within that block I've inserted the following code:\n    on error error_message number error_number\n    if the error_number is not -50 then\n        display dialog error_message buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n    end if\n\nBasically, this should have the effect of telling the script that in the event of a Finder error of -50 to just ignore it, but if it's not -50 then display the error. (I'm assuming that this is the error your script gets - if not you can just replace the -50 with the correct error number.\nObviously I can't test this at my end, so please let me know how you go.\n\nA: Update: As I mentioned somewhere in the comments that I'd build out a 10.12.5 system this past weekend and do some testing, I did.\nHere is what I found out:\n\n\n*\n\n*The code of my answer, inclusive of edit 5 on Jun 2 at 15:34, works on my system without issue.\n\n*After a review of all code and comments, it dawned on me that while my code, as is, worked on my system and I gave note referencing the delay command having to adjust values and or add/remove as/if necessary, etc., that this mainly comes down to timing issues and the pitfalls of that particular form of event coding.\nTherefore, and while I'll leave the original answer at the bottom of this update, I decided to look at this from a different programatic angle and offer the following code as a better way to code this script to accomplish the task at hand.\nThis new code, does not rely on closing opened Finder windows and then opening a Finder window to the Desktop folder of the User to then have System Events select all items in the target folder, or the use of the delay command to deal with timing issues etc. All of which I personally don't like, because I don't want all Finder windows I have opened, closed to accomplish a task such as this. Or code it to leave the existing windows opened while ensuring the Finder window of the Desktop folder within the Home folder is the topmost Finder window to ensure System Events selects the correct items and get the timings right, etc.!\nThe following AppleScript code offers a more safe and faster way to accomplish the task at hand and I encourage you to use it over the previous code examples.\nNote: With the previous caveats in play, (the existence of the folder the destination folder is created in, etc.), you should not not need to modify this code and should be able to use it as is. That is to say, you're certainly free to modify the code anyway you need/want, but as is, it should work.\nNew AppleScript code:\ntell current application\n    try\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            if running then\n                set theseFileSystemObjects to (get every item of (path to desktop))\n                set theFileSystemObjectsNotLocked to {}\n                repeat with i from 1 to (count of theseFileSystemObjects)\n                    set thisFileSystemObject to (item i of theseFileSystemObjects)\n                    if not locked of (get properties of thisFileSystemObject) then\n                        set end of theFileSystemObjectsNotLocked to thisFileSystemObject\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n                if theFileSystemObjectsNotLocked is not equal to {} then\n                    tell current application to set theDateTimeNow to ¬\n                        (do shell script \"date '+%m.%d.%Y @ %I.%M.%S %p'\") as string\n                    set theDestinationFolder to make new folder at ¬\n                        ((path to home folder as string) & \"Jimz_Important_Stuff:Desktop_Cleanups:\") with properties {name:theDateTimeNow}\n                    move theFileSystemObjectsNotLocked to theDestinationFolder\n                    open theDestinationFolder\n                    activate theDestinationFolder\n                end if\n            else\n                tell current application\n                    activate\n                    display dialog \"Finder is not currently running!\" & linefeed & linefeed & ¬\n                        \"Open Finder, then run Desktop Clean Up again.\" buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n                        default button 1 with title \"Desktop Clean Up\"\n                end tell\n            end if\n        end tell\n    on error eStr number eNum\n        activate\n        display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n            default button 1 with title \"Desktop Clean Up\" with icon caution\n        return\n    end try\nend tell\n\n\nOriginal Answer:\nThis is an example of how I'd write the entire script to be run, as is, as either a .scpt file or an .app file, on your system. I'm saying your system, because the target destination folder is set for your system.\nThere is no need to load an outside resource and no handler to set the value of the variable used for the destination folder name. I choose to use a do shell script command for that, using the date command to return a custom date time string variable, as it's one line of code compared to the amount of code in the on timeandDate() handler, and it returns the same pattern.\nI will continue to use this on my system with appropriately adjusted pathnames and a different pattern for the destination folders name, replacing the / and : with . in the custom date time string variable used in the destination folder name.\nAs coded, this first version of the script moves all file system objects, that are not locked, currently in the Desktop folder to the destination folder. The script includes minimal appropriate error handling and as coded you shouldn't have the issues you were previously having. This of course assumes that the $HOME/Jimz_Important_Stuff/Desktop_Cleanups folder exists. If not, you'll get the appropriate error message, however additional error handling could be added to create the hierarchical folded structure as/if necessary.\nThis first script should resolve all issues you are/were having with your own code and IMO is a better way to code it then just trapping and eating the error with just a try statement alone, because as coded, it can only move files that are not locked and doesn't even try to move a locked file.\nThis was tested under macOS 10.12.3 and should work for you on macOS 10.12.5, which you're presently running.\nAppleScript Code:\n\ntell current application\n    try\n        set theDateTimeNow to (do shell script \"date '+%m/%d/%Y @ %I:%M:%S %p'\") as string\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            if running then\n                close every window\n                set target of (make new Finder window) to (path to desktop)\n                activate\n                delay 0.5\n                tell application \"System Events\" to key code 0 using {command down}\n                delay 0.5\n                set theseFileSystemObjects to the selection\n                set theDestinationFolder to make new folder at ¬\n                    ((path to home folder as string) & \"Jimz_Important_Stuff:Desktop_Cleanups:\") with properties {name:theDateTimeNow}\n                set theListOfFileSystemObjectsNotLocked to {}\n                repeat with i from 1 to (count of theseFileSystemObjects)\n                    set thisFileSystemObject to (item i of theseFileSystemObjects)\n                    if not locked of thisFileSystemObject then\n                        set end of theListOfFileSystemObjectsNotLocked to thisFileSystemObject\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n                move theListOfFileSystemObjectsNotLocked to theDestinationFolder\n                reveal theDestinationFolder\n            else\n                tell current application\n                    activate\n                    display dialog \"Finder is not currently running!\" & linefeed & linefeed & ¬\n                        \"Open Finder, then run Desktop Clean Up again.\" buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n                        default button 1 with title \"Desktop Clean Up\" with icon caution\n                end tell\n            end if\n        end tell\n    on error eStr number eNum\n        activate\n        display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n            default button 1 with title \"Desktop Clean Up\" with icon caution\n        return\n    end try\nend tell\n\nNote: As to the value of the delay commands, they may need to be adjusted for your system and or additional ones added as/if necessary and or removed if not needed. As presently coded, this script worked without issue, dozens of times in testing on my system, with varying counts and sizes of file system objects being acted upon in the Desktop folder. Make any adjustments as necessary.\nThe file system objects tested were, files, folders, aliases, symlinks, application bundles and document bundles, the latter two of which are just folders. These FSOs were of various sizes, both locked and not locked.\n\nThis second version of the script goes beyond your expressed needs and makes a duplicate of the locked file system objects currently in the Desktop folder to the destination folder, while reseting the locked flag on the duplicates so they can be deleted without raising a flag at the time you may choose to delete them. I'm including it as it may have added value and you find it useful.\nAppleScript Code:\n\ntell current application\n    try\n        set theDateTimeNow to (do shell script \"date '+%m/%d/%Y @ %I:%M:%S %p'\") as string\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            if running then\n                close every window\n                set target of (make new Finder window) to (path to desktop)\n                activate\n                delay 0.5\n                tell application \"System Events\" to key code 0 using {command down}\n                delay 0.5\n                set theseFileSystemObjects to the selection\n                set theDestinationFolder to make new folder at ¬\n                    ((path to home folder as string) & \"Jimz_Important_Stuff:Desktop_Cleanups:\") with properties {name:theDateTimeNow}\n                set theListOfFileSystemObjectsNotLocked to {}\n                set theListOfLockedFileSystemObjects to {}\n                repeat with i from 1 to (count of theseFileSystemObjects)\n                    set thisFileSystemObject to (item i of theseFileSystemObjects)\n                    if not locked of thisFileSystemObject then\n                        set end of theListOfFileSystemObjectsNotLocked to thisFileSystemObject\n                    else\n                        set end of theListOfLockedFileSystemObjects to thisFileSystemObject\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n                move theListOfFileSystemObjectsNotLocked to theDestinationFolder\n                duplicate theListOfLockedFileSystemObjects to theDestinationFolder\n                repeat with i from 1 to (count of theListOfLockedFileSystemObjects)\n                    set thisFileSystemObject to (item i of theListOfLockedFileSystemObjects)\n                    set locked of alias ((theDestinationFolder as string) & name of thisFileSystemObject) to false\n                end repeat\n                reveal theDestinationFolder\n            else\n                tell current application\n                    activate\n                    display dialog \"Finder is not currently running!\" & linefeed & linefeed & ¬\n                        \"Open Finder, then run Desktop Clean Up again.\" buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n                        default button 1 with title \"Desktop Clean Up\" with icon caution\n                end tell\n            end if\n        end tell\n    on error eStr number eNum\n        activate\n        display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n            default button 1 with title \"Desktop Clean Up\" with icon caution\n        return\n    end try\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Microphone not working on third party apps only (iPhone 6) Recently my iPhone's mic has stopped working but solely for third party apps such as Whatsapp, Snapchat & Telegram. \nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting my phone\n\n*Updating my phone to the latest version\n\n*Using compressed air to clear any debris \n\n\nI have tested the mic via phone call, facetime & siri and these all work fine as expected. \nHas anyone experienced this issue?

Currently to export a 3gb video file in Final Cut Pro it takes 1 - 1.5 hours to export the file.

You can watch the memory usage during the export. If the memory pressure is green, then no amount of RAM will help speed up the export. \nAssuming RAM isn't the bottleneck, next to eliminate is the storage - watch the iops and data rates for read and write. That too is easy to benchmark - ssd gets higher iops than most single hard drive.

Maybe the upgrade in RAM won't be that expensive and a good trade-off while waiting for the new Mac purchase.

Many startups offer their premium version both via website and IAP. Lumosity is the example of such app. \nI know IAP is made for such cases, but since you can upgrade your account on their website, why do they use IAP and pay commision instead of redirecting to website to buy premium?\nIs it mandatory in iOS app that you have to support IAP for premium version even though user can upgrade his account via the website?\nI'm curious because in IAP commision is 30% while costs of operation on website are much lower.\nI mean, does these startups pay 30% to Apple just to allow users to unlock it from the app, instead of showing the message \"Please visit our website to upgrade to premium version\"\nWhat if someone has upgraded lumosity through their website - he doesn't have to use IAP, he just logs to the app and new features are available right away.\nDoes that mean the following? I run a SaaS product with price tag 50$/month. If someone pays me via my website, I'm lucky, my operational costs are low. If someone decides to upgrade via the iOS app - I have to accept 30% commision fee. \n\nA: Yes, it's mandatory. Per the App Store Review Guidelines:\n\nIf you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than IAP.\n\nSome services absorb the IAP premium on behalf of the user, but I've certainly seen some services that just charge 30% more to subscribe/upgrade within the app, than they charge if you do it directly on their website.\n", "Q: Automatically Edit Plist files with Automator So I'd like to edit a plist file property using automator.\nI need to change the value of a key so that it's set to 1 minute before the automator app was launched.

I don't believe its possible to obtain the start time of the automator script, so you'll have to settle with a time stamp relative to the time when the shell script is executed. If you really need the start time, you'll have to add an action to record it yourself as the first step in the automator script.\nIn the shell, time computation is done with date.\ndate -v 1M\n\ngives you the time one minute ago. If you really need it formatted in the specific way that you give above, you need to format it yourself, like so\ndate -v -1M '+%b %d, %Y, %H:%M:%S %p'\n\nHere, %b, %d etc are place holders for the various timestamp components; see the man page for strftime.\nNext, you need to know how to change a plist file. You can use plutil for that, like so\nplutil -replace SULastCheckTime -string newvalue foo.plist\n\nPutting it all together, the shell script could read\ntime=`date -v -1M '+%b %d, %Y, %H:%M:%S %p'`\nplutil -replace SULastCheckTime -string \"$time\" foo.plist\n\nHere, the backticks take the output of date and put it in a variable time; plutil then puts it in a file.\nIf you are going to use shell scripts anyway, you may consider dropping automator altogether in favor of shell scripts.\n", "Q: iPhone Apps on iPad and UI distortion Why do some iPhone apps have distorted User Interfaces (UI) when run on iPads? How can iPhone apps run on iPads at all?\n\nA: Internally iPhones and iPads are very similar. They are both have the same operating system iOS, are programmed using the same language (Swift or Objective C), using the same tools (say XCode). Thus the logic of iPhone apps will work on Ipads and Vice Versa. However, iPhones and Ipads have different screen sizes and pixel densities, which the developer must take into account when writing the app. Otherwise the GUI (ie \"app's screen\"), will not look correct. \nLet me explain in more detail, suppose you're developing an App, which shows a square to the user. You could simply program the square to have sides of say L = 2000 pixels. However, different screens have different numbers of pixels, and different pixel densities. Thus on a 1920x1080 monitor, you couldn't see the square, while on a 4 or 5k monitor the square would show up fine. Thus, as a developer, you must write your App so that it is able to compensate for the size and pixel density of the display. \nSize can be accounted for by parameterizing your variables in terms of the screen size, in other words, making the variable a function of the screen size. For example, say the display has width = x, and height = y. To make sure the square fits on the screen, we can set the length of the side L = min{x/2,y/2}. Thus no side of the square will be larger than either half the height or width of the screen, whichever is smaller. Therefore, by defining each element of the UI in proportion to the screen size in pixels, all the App needs is the new screen size, and it can adjust the UI automatically if it has been coded as described. If an app has not been coded as described, then it cannot change its size to fit the screen, and thus can only be viewed at its original resolution (say the resolution of the iPhone) on a subset of the screen (say the iPpad).  \nCompensating for different pixel densities is harder, and is discussed in this article. \nP.S. In researching this article, I learned that iOS developers are required to submit 3 different size images. Thus the bitmap images can scale along with the parameterized elements of the UI. See here, here, here.

I'm using FreeNAS and it has the option to share data using SMB or AFP. Since I recently learned that AFP is being deprecated, I'm hesitant to use AFP but I'v read that AFP supports Server Side Copy and SMB on Mac does not.\nI want to confirm both points with the Ask Different crowd:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does macOS Sierra connecting to a FreeNAS server via AFP support Server Side Copy?\n\n*Does macOS Sierra connecting to a FreeNAS server via SMB support Server Side Copy?\n\n\nBased on release notes, FreeNAS supports Samba 4.1.4 (SMB3), and thus supports Server-Side Copy when connect with compatible clients.\n\nA: *\n\n*Unfortunately, the source code of the AFP driver is not free software, so it's difficult to give a definitive answer on that. However, it appears that Netatalk supports copyfile, so it's likely that the answer to that question is yes.\n\n*If you look at the source code of the latest version of the macOS smbfs driver, you can see that it does implement the copyfile operation (see smbfs_vnop_copyfile)\nAccording to the release notes, OS X did that since ca. 2013:\n\n8) Added Server Side Copies (OS X SMB Client <-> OS X/Windows SMB File\n  Server)\n\nWhether that actually gets used with FreeNAS, I cannot tell - I have no access to a FreeNAS system.\n", "Q: Boot Camp Assistant can't install Windows after partition made and booted to USB installer?

The SMB protocol itself is pretty important for our group's workflow since we use it to connect to a shared drive where all of long-term storage and shared files. \nThe issue is that with that regards, Google was of no help to me - whereas I found instructions to disable SMB altogether, there is nothing relative to SMB1 specifically. \nIs this due to the fact that OSX has no support for SMB1 and never had (migrating directly to SMB2/3 from AFP)? If not, what are the steps to follow to disable SMB1 specifically on a client machine?\nSome more information: MacOS in question is a Sierra 10.12.3\n\nA: You can't really disable the SMB1 client protocol because SMB2 is backward compatible with SMB1.  What you can do, however, is specify that the SMB client only negotiate via SMB 2.x.\nTo disable SMB1 create an /etc/nsmb.conf (global settings) and/or ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf (user local settings) with the following:\n# Configuration file for foo.bar\n  [default]\n  smb_neg=smb2_only\n\nIf you set this in the global location (/etc/nsmb.conf) you will need Admin privileges to modify.  If your Macs are \"locked down,\" meaning users don't have Admin privileges, this essentially locks out the user from enabling SMB1 and effectively disabling the SMB1 protocol.  \nSecondly, what you should do is at a server level disable SMB1 by default.  This way, when any client attempts to connect, the Mac client will automatically switch from SMB1 to SMB2/3 as needed.  If it's not enabled on the server the client won't matter.\n", "Q: What's this separate \"Phone\" task section in app switcher?

This school iPad is not letting me get games or anything like that so I'm asking how can you transfer games from a mac computer onto a school iPad?\n\nA: Your school iPad is being managed with some sort of Mobile Device Management (MDM) software.  Companies and (especially) schools use it with devices they distribute so they can effectively manage who uses and what gets used on the devices (like iPads) that they deploy throughout the organization.\nThis MDM software is the \"teeth\" in your school's Acceptable Use policy (AUP).  If you remember from the beginning of the school year when the devices were distributed, there was something that you and/or your parents signed indicating that you would abide by their rules/regulations for use of the device.  \nThe MDM software is the technological component to ensure students abide by the policies/rules of the organization.\nUnless your school policy changes in someway to allow the loading of unauthorized software, you simply can't.\n\nA: You can't. The school has restrictions on the iPad saying you aren't allowed to download apps.

The only connection options I see possibly working are gigabit ethernet or USB.\nI'm not sure if Migration Assistant will even use USB to connect two Macs. Even if it did, I'm at the mercy of the slower USB 2.0 port on the Mac Pro.\nIs it possible to transfer data using USB and if so, is USB faster or is it faster to use gigabit Ethernet?\n\nA: You have three options to connect two Mac's together to transfer settings via Migration Assistant:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ethernet\n\n*Firewire\n\n*Thunderbolt\n\n\nThere's no option to connect via USB.  Academically speaking, connecting via USB would be your slowest connection because it's only 480Mb/s (USB 2.0) versus Ethernet at 1Gb/s or Firewire 800 at 800Mb/s.  Thunderbolt isn't available on a 2009 Mac Pro\nThe easiest thing to do is to get a USBC to Ethernet Adapter and connect via the onboard Ethernet on the Mac Pro.  I recommend this over the Firewire for three reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's faster than Firewire\n\n*You probably already own a Ethernet cable; you would have to purchase a Firewire cable specifically for this\n\n*You are more likely to need the Ethernet adapter than you will a Thunderbolt to Firewire adapter \n\n", "Q: How to caffeinate a function on CLI?

For example:\nfunction mysleep {\n  sleep 2\n}\n\ncaffeinate mysleep    # mysleep: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: caffeinate launches executables. However, shell functions exist only within the shell. Shell functions are not executables.\nWorkaround: call bash directly\nThis works best for one-liners and simple commands. \ncaffeinate bash -c 'sleep 2'\n\nMulti-liners work too:\ncaffeinate bash <<EOF\n  sleep 2\n  echo \"done :D\"\nEOF\n\nYou can use functions:\ncaffeinate bash <<EOF\n  function mysleep {\n    sleep 2\n  }\n  mysleep\nEOF\n\nWorkaround: call a script instead of a function\nInstead of doing your work inside a function, split it out into a separate script:\ncaffeinate mysleep.sh\n\n#!/bin/bash\n# mysleep.sh\nsleep 2\n\n\nA: Per the man page:\ncaffeinate -- prevent the system from sleeping on behalf of a utility\nA function is not a utility as a utility will have a process ID (pid) associated with it.  When you specify a utility, caffeinate forks a process and holds an assertion that prevents sleep until that process is complete.\n\nA: caffeinate requires that there be an object to run, a function does not fill this requirement.\nChange your function into a shell script and it will work fine. So for your example:\n`#!/bin/bash \nsleep 2\n\nsaved into a file called mysleep and then caffeinate mysleep will work fine (so long as the file mysleep is in your system PATH.).\n`\n", "Q: Is it possible to force the MacBook Pro HDMI output to specific resolution/refresh rate? I have a MacBookPro11,2 connected via HDMI to a 4K television. I would like to try driving the display at various resolutions and frequencies, to see if that might alleviate some problems with signal stability. However the Displays prefpane only offers me a list of \"scaled\" resolutions, all of which are interpolated up to 4K, meaning the HDMI signal and monitor are still operating at 4K. Is it possible to foce the HDMI output to a specific (lower) resolution/refresh rate?\n\nA: The answer is: Yes, this is possible.\nI found a piece of trialware called SetResX that lets you set arbitrary real resolutions on the HDMI output, and it works!\nI also found a video tutorial here that explains how to do that yourself with a substantial bit of effort, and without the nice UI, but I haven't tried that method.\n\nA: Additional answer, to combine with @ruief's answer to use SwitchResX (which I agree works really well, having found it from @ruief's answer and tried it!):\n\n\n*\n\n*Be sure to use a Mini DisplayPort (i.e. thunderbolt) to DisplayPort connector, not an HDMI to HDMI connector - you will likely find a lot more available resolutions; namely, everything that the monitor and MacBook can support which is higher resolution than 1920 x 1080 (aka 1080p)\n\n\nI am not sure if the above is different between MacBooks? It made a huge difference on my MacBook Pro Retina 13-inch Late 2012; adding genuine resolutions (i.e. as reported by the monitor's OSD, not just scaled displays in other resolutions) up to 2560 x 1600 60Hz - which just weren't there with the HDMI cable.\nYou might also want to check out this article by Stephen Foskett, which recommends enabling MST-mode on the monitor itself to access even higher resolutions on older MacBooks. However, in my own case I can report that I did not have to enable MST, and that I did eventually get a perfectly usable 4k (3840 x 2160) 27Hz (!) mode (genuinely, as reported by the OSD of the monitor itself) working on my Late 2012 Intel HD Graphics 4000 MacBoo Pro with an ASUS VP28U 4k monitor!!! Definitely no way that could have been achieved without SwitchResX!\nFinally, it's also worth noting that another tool, simpler to use than SwitchResX and without the ability to define new modes, but still with the ability to show the 'hidden' resolutions, is RDM which can be installed via a download link from the GitHub page, or via Brew (brew install avibrazil-rdm).\n\nA: According to Apple, connecting your 4K TV to your HDMI port is only supported at either 3840x2160 or 4096x2160 resolutions.\n\nYou can use 4K displays and Ultra HD TVs at the following resolutions\n  and refresh rates via the built-in HDMI port of your Mac: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*3840x2160 at 30 Hz refresh rate \n  \n*4096x2160 at 24 Hz refresh rate (mirroring is not\n  supported at this resolution)\n  \n\nPer the specs of your TV, it supports 480i to 4K resolutions on HDMI.  It also has PC input (VGA):\n\nCompatible Modes\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*TV Tuner: NTSC/ATSC \n  \n*Component: 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i, 1080P \n  \n*HDMI: 480i, 576i, 480P, 576P, 720P, 1080i, 1080P,\n  3840×2160/30Hz, 3840×2160/60Hz \n  \n*PC: SVGA, XGA \n  \n*Optimum Resolution: 3840x2160\n  \n\nIf you want to get lower resolutions I recommend connecting to the VGA port on your TV (per the specs, it has a VGA port and using an HDMI to VGA adapter to drop the signal resolution.  \n", "Q: mac terminal displaying other name than host name I have recently been in terminal and somehow I lost my Mac name.

It is easily downloaded and installed and includes the same libraries as ffmpeg. (I know you say it doesn't work in your case but I include it here for others who might end up at this question.)\nThe version of ffmpeg you want is the 64-bit static build, preferably in a DMG as that is the easiest one to install. Using homebrew would be an even easier way to get it installed.\nAs for homebrew it is fairly well explained on their home page. You don't actually need XCode, just the XCode command line tools which homebrew will download for you the first time you use it to install something.\nOnce you install ffmpeg then man ffmpeg will get you the manual for it. You might prefer \nman -t ffmpeg | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app/\nwhich will open the man page in Preview where you can read it more easily, or even print it.\n\nA: This can take some guess-work out of working with FFmpeg : https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/35846/ffworks\n", "Q: Can Airport Time Capsule encrypted backups be hacked open from internet?

My iPhone was right next to me with a full signal, but did not receive the code.\nWhat's the point in that? This seems a bug to me, unless anyone knows any different?\n\n\nA: This is not a bug. The attack that is being prevented here is the case where someone would steal your password and log into your account from their own machine.\nSo in this case, two factor helps us establish trust by proving that it is in fact you who is trying to log into iCloud and not some attacker who stole only your password. The ways in which we can achieve this can be classified as \"something you have\", \"something you are\" and \"something you know\".\nIn this case, your password is \"something you know\". Your iPhone and Mac are both \"something you have\". Remember, your Mac is signed into iCloud already and is trusted by Apple on system level.\nIf someone did steal your password (the something you know), they would still require access to either your Mac OR your iPhone. These are both \"something you have\". As stated previously, your Mac is already trusted by Apple, so presenting this two factor code on your Mac is no less secure than presenting it on your iPhone. For an attack to be successful, the attacker would have to steal your password as well as obtain access to one of your trusted devices (your Mac or iPhone). So two factor is just as valid being presented on your phone as on your Mac.\n", "Q: How to update a command-line program using Homebrew? curl is a command line tool for transferring data with URLs. It is installed on my system as version 7.51.0. According to the tool's homepage, its current version number is 7.54.0. I'd like to update my copy of this tool to the latest version.\nAccording to the Releases and Downloads page of curl's website, the latest version can be installed on Mac OS X using Homebrew.\nHow can I use Homebrew to update my copy of curl to the latest version? Is updating the same as installing? If so, then the answer to my question is:\n> brew install curl\n\nBut is there a different way to update an already existing program?\n\nA: Simply no. Only Apple can update programs in /usr/bin etc.\nHowever you can make your scripts find the program from Homebrew first. You do this by making your $PATH have /usr/local/bin (which is where Homebrew puts links to the executables) earlier in the $PATH than OS supplied programs. \n", "Q: Mid 2014 Macbook Pro randomly stops responding (keyboard and trackpad won't do anything) My girlfriend's MacBook Pro randomly stops responding - everything on the laptop keeps working as per usual (i.e. video will continue to play as if nothing was wrong) but absolutely no keyboard inputs or trackpad movements are registered - the only thing we can do is hold down the power button to force turn off the Mac then restart it.\nI've tried resetting both the SMC and PRAM to no avail. It seems quite sporadic and I believe it's some sort of software issue rather than hardware (especially since the power button does actually work, even though nothing else does)\nAny ideas please? Thank you!\n\nA: This will probably sound strange, but I had a short of similar issue on my MacBook Pro.\nIt turned out I was somehow accidentally managing to trigger the \"Swipe between full-screen apps\" gesture just a tiny almost imperceptible bit. It took me ages to figure this out. But while it is partially through a swipe nothing else seems to register on the keyboard or trackpad.\nIf this is the problem you can just do a little horizontal three or four (depending on how you have it set) finger wiggle to reset it, or turn the swipe off in System Preferences.\n\n", "Q: Always show function keys on control strip when using terminal I would like to show the function keys when using the terminal app. However, when I use system preferences to try to set this up in Keyboard Shortcuts, the Terminal app is not selectable.\nScreenshots:\n\n\n\nA: The reason for this is that Apple doesn't seem to treat its Terminal app in the same way as other apps in terms of permanently setting Functions keys in the Touch Bar. Instead, you need to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Terminal app\n\n*Go to View > Customize Touch Bar\n\n*Drag the Function keys onto the Touch Bar\n\n*Click Done\nAnother option is to use another app as your terminal (such as iTerm2) and follow the usual steps for permanently setting the Function keys on the Touch Bar.\nBased on your screenshots, it seems you know the steps for doing this, but just to be sure and for the benefit of others:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Select the Keyboard preference pane\n\n*Click on the Shortcuts tab\n\n*In the left sidebar, select the Function Keys option\n\n*On the right-hand side click on the plus + button\n\n*Search for the app you want to use (e.g. iTerm2)\n\n*Add the app\n\n\nNow, whenever you are using the app, the Touch Bar should display all the function keys.\n", "Q: USB-C to VGA adapter Apple TV 4 Just out of curiosity: Is it possible to use an USB-C to VGA adapter with the 4th generation Apple-TV by placing the adapter in the USB-C service port?\n\nA: No.\nFrom AppleInsider: \"Unlike with the 12-inch MacBook, which uses the USB-C port for both charging and syncing, the USB-C connection on the Apple TV will only be used for diagnostics purposes.\"\nAlso, from AppDevice \"The USB-C cable offers the only way for the new Apple TV to interface with a computer for things like taking screenshots of screen recordings from the device and, more important, restoring the device to factory settings via iTunes (in the event that over-the-air restore doesn’t work).\"\n", "Q: Safari gone from iPhone 6 Plus My Safari app is missing from my iPhone.

You'll be able to \"download\" it back.\nIf the app has been deleted, in order to restore your data it depends on if you synchronized Safari bookmarks/history with iCloud.\nEDIT : apparently the native apps are simply hidden.\n", "Q: Missing swap file since latest update- Sierra I noticed the swap file went missing after the latest update to Sierra (10.12.5) though swap seems to be working.\nvm_stat\nMach Virtual Memory Statistics: (page size of 4096 bytes)\nPages free:                             2152219.\nPages active:                            898204.\nPages inactive:                          276296.\nPages speculative:                       437656.\nPages throttled:                              0.\nPages wired down:                        427700.\nPages purgeable:                         133196.\n\"Translation faults\":                  67396051.\nPages copy-on-write:                    6410771.\nPages zero filled:                     30858807.\nPages reactivated:                           31.\nPages purged:                             42928.\nFile-backed pages:                       715857.\nAnonymous pages:                         896299.\nPages stored in compressor:                   0.\nPages occupied by compressor:                 0.\nDecompressions:                               0.\nCompressions:                                 0.\nPageins:                                 414848.\nPageouts:                                     0.\nSwapins:                                      0.\nSwapouts:                                     0.\n\nHas anyone else seen this behavior and can confirm it’s intended and/or harmless?\n\nA: In previous versions of OS X I always had at least one swapfile. That never went 'away'. Regardless of how much RAM was available.\nBut since Mavericks the memory management improved steadily (including zram-like vm-compression) and on the latest macOS after a fresh reboot I also do not see a swapfile. It gets then created as needed. \nOnly if you have low amounts of RAM in the machine and never see such a file created is there a reason for concern. \nIf you open a few apps and then Safari with a few tabs filled you shall see those files again.\n\nA: Swapfiles, by their very nature, are ephemeral, and are created & destroyed at the whim of the OS.\nPerhaps the update process deleted the swapfile as it would have contained outdated, and thus useless data, especially if it contained data germane only to the previous version of the OS. \n", "Q: How to find files in the Finder I think I'm doing something wrong with my use of the Finder, but I can't tell what.\nI was trying to find a .jar file, and I realize I don't know whether the Finder can't find it or it doesn't exist.  So I started looking for folders and files that I know exist, to confirm or deny that the Finder is getting the right commands from me.\nThere is a folder at ~/.m2/, and when I look for it in the Finder, it can't find it.  I also searched for a file within the ~/.m2/ directory, and it couldn't find that.  \nThis is where I'm confused.  Sometimes, the Finder returns results quickly, and other times, I'm not really sure if anything is happening or not.  Right now, it says 'Searching 'All My Files'\" as the title of the Finder window.  Does that mean the search is still in progress?  Or is that just a title?  I'm not sure.\nIt also doesn't say, \"Search done, found X results\" or \"Search in progress\", or anything.  There's no pinwheel, no information.  I have no idea whether it's still preforming a search or not.\nWhat am I doing wrong?  How do I use the Finder to find my files?\nThe hardware I'm using is Macbook Pro, OS version 10.12.4.\n\nA: ~/.m2/ has a dot as the first character of the directory name. This is a hidden folder, so isn't indexed by Spotlight. Finder won't find this because it's not in Spotlight's index. Rename the folder without the dot for the folder to be indexed.\nSearching with Finder uses Spotlight so should be near-instantaneous. You can show the status bar with View → Show Status Bar (⌘/) and a pinwheel will appear at the right of the bar when Finder is still searching, disappearing after the search is complete.\n\nA: Finder can't find\nThe \"Finder\" is actually pretty terrible at finding things from a UX perspective. I'm not fond of Spotlight either (replace that with Quicksilver or Alfred). Neither one wants to help you find hidden directories and files (the ones with a . at the beginning of their name). Those are the most fun ones!\nTerminal is your friend\nHaving used OSX since the very beginning (I know we're not supposed to call it \"X\" anymore), I've come to the conclusion that it's better to just learn how to use Terminal.app. It is especially excellent at finding anything and everything exactly as you instruct it.\nIn your case, you want to find all files. Not all as Finder.app defines it, but really all files. In Terminal, you just add the -a option to show all. Add -type d to only find directories. To search for part of the name, include * as a \"wildcard\" character. All of that together looks something like this:\nfind Directory/SubDirectory -a -type d -name *m2\n\nFor more on the power of find, type man find into the Terminal and hit enter, or just read this great article. And never bother with trying to find things in Finder.app again.\n\nA: I used a Mac app 'easy-find' just last night for same problem. I was looking for my .bash_profile file using the finder.  easy-find found it for me. It is a free app.\n", "Q: Fixed region/dimension screen snipping tool basically I'm looking to press a single keyboard shortcut, similar to Cmd+Shift+4, except rather than having to draw my own box, I'd like a box of a predefined dimension appear, such as 300px x 300px that I can move around. \nOr an alternative would be to have Cmd+Shift+4 work at a fixed aspect ratio, for example hold down alt and it will be locked to 1:1\nThe only tool I've found to do this is Snapz X Pro but the price is a bit crazy when I only need it for make screen snips.\nMy job has a task that requires making multiple (dozens or hundreds) of 1:1 screenshots of various things, I can't fiddle with the mouse down to the pixel. I also can't deal with going through 3 menus and saving and typing my own file name either, but that wouldn't be the end of the world.\nIf I could just lock the aspect ratio with Cmd+Shift+4 I could start large and batch resize the snips when I'm done, that would be a good alternative. \n\nA: You can use the screencapture tool, part of macOS:\nscreencapture -x -Rx,y,w,h /path/to/capture.png\n\nx,y is the coordinates of the top-left point of the rectangle,\nw,h is the dimensions of the rectangle,\n-x mutes the capture.\nYou could wrap this in an Automator workflow or Keyboard Maestro macro and customise it to your desired output.\n", "Q: Mouse freezes when a second mouse is plugged in I use a wireless Logitech trackball for RSI reasons.  My wife uses a random dell usb mouse because she hates the trackball.  We have a single Mac mini and use fast user switching to change accounts.\nOn both accounts, the trackball stops tracking.  It'll move the cursor for a while and then stop mid-motion.  The buttons still work.  \nOn the login window, the mouse works.  When I log in from there, it works for up to a minute.  Then it dies again.  \nI had no issues with this mouse on my previous machine (linux) and the issue started immediately when I switched to this mac.  \nEquipment:  2014 Mac Mini running Sierra.  Logitech m570 trackball.  Generic dell usb other mouse.\n\nA: I might have fixed this.  Not sure yet, but it's been usable for a whole 10 minutes which is a new record.\nThe fix?  I shuffled usbs until I found a permutation that works.  Didn't think that would be a problem in 2017, but here we are.\n\nA: I've had this happen too, also where I could move the mouse but not click. I always had to turn off the connected mouse, then turn it back on and that seemed to fix the problem for me.\n", "Q: How do I find out how many photos, videos are stored in iCloud? I'm trying to track a problem with my wife's iPhone Photos app taking about 7GB despite \"Optimize storage\" being enabled. I want to compare her phone to mine since I suspect that it's storage full res versions.\n\nA: Open the Photos app. In the bottom-right corner, tap Albums, then the top-left album named All Photos.\nAt the bottom of that album, you will see the exact number of photos and videos in your photo library, including any Hidden photos.\nOptimize Storage doesn't mean that photos are never downloaded from iCloud. iOS will download higher-resolution versions of your photos and videos as they are viewed/zoomed/edited/shared. These higher-resolution photos will not be purged until space is needed.\nIt is normal for the amount of storage taken up by the Photos app to grow over time. On my 128 GB iPhone, I have 60 GB of storage taken up by photos and videos (out of a 140 GB library), even with Optimize Storage selected. But since I also have 30 GB free, there is no need for iOS to delete anything yet.\n", "Q: How to print a four pages on one page?

(It is 26 pages all in all, so I want to have 7 papers printed having four pages from the pdf on each and having two on the last one). How is it possible to set?\n\nA: You can do 4-up printing from most macOS applications in the standard print dialog.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose File menu > Print (Command-P)\n\n*If there's a Show Details button, click it. (If there's a Hide Details button instead, you're already in the right mode.)\n\n*Find the printer options pop-up menu somewhere in the print dialog.

I have in the offices an Apple TV with a custom app that allows each office to see a dashboard with data. \nThe problem is that this data is in the main server, in the office headquarters. Is there any way I can setup a PPTP/L2TP VPN connection (something always on) in the Apple TV so that the app could gather the data from the main server?\nPS. Opening the data in a public link or changing the app is not an option. \n\nA: One way to do this is to use a router or Mac to connect to the VPN and then share that connection with the Apple TV.\nBelow is one example of how you could do this using a Mac. This should also give you the basic idea if you need to do something similar with a Windows machine or router1.\nShare VPN from a Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your Mac to the internet via ethernet cable (i.e. connect it to a router, modem, etc via ethernet)\n\n*Set up your VPN connection in System Preferences > Network (obviously you'll need the address and authentication details to do this)\n\n*Click on the Advanced... button\n\n*Ensure you tick the Send all traffic over VPN connection checkbox\n\n*You will also want to make sure that the two Disconnect options are not enabled\n\n*Click OK\n\n*Ensure you also tick the checkbox for Show VPN status in menu bar\n\n*Now go to System Preferences > Sharing\n\n*Highlight (but do not tick) the Internet Sharing service in the lefthand pane\n\n*On the righthand side, select the VPN connection you created at Step 2 from the Share your connection from drop-down menu\n\n*Now select the Wi-Fi port (i.e. tick the checkbox)\n\n*Click on the Wi-Fi Options... button\n\n*Give your new Wi-Fi network a name, password etc\n\n*Click OK\n\n*Now tick the Internet Sharing service in the lefthand pane\n\n\n1 It's impossible to give you precise steps as routers vary significantly. However you would need to ensure your router is capable of doing this and will need to refer to its user guide.\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can also share a Wi-Fi connection via ethernet (although I suspect that's not practical in the case of a Mac > Apple TV.\n\n*If you can't connect your Mac to a router/modem via ethernet at Step 1, you could use a Ethernet to Wireless adapter instead. This just means the adapter is connecting to your usual Wi-Fi network and that you're connecting your Mac to the adapter via Ethernet.\n\n*Since you want this to be an always on connection, it'd mean your Mac will need to always remain on. It's also why Step 5 above is important. You may also need to adjust your System Preferences > Energy Saver settings.\n\n\nNow, whenever your Mac is connected to the VPN, it will share the connection via Wi-Fi. This means you can connect any device to the new Wi-Fi network you created at Step 13 (such as your Apple TV). \nUsing the VPN connection\nTo make this work with your Apple TV:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Mac, click on the new VPN Status icon in the menu bar\n\n*Select the Connect option pertaining to the VPN connection created previously\n\n*Once the connection is established, your Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar will change to indicate your Mac is now sharing the VPN via Wi-Fi\n\n*Now go to your Apple TV and connect it to this Wi-Fi network\n\n", "Q: How to change the spell-check to British -ize in Mac?

How to fix it?\nThe detail of my MacBook Pro is as follows:\n\n\nA: The lack of a charging indicator light is not a good sign, as it implies a hardware problem of some sort (i.e. cable, charger and/or MBP).\nHowever, one thing you could do is reset the System Management Controller (SMC) to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac\n\n*Unplug the power cable from your Mac\n\n*For 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the shiftcontroloption keys (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*After 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button \n\n*Plug in the power cable\n\n*Turn your Mac back on with the power button.\n\n\nIf the problem still persists after doing this, an easy test to do is to see what happens if you use another charger/cable. If the problem still persists with another charger/cable, then you really should run Apple Diagnostics (you can also run diagnostics in the meantime if you haven't got access to another charger/cable).\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n\nA: my laptop had this same problem of not charging. I visited this page and followed the instructions to reset the SMC but that failed and ofcourse diagnostic is practically useless since it keeps asking you to \"Connect the power adapter\" which won't work because that's the problem in the first place. \nI had to replace my charging port. That fixed my laptop. Hopefully this saves someone time and worring. It cost me N15,000 ($41.32).\n\nA: I have been struggling with the same issue for a month. I tried everything to solve the problem including SMC reset, removing battery and etc. Finally, ten minutes ago, I sprayed both the charging connector and charging port with electrical contact cleaner spray and the problem was solved! Before try it be sure you turned off your MacBook Pro.\n\nA: This appears to be a common issue with this kind of machine. Louis Rossmann describes how to address a motherboard repair on his videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HUyEykicEQ .\n\nA: Could the charging port and/or charging connector be obscured by dust and debris? Maybe a dash of compressed air might clear it out enough to make a successful contact? Do not use any liquids to try and clean there. \nHappened to me once...\n\nA: I had similar issue, but the charging indicator was orange.\nAccording to the system report, the health was normal. Tried resetting the SMC, didn't help.\nI ran diagnostics after which the battery said \"Service Battery\". I also drained the battery to 0% and then it started charging again. \nNow it shows my max capacity is at about 40% of the design capacity (according to cocunut battery) so I will have to replace it eventually, but at least it's not a hardware issue (DC IN board or something on the motherboard).\n", "Q: iOUSBFamily or USB Prober.app equivalent for macOS High Sierra?

AFAIK, Apple provided no rationale or explanation for this decision (no surprise there). This may lead some to speculate that it was a petty motivation - as a Google product, perhaps it's the \"not invented here\" syndrome? I'll stick my neck out, and speculate that Apple will never support webp. Note also that Safari is notably absent from the list of browsers supporting webp.\nAs @Allan mentioned, Google has provided a webp library, and they have published the sources for their webp library. There is a GitHub repo for webp, but it's an empty facade - perhaps to prevent others from creating a repo under that name?\nGoogle's licensing appears to be non-standard. I won't comment further as I'm a layperson in IP matters.\nGoogle's webp library includes several command-line utilities. It can be installed with MacPorts (sudo port install webp). For me (my use case), the utilities are useless: \n\n\n*\n\n*They provide no useful conversions, as they do not decode to the GIF format. \n\n*Animated webp files are crudely rendered by vwebp via OpenGL in one size only. \nOne of the answers here references the WebPQuickLook repo on GitHub. But as of this writing, this repo appears to be abandoned as there have been no changes to the repo files in 2 years. \nThe macOS App Store has several utilities that claim some level of support for webp. I've not tried them, but I generally shun the App Store due to several poor experiences. \n\nA: Would like to add a further update. 9/21/2020.\nWhile the GitHub repo for webp does work in preview, there is still no support for animated webp in preview. I have found that Pixea from the apple store does a fairly decent version of converting and viewing webp, but it's neither fast, nor that functional.\nTempted to write an extension for Chrome that will show a local directory image browser with thumbnail images, since loading a local webp images and animated images in Chrome is instant.

Is there a roadmap for it?\nI have a Fusion drive so that would affect my personal situation but I am just asking the general question.\n\nA: Apple's new file system, APFS, supports snapshots.  Per their documentation:\n\nAPFS is available in 10.12.x (Sierra) as a Developer Preview and as a released product in 10.13.x (High Sierra).\nEarlier than Sierra, if you need to make a \"point in time\" backup, it's best to run Time Machine to ensure a good backup.\n\nA: If you can't wait for APFS, you could look into OpenZFS, an implementation of Sun/Oracle's ZFS filesystem.

I would, however, like a \"persistent\" boot USB. Can this be done? So far I have tried the following to modify the \"live\" USB but would I be better off making a persistent USB on Windows and hoping it runs on Sierra?  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Per these Enterprise Installation instructions (from version 0.4.0), this seems like it might be an option:  \n\n\n\n6) OPTIONAL! If you're going to be booting Ubuntu, you can create a persistence file on the root of your USB to save changes. You can do that with the following commands (assuming that your USB is named usb and is mounted under /media/user... obviously, set these to the correct paths):\n\n dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/user/usb/casper-rw bs=1M count=128\n yes | mkfs.ext3 /media/user/usb/casper-rw\n\n\nThese commands create a 128 MB persistence file. You can change the size of the persistence file in megabytes by adjusting the count parameter. All values should be a power of two (e.g 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 ... 1024, 2056). Then, to activate persistence, when you boot your USB drive, select option 2 to go to the advanced options screen, highlight option 1 and make sure it activates, and then press 0 to boot the drive. You must repeat this process each time you wish to boot with persistence.\n\n\n\n*The \"instructions\" were written December 23, 2016... and there are a few things I notice which are different:  \n\n\n*\n\n*casper exists on the USB, is casper-rw where the persistent data gets written, or should I modify the command to casper?  \n\n\n*Presuming casper-rw, this throws an error:  \n$  dd if=/dev/zero of=/Volumes/UBUNTU/casper-rw bs=1M count=128\ndd: bs: illegal numeric value\n...to which man dd offers no clarification regarding block size numerical values, except this (from 1994):  \nWhere sizes are specified, a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal number of bytes\nis expected.  If the number ends with a ``b'', ``k'', ``m'', ``g'', or ``w'',\nthe number is multiplied by 512, 1024 (1K), 1048576 (1M), 1073741824 (1G)\nor the number of bytes in an integer, respectively.

Per the maker, \"The applesetos message is an oversight from me, but won’t affect the boot process.\" Similarly, with Master Boot Record I had to first create an admin account, and restart before system changes started taking hold.\n", "Q: No software update on my iPhone 4s Why doesn't my iPhone 4s have any iOS software updates available?

I'm developing a custom dictionary add-on to add to Mac's Dictionary.app. \nI would want my user to report dictionary add-on's errors or his/her comments (if any) to me as the developer. So far, I have been using the following AppleScript to send such reports to me using Mail.app.\ntell application \"Finder\"\nset current_path to (container of (path to me) as string) & \"VT_icon.icns\"\nend tell\n\ndisplay dialog \"Intro. to Dict Add-on.\" with title \"My Dictionary for Mac\" with icon file current_path buttons {\"Cancel\", \"OK\"} default button \"OK\" giving up after 500\n\nif the button returned of the result is \"OK\" then\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if not (exists application process \"Dictionary\") then\n        tell application \"Dictionary\" to activate           \n    end if      \n    set frontmost of process \"Dictionary\" to true\nend tell\n\ndelay 2\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set the clipboard to \"\"\n    keystroke tab\n    keystroke tab       \n    keystroke \"a\" using command down        \n    delay 1\n    keystroke \"c\" using command down\n    delay 1\n    set selected_text to (the clipboard as text)        \nend tell    \n\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set myMessage to make new outgoing message at the beginning of outgoing messages with properties {subject:\"Về: My Dictionary for Mac\"}      \n    tell myMessage to make new to recipient at beginning of to recipients with properties {address:\"myemail@hotmail.com\"}\n    set myMessage's content to \"My precoded message: \" & (the clipboard as text)                \n    set myMessage's visible to true\n    activate    \nend tell    \nend if\n\nSo far so good. The above script works flawlessly.

You won't be able to provide a mail template though (but you could prepare something in the clipboard and have the user paste it into the new mail), and it will fail for those users who don't use any mail client at all.\n\n*Create a web form on a web server of your choice and direct users to this site if they want to give feedback.\n\n*Collect user feedback within your application and just post it on your web server in the background.\n\n", "Q: How to capture the visible page screenshot in one step in Safari or another browser? I have a large series of web pages to capture for documentation.

If I were to do ssh host@IP, it would require me to enter the password in the second line.  I was thinking that I could do something like this: ssh host@IP | echo password, but that puts the password in before asking for the password.\n\nA: You should be using SSH keys to authenticate with rather than putting your password on the command line as it's extremely insecure.\nThe way this works is once you have your SSH keys set up, all you have to do is issue the command:\nssh user@host\n\nand without typing another thing, you will be automatically logged in.\n\nCopy SSH Public Key to Mac/FreeBSD/Linux from macOS\nThis assumes you have access to the remote server via password based authentication (typing in a password),  and that you have already generated your private/public keypair (if not, see below).  In the following example, we are using RSA.  To start with let's copy the key over (be aware that the \"home\" directory differs between macOS, Linux, BSD, etc.):\nUsing SCP:\nscp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@hostname:/Users/username/.ssh/\n\nOr simply cat-ing the file to authorized_keys (I prefer this method):\ncat id_rsa.pub | ssh username@hostname ' cat >>.ssh/authorized_keys'\n\n(Your key name may differ)  If the .ssh directory does not exist on the remote server you will need to login and create it.\nNow the key has been copied from the mac to the remote server.\nSet correct permissions for the SSH Public Key on the remote server:\nchmod 600  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nNext add the key to the SSH authorized_keys file, if the file does not exist create it.\nIf the file authorized_keys already exists in ~/.ssh the use the following command:\ncat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys\n\nIf the file does not exist enter the following commands:\ncat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys\n\nchmod 600 authorized_keys\nchown user:group authorized_keys\n\n\nGenerate SSH Public/Private key on macOS\nOpen up the Terminal by going to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal\nIn the terminal, use the following command to start the key generation\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nNext you will be prompted to provide the location where you want to create the private key file:\nEnter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):\nLeave this empty to create the key in the default location, which is /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa. The public key file will be created in the very same location, and with the same name, but with the .PUB extension.\nAfter you will be prompted to choose a passphrase. This is the password optional to use the private key.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\n\nYour SSH key is generated.\nNow, keep in mind, if you put in a passphrase you will be required to enter it each time you connect.  The utility ssh-agent will keep the passphrase in memory alleviating the need to manually enter it every time you connect while you are in the same session.  For more details see man ssh-agent\n\nA: I have spent a long time looking for the answer to this too. Despite it being insecure and all these people telling you to use RSA keys (which IS a more secure and reliable idea), it is quite possible. \nUse a program called expect for this. Expect will watch stdout (and I think stderr if configured correctly) for you, waiting for certain messages and responding to them with output. Expect itself is actually a scripting language, and when I was doing this same thing, I had a very hard time getting my own script to work properly because of timing. However, expect also includes a handy utility called autoexpect. \nWith autoexpect, it will watch you and generate an expect script for you. Simply run autoexpect and the command you want:\nautoexpect ssh host@ip \n\nand do what you'd normally do. When you exit the program (by typing exit in the ssh'd shell), it will generate the script. In case that you don't want the whole script you're writing to be in an expect script, you can edit the script from autoexpect (called script.exp) to exit before typing the exit command into the shell. The line you want to move to change the script ending is:\nexpect eof\n\nwhich means expect end of file. Hope this helps!\n\nA: There are several possibilities. Your example will obviously not work, but you can achieve something similar using sshpass utility:\nsshpass -p password ssh host@IP\n\nNote, this is not recommended because the password will be visible for other processes or in the shell history.\nA much better way to do the same is to set up the passwordless authentication using SSH keys. In short:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nssh-copy-id IP\n\n\nA: Using expect is just plain wrong to log into an ssh connection for anything other than in a test suite.\nWhat @ben-a is looking for is already implemented in ssh. The trick is to how to use it. So here goes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate a public/private keypair using ssh-keygen. Use either ECDSA or RSA as the -t (or type) and for RSA use 2048 or 4096 as the -b (or BITS length). This should suffice at the moment of writing. ALWAYS use a PASSWORD!\n\n*Utilize the ssh-copy-id or the above mentioned methodology to create on the machine you're logging on to (a.k.a. the server) the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. Within there is a copy of the public key you just generated.\n\n*Now on the machine you use to log into the 'server' (or client) you open the file ~/.ssh/config. If it does not exist you can create it.\n\n*In this file, you add the following for your needs\nhost <name you want to use for this connection>\n    Hostname <DNS or IP of the server>\n    user <user name you want to use>\n    identitiesonly yes\n    identityfile <path to the private key>\n\n\n*You can now use just ssh <name> to setup the connection, but it will still need the password for your key. To solve this, use the for-this-purpose developed and included ssh-agent. To add your key to the agent just use ssh-add <path to keyfile>. You will be asked for the password, and it will store the key for you securely for this session. If it yields the error \"can't find the ssh-agent\" (or similar), that means that probably the agent hasn't been started. You can start it for this session using ssh-agent bash. This will start a new shell with the agent active in it.\nWhen using these steps, you not only make it harder for someone to impersonate you by hijacking your credentials, but also keep the usability in order (its easier to use than plain passwords).\n\nA: Access the remote host and run bash script without checking host key and username password in one line.\nFirst install sshpass Debain:\n\nsudo apt-get install sshpass\n\nFor CenOS install form EPEL:\n\nyum --enablerepo=epel -y install sshpass\n\nCopy and paste in a file for example: remoteScript.sh\nAdd remote host details.\n\n#!/bin/bash\nPATH_TO_SCRIPT=\"/path/script.sh\"\nUserName=\"root\"\nHostName=\"192.168.01.11\"\nPassword=\"yourPassword\"\nsudo -S sshpass -p $Password ssh -o stricthostkeychecking=no $UserName@$HostName 'sudo -s ' < $PATH_TO_SCRIPT\n\nIf you want to use without bash script in terminal:\n\nsshpass -p Password ssh -o stricthostkeychecking=no root@192.168.11.22 'bash -s' < YourScript\n\nChange Password, User, and Server IP\n", "Q: View all times app was opened On macOS in the Finder, one can see when an app was last opened.\nBut suppose I have just opened the app and want to know the open history of the whole day, or of the past two days.

I am using Safari version 9.0.3 on Mac OS X El Capitan version 10.11.3.  I had dozens of Safari windows and tabs open when it became unresponsive.  In the past I could force quit and then the session would automatically restore at the next launch of Safari.

Now the last session windows are gone, and the history menu option to restore it is greyed out.\nIn an earlier version of the system a few years ago I used to manually restore Safari sessions by simply replacing the ~/Library/Safari/LastSession.plist file with a backup.  That is no longer working.  I have also tried restoring ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist and deleted the ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Safari.savedState folder since it did not exist before the issue; I might have caused creation of the folder by fiddling with the General pane System Preference setting to close all windows when quitting an app (I unchecked and checked it back on), and the Safari > Preferences... > General > Safari opens with: setting (changed from \"A new window\" to \"All windows from last session\" and then back again).

However, if your primary goal is to be able to adjust brightness or volume in a single move (without having to open the slider) there is an awesome shortcut to do this:\nTap the button and hold, then drag side-to-side.\nSo for example, to adjust audio you can tap and then drag side to side to get the audio level you want. Same trick works with brightness. For me this is as fast as the old hardware keys and still keeps the controls compact when you aren't using them!\n\nA: Definitely try out BetterTouchTool (BTT)! I've set up the app so that the volume can be adjusted when I slide the touch bar with 1 finger, the screen brightness can be adjusted when slide with 2 fingers, keyboard backlight can be adjusted when slide with 3 fingers. This way, I don't even have to look down and can start sliding anywhere I want on the touch bar. This also eliminates the tedious miss-triggering risk if you simply try to display the old fashion function keys. I hate that sometimes I have to light up the touch bar then use it. Setting up like what I described above also solves this issue. Everything can be adjusted without the need for lighting up the touch bar!\nIt does come with a price though, but I think it is well worth it!\n\nA: If you don't need the application-specific touch bar controls, you can configure it to always show the expanded control strip \n\nOtherwise, you could try configuring something in BetterTouchTool\n\nA: If you're interested in further customization of your Touch Bar, I'd recommend trying out BetterTouchTool (BTT).

But, if you were not making any modifications to your data at the time when you “unexpectedly” unplugged your drive, the data may not be affected, it’s just the file system is unrecognizable for your Mac temporarily since it could be broken when you unplugged your drive.\nHere’s the trick, it worked like a charm to me every time when I unexpectedly unplugged my drive without properly ejecting it:\ndiskutil list # to see the identifier of your drive\n# disk2s1 will be used in this example, replace it with your own drive identifier\nsudo fsck_exfat -y disk2s1\n\n", "Q: How to access icloud.com on Chrome for Android?

General/Accessibility\n2. Scroll down to Audio Volume Balance slider.\n3. Move it towards the ear piece that is NOT in your ear. \nI.e. if you have only the right ear piece in your ear, move the slider towards the left. This will reduce volume in the right ear BELOW the minimum that you can achieve with the regular volume control. Which proves it's possible and why on earth Apple doesn't allow you to lower both channels this way I don't know.\n4.

You can change it through that setting or to check if you think one piece is not working this will allow you to verify this, but it is NOT to lower the volume on ear pieces for that you need to press the volume buttons on your iphone or the bluetooth headsets themselves or find the \" Audio slider \" in the \" Audio streaming apps \" themselves.   To \" lower the minimum volume \" is based on personal preference. If changing the volume this way does not work then you may be facing a product quality issue in bluetooth headset because not all bluetooth headsets are created equally\n", "Q: Do I have to reinstall XQuartz every time I upgrade MacOS?

Most/all vents are near the hinge, away from the user. The fans blow air out of the case through those vents. If you ever open a Mac's laptop case, you will see each fan's circular inlet under the keyboard and its outlet channeled to a vent near the hinge. \nFor maximum cooling, the fans circulate air in-and-out the laptop. By basic physics (conservation of matter), the air leaving the case must be replaced with air entering the case. Each fan's inlet creates a slight vacuum to pull in air. That incoming air comes from the various holes: \n\n\n*\n\n*in the keyboard\n\n*various physical ports (USB, ethernet, audio line-in, headphone out);\n\n*optical drive slot; and\n\n*the Kensington security slat.\n\n\nThus, with the clamshell closed, the fans will work harder to pull air through the keyboard's holes. \nYou have also connected a USB keyboard. Plugging a keyboard connector into a USB slot will also slightly restrict airflow. Plugging in the keyboard will have a greater effect on airflow a closed clamshell because the top/display restricts airflow through the keyboard.\nBut, your laptop will work different circuits with the clamshell closed. Normally, closing the clamshell will turn-off the built-in video, so the circuits for the built-in video will shut-off. The laptop may also turn-on another different graphics processing unit [GPU] whenever the laptop connects an external monitor. For my Late-2011 MacBook Pro [MBP], simply connecting an external monitor, regardless whether the clamshell is closed, engages a separate high-performance dedicated/discrete GPU [dGPU]. Further, your external USB keyboard's switch matrix replaces your built-in keyboard's switch matrix.\nFor, some Macs, but perhaps not your MacBook, Energy Saver's preferences permit \"automatic graphics switching [AGS] between a standard/integrated graphics processing unit [GPU] and a high-performance dedicated/discrete GPU [dGPU],\" so \"your computer will automatically switch between graphics modes for better battery life.\" \n\nIn theory, the specialized high-performance dGPU more efficiently processes graphics information in the general CPU.\nAt least in OS X Sierra 10.12, Activity Monitor's Energy tab shows the active graphics processor as \"Graphics Card\" at the bottom of the window. \n\nThe Energy tab also shows whether each listed application requires the high performance GPU. \nTo lower temperature, I have checked AGS to prevent engaging my Late-2011 MBP's dGPU for low-level applications. For instance, Safari does not need the dGPU, but Opera, Chrome, and maybe Firefox can demand the dGPU.\nBy feel, my Late-2011 MBP, with an AMD Radeon HD 6770M dGPU mostly runs much hotter with automatic graphics switching while disconnected from the MagSafe adapter. Alas, that was before early November 2018 when I got real time temperature monitoring with the formerly-free Max Fan Control v. 1.4.2, so I do not have precise temperature measurements. (Also, connecting an external monitor automatically engages the Radeon HD 6770M dGPU and greatly increases its temperature before or while causing the dGPU to fail. In \"Radeongate\" Apple recalled a few years of MBPs for defective AMD Radeon dGPUs. A full discussion of \"Radeongate\" is for another time.)\nTech Tool Pro 9's Sensor Check also shows temperature data. But it only shows all sensor date, not just for the temperature sensors. Sensor Check does not continuously update the sensor data, so the user must repeatedly run sensor check. Micromat has issued Tech Tool Pro 10 in the past year.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Connecting to External Monitor I am wondering why my MacBook pro retina screen gets cut off from the sides while connecting an external monitor. My monitor is LCD 1280 x 1024 resolution connected via display port to VGA adapter. Other monitors I have used with same resolution do not give same issue. Other monitor I tried was bigger in screen size but same resolution. Please explain. I have attached image of what happens. \n\nA: From what I can see of your other monitor, it looks like you're in mirroring mode. Go to System Preferences > Displays > toggle \"Mirror Displays\", or press CmdF1 (maybe CmdFnF1).\n", "Q: How can I download macOS High Sierra's full installation file? I've installed the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility (.pkg file) from Apple Developer's official website. Upon completing installation, it opens the Mac App Store to the macOS High Sierra installation page automatically.\n\n\n\nUnder the 'Information' section, it's stated that the size of the installation file is 4.90 GB.\n\n\n\nHowever, when I downloaded it, it didn't download the full installation file. Instead, it's only 7.8 MB large.\n\n\n\nThe installation file looks the same as a usual one.\n\n\n\nSo,\n\n\n*\n\n*Why are some users getting the 4.90 GB file while others are getting the 7.8 MB file?\n\n*Is there any way to get the full 4.90 GB installation file?\nFyi, my Mac is currently running on macOS Sierra 10.12.3 (16D32).\nUpdate\nI appreciate the two answers that I've received and both can be reproduced. However, I'm not sure on why are some users getting the 4.90 GB file while others are getting the 7.8 MB file.\nThis thread from MacRumours suggests that it's something to do with the amount of disk space available on the Mac.\n\nA: For what it's worth: I have encountered a similar issue: a very small download file (14,5 MB), that launched automatically after a few seconds... tried it twice (both times the installation failed giving me some error about corrupted information on the server - I'm not sure what it meant but it might have been related to the fact that I was logged onto the MAS with a different account than the one I signed up for the public beta with). Anyway I just retried again and just on a whim before clicking download I pressed alt on the keyboard... now it's downloading the full thing.\nThis all happened in the space of 10 minutes.\n\nA: First you need to install High Sierra and then boot it. In High Sierra, open Safari and then open this URL to download the installer again:\nmacappstores://itunes.apple.com/app/id1209167288\nOnly when downloading from within High Sierra I get an installer that contains the installation files, when I download it in Sierra, my installer is also just about 8 MB, the installation files are downloaded only on install (no idea where the system is storing them during installation).\nBTW, if you want an installer medium, create a writable DMG with Disk Utility (6 GB of space is sufficient, make sure File System is MacOS Extended, not AFP, leave all other values default), quit Disk Utility (otherwise it will prevent certain kind of write access to that new volume), open Terminal app to get a terminal window and then run:\nsudo \"/Applications/Install macOS 10.13 Beta.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\"  --applicationpath \"/Applications/Install macOS 10.13\\ Beta.app\" --volume \"/Volumes/Untitled\"\n\nwhen prompted, enter your admin password. Here is the command again, just broken down for readability:\nINSTALLER=\"/Applications/Install macOS 10.13 Beta.app\"\nsudo                                          \\\n    \"$INSTALLER/Resources/createinstallmedia\" \\\n    --applicationpath \"$INSTALLER\"            \\\n    --volume \"/Volumes/Untitled\"\n\nWill take a while. Finally open Disk Utility again, select Images > Convert..., pick your disk image, choose a name and select Image Format to be CD/DVD Master. After the convert you have a disk image you can burn to get a real installer DVD that is also bootable.\n\nA: Download macOSDeveloperBetaAccessUtility.dmg. Then, in a VM try installing 10.13. After you agree to the Terms & Conditions let it download.\nDo not click restart. You will have the Installer in your /macOS\\ Install\\ Data/ directory.\n\nA: For others looking for this, it looks like the InstallESD.dmg-file ends up in /macOS Install Data/ when you start the actual install. So just let it finish downloading, copy the file and then cancel the install process. \n\nA: I had a similar problem installing the final release of High Sierra. I had macOS Sierra 10.12 and when I downloaded the install from App Store always It's only 19.9 MB.\n\n\n*\n\n*First remove the corrupted file from Applications/\n\n*I clean my caché with CleanMyMac.\n\n*I restart my Mac.\n\n*I open App Store and search for update and install a update's macOS Sierra with version 10.12.6.\n\n*Finally and after the restarts of the update I open App Store and downloaded High Sierra without problems.\n\n\nA: Your downloaded file seems to be corrupted or downloaded incompletely.\nSo, download it again see what'll happen, with opening this in Safari:\n\nmacappstores://itunes.apple.com/app/id1209167288\nI downloaded it and it's 5.26 GB, although it downloaded about 4.9 GB as App Store mentions (I think download file is compressed).\nAgain, I mention you that a few times I stopped the downloading with removing the installation app from launchpad and again I resume the downloading without any problems and it continues with the size that downloaded before.\n", "Q: Mac Pro 5.1 running very slow after fresh install I inherited a Mac Pro 5.1.\nI originally planned to use ubuntu on it. Which I did.\nBut I am now trying to get back to Mac OS X. Have installed the OS from the provided DVD. However it runs horribly slow. The boot would take 10 min. Every single click takes 30 sec to process.\nI feel like I have messed up something at the Apple hardware level. Fair enough, I think I deleted the recovery partition, and messed with boot partition for ubuntu to work.\nQuestion: is there any way to check the basics at the hardware level?\n  I have ran disk utility and disk check, nothing there improves. So I am thinking more MBR/Bios/etc.\nCheers\n\nA: After quite a bit of troubleshooting, I replaced the HDD with a new one. Works like a charm.\n", "Q: shortcut for cycling between different windows of Finder on Mac (not the tab)? I have macOSSierra 10.12.5, I have checked the keyboard shortcuts in system preferences and  Cmd ⌘   `   (command + backtick) is enabled indeed!\nYet, when I open two finder windows (not the tabs), I cannot cycle between them. I explicitly have to right click on the finder icon in the doc and select one of the open folders. This is bad, really bad for productivity, since I have to switch every time between mouse and keyboard.\nIs there a way out of this ?\nThanks\n\nA: Besides checking on System Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts that the shortcut is indeed active and enabled, check also on the \"Window\" menu on a Finder window. There should be the shortcut. In this case Command + `\".\n\nAs you've been suggested as well, check that your PHYSICAL keyboard has this key and doesn't require a modifier (like SHIFT) to be used. If you're using a foreign keyboard set, like a spanish or azerty keyboard, for example, you need to find out what the right key is.\nAnother idea would be to go to System Preferences / Keyboard / Input Sources and enable \"Show input in menubar\". You'll get a new menubar icon, from which you can select \"Show Keyboard Viewer\". In this tiny keyboard you can see where your keys are mapped. Maybe (just maybe) your tick (`) key is not where you think it is. This viewer should help you.\n\n", "Q: iCloud storage. What are the benefits of buying iCloud storage ? What's the point? What is it for? I bought some and I unfortunately thought it would give me more space for apps or photos but it still says I don't have storage so I guess not I just like to know what's the point of it what is it used for and if there are any other ways to free up space without deleting stuff. \n\nA: Apple's iCloud is just like any other cloud. It allows you store files, documents, pictures, etc.\nYou get 5GB free iCloud storage with Apple devices.\n", "Q: What's the shortcut for plus (adding) and minus (removing) by default In list elements inside System Preferences, I see a \"plus\" and a \"minus\" to add or remove elements (see photo below for example of Networking System Preferences). \n\nIn Windows these are usually associated with Insert / Delete or AltA / AltD. Is there keyboard shortcuts for these keys? I am trying to add keyboard shortcuts in preference without using a mouse but I have to rely on tab key to achieve this.\n\nA: Alt 0177 ±\nHold ALT key and type 0177 on keypad\nhttps://fsymbols.com/keyboard/windows/alt-codes/list/\n", "Q: What are the sharingd and sharedfilelistd processes? What are the sharingd and sharedfilelistd and why are they running?\n\nI'm on OSX El Capitan 10.11.6\n\nA: In a nutshell, sharedfileslistd is an XPC helper agent that provides SharedFilesLists private API in CoreServices that gets called by, for instance, by LaunchServices APIs and works with so-called SharedFilesLists - special property lists that contain NSURL BookmarkData entries. These are used for recent documents/servers/hosts that you see in Apple->Recent Items menu, Favourites/iCloud items/Bonjour hosts that appear in the Finder sidebar, Recent Documents in applications' Save/Open dialogs) and such.\nsharingd is sharing daemon that enables AirDrop, Handoff, Instant Hotspot, Shared Computers, and Remote Disc in the Finder. \n", "Q: How does APFS on macOS handle upper/lower case file names? So I recently learned here that HFS+ is case-insensitive but the APFS on iOS is case-sensitive. Is there a publically accessible documentation/reference which describes how APFS does handle upper/lower case file names on macOS? Or has somebody tried on Sierra already and can provide examples?\n\nA: \nAPFS has case-sensitive and case-insensitive variants. The\n  case-insensitive variant of APFS is normalization-preserving, but not\n  normalization-sensitive. The case-sensitive variant of APFS is both\n  normalization-preserving and normalization-sensitive. Filenames in\n  APFS are encoded in UTF-8 and aren’t normalized.\nThe first developer preview of APFS, made available in macOS Sierra in\n  June 2016, offered only the case-sensitive variant. In macOS 10.12.4,\n  the APFS developer preview was updated to also include a\n  case-insensitive variant. In iOS 10.3, the case-sensitive variant of\n  APFS is used.\n\nApple’s Developer FAQs\n\nA: Since many apps have not been updated to work with case sensitive file systems, Apple probably decided to do the upgrade with case insensitive by default. Hopefully as apps get updated the default in a future MacOS will change to be case sensitive.\n", "Q: Does restoring from Time Machine revert also the OS? I want to try updating my MacBook Pro 13\" (2013) from Mavericks to Sierra but I am afraid of performance issues. So I would like to be able to downgrade easily if I like.\nDoes a Time Machine backup allow to do this? I think that if this is the case I would have to restore the backup from the Recovery Mode, right?\nThank you\n\nA: I just attempted to do this with a 2013 air, Trying to use a Mojave Time machine backup after installing big-sur. It downgraded to Mojave.... bummer\n", "Q: Does customising MacBook Pro 13inch to 16GB RAM, i7 7th gen processor and 1TB SSD affect it's battery life? I would like to know whether customising MacBook Pro 13inch (2017 version) to \n\n\n*\n\n*16GB RAM\n\n*i7 7th gen processor\n\n*1TB SSD\n\n\nwould have any implications on it's performance, especially in terms of battery life.\n\nA: The only upgrade that may impact on your battery life is the processor upgrade. However, while some i7 CPUs are quad-core, the ones offered on the 13\" MBP are dual-core processors, just like the i5 CPUs.\nSince all dual core i5 and i7 mobile processors support hyper-threading, there's actually very little difference between them in terms of a performance gap and battery usage. In fact, both options for this model also incorporate the same Intel Iris Plus Graphics GPU. \nMy personal recommendation would be to go with the upgrade if you can afford it, as it will increase it's longevity in terms of future compatibility with software/hardware.\nIf you had to pick and choose what you upgraded, then the upgrade to 16GB RAM would be the most useful.\nFinally, you may want to know that Apple's battery testing for this model was conducted on the following configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5\n\n*1TB SSD\n\n*8GB RAM\n\n\nSource: Apple\n", "Q: Does Apple review apps while WWDC? 3 days ago I submitted app for review, and it still waits for apple's review. Now there is a WWDC in Cupertino. Is it mean that Apple stopped reviewing apps while conference?\n\nA: App Store reviews are continuing during WWDC.\nAccording to Average App Store Review Times, reviews are continuing during WWDC. The raw data page shows reviews completed during the last 24 hours, such as Stuart Cooper‏'s tweet.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2017 randomly restarts during sleep I have a new MBP 15 inch, 2017 w/touchbar (MacOS 10.12.5) and it restarts randomly during sleep.

What are the safest commands to use with rsync to copy from one hard drive, all its content to a new hard drive, both external through my Mac. \nThe important thing is I want to be sure permissions and privileges won't risk denying me access in the future if I try to access files on a different computer with a different user account for ex. \nIs rsync -a the answer ? Because I read it conserves permissions and privileges :/. \nThanks !\n\nA: rsync -a preserves permissions as far as your current computer/account is concerned. Accessing files from a different user/different account is controlled by a lot of parameters outside of rsync's influence (mainly by the access protocoll and its options used when mounting the drive).\n", "Q: What are these ports on a 20th anniversary Mac? Yesterday I found a Twentieth Anniversary Mac in my Nonna's basement. Apparently it's been there since 2002. I was very curious about this and I Googled it and found that it was a special edition.\nOn the rear and side are some ports I'm not familiar with. I wonder if anyone can explain them? \nThe rear has 6 ports and I don't know what ports 3, 4, and 5 are for? There's also a large port on the left hand side that I'm not familiar with.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: Wow, that's a find!\nActually, there are more than six ports on the rear, there's also a cover you can open to reveal a whole heap of other ports (e.g. Serial ports, ADB port, etc).\nHowever, to explain the ports in your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Port 3 is a SCSI port\n\n*Port 4 is a TV Tuner port\n\n*Port 5 is a FM radio port\n\n*the port on the left side you refer to is a PCI slot (Note there's actually a comm slot above this as well).\n\n\nBelow are some images I've taken from the Twentieth Anniversary Mac Service Source:\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThis model actually has a switch to select the appropriate voltage for your country (see below), so make sure you have the correct voltage selected for your location.\n\nIf your location is not listed, then select whichever is appropriate (e.g. if you're in Australia then select 230v).\n[EDIT]\nFinally, as per IconDaemon's comment below, you can access the service documentation directly for yourself.\n", "Q: 2010 MacBook Air Black Horizontal Line Across the Screen \nI have a 2010 MacBook Air with a black horizontal line across the screen. as shown in the photo below.   I don't know when it started; I just remember that I opened the lid today and saw it with the stripe. \nAs far as I know, it's not a GPU issue because connecting it to an external display does not show the problem. I've tried plugging and unplugging the display cable (no results), so I'm not sure if there's anything else I can do before I consider buying an used screen.\n\nA: It's most likely your LCD screen.   \nYour MBA has a single integrated GPU that's used for both your internal screen and to drive an external monitor.  The fact that it's not showing up on the external monitor narrows it down to the LCD screen.\nAdditionally, if this is happening prior to boot up of macOS, it's happening outside of the operating system so it's definitely a hardware issue.\nIt's possible to DIY replace the screen (Apple PN# 661-5732), but be aware that iFixit.com rates it as \"difficult\"\n", "Q: Iphone 5 stuck on 1,xxx,xxx,xxx seconds to unlock My Iphone 5 is stuck on X,xxx,xxx,xxx seconds to unlock, I done a hard reset (home + power for several seconds) but it doesn't doesn't work. \nWhat can I do?\n\nA: It looks like you entered wrong password/passcode many times resulting to a lockdown. You'll need to restore your iPhone using iTunes. Internet connection is needed. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Connect the iPhone to the computer\n\n*Turn off your iPhone then hold the Home button + Power button. The phone should go in the recovery mode (iTunes logo).\n\n*On iTunes, follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n\nFor more details on the procedure read If you forgot the passcode for your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, or your device is disabled on Apple's support site, especially the chapter titled Erase your device with recovery mode to remove your passcode.\n", "Q: Is there a way to schedule an iOS app to open at specific times? I was wondering if someone had any ideas on how (like the title says) I could schedule an app to open, say every hour.

Longtime Keynote user, and I'm starting to turn many of my Keynotes into movies that I can drop into Screenflow (a video editing app). I'm doing a lot of animated text instruction videos, and wondering if there's a way to create a keynote that has a clear transparent background, so that if I add other images into the Screenflow timeline, they can appear in the background of the Keynote movie. I'm pretty sure the answer is no, but I wanted to ask. Adding text into Screenflow is 10x slower than Keynote. Keynote really is the best text animator I've found for videos.\n\nA: Screenflow supports Chroma Key, to automatically remove the background of your video.\n\n\n*\n\n*In your Keynote presentation, open the Format inspector and choose Edit Master Slide.\n\n*For each master slide in use, set the slide background to green, then choose Done.\n\n\n*When you import your Keynote video into Screenflow, select the video and under Video Properties, add a Video Filter for Chroma Key.\n\n\n*\n\n*Screenflow - Using Chroma Key\n", "Q: Is there a Notification Center icon cache? Trying to change Apple app icons but they change to default app icon I have tried unsuccessfully to change the Apple system app icons (Mail, Messages, Reminders, etc) in LiteIcon on macOS Sierra 10.12. After applying the new icon, the Dock icon and the main icon seems to change, but the icon shown in Notifications does not (see images below).\nWhen I finish changing the icon in Liteicon, I select the menu item: 'Clear Icon Cache and Log Out.' Also, I have tried these commands in Terminal:\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \\;\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \\;\nsudo mv /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store com.apple.ic\n\n…and I have tried copying image content into 'Get Info' and I have tried replacing the app icon in 'APP.app'/Contents/Resources. Neither of these have worked.\nAny suggestions for clearing Notification Center icon cache, or what I may do so notifications display the correct icon?\n\n\n\n\nA: I found an answer to my issue using this AskDifferent post: Apps Icons not appearing.\nI think what finally solved the issue was:\n\n\n*\n\n*deleting ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist and then\n\n*Enter this command killall -KILL Dock\n\n*Restart Mac\n\n\nI hope this helps anyone who is having this or a similar issue.

Or even a regular vac if your careful.\n", "Q: Apple ball speakers connect to MacBookPro? Is there a way to connect my apple ball speakers to my MacBookPro? The speakers have a 2.5mm jack but the MacBook Pro has a USB port.\nThanks!\n\nA: You need a USB DAC (Digital Audio Converter).\nI personally use a Behringer UCA202 to connect my iMac to my Bose Wave Radio (line input).  \n\n\nWhat's really nice about it is that it's powered off the USB port meaning it doesn't need an external power adapter.  It also has both left and right inputs and outputs as well as a 3.5mm headphone connection.    For best quality, you will want to use the RCA output.  You will just need an RCA to 3.5mm adapter (second picture) to connect to your speakers.\n\nA: If your speakers have 2.5mm you'll need to buy 2.5mm -> 3.5mm adapter (like this) to connect it with MacBook Pro\n\nA: Do you mean the Apple \"Pro Speakers\" by Harmon Kardon? They have what looks like a standard 3.5mm (1/8inch) audio jack, but, unsurprisingly, the collar around the end makes it very difficult to plug into anything except the G4 'anglepoise' iMac they were designed for. \nAlso, if memory serves, they expect a higher output signal than is standard, so their audio 'profile' may not be optimal on other Macs.\n\n", "Q: How to make macbook pro use a 16:9 aspect ratio? How can I force my screen to use a 16:9 aspect ratio? I don't mind seeing black bars above and beneath the screen content.\n\nA: You can use RDM to set a custom resolution such as 1920×1080.\n", "Q: Can you add memory to the new 2017 iMacs that Apple announced on 5 June 2017? I know that earlier iMacs could be end-user upgraded to add more memory.  I was wondering if that is still the case with the models they announced yesterday, both for the 21\" and the 27\".\n\nA: The technical Specs mentioned for the 21\" Model no manual accessible Memory, contrary to the 27\" Model, see https://www.apple.com/uk/imac/specs/\nYou can Upgrade the Memory yourself only for the 27\" Model, the 21\" is onboard Memory (Build-to-Order).\n", "Q: Wiping a Macbook 2.1 clean So I am trying to wipe an old Macbook clean before giving it away to charity or recycling but I am having some issues. \nFor my PCs I have used DBAN successfully and I was hoping to use it here as well.\nBut Macbook refuses to boot from my DBAN Usb drive! When i restart and hold the \"alt\" button I get into the \"boot menu\" but I can only choose from my standard HD. Any suggestions?\n\nA: The old MacBook 2,1 (White 2008) could only boot from the CD/DVD drive.  Since you didn't mention that you could see the recovery partition (where you can access Disk Utility), we have to assume it's not there.\nIf you want to properly wipe it to ensure that all private data has been removed, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the HDD from the MacBook and connect to another computer via USB to SATA adapter\n\n*Wipe with DBAN or do a Secure Erase with Disk Utility\n\n*Reinstall OS X\n\n\nYou could try to \"hack\" together a solution to get your USB to boot with rEFInd, but the work to put in to get a USB drive bootable is (IMO) a large expenditure of time just to wipe a drive.\n\nA: Firstly you need to have your USB drive formatted to HFS+ or else the Mac won't be able to see it.\nYou can use this MacOS disk creator to create a USB drive to boot from or depending how old the Mac is if by 2,1 you mean the white plastic unibody MacBook then you can use Internet recovery on the by holding down CMD-R during startup. \nMake sure you're connected to the internet whilst doing so. \nYour Mac should boot to recovery mode where you can go ahead and wipe and re-install with a clean version.\n\nA: Use Lion Recovery Assistant or one of the many online guides to create USB macOS media. Then boot off of that media and wipe the system from there.\n", "Q: Can using Little Snitch make my mac Less Secure than its \"out of the box\" settings? Short Question\nIm thinking about configuring little snitch to allow all processes incoming and outgoing network traffic. \nBy allowing \"any process” incoming / outgoing rights will this make my Mac less secure than its default settings (default out of the box, eg. not using OSX’s in built firewall tool)\nLonger Question with background\nThe reason i want to do the above is because i want to block incoming and outgoing network traffic for a few applications. I can do this no problem with Little Snitch, but if i turn Little Snitch on it will by default block all network traffic and require each connection to be manually approved. To get around this i would setup the \"allow any process\" incoming and outgoing traffic rights. \nThis way all incoming / outgoing is allowed as a global rule, but certain apps are blocked as a specific rule. \nWould doing the above make my Mac less secure than its default settings (default out of the box, eg. not using OSX’s in built firewall tool)\n\nA: Little Snitch can work alongside macOS firewall. If a connection is permitted by Little Snitch, but is still blocked in the macOS firewall, it'll still be blocked. Little Snitch doesn't bypass the macOS firewall, so Little Snitch can't lower the security when the macOS firewall is still enabled.\n", "Q: How can you delete pics on your phone (while on computer) before syncing? Whenever I go to sync my photos to my computer I see all \"pocket photos\", screenshots no longer needed, and duplicate shots I'd prefer to delete.  However I can't do this from my computer where it would be sooooo much easier.  This is not just because of the UX, but also because you can see the images larger.  \nI don't want to waste double the space on my phone and computer and have to do double work.  I also don't want to spend my time crouched over my phone inspecting and slowly poking with my finger when I have a full screen, keyboard and mouse interface at my disposal.\n[Aside: The conspiracy theorist/negative karma in me believes apple sets this up intentionally so you run out of space faster and need to buy icloud storage or devices with larger and larger storage the next time around.]\n\nA: Use Image Capture in the Applications folder. Connect your device and choose it from the sidebar, then select the photos you wish to delete and click the  icon at the bottom.\nYou can switch the view from list to thumbnails at the bottom too and increase the size of the thumbnails using the slider. Use ⇧-click and ⌘-click as usual to select multiple photos for batch deletion.\n\nA: I've had this problem for a while too, and finally after trying out a bunch of solutions I came to the conclusion that I need to turn off \"My Photo Stream\" on the Photos app on the Mac, but leave it on in my iOS devices.\nSo the workflow will be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off My Photo Stream on macOS\n\n*Take photos on iPhone\n\n*Edit photos on iPhone\n\n*Connect iPhone to Mac and open Photos and import all the new photos, tick \"Delete after importing\" if you wish.\n\n*Now the Photos on your Mac will only contain the filtered and edited photos. \n\n\nThis is because the way it works on iOS is that the \"My Photo Stream\" section there is separated from the main library, however, in macOS \"My Photo Stream\" is immediately imported, therefore you'll have to do double the work if you turn this on.\nIf anyone else found a better solution, I'd love to hear it, but I think this is what Apple intended to do. \n", "Q: Can I connect any Thunderbolt 1/2 device to a Thunderbolt 3 adapter? I have a few Thunderbolt 1/2 devices (eSata connectors, DVI/HDMI connectors, etc.) I still have an older device that uses these connectors. Now I'm using a new MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 3. I noticed that there is a Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter at the Apple store. \nWill it work with any devices? \nI don't want to spend money on a adapter that may not fit my needs, and I don't want to buy all the adapters again for the new format USB-C / Thunderbolt 3. ☺️\n\nA: Yes, you can use the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter to connect your Thunderbolt 2/1 devices to your new MacBook Pro.\nFrom Apple's webpage:\n\nThe Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter lets you connect\n  Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 devices — such as external hard drives\n  and Thunderbolt docks — to any of the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports on\n  your MacBook Pro.\n\n", "Q: How to install and virtualize Windows 10 from USB stick? I have a bootable Windows 10 USB that I bought at Best Buy. Is there any way to install and virtualize it on my Mac?  \n\nA: Using Parallels Desktop you can import bootable disks as virtual disks. Choose File → New, select existing disk, then choose USB Drive and follow the instructions.\n\n", "Q: Getting 3 beeps on restart after RAM install... is the RAM really bad? I have a 2009 iMac and wanted to bump up the RAM to it's max capacity. \nI did a quick search and found that it is supposed to handle 8GB. I Bought 2 4GB sticks from Crucial (supposedly a good brand) and installed them according to the instructions. \nOn restart, I got 3 beeps which is supposed to mean that the RAM is bad. I tested various configs of the old RAM with the new RAM and am able to use either of the old 2GB sticks and either of the new 4GB sticks with no issues but can't put 2 new 4GB sticks or even 1 4GB stick by itself. \nIt has to have an old stick in to be able to boot. When it boots the RAM shows as 6GB and seems to have no issues. So what's the deal and how common is it that the RAM is \"just bad\" and has to be exchanged? (See attached images for clarification)\n\n\n\nA: Your comment of \"supposed to handle\" is key here. Apple supports up to a specific amount of RAM in upgradable Macs. Now guessing Apple's motivations is generally discouraged here (and celebrated elsewhere...), it is not a stretch to extrapolate why.\nThe \"supposed to handle\" comes from at least one person reporting that more than the supported amount of RAM worked fine on their Mac. In some models perhaps a lot more than one. So putting more RAM in a system that will reportedly work with more than officially supported is not much more than \"my cousin Jane put more than the supported amount of RAM in her 2009 iMac and it worked fine.\"\nApple likely did not set the maximum RAM supported arbitrarily. There are likely technical reasons why certain Macs only support up to a certain amount of RAM. And you are one of the 'lucky' few experiencing an edge case where manufacturing tolerances have conspired to make your iMac one of the unlucky few that don't support more than Apple's Officially Supported specification.\nIn this particular case there are two possibilities. One, that your particular iMac does not support the amount of RAM you wish to install, PERIOD. Or two, that the RAM Crucial has provided you is defective in some way (doubtful from your testing scenario) or just incompatible with your particular iMac. And perhaps another manufacturers RAM would work fine.\nPersonally I would go with number one. But if you have more fortitude than I you could try exchanging the RAM or getting a refund and trying another brand.\n", "Q: What sources of funds can be used for peer-to-peer Apple Pay? Peer-to-peer Apple Pay was announced during the 2017 WWDC keynote.\nHow does the money enter your Apple Pay account in the first place?\n\n\n*\n\n*Does it come from a linked credit card, as in how Apple Pay traditionally  works?  If so, would the transaction be considered a cash advance or a purchase by the credit card company?\n\n*Does it come from a linked bank account or a linked debit card?  If so, does that mean giving Apple a pre-authorization to withdraw money from your bank account?  Also, is there an imposed or customizable limit to how much money can be withdrawn?\n\n*Do you buy credits to be added to your Apple Pay account using gift cards, at a convenience store or at an Apple Store?\n\n\nA: Apple Pay Cash is being introduced in the US first, with iOS 11.2 and watchOS 4.2 betas.  Both parties in a peer-to-peer transaction must have a suitable version of the software and have signed up for Apple Pay Cash.\nCash can be sent from a linked credit card (which incurs a 3% fee) or debit card.\nReceived cash is stored in an Apple Pay Cash card in Wallet.  It can be used for purchases or sent to a bank account.\n", "Q: My Macbook Pro gives electric shocks. How can i measure it? I'm getting electric shocks/strong tingling sensation with my Macbook Pro whenever the power chord is plugged. It happens all the time, anywhere, and is unrelated to wearing shoes or not. It's disturbing enough to prevent normal use, and really makes me wonder if it is a health hazard (what's the limit again for DC, 30 milliamps before you're history?).\nI tried measuring it with a multimeter. I got some readings at 18V (quite typical of a charger voltage).\nI'm unhappy with this, and the net is littered with people complaining about this same problem. \nHow can I properly measure the voltage?  What do regulations say?\n\nA: you already answered your first question. as for your second that depends on what regulation you are talking about. I could tell you what is causing it but you didnt ask that \n", "Q: How can I avoid that my wife’s iPad sounds an alarm every time I add an event to a shared calendar in iCal? I share my work calendar on iCal with my wife (synced with iCloud). Every time I add an event to that calendar, my wife’s iPad plays a sound. Because I live in Europe but work for a company in the US, this often happens in the middle of the night for us, and the pings wake her up.\nIs there a way to disable these sound notifications on her iPad?\n\nA: This can be done in the Notifications settings.\nHow to adjust notifications for iOS Calendar\nOn the iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Select Notifications\n\n*Select Calendar\n\n*Select Shared Calendar Changes\n\n*Select Sounds\n\n*Select None\nOne can also adjust several other types of notifications as well or even completely disable notifications for the Calendar app.\nAnother setting to look at is Do Not Disturb\nThis can be set manually or on a schedule.\nFrom the settings:\n\nWhen Do Not Disturb is enabled, a moon icon will appear in the status bar and incoming FaceTime calls and alerts will be silenced.\n\n", "Q: How to diagnose insertion point/trackpad jitters? When I’m typing in any application (e.g. Chrome, Safari, MS Word, Evernote), the insertion point often jumps around unexpectedly. I have this problem with the builtin trackpad and my magic trackpad at home. Caveat Since this is both a disease of the internal trackpad and the magic trackpad then it can't be the cable between the internal trackpad and the motherboard\nMy MBP has been for service once, I believe they changed a cable between the trackpad and motherboard. No dice. I have wiped the OS and reinstalled from scratch. I have booted in safe mode. You get the idea. I'm certain that most of the time I'm nowhere near the trackpad when it happens. (Like 10 seconds ago).\nIs this hardware? Software? I must admit I don’t have a clue how to diagnose. My leaning is likely software.\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\nOS 10.12.5 (although this has been going on for over a year)\n\nA: I'm sure you've read Apple's support documentation on this issue by now and have had no luck.\nSince the issue wasn't resolved even after reinstalling macOS from scratch and booting into safe mode, this should definitely be a hardware problem. Your trackpad is slowly dying. The connector is probably loose or getting old. Since you say that the trackpad cable has already been changed once, it probably wasn't serviced properly the first time.\nThe best thing to do here would be to go back to an Apple service center and get your laptop checked again. That's almost always the best route to take in case of hardware problems with Apple products.\nFYI: There are people who've said that a firm slap with the palm of their hand fixed their trackpad issues. Try at your own risk though.\n\nA: This is a problem that appeared when Sierra was new, and it rendered my MacCook Pro unusable. Weary of trying fix after fix from the web, I finally did an Internet Reinstall...and when that didn't work, did a second.\nResult: fixed. \nOne could also do a clean IR, bet that would be even faster.\nAstonished to discover this problem had been around in previous OS versions. \nBut I do know the \"fix\".\n", "Q: After the Update System is still showing the Old OS After the Update System is still showing the Old OS check the screenshot\n \nand if i click on the system update there is no os update just some other updates.check the screenshot\nplease help me out \n\nA: This happens to me occasionally—after installing the latest update my iMac reboots and it’s still running its previous version.

I attached a 5 TB external via USB to store the encrypted sparse bundles.\nIt is working splendidly for my early-2015 MacBook Pro running Sierra.  Unfortunately I cannot seem to get my girlfriend’s mid-2009 MacBook Pro running El Capitan to backup to paleophile.  (Her computer cannot be upgraded to Sierra.)\nOur LAN is handled by an Apple Airport Extreme (the flat one) to which paleophile is connected by ethernet.  Both my laptop and hers generally connect to the network via WiFi.  I have also tested her backup setup over ethernet with WiFi turned off; unfortunately with the same results.\nI have setup one account on the server for each of our laptops.  Thus her's connects to the server through a different account than mine.  Please note that those accounts were setup at the same time and in the same manner so I would expect that they would be identical in configuration.  The motivation for these separate accounts was to take advantage of the capacity to apply a disk usage ceiling, particularly on myself.\nThe error message my girlfriend’s computer reports is that the username and password are incorrect. \n \nOf course I have checked them.  To be precise I mounted the server, logging in as the same user with the same password and then mounting the already existing encrypted backup with the key.  That all worked perfectly.\nAnother difference between her laptop and mine that may be relevant is that if I look in 'Keychain Access' for keys related to paleophile I see the following...   on my laptop:\npaleophile._smb._tcp.local.              Time Machine Password\n\nwhile on hers the quite distinct key appears \npaleophile._afpovertcp._tcp.local.       Time Machine Password\n\nSo it appears that our two machines are attempting to use different protocols to communicate with the server.  Is this because my laptop is running Sierra and hers is running El Capitan?\n\nUsing the information provided by correspondents in the comments below I examined the configuration of the my Time Machine server.  It is setup to accept both AFP and SMB connections for my girlfriend's account.  Here is a screenshot of that config panel.\n\nIt appears that the TM server is at least configured to accept AFP connections, even if it is failing to do so.  \n\nThe error message that appears in her Console.app when I try to trigger a backup is\n6/6/17 7:33:39.244 PM   Finder[239] _CSBackupServerProxyCopyMountPointForDestination returned result code: 29\n\nI've done my best to Google error code 29, but have been unable to find any useful information.

The issue was that her sparse bundle was corrupted.  \nI deleted her account and her sparse bundle (I now believe deleting her account was excessive) and started her over from scratch with a fresh account and sparse bundle.  That solved the problem.\nThis solution was discovered when a Mac Guru friend of mine suggested that I try backing her computer up to the server by letting her computer use my computer's credentials.  Her computer immediately began backing up successfully.  That was a big clue as to what was wrong.\n", "Q: Kernel panic or logic board? I was recently given an iMac (24-inch Early 2008) without a hard drive. Following the instructions on iFixit, I gave the computer a hard drive, installed Mavericks on it, and didn't notice anything damaged/broken.\nThe computer worked really well a few times, then began not starting up properly. \nDisk Utility didn't report anything wrong.\nNevertheless, it would either start properly, then work for a while and shut down (or not), stay stuck on the startup chime, the screen would remain blank at startup, or display typical kernel panic messages such as:\n\nI reset SRC, same problem. When trying to start Apple Hardware Test (starting up with D key pressed), the screen would remain black and a sound would be heard \"du-du-du-du-du\" until I force it to shut down.\nAfter finding articles about similar issues, I opened the RAM trap and removed the two 2GB bars of RAM that were inside:\n\nSince then, when I try to start it up, the screen remains black and I hear a sound every second which is not the startup chime. \nIs this a kernel panic problem or a logic board problem?\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you've now removed the two 2GB RAM modules and now when you try to start up your iMac, the screen remains black and you hear a sound every second?\nThis model iMac only has two RAM slots, and since you've removed both modules, it now has no RAM at all. As a minimum, Mavericks requires 2GB RAM installed.\nAs a starting point, I would re-insert one of the modules into the first slot and try running the iMac to see how you go. If the problems return, swap the modules and test again.\nIf you get no joy from the above, then try it again with the second slot.\nEither way, let me know how you go.\n", "Q: Is there a way to delete an app of an iPad that used the same Apple ID without touching it? My relative yelled at me for downloading an app for my friend now I have to delete it but there's no way I can ask my friend if she could delete the app and look for someone else to download it for her (Minecraft). I can't take her iPad and delete it so how can I delet it without touching the iPad. Is there a way? Mine is iPad Pro, hers is iPad Air 2.\n\nA: It's bought & paid for - you own it forever, you can't send it back.\nIf you can't physically delete it from your friend's iPad, then there's no way to remove it. They won't ever be able to update it without knowing your Apple ID log & pass, but it will remain until they choose to delete it.\nRemoving it from any/all other devices will not affect that one.\n", "Q: How to install a specific version/build of Safari? A customer has reported a bug in Safari 10.1.1 (11603.2.5) which I cannot reproduce in Safari 10.1.1 (12603.2.4) on macOS Sierra.\nEverything is updated in the App Store.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to install a specific build number of Safari?\n\n*If not, what accounts for the different builds on different machines?\n\n*Are there release notes available at the level of build numbers?\n\nA: I do not think you can find level of builds for Safari. As long as you are running the current latest version of Sierra, You will have the latest version of Safari.\nTo find the latest updated version and patch details you can track them on Apple Support.\nThe last updated for Safari came on 15 May 2017 - Safari 10.1.1\nSupported OSes - OS X Yosemite 10.10.5, OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, and macOS Sierra 10.12.5 \n\nA: I frequently had the same issue. I always ask the customer to include the App bundle (his build) with the bug report together with a screen video of the problem (Quicktime) and this works quite nicely in 99% of all cases.\nAfaik, there's no other way to get a specific build. If Apple would allow you to do this, is would be great though.\nMake sure to run the same version of OSX to reproduce the problem. I have the latest 2 or 3 versions installed in parallel on my Mac.\n\nA: Each build is for a different OS version, so you cannot install the other build on another OS version.\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari 10.1.1 (11603.2.5) is for OS X El Capitan (10.11)\n\n*Safari 10.1.1 (12603.2.4) is for macOS Sierra (10.12)\n", "Q: Remove auto suggestion for usernames \nHow do I remove this function?\n\nA: It's up to the website to disable autocorrect on fields. You can disable autocorrect globally: go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Text and uncheck ‘Correct spelling automatically’.\nInstead of disabling it, you can click the × to cancel that correction, and once you've done that a few times, the word will be added to the dictionary and won't be autocorrected.\n", "Q: Is there any way to put iMac to sleep (or other low power mode) while using it in target display mode? When I connect to my mid-2010 27\" iMac in Target Display Mode, fans hum and hard disks spin (with occasional I/O). Being logged out in iMac's macOS doesn't help.\nIs it possible to lower this unnecessary power drag or at least minimize the noise? Can I boot iMac as a dumb-display?\n\nA: No, you cannot go into low power mode while in Target Display mode.\nWhile your iMac is \"acting\" as a \"passthrough\" for you display signals you are not bypassing the logic board and GPU to connect to the display.  The iMac display is still connected to the internal logic board and GPU and that GPU is required to display images on the screen.\nThe fans are coming on because the SMC in the iMac has calculated (based on input from the temp sensors) that it has reached a certain temperature threshold and it needs to cool down.  Remember, your GPU and logic board is hard at work taking DispayPort and/or Thunderbolt input and converting it to displayable graphics.\nIf you want a \"dumb\" monitor, the best option is to get a dumb monitor.\n", "Q: How do I change which AirPod audio input comes from? My AirPods are suddenly not working for audio input and I remember there was a way to force the OS to use the left or right one but I don't remember whether it was iOS or macOS. Sound Preferences on the macOS doesn't seem to give me the option.\n\nA: Sorry - just found it in iOS. You go to Bluetooth, select the (i) info icon to the right of the AirPods and then at the bottom is a Microphone options: Automatically Switch AirPods or Always Left/Right AirPod.\n", "Q: Text replacement not working in Office? I am talking about the text replacement function under system prefs/keyboard/text.\nI have added multiple replacements, but they don't work in MS Office (Word, Excel, etc). Anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: Word does not use apple's stuff for this, you set it up in word's own Tools > Autocorrect .\n\nA: In Outlook, make sure that \"Text Replacement\" is active.\n\n", "Q: Stocks app added stocks overnight I use the iOS Stocks app to track different securities.  Yesterday I had only four securities listed, yet somehow overnight six additional securities were added. Those additional six securities were tracked in the past, months ago.  \nHow can I tell if the app store past data in the cloud?\n\nA: Ok, it happened again, but this time I know why. I recently did a clean install of macOS Sierra on my computer. macOS Sierra has a Notification Center and a Stocks widget.  This is linked using iCloud to my iPhone's Stocks widget in its Notification Center.\n", "Q: Trackpad and Keyboard malfunctioning I have a MacBook Pro Early 2011 (now vintage) running macOS Sierra without any problem whatsoever. However, my trackpad sometimes (very frequently) starts to malfunction or stops to function at all.\nI am using an external mice without problems. On the keyboard, sometimes [it] starts malfunctioning when I type really fast which I believe it's correlated with the Trackpad issue.\nThings I already did:\n- Fresh install\n- New Battery\n- Reset NPRAM\n- Ran Apple Hardware Test no issues shown.\nTheories:\n- Some electrical charge probably messed up my trackpad and Apple Hardware Test is not showing it (however sometimes trackpad works perfectly fine).\n\n\n*\n\n*My MacBook has a small dent so the bottom case is not completely closed, could it be that is getting dust, debris or even some weird electrical issue?\n\n*On the inside, the Trackpad and Keyboard Cable usually contains this bracket (see pic below) however my my MacBook doesn't have it. Could that be an issue? \nNext Steps:\nI'm looking for some theories as well in here before I actually buy extra pieces as I'm on a budget. Replacing the bottom case with keyboard and trackpad seems to be the safest choice but the most expensive and the bracket seems like the cheapest and quicker way.\nPlease any help is appreciated!\n\n\nA: After much research it turns out it was not the bracket itself. Although I have to tell that the keyboard behaved better after installing the bracket.\nI had to replace my trackpad entirely after all so probably something messed up my trackpad or just regular lifecycle (my MBP is 6 years old now...)\n", "Q: Installing Windows 10 from an ISO Image on my new 15 inch MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch bar Recently I've bought a new 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch bar and I tried to install windows 10 using an ISO image and bootcamp. Everything was going well until I got the following error in my laptop's boot area within the Windows 10 installation environment:\n\nWindows cannot locate the disk and partition specified in the unattend answer file's <ImageInstall> setting.\nI know that Editing the XML file for the answer system can solve the problem, but how? As you know in this version of MacBook Pro no USB stick is used to install Windows and I cannot find where macOS stores the files created by bootcamp for installing windows.\nPlease help me fix this issue.\n\nA: You don't need to do such sophisticated thing. All you need to do is:\nAfter making a second partition for windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Provide an external super drive and insert the DVD of windows 10 inside it.\n\n*You will find out that your trackpad and keyboard are not functioning in the following steps of windows 10 installation.\n\n*Therefore you should use a mouse (I prefer wired mouse) and an external keyboard.\n\n*Finally when the installation finished, download bootcamp separately from apple and install it then you'll see that all of the features of you MacBook Pro are greatly working such as trackpad, keyboard, bluetooth, graphic and etc.\n\nA: If the ISO file you’re trying to install is on an external drive, moving it to built in memory and retrying might help. Because it seems Windows do not have permissions to access external drives and hence can’t proceed with the ISO at that stage.\n", "Q: My iPad mini 2 won't update. My iPad mini 2 won't update. It is stuck on 9.3.5 Is it because my iPad is too old? Also, when I look at my storage stuff, the update isn't even there. \n\nA: No, the iPad Mini 2 is eligible for an upgrade to iOS 10.\nHave you tried upgrading via iTunes? It could be that your device doesn't have enough storage and is failing to update because of it.\nIf that doesn't work, you can make a back-up (either by connecting your iPad to iTunes, or backing up to iCloud), and then restore the iPad. Just connect your iPad to iTunes, go to 'summary' and then click 'restore'. \n", "Q: Dock freezing and right click and expose doesn't work I don't know why, but there are some very strange problems with my system. At times, the right click will stop working on both the mouse and trackpad, only ctrl+click will work.\nAt the same time when pointing the mouse in the corner, it doesn't respond well. If I move the mouse over an icon in the dock, The dock will freeze, with the app icon stay \"magnified\". If I move the pointer over the dock, that icon stay larger.\nI can click on any other icon, that don't move ( enlarge ) as usual and the app can be open.\nI figured the only solution is to reinstall Sierra. (But, wait for it...)\nI try to come back with Time Machine...nothing.\nDisk Utility...nothing.\nBitdefender Virus and Malware scan...nothing.\nI've tried to reinstall the MacOS but after two days the problem appears again.\nI've tried to not use some applications in the background, but until now I can't understand if some of that cause the problem.\nWhat can I do to determine and understand if there are some app that is causing the problem or if it's just my settings and data reacting badly with the code and system?\n\nA: Found this in SuperUser:\n\nIt looks like your dock has died. If you can get into Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal, I think), try sudo killall Dock. This'll crash-close the Dock, and it should restart happily. If it doesn't, logout and back in again.\n\n", "Q: iBooks and Notes crashing on startup I installed the iOS 11 Beta, then downgraded back to iOS 10.3.2.

It seems like xargs is removing spaces. Example\n$ echo \"foo  bar\" | xargs -I {} echo \"{}\"\nfoo bar\n\nNotice there's only 1 space between foo and bar but 2 were passed in. The example above works in Ubuntu 16.04 bash\nNote I'm actually trying to process a list of files as in\ncat list-of-files | xargs -I {} echo \"{}\"\n\n-O doesn't work in this case as xargs sees the entire file as one filename.  Tried -E '\\n' but that still ate the extra space\n\nA: Here are 3 possibilities that may work for you:\n1. BSD xargs\nThis is built in to MacOS, but will require you to quote the filenames in your list-of-files\n$ more list-of-files\n'file1'\n'file2'\n'file 3'\n'file  4'\n\nnote: I added the -t option in order to show the generated command before it executes.\n$ cat list-of-files | xargs -t -I {} echo \"{}\"\necho file1\nfile1\necho file2\nfile2\necho file 3\nfile 3\necho file  4\nfile  4\n\n2. GNU xargs\nGNU xargs is not installed on MacOS by default, but can be installed via homebrew (in the findutils package).\nbrew install findutils\nUsing GNU xargs via homebrew would not require you to quote the filenames, and would give the same result as using BSD xargs, and quoting the filenames (option 1, above).\n3. find (instead of list-of-files)\nRather than using a file for your input, use the find command. Something like the following should work:\n$ ls -laF file*\n-rw-r--r--  1 sfederman  staff  0 Jun  7 22:53 file  4\n-rw-r--r--  1 sfederman  staff  0 Jun  7 22:53 file 3\n-rw-r--r--  1 sfederman  staff  0 Jun  7 22:53 file1\n-rw-r--r--  1 sfederman  staff  0 Jun  7 22:53 file2\n\n$ find . -name \"file*\" | xargs -0 -I {} echo \"{}\"\n./file  4\n./file 3\n./file1\n./file2\n\nOr, avoiding xargs completely:\n$ find . -name \"file*\" -exec echo \"{}\" \\;\n./file  4\n./file1\n./file2\n./file 3\n\n\nA: Here's a work around for your issue using sed to wrap each line of the file with double quotes.\nsed 's/\\(.*\\)/\"\\1\"/' < list-of-files | xargs -I {} echo {}\n\nThis also works with GNU xargs.\n", "Q: Changed premissions in home folders and computer won't boot I thought would be a good idea to run chmod o-w,o-r,o-x in my home folder and /var/root.\nAfter doing that, programs were unable to start properly, saying they couldn't write to /var/folders. I moved folders to folders 2, but no joy. I ran chmod -R 755 in both folders and things were kind of fixed, but programs couldn't access the keychain. I restored back the original /var/folders, but now all I get is the Apple loading bar stuck at boot and can't boot to safe mode. macOS Sierra, SIP disabled.\n\nA: Boot to Recovery HD, choose Utilities → Terminal, run resetpassword and choose to reset permissions and ACLs for your user account.\nIf that doesn't work, you may have to reinstall macOS. SIP protects the permissions on OS files, so disabling that will allow you to run commands which break the OS.\n", "Q: Mac, automation of itunes searches of a list of words?

There is another admin account that was setup when this computer was imaged, but that account shouldn't own my keychain, right?!\nI tried looking for Keychain First Aid but apparently that's been removed.\nI'm running 10.12.4.\nAny ideas of what's going on and/or how to fix it?\n\nA: I was able to fix this issue by restarting my computer in recovery mode and using disk utility's First Aid to repair all volumes and the disk itself. I don't know which repair actually fixed the issue, but when I restarted I was able to view and save items in my keychain. \nYou can enter recovery mode by restarting your computer and holding down the keys command and r. Once you're in recovery mode you can select \"Disk Utility\" to get to the First Aid tool. \n \nOnce you're here you can click on each of the volumes (the indented names on the left. E.g. Macintosh HD) and then click the First Aid button. \nI repaired both of my volumes and the disk itself (the APPLE SSD SM...). The first aids for the volumes and the disk itself do different things. \nAfter you're done, restart your computer and try to use/view your keychain. Cross your fingers and hope you don't have to do more googling!\n\nA: Running Disk Util also fixed this exact same problem for me. I have 10.12.6 that was working fine, until I came in to work one morning and suddenly nothing worked - Box and several other services kept demanding authentication and failing, claiming they could not access keychain. Trying to reset keychain resulted in same problems shown above in this post. Surprisingly, Disk Utility fixed it all.\n", "Q: iOS and Gmail Notes Syncing Issue I have a iPad and iPhone, both of which are having severe Gmail Notes syncing issues.\nMy setup was working fine for the last several years, but recently (starting about a month and a half ago), my Notes randomly stop syncing between the devices and Google.\nThe notes will be locally updated on the particular iDevice I used last, but never sync up to Gmail (verified by looking in my account on a web browser), and therefore never sync to my other iDevice. This causes out-of-sync Notes, and is a pain to get working again. When I do get it working again, it only works for a handful of days (2-5 days), and then suddenly stops syncing again for no obvious reason.\nI only use Gmail for Notes - I have all other Gmail syncing turned off in the iOS settings (as has been for at least the last year and a half without issue). I use Office 365 for Mail, Contacts, and Calendars. My Gmail Notes integration was legacy, but I preferred how it worked over the Office 365's OneNote setup.\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turned off Note syncing (which deletes the notes from the Device), and then turning it back on. This does not seem to have any effect, and the Gmail notes section under the Notes app never shows back up. It's like it's still not enabled.\n\n*Deleting the Gmail account off the iDevice entirely, and then re-adding the Gmail account and turning everything off except Notes syncing. This works for a few days, and then suddenly stops again.\n\n*Tried doing a Network Settings Reset on both iDevices. This has no effect.\n\n*Tried updating my iDevices from 10.3.1 -> 10.3.2 hoping there was some issue/bug in the Notes app from Apple... but this had no effect, even after repeating the above things.\n\n\nOddly enough, when I go into Settings and enable Gmail Email syncing, the notes seem to start to sync again. The problem here is I forward all email to my Office 365 account, so I don't want to sync my Gmail Mail to the iDevices. My password for Gmail has not changed recently, and deleting/re-adding the account to iOS would confirm if I've entered the wrong password anyway.\nMy Devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 6 on iOS 10.3.2\n\n*iPad 4 on iOS 10.3.2\n\n\nHow can I make my iDevices cooperate with Gmail Notes like they used to?\n\nA: My iPad updates right away if I add or edit a note in gmail.  iPhone does not.  Only way I can get the iPhone to sync is to do a hard reset of the phone (waiting for the white Apple) and then restarting the notes app.\n", "Q: Can't restore iPhone in order to downgrade I just downloaded the iOS 11 beta from Apple's developer website, but I'm having such a headache downgrading back to iOS 10.3.2.\nI installed their provisioning profile from their website, as instructed on their site.\nTo restore, I did the following:\nI restarted my iPhone to recovery mode to restore it, only to be presented this message: \n\nthe iPhone could not be updated. Declined to authorize this image on this device for this user\n\nI rebooted it to find the provisioning profile in order to delete it, only to find that the management page in settings was not there and neither Xcode/Devices nor Apple Configurator 2 showed any profiles.\nNow I'm stuck on iOS 11, and I can't figure out how to downgrade.\nDo you have any ideas?\n\nA: I might have idea but that’s risky - you need to JB your iphone, then use official JB uninstaller (this one in cydia) - it automatically makes factory reset and bypasses even configuration profiles (it just deletes all user’s files - settings, apps, etc. , same as factory reset) .\n", "Q: External disk takes a long time to appear in Finder I'm running Mac OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan) and it seems the larger the external disk I plug in, the longer it takes to show up in Finder.\nA 2TB disk is taking almost a minute.\nIf I plug the same disk on a Windows or Linux PC, it shows up instantly.\nWhy does this happen on Mac? Is there an option or configuration to make the disk show up faster?\n\nA: After upgrading to macOS Sierra, I uninstalled FUSE and ntfs-3g and started using the hidden NTFS support from Apple (through Mounty). The disk now mounts very fast, so I'm assuming it was the NTFS driver.\n", "Q: PAW: command not found I need to install PAW on my system for some analysis. I am working on a Macintosh system (Sierra), I tried installing it through Homebrew : brew cask install paw . The installation was successful, but when I run the script which calls for using paw to plot some data, I get the following error:\nPAW: command not found\nAny suggestions how to fix this? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: PAW may not be in your path. I would first type 'which PAW' and see if it returns with a path to PAW. If it does try using whole path to run PAW or at that directory structure to your path.\nEx. if 'which paw' returns /usr/bin/paw try /usr/bin/paw to run PAW.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Coco-applescript is in my documents folder. I am not a developer. Is it changing the way my apps work? I found Cocoa-AppleScript Applet 2.app in my documents folder. What is this? I noticed it when I was in iTunes and was going to add to my library. I just had to reinstall my OS because of problems and I do remember one of the problems was the iTunes would no longer open at all. I looked this Cocoa thing up and it said something about changing how things should work in iTunes. I don't want to have the same problem again.  I trust that things like that should be ok. I am not a developer and have no reason for this app. \n\nA: A Cocoa-AppleScript doesn't just appear in your documents folder. Someone put it there. With that said, it won't do anything if you don't run it. If you didn't make it, and if someone else uses your computer, I'd ask them what it's there for.\n", "Q: My iPhone is doing math wrong See the images, it's an iPhone 6s, with iOS 10.3.2, does any one have the same issue ?

I then renamed the SD card, and then copied the files to it. The trouble is, that when I unplugged my sd and plugged it back, the password I did set didn't work anymore. I guess it's because I changed the name of my card. I tried many things with the terminal, but I can't get anywhere. Does anybody have an idea that could get me out of this trouble, cause those files are really important to me, I'd be desperate to lose access to them forever.\nMany thanks in advance,\n\nA: You’ll need to step through the process manually using Disk Utility.\nFirst connect the card and then don’t enter anything. Next open Disk Utility and then see if the entire disk is encrypted and how many volumes exist. You can also get this data from the command line:\ndiskutil list\n\nOr the information tab in Disk Utility and perhaps the menu item to show all partitions. It’s possible you erased everything but it’s also possible that you just renamed the volume inside the encryption. It’s hard to guess without specifics and some back/forth between you and someone that knows disk partitioning.\n", "Q: How to record camera with sound from external source on an iPhone 7? Pretty much what I'm trying to do. I want to record the camera's picture but the sound shouldn't come from the microphone directly but via an external audio signal.\nWhat are my options? \nI have either an analog audio signal via a jack cable or using a Windows laptop on the other hand.\nThe problem is: even though AirServer works on Windows and thus I can see my iPhone's picture on it I can't record audio with it from the PC nor record fullscreen video.\nI see that the only way to do this is to buy a Mac and use Quicktime?\nWhat about analog audio to USB going directly into the iPhone, would that work?\nObviously I could edit the two together (video and sound) but I don't want to do that if I can avoid it. \nThanks\n\nA: There are a whole heap of external microphones you can use with the iPhone 7.\nUse the included adapter\nFirstly, the most basic option, is to simply use the Lightning Port > 3.5mm adapter that comes with the phone. This adapter supports Tip Run Ring Sleeve (TRRS), so you could just plug in an external microphone into the iPhone 7 that way (i.e. an external microphone that supports the TRRS plug).\nLightning port microphones\nHowever, if you're looking for a more dedicated solution without an extra adapter in the way, you do have a number of options available if you want to connect directly via the Lightning port.

The Airpods work extremely well at home, in the office, or whenever I'm just walking.  When I'm cycling to work, however, I often get interference in the Bluetooth connection, leading to stuttering music playback.  \nSubjectively it feels as if this is more frequent at large intersections with lots of traffic and never happens in the park.\nWhat could be the source of the interference? \nI imagine that there are many very strong WiFi hotspots in the area, but then I don't really have problems if I'm walking through the city. It seems to be connected to cycling.\n\nA: Bluetooth operates in the 2.4GHz band.  There are a number of other things that operate in this band:\n\n\n*\n\n*WiFi\n\n*Wireless cameras\n\n*Wireless IoT devices\n\n*Bluetooth locating beacons\n\n*Cordless phones\n\n*Microwaves (though I’m fairly certain there’s not a lot of Hot Pocket preparation happening at traffic intersections)\n\n\nAside from the increased Bluetooth bandwidth congestion you’re likely to experience in crowded areas, you are also suseptible to bandwidth crowding from all the other potential sources of interference.  \nFrom personal experience, when riding the subway in NYC, I found that my Bluetooth headset would occasionally become “static-y” especially around rush hour and clear when the train was empty.  A wired headset cured the issue.\n\nA: I think it's less likely to be WiFi interference but more from other Bluetooth devices around. I certainly get this when in busy train stations and when a city street is busy with commuters with wireless headphones.\n", "Q: How do you contact a human behind iTunesConnect? I don't know if the iTunesConnect Contact Us page is a fun way for Apple to troll developers or if there's a hidden path through this maze that I haven't found yet. But from what I can tell, you can't actually contact anyone using the Contact Us page. Instead, it navigates you through a tree of answers that have nothing to do with your actual question, and when you get to the end, you loop back to the beginning, but never actually contact anyone at all.\nI have a question about iTunesConnect. Before I ask it here, I was wondering if there was perhaps another way to get ahold of someone at Apple?\n\nA: Assuming you're a registered Developer, you can just call the Apple Developer Program Support number for your country. \nThe direct link is: https://developer.apple.com/contact/phone/\nIf you wanted to know how to navigate to this, you would just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login at https://developer.apple.com\n\n*Select Support in the main menu\n\n*Scroll down to and select Contact Us\n\n*Scroll down to the Enrollment and Account subheading\n\n*Click on Apple Developer Program Support\n\n*This will open a Contact Us form\n\n*Above your details you'll see a link for call us\n", "Q: Why is Skype using over 1 GB of iCloud backup data? A few weeks ago I began getting notifications warning me that I was running low on iCloud space. I didn't think much of it until I checked my iCloud backups.\n\n\nTo my surprise, between my iPhone and iPad, Skype was inflating the size of my iCloud backups by over 1 GB.\nEven more bizarre was that Skype's documents and data were using up 600 MB less on the devices themselves. (Screenshots from Settings -> General -> Storage & iCloud Usage -> Storage -> Manage Storage)\niPhone data\n\niPad data\n\nThe low storage warnings stopped appearing once I stated excluding Skype data from my iCloud backups, but I'm still perplexed as to why it was using so much space to begin with.\nIs there a reason why Skype would need over 1GB of storage space?\n\nA: Because you are saving all conversations including attachments \n", "Q: Speed of Card Readers Speeds of Macs Is there a way to find the read/write speed of the SDXC card readers on Macs?\nI've been looking for it in System Information, or some chart on the web, to no avail.\n\n(I'm specifically looking for rMBP Mid-2014 13\", however the question is general so it is applicable to more people. However, if you happen to know the answer to this particular computer, please do share. :))\n\nA: \nHow fast can my Mac read or write to an SD card in the SD card slot?\nMac notebooks use the USB bus to communicate with the SD card slot. They have a maximum speed of up to 480Mbit/s. Mac desktops use the PCIe bus to communicate with the SD card slot. Desktops can transfer data at a faster rate.\nCheck the packaging that came with your SD media to determine the maximum transfer rate that your specific card uses.\nTo determine the maximum transfer speed of your Mac, you can use the System Profiler. Go to the Apple () menu > About This Mac and then click System Report.\nIf you use a Mac notebook:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Select Hardware, then select USB.\n  \n*Select Internal Memory Card Reader and look for the Speed entry.\n  \n  \n  If you use a Mac desktop computer:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Select Hardware, then select Card Reader. \n  \n*Look for the Link Speed entry. Computers that use the PCIe bus express their speed as GT/s.\n  \n\nAbout the SD and SDXC card slot on your Mac\n\nA: With the Mid 2015 Retina Macbook Pro that is currently in front of me, I'm only getting about 5.6MB/s read or write speed with the built-in slot. This is with a MicroCenter brand microSD 128GB card in a couple different adaptors as well as with an Angelbird microSD UHS-II V60 card (special card for media productions purposes). Interestingly, the MicroCenter card will work fine with a MiniDrive flush adaptor but the Angelbird doesn't ever show up when installed in the MiniDrive. Conversely, a noname micro->full side SD card adaptor works every time with the Angelbird.\nThis said, I seem to recall getting much better speeds with my 2013 rMBP machines with their internal SD card slots in years past.\n", "Q: Stuck in endless macOS Sierra installation loop I am a long time Apple Mac user since the 1990s, and I have never come across this sort of ridiculous behaviour before.\nYesterday I decided to reinstall macOS Sierra on my iMac. I followed these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I used Command-R to boot into macOS Recovery.\n\n*I selected Disk Utility from the macOS Utilities window.\n\n*I opted to erase the HD with a 2 pass secure erase. This was successful.\n\n*I quit Disk Utility.\n\n*I selected Reinstall macOS from the macOS Utilities window.\n\n*I clicked continue when it told me to click ‘continue’ to set up the installation.\n\n*I clicked continue again when it told me to click ‘continue’ to download and restore macOS\n\n*And now I’m back at Step 6 again and get stuck in a loop between steps 6 & 7.\n\n\nI have tried the above steps again today with the exact same result. Below is a visual representation of this madness:\n\nAlso, clicking on 'continue' instantly displays the next/previous screen - there is no indication that anything else is happening - not even the apparent eligibility check.\nHow do I get out of this looping hell?\nI did read installation stuck in a loop due to damaged HD and Mac OS X Sierra installation stuck in a reboot loop but neither is about the same looping scenario as I find myself in.\n\nA: I had same issue but after connecting to wifi I was able to continue! \n\nA: I just had this issue with High Sierra Beta 4 installation, after about 6-7 loops on APFS file system, I erased my hard disk from Disk Utility and made new partition with HFS+ Journaled file system, then it went through.\nFunny thing is, after installation is done, it says that my file system is APFS.\n\nA: This is the type of UX pain that really irks me, and very unlike Apple.\nSince you're a long time Mac user I'm going to assume you have access to another Mac, so my suggestion would be to try reinstalling a fresh version of macOS Sierra via a USB installer.\nFollow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*On another Mac, download the macOS Sierra installer via the Mac App Store \n\n*After its downloaded, the installer will launch automatically. When it does, quit the installer.\n\n*Grab a USB flash drive of at least 8GB in size\n\n*Connect the USB flash drive to the same Mac\n\n*Rename the flash drive to Untitled\n\n*Launch the Terminal app \n\n*Now enter the following command into Terminal. It may be best to just copy it from here (try triple-clicking) and paste it in. \nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\n*You will be prompted to enter your user password. Enter it now and press return (note that you won’t see the cursor move or display any of the characters you enter)\n\n*At the next prompt (about erasing your drive) press the Y key\n\n*Wait for your USB flash drive to be erased (you’ll see the progress via % values appearing within the Terminal window)\n\n*Once the erasure is complete, you will see a prompt that files are being copied to the disk. This may take a while, so be patient.\n\n*Eventually the copy process will be over and you should see a Done message in Terminal. You can now quit Terminal.\n\n*Eject the USB flash drive and now connect it to your iMac (the one you want to reinstall macOS Sierra on)\n\n*Startup the iMac holding down the option key\n\n*Select the USB flash drive you created from the list of drives and press enter\nYou should now be able to boot from the USB drive and install macOS Sierra from there.\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nA: I had this same exact issue.  If you look in the upper right corner, you need to connect to your Wifi network.   Once connected, when you click Continue on step 7, the installer will continue.   \nVery frustrating Apple didn't give better error messages.   \n\nA: I'm sure you started your computer by now... for anyone new coming to this page, I was able to fix mine after the same thing happened in a much easier way than the best answer. All I did was restart, hold down option-r, and it gives a dialog asking whether you wanna start the installer (default), or start your normal hard drive. Just select your hard drive instead, then head into the app store and try to re-install the update from there.\n\nA: I also had this and it was the wifi just needed reconnecting to allow verification. . \n", "Q: Typing the tilde '~' character on a PC keyboard I'm using my macbook pro with an international Spanish PC keyboard and am trying in vain to find the tilde '~' character.

Are you going to guess at an approximation of the 90° & then flip one by 180° compared to the other?\nDoes that better explain why these systems are measured in microns, not inches? It has little to do with the wavelength at any given frequency & more to do with the orientation of your phase... otherwise you are just as likely to reinforce the wave as to cancel it.\n\nA: I guess that won't work for the simple reason that the lag between microphone and headphones is simply too long to cancel a noise before you hear it.\nIf you use google translate, this article explains the issues in a bit more detail : https://www.heise.de/ct/hotline/PC-Beruhigung-mit-Antischall-319834.html\nWhat kind of works is cancelling a constant noise through a normal headset by calculating and then manually adjusting the phase of the Gegenschall.\n\nA: As much as they would like you to believe it Apple is not capable of violating the laws of physics. \nNoise cancellation works because the relative positions between the speaker, ear and microphone are precisely known. When you have cord between your headphones and microphone (laptop) you no longer know the relative positions.\nMac OS is not a real time operating system, it is unlikely that it could do it even if you could bolt your head to your laptop. \n", "Q: Setting 8-bit/16-bit color depth on macOS without using commercial apps Can I set 8-bit/16-bit color depth system-wide without buying commercial software (e.g. Display Maestro)? I would preferably do this by editing system files, but a free app is OK too.  \n\nA: Check out displayplacer: https://github.com/jakehilborn/displayplacer\nIt's a command line utility, but it works great and is quite simple to use. Example:\n> displaypacer list\n> displaypacer id:<UUID> res:3008x1692 hz:60 color_depth:8 scaling:on\n\nAnd as a CLI utility you can easily script it.  For example: When I switch off of AC power, I have a script which automatically calls displayplacer to switch my resolution to the default retina resolution giving me very slightly improved performance/battery life)\n", "Q: Can MacBooks run without a battery? I have a MacBook Pro (2008). It is a secondary computer I rarely use, so it was easy to last that long with it.\nSuch a long lasting service turned me into an adept of Apple quality. I am looking forward to buy a new one except... nowadays the battery is harder to remove.\nMy concern is not \"a replaceable battery\", it is more of \"a removable battery\". As soon as the battery dies, I would like to keep using the laptop with a power cord. However I've seen all my batteries swelling and/or getting extremely hot. I might be paranoid, but in those cases I just wanted to remove the battery and keep using a good enough laptop.\nIs this possible with new MacBooks? Can they work without a battery attached? Or can their batteries be ignored once they expire?\n\nA: It is well-known that any MacBook with battery removed will run at significantly lower clock speed, typically around 1 GHz. The reason is that the power supply is good enough to supply plenty of power for the average usage, but not for bursts. If your hard drive spins up while the CD drive spins up while all cores and the GPU work full blast and you are charging two iPhones then the power supply won't have enough power for that, but it can take extra power from the battery. \nWith no battery, the MacBook will turn its power consumption down so that it can guarantee to always have enough power, because otherwise you would have instant crashes at the wrong times.\nAnother reason to not remove the battery is that dust will have a chance to get deeper inside your MacBook that would otherwise be blocked by the battery. So unless your battery is swollen, leave it in, even if it only has ten minutes charge left. \n\nA: MacBook Pro Mid 2015 cannot be run without battery at all.\n\nA: I can confirm that a Macbook Pro Retina 2015 (15\") WILL NOT boot correctly without a battery installed.  I was rebuilding a system that had damaged batteries.  Once I pulled the old battery pack you could show boot disk screen, perform hardware check etc, but cannot boot to OS.  You just see the Apple boot screen but will be stuck in a reset loop.  Also fans were on 100%.\nStarted working fine once new battery pack was installed.\n\nA: Well, even tho the battery of the new MacBook pro's are glued with adhesive, they are removable, just harder. Plenty of youtube tutorials explain how to do it. So yeah buy yourself a new battery and replace it and do not run the laptop without a battery.\n\nA: I had an issue with a swollen battery on my 2011 MBP (13\"). While I waited for the replacement battery, I ran it at home with the old battery removed (it was swollen enough that the trackpad didn't work anymore). The machine ran without a problem with no battery plugged in. \nThe only thing you have to watch for is that the MagSafe plug comes unplugged easily… certainly by design! With no battery, this results in a hard shutdown for the computer, so make sure you're careful with the computer (or, better yet, use it like a desktop so there's less chance of jostling the power cable). \nTL;DR: Yes, at least as recently as the 2011 MBP. Likely true for rMBP, not sure on the new ones with TB3. \n\nA: Macbooks without battery work slower than with battery and with new ones you can't replace them because they're glued in so you will need new laptop.\n", "Q: Entering hibernate mode after delay upon going to sleep mode doesn't work when using power supply I've successfully set the MAC to enter hibernate mode after 1 minute delay upon going to sleep mode but it works only on battery power.

Those folders are empty, but no matter how often I try to delete them (rm -r 'foldername'), they re-create themselves. \nI even cannot find them under the \n\nSystem Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive\n\nSo for example I find a folder called\niCloud~com~FireproofStudios~TheRoom3\nI type this in the command line:\nrm -r iCloud~com~FireproofStudios~TheRoom3\nNow the folder is gone, but after a few seconds, it reappears again.\n\nHow can I permanently delete old iCloud Apps and data?\n\nUPDATE\nThis is the Library/Mobile Documents folder\n\nApps like readdle~scanner~pdf (and many more) are not part of the iCloud Drive overview:\n\n\nA: It would help if you would explain why you would like to do this. For example, do you just want to clear up the clutter on your disk? Do you want to erase every trace of deleted apps?\nIf you just want to save space, the relevant command is brctl which is part of bird. (brctl for \"bird control\", as Apple uses the metaphor of the bird flying through the iCloud). At least according to the official documentation, the closest command to what you would be looking for would be brctl evict, but this doesn't remove the folder, but instead remove the local copy. In your example, you would type: \n\ncd ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents\nbrctl evict iCloud~com~FireproofStudios~TheRoom3\n\nI would keep an eye on the brctl man page to see if they add that additional functionality for the future for getting rid of these folders entirely. \n", "Q: Homebrew R vs Microsoft R I understand that math library integration is the main tweak that sets MRO apart from the CRAN R distribution, and gives it a performance advantage. \nI wonder if MRO (Microsoft R Open) binaries still have a performance advantage over Homebrew R, given that both Homebrew R and Microsoft R link their binaries against Accelerate (MKL) math libraries in macOS. \n\nA: In my experience MRO is faster when using data.table and large datasets.\nHowever, in Ubuntu, OS X, etc I found more convenient to use CRAN version and compile everything to avoid crashes, crossed wires, etc.\n", "Q: What the weird files '!' and 'export' are and where do they come from? I have a MacBook which was recently bought and macOS Sierra 10.12.5\nSometimes the weird files named '!' and 'export' are being created in some random directories, for example in my home directory or in others. The files are 0kb both and have such permissions and owner:\n-rw-r--r-- alx(my user) staff\nWhat application creates such files and why? I'm tired of deleting these files from everywhere.\n\nA: I've checked the .bash_profile file and found this lines:\n> export GOPATH=$HOME/go\n> export PATH=$GOPATH:$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n> !\n\nIt looks like I made a mistake when I ran console command during GO installation.

It can be an app, shell script or any tip.\n\nA: To delete a list of comma separated filenames from a folder, you can use the following:\ntr , '\\n' <<< \"file.jpg,second.jpg,…\" | xargs -I{} rm /path/to/folder/{}\n\nReplace file.jpg,second.jpg,… with your comma separated list of files.\nReplace /path/to/folder with the path to the containing folder of the images.\ntr , '\\n' replaces commas in the input with new lines. xargs takes the lines and runs the given command for each line, replacing {} with each line input (as instructed by -I{}). tr is used since xargs in macOS does not support -d for a custom delimiter.\nHowever, I notice that your list does not include file extensions. You can add the extension to the end of the command instead.\ntr , '\\n' <<< \"file,second,…\" | xargs -I{} rm /path/to/folder/{}.jpg\n\n\nA: You can delete a list of comma separated filenames using a CSV by using the following command:\nfor file in $( cat foo.csv | awk '{gsub(\",\",\"\\n\"); print $0}' ); do rm $file; done\n\nYou can make it safer by moving the file to the Trash instead of deleting it:\nfor file in $( cat foo.csv | awk '{gsub(\",\",\"\\n\"); print $0}' ); do mv $file ~/.Trash; done\n\nHow this works\nThis is a FOR/DO loop that first takes the contents of foo.csv and \n\n\n*\n\n*cat foo.csv |  This outputs the entire contents of the CSV file and pipes it to the next command\n\n*awk '{gsub(\",\",\"\\n\"); print $0}  This line takes the output of the previous command and using the awk text processing utility then substitutes the comma (,) for the newline character (\\n).  It then outputs each item (print $0) on a separate line\n\n*each line becomes an \"item\" for the FOR loop to iterate. \n\n*for every item it will issue the command  rm $file\n\n*You can delete/move/rename/whatever each file by modifying the command after do.  (Eg. do mv $file ~/Foo/Bar/$file to move it to another folder.)\n\n", "Q: How do I use a Saved Search as a Desktop Background Folder? I want to use my movie library's Posters and Artwork as a cycling background. The problem is movie managers place each movie in a folder, and then a subfolder for artwork (jpgs). And choosing a Folder for Backgrounds is not recursive.\nIn Finder I ran a search for ‘type:image’ then saved that as \"Movies.savedSearch\".\nThen in the Desktop & Screen Saver preference pane, I tried to add that folder, but it won't drag-n-drop, and if I hit the + to select the folder, it is greyed out / not accessible.\nAny idea how to get this to work?\n\nA: This isn't possible. Smart folders are saved as .savedSearch and aren't real folders, so you can't add them to lists requiring folders.\n", "Q: Can you answer a call with AirPods faster than EarPods?

I do not like all these new products with a million new features but the one important thing adds a few seconds to each use. So I need to know if the AirPods are a step forward or a step backward.\n\nA: AirPods are much quicker, as you don't have to spend 5 minutes untangling them.

There's no /etc/networks/loopback, as it's just the file /etc/networks with the word loopback within.\n", "Q: Cant remove stalled (inProgress) Time Machine backup I have recently switched to a newer MBP from a TM backup. Unfortunately something seems to have gone wrong during the migration. TM cannot complete a backup, it just keep accumulating into a directory, with .inProgress suffix. \nAfter a bit googling I found this answer, which suggests removing the folder by moving it to the Trash. That doesn't really work as it just says Removing files, but there is literally no progress after hours. I tried to remove the folder from the terminal, that's a no go due to Permission Denied.\nI tried to change to a admin account, then do a sudo rm -rf and that results in Operation Not Permitted. Do I need to disable csrutils just to be able to repair a stalled backup?\nSuggestions?\n\nA: tmutil listbackups shows you a list of the backups found on your Time Machine disk.\nTo delete a backup shown in this list, run\ntmutil delete /path/to/backup.inProgress\n\n\nA: The only safe way to delete time machine files is to use tmutil (as explained in grg's answer).  Using sudo rm -rf will seriously damage your backups.  This is because time machine uses hard links to directories.  Hard links to files are safe to delete.  But a recursive delete of a hard link to a directory will actually delete the directory contents.  So your partial backup may contain a hard link to an unchanged directory used in a previous backup.  Deleting that hard link alone wouldn't cause damage, because your previous backup has its own hard link to the directory.  But those two hard links point to the same directory, so when you do a recursive delete of the contents, you're actually deleting the contents of the directory that your previous backup was using.  So now you've ruined your previous backup (and perhaps many previous backups).  There's a reason why Backups.backupdb is locked down.\n\nA: There is a command\ntmutil deleteinprogress <machine_directory>\n\nFrom man page:\n\nDelete all in-progress backups for a machine directory. Requires root\nand Full Disk Access privileges.  On APFS backup destinations, this\nreverts the destination volume to the\nlast backup.\n\n", "Q: Software to clone / recover data from almost dead ssd on MBP MPB 15 2011 with Sierra on an ssd.\nssd is almost dead, Mac OS (Sierra) isn't loading with a folder with question mark showing on boot.

Assuming you don't have a backup, you could try Disk Warrior, as I've found it tends to work well. Although damaged SSDs are trickier than hard drives, it may work.\n\nA: You can also try Stellar Mac Data Recovery, another paid solution.

I somehow doubt it. I'd go for the 3.8GHz i5.\n...or at least I would, but you mentioned Python. Python is one of the slowest of the various interpreted languages commonly used.

I upgraded my iMac from El Capitan to Sierra about 6 weeks ago and all was working well. A few days back I decided I wanted to reinstall macOS Sierra so that I had a clean installation that wasn't upgraded from El Capitan, but was 'fresh' with no old files etc.\nThe first problem I ran into was an endless loop during installation so I posted this question: Stuck in endless macOS Sierra installation loop . Monomeeth got me past this problem by creating a USB installer.\nThen I had an issue with kernel panics upon startup after reinstalling Sierra, so I posted this question: Finally reinstalled macOS Sierra, but now I get a kernel panic and William T Froggard and Monomeeth helped me get past that.\nThen I got this error message:\n\nNote that is a reflection in the photo, not a GPU problem.\nSo I followed the advice and tested my hardware. I selected the extended test and over an hour later the test found no issues. But when I restart and try again, it keeps bring me back to the above error.\nI do not believe I have a hardware issue as there were no signs of problems before I decided to reinstall macOS Sierra. As I mention in my first question, I decided to reformat the HD by doing a 2 pass secure erase and this was successful. So I think that means I have no problems with my HD right? Plus the 1hr hardware test passed also.\nNote that I have already tried booting into the recovery from the recovery partition, and from the internet. I have tried both these options many times. None seem to work. If I hold down alt/option during startup I see a macOS Installer option and a Recovery option:\n\nI have tried both more than once and always get stuck in some sort of loop. \n\n\n*\n\n*Either I boot from the macOS Installer option and get the error in\nthe first image above which goes round in circles because AHT finds\nnothing and we do it all over again.\n\n*Or I boot into recovery and get the whole endless loop described in my first question Stuck in endless macOS Sierra installation loop that Monomeeth helped me with.\n\n*Or I try and boot again from the USB installer Monomeeth helped me create, but while it worked the first time to reinstall macOS Sierra, now I get a gray screen after selecting English for my main language. I'm not sure how this is even possible! Why did it work the first time but not now?\n\n\nObviously I wish I never decided to reinstall macOS Sierra, but now that I have, what do I do from here to get it back on this computer?\n\nA: I've been looking over your other questions and the whole history of your situation and feel like we're missing something here. Not blaming you, I just think something unbeknown has happened (e.g. a power failure at some point you're not aware of that has caused some corruption).\nSo, I'm suggesting you do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your iMac in Target Disk Mode\n\n*Connect it to your MBP (make sure the MBP is connected to AC power)\n\n*Run Disk Utility from the MBP to erase the iMac HD (no need to do another secure erase) and also run First Aid\n\n*Assuming you don't encounter any errors, do a fresh download of the install macOS Sierra app from the Mac App Store (i.e. do not run the installer from the USB installer you created, but download a fresh copy from the App Store directly to your MBP)\n\n*Now run the installer from the MBP\n\n*Follow the steps to install macOS Sierra (ensure you select the iMac's HD to install it on)\n\n\nLet me know if you run into any problems, but hopefully this will resolve the issue once and for all as it eliminates a number of possible problems.\n\nA: The most likely culprit is that your hard drive has failed or is in the process of failing.\nYou've provided lots of good info so let's see if we can digest it all...\n\nThe iMac in question is a mid-2011 27\" model. I just tested it by\nputting a 2012 MBP in target disk mode and booting it from that. It\nbooted fine and seems to run fine.\n\nThis means that your iMac is more than capable of running Sierra and the only component you've isolated that has eliminated your problem is your hard drive.\n\nAs I mention in my first question, I decided to reformat the HD by\ndoing a 2 pass secure erase and this was successful. So I think that\nmeans I have no problems with my HD right? Plus the 1hr hardware test\npassed also.\n\nNot necessarily.  A two pass erase simply writes data to the drive.  The trick here is to do a verification after the write (read the data back).  I have seen many instances where a drive was failing but failed (pun not intended) to report that it was failing.\nMany people like to \"stress test\" their drives in the hope that it somehow fixes things.  This is roughly what you did and it ultimately doesn't make anything better.\n\nThe first problem I ran into was an endless loop during installation\nso I posted this question: Stuck in endless macOS Sierra installation\nloop . Monomeeth got me past this problem by creating a USB installer.\n\nAgain, here we are bypassing the installer by getting it on the USB and not the installer located on the hard drive.  You have effectively isolated your HDD (again) and eliminated the problem (to a point).\nFrom your previous post:\n\nvfs_mountroot is what mounts your root file system that's located on your hard drive.   At the risk of oversimplifying things, your kernel has loaded, but when it tries to load the rest of the OS, things break.  This is the \"panic\" because without it, you can't do anything so it's (figuratively) throwing it's hands up the in the air \"panicking.\"\nFurther down (from the same post) we have this little gem:\n\nThis is telling us that the kernel that got loaded was the install media but that's as far as it got.  Since it couldn't mount the root file system, it stopped here.  It couldn't read the drive, so it couldn't go any further.\nTo Summarize (and TL;DR) ....\n\n*\n\n*You have a 2011 iMac with the original HDD, so it's at least 6 years old.  If I remember correctly the lifespan of the drives installed in the iMac was rated at 3 years1.  If you got 5/6 years out of it, you're pretty lucky and pretty much on borrowed time.\n\n\n*Each time you isolate your internal HDD from the equation; Target Disk Mode with a MBP and/or install from USB, it works fine.\n\n\n*If you want to further verify this, get an external USB drive and install/boot Sierra from that.  If it works, then you know it's your internal drive.\nYour fix...\nGet a new drive; go for an SSD (I use Samsung EVO 850 in my iMac and swear by it).  Your 2011 iMac has it's screen held in with magnets and Torx screws (as opposed to the 2012 and up which uses glue).  Ifixit.com has an excellent tutorial on doing this drive replacement  It's rated as \"moderate\" mostly because the screen is large and unwieldy.  But, if you take your time, you can do this with no problems\n\n1 Per iFixit.com:  Installed drive was WD Caviar Blue.  WD Warranty at the time was 3 years.

I have an iPhone that I fully plan to put on the iOS 11 public beta later this month, but I also have an Apple Watch that's going to be stuck on watchOS 3. Are there going to be any issues from that, such as my phone expecting my Watch to be on watchOS 4?\n(I know that it's impossible to predict what bugs are going to be in a beta, I'm asking more about if anyone has experience running an iOS public beta alongside an Apple Watch on the latest stable watchOS release.)\n\nA: The best indication that this is okay lies in the fact that iOS betas are generally available to the public, while there is no public beta program for watchOS. So yes, it’s fine to run an iOS beta with a stable release of watchOS.\nApple has no mechanism in place to force you to run a certain version of watchOS with a given version of iOS (other than the minimum version required to install watchOS). They don't force you to update watchOS along with iOS. Barring such guarantees, they cannot make any assumptions as to the version of the operating system you’re running on a separate product.\nHowever, as with any beta software always be prepared for unexpected bugs. For instance the iOS 11 Beta 2 release notes mention the following issues with earlier versions of watchOS:\n\nKnown Issues\nPairing an iPhone running a beta of iOS 11 and an Apple Watch running a version of watchOS earlier than 4.0 may fail.

Signing out and back into the App Store does not resolve this issue.\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*How do users get their previously downloaded macOS Sierra installation to appear in the list?\n\n*How can users ensure that macOS Sierra (or later versions of macOS) are available to them when newer versions of macOS are released?\n\nA: Contrary to past OS releases where the N-1 installer is removed soon after version N launches, Apple has an article with links to the store and detailed requirements for getting and installing macOS Sierra (even after High Sierra is out).\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208202 -  How to download macOS Sierra\n\n*macOS Sierra Installer on the Mac App Store\nI would use the help article HT20802 to check for an updated link if the Mac App Store one fails you. As soon as you get Sierra installed, I would make a bootable USB drive for your personal rescue kit - especially if macOS Recovery isn't available for your hardware or typical network situation.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I make a bootable USB flash drive a Mac?\n\nA: The download of macOS Sierra is not linked to an Apple ID. In fact, users can download it without having to sign into the Mac App Store.\nAnother recent change made by Apple is the inclusion of an additional macOS Recovery option. Instead of two, we now have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*commandR to reinstall the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version \n\n*optioncommandR to upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac\n\n*shiftoptioncommandR to reinstall the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available1\n1 That third option is a new option only available since 27 March 2017 and requires macOS Sierra 10.12.4.\nThe result of these changes is that in future, if you need to install a compatible version of macOS that is earlier than the one that is still available, you will need to have a copy of the installer. \nIn summary, if you wish to have a version of macOS available for possible future installation, it is recommended that you download and store the relevant installer so that it is available to you. You don’t need to install it to do this, you can download it via the Mac App Store and then quit the installer when it launches. You can then make a copy of it for future use.\n[Update as at 3 October 2017]\nThis edit provides an update on how users can access a macOS Sierra installer for Macs that already have macOS High Sierra installed.\nAs I previously recommended, if you wish to have a version of macOS Sierra available for possible future installation, users needed to download and store the relevant installer so that it was available to them.\nAfter discussion with Apple today (3 October 2017), the following is how things will work if you happen to want to install macOS Sierra on a Mac that already has macOS High Sierra installed (assuming the Mac in question supports a macOS Sierra installation):\n\n\n*\n\n*If your Mac originally shipped with macOS Sierra, then the easiest option is to use the shiftoptioncommandR recovery option to reinstall macOS Sierra\n\n*If your Mac did not originally ship with macOS Sierra, then the only official options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*use a copy of the macOS Sierra installer that you've previously downloaded and saved (if you have one), or\n\n*take it into an Apple Store where they can install macOS Sierra for you (but how long this would be an option was questionable).\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT - If your Mac originally shipped with El Capitan or earlier and also supports a macOS Sierra installation, you cannot use the shiftoptioncommandR recovery option to reinstall the original macOS in the hope you can then upgrade to macOS Sierra. Instead, doing this will only result in the Mac App Store offering macOS High Sierra as the next upgrade option.\nIn relation to option 1 above, if you can obtain a copy of the macOS Sierra installer through other means (such as from a friend), then this will also work. Obviously, downloading the macOS Sierra installer from dubious sources is not recommended and is at your own risk. \n[Update as at 18 October 2017]\nPlease refer to bmike's answer. Apple has just published a new help article that provides a way for users to install macOS Sierra.\n\nA: IMPORTANT:\nIf you're downgrading from 10.13 to 10.12 on a drive formatted as APFS, then DO NOT downgrade using macOS Sierra (10.12 Installer) disk utility to Erase your disk. Instead you HAVE TO use the Online Recovery tool (or High Sierra (10.13) Disk Utility) to Erase your disk from APFS back to HFS+, then restart and use your macOS Sierra installer from USB.\nIf you use Sierra to Erase disk, you'll get stuck in a Reboot Loop which is what happened to me.\n", "Q: System Integrity Protection breaks DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for python scripts I have some custom modules that are generated using SWIG that are installed in a a local path eg:\ncatkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/site-packages\n\nWhen I try to run a python script that uses one of these modules, I get an import error:\n\"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/importlib/__init__.py\", line 37, in import_module\n    __import__(name)\nImportError: No module named _mag_manip\n\nI've figured out that this is due to the shebang at the top of the python script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nBecause /usr/bin/env is protected by System Integrity Protection (SIP), the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is not loaded and some modules cannot be found. A fix is to replace the shebang with the hardcoded path of python ie:\n#!/usr/local/bin/python\n\nSince my code runs on Linux and Mac OSX, replacing the normal python shebang with a hardcoded path on mac is not a really good solution. Does anybody know what the best solution is here?\n\nA: Note: This only works in the Z shell (zsh).\nAlthough I would normally say this is a bad idea, I can't see anything wrong with doing this with env, which is a pretty harmless command. Try copying env into /usr/local/bin and replacing /usr/bin/env python in the shebang with just env python (without the absolute path). Assuming you have /usr/local/bin somewhere near the beginning of your PATH variable on OS X, it'll pick up the relocated one, which will no longer be covered under SIP. That shebang will also work on Linux.\n", "Q: Simulate a 13 inch display on 15 inch MacBook Pro Is there any way to simulate a 13 inch display on a 15 inch MacBook Pro?

If that's happening - you might need to fix the sync or fix the data store in the cloud since it might be pushing down \"deletion\" records which would happen as again as soon as you restore a backup.\nBasically, it depends on where your contact data lives permanently.

(for example, Documents can be encrypted if I lock the device).\nI would like to know this to correctly write a privacy policy for an iOS app that uses file sharing.\n\nA: The visibility of the Documents folder for any given App since iOS 9 requires the developer to enable iTunes Sharing to make the contents of the Documents folder visible to iTunes (and presumably any 3rd party software that knows how to communicate with the device).  By default, file sharing is not enabled.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301\nWhat you need for File Sharing\n\n\n*\n\n*The latest version of iTunes.\n\n*The latest version of macOS or an\nup-to-date version of Windows 7 or later.\n\n*An iPhone, iPad, or iPod\ntouch with the latest version of iOS.\n\n*An iOS app that works with File\nSharing.\n\n\nSince iOS 11, Apple has introduced a new Files App that gives the user file visibility on the device.  Again, the developer needs to use an API to enable what is visible to the user.\n", "Q: Understanding Wifi Usages i live in a rural area and my internet provider is satellite.  When my son is downloading a movie and the wheel beside wifi icon is spinning and spinning is that using wifi data? It could take a half hour before the movie downloads. He is constantly trying to download and eventually gets it.  He is saying no data is used in searching. I do not agree. I think searching is using data. Am I correct?  As long as that wheel is spinning you are using data.\n\nA: The menu bar and application spinners are very indirect / poor ways to see if network traffic is flowing. They can indicate a dropped connection, stalled data connection if a request was made and not aknowledged.\nYou would do best to log in to your router and see a traffic graph. If that's not feasible, you can also open Activity Monitor on the Mac.\nThere is a network activity graph that shows packets per second and bandwidth in real time.\nBasically - when someone says \"no data is used when I search\" the correct answer is - \"great, go ahead and disconnect from WiFi while you search since you don't need data to do that\". It's possible the data exchanged during search / navigation is low, but it's not going to be no data.\n", "Q: Mac OS: 7.5.3 Command-Turn On I'm not a mac user anymore.

Until this day I have not the slightest idea what that thing was.\n\nA: That was the Debugger window that was built into the Mac's ROM. I never learned what language worked in it. \n\nA: Yes, that was MacsBug!

I've a backup saved at iCloud from Yesterday, and I would like to know if I reset my phone back to iOS 10.3 it's ok to restore this backup, even if it was made at iOS 11. There is something that I have to take careful or something that I will lose during the process?\nIm okay about having to download all the apps again, I just dont want to lose the phone data (WhatsApp chats, Contacts, Photos).\n\nA: You can't restore a backup from a newer iOS version to an older iOS version.\nYou should have an iTunes backup from before you updated iOS. If not, you will have to manually extract the data from your iOS 11 backup and add it back to your device after setting up your iPhone as new with iOS 10.3. How you do this depends on the individual app — many use iCloud such as iCloud backup in WhatsApp which will help you do this automatically, but otherwise it will be a case of manually editing a fresh backup of your iOS 10.3 device with an app such as iBackupBot. For things which are incompatible with older iOS such as your messages history, this will be unable to be restored to the older iOS.\nUnfortunately all I can say is that you are warned of the perils of installing beta iOS prior to acceptance of the beta program. My suggestion is to put up with iOS 11 and keep updating to the latest beta as it becomes available, which will fix many of the bugs. You'll be updating to iOS 11 anyway in the future.\n\nA: If you have data from WhatsApp, Phone, etc... that you want to keep, there is no reliable way to get it onto iOS 10 from iOS 11 backup.  iCloud will have whatever is on there and that data is available to iOS 10 or iOS 11 but not everything is on iCloud.\nThe best solution is to just stick with iOS 11 and get updates as they come.\nN.B. - Every Apple hacker makes this mistake at some point so embrace it!  Apple OS betas are really rough around the edges.  Bugs & battery life issues abound.\n\nA: Be sure to focus on the “you can’t restore a newer backup on older iOS” part of this other answer.\nYou will not be able to get back text messages, sync with apple music, and many more. Upgrading to the beta will mean rolling back to 10.3.2 will ruin any icloud functionality except photos and contacts\n", "Q: How to read passwords and notes from keychain on non-apple OS? I see one solution — install macOS on virtual machine and do the job in it, but installing macOS in a VM is a huge PITA, even if I find where to download the os distribution.

Nothing happened.\nI'm new at trying to use Automator.

What am I overlooking or not understanding?\n\nA: The Stickies app is not scriptable, meaning it does not directly support AppleScript via a Stickies AppleScript Dictionary, so most coding is going to use System Events and what's generally referred to as UI Scripting to manipulate the Stickies app.\nThe example code below, will do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Stickies.app and, or if already open, bring it to the front.\n\n*Create a new Stickies note.\n\n*Move the new note to the top left corner of the screen and set its size to the default size.\n\n*Type \"AW\" and \"return\", with \"return\" simulating the Enter key being pressed.\n\n\n\ntell application \"Stickies\"\n    activate\n    delay 1\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"n\" using command down\n    set properties of window 1 of application process \"Stickies\" to {position:{0, 23}, size:{300, 200}}\n    keystroke \"AW\" & return\nend tell\n\nThis AppleScript code can be placed in a Run AppleScript action in an Automator Service workflow.\n\nNote: One of the drawbacks of UI Scripting, is at times the needed use of the delay command to ensure the targeted UI Element is available to be acted upon. You may/will need to either adjust the value of any delay command and or add/remove additional delay commands as needed/wanted through any given UI Scripting scenario. The example code above, as is, worked on my system. If need be, make use of the delay command and adjust its value as/where needed/wanted.\nAlso the above example code does not employ any form of absolute error handling and is meant only to show how the individual events can be coded to achieve the objective. The onus is always upon the User to add/use appropriate error handling as needed/wanted. \n", "Q: AppleScript bug: When placing plain text on the clipboard, the text is always converted to rich text Run the following code to put some text on your clipboard:\nset testString to \"This string should be plain text.\"\nset the clipboard to testString\n\nIf you open up a new .rtf file in TextEdit.app, and paste the clipboard into this document, you will observe that the clipboard contains rich text.

For a long time I've kept a collection of MP3 files and other audio formats on a NAS device, organizing selected titles in iTunes but keeping the files off my system. Now, I'd like to copy them to my local system.\nDragging all the files to my \"Music\" folder is the obvious choice, but it made me wonder, what exactly is the difference between dumping a bunch of files into a sub-folder under \"Music\" versus just putting them in some random location within my home directory?\nAre they indexed differently? Do apps see them differently? Or are loose (i.e. moving them around doesn't break anything) files in \"Music\" treated like files I have anywhere else?\n\nA: You can put the 'root' of the iTunes Media directory, \"iTunes Music\", where you like - though personally I prefer to keep all the actual database files in their original location & just move the song files themselves.\nThis is quite possibly the setup you currently have.\nTo move it anywhere else, the simplest way is to change the directory in iTunes prefs > Advanced to the new desired location.\nAlso check 'keep organised' & 'copy files to media folder'\n\nIt's been a long time since I did this, so the next step may be automatic or manual - test to see.\nAuto - when you OK that dialog iTunes will ask you if it can consolidate to the new locations; say yes.\nManual - if it doesn't ask, then from File menu > Library > Consolidate files to have it do the same manually.\nThis will copy all the song files it is currently keeping track of into the new location - & will then always use that location whenever you add new music.\nNote that in my example above iTunes_Remote is the top level directory; inside it iTunes will then make the required folders for Audiobooks, Movies, Music, etc, as needed.\n\nA: Simple answer, there is no difference where a file is that will make it any different based on placement on the computer.\nThe reason you have a \"Music\" Folder on the mac is just for organization. An already created folder for you to easily place all your music in. Placing your music into the Documents, or Downloads folder will still make the playable by any Music player application.\nHowever there is a benefit for having mp3 files in your Music folder because iTunes looks in that directory automatically for files to add to your library.\nSo to answer all your questions...\n1) Are they indexed differently? Define 'indexed'.. They aren't treated differently if that's what you're asking.\n2) Do apps see them differently? No, but iTunes does look in the Music folder for playable files and nowhere else on your system.\n3) Loose files? Like I said above, any file anywhere on your system is still the same file 'type'. It doesn't matter where it's located. It doesn't make it something else due to placement. Again, those directories are intended for organization.\ntldr; put them into your Music folder for iTunes to quickly find the files.\n", "Q: What does the search domain in the network preferences do?

If it doesn't, is it backed-up using itunes? \n\nA: If the user chooses to include your app in their iCloud backup, then all the files which the app makes available for backup are backed up, such as files in the app container's Documents folder. Store your database here for it to be backed up.\n", "Q: iCloud storage fail when trying to reset games I have recently been trying to reset data for a few of my games on iOS 10. I am aware that i have to go into iCloud and then documents and data to delete this. But somehow i managed to remove the games from documents and data, they are no longer there. Yet the app still saves my data. Help?\n\nA: If you reset the iCloud data and the game data persists, you have likely discovered the game vendor is storing your game data and just linking it to the app install or to your AppleID / account.\nThe best place for help would be the vendor or a second question listing precisely what app you are using, what version of that app and what steps you take to clear iCloud - if other devices are syncing data, removing data on one device might not remove it from the cloud / other devices.\n", "Q: What exactly is required for Apple's Find-my-car feature to work? My friends and I have noticed inconsistent results with Apple's feature to find your parked car. We've all seen it work sometimes, but not always. \nThe feature I'm talking about is described here: http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/06/14/apple-maps-ios-10-parking/ \nAs I understand it, you must have Car Play or Bluetooth in your car, you must have iOS 10.x or greater, and have Apple Maps installed. Beyond that, how does this work? \nI've tried a couple of times lately to test this, making sure that Bluetooth is connected during the trip. After arriving, I can ask Siri: \"Where's my car?\" and I get: \nSorry, I don't see any saved parking locations.\nIt seemed to be working reliably for a user with Car Play.  Is that required? \n\nA: Yes, you must have a CarPlay device & the iPhone must connect to it when you get in the car & disconnect as you leave.\nThat is the trigger to update your Parked Location.\nIt works over either direct connection on Lightning cable, or using Bluetooth, though if your CarPlay is set to Lightning, it will not update if you have Bluetooth on, but don't manually switch to it - CarPlay does not 'auto-swap' to Bluetooth if you don't plug it in.\nApple documents this here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207227\nThe location privacy can show you frequent locations as well as parked locations, so if you have disabled that location tracking, you could expect maps to not mark your Bluetooth disconnect locations. Also, not pairing to Bluetooth would likely prevent is feature from working \n(Information source in addition to above is personal experience & wondering how the heck it sometimes worked & sometimes didn't ;)\n", "Q: What type of SSD does macbook pro 2015 use? I want to upgrade the ssd from my macbook pro.\nWhat type of SSD do I need to buy?\n\nA: You probably need a part like this, but you should check your exact Mac model number with the compatibility list. If you browse by interface or size, keep in mind that if the firmware on the drive isn't equivalent to what Apple sources internally, your part might physically fit but the RAID controller and firmware might result in errors or failure to operate.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/SSDAB2MB02/\nI would recommend partnering with a shop that can provide pre- and post- sales support since Apple doesn't publicly disclose what specific vendors, chipsets and firmware levels it supports. Basically, multiple parts and vendors might be inside any given MacBook 2015 so buying non-apple parts might require a return or two if the vendor doesn't get you a 100% compatible part.\n", "Q: Why can't I run the WWDC app? Today when I tried to use the WWDC app (version 5.0.1) on my iPad, I got a message saying that this version is no longer supported, and I need to get an update from the App Store.  But when I go to the App Store, it is not offering any update for the WWDC app.  What gives?  Maybe it's a temporary delay in posting a new version, or maybe there's a new version that does not run on my 3rd-generation iPad (iOS 9.3.5)?\n\nA: I can't speak for Apple, but this is likely an intentional decision to walk away from the server side / api calls for the older version of the WWDC app.\nOne of the core messages for iOS 11 is that all 32 bit platforms and apps are done for developers, and Apple making a hard stop of functionality (programming in a message telling you your app is too old). Programming in a kill switch could be seen as reinforcing that experience for developers. \nThe temporary good news is despite this move, you can still watch WWDC 2017 content on iOS 9 in Safari. The news on 64 bit only requirements was covered in the Platforms State of the Union keynote (2017 session 102) I believe.\n\nA: You're not shown the update to the WWDC app as it requires iOS 10.3 but you indicated you're running iOS 9. Just update iOS and the app.\n", "Q: Water resistant MacBook or Air? My kid has so far poured my large mug of coffee into our Air, then barfed on it (yes, it got inside) and now another cup of coffee. That last one finally killed it. Apple says the mobo is gone and it will cost more to fix than its worth.\nSo now I'm going to either get another Air or maybe just the Book. In either case, can someone offer any suggestions on how to make it even slightly more liquid resistant?\n\nA: You could use a keyboard protector to make the laptop slightly more resistant to spills.\nFor example a product like the Moshi ClearGuard Keyboard Protector.\n", "Q: Google Chrome crashes with EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION on Sierra New iMac running Sierra 10.12.5. 3 days ago suddenly started freezing intermittently for 3-5 minutes at a time.

I have a late 2014 Mac Mini running macOS Sierra 10.12.5. When I paired it with my Bluetooth keyboard, I was not prompted to enter a sequence of numbers. \nHow does macOS validate and secure connections between Bluetooth keyboards without prompting for a code? Does it just use trust-on-first use? Is it possible to force macOS to use a pairing code?\n\nA: TL;DR answers to questions\n\nHow does macOS validate and secure connections between Bluetooth\n  keyboards without prompting for a code?\n\nIt's not just macOS - your keyboard is connected and encrypted at the firmware level - if it wasn't you wouldn't be able to perform an NVRAM reset before the OS loads.\nHowever, you don't need a code because modern Bluetooth keyboards use an authentication algorithm to pair and a generated authentication key based on public keys to secure the data transmissions.\n\nDoes it just use trust-on-first use?\n\nNo.  It verifies its identity using an algorithm and 128-bit generated keys.\n\nIs it possible to force macOS to use a pairing code?\n\nWhy?  This would be going back to pre-2009 pairing methodologies.  This would be the equivalent of enabling WEP shared keys on modern WiFi networks.\n\nBluetooth Pairing\nThe process you described for pairing a Bluetooth device (a keyboard in your example) uses an old (Bluetooth 2.1) method of authentication called Simple Secure Pairing (SSP). \nBasically, SSP has 4 association (pairing) models:\n\n\n*\n\n*Numeric Comparison.  Both devices have input and display so the user can simply select \"Yes\" or \"No\" to pair the device\n\n*Passkey One device has input capability (like a keyboard) and the other has display capability (like a computer).  The device with display capability shows a 4 to 6 digit number and the device with input capability enters it.\n\n*Just Works  This is for devices with no display or input capability (like headsets) where you can't see or enter a passkey.\n\n*Out of Band (OoB) This is for devices that support an additional common wireless technology (NFC) where the devices have to be in very close proximity to each other.  One device must \"tap\" the other device before pairing will occur.\n\n\nThe most important thing to note is that SSP is NOT the encryption key; it's merely the pairing mechanism to identify each other.  Encryption is handled through a public key.  The code you enter is to make sure that's the device you want to connect to; it's not the security.\nSince Bluetooth 3.0 (April 2009), Bluetooth devices uses an AMP key for authentication which automates the above process. \n\nAMP Key Derivation\n  AMP link key is derived from the Bluetooth link key. A Generic AMP Link\n  Key(GAMP_LK)is generated by the AMP Manager in the host stack whenever\n  a Bluetooth link key is created or changed\nAuthentication\nThe Bluetooth device authentication procedure is in the form of a\n  challenge–response scheme. Each device interacting in an authentication\n  procedure   to as either the claimant or the verifier. The\n  claimant is the device attempting to prove its identity, and the\n  verifier is the device validating the identity of the claimant. The\n  challenge–response protocol validates devices by verifying the\n  knowledge of a secret key — the Bluetooth link key.\n\n\nEncryption\nThere are 4 modes of encryption\n\n\n*\n\n*Mode 1 - No encryption\n\n*Mode 2 - Individually addressed traffic is encrypted based on keys which are based on the link keys\n\n*Mode 3 - All traffic is encrypted using keys based on the master key\n\n*Mode 4 - (Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR) mandates all traffic is encrypted except for service discovery\n\n\nBluetooth keyboards using Bluetooth 2.1 (keyboards from 2009 and beyond) and up encrypt all their traffic.\n\nSOURCE:  SP 800-121 Rev. 2, Guide to Bluetooth Security (May 2017)\n", "Q: Is it possible for an AppleScript application's \"Quit\" button to override (i.e., cancel) an open dialog? To witness the issue to which I refer, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an AppleScript that simply contains one display dialog dialog.\n\n*Save this script as an .app file.\n\n*Run the .app file.\nIf you right-click the file's Dock icon, then left-click Quit, as depicted in the following screenshot:\n\nyou will observe that nothing happens. That is, the application remains open.\nThe keyboard shortcut, ⌘ command + Q, is similarly futile.\nThe only way to quit this application (excluding clicking \"Force Quit\" in Activity Monitor.app) is to click a button in the application's active dialog.\nIs it possible to make an AppleScript application's inherent \"Quit\" function quit out of the application, even if the application is currently displaying a dialog when the \"Quit\" function is called?\n\nNote: The display alert dialog and the choose from list dialog behave in the same domineering manner as the display dialog dialog.\n\nA: The short answer is, no.\nThe longer answer is: By design, an AppleScript's display dialog creates an application modal object, meaning that until the User responds to the controls of the object, the application waits until is receives appropriate input to that object in order for it to continue.\nIf a Cancel button exists and not the default button, it can be dismissed by pressing the Esc key or a Command-period key press to activate the Cancel button. If you use a Cancel button, you can trap the error and execute a return that will halt execution of the remaining code of the app.\nIf if doesn't have a Cancel button then it can't be dismissed without direct interaction or forced quit by any one of several methods.\nTo force quit:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can option-right-click the app's Dock tile and select Force Quit from App's Dock tile context-menu.\n\n*Press Option-Command-Esc to bring up the Force Quit Applications dialog box.\n\n*Force quit it from Activity Monitor.\n\n*Its process can also be killed from Terminal in a few different ways, but beyond the scope of this answer as it's not a GUI method.\n\n\nAlso, ⌘Q doesn't work because it's grayed out in the App's Menu bar menu.\nAll this is also true within the Script Editor itself, not just with an AppleScript app. Once a display dialog is present it must be interacted with appropriately or the app forced quit by one method or another.\n", "Q: Can I untick all checklist items in an iOS Notes note? I've prepared a checklist for air travel with our two kids. Currently everything is ticked but I want to reset it for our next trip.

Click it again to \"mark as unchecked\".\n\nA: You can uncheck checked items in the iOS Notes app using the following hack. \n1. Select the checklist of items you want to be unchecked.(This can include either checked or unchecked items.)\n2. Remove the check-mark format.

In the 20 or so days that my retina MacBook has been turned on, in Activity Monitor I can see that around 2 TB of data has been written and 1.2 TB read. Most of the written data seem to come from kernel_task, with about 800 GB written to disk. However, altogether the processes in Activity Monitor add up to only 1 TB written (not 2 TB, which is the total data written). What's even stranger is that the sum of the read data adds up to about 250 GB, which is much lower than the 1.2 TB read that Activity Monitor shows. When observing Activity Monitor, the data read or written per second goes to around 100 MB/sec even 15 seconds or so.\nHow exactly can I figure out what is eating my disk like this? I'm afraid that if this continues, my total read/write amounts will go up to nearly 40 TB in a year, and eventually wear out my SSD more quickly than it should.\n\nA: This happened to me once.

In order to change an iTunes store (switch to another country) I need to cancel my Apple Music subscription. I knew that, but what I didn't know is that after cancelling it I have to wait till the paid period ends, even though I don't care and would like to change the store right now.\nBut okay, that's water under the bridge, and soon this period will end. However, I have a paid iCloud Storage Plan as well. Should it be reset to default 5 GB as well in order to switch between iTunes stores?\nI mean, if after my current Apple Music paid period will finally vanish, is it possible that iTunes will ask me to cancel iCloud Storage Plan too, and then I'll have to wait till the end of its paid period as well?

However, there are a few games I like to play in my free time, like Amorphous+.\nLately (I can't tell you which OS it started happening on, but it happens on Sierra and it didn't happen, back when I was using Snow Leopard), whenever I restart my computer all progress made in those games disappears.\nI understand these games save your progress by storing information somewhere on the computer's hard drive. If I right-click on the flash game, I get a contextual menu which includes the options \"Settings\" and \"Global settings\":\n\n\n*\n\n*If I select \"Settings\" and then go to the \"Local storage\" tab, the option to allow the website that hosts the flash game to save files to my computer is selected. \n\n*If I select \"Global settings\" and then go to the \"Storage\" tab, the selected option is the one that says \"Allow sites to save information on this computer\".\n\n\nA: I just found a solution!\nGo to Safari->Preferences->Privacy. For cookies and website data, check \"Always allow\". Refresh the page and the games save correctly. But you need to risk your privacy doing so.\nEdit: It could be Kongregate changing locations of Flash game file recently causing this issue.\nEdit 2: I think I found the cause of the issue. I have compared the source code of some webpages on Kongregate. On the pages where the games do not save correctly (such as Anti-Idle: The Game and Amorphous+), there is a string \"konggames\" in the source code. In the previous states as on Web Archive, there is no such string in the source code. To show that this is indeed the cause and not just the same string appearing everywhere on Kongregate, I checked the game Solarmax 2 and found that the game saves correctly and of now, and there is no string \"konggames\" in the source code.\nThis means that Kongregate has recently changed the host of some games to this \"konggames\" thing. By choosing \"allow cookies from websites I visit\"  or stronger settings in the preference, you effectively caused Safari and Flash unable to load save correctly because you have not visited the site \"konggames\".\n\nA: Safari can't do anything about Flash being terrible. Flash is its own environment, (almost) completely separate from the rest of the website. If Flash is messing something up, it's likely that Safari has little to nothing to do with it.\n", "Q: Install Windows 10 Creators Update on iMac11,2 without first installing Windows 8 Having trouble installing Windows 10 version 1703 on the old iMac (iMac11,2  MC509LL/A) running macOS 10.12.5.\nThe official page said it didn't support Windows 10, but according to my experience as long as it supports Windows 8, it supports Windows 10, too.

The file:\nI created an AppleScript .scpt file in Script Debugger.app.\nHere is how I assigned a custom icon to this .scpt file:\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded a unique icon (in the \"512px PNG\" format) from IconArchive.com.\n\n*I opened the .png file with Preview.app. In Preview, I clicked Edit ⟶ Copy, to place this image on my clipboard.\n\n*I opened the .scpt file's Get Info window in Finder. I left-clicked on the default icon, found in the top-left corner of the Get Info window. A blue outline then appeared around the default icon, reflecting that the icon was selected.\n\n*Finally, I pasted the custom icon over the default icon via the keyboard shortcut, ⌘ command + V. The custom icon was set immediately. I closed out of the Get Info window.\n\nThe bug:\nWhen I open the .scpt file in Script Debugger, to edit the code, and then resave the .scpt file, the custom icon disappears.\nOn save, the following icon immediately takes the place of the custom icon: \n\n(This is OS X's default icon for .scpt files.)\nOf course, having to go through the process of setting the custom icon every time that I save (i.e., edit) the file is an inconvenience.\nBut, there is also a second, corollary bug: Each time that I re-add the custom icon in the Get Info window, the file size of the .scpt file cumulatively increases. In other words, when Script Debugger deletes the custom file icon, the icon's file size is still included, somehow, as part of the overall .scpt file size.\nCase in point: the file size of the .scpt file in question is 12.6 MB, at the moment. The file should not be larger than .5 MB.\n\nThe question:\nI understand how to set a custom file icon to an AppleScript .app file, so that this custom icon remains in place after editing, but I am curious if the same can be done for an .scpt file.\nIs there a way for my custom script icon to remain in place, even after the .scpt file has been modified in Script Debugger?\nThis is an .scpt file that is launched via the FastScripts.app menu bar drop-down menu. (The .scpt file is located in /Users/Me/Library/Scripts.) The FastScripts drop-down menu actually displays the file icons of the scripts, which is a nice feature. This is the reason why I want to set a custom icon to the .scpt file (i.e., so that I can observe an apposite icon in the FastScripts shortcut menu).\nNo, it is not a big deal to simply convert the AppleScript .scpt files that I want to have a custom file icon to AppleScript .app files. I ask this question just to see if there is something that I am missing or overlooking here.\n\nWhat about Script Editor?\nIt appears that this bug is unique to Script Debugger.\nWhen I follow the same steps in OS X's native AppleScript editing program, Script Editor.app, the .scpt file icon remains in tact, upon save. However, I could've sworn that I have, in fact, experienced this issue in Script Editor, in the past.\nFor example, I recall that, once, Script Editor refused to save a .scpt file that I had edited; a vague error dialog was presented on Save. To successfully save the file, I had to either delete the custom icon from Finder's Get Info window, or copy the code text and paste it into a new .scpt file (which, of course, would necessarily possess the default .scpt file icon).\nBut, at this time, I can no longer reproduce the error in Script Editor.\nAt any rate, I try to not use Script Editor to edit my AppleScripts anymore. This is because Script Editor is laggy, potentially crashes when using a third-party script library, and can be temperamental when it comes to opening and saving files.\nIn my experience, so far, Script Debugger has none of these issues.\nOf course, Script Debugger does have at least one issue, though (i.e., the issue detailed in this post).\n\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \n\n\nA: Generally speaking, when a User assigns a custom icon to a file by copying and pasting an image file into the icon, in the top left corner, on the file's Get Info sheet, the image file is stored as a com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute of the file it's applied to, and can be seen in Terminal using ls -l@ filename.ext to show the file has extended attributes. To manipulate the extended attributes, use the xattr utility in Terminal. Note that the use of the term image file in this contact is any valid source copied on the Clipboard to then be pasted in the Get Info sheet.\nHaving to reapply the icon file after having saved the .scpt file in Script Debugger causes the com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute to continue to grow in size, while possibly loosing access to the accumulated icon files, can't say for sure as I've not done enough testing. Unfortunately, while Script Editor keeps the custom icon file, nonetheless it appears to grow the size of the com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute as well.\nTo reduce the size of file by removing specifically the com.apple.ResourceFork extended attributes,  use the following command syntax in Terminal:\nxattr -d com.apple.ResourceFork filename.ext\n\nThen reapply the custom icon to the file.\nHave a look at the man page for xattr in Terminal by typing, xattr and then right-click on it selecting Open man Page from the context-menu.\nThe issue with Script Debugger resetting to the default icon will probably have to be taken up with the Developer, or use the workaround suggested in wch1zpink's answer.\nSince the com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute grows regardless of which of the apps you use, Script Editor or Script Debugger, this is an issue that Apple need to address.\nI know you're using OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, however I tested this under macOS Sierra 10.12.5 and the behavior apparently being the same, it probably doesn't matter that I tested this in a later OS release. I was using Script Debugger 6.0.4. \nBecause of the repetitiveness of what you're doing, a scripted solution is in order here to reduce the effort necessary to maintain both a small file size, inclusive of it extended attributes, and the custom icon.\n\nUpdate:\nHaving gone down a similar road, under OS X 10.8.5, with programmatically setting a file's icon, and having tested almost every solution presented under How can I change a file or folder icon using the Terminal, I chose to use setfileicon from this answer, as it worded the best for my needs at the time.\nThe following AppleScript code is example code that can programmatically delete the com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute of the target file to reduce it accumulative size and reset the target file's icon. It is written around the use of the workaround suggested in wch1zpink's answer, referencing locking the file to keep the icon intact during a save under Script Debugger.\nThe main purpose of this example code is to show how to delete the com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute of the target file and reset its custom icon programmatically. I've thrown in the code to unlock/lock the target file if you choose to use that method of keeping the icon intact between saves, if not it can be removed. I guess it just depends on how often to want to reset the size of the target file's com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute.\ntell current application\n\n    set theTargetFilename to \"filename.scpt\" as string\n    set theHomeFolderPath to (path to home folder) as string\n    set theScriptsFolder to (path to scripts folder) as string\n    set theTargetFilePathname to theScriptsFolder & theTargetFilename as alias\n    set theTargetIcon to quoted form of (POSIX path of (theHomeFolderPath & \"bin:icon.icns\") as string)\n    set theTargetExecutable to quoted form of (POSIX path of (theHomeFolderPath & \"bin:setfileicon\") as string)\n\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set locked of theTargetFilePathname to false\n    do shell script \"xattr -d com.apple.ResourceFork \" & quoted form of (POSIX path of theTargetFilePathname) & \"; exit 0\"\n    do shell script theTargetExecutable & \" \" & theTargetIcon & \" \" & quoted form of (POSIX path of theTargetFilePathname)\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set locked of theTargetFilePathname to true\n\nend tell\n\nNotes:\nFor the purpose of this example code, I've placed the setfileicon command line utility and target icon.icns files in the bin folder within the root of my Home folder. The icon.icns file is the .icns file of the one linked in your question. You could use the PNG file, however I believe the .icns file produces a better image.\nThe script could be more hard coded and not as verbose, however I coded it this way for a few reasons of which I'm not going to get into the details of unless you need it explained. Feel free to utilize the example code to implement a working solution as needed/wanted in your environment.\nThis was tested this under macOS Sierra 10.12.5, however it should also work under OS X El Capitan 10.11.6. \n\nA: Actually there is a solution.  I downloaded the .icns file from the link you provided. I then dragged the entire .icns file from the Finder window to the icon image in the Get Info window of the script which I created in Script Debugger app.  After the new icon was set, I selected the option to “lock file” in the Get Info window.\n\nAfter this, I opened that script again in Script Debugger app and made a few changes to the script, recompiled the script and re-save it.  When I tried to save it again, I got this message window.\n\nI selected the option to “Save Ayway” and BINGO!! The edits were saved but the custom icon remained unchanged.\n\nHere is a suggestion that maybe somebody can grab the ball and run with it.  Instead of saving it as a script file in script debugger, save it as a script bundle (.scptd).  After doing this, ctrl + click on that file in finder and select “Show Package Contents”.  Add your custom .icns file to the Resources folder. You'll also notice an info.plist file. Open the info.plist file in Xcode.  If you hit the + button on the information property list row, it gives the option to add icon files.\n\nThis is above the scope of my knowledge but maybe somehow the custom icons file can be set here.\n\nA: I just want to add some information about what's happening.\nWhen you copy and paste a custom icon onto a file in the Finder, what happens is the following:\n\n*\n\n*An 'icns' resource with resource ID kCustomIconResource (-16455) is written to the resource fork of the file in question.\n\n*The Finder sets the kHasCustomIcon bit in the HFS+ FileInfo.finderFlags info for the file in question.\n\nBoth of those things must be done to establish a custom icon. You mentioned that each time you re-pasted the custom icon onto the .scpt file, its file size increased. What that tells me is that the original custom icon 'icns' resource is still in place in the file after Script Debugger saves it, but what's most likely happened is that the kHasCustomIcon bit for the file has gotten lost. When you copy and paste a new icon onto the file it adds another icns entry in the resource fork and also sets that kHasCustomIcon bit so it registers as having a custom icon.\nThe best solution to this problem would simply be to restore the kHasCustomIcon bit for the file rather than re-pasting a whole new icon. This should keep the file size the same.\nHere is a look at the com.apple.FinderInfo for a script that has a custom icon:\nuser@MacBookPro15 ~ % xattr -lx /Users/mdouma46/Documents/Scripts/Leaf\\ to\\ HTML.scpt \ncom.apple.FinderInfo:\n00000000  6F 73 61 73 54 6F 79 53 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |osasToyS........|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020\n\nYou'll notice that first is osas, which is the HFS+ file type, then ToyS, which is the HFS+ creator code of Script Editor. That makes up the following in hexadecimal:\n6F 73 61 73 54 6F 79 53 04\no  s  a  s  T  o  y  S  \n\nNotice that trailing 04? That's the custom icon bit being set.\nIf you have an existing script with a custom icon, save a copy of it that you won't edit to use as a source of \"good\" com.apple.FinderInfo info. You can copy the com.apple.FinderInfo from one file to another using xattr like the following:\nxattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \"`xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /path/to/example/file`\" /path/to/file/to/fix\n\nEDIT: I've just confirmed that this is indeed what's happening as I can see in ResKnife. There are duplicate icns entries, one for each time you paste a custom icon resource onto the file:\n\n", "Q: fsck_hfs keeps returning \"The volume was modified\" I have a iMac (Late 2013) which has a standard 1TB 7200 RPM hard drive. Long story short, I noticed a dramatic slowdown in Windows (in Bootcamp) and on the Mac. After installing DriveDx, it reported that I had around 8,600 Reported Uncorrectable Errors. To my knowledge, that essentially means bad blocks/sectors. \nAfter looking at this post, I followed the fsck_hfs commands. I actually checked for bad blocks first using the /sbin/fsck_hfs -S /dev/disk0s2 and then ran the /sbin/fsck_hfs -drfy /dev/disk0s2 command. \nAfter running the check Debug, Repair, Force command five times, all it would return is \"The volume was modified\" which to my research says that it is not complete, and that you should run it again.\nA couple of questions. Does this command actually do anything to fix bad blocks? And if not, is there another command to actually fix the problem?\nThanks.\n\nA: Your disk is failing.\nTo answer your questions - yes, it attempts to rescue the data and mark the bad blocks so they won't be used in the future and no, there is no command to fix bad blocks.  Bad blocks are physical problems on the storage media.\nThe -S option, per the man page (man fsck_hfs):\n\nCause fsck_hfs to scan the entire device looking for I/O errors.  It\n  will attempt to map the blocks with errors to names, similar to the\n  -B option.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nWhen you run fsck_hfs, it attempts to repair the file system - there's no guarantee that it fixes it.\nIn a previous post, I referenced that the hard drive in the iMac generally has a 3 year warranty (2 years after 2012) so basically, you're about 4 to 5 years into a drive expected to last about 3.  Chances are, it's failing.\nI suggest replacing the drive.\n\nA: If the drive is failing, zeroing it may stress it even further causing total failure and data loss. It is a big risk, but you sometimes a reformat will buy a few weeks of time before the errors return. Make sure you back everything up as soon as possible. Since it probably a physical problem with drive any fix in the disk utility will be like a band-aid. It will try to skip the bad block but the disk will continue to deteriorate.\n", "Q: How to disable / change the photoshop cc splash screen (on Mac) When you open photoshop cc on mac you get this image: Photoshop CC Splash screen\nI want to disable it, or (if impossible) to change it to my own image.\nI know that is not something you can do by just change some pereference but i'm sure there is some kind of a hack that will do it...\nThanks.\n\nA: https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2043396 This maybe?\nOr\nSearch the Photoshop Libraries for Image files.

But recently, I've noticed something, there is a distinction between Anonymous and \"Unknown\", when missing a call.\nWho can tell me what \"unknown number\" means, I suppose a caller either has the number hidden (anonymous) or shown (just the number that shows up, or a contact)? I also received a voicemail from the unknown number, which is just a 3 second message with a computer voice.\nWho can clear this up for me?\n\nA: Unknown means the carrier didn't send a CID response.  Anonymous means they populated it with the word 'Anonymous'.\n", "Q: Free space on hard drive going up and down too much On my laptop with macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (but it was happening with previous versions of the OS too), I get pinged by the system that I have only a few GBs left, I clean up, reboot, go from 4 GB left to 30 GB left, and within a couple of days, not doing anything special (not downloading movies or anything space-hungry), I get told again I have only 4 GB left ...

Any idea or pointers to what I should look at on my HDD to try and understand this? (sleep images, sparse bundles...)\nNote: this question is not about using a disk inventory app to find the large files that take up too much space on my HDD. What I am interested in is why I got from 30 GB after boot to 4 GB without installing anything on my Mac. I want to understand which process is doing that and stop it. \n\nA: Install Homebrew (www.brew.sh)\nIn the teminal, use this command to install ncdu\nbrew install ncdu\n\nthen, run it\ncd ~; sudo ncdu\n\nYou will get a nice overview of the size of all folders in your home directory, largest topmost. It should be easy to track your gigabytes.\nIf this does not give results, you can run ncdu for your whole disc as well. Just go to /Volumes/DISKNAME e.g.\ncd /Volumes/MACBOOT; sudo ncdu\n\nYou should also make sure that no application is simply \"eating ram\" by running\ntop -o mem\n\nIn the top lines, if there are applications that have a \"G\" in the \"mem\" column, they use gigabytes of ram.

I have iPad and I recently installed iOS 11 beta 1 on my iPad. Now I see some battery issues and I want to downgrade to iOS 10.3.2. But I checked on the internet and shows that a PC is compulsory. I don’t have a PC.\n\nA: It's impossible without a PC or a Mac to initiate the wipe and also host the reinstall image download and USB control during the downgrade. \nIn addition to the \"computer\" - you need an Apple tool like iTunes (Mac or PC) or Xcode or Apple Configurator (or a third party one like Ground Control) to reload the older OS, since there is no OTA bundle for downgrading. \n\nA: Need a computer. You can download ipsw file on PC or Mac from https://ipsw.me, and restore iPhone with the ipsw firmware by using iTunes. Or use system recovery tools to install ipsw without iTunes.\nBy the way, iOS 11 beta is only for the developer, not ready for common users now. iOS 11 beta is less buggy but still has many problems.

I have an external FireWire-disk directly connected to a computer for backups using Time Machine. So far, these backups have been unencrypted but now I want to start encrypting my backups (the current backup history should be left as is) but when I try to do that, after entering a password, TM displays a pretty scary dialog (my translation) \"Are you sure you want to erase the volume 'Backup' that is currently used for backups? All information on the disk will be deleted and this can not be undone. If you want to enable encryption and use the disk for Time Machine it must first be erased\".\nWhy is that? I thought TM used disk images for encrypted backups, why not just create one of them and ignore the rest of the content of this disk? Is there a way around this? I have tried renaming the Backups.backupdb-folder but it didn't change anything.\n\nA: According to Apple's support documentation, you need to remove the disk and re-add it as an encrypted disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Time Machine.\n\n*Click Select Disk or Add or Remove Backup Disk (if you have multiple backup disks).\n\n*Select your backup disk, then click Remove Disk.\n\n*Set up the disk again as an encrypted backup disk.\n\n\nA: Time Machine uses a disk image if you are backing up over the network (e.g. to a file server, Time Capsule, or something like that); if you opt to encrypt these backups, it uses an encrypted disk image. If you are backing up to a directly connected volume (e.g. FireWire), it just stores the backup files in a folder (backups.backupdb) on the volume; if you opt to encrypt these backups, it encrypts the entire volume (by formatting it in the Mac OS Extended (journaled, encrypted) format).\nThis means that if you want an encrypted (direct-connect type) backup, you need to encrypt not just the backup, but anything else on the backup volume. If you want some of the disk to store unencrypted files, you'd need to partition it into two volumes (and encrypt just one of them).\nThe good news is that it should be possible to convert the existing volume to the encrypted variant of Mac OS Extended without deleting its contents. This should leave your backup history intact. To do this, secondary-click (right-click or Control-click) on the backup volume's icon in the Finder, and choose 'Encrypt \"<volumename>\" from the shortcut menu. It'll prompt for a password and hint, then begin converting the volume over to encrypted format. The volume will still be usable during the conversion, except for a short period when it's unmounted and then remounted in the new format. You can even unmount, shut down, sleep, etc as it encrypts, but all of these will pause the encryption process (until you remount/restart and mount/wake/whatever) and your data is not fully protected until the encryption process has finished.\nWarning: I haven't tested this very extensively. I did a quick test on a spare computer, and after conversion it recognized the entire backup history & seamlessly added new snapshots to the backup. But there's a possibility it might not always work, so I can't make any promises.\n\nA: Here is my \"experiment\" on that process and result...\nIf you right-click on a Time Machine volume, Apple idiotically gives you the option to encrypt it, although this option is correctly missing from other inappropriate drives. \nThere is no message about what will happen or progress bar, but it changed my SSD's volume file system to APFS, making the volume unusable by Time Machine (which must use the old Mac OS Extended, Journaled file system format). It does not erase your previous backup data, at least. But why Apple would give users an incorrect process and lead them into this losing situation is something Microsoft would have done in the 1990s.\nBut let's say you want to have an APFS volume of old TM backups you no longer want to backup to. Then Apple should at least pop up a message explaining that's what is going to result.\n\nA: I know the question now dates back a little. However, I ran into the same need (how to keep my former time machine backups safe (i.e. stored on an encrypted device) and keep on running time machine incremental backups on top of them).\nIf you're time machine backups are on an external HFS+ drive, you can encrypt such drive without reformating.\nFrom the command line:\ndiskutil cs convert /Volumes/myTimeMachineExternalStorage -passphrase myPassphrase\n\nTime machine will then keep on running seamlessly on the same drive, which will now be encrypted.\n", "Q: Finder Plugins (was Launchd Configuration Puzzle) New information: \nI've realized that what I'm looking for are finder plugins (I should have realized that sooner), even though the parent PID is launchd.

It shows that I've removed applications but forgotten to remove the plist files that are still attempting to launch them.\n\n\nA: The Finder extensions you are looking for are stored within their parent application bundles.\nFor example the Dropbox extension (called garcon.appex) is stored within the Dropbox application bundle at /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/PlugIns/garcon.appex (assuming Dropbox is installed to your default Applications folder).\nIf you open Activity Viewer, select Finder, click on the Information icon and select the \"Open Files and Ports\" tab you can see everything that is loaded into the Finder process.

I have used Windows & Linux for a long time in the past and no matter how slow the system becomes (this actually applies almost only to Windows), the UI is usually snappy if the system is not busy executing multiple background tasks. For example, if I click on a Window or hit Alt-Tab, the switch is almost immediate (unless of course, the application executes some tasks when its window is activated). However, this is not the case with my Mac and a simple click on even the Finder window takes between 500ms to 1000ms to take effect. This is always the case no matter how busy or free my Mac is.

You can do so by using spotlight (the magnifying class in the upper right hand corner), or by pressing Command+Space at the same time. Just type \"Activity Monitor\" and an option should pop up. This lets you see the CPU usage by process, as well at RAM being utilized, and a lot of other good metrics. This should help you get a good idea of what might be slowing down your machine.\n\nA: Yep, certainly not normal. In my experience Macs are almost always more responsive than Windows PCs under nearly any load as long as memory (RAM) isn't full.\nMacs also don't go on \"disk rampages\" like PCs tend to, which always hits the PC with a load of latency every time it goes into a fit of disk access, so overall responsiveness should be much superior.\n", "Q: Can't connect to L2TP over IPSec VPN from Mac 10.12.4 Have troubles with connecting to my VPN from Mac.\nUsing default Mac client, pre-shared secret.\nAlso this works well on iOS 10.3.2 from the same Wi-Fi network.\nFirewall is disable, no Little Snitch.\nmacOS error message says 'The L2TP-VPN server did not respond'\nAlso, I've tried to connect open free VPN, us.freel2tpvpn.com and got no response again, so I think it's a macOS problem, not the server / routing.\nDo you have any ideas?\nHere is my /var/log/ppp.log\nTue Jun 13 15:34:58 2017 : publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success!\nTue Jun 13 15:34:58 2017 : publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success!\nTue Jun 13 15:34:58 2017 : l2tp_get_router_address\nTue Jun 13 15:34:58 2017 : l2tp_get_router_address 172.16.21.1 from dict 1\nTue Jun 13 15:34:58 2017 : L2TP connecting to server '86.102.88.210' (86.102.88.210)...\nTue Jun 13 15:34:58 2017 : IPSec connection started\nTue Jun 13 15:35:03 2017 : IPSec connection failed\n\nupdate 1\nchecked udp ports 500, 1701, 4500 — all open from mac\nupdate 2 \nset up another l2tp ipsec preshered secret server on windows and got same result — don't respond on mac, connected on iphone\nupdate 3\nwiresharked booth on 'connections', and there is no udp packets from mac on connection, but test packets are ok.\ndefinitely the mac vpn client is broken (firewall is off), where should I dig?\n\nA: First step: Ensure that outgoing L2TP connections work properly.

I have exchange configured on my iphone from previous employer. Is it possible to retrieve messages? i am sure iphone stores the downloaded messages somewhere on the phone.\n\nA: There are a number of third-party utilities that allow you to browse through and extract the information stored in a backup of an IOS device. A quick perusal of those programs from a google search seem to show no mention of recovering email. All list SMS/Text messages, calendar, address book, notes but none mention email specifically.\nSince most email on the IOS device is set up as IMAP the email is actually stored on the server. Perhaps the backups that iCloud or iTunes make doesn't include this cached data? I am unsure of this but from my cursory search it does not look good.\nYou may want to find the support pages of some of these tools (iExplorer is a popular tool) and ask that question there. Otherwise it doesn't look good.\n", "Q: Music won't sync onto iPhone: \"Item Not Available\" When I go into the Music app on my iPhone 6, many of the songs in my library are grayed out.

When I click on it, it disappear but again come back in a second. Can anyone please tell me what it is and why is it blinking? Thanks!\n\nA: Unless I am mistaken, this double screen icon is the screen-sharing indicator. This is what it looks like for me in Sierra.\n\nI can't tell you why its blinking or disappearing, but if you can click on it, you should have the option to see which IP address is connected, and an option to disconnect them. If your computer is managed by someone/some entity (work or school), I would go to their IT office and ask them why this is appearing or if they know anything about it.\nIf you own and are the only person in control of your computer, then I would suggest you change your User password immediately.

I'm having a problem with the notes app and/or the calendar app. Is there a way to force an update/replace of either of these apps.  Maybe that will solve my problem.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple does not offer any method of replacing or updating individual default applications. The only way to do this would be to perform a reinstall. Your issue is certainly unusual, but a reinstall will most likely take care of it.

However it isn't configured to be used:\n\nFrom what I understand this is called \"Open Directory\". I don't need it for the work I'm doing. How do I start the computer with the \"normal\" Mac OS X?\nI do not have a way to go past the prompt.\nI couldn't find anything online about this.\n\nA: In my opinion - as a SysAdmin/Mac supporter - this is a really bad hack and it is not recommended. But it works!\nYou probably can forcefully unbind your Mac and reconfigure it by using the .AppleSetupDone method. This may \"poison\" the Open Directory though, because your Mac isn't properly unbound from the disconnected/non-reachable OD server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot to Single User Mode with cmdS\n\n*Enter /sbin/fsck -fy\n\n*Enter /sbin/mount -uw /\n\n*Enter rm -r /Library/Preferences/DirectoryService/\n\n*Enter rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nOn the first attempt this didn't work for me – I got some override root messages. Simply enter yes then. This doesn't remove the files/folder in question though. I repeated the last three steps but accidentally entered /sbin/mount -rw / (which doesn't mean read-write but read-only followed by a read/write) as first command.\n\n\n*Enter /sbin/mount -rw / (/sbin/mount -w / should also work but that's unclear)\n\n*Enter rm -r /Library/Preferences/DirectoryService/\n\n*Enter rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nAfter a reboot (shutdown -r now) you should get the Config Assistant and create a new local admin account.\n\nAfter setting up the new admin user, open System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options > Network Account Server. You probably have to remove any listed OD to properly work with your local admin account.\n\nA: The network accounts are related to open directory, but to show the \"normal\" MacOS login page, you don't actually need to disable it. Go to System Preferences -> Users & Groups. You will see this image (except your Username will be highlighted):\n\nClick on Login Options. If the padlock bottom left is closed, almost everything will be greyed out (like it is now). If the lock is closed and you do not have administrative privileges on your computer, you will want to talk to your IT department.

We then follow these steps.\nDo you have a local user account or a Network account? If you have a local account, you should be able to type in your username and password to get past the prompt. If you have a network account, try connecting to wifi (I think there is a wifi icon in the top right corner you can use without logging in, or plug in an ethernet cable. Then log in with your network account.

The monitor seems to know that it is connected to a device and shows a message saying that there is no signal coming from the computer.\nIs it possible that there is some setup I need to do, or is there a compatibility issue between the display and cable? Or is it possible the cable is no good? Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I used the Star Tech USB to DisplayPort Cable to a similar model monitor, and it worked.\nOn 1 monitor I had to manually change the DP version.\n\nA: On my old monitor Dell U3014, I needed to go to the settings of the monitor (not the laptop) and turn on the DisplayPort 1.2 support which is for some reason disabled by default. To make things worse, the local menu (and not just the input source) on this monitor becomes available only after some valid signal is already coming. Connect some other video source temporarily to it.\nMy mac is MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017), OS 10.13.3 (17D102), cable Delock 85256 USB C.  The display is Dell U3014, it worked fine with various computers for many years and still does.\nHDMI to USB C adapter works with this monitor out of box but for some reason produces really low quality image (something wrong with colours).\nSummarising, DisplayPort 1.2 must be supported by the cable and monitor, and also activated on the monitor side.\n\nA: I had this problem, and after it driving me to the brink of insanity for a couple of weeks, trying all different methods and losing tons of time, I found this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-DisplayPort-Adapter-Thunderbolt/dp/B01K51GM46/ref=sr_1_21?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1501663062&sr=1-21&keywords=macbook+pro+displayport+2017\nSo, Apple basically changed the 2017 version in some way compared to the 2016 one.

I am trying to hook a dragonfly dac to my iPad Air using the lightning to USB3 camera adapter kit.\nWhen powering the camera adapter kit using a backup battery supply that outputs 5V/1000ma, the dragonfly will not work and the iPad says that it draws too much power and will not output sound through the lightning port.\nWhen I use the same configuration but plug the lightning power cable into an electrical outlet, everything works and the DAC captures and processes the sound.\nI cannot determine how large a power supply I would need to have the iPad keep working with the dragonfly plugged into the camera adapter kit.\n\nA: The iPad Air comes with a 11.73 W charger (2.3 A at 5.1 V), so I would go for at least that much.\n\n", "Q: Folders and files are overlapped by menu in Finder I have been a Windows user my whole life and just purchased my very first Apple product ever: a MBP.\nI have a question regarding Finder, which may be a bug or simply me who doesn't know how to use it properly.\nAnyways, here's the (potential) problem: when I am using Finder in split screen mode sometimes folders and files are overlapped by the upper menu.\nCheck this out:\n\nAs you can see in the image above, some folders are now 'under' the upper menu and I cannot seem to be able to get them back in 'visible' positions.\nCan someone advise if this is a bug or it's just me being newbie?\nThanks :)\n--- UPDATE\nI am on MacOS 10.12.5 - the scroll bar is 'fully scrolled up' already.\nI can't drag folders or files - when I release the mouse button, they simply stay in their original position. \nThe problem occurs in all folder view modes.\n--- UPDATE II\nI don't have 'none' or 'snap to grid' as options in the 'sort by' dropdown:\n\nOr in the 'arrange by' dropdown:\n\nThe 'clean up' entries in the view menu are disabled:\n\nOne thing I forgot to mention: the sidebar also gets 'swallowed' by the upper menu:\n\n'Documents', 'Desktop', 'Google Drive', 'Air Drop', etc., are also hidden by the upper menu. \n\nA: It's most likely a Problem with automatic sorting and cleanup in the Grid Display. Look at the general Info Pages from Apple Support here and here about customizing your Display Settings. \nIn Short: Right-click (if it is activated) on the Finder Window and change the 'sort by' Option and activate the cleanup. You probably have the Option 'Snap to Grid' activated - try deactivating it.\n-- Addendum --\nAs a second option, try deleting the '.DS_Store'-Files, which store Icon Positions and Images (see further explanation here). If that doesn't help there are a few other possibilities, but let's start with the easiest one\nLike all Files starting with a dot [.] these are invisible. You have to use the Terminal.app, found in /Applications/Utilities/ do remove them. Technically, you need only remove the .DS_Store-File in the Folder \"Canada\" according to your Screenshot.\nOpen the Terminal and navigate to the Folder, f.e. within 'Documents'\ncd /Users/yourusername/Documents/Canada\n\nhit enter, the type \nrm .DS_Store\n\nYou should close the Folder \"Canada\" and then reopen it again.

Would it work over HDMI? Would it work over DisplayPort? Is the adapter I have suitable?\n\nA: Answer is yes with the right USB C to DP adapter. I have a 2015 MacBook and I have tried it with two very different 4K displays - one Philips, one LG - and both worked correctly at 4K 60Hz. If fact, they work in Bootcamp, too at 4K 60hz.

Open the Bootcamp Assistant application, choose \"Remove Bootcamp Partition\", and then follow the steps. This will delete the bootcamp partition and restore your internal drive to a single partition (Macintosh HD).\nIf you have already erased the contents of the bootcamp partition and are just trying to delete the partition, there is a different set of steps.In this case, open Disk Utility and select \"APPLE SSD SD025...\".

I generated an IPA file using a signing identity that qualifies for App Store submission.\nI sent my client this IPA file but macOS won't open it. It claims that this file comes from an unidentified developer. While there is a workaround by option-clicking the file, I want to know how a client can set Gatekeeper to trust all app files signed by a given identity.\nIt is likly that the client is running Mountain Lion or Sierra.\n\nA: You've signed the IPA with an App Store distribution certificate, then not distributed through the App Store, so the certificate is invalid in the eyes of Gatekeeper and the file will be blocked. Use ad-hoc distribution if you wish to send the IPA file manually. Either way, macOS won't run IPAs as they're iOS app bundles.\n", "Q: Cannot Access Existing Recovery Partition - Early 2011 MacBook Pro I have an Early 2011 Macbook Pro. I need to access the recovery partition for several reasons, such as turning off \"SIP\". Until now, every time I pressed \nCMD+R during booting, it went directly to the internet recovery mode. That has never been a problem for me until now. \nAs you can see from this picture the partition exists : \n\nHowever, not only it doesn't start with CMD+R. It also doesn't show as an option when I press opt . So I went in disk utility, run first aid and got the following output :\nSo I followed the instructions, went to (internet) recovery mode once again, and tried to fix it. Now this is the interesting part, according to the disk utility on internet recovery mode, there are no problems. \nHowever, when I tried to mount the recovery partition (disk0s3) it failed.

Absent someone accessing my physical phone, are there reasonable ways this number could show in my history?\n\nA: Sometimes when wanting to chat with someone I accidentally press the FaceTime option instead of a traditional phone call. Perhaps you might have done so at some point? Or maybe it will log if another person attempted to call you (accidentally) and then hung up?\nThe other possibility is iCloud syncing Call history. Since iMessage and FaceTime don’t affect the carrier - Apple could sync that history if iCloud is signed in on two devices. \nLastly, handoff could also be in play. Again - look at the iCloud accounts on all devices such as Mac and iPad and iPhone. \n", "Q: I want to create a program with Automator and youtube-dl I want to create an app with Automator on macOS Sierra (MacBook Pro 2012) which fetches the URLs of all pages opened in Google Chrome and add them to a function that I've  created based on youtube-dl.\nThe function named go:\nfunction go {\n    youtube-dl \"$1\" \"$2\" \"$3\" \"$4\" \"$5\" \"$6\" \"$7\" \"$8\" \"$9\" \"$10\" \"$11\" \"$12\" \"$13\" \"$14\" \"$15\" \"$16\" \"$17\"\n}\n\nThe URLs of the pages should replace the variables $1 $2 .....\n\nA: The AppleScript example code, shown below, does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If Google Chrome is running, creates a list of every tab of every window.\n\n*Looks for \"YouTube\" in the title of every tab of every window in the list.\n\n*If the title of a tab contains \"YouTube\", it adds the URL of that tab to a list of URLs.\n\n*If the list of URLs is not empty, it changes directory to the Downloads folder and then downloads the video of each URL in the list of URLs, one at a time.\n\n*If the list of URLs is not empty, it displays a notification when the downloading starts, and again when finished. \n\n\n\non run\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        if running then\n            set theseURLs to {}\n            set theSearchString to \"YouTube\"\n            set theWindowList to every window\n            repeat with thisWindow in theWindowList\n                set theTabList to every tab of thisWindow\n                repeat with thisTab in theTabList\n                    if theSearchString is in (title of thisTab as string) then\n                        set end of theseURLs to (URL of thisTab as string)\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n            end repeat\n        else\n            tell current application\n                display notification \"Google Chrome is not open!\"\n                return\n            end tell\n        end if\n    end tell\n    tell current application\n        if theseURLs is not {} then\n            display notification \"Downloading YouTube Video...\"\n            repeat with thisURL in theseURLs\n                do shell script \"cd \\\"$HOME/Downloads\\\"; ./youtube-dl -q --no-warnings \" & quoted form of thisURL\n            end repeat\n            display notification \"YouTube Video Downloading Finished.\"\n        end if\n    end tell\nend run\n\nThis AppleScript code can be used in an AppleScript application or a Run AppleScript action in an Automator application.\nNote: The above example code does not employ all possible forms of error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways how to achieve an objective such as downloading a YouTube video from each YouTube tab in Google Chrome using youtube-dl. The onus is always upon the User to add/use appropriate error handling as needed/wanted. This would include using try statements and on error handlers as/where appropriate. Although, as presently coded, it should run okay without that level of error handling.\nIf this example code is not acceptable in lieu of your go function, then you can modify the code as needed/wanted to accomplish the end goal of downloading every YouTube video of every tab of every window in Google Chrome that has \"YouTube\" in the title (which this code already does).\nThe PATH passed to a do shell script command is /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin, and if youtube-dl is not in that PATH, then include the fully qualified pathname to the executable. As coded in the example code, I have it in my Downloads folder and because I first change directory to there, all I needed to do is preface it with: ./\nAlso as coded, because it's searching the title of each tab for \"YouTube\", if the URL is not in the form of, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=, it will download all videos on that YouTube page. In other words, if it's in the form of e.g. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=, then it going to do lots of downloading from that page.\nIf that's an issue, then change the following lines of code as shown:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change: set theSearchString to \"YouTube\"\n\n*To: set theSearchString to \"youtube.com/watch\"\n\n*Change: if theSearchString is in (title of thisTab as string) then\n\n*To: if theSearchString is in (URL of thisTab as string) then\nThen only the URLs in that form of the URL are added to the list of URLs to be downloaded.\n", "Q: How do I disable screen dimming *only during sunset*?

The problem is being able to print to the Brother printer on an every day basis. I can print from any device one minute, wait an hour or two and can't print. What is the problem with the connectivity issues to the printer.  I've checked with our Cox internet provider, help people at Brother, and with the people at Arris. No one has a solution that works. I hate to buy a new modem-router but is that my only choice with this Arris product.  \n\nA: You haven't specified your Brother printer, but there is a known issue that affects how some of Brother's printers communicate with macOS systems. When I say it's a known issue, you'll be hard pressed to find it documented in writing, although you will have this confirmed if you get the right Brother support person on the phone.\nThere are some workarounds you can try, but these are not guaranteed to work 100% of the time. The only option I've found that will work 100% of the time (based on my experience with a limited number of networks using Brother printers), is to disable IGMP snooping. However, if your modem/router does not provide configuration settings for IGMP, then you'll have to purchase one that does.\nSo, your options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable IGMP snooping if your modem/router supports this\n\n*Try connecting to the Brother printer using CUPS (i.e. do not use AirPrint when you add the printer to macOS)\n\n*Use your modem/router to allocate a static IP address to the printer (using the printer's MAC Address1 to identify it) and also configuring the printer's network settings to give it the IP address you've set at the modem/router end\n\n*Connect the printer via USB cable instead of Wi-Fi to your MBP when printing\n\n\nIf you still get no joy, then your best bet (assuming you want to keep using the Brother printer) is to purchase a modem/router that supports IGMP and ensure you disable IGMP snooping.\nRegardless of what you opt for, I strongly suggest you actually reset the printing system on your MBP before trying each of the above options. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Got to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on the Printers & Scanners preference pane\n\n*Right-click on the list of printers on the left-hand side and select Reset printing system... \n\n*At the next prompt, click on the Reset button\n\n\nRemember: Make sure when you add the printer back that you use the CUPS option and not the AirPrint option. (Don't worry, you should still be able to print to your Brother printer from your iPhone and iPad).\n1Not to be confused with your Mac computer. See MAC address for more info. You can obtain your printer's MAC address from its configuration menu.\n", "Q: How to add a user from the command line in macOS?

There isn't a manual but /usr/sbin/sysadminctl -h is explanatory. You should be aware that the command and options will be stored in your shell's history. Note the last line of the help output so that the user password is not stored in your shell's history.\n\nA: Update: A better explanation of what I answered can be found here. Please use that information instead.\nORIGINAL: macOS doesn't have the same unix commands as Linux. To add a user, properly use the system preferences pane for Users & Groups.\nSystem Preferences will have a Users & Groups section. There you can click the + icon in the bottom left to add a user as standard or administrator.\nmacOS uses a directory service to administrate users. The adduser command equivalent for Mac is:\ndscl . -create /Users/USERNAME_HERE\n\nYou may need admin privledges, therefore sudo will be needed like so\nsudo dscl . -create /Users/USERNAME_HERE\n\nFollowed by a long chain of commands to set up that user properly.

From the man page:\n uncache service-name\n          This subcommand instructs launchd to bypass its service cache\n          for the named service and instead read the service's configu-\n          ration file directly from disk.  launchd maintains an in-mem-\n          ory cache of XPC service configuration files to minimize the\n          disk I/O.

I leave my watch at home when I go to work, because my work poses too many threats for it, and it seems the battery dies faster in this situation.  I assume it's because the watch is looking for the phone.  Anyone else experience this?  Are there any settings to change to fix this?\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes, my Series 2 drains faster if it's not connected to iPhone. I put the watch in Airplane mode to save battery when it's not near the iPhone. It lasts much longer.

Another possibility would be to save all your important data and reset your phone and then import all the data back on the phone.\n", "Q: Can't Preview deal with many photos? I've just migrated to Mac from Windows and the adaptation process has been a bumpy ride. I now have a question regarding Preview.\nI just got back from a trip and have some 3GB of photos (DNG) that I have imported into my MBP. I did not use Photos because I am a Lightroom user and I intend to keep using Lightroom in the future (I am still planning on how I will move my LR stuff from my Windows PC to the MBP). \nYesterday I wanted to show my girlfriend the pictures, so I opened all of them using Preview. The application crashed after one minute of usage. I tried again, and one more time the application crashed.\nI did some googling and found a suggestion that I could go to the Library folder and trash a few Preview related files. I decided to give this idea a spin and ditched them. I fired up Preview again, used for a couple of minutes and.... it crashed. \nI am now wondering if Preview isn't suitable for viewing loads of pictures, or if there is something wrong on my Mac? If not, which software do you guys use (other than Photos and LR)?\n--- UPDATE\nI have a MBP 2015 model running on 8GB of RAM. I didn't have any application open other than Chrome when I tried to use Preview. \n\nA: To the best of my knowledge there is no documented limit to the number of photos you could open at one time using Preview. Usually, when software has no hard-coded limit, the only limitation is that created by the amount of RAM available to the application.\nIn the case of Preview, the more RAM available the more it can take advantage of when opening images. In addition to RAM being a factor, the number of images Preview can open at once also depends on the image format and the individual image sizes.\nYou don't specify how much RAM you have and what else (if anything) you were running at the time, nor do you specify the exact model of MBP etc. However, I've been using Preview for over 16 years and can attest to the fact that in some cases it's only been able to open a few hundred images, while in other cases it's been able to open 1000s.\nMy suggestion would be to start with only opening a hundred at a time and if it handles that without problems, double it to 200 and so on. You'll soon establish what's comfortable in your scenario.\nA final word\nOne thing to consider also is that if you happen to have a corrupted image file then this could cause problems. I've seen Preview (and other apps) normally capable of opening a large number of files, randomly crash because one of the files you're trying to open is damaged in some way. Likewise, similar problems can be experienced if you've inadvertently selected a file that isn't supported. While these issues aren't usually a problem as Preview would just present you with an error message, it can be a problem if Preview is processing a large number of images simultaneously and is also waiting for a response from the user.\n", "Q: Mac with 2 monitors. How to change screens? My mac is connected to 2 displays. Mac is in the center, one display is in the left and one in the right.\n\nSometimes it happens that when I disconnect and connect my mac from displays, display 1 becomes 3 and 3 becomes 1.\nIf I change their location inside Display section in System Preferences location becomes correct but all icons from display 1 stays on display 3. The same for display 3 whose icons are on 1.\nIs it possible to fix this without relocation of physical monitors?\n\nA: One thing you could try is resetting the NVRAM of your Mac to see if that resolves this.\nYou don't specify the model of your Mac, so below are some generic steps that will work to reset the NVRAM on all Mac models:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\n\nA: Make sure you are plugging in the monitors in the same ports and in the same order, as the OS will add the displays as they appear.\n", "Q: AppleScript: How to get all window names of processes that share the same title? The process, RSScriptRunner, represents a currently running script that was triggered by FastScripts.app. (FastScripts does not assign unique process titles to scripts that it triggers.)\nIf one has multiple processes titled RSScriptRunner running simultaneously, then the following code:\ntell application \"System Events\" to windows of process \"RSScriptRunner\"\n\nwill only return the window name of the process that began the earliest.\nHowever, I would like to get every window name of every RSScriptRunner process.\nDoes anyone know how to accomplish this in AppleScript?\n\nMy ultimate intent here is to implement a check that ensures that only one instance of one script can run simultaneously. Multiple different scripts running is okay, but multiples of a script running at the same time is undesirable.\nThe code would look something like this:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set theWindowList to windows of process \"RSScriptRunner\"\n    if theWindowList contains \"The title of the initial dialog of this script goes here.\" then\n        error number -128\n    end if\nend tell\n\nThis check would be located at the very top of the script.\n\nNote:\nThis is very much a situation where minimal latency is crucial.\nI had devised a long-winded method that successfully realized my desired outcome. The method entailed getting every current process title into one list, and getting every current process ID into another, corresponding list. I then retrieved the window name of each RSScriptRunner process via its respective process ID (which, unlike the process name, must be unique).\nHowever, this method brought with it a couple seconds of latency. I need a solution that is nearly instant (such as, the line of code above).\n\nA: Note: On my system, macOS Sierra, there is no window for this process.\nYou can use a whose clause, like this:\nFor a process that contains only one window, use this script:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set theWindowList to name of window 1 of (processes whose name is \"RSScriptRunner\")\n    if theWindowList contains \"The title of the initial dialog of this script goes here.\" then\n        error number -128\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\nFor a process that can contain one or more windows, use this script:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set myList to name of windows of (processes whose name is \"RSScriptRunner\") -- get a list of lists, each sublist contains names \nend tell\nset theWindowList to my subListsToOneList(myList) --  Flattening a list of lists\n\nif theWindowList contains \"The title of the initial dialog of this script goes here.\" then\n    error number -128\nend if\n\non subListsToOneList(l)\n    set newL to {}\n    repeat with i in l\n        set newL to newL & i\n    end repeat\n    return newL\nend subListsToOneList\n\n\nThe solution for macOS Sierra, maybe it works for other OSes as well, to get the name of the launched scripts, is to use the ps and pgrep commands.\nset theNameList to paragraphs of (do shell script \"ps -p $(pgrep -x RSScriptRunner) | sed -n 's:.*RSScriptRunner.*/::p'\") -- get the name of the scripts\nif theNameList contains \"the name of this script.scpt\" then error number -128\n\nInformations:\n\n\n*\n\n*$(pgrep -x RSScriptRunner) : A sub shell to get the process ID of\neach instance of the RSScriptRunner, the '-x' option: require\nan exact match of the process name\n\n*ps -p: get the command of each PID (the result contains the path of\nthe launched script).\n\n*The sed command : delete characters from the beginning of the line\nthrough the last slash character to get the name of the script (the\n-noption is to print the line which contains the\n'RSScriptRunner' word only, because the first line is the headers\n--> PID TTY           TIME CMD).\n\n", "Q: Are there known bluetooth LE issues using OSX 10.12.5 that result in missing packet data?

If anyone has any insights please let me know. Thanks so much!\n\nA: The issue of packet loss was due to the different minimum connection intervals allowed on different operating systems and the amount of data my peripheral was attempting to output. Due to the requirements of the project we need fairly high throughput. My original assessment of getting positive and negative results from the same operating system were incorrect due to some confounding variables. The same packet loss was occurring on all mac machines I tested. Greater packet loss was occurring using os x vs using ubuntu because there is a theoretical limit on the minimum connection interval of 20ms for all apple software interfacing with corebluetooth. I'm not sure if ubuntu imposes a similar limit but I was definitely observing less packet loss using ubuntu. My hunch is that there is no artificial limit and the connection interval could have been at the ble minimum of 7.5ms but I will have to do some more research to figure out what the number actually is.\n", "Q: Three monitor set up - how to set one monitor to grayscale? I have a Retina MacBook Pro (mid-2015), powering an Apple Cinema Display 24\" monitor, and a run-of-the-mill, cheap and poor quality/old Samsung monitor. I've connected both of these displays to the RMBP via Thunderbolt.\nNow, since the Samsung monitor is old, I would prefer to use it in grayscale. I'm trying to figure out how to use macOS Sierra to change that, and that monitor only, to grayscale. I would only use it to display information that can be viewed in grayscale (Slack chats, email, Terminal, logs, Mixpanel/Geckoboard analytics, you know, not browse websites). I am well aware that the Accessibility -settings in System Preferences can be applied so that each of the three screens is grayscale. I'm not looking for that. If I was looking for that, I'd just launch a Grayswitcha-app I made with AppleScript.\nI'm looking to set the Samsung, and only the Samsung, to grayscale.\nIs there some way of doing this?\nWould really appreciate any assistance on this.\nPS Not looking for \"change all your apps to be grayscale, and then if you want the same app to be colored too on a different display, do another profile/alias for each and every one of the apps, then run it with the color... oh hang on that's a great deal of work, do it anyway cos this is a good solution\" -type solutions :(\nPPS also not looking for \"solutions\" where i'm told to properly color profile correct the Samsung, If I was, I'd have solved that already by asking a different way. I'm looking to shoot grayscale data at the Samsung and that is really all.\n\nA: I would suggest two options:\nFirstly, check the controls of the monitor itself (usually in some terrible UI with only two buttons) to see if you can de-color the screen somehow.\nThe second is to create custom display profile that would turn the monitor to greyscale. You can't actually select a greyscale profile as the monitor's profile, so you would need to create an RGB version. You could do this in the display calibrator wizard.\n\nA: The solution isn't to use grayscale! The solution is to create correct color profiles for monitors, so that they give correct colors. Just use a display calibrator, and calibrate the profile of both monitors (internal and external), so that the colors show up almost the same in both. (I use an i1 display pro profiler. You can borrow one, or buy a used one, or buy and return if if you do not like it.)\n", "Q: Firefox 54 launched from Dock on Sierra crashes I'm running macOS 10.12.5 Sierra with Firefox 54.0 on a MacBook Air. A Firefox icon is present in the Dock. When launching Firefox from this icon (or double-clicking the icon in the Applications folder), it immediately crashes. However, if I launch it via the command line ($ ./firefox in the app folder), it does not crash. Launching via open -a Firefox also crashes.\nI launched Firefox from the command line in safe-mode and disabled all add-ons, but it still crashes when launched from the icon in the Dock.\nI'm using the new Compact Dark theme. I disabled this and tested again, but Firefox still crashes when launched from the Dock icon.\nRemoving the icon from the Dock and adding it back did not solve this.\nDownloading a fresh copy of Firefox 54.0 and installing over the previous version of 54.0 did not solve this.\nSuggestions to fix this?\nUpdate: This is not resolved in Firefox 54.0.1.\nUpdate: This appears to be resolved in Firefox 55.0.2 (64-bit).\n\nA: Do the following in a terminal:\ncd /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS\n./firefox &\nFirefox 54.0 will launch successfully with all installed add-ons and themes activated.\n", "Q: Faster way to expand submenus using keyboard Consider the nested menus structure (from Intellij) as shown in the screenshot:\n\nUsing the right arrow key will cause the Find submenu to expand. But the right arrow key is inconvenient/slow to reach.  \nIn Linux/Windows the Menu actually opens automatically: is there some faster key combination  - than the awkward ^F2-<E>-<F>-<Right Arrow Key> way to nudge OS/X to \"move along\" a bit faster?\nNote: Intellij has over 150 menu items so comments/answers like \"Why not use Hotkeys?\" are naive/impractical.\n\nA: Why don't you use hotkeys from that menu? ⌘F, ⌘R etc.\nUse Control + ]\n", "Q: Gmail on OSX Right Click Gmail is showing me this menu instead of the regular right-click menu. Particularly, I need \"Open in Tab\" for individual mails.\n\nHow do I get back to the \"regular\" Chrome/Safari right-click menu?\n\n\nA: You can't change the contextual menu (activated by Control Click or \"Right-Click\") because it's embedded within the App; this includes the HTML code of a web page.\nFrom Apple's Developer Documentation\n\nContextual menus pop up when the user Control-clicks or right-clicks\n  over an object. Safari presents different contextual menus when the\n  mouse pointer is over the toolbar, Bookmarks bar, an extension bar,\n  the tab bar, or the contents of a webpage.\nYour extension can add menu items to the contextual menu that pops up\n  over web content. You control the actions of the menu item by\n  installing a listener function for the \"command\" event in either your\n  global HTML page or in an extension bar.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\nEssentially, what this is saying is that the developer of the (web) app sets the contents of the contextual menu.  If they don't set it, it will be the default for whatever is set in Safari/Chrome/Firefox/etc.\nIf your goal is to open a link in a new tab, hold Cmd while clicking to bypass the menu.  Holding Shift while clicking opens the link in a new window.  I have found these options quicker than right clicking as my left hand rarely leaves the keyboard and I don't have to parse through a menu to find the item I want.\n\nA: You can create a bookmarklet to disable non-native contextual menu. \nAdd this code as a bookmark addres:\njavascript:(function(w){\nvar arr = ['contextmenu'];\nfor(var i = 0, x; x = arr[i]; i++){\n    if(w['on' + x])w['on' + x] = null;\n    w.addEventListener(x, function(e){e.stopPropagation()}, true);\n};\nfor(var j = 0, f; f = w.frames[j]; j++){try{arguments.callee(f)}catch(e){}}})(window);\n\nYou'll need to \"open\" it whenever you want to disable the non-native contextual menu. Maybe there's some way of launching this atomatically, but I don't know how to do it.\nCode taken from this StackOverflow answer.\n", "Q: Reconnect to network drive on connection to network I have a NAS and I connect to it as a network drive, however when I leave the house with the MacBook Pro and come back I have to manually remember to reconnect to the network drive. Is there anyway to do this automatically?\nControlPlane is not a solution as it currently has problems with macOS Sierra.\nSystem version: macOS Sierra 10.12.5\n\nA: I've been having the exact same problem and search for a solution. Eventually I found a few apps in the app store (I never normally look for software there!) that claim to be able to reconnect network drives after sleep:\nDrive Mounty - I tried the pro version of this (£2.99) for a few weeks and it seemed to mostly work ok but suddenly started hammering the CPU and failing to mount the drive and also adding random suffixes to the mount point. The free version is restricted to 1 mount point and limited remounts. Was promising at first but sadly became unreliable.\nAuto Mounter - Currently trying this (£9.99) with the Pro options pack too (£2.99). Looks good so far and has lots of features and the ability to create rules. Can mount drives in /Volumes using a separate helper utility that overcomes the App Store sandboxing. It's a shame there is no free trial version available.\nDrive Mounter - Not tried this because Auto Mounter is holding up well so far. Has a free version too to try.\nIf you try any of these let me know how they work out.\n\nA: I had the same problem as the OP.  But I didn't want to have to add any apps.\nSo I use osascript to mount the file system.  This solution does require you to save the credentials in the Keychain, but that only needs to be done once.\nfirst I created the script file (credit to samuelfullerth for writing the script)\n nano ~/automount.sh\n\nThen I put in this script (with changes to fit my environment)\nif /sbin/ping -q -c 1 -W 1 <server ip goes here> >/dev/null; then\n  if [ ! -d \"/Volumes/<your volume>\" ]  \n   then\n  /usr/bin/osascript -e \"try\" -e \"mount volume \\\"smb://<your user name@server IP/your volume>\\\"\" -e \"end try\"  \n  fi\nfi\n\nAfter saving I changed the permissions\nchmod 755 ~/automount.sh\n\nThen I created a crontab entry to run the script every minute.  I prefer nano  for editing so I used this command. (there's probably a way to make nano the default)\nenv EDITOR=nano crontab -e \n\nEnter this into the crontab and save\n* * * * * ~/automount.sh >/dev/null 2>&1\n\nNow your Mac will stay connected to the NAS regardless.  I got so tired of my Mac nagging me to reconnect to a drive that should always be connected.\nCheers\n\nA: My solution for this is to use an Automator application, and a remounting script I wrote.\nPart 1: Automating the Action\nUsing the Automator tool, I created a new Application, to which I added in order:\n\n*\n\n*Get Specified Servers action that gets my server (in my case, my raspberry pi)\n\n*Connect to Servers, which connects to the server I've gotten in the prior action. It should look like the below screenshot.\n\n\nPart 2: Checking to see if the computer is connected to the server\nThis automates the action of connecting to the server, but it doesn't automate the reconnection process. For that I wrote a simple script that I run on a cron job that checks (every 10 seconds) if the computer has connected to the server, and if the drive is mounted like I expect it to be.\nThe script checks:\n\n*\n\n*If my computer can ping the server\n\n*If my computer has already mounted the drive in Volumes\n\n*If my computer can ping the server, but the drive is not mounted, it runs the Automator application.\n\nif /sbin/ping -q -c 1 -W 1 <server ip goes here> >/dev/null; then\n  if [ ! -d \"/Volumes/<your volume>\" ]\n    then\n      open /usr/local/bin/remount/mount-drive.app\n  fi\nfi\n\nPart 3: Checking every 10 seconds\nThe final part is in my crontab, to run this script every minute:\n* * * * * sh /usr/local/bin/remount/remount.sh\nThat runs it every minute - if you want it to run every 10 seconds you've got to add in multiple cron jobs to run the script at 10 second intervals, a la:\n* * * * * sleep 10; sh /usr/local/bin/remount/remount.sh\n* * * * * sleep 20; sh /usr/local/bin/remount/remount.sh\n* * * * * sleep 30; sh /usr/local/bin/remount/remount.sh\n* * * * * sleep 40; sh /usr/local/bin/remount/remount.sh\n* * * * * sleep 60; sh /usr/local/bin/remount/remount.sh\nHonestly there is probably an easier way to do this with just Automator - I'm using three things (crontab, a script, and an Automator App) together that I'm sure I could probably just use the Automator App script if I was just better at it!\nThat said, it does the job - when I open up my Macbook, and the drive is disconnected, this makes sure that the computer reconnects within 10 seconds if it can connect to the drive.\n", "Q: 4G signal on phone, but showing LTE on my MacBook Usually, the signal strength on the iPhone is the same with the one shown on my MacBook:\n\n\n\nHowever, in a specific area, between two hills, where the signal is pretty poor, my iPhone shows 1 circle of 4G signal (and the internet does work pretty well on the iPhone), but my MacBook shows 1 circle of LTE signal, and it's very slow.\nIs there any setting that I can change to make the MacBook internet via Hotspot faster?\nWhy is this happening?\n\nA: Reading about 4G vs LTE, I found LTE includes 4G. So, technically it's correct.\nAnd sometimes, even it shows 4G on my MacBook, it's still slow. It seems to be just the naming.\n", "Q: How do I stop emails 'pushing' to Apple Mail (macOS Sierra) I don't want Mail to automatically download new mail.

But email still pushes to my iCloud account!\nDoes anyone know how to change this behaviour so new mail only delivers when I ask the app to fetch it?\nThanks!\nAndy\n\nA: According to this topic:\nDisable the Push IMAP (IDLE) email in macOS Sierra, Apple has removed that option.\n", "Q: Using ARD to do mass upgrades? I am trying to find a method of Upgrading many computers, for example to 10.10.x to 10.12.x . Is there a way of doing so using Apple Remote Desktop? Planning to update about 40 computers. \nI am able to update from 10.12.4 to 10.12.5 but so far I have not made much progress with an upgrade. Would AutoDMG be a step forward without deleting the files already on the computers?\n\nA: You can use Apple Remote Desktop to copy the macOS Installer application to the Applications folder on every client Mac, then send the following UNIX command as root:\n/Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app --agreetolicense --nointeraction\n\nThis command starts the in-place upgrade action to macOS High Sierra. It may take some time for the entire process to complete, but it doesn't require any user interaction.\n\nA: You can build a package and deploy it, but it will not be simple. I would look at using something like JAMF for managing that many computers. \n", "Q: How to get OpenVPN details from macOS to iOS I have a VPN which I connect to on my MacBook with Tunnelblick.

If the USB controller on the external disk takes its power from the USB contact rather than the power supply of the disk (apparently not an uncommon solution), then TM backups fail stochastically bur reproducibly due to dropped connection which show up as I/O errors in the logs. A USB-hub with separate power supply resolves the situation.\n", "Q: iPhone 6, charged overnight and now stuck in bootloop I left my phone charging overnight, and in the morning I woke up and the phone was stuck in bootloop.\nThe Apple logo came on, then the screen turned white, sometimes with 1 black horizontal line or sometimes a pixel (greenish).\n\nA: While the screen is white I would try force restarting.\nIf that doesn't work, and you have a computer and some time, I would force it into DFU mode and restore it with iTunes.\nHOWEVER, do not use DFU mode if you do not have a backup of the phone.

If a Mac is reinstalled by booting in to the recovery partition,\nand the Mac came with El Capitan but was upgraded to Sierra via wifi,\nwhat os will the Mac have after reinstalling via recover mode?\n\nA: Found the answer to my own question:\nThe simple answer is, whenever you perform a major OS X upgrade, the Recovery HD partition is also upgraded to the same version of OS X. So, an upgrade from Lion to Mountain Lion will result in a Recovery HD linked to OS X Mountain Lion.\nsource: https://www.lifewire.com/identify-os-x-version-on-recovery-hd-partition-2259968\n\nA: Josh, it is even better: as soon as you want to (re)install OS from the recovery partition: it installs the actual OS version including the latest update: for example you have 10.12.3 on your mac and you install OS from the recovery partition, it will install 10.12.6\n\nA: Coming from a windows background, this was too good to be true.\nI wanted to check it out myself.\nSo I thought the upgrades are retained in the recovery partition. So I went to a local coffee shop (with slow internet), wiped my disc, and began reinstalling. Indeed the the installer bootstrapper was the latest Sierra version.\nBut it took me more than four hours. Why did it take so long to re-install? Fortunately the installer let's you peek in to the \"activity log\", and I found that despite the claims in the other answers to this question, the installer does actually end up downloading a very large amount of data from apple servers. It calls them chunks and I watched as all 400+ of them downloaded one by one. Mind you, this happened a few days after the recover partition was supposedly given the latest updates.\n", "Q: Sharing my VPN connection on macOS Sierra via WiFi Using MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) with macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73), I have a VPN connection through Pulse Secure on my WiFi, and I would like to share it with my mobile device, so I got a D-Link DWA-131 Nano USB WiFi adapter, and tried to connect through the new adapter to VPN, whilst sharing the connection through AirPort WiFi using Internet Sharing.\nThe sharing works, internet works, but VPN is not shared, only internet connection, so I tried to share my VPN using pfctl but with no luck, I've done it before through Ethernet, but I'm not able to do it through WiFi.\nHere's what I do:\n# sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1\n# sysctl -w net.inet.ip.fw.enable=1\n(this generates sysctl: unknown oid 'net.inet.ip.fw.enable', no idea what is needed)\n# pfctl -d\n# pfctl -f nat-rules -e\n\nMy nat-rules file contains:\nnat on utun1 from en0:network to any -> (utun1)\n\nThis is the only rule, it worked before when I was forwarding VPN from Ethernet to WiFi (different BSD device names of course).\nHave you tried such thing before? It seems that the main problem is around creating a WiFi network without Internet Sharing, which doesn't seem to be possible \n\nA: As a test, I'd try setting things up totally from the macOS GUI rather than using Terminal. You may already know how to do this, but broadly the steps would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your Mac to the internet via your Pulse Secure\n\n*Set up your VPN connection in System Preferences > Network\n\n*Click on the Advanced... button\n\n*Ensure you tick the Send all traffic over VPN connection checkbox\n\n*Click OK\n\n*Ensure you also tick the checkbox for Show VPN status in menu bar\n\n*Now go to System Preferences > Sharing\n\n*Highlight (but do not tick) the Internet Sharing service in the lefthand pane\n\n*On the righthand side, select the VPN connection you created at Step 2 from the Share your connection from drop-down menu\n\n*Now select the Nano USB Wi-Fi port (i.e. tick the checkbox)\n\n*Click on the Wi-Fi Options... button\n\n*Give your new Wi-Fi network a name, password etc\n\n*Click OK\n\n*Now tick the Internet Sharing service in the lefthand pane\n\n\nNow test this to confirm that whenever your Mac is connected to the VPN, it will share the connection via the Nano USB Wi-Fi.

Strangely I could feel clicks in the touch pad (which means there is power and the haptic engine is working) but absolutely nothing else. I tried literally all day, to charge it, uncharge it, pressed the power button 1000 different ways and then nothing. So I got an idea:\nI opened up the computer and unplugged the battery. Then I plugged in the power... Instantly it boots up. It gets stuck in a loop of half loading, crashing and then starting again. So at this point I plug the battery in and everything boots up and seems good. Except... now the keyboard doesn't work. \nSo for almost a week I used an external USB keyboard with my computer, scared to death to let it shut down. Then one day... the keyboard just started working again, everything except the arrow keys and the question mark. The arrow keys came back the next day after randomly pressing themselves a bunch, the question mark never did.\nAnyways, I was OK with my situation, copy pasting a question mark in from the notepad when I needed it. But now this morning I had the black screen again. This time nothing worked at all, except there was music playing and I could turn the volume up and down and skip songs, but nothing else worked (not the keyboard lights, not the power button)... so I unplugged the battery and jump started it again. \nNow my command keys don't work.\nThis is getting incredibly frustrating and I am appalled that this $3000+ machine has so many strange random problems that have nothing to do with physical damage.\nDoes anyone have any idea what's going on?\n\nA: If you still have AppleCare coverage I would contact Apple for support and disregard the rest of this answer\nThere are a few things you could try to troubleshoot this - but you will need to be patient as troubleshooting is often a process of elimination and takes time.\nFor starters, I'd do a NVRAM and SMC reset (in that order). Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nReset the NVRAM on your MBP as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your MBP reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your MBP reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\nThere's a couple of ways you can reset the SMC on your MBP, however I prefer the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your computer to determine if the issues still persist. \nIf you're still having problems, the it's time to test your hardware with Apple Diagnostics.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n\nA: It looks like a faulty battery that has swollen a bit.

Immediately I was told to upgrade the adapter, and I clicked okay and then right through the usual installer screens.

MacBook rebooted, but adapter doesn't work and the upgrade nag no longer shows up.\nI understand now that it's important to plug the power into the slot on the adapter (rather than into your MacBook) when doing the upgrade, and it's a good idea to read the installer ReadMe, but this was not done.\nOpening /System/Library/CoreServices/Firmware\\ Updates/USB-C\\ Multiport\\ Adapter/adapterupdate1.pkg and trying to re-run the upgrader manually fails with the message: \"This software is not supported on your system\".\nSystem Report seems to recognize the USB Multiport adapter, and see's version 2.33, however any devices plugged into the adapter (HDMI, USB) while they register in system report, don't actually work.\nThis is the second adapter that I did this too so I'm pretty sure the issue was related to not being plugged in during the upgrade, but surely there is some way to reset / re-image the damn thing, I'd rather not get a 4th one.\n\nA: Your adapter is not bricked per se.

What's that mean? I'm running MacOS Sierra on a mid-2014 MacBook Pro.  About once/week, Safari’s CPU usage becomes very high, and it becomes very laggy.   In the last instance I had just six windows open, none of which were playing videos, but Safari’s CPU usage was at 332%.  In addition, even after closing all six windows, Safari’s CPU usage remained at a high level.  I could only get it to stop by quitting and restarting Safari. \nI got a Capture Data trace while it was happening, and sent it to AppleCare, where a senior advisor forwarded it to their engineering team.  The response he got back was that it looks like I wasn't rebooting my computer often enough, which is necessary because the kernel expires (he recommends weekly, and I was rebooting it about every two months).  As this was second-hand through the senior advisor, I wasn't able to get a more complete technical explanation.  Further, I've not been able to find any official Apple documentation on this.\nCan anyone give me a detailed technical explanation that elucidates what's actually going on here?  I'm particularly curious if this is something particular to MacOS's microkernel (as opposed to monolithic kernel) design, and whether kernel expiration time is fixed based on wall clock, CPU time, etc. since last reboot, or varies based on certain factors. Thanks!\n[I'll add that, from 2004-2009, I used a Power Mac G5, often running 10 applications w/ 10 windows each, as well as C++ programs that took weeks to finish, never rebooted except when needed for software updates, and got kernel panics less than once/year.  But all three MacBook Pros I've owned (2008, 2011, 2014) have given kernel panics every month or two.  I'm now wondering if this is because I'm not rebooting my MacBook Pros often enough — except this wasn't an issue with the G5.]\nIn case it's helpful, here's a screenshot showing the Activity Monitor during the event described in the first paragraph. Also displayed is the Intel Power Gadget readout; it seems odd that the CPU frequency is only 1.3 GHz (it's a 2.8 GHz Intel i7-4980HQ processor with a 4.0 GHz Turbo Boost) when a process is running at 332%.  This behavior reminds me of (but is of course different from) thermal throttling of the CPU, where the system creates a fictitious high-load kernel task (typically ~>600%) to keep other processes from running, resulting in a low CPU frequency (0.8 GHz) (an example of thermal throttling is shown after).  I didn't post these initially because I thought they might be a distraction from my core question about \"kernel expiration\" and weekly reboots, but have reconsidered given that forum members have disagreed with that explanation.\nHIGH SAFARI ACTIVITY:\n\nTHERMAL THROTTLING OF CPU (FOR COMPARISON):\nThe thermal throttling on my current MacBook Pro is a separate issue from the kernel crashes, since I got the crashes even in the winter when I first got the computer and when there was no thermal throttling, and also got them with my previous two MacBook Pros as well. I've just posted this for comparison. [In case you're curious: The throttling occurs consistently when the discrete video card is being used (4K monitor attached) and the ambient temp reaches 83F; I've never gotten throttling when the monitor is disconnected. The computer is properly-ventilated; it sits on a raindesign mStand. The Apple engineer says it needs to be brought in for service to check the fans for dust, and for possible reapplication of thermal paste.  It's under warranty, but I can't do that until I can arrange for a loaner.]  \n\n\nUPDATE, JUNE 23, 2017:\nI was unable to reconnect with the original AppleCare senior advisor, so I spoke to a new one who took over my case.  He's been with Apple for about a decade, and said the following (I'm paraphrasing):\n1) Weekly reboots. It's too strong to say they're required.  Rather, they represent good practice. MacOS loads as much as possible into RAM to maximize performance and, if your computer doesn't use ECC memory (which only the MacPros do), errors creep in.  Eventually, these can cause a kernel panic. How much time this takes varies greatly depending on your usage pattern. Some can get away with going a long time without panics, others can't. [It's not just how heavy your usage is, but also what you use.  So one heavy user may be fine with infrequent reboots, while another, using different software, may need more frequent ones.]  It's really about risk management.  Rebooting clears the RAM, allowing it to start fresh.  The longer you wait between reboots, the more errors accumulate, and the greater the risk of kernel panics.  While one week isn't a specific guideline — indeed, there are no specific guidelines; you might use, say, two weeks — it's generally held within Apple that regular reboots are a good practice, for the above reasons. If you want to keep that risk at a very low level, weekly reboots are an excellent practice.\n[My one observation: This doesn't explain why I didn't get regular kernel panics with my PowerPC which, while it can take ECC memory, can't make use of the ECC functionality—unless the PowerPC chip itself used memory differently from the Intel chip, even with the same OS.]\nAs to the server farm example that's been raised, this wouldn't be an issue for servers using ECC memory, such as the old Mac XServe.  However the Mac Minis of course do not, so I'm curious how often https://macminicolo.net (mentioned by Matt Holland in a comment below) finds the Mac Minis they host in their server farm need to be rebooted.\n2) Kernel expiration:  He's never heard of this.  He will contact the engineer for clarification, and should report back within about a week. I'll let you know what he says. As part of this, he will try to get a clearer answer on the Safari CPU usage (as I mentioned above, the Apple engineers have an actual data trace of this event, so they have good information on it).\nFINAL REPORT ON \"KERNEL EXPIRATION\" (UPDATED JAN 9, 2018):\nI never got a reply from the new senior advisor about \"kernel expiration.\"  I did some research myself and found that, while it seems there is no such thing as \"kernel expiration\" in OSX, there are (as was also mentioned by Zan Lynx in the discussion, below) \"kernel timers\" that do expire (see http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S174228761500050X ).  So my best speculation is that the Apple Care engineer was referring to kernel timer expiration, and that this somehow got lost in translation (to use Monomeeth's expression) between the engineer and the original senior advisor, thus morphing into \"kernel expiration\" when that senior advisor tried to relay it to me.  Alas,even if so, I don't know why the AC engineer was concerned about this in relationship to my uptime.\nEPILOG (JULY 1, 2018):\nOver the past seven months I've used my Mac both with and without the weekly reboots.  I've found, consistently, that when I do the weekly reboots my Mac behaves well, but when I miss them wonky behavior begins to pop up.  My conclusion is that, while it may not be generally true that Macs require weekly reboots, my specific configuration does. \nMy Configuration: \nI have mid-2014 MacBook Pro 11,3 (2.8 GHz Intel i7-4980HQ & 1TB SSD w/ 4-lane PCIe link, formatted with APFS).  During this entire time (since Jan. 2018) I've been running a clean install* of High Sierra with only the following non-Apple programs installed:  MS Office, Mathematica, Logitech Gaming Mouse, Keyboard Maestro, Carbon Copy Cloner, Canon Printer, TomTom HOME, MacTeX (suite for using LaTeX), Firefox, Opera, Kindle, Copy Less, Size Up, Decelerator, TestGen, Turbo Tax, Flux, Launch Bar, and EtreCheck.  [*I.e., I wiped the drive, installed High Sierra, and then installed the above programs.]  \nFurther, prior to this (in Nov 2017), I brought the computer to Apple for warranty repair to address the thermal throttling and other issues.  They found the thermal paste was indeed worn out, and replaced the entire motherboard, along with the battery (it was swollen), case, and trackpad. I've not experience thermal throttling since then. \nMy Mac spends most of its time at home, connected to a Logitech K811 keyboard and G502 mouse, and a Dell P2715Q 27\" 4K monitor.\n\nA: Documentation on this does not exist. \nHaving worked as a Certified Apple Engineer (CAE) I can tell you that something has most definitely been lost in translation (for want of a better word) from the original source (i.e. the engineering team) to the AppleCare adviser to you. \nWhile it is arguable (opinions vary greatly) that regularly rebooting a computer (i.e. any computer) is beneficial, there is certainly no kernel expiry going on.  And, as others have already stated, rebooting a Mac is only required for a limited number of updates/upgrades (e.g. firmware updates, OS level updates, hardware upgrades, etc).\nI regularly have various Macs (including MBPs) running 24/7 for weeks/months at a time without any issues. So, being told that you don't reboot your computer often enough, which is necessary because the kernel expires, is nothing more than a figment of someone's imagination. Imagine if all those Macs being used as servers needed a weekly reboot - Apple would be the laughing stock of the IT industry!\nMy recommendation would be to research (and maybe post a separate question about) the issues you're having with Safari's CPU usage. \n\nA: As others have said, this doesn't sound at all like a reasonable response from Apple, and likely something is lost in translation. That said, monthly (or nearly so) kernel panics is definitely something \"out of the ordinary\". The fact that this has persisted across 3 different machines indicates either you have the worst luck with buying flaky hardware, or something common has been transferred from machine to machine.\nI'm assuming you haven't been transplanting RAM chips or HDDs from laptop to laptop, so that leaves either software or some external device. If every new computer you've used TimeMachine or Apple's built in transfer software to migrate your environment, it's possible that some software issue is being propagated each time you upgrade machines. Unfortunately, the only \"quick\" way to validate this is to boot from a clean installation and use that until you're confident the problem no longer persists. If you have an external drive you can use, this is a possibility for you, but otherwise, you would need to back everything up and completely reinstall without restoring the backup, which may be more effort than you want to take. It's possible it's hidden in user preferences in which case creating a new user account and using that might help, but in my experience it's about 50/50 whether it's a user level issue or a system level issue.\nAssuming you don't want to go through those steps, I would try to determine what each kernel panic has in common. If they all seem to happen and coincide with your safari issues, then that narrows it down to a likely issue in safari. You can either try using a different browser for a few months and see if the issue disappears, or try eliminating any plugins/third party addons that you have installed in safari. If the issue persists, runaway CPU usage strikes me as runaway process likely due to some software bug interacting with some ad or other tracking/javascript that is on the sites you're using. Once you've eliminated all of the various plugins as the cause of the issue, you could try installing an ad blocking plugin, preferably one that can block javascript too and crank its restrictiveness to max. This may make some of your browsing less enjoyable (and may even break some sites you use) but these sorts of plugins also allow you to turn off the blocking on a site by site basis, so over time you can relax the restrictions until you find the site that's causing the issues. From there you will have a better starting position for determining exactly what's giving you trouble.\nIf the kernel panics occur even outside of safari usage, you may be looking at your safari problems being caused by whatever is causing the kernel panics, in which case you want to tackle that before you try to figure out safari.\nExternal devices can also cause kernel panics if they're not behaving correctly. So if you use an external HDD or something else commonly plugged into your USB or other expansion ports, try seeing if not using that device clears things up. Even something like a USB thumb drive can cause issues. It's not a common thing, but then again, neither is monthly kernel panics. Alternatively, if you always use the same port for the device, you could try a different port to see if it's an internal hardware issue, but this is less likely given that the problem has persisted across multiple machines.\n\nA: I'm not sure who you talked to at Apple, but Macs, like all Unix-based devices, do not require routine reboots, except for certain updates.\nAs for the kernel, it is the heart of the operating system. There can be only one™. It should have nothing to do with your problem here. If Safari has runaway CPU usage, I'd try deleting its caches first. While in Safari, click on the Safari menu, select Preferences, select the Privacy tab, select \"Manage Website Data...\", then finally select \"Remove All\". Note that you'll have to log in again to some websites, but you won't lose anything crucial.\n", "Q: Edit default Finder MenuBar shortcut I use a custom keyboard and unfortunately, the command: < ctrl+cmd+n > in the Finder to create new folder with selection doesn't work for an obscur reason, so I would like to change it to another command, but the problem is that I cannot enter the exact name in the application keyboard shortcut because the name of the action varies (is dynamic) in function of the number of elements that are selected or because it will say : new folder with \"filename\". \nI tried to add a custom one saying: new folder with selection (2 elements).

(Shown below)\n\nCan anyone please point out where I am going wrong? \n\nA: displayDialog returns an object, not a string. When printing an object as a string, it is shown as [object Object]. The object returned from displayDialog is as follows:\n{\"buttonReturned\":\"Continue\", \"textReturned\":\"your text here\"}\n\nTherefore, you need to use the textReturned property of the object. You seemed to attempt this when you accessed the text property of Origin, but since the property is called ‘textReturned’, this didn't work either. For each of the variables where you are printing it in a string, replace\n\n+ '     From \\t\\t\\t\\t- ' + Origin.text +'\\n'\n+ '     To \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t- ' + Destination + '\\n'\n\n\nwith\n+ '     From \\t\\t\\t\\t- ' + Origin.textReturned +'\\n'\n+ '     To \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t- ' + Destination.textReturned + '\\n'\n\nIn the future when attempting to debug something like this, create a minimal, complete and verifiable example. In this case, just use one displayDialog and observe the value of the variable.

The repairs would be made by removing the corrosion with an ultrasonic cleaner. See a shop like: http://mendonipadrehab.com/price-list for details.\nThe videos explain how the device is taken apart, cleaned / and repaired with spare parts enough to get the data back. They literally will recreate enough of the system to power up and transfer data. \nIt is very possible, but not certain, that you won't get a phone that works long term, but it’s like someone on life support in an emergency room - life can be supported with the right tools in situations for limited time frames.\nIf you don’t want to pay - you could invest money in tools, high grade rubbing alcohol, and a toothbrush to clean the corrosion off yourself. Alternatively, select a less skilled shop - but the chances of success for water damage are far less the longer the time between the water and the repair.\n\nA: You need to use an ultrasonic cleaner\nwhich would be at a repair shop as @bmike♦ answered.\nHe also said    \n\nIf you don’t want to pay - you could invest money in parts or a less\n  skilled shop - but the chances of success for water damage are far\n  less the longer between the water and the repair.\n\nThat is absolutely true.

I routinely need to run large programs for testing purposes on a Mac. And they have a lot of sudo commands. Most of the commands have to do with FTP and string manipulations in plists. \nI know it's silly but do commands run with sudo permission require more RAM? I'm talking around 5-6 GB RAM utilisation which never goes down even after the program has run its course. Currently, the only solution is to reboot the PC.\n\nA: Theoretically yes, there could be memory leaks etc in the application which only trigger when the application runs with administrative or root privileges. In practice the chance for this is probably rather small, and I would look for issues elsewhere first. \n", "Q: How to type in the redundant symbols in Simplified Chinese keyboard layout on MacBook? I consider buying a new MacBook, but just found that the Simplified Chinese keyboard layout option has been added to the new model.\nHowever, as far as the picture goes, it seems there is no difference between the Simplified Chinese and US English with regards to the basic functionality. The picture below is from Apple Store China:\n\nThe only difference is some redundant symbols on backtick, number 4, 6, and two braces, and comma and period (and caps lock is another key but I understand that it is for switching languages easily).\nHowever, I don't understand how you can type in these symbols. How can you type in these characters?\n\nA: The two sets of symbols are supposed to reflect how the keyboard behaves differently when the input source is set to Simplified Chinese Pinyin and when it is switched back to US via Caps Lock.\nEven without the new keyboard, Pinyin input should work that way in Sierra, where the [ ] keys, for example, now produce 【 】.\nThe new keyboard is also available in the US online store.\n", "Q: Install deleted Keynote app in MAC I uninstalled Keynote app from Applications, since I am unable to update it because of the error\n\nI empty trash and try to reinstall it again.

What does this dialog have to do with enabling some set of applications, and what am I apparently enabling these applications to do?\nWhat distinguishes the two options, the set of 'Recommended' applications as opposed to 'All'?\n\nA: With \"Recommended Applications\", you can only select applications which have declared to be able to open that type of file.\nWith \"All Applications\", you can select any application, e.g. open an image in TextEdit (which then will show a lot of strange characters) or a video file in the built-in Chess app (no idea what will happen).

See Apple's current instructions here, but they may change over time and so shouldn't be included in an answer.\nIf the link no longer works, search for \"icloud app-specific password\".  \nYou will need to set up two-step (not two-factor, which your iMac doesn't support) authentication on your iCloud account. \n", "Q: How to go to the position of spotlight's result?

Firstly, kernel_task sometimes takes over extreme amounts of CPU and the whole computer starts acting slow even when I'm not using it for any heavy tasks.\nNote that this is a 15\" MBPro 2015, all specs maxed out.\nFans are also often at full speed for seemingly no reason (just browsing the net) but that has been going on forever since I bought it, and I heard that is relatively normal for those MBPros.\nBut last night the weirdest thing happened. I closed the lid and went to sleep. Several hours later in the morning, I was awoken to my MacBook fans going on at 100%.\nI got up to check it out and the bottom plate was pretty hot and fans still going at 100%. I opened the lid and I couldn't get it to turn on. The screen would not show anything no matter how long I waited and how many keys I pressed. \nI ended up force shutting it down (holding down the power button).\nAny idea what could be causing this? Is there any way I can try to figure out the problem, or is taking it to Apple for repair the only option?\n\nA: The first thing I'd do is a NVRAM and SMC reset (in that order). Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nReset the NVRAM on your MBP as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your MBP reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your MBP reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\nThere's a couple of ways you can reset the SMC on your MBP, however I prefer the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your computer to determine if the issues still persist. \nIf you're still having problems, the it's time to test your hardware with Apple Diagnostics.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n\nA: It happened to me, it’s just a final step of the update install completion process.\n", "Q: I am unable to write my signature using the trackpad in Preview.app I click on the signature button in the Preview.app toolbar:\n\nThe following box pops up:\n\nI click on the Click Here To Begin button.

While that was active and accepting input, I then clicked \"Click here to begin\", and to my surprise it registered my trackpad signature.\nSince I couldn't press a key to end the drawing (since the text box was still active and typing my keypresses), I canceled, exited textbox entry, and tried to register a signature again.

While trying to delete a few messages, I accidentally deleted all messages from a contact on my iPhone, but they're all still there on my iPad. For some reason, iCloud backup doesn't include the messages. Can I restore the deleted messages on the iPhone using my iPad? And how do I include messages in iCloud backup for the future?\n\nA: The only way to get your messages back on your iPhone is to restore your iPhone from a backup that predates when you deleted the messages.\nRight now there is no option to include messages in iCloud backups. Starting with iOS 11, however, there will be. In iOS 11 beta 1, there's an option in Settings to enable full chat archive synchronization in iCloud. \n", "Q: How to remove a user from staff group in macOS? How on earth do I remove one of my local user accounts from the default \"staff\" group in macOS? I've tried many of the obscure commands in the command-line to no avail, i.e dscl, dseditgroup.\nThis is what I tried:\n$ dsmemberutil checkmembership -U someuser -G staff\nuser is a member of the group\n\nTried removing:\n$ sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d someuser -t user staff\n\nChecking membership:\n$ dsmemberutil checkmembership -U someuser -G staff\nuser is a member of the group\n\nHow come?\nI want to remove a particular local account from the staff group so that it doesn't have access to the contents of home directories of other local accounts, amongst other things.\nAny commands and/or GUIs that you can recommend for this?\n\nA: I was also having trouble with this, all the other resources/answers I had found didn't work for me. I finally figured it out (have only tested on my machine on Catalina). This is kind of a kitchen sink approach so some of these steps might be unnecessary, but this is what I did and it worked. I'm not an apple engineer so YMMV and do at your own risk.\nSay we want to remove staff group for a user with the name \"someuser\"\n\n*\n\n*Setup a shell script like this: https://superuser.com/a/395738 (see also notes at end of this answer) it'll make debugging easier. Assuming you've saved it in a file members.sh with executable permission, You can double check that it is working by doing:\n\n./members.sh  staff\n\nand seeing if someuser appears in the list.\n\n\n*From the system preferences UI create a new group, you can do this by under \"Users & Groups\" hitting the plus sign and selecting group in the drop-down box. It doesn't matter what you call it, we'll say \"new_group\"\n\n\n*Select that group in the UI and check the box next to \"someuser\"\n\n\n*Right click on \"new_group\" from the UI and select advanced options, copy the Group ID # (not UUID), it should be a regular number. Say the number is 1234.\n\n\n*Now we are going to change someusers's primary group to new_group instead of staff (see also: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/81553/409162). Do the following:\nsudo dscl . -create /Users/someuser PrimaryGroupID 1234\n\n(where 1234 is the number you copied in step 4)\n\n\n*Right click on someuser from the UI, select \"Advanced Options\" and in the \"Group\" textbox, change \"staff\" to \"new_group\". If you close and re-open this \"Advanced Options\" window it should stay set to new_group.\n\n\n*Finally remove the user from staff. Run the following (note: I got this from the \"EXAMPLES\" section of man dseditgroup you may want to double check there to confirm)\nsudo dseditgroup -o edit -u someuser -p -d someuser -t user staff\n\nYou may have to enter your password because it is a sudo command, but when it says \"Please enter user password\" this refers to someusers's password.\n\n\n*Run ./members.sh staff to check that someuser was successfully removed. If someuser is still in the list:\n\n*\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n*Re-run the command in step #7\n\n*Check again\n\n\n\nI've tried this a couple times, sometimes restarting was necessary, other times it wasn't.

I am working on a Unity game, and I cannot afford to buy both an iPhone 7, and my main phone that I am upgrading to (Galaxy S8), nor can I afford to buy a Mac right now. Would developing on a Virtual Machine running on a Windows Laptop, along with using an iPhone 5C to test and debug on be a good idea? I have heard some problems with developing with the 5C due to the 32 bit processor, but I do not know if that would also apply to games.\n\nA: \"Virtual Machine running on a Windows Laptop\"\nGood luck with that one. There is basically no 3D acceleration in any VM for Windows running macOS currently available. Linux is able to achieve this in some cases (KVM + spare macOS-supported PCIe GPU), but it has its own set of different limitations that may break the deal for you. And it's also banned by macOS's EULA.\n\"along with using an iPhone 5C to test and debug\"\niOS 11 will make the 5C obsolete, as well as any and all 32-bit apps, so you won't be able to do much with a 5C. (Unless you're developing for less than 3 months ;) )\n\"I do not know if that would also apply to games.\"\nIt would, and even more so. There are many technical limitations with 32-bit apps that 64-bit OSes do not have, notably the restriction to no more than 4GB of RAM. It is relatively safe to assume that Apple ended 32-bit app support because the iPad Pros push right into that 4GB limit, and there can only be more and more RAM installed into iOS devices.\nWhat would I do?\nIf you're going solo, make your current laptop a Hackintosh (it breaks the EULA but it's your best option for now) and run all your apps in the Simulator or on friends' devices. I say this for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't make enough money to buy a Mac (~$1000+), you likely aren't a very big company and Apple will never bother to sue you.\n\n*If you are a big enough company that Apple notices that you are using a Hackintosh, you probably have enough money for a few Macs by now, so you can buy one.\n\n\nBetter yet, go develop for a company that has money for you. Then you can earn money to buy your own devices for your own projects and future jobs. Besides, you can probably ask for company funding for a Mac (probably a MacBook Pro 13 Fn, but it's better than nothing) straight-away.\n", "Q: How can I (reliably) delete only future events in Calendar? In Apple's Calendar app, it is not always possible to delete future events as a group.  It seems to consistently be possible when I create a repeating event on my own calendar, but apparently not possible when I have accepted a meeting invitation.\nHere's the response when I try to delete an event I created:\n\nBut here's a failure on Apple's part to give me that ability:\n\nBoth give me the option to only delete the individual event, but only one gives me the option to delete future (and not past) events.\nIs there any way around this?  Is there anyway I can delete only future meetings, without spending hours and hours doing them individually?\n\nA: There is the \"end repeat\" field where you can specify when/if you want the recurring event to stop.\nTo find it, double-click on the event, click into the section that has the date/time/repeat days/alerts/etc., and click the drop-down menu next to end repeat. If you create the recurring event without an end date it will be set to \"Never,\" but you can change it to \"After\" to make the particular instance you opened the last occurrence.\n\nI will also say that it does appear the \"Delete all future events\" option is unavailable when there are other people invited to the event. Like you said, you were invited to the event, so there was at least you and the person who created the event included, and so the future events delete option did not appear.\n", "Q: Access iCloud shared photo stream files on filesystem I use iCloud's shared photo albums from my iPhone and look at the files from my OSX Photos app on my mac laptop.

However, I can't see these files anywhere on my filesystem if I don't \"import\" them.\nUltimately, I'm trying to use the shared album functionality to create a stream, but cross-post the album on another source (probably Google Photos) automatically for family members who are not on OSX.

Or is Siri only able to interact with Apple's native Reminders app?\n\n\nA: For now this feature is only available for Reminders.\nIn iOS 11 it's possible for todo list apps to use Siri.

They were able to take the phone to an Apple store and was able to fix the issue without wiping the phone, saving all data on it. Apple then performed a diagnostic to ensure the hardware was working correctly because it was still under warranty. \nIf you cannot go to an Apple store, an iTunes recovery with your computer is necessary. Good thing you said you can put it in recovery mode because that's what you'll need to do, then use a computer to recover it. \nThis is the only option you have without going to apple support. If Apple cannot manage to fix the issue with the method they used for the individual I know, they will end up doing a wipe and reinstall first to ensure this isn't hardware at fault, then proceed with a hardware diagnostic to confirm that. \nKeeping a devices memory so full that it cannot update is risky. Try not to do that if you can. Use iCloud storage or other services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, One drive, or MEGA to hold/backup your files. \nI highly also recommend always keeping your phone/computer updated at all costs. Security issues are happening all the time now. \n", "Q: Does using a standing desk \"count\" when using the Apple Watch to close rings? A colleague asked me how sensitive the Apple Watch was, and if it supported standing desks. (those hours should count right?) \n\nA: Since WATCH is worn on the wrist, if your wrist rests the same way while you’re standing as it does while you’re sitting, then that time is not going to count as “standing.”\nNormally it is best to walk around with your arms swinging freely for WATCH to detect that you stood. That is why the Stand reminder tells you to move around. The current research also suggests that you need to move around to counteract the negative effects of sitting for too long.\nMy experience has been that at a minimum, you need to hold your arms down your sides for WATCH to detect that you are standing. That is not 100% reliable however, and it is best to take a quick walk (especially since you can no longer use your hand to type anyway).\nEither way, if you keep your hands on your keyboard the entire time at your standing desk, WATCH will not detect that. Another good example is cooking/doing the dishes. You will get Stand reminders while performing those activities, which typically require standing.\n\nA: The activity rings have evolved with each watchOS release. The key is “stand and move” or “roll”. The accelerometers and pulse measurements in the hardware are extremely precise and I find accurate as well.  Apple documents the “stand” ring here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204517\n\nStand\nThe Stand ring shows hours in which you've stood and moved for at least a minute. Complete your daily Stand goal by standing up and moving around for at least 1 minute during 12 different hours in the day. Even if you stand all day, you still need to move around. If you've specified that you use a wheelchair, the Stand ring switches to the Roll ring. Roll shows hours in which you’ve pushed around for at least 1 minute.\n\n", "Q: Inheriting Duplicate Time Machine Backup Sparsebundle on macOS Server Time Machine Server I am running macOS Server and using the Time Machine service. I have a Drobo attached via Firewire 800. I've been backing up my workstations and laptops to it for about 2 years and have built-up backups history.\nI would like to add a second Drobo to the backup server to use as an additional backup destination and configure the clients to alternate backups to the two Time Machine Drobos (TM1, and TM2). However, I'd like the second backup to include the backup history form the existing Sparesebundles.\nCan I simply setup the new backup destination (TM2) and copy the sparsebundles from the original backup destination (TM1) and inherit those backups? That way, if one of the Drobos dies, or one of the backups get corrupt, I will have a the backup history from my other TM storage device.\n\nA: Yes, that it possible. I did this two or three times. \nYou will have to switch off the Time Machine service, then copy the backup just as if you were moving it to a new drive. The same applies to sparsebundles. Note that the copied sparsebundle will have the same maximum size as the old one, but Time Machine will increase it automatically to the size of the volume during the next backup. Finally, switch Time Machine back on, and select the new location as a backup volume. \nTime Machine will check the backup thoroughly (which will take quite a long time), then accept it as base and attach further backups to it. \n", "Q: Can FileVault protected data be accessed if the hard drive has been NON securely wiped? I had my hard drive protected by FileVault before I started having major software issues.  I have plenty of Time Machine backups so I wiped the hard drive using the disk utility in recovery mode.  However, I never overwrote the whole hard drive or used any kind of \"secure\" wipe program.  When I set up my new accounts over the wiped drive, I did not use FileVault either.  I gave Apple the password to my new account which barely had any new data on it (and changed my password to \"hello\" before doing so).  I'm just wondering if the information that is technically still \"there\" when the drive was wiped insecurely can be accessed despite having been protected with FileVault prior to being wiped?\n\nA: The information is there in a cryptographically erased format until you over write the data with a new file or re-encrypt the space with a new key. In some narrow way, the data is there, but no one can reconstitute it. \nSpecifically, each individual block on the storage was uniquely encrypted so you would need mathematically impossible amounts of processing to crack each block and then start the normal data recovery process.\nThe moment the large cryptographic key that was derived from your pass phrase was erased, you lost all practical and most impractical methods to recover any data from the still encrypted storage. \n", "Q: How do I use Lightning EarPods with MacBook Pro 2015?

The monitor didn't display a \"No Signal\" error, but it didn't display anything, either.\nI connected the display to my Windows laptop using its ThunderBolt port and the full native resolution worked fine.\nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both a mini-DP to DP (included with the display) and a mini-DP to mini-DP cable (purchased new)\n\n*Reseting NVRAM\n\n*Reseting the SMC\n\n*Both Thunderbolt ports\n\n*Experimenting with various resolutions using SwitchResX\n\n*Disabling Automatic Graphics Switching\n\n\nI haven't tried using an HDMI cable because I can't seem to find one lying around, and many of the solutions I've found to similar problems involve using a DisplayPort cable instead of an HDMI or DVI cable.\n\nA: I solved this problem by using an HDMI cable.  Full resolution works fine.  I still don't know why DisplayPort doesn't work at full resolution.\n", "Q: Photos smart album for photos with no people at all The macOS Photos app allows searching for photos that contain specific people. But how can one create a smart album that only contains photos that do not contain any people at all?\nIt is possible to create a filter that excludes a specific person.  That filter might be a solution if there only was a way to exclude all persons using a wildcard or similar.\n\nA: \nUpdate: This no longer works and I no longer have a Mac to test\n\nThe smart albums use SQL at the core so you may use % as a wildcard.\nPerson is not %\n\nIf you create a smart album with the above, it will populate full of photos where the facial recognition did not match a photo.

Edit the name there. \nSpecifically it is there so that you can share files with Windows-based PCs via SMB. You can turn that option off under the Sharing Preference pane, then click on File Sharing and the Options button and uncheck \"Share files and folders via SMB.\"\nI have the same OS and see no \"Network Neighborhood.\" That is Windows Nomenclature and might be that you are seeing a Windows PC or PCs on your local network. Some people have file sharing turned on and don't realize it.\nRemote disc is a way of sharing an optical drive from a Mac that has one to a Mac that doesn't. You can choose what you seen the Finder sidebar by going to the Finder (I just usually open a new Finder window) and tap COMMAND , (or go the the Finder menu and select preferences). Then click on the sidebar tab and check or un-check the items you do or do not want to see.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make paste as text only the default action in Office 2016? I hardly ever want to paste with formatting when copying into Word 2016 or Excel 2016 (seriously, who wants fonts when copying into a spreadsheet?).  Is there a way to set the default paste to paste text only when I hit Cmd+V?  \n\nA: In a roundabout fashion yes, mostly...\nIn MS Office their version of \"Paste as plain text\" is called \"Paste and Match Style and uses the macOS system defaults (OptionCommandShiftV) for paste as plain text for that function.\nNow if you don't want to have to do that four finger salute just to paste (essentially) plain text, you can change the menu shortcuts in any application via the Keyboard Preference pane.\n\n*\n\n*Click on System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n*Click the + button and from the Application menu select (for example) Microsoft Word.\n\n*Enter the menu title that you want to change. noting that the menu that you want to assign or reassign its keyboard shortcut must match exactly what the menu says down to the capitalization.\n\n*Click in the Keyboard Shortcut field and tap the keyboard shortcut you want to assign to that menu option, then click Add\n\n*Repeat for any other keyboard shortcuts you want to add/change in any other applications you want to change them for.\n\nIn this example I reassigned \"Paste\" to OptionCommandShift V. And \"Paste and Match Formatting\" to CommandV.\n\nI didn't do this for all applications as I don't want to chance messing up the behavior of other applications that you can copy/paste with.\nNOTE that this is not really \"paste plain text\" but will give you at least some of that functionality with very little pain.\nTo really get paste plain text in an MS Office application you would likely need something that could capture a regular paste command and then select the plain text icon from the formatting menu that pops up at the insertion point after you paste. There may be a macro program out there that can do that but I am unaware of any specific ones with that functionality.\n\nA: For some versions of Word, I have v16.16.7 (whatever edition that is), I was able to use a version of the Tools > Customize Keyboard solution. Once there, select Edit on the left and PasteTextOnly on the right. Then, add whatever keyboard shortcut you want, e.g., command+V. I have not extensively road tested this but it seems to work. No idea if this can be extended elsewhere in Office. \n\nA: Steve Chambers solution works for Word, but not for Excel, because there simply is no \"Paste and Match Formatting\" command in Excel. Only Paste or Paste Special. Thus for Excel, I believe the answer is no, unfortunately. But I'd love to proven otherwise. \n\nA: Here is the definite solution for all versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select a cell and copy it.\n\n*Go to Tools > Macros > record new macro.\n\n*Specify a shortcut, for example option+command+b\n\n*Click enter\n\n*focus on any empty cell and click control+v, then select \"paste and style formatting\" in the options.\n\n*Go to Tools > Macros > Stop Macro.\n\n*Next, download and install BetterTouchTool.\n\n*Go to Preferences > keyboard.\n\n*Add new shortcut. Enter command+v in the shortcut field and enter option+command+b in the triggered shortcut field.\n\n*Done.\n\n\nA: I used the above answer as a reference and added my own solution:  \nMacro1: \nCopy some formatted text.\nLet the document cursor stay somewhere in the document.\nGo to Tools > Macros > record new macro.\nSpecify a shortcut with option+command+shift+b (finish macro creation)\nPress cmd+v\nSelect destination formatting\nGo to Tools > Macros > Stop Macro.  \nMacro2:\nGo to Tools > Macros > record new macro\nSpecify a shortcut with cmd+v (override the normal paste)\nThis time you press option+command+shift+b\nGo to Tools > Macros > Stop Macro\nDone.  \nNow each time you press cmd+v you will call a macro which calls another macro and your text will be formatted correctly. (This is a solution tested in word)\n\nA: Here is a solution that works on Excel for Mac 16.42!\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Tools > Customize Keyboard... menu.\n\n*Under Categories choose Commands not in the Ribbon\n\n*In the Search bar under Commands type \"Match\" and select the command named Match Destination Formatting . (I bet you would have searched for \"Paste\" instead and never found this command!)\n\n*Click in the input box that says Press new keyboard shortcut:\n\n*Type the shortcut you want, in my case that is Command+V and make sure to click Add. Note: that it tells you this command is already assigned to \"Paste\". That's fine, we will overwrite it.\n\n*You should see your keyboard command in the list of Current keys: now.\n\n*Click OK.\n\nNote that the \"Paste Values\" command doesn't work for values copied from outside of Excel for some reason. But \"Match Destination Formatting\" seems to do what I want.\n\nA: I found that every option on here didn't work for me, but you guys have helped me find a way.\nI am using a Mac Pro with macOS 11.6 and Excel for Mac 16.54 with MS Office 365.\nI managed to get plain text on CmdV in Excel by going to Tools > Customise Keyboard, then in the Categories:, select Commands Not in the Ribbon**. Then in the search box under Commands:, I typed in \"Paste\". I then selected Paste Values and then clicked in the box below \"Press new keyboard shortcut\" and pressed the CmdV keys. Then clicked Add and OK.\nI can now paste just the values.\n\n\nA: On Word for Mac (version 16.55) on Big Sur:\nTools > Customise keyboard > All Commands > PasteTextOnly\nAdd shortcut.

I'm using Siri to set short timers, many times in a row: \"Set timer for 45 seconds.\" This is on an iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 10.3.2 (14F89).\nIt works great, but each time Siri confirms the timer she adds a humorous quip from a short list:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Just remember, a watched iPhone never boils.\"\n\n*\"The suspense is killing me.\"\n\n*\"I see you shiver with antici... pation.\"\n\n*\"Roger that. T-minus 45 seconds.\"\n\n\nI assume these comments are intended to make Siri seem more human but obviously they have the opposite effect, especially as they are repeated ad nauseam. They're annoying and unprofessional.\nI don't want to silence Siri completely; I want verbal confirmation that the timer was set. Ideally \"timer set for 45 seconds\", or even just \"timer set\".\nIs there any way to turn off Siri's funny comments? I want this primarily for the timer, but I'd be fine with turning chatty mode off globally too.\nThings I've tried that don't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing language from English (US) to English (UK, Australia, etc.) Different accent, same jokes.\n\n*Saying \"Cut the jokes\" after a joke. Siri says sorry, but jokes don't stop.\n\n\nA: You can't.\nDue to the design of Siri, you cannot change the way she behaves. This behavior is all run off of apple servers and is the same for every person. \nSiri is able to learn behaviors but that is limited to repeated behaviors like opening an app and the way you speak. \nSo no,  because of the way that Siri was written, you cannot disable her \"jokes\". Sorry about that. \n\nEDIT:\nSource: myself after listening and reading up on Apple's privacy info, and the Internet's many forum posts complaining about this topic.\nAlso, from more reading, I found out that people have varying amounts of times that this happens to them. Generally, people who don't mind it (like me) don't really notice it.

I seriously don't recommend doing that, but it's doable if you want to spend the time coding it.\nThat said, why not just use a method that doesn't require using killall Dock and immediately changes the wallpaper?\nHere are two examples using AppleScript:\ntell application \"Finder\" to set desktop picture to POSIX file \"/Library/Desktop Pictures/Milky Way.jpg\"\n\nOr:\ntell application \"Finder\" to set desktop picture to alias \"Macintosh HD:Library:Desktop Pictures:Sierra.jpg\"\n\nFrom the command line, e.g. in Terminal or shell based script:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to set desktop picture to POSIX file \"/Library/Desktop Pictures/Milky Way.jpg\"'\n\nAny of these immediately changes the wallpaper without further need to do anything.\n", "Q: How can users identify which of their iPhone/iPad apps are still only 32-bit (and therefore won't work in future)? Many iPhone/iPad users still use apps on their devices which are only 32-bit. These apps will not work in future if users upgrade to iOS 11, unless of course the apps themselves are updated to run natively in 64-bit.\nThis being the case, users may want to identify any important apps they have installed that will become useless if they upgrade to iOS 11 in a few months. By doing this users can prepare for the upgrade by:\n\n\n*\n\n*contacting the developer to confirm their future development plans, and\n\n*finding alternative apps that will meet their needs\n\n\nHow can users identify which of their currently installed apps are still only 32-bit?\n\nA: In iOS 10.3 and above, users can: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Swipe up and tap on General\n\n*Tap on About\n\n*Tap on Applications\nA list will appear showing all of the apps you have installed that \nwon’t run in 64-bit mode. Now you can tap on any of your important apps \nto determine if it is still available on the App Store.

Other graph types use category-value, shown at the top of your screenshot. To replace your graph with a scatter graph, choose Chart → Chart Type and select 2D Scatter. Now, under Axis the tabs will show ‘Value (Y)’ and ‘Value (X)’ instead of ‘Category (X)’, such that Logarithmic is available for both.\n", "Q: How to use multiple audio outputs (of a mac) simultaneously? I have en external USB-audio device, which is great (Steinberg/Yamaha).\nAnd a bluetooth speaker and an Apple TV.\nIs it possible to stream audio to ALL this devices simultaneously and synchronously ?\n\nA: For this you can use the App \"Audio MIDI Setup\" in /Applications/Utilities.\nWhen you open the app, you will see a list of all audio devices in the list to the left. With the \"+\" button at the bottom you can create a new Aggregate Device or a Multi-Output Device.\nThe devices created there will show up as normal audio devices in the system preferences' \"Sound\" settings.\nThe Multi-Output Device seems to be what you are looking for. It will output the audio to all devices enabled in the right part of the window.\nThe Aggregate Device allows you to join multiple sound cards to simulate one audio device with more output channels (e.g. instead of four separate stereo outputs you would see a single 8 channel output).\n", "Q: Is there a way to go back a few seconds in a movie on iTunes on a Mac?

The people who I purchased it from were unable to perform the factory reset. They tried for over an hour. So I have this really nice MBP that still has all of their information. I have all their log in information, so that we can reset it ourselves. They purchased it as a reconditioned unit 2 years ago they haven't really used it and have never made any updates.  It came with the box and all the installation disks. The disk is Snow Leopard. \nFirst and foremost what's the best way to process the reset?\nWill I have to install Snow Leopard?\nIf so how do I install El Capitan​?\nIs there a way to upgrade to Sierra? It's a mid 2009.\n\nA: The best way to do a factory reset of a Mac is basically to wipe the hard drive and reinstall from scratch. You can boot off the installation DVD (insert the DVD, reboot and hold down the ALT key to get the boot selection menu), then once you see the first page of the install wizard choose Disk Utility from the menubar to wipe the drive. Then you can continue the install to get a fresh copy of Snow Leopard. Once that is complete you'll be able to freely update to El Capitan from the Mac App Store.\nUnfortunately it looks like you won't be able to upgrade to Sierra. The earliest MacBook Pro supported by Sierra is the Mid 2010 model. https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/#hardware-requirements\nHowever if this MacBook hasn't been used since reconditioning, then perhaps just creating a new account for yourself and deleting their account would be enough. Just select System Preferences from the Apple menu, and click on \"Accounts\".

I've tried upgrading the OS X to Sierra (previously I'm still in Yosemite) but it didn't solve the problem at all. I can't access /var/root/Library/alumni either.\n\nA: I would start by checking the folders /Library/LaunchAgents and /Library/LaunchDaemons. In these folders you will find a bunch of \"plist\" scripts that tell the system how and when to launch certain pieces of software.\nI think you'll find one there that tells the system to launch this \"alumni\" software.

I had been seeing it page to the beginning/end since the particular rows had few entries.\nHold on ..  So the behavior is that the `Command-Left|Right Arrow will move to the next non-empty cell if there were other intervening empty cells.  So in the case of a row with all entries filled - e.g. the Header Row - a single invocation puts you at beginning/end of the entire row: so in that case it behaves like Row Home/Row End.  \nThis is not acceptable behavior: is there any workaround?\n\n\nA: Although it seems counter intuitive not to use the left/right arrows, (that is a subject for giving Microsoft some feedback) using the following key combinations work for Excel 15.xx for Mac:\n\nUsing Built-in MacBook Keyboard:\nPage Right: fn+⌥ option+↓ down arrow\nPage Left: fn+⌥ option+↑ up arrow\nUsing External Apple Wired Keyboard:\nPage Right: ⌥ option+page down\nPage Left: ⌥ option+page up\n\nAs noted in the OP's screenshot.\n", "Q: How can I change a URL that an application pings I'm trying to resurrect an old mac application.\nCurrently it is trying to scrape data from deadurl.com/?12345\nAlthough that url is dead so it's not working.

Occasionally - even with abundant care - my 16GB MBPro runs out of application memory and the dreaded \"No more application memory available\" dialog appears.\nFortunately we are still able to access Activity Monitor:  and the first thing I do is kill the web browsers that tend to accumulate large amounts of memory over time.\nLess fortunate is that - even after verifying that the Memory Used + Swap Memory are less than 10GB combined, it is still not possible to resurrect the Paused applications.  \n\nIf it were not possible to resuscitate the paused apps - then what good is this notification?  Are we compelled to simply kill the apps ourselves?  Given there is now sufficient memory for any of the remaining open apps to continue then why are they still unable to do so?\n\nA: Not in front of my mac right now, but basic steps would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal application: just type Terminal into Spotlight\n\n*List the running processes : ps -ax\n\n*Find the process you want to unpause. You need its PID *Process Id\n\n*To unpause, strangely enough you use the \"Kill\" command on the process with the CONT flag: kill -CONT [app_pid] dont forget the -CONT as otherwise you will kill it instead of unpausing. In your example that'd bekill -Cont 69971\nYou can get the pid from the Activity Monitor if you have that column showing\n", "Q: Console on 10.2.5 not showing history before Console.app started I know that I used to be able to start up Console to see things like what happened due to a system error: you could just fire it up and search for the most recent \"boot\" and look at the events before that to see what had happened.\nNow, however, it seems that my scrollback in Console.app is limited to the moment I started it. That is, I would have to have it running all the time in order to see what's going on on the system, and what I described above (i.e., seeing what's going on around a boot/reboot) is impossible.\nIs this now the new behaviour? I admit I hadn't looked at it for a while (probably an OS version or two).\nI should mention that I had to restore my machine recently from a Time Machine backup. That's the only notable variable I can think of.\n\nA: Ah, as Phong notes, this is a duplicate of Sierra Console.app show earlier data.\nThe short version is that the Sierra Console.app behaves this way currently by design (although there are a couple of workarounds noted in the other answer, depending on what you want).\n", "Q: Can I pair 2 Bluetooth headsets to my iPad simultaneously? We watch tv on it when traveling We own 2 pairs of the same headsets and wish to pair them simultaneously to watch tv on the iPad.  Only one at a time seems to work.  They have the same name which may be the issue, but I can't find an answer online.\nIs it possible to send audio to two Bluetooth headsets simultaneously? If so, how?\n\nA: iOS will only output sound to one device at a time, and that includes the internal speakers. So no, you can't pair multiple Bluetooth headsets and listen through both simultaneously.\nYour only options would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Each use a single earpiece from the same headset.\n\n*Purchase a Bluetooth splitter.\n\n", "Q: My phone won't give me Storage no matter what I do So I try to download an app but a thing pops up saying I can't because I don't have enough storage on my phone so I go to my settings and I delete some apps and some pictures on my phone but it didn't do anything it still said I have 0 storage! So I get a flash drive and download all my photos on to it and then go back on my phone and delete them all ( well all most all of them I had 1300 photos  and I deleted like 700 photos)and I go back and there was no change my pictures was still using the same amount of storage and it still said I have 0 space left! It's making me mad! Please help! ( do I need a new phone??)\nPs.i also deleted a bunch of old text messages and group chats but that didn't do anything either!\n\nA: In terms of the 700 photos you've deleted, have you also deleted them from the Recently Deleted album? \nWhen you delete a photo/video in the iOS Photos app, it does not actually delete that photo immediately. Instead, deleted photos are placed into the Recently Deleted album. These photos will remain there for 30 days at which point they will be deleted by the system. This overall process is designed to give users the chance to recover their photos/videos in the event they change their mind, etc.\nIf you need to free up space immediately, you can manually go into the Recently Deleted album and select any/all items and delete them from there. This removes them from that point rather than waiting for 30 days to pass. Of course, doing this means that recovering them is almost impossible - so make sure you have a working backup of your photos/videos!\n", "Q: Can't get my USB-C to Display Port Adapter to work on new iMac; works on MacBook Pro I bought a new 2017 iMac 27\", but I still want to use my 4K monitor. I was using the monitor with my 2012 MacBook Pro just plugging in the mini-DP cable into a Thunderbolt 2 port. \nI tried the \"All Smart Life\" USB Type C to Mini DP adaptor, which advertised that it worked on the new MacBook Pro, but it didn't work on my iMac.  \nDoes anyone know what adapter I can use to connect my new iMac to my 4K monitor?\n\nA: Thunderbolt is a \"multiplexing\" of several signals including DisplayPort so the signal already exists there.  You just need a Thunderbolt to DisplayPort cable that goes from USB-C to DisplayPort (or mini DisplayPort if necessary) and you will be able to connect your 4K monitor.\n", "Q: Mac Mini - New SSD - Randomly restarting I've had my 2011 Mac Mini for a while. About a year ago the internal HDD decided to give up. Oh well.\nI just now finally got around to being able to replace the hard drive. I decided to go with an SSD (a Samsung 850 PRO, got it from Amazon here). Installed OS X 10.10.4 (have an application that is broken on 10.10.5+ unfortunately).\nSo after all of this I've been using it for about a day. Over that day it has seemingly restarted itself several times while it was idle and nobody was looking (meaning the monitor was off and nothing was connected over VNC, but apps, mainly chrome, were running - nothing uncommon and that I haven't used on other Macs with no issues).\nThe only clue I can see (not that I exactly know what I'm looking for) is in Console. I get an error message stating kernel[0]: Previous shutdown cause: -128.\nI did have previous errors with this machine where it would randomly restart every once and a while, where I couldn't figure out a rhyme or reason, but these were way more infrequent and happened no more often or differently than other Macs I have. Certainly not 3 or 4 times in a day.\n\nA: Shutdown cause -128 is \"hardware\" related; most times, I have noticed it's related to memory.\nWhat you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*NVRAM and SMC Reset.  Hold CommandOptionPR for about 20 seconds while turning on from a powered off state.  The boot chime should sound about 3 times; then release and boot normally.  To reset the SMC, shut down, unplug your Mac mini for 30 seconds, then plug back in and restart.\n\n*Reseat the memory modules (you may have inadvertently caused a bad connection when replacing the drive)\n\n*Run Apple Hardware Test (AHT).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.   Make sure you run the extended tests.\n\n\nIf your memory tests come back with errors, remove one module and try again.  Make sure you tests each module individually in each slot individually.  You want to see if the problem (if it exists) stays in the same location (slot is bad) or moves (memory is bad)\n", "Q: Are there any low-level settings in local Directory Service that can increase the blocking time after typing wrong password? I find there's a global policy that can temporarily block/disable a user (only 1 minute) after authenticating with wrong passwords a few times.\nBut what I want to do is to increase that 1 minute to a longer time, or permanently disable that user. Is it possible?\n\nA: Try using pwpolicy\npwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setpolicy \"minutesUntilFailedLoginReset=3\"\n\nThis will set the policy of a failed login for a local account to 3 mins between logins.\npwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setpolicy \"maxFailedLoginAttempts=1\"\n\nThis will set the maximum number of failed login attempts to just 1 (IMO this is way to restrictive to account for innocent typos)\n", "Q: Backup entire mac hard drive to a usb drive and later restore I would like to backup the entire system drive/partition to a USB hard/flash drive.  I have a 128gb usb flash drive and a 2tb usb hard drive.  I am borrowing a friends macbook air for learning swift/ios programming for a few months.  \nI figured that I can back it up and restore it later for minimal inconvenience for him.  I would prefer to not have to log in or install anything on it.  I currently don't have his account password but can get it if needed.\nBTW the mac is el capitan I think.  It is a different looking disk utility than I have seen in some online screenshots elsewhere.  \nWhat I have tried:\nBooting to the recovery mode using command +r.\nThen I erased the usb drive (name 06192017, format osx extended journaled, GUID partition map).\nThen I selected the 06192017 and selected edit>restore.\n\"Restore from:\" I selected \"macintosh HD\" and clicked restore.\nIt takes a little while and then fails.

Same results.\nI am new to mac OSX.  Am I going about this all wrong?  \n\nA: If I'm understanding you correctly you want to backup the MacBook before you use it, then restore it a few months later so that anything you do over the next few months is wiped out and you can return it to your friend in the same condition you received it.\nIf this was me, what I'd do is just create a new dust2098 account for myself in the \"Users & Groups\" panel of System Preferences, and log into that account for the next few months and then before giving the MacBook back, log into your friend's account and delete that new dust2098 account I'd created for myself.\nI'm assuming you are coming from a Windows background. Macs are quite different from Windows and don't accumulate quite as much cruft as they are being used. For example, where application store their settings in the Registry in Windows, they are stored in individual plist files within your own account on a Mac. Also where random applications will regularly try to install or make changes to the c:\\Windows folder (less so in more recent versions of Windows), on a Mac the /System folder and other critical locations are locked down by the System Integrity Protection (SIP) feature.\n", "Q: Where does a copy go on my iPad? On my iPad Air 2 there is a copy choice under the share button. When I use this button, I can't find the copy. It's not in my photos, and if try the paste function nothing is there. Where is the copy?\n\n\nA: On devices like tablets, phones and computers, using the copy function on a piece of data, such as some text or an image, places that data in a temporary location called the clipboard, where it can be retrieved in software programmes by using the paste function. That data will stay in the clipboard until you have overwritten it by copying something else. \nThe clipboard can't be viewed on an iOS device (unless there is an app I don't know about that lets you do so), but whatever you have copied can be pasted into any text entry field that will allow you to - simply tap and hold, on the input area, and choose 'Paste'. Images can also be copied and pasted on iOS, although there are fewer applications for this outside of placing images in e-mails or notes.\nIf you're trying to copy and paste something but nothing is happening, your issue could be that;\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS can't actually copy and paste what you've selected, regardless of whether or not it gave you the option (unlikely)\n\n*iOS can't paste what you have copied into the input location you have selected (most likely)\n\n*iOS has a software issue of some kind, which could be resolved by rebooting the device, or by updating or restoring iOS via iTunes (less likely)\n\n\nBe sure that you're trying to paste into an input field that can accept the data you've copied, or that you did indeed tap 'Copy', before attempting a reboot or anything more severe.\n\nA: It’s in the clipboard, so you can paste it using the normal paste action in any app.\n\nA: If you use that copy option in Safari, all you are copying is the address of the website.\nIf you try pasting in a text message or pasting in an email, you should see the address of the website. If you go into the Photos app, it won't even offer the paste option because there is nothing the Photos app can do with a piece of plain text.\n\nA: There is an app called Klipboard that runs on both macOS and iOS. Whatever you copy will show up in this app. So if you copy on iPad then open Klipboard it will show up.

I tried with an external USB mouse, but no success. However, keys work during the startup when I'm trying PRAM reset. Booted in safe mode but again they froze at login screen. Recovery mode didn't work either. I just can't login into my mac.\nMy machine is MacBookPro 15\" Mid 2009, running macOS Sierra. \nUpdate: Recovery mode doesn't work, it shows nothing, but I booted with Option key to select startup disk and both keyboard and touchpad work while choosing the startup disk. But once I got to the login screen, they both freeze.\nAny hints what might be the problem and what other steps I should take before taking it to the repair shop?\nThank you very much!\n\nA: First off, you are running macOS Sierra on on an unsupported Mac.  Per Apple's official supported hardware list, it supports MacBook Pros from 2010 and newer.\nmacOS Sierra was installed either by:\n\n\n*\n\n*using some sort of \"hack\" to trick the installer into thinking it was supported hardware\n\n*installing it on a different MacBook Pro then moving drive with the new macOs installation into your MacBook Pro.\n\n\nIt's quite conceivable that this installation initially worked, but after an update, things would break because Apple is not anticipating that macOS Sierra is working on unsupported hardware.\nThe fact that it's working in a pre-boot environment, is a good sign that your hardware is good, though it's not conclusive.  What you need to do is to revert back to El Capitan (10.11.x).  \nRun Internet Recovery CommandOptionR instead of booting from the Recovery partition.  This will load the last supported OS.  If your keyboard and trackpad works, then you have your answer.\nWhat you will need to do next is to erase your drive and start with a fresh install of El Capitan.  \n\nA: I have 2 MacBook Pro's 2009.\nMy keyboard and trackpad stopped working on one. Tried usual – resetting Pram and SMC – no result. \nI opened it to find the Trackpad Cable was damaged. I didn't want to start buying pieces for it when I wasn't sure if trackpad cable would have affected the keyboard as well – and online advice said it shouldn't –  so I disconnected it on my other Macbook to find it wouldn't even start with the Trackpad cable disconnected ??\nAnyway, to answer the question, I bought a new trackpad cable Online for €15, fitted it and all(trackpad AND Keyboard) are working again :)\nAll the best!\nSeán\n", "Q: Save web page and associated files separately (Just like on Windows) I am a previous windows user and I try to continue my work on a Mac.\nMy dilemma now is how to simply save a web page as html and all associated files in a separate folder. \nThis was easy in Windows. \nWhen I saved a web page I got the option to Save entire web page.\nIt downloaded an HTML file and created a folder with the same name as the file with added \"-files\".\nAll associated files like images, stylesheet and some javascript were downloaded in that folder.\nI like this way because I have then a total control of the downloaded web page to add a note or elements as I chose to.\nMore plus, if I save multiple web pages from the same web site, all images that are the same (like layout) will only replace the older images (as long as they have the same file name). So the size will not increase as much. The \"-files\" folder will only increase with new article images.\nOn a Mac - Safari only have two options....\nSave source or webarchive.\nWebarchive is not edit-friendly\nAnyone got a tip or suggestion?\n\nA: Try Google Chrome. It does like you suggest when you choose \"Web Page, Complete\" on saving a page. It saves an HTML file and then all the associated in a folder with a similar name.\n", "Q: How do I change the bitrate field of an mp3 file? I have some music files which have somehow the wrong bitrate settings (32 instead of 320). Yes they are really 320bps, the file size and show exactly that. So this means no Apple Music availability. I tried changing the values in the iTunes XML file, but that did nothing, as kind-of expected. Other programs also show the wrong bitrate or none at all. Searching for 32 in a Hex-Editor of that file was useless as well. \n\nA: Sorry but if the file has been encoded at the wrong bitrate, then they'll need to be re-encoded i.e. you'll need to rip them from a CD again. The bitrate refers to the amount of data that is used to store a second of audio. There is no way to increase this, in any meaningful way, once it's been created.\nHowever if the file are encoded with Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding there does seem to be a common problem where the bitrate is misreported. If I'm reading things correctly it's because software like iTunes just looks at the bitrate of the first chunk of the file (which might just be silence or something simply resulting in a low bitrate encoding) and report that as the bitrate even though subsequent chunks might have completely different (higher) rates. There does appear to be a tool to fix this called vbrfix. However there doesn't seem to be an easy to get this tool for Macs.\nIf you are relatively confident with using the Terminal you could try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download http://http.debian.net/debian/pool/main/v/vbrfix/vbrfix_0.24+dfsg.orig.tar.xz\n\n*Decompress the file with something like The Unarchiver (macOS native Årchive Utility won't know what to make of it)\n\n*Open a Terminal window and cd to the path of the unarchived files\n\n*Run ./configure and then make to compile the vbrfixc binary\n\n*Assuming the binary compiles successfully cd into the \"vbrfixc\" folder and you should find the vbrfixc binary.\n\n*Run it with ./vbrfixc -log input.mp3 output.mp3.\n\n\nIf the file is a VBR MP3 file this will attempt to fix it by placing a blank chunk at the beginning of the file with a bitrate that is more representative of the entire file.\n", "Q: Partition problem with APFS containers in macOS High Sierra As always I'm so impatient and migrating with my main devices to the first developer previews the day they are available.\nWhich as always bring me only problems but I just cannot help myself.\nSo this time I wanted to see High Sierra before going all in.

I'd like to use an external USB3 drive for Windows 10, but I don't know how to install it. Booting the Windows installer errors out saying that it can't be installed on an external device.\n\nA: You'll need to install Windows in a virtual machine and then copy the virtual disk to the target disk. The free trial of Parallels Desktop worked for me.\nOnce you get your Windows installed in the virtual machine, go into Parallels' settings and shrink the virtual disk as much as possible (I shrunk mine to 32GB but you could probably go with even less). Once that's done attach a bootable Linux ISO (Ubuntu) or something like CloneZilla to the VM and boot the VM from it that instead of Windows.\nOnce the VM is booted, pass-through your target USB drive to the VM, and then clone the (virtual) Windows disk to the external drive from within the VM. On an Ubuntu 17.04, I used the following terminal commands to do it:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4M\n\n/dev/sda being the virtual Windows disk, /dev/sdb being the target drive attached to the VM.\nOnce that's done you can power down the VM, then reboot your Mac and hold the Option/Alt key while rebooting until you see a boot menu asking which device you want to boot from. Select \"EFI boot\" and Windows should be loading from the target drive.\nOnce you are in Windows it's a good idea to check for updates, check your privacy settings to make sure everything is correct and most of the privacy-invading stuff is disabled, and use Disk Management to enlarge your disk partition to take the entire space of the target drive (a bit by bit copy of the virtual disk means the partition on the target drive is just as small despite the drive being larger).\nFinally you might want to install the Boot Camp drivers to make sure all hardware is recognized by Windows. To do so reboot back in macOS and run the Boot Camp assistant to create a Windows bootable USB from your ISO image. We don't actually care about the Windows part anymore since it's now installed, but the assistant will also put drivers on that USB and this is what we want. Once that's finished reboot back onto your target drive, then insert the Boot Camp USB and you should see a \"Boot Camp\" folder there, with a \"setup.exe\" inside. Run that and you should be good to go.\n", "Q: Which Apple ID is used for Apple Music—iCloud or iTunes?

They are in different countries.\nWhich Apple ID is used if I sign up for Apple Music?\nIs it even possible to be logged in with different iCloud and iTunes IDs and use Apple Music?\n\nA: Your iTunes Apple ID is used. I also use two Apple IDs and the one logged in to iTunes & App Store in Settings is the one which was used.\n", "Q: iCloud won't let me in using a third party app I don't know what I am doing.

It just makes 3 short tones.\nWhere could be a problem?\n\nA: The three short tones with a 5 second interval between sets is indicative of a RAM failure\nFrom Apple's support document:  About Mac startup tones\n\nThree successive tones, then a five-second pause (repeating): RAM\n  doesn't pass a data integrity check.\n\nThe MacBook Air doesn't have any user serviceable memory, so it's a logic board issue.  Since you cannot boot, there's really no other option but to take it in for service.\nIt's likely that Apple will want to replace the logic board for a large sum of money.  I suggest looking at a reputable 3rd party repair shop.  I have used Rossmann Repair Group in the past with great success (not affiliated, just a client)\nHe even has a YouTube video with your exact problem and how he fixes it; it's technical, but full of good info.  Caution:  he's from NYC so his language is typically colorful.\n", "Q: Reduce size of the Xcode application Is there anyway to reduce the disk space used to store the Xcode application? I only downloaded Xcode so that I could compile C and C++, so if possible I would like it to take up much less than the 9.22GB it requires right now. Perhaps there are optional portions I can uninstall?\n\nA: Although it's not directly related to the Xcode app size. There are multiple places where you can delete files to free up some space.\n1. Derived Data\nXcode keeps data about your projects which includes index, build output and logs. Go to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ and delete the folders for projects that you no longer need to keep this data around for.\n2. iOS Device Support\nXcode is storing information about the devices you have used for development. Delete the data no longer needed in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport/.\n3. Archives\nDelete the one’s you don’t need in the Organizer, or go to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/ to delete them in bulk. Be careful not to delete archives for which you still need the dSYM data for debugging.\n4. Simulators\nSimulators are stored under ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices. For each version of iOS you are building for.\n5. Documentation Browse and delete unnecessary data under ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets.\n\nA: Perhaps a more elegant solution would to be use the command line tools instead of Xcode.\nYou could delete Xcode entirely (or skip the install).\nInstead of downloading and installing Xcode - open the command line (terminal app works out of the box) and type gcc.\nThat will pop up a window where you can install the command line tools. Click install, click agree and the C compilers and libraries and debuggers will all download and install.\nOn 10.11 the command line tools take about 200 MB of disk space. The dmg to install the Xcode 9 version beta command line tools is less than that as well, so it’s a pretty slim set of tools if you want to preserve disk space and can use another IDE / editor and don’t need all the features Xcode provides.\n", "Q: Mac Pro trashcan as file server for 60+ users I'm wondering if anyone out there has had any experience using a Mac Pro trashcan as a file server for a medium business.  My concern is that it won't be able to handle the network traffic for 60+ connected users (AFP).  \nThe reason I am not wanting to use a NAS or something like that is that I need to have dropbox on the server syncing the shared volume.  \nDoes anyone have any experience with a scenario like this?  \n\nA: You should reconsider a NAS because using a Mac Pro is complete overkill when a NAS will do exactly what you want including sync to public cloud services like DropBox, OneDrive, Box.net, etc.\nI am a fan of Synology products because whether you are using their entry level single disk NAS devices or their enterprise grade rack mount solutions, the software and features are the same.   Specifically, to your question, it includes Cloud Sync which will sync up with DropBox.\nAlso, consider moving from AFP to SMB.  AFP has been deprecated in Yosemite in favor of SMB2.  AFP is also not compatible with the new APFS.\nHowever, most NAS devices will still provide AFP for backward compatibility.\nFinally, I suggest you utilize their \"NAS calculator\" because sizing a file sharing solution is more than just how many people it needs to serve, but the type of files, how much space, your iops requirement etc.\n", "Q: What are safe or average component temperatures for my MacBook?

All modern computers have thermal limits which will shut down the machine if it becomes too hot.  If this is happening on a regular basis, there is something wrong and it needs to be addressed\nFurther, if you actually smell something burning from your computer this is a physical problem that simply cannot be fixed with an app.  This is like running your car without out oil and then expecting to put some high grade gasoline because it has wear additives that prolong the life of your engine in the hopes that it solves the problem.  \nTo put this another way, you can't \"un-toast\" toast and get bread.\nOnce you smell the telltale scent of burnt electronics, you're past the point of no return - it's time to take it in for service.\n", "Q: Hide Finder From Dock in Sierra I have seen this instruction for hiding the Finder icon from MacOS:\nhttps://github.com/jesscXC/hide-finder-trash-dock-icons\nHowever, it doesn't seem to work on MacOS Sierra because the DockMenus.plist file seems to be locked and cannot be changed.

I have searched long and hard and have found no way to independently adjust the tracking speed of the mouse cursor on a Mac. I'm running 10.11.6 El Capitan on my 2013 15\" Retina MacBook Pro.\nFor whatever reason my mouse moves WAY faster horizontally than vertically. I have without success tried both USB Overdrive as well as Steermouse to see if they have any options that would let me adjust this. I've searched for ways to adjust this via the terminal.\nAt first I thought it was a Logitech mouse issue. I have been using a Razer Orochi mouse with the Razer Synapse software installed it's been working great. I wanted to try out a Logitech M705, and started noticing this issue. I tried installing the Logitech Control Center to see if that would help. No luck. Then I tried an Apple Magic Mouse, and noticed the vertical tracking speed is faster vertically than it is horizontally. Very odd.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: If you use your Razer Orochi along with the Synapse software from Razer, it will give you the option to change the vertical sensitivity.\n\nA: Although I have not found a way to manually adjust the X and Y tracking speed of the mouse, I believe I've solved the issue. \nThe issue appears to have been caused by the Razer Synapse software. After uninstalling it, the tracking speeds are back to normal with non-razer brand mice.\n", "Q: Mac Screenshot Markup/Annotation with Text that Sticks to Arrows I'm looking for a screenshot markup/annotation tool that attaches text to the origin of an arrow.\nScreenshot markup/annotation apps usually allow you to add arrows that point to parts of the shot. They also allow you to add text, commonly to explain the problem. \nCommonly for me I add an arrow that points to an issue then add some text at the arrow's origin. Often I end up needing to move the text around or because there's not enough room, it ends up on an unreadable background color, etc. When I do so, though, the arrow origin doesn't stick to the text so I'm constantly moving the text, then moving the arrow, then moving the text, then moving the arrow, etc.\nDo you know of any tools that allow the text box to \"stick\" to the arrow's origin so I can more easily make changes this way? \n(It might sound a bit of a nitpick but when I'm marking things up I can easily add 100 or more such annotations in a few-hour session.)\n\nEdited to add: I realize that I might not have been clear enough. Here's an example using the app Napkin. It's the perfect app for this but it has other issues that make it not usable for me (and hasn't been updated in years):\n\n\nA: If you open your images in Apple's Preview, you can use the toolbar to add arrows, and text:\n\nThen you can command-click each of the elements to move them respective of each other's position.\n\nAll of these annotations were done with Apple's Preview. You can do the same thing for PDFs as well.\nAnd of course, taking screenshots are incredible easy in MacOS. cmd-shift-4 with  a space bar afterwards lets you take pics of windows. \n", "Q: How to export Text replacements from the Keyboard System Preference from shell? There are a few users here that use the same replacement text between several machines.

For those looking to make this work, specifically in MacOS Sierra, the standard solution of using a resolver file in /etc/resolver/* actually works, without the need to change network preferences.\nIn my instance, where I wanted my local development domain name to be *.develop, I created a file called develop (no extension) with contents:\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n\nI thought this hadn't worked and that macOS does not read from these files, as I used the command dscacheutil -flushcache and it didn't work. Only a hard restart was enough to kick the system into using the local resolver.\nFor completeness, the content of my dnsmasq.conf file is:\nno-resolv\naddress=/.develop/127.0.0.1\n\n", "Q: Updating iOS, Storage Mystery Math I'd like to update my iPhone Operating System.

I'm looking at the data storage summary at the bottom of itunes.  It says quite clearly that I have 2.48 GB free in the little color bar describing the iPhone.  I need 770 MB, and I have 2.48 GB available, then why, for goodness sake, am I getting that mystery message?  \nWhen I learned math, I thought that 770 MB was a heck of a lot smaller than 2.48 GB.\nNote: There is some other odd stuff going on with this phone's memory display.  I've deleted all the photos from the photo gallery on the phone, yet the data summary bar shows 1.49 GB, 1760 photos.  It should show near zero memory / zero images.  \nNote:  Its possible that Dropbox is messing things up.  I would have thought that the Dropbox memory usage would be accurately reported out on the data usage summary in iTunes. My Dropbox storage capacity is 10GB, of which I typically use 8GB.

I suppose, they did it so you wouldn't feel that you're in \"vacuum\" when you are talking).\nAnyway, the problem is that whenever I connect my headphones to macOS, the system switches from internal microphone to headphones' one. Therefore, noise canceling doesn't work, unless I go to system settings and switch microphone back to the internal one.\nThis is very annoying, especially considering that I have to do that every time I connect headphones.\nIs there any way to force macOS to always use internal microphone, or not to use the specific headphones' one?\nUpdate from 10/2017: \nSo I found out that \"headphones' microphone is being used\" only happens when Skype is running.

Based on this question, I realized I may not be able to set the setting for my mac, but I can set them for my iOS Simulator.\niOS Simulator: Hardware -> Audio Input -> Internal Microphone\n\nA: I still really like @aaplmath's suggestion (and that may be the best one going forward), but I also just stumbled on this solution that requires no coding (AppleScript/Swift/ObjC/Other) in High Sierra, and it's super easy to configure.\nPlease note that the answer was in the comment section of the article and it seems to work on High Sierra (I'm on 10.13.6), but I don't know if this works on Mojave and beyond.\n\nOpen the standard \"Audio MIDI Setup.app\" utility, and click the + at the bottom to create an Aggregate Device. Then select the Internal Microphone as the only component in this aggregate device and select it as the default input. For some reason this prevents Mac OS X from selecting the Bluetooth Microphone from now on and it will stay on the internal one when you reconnect.\nAfter creating that aggregate input, go to your usual System Preferences -> Sound -> Input (tab)\n\nSource: http://ssrubin.com/posts/fixing-macos-bluetooth-headphone-audio-quality-issues-with-hammerspoon.html#comment-4018174387\n\nA: This happened to me on BigSur and it's the worst!  I couldn't figure out and tried everything here, no results.  What worked for me was going in to the Zoom app preferences selecting the internal microphone from the default Bose QC 35 and bingo, no crappy audio.\n\nA: If you use your headphones via cable instead of bluetooth, the simplest solution should be to use a cable with a TRS (Tip + Ring + Sleeve) phone jack instead of a TRRS (Tip + Ring + Ring + Sleeve) phone jack. The TRS phone jack only supports Stereo signal, but no microphone. Thus no microphone signal will be transmitted and the built-in microphone should stay active.\n", "Q: Help with AppleScript moving email messages I have written the script below to move messages from one mailbox to another in Mail.\nBut when I run it, just a few email messages are moved at a time. E.g. if I have 10 messages in the mailbox, only three or four are moved. So I have to run the script multiple times to complete the operation!

I just want to know if this can be done in one command without any interactions in macOS. There's an interactive way to do this (I first switched to the user abc and then switched back so that abc had a hidden desktop):\n(in sudo mode)\nlogin abc\n(type the password)\nscreencapture <png-file-name>\n\nIn my test, this would take a screenshot of abc's hidden desktop and save it to the file. But the weird thing is that when I use -f option (only applicable in sudo mode) to eliminate the need of typing password, the screenshot becomes the current user's desktop, not abc's desktop:\n(in sudo mode)\nlogin -f abc /usr/sbin/screencapture <png-file-name>\nOR\nlogin -f abc bash -c \"/usr/sbin/screencapture <png-file-name>\"\n\nBoth don't work as expected.\nsu or sudo also can't meet my requirements, because they also take the screenshots of current user's desktop.\nYou may wonder why I want that. In fact I don't want the screenshots, I want security. I want to make the shell of this another user completely isolated from the current user, so that any malicious code running in this shell will not be able to take screenshot of the current user.\n\nA: The desktop is managed by the WindowServer daemon.\nThe communication with WindowServer is guarded so that only root and the current console user can access WindowServer.\nBecause you're using sudo, you have root privileges to be able to communicate with WindowServer.\nIn addition to this the current namespace is used to determine, which desktop is \"your desktop\". A session namespace is created for each currently logged in user.\nWhen you use the login command, you're asked to enter your password. This is actually handled by the PAM subsystem. As part of the standard PAM setup on macOS, you're transferred to the correct (your own) session namespace, when logging on with the right password.\nTherefore when you use \"login\" and enter a password, you get a screenshot of that user's desktop because you're in the right namespace.\nHowever, when you use \"login -f\" you're bypassing PAM. Therefore the PAM modules are never executed, and you stay in the same name space you were before.\nTherefore when using \"login -f\" to take the screenshot, you're actually getting a screenshot of the currently logged in user - and not the \"abc\" user you want.\nYou can read more about this in technical note TN2083:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2083/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003794-CH1-SUBSECTION14\n", "Q: iPhone 7 missing Calendar app I read that you can't delete the calendar icon.

Sierra 10.12.4). It works great but occasionally restarts without any warning and sometimes, when I turn it on, this code appears. It is gone if I do a hard shut down and then start it again. I did a hardware test (pressed 'D' on restart) and that hardware test said there were no issues. Thoughts???\nType of ram - Komputerbay 16GB Dual Channel Kit 2x 8GB 204pin DDR3-1600 SO-DIMM 1600/12800S (1600MHz, CL11) for MAC and PC \nImage of error message is attached.\n\nA: If the problem started occurring after installing the RAM, it is most probably caused by the RAM. Issues with RAM can be \"spotty\", meaning that it doesn't necessarily fail all the time - but just randomly or when the system is hot or similar. Therefore the RAM might be flawed even though the system passes the hardware test.\nThe error message in the screen shot shows a page fault within the kernel. This is typically caused by either a bug in the kernel, or a hardware error - usually faulty RAM or bus/CPU errors, but the latter is less likely.\nAs this happens during boot-up and a laptop is usually comprised of only expected hardware components - it is likely to be a hardware error. \nIf you have any external devices plugged into the laptop, for example Thunderbolt or USB devices - try unplugging to see if that solves the problem. Then the cause could be a buggy kernel extension.\nYou can try downgrading to an earlier version of macOS if you're certain it is not a hardware error. If it is a kernel bug, the bug might not exist in earlier versions of macOS.\n", "Q: Program is opening for a quarter of a second and then closing instantly After having this problem for over a month and not succeeding, I am asking you for help.\nSometimes (it is happening irregularly) a program is opening in the dock but closing again after a quarter of a second. I am not able to find out which program it is as it is happening so quickly. \nNow my question: Is there any way to find out which apps (or processes) have been opened in the past minute (so that I can find out which program is responsible for this strange behavior).\nI would be so glad if you could answer my question!\nWith best greetings,\nLeon\n\nA: Open the Console app and leave it running. With the verbosity of recent versions of macOS, I'd be very surprised if the application doesn't leave log entries. Or at the very least the operating system doesn't leave log entries about it.\nYou could also leave a Terminal window open with the command sudo fs_usage | grep open running. This command will give you a list of every single file that is opened on your Mac. Which will be a surprising amount, but if you stop it (hold down CTRL and hit C) and check it immediately after seeing the application appear and disappear you should see what it is and where it is being loaded from.\n\nA: I notice mine doing that a lot and Force Quit did not work. What worked for me was to \"right\" click on the Finder icon and select \"Show all windows\". It will display all the windows it knows as being open. The smaller window icons are ones that it can no longer actually open but has a record of being open. Click on the small ones. Nothing will happen, but it will break the instance of that windows. Then select \"Show all windows\" again and you will see the last windows you selected is no longer listed. Repeat this for all of the smaller window icons until you're left with only large ones. You should be good to go.\n", "Q: non-apple headset on ipad I tried using my non-apple headset on ipad and it worked. This same headset is what I used on my android phone, but when I plugged it on my phone it won't work anymore. There's no headset logo appearing on my screen. Does this have anything to do about plugging the headset to the ipad? \n\nA: No, not as such.\nYou might have damaged the headset or the plug on the Android phone inadvertently, but it is not because you have plugged the headset into an iPad.\n", "Q: Can't switch Firefox windows using command+tilde I prefer using multiple Firefox windows.

Both the windows are in the same space and I don't recall making any changes. \nAny hints on what's happened or how I can rectify this?\n\nA: FWIW, I fixed the problem the following way.\nI noticed that the ⌘+~ stops at a specific window, while works on other Firefox windows.\nI closed that window, then re-opened it via History menu. The effect was gone, and ⌘+~ started working as expected.\n\nA: For me, the problem was that the system shortcut was modified.\nYou should go to:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboard\nMove focus to next window should be checked and contain the correct shortcut.\n", "Q: Photos Library: .photoslibrary file taking double of storage space in Photos app and Document Folder As you can see in the screenshot below the Photos app is using 53,1 GB of the total Disk Storage, but also the Documents Folder has a .photoslibrary file of 50,34 GB. I tried deleting the file from the Documents folder, but then I neither had the photoslibrary in Documents nor any photos in the Photos app. Also, there was round about 100GB more of available storage (both storages of 53,1GB and 50,34GB were gone). When I copied the photoslibrary file back in the Documents Folder, the 100GB were there again (Same Phenomen as before).\nWhat can I do to avoid having two Files using double of the needed storage?\n\n\nA: The reality is that there isn't two files taking up the double storage. The storage is only used once.\nThe view you're looking at is just confusing, since the \"Fotos\" and \"Fotos-Mediathek\" is really one and same.\nYou can open your home folder in finder and select the list view (command 2) and then calculate all folder sizes.

I'm wondering if his Safari is connected to mine and if he can see my history? \nHow do I make sure my Safari bookmarks and history are completely disabled from my Dad's account? \n\nA: Bookmarks etc are synced via iCloud.

Crucially, I want it to be something really simple like the Windows keys that just roll through a bunch of windows, regardless of application.\nPaying £14 for Witch in order to get this functionality is frankly ridiculous, is there an OSX way of doing it?\n\nA: Another possible option for you is to use Mission Control. \nMission Control shows all windows as overlays on your screen. You can also set your Mission Control preferences (Apple > System Preferences > Mission Control) to group windows by application.\nBy default you can access Mission Control by pressing the Mission Control key (usually the F3 key - see image below), or pressing the control + ⬆︎ keyboard shortcut, although this may depend on how you've configured your shortcuts in System Preferences.\n\nIf you're using a MacBook and/or trackpad you can also access Mission Control by swiping up with three fingers.\nFor more information you can refer to Use Mission Control on your Mac.\nNote: The feedback I've had from users is that it takes a little while to get used to, but that it's well worth persisting. So I recommend you stick with it for a little while to see if it works for you.\n\nA: A (currently) free option:\n\n\n*\n\n*HyperSwitch - free beta, expiry date has been extended\n\n\nAnd more paid options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contexts - free trial, then $10\n\n*SuperTab - free trial, then $10\n\n\nContexts seems the most solid solution at the time of writing.\n\nMy Humble Opinion: I tried these apps but always came back to Mission Control + Hot Corner activation. When I want to find a window I move my mouse to the top right corner, all the windows appear on one screen, then I visually select one and click it with my mouse, the desktop comes back with my chosen window activated. Of course, YMMV.\n\n\nA: Witch is an app for switching between windows of any application.\n\nWitch allows you to switch directly between not only applications (as you can do with Command-Tab), but windows as well. Instead of switching applications first, then windows, use Witch to switch directly to your desired window.\n\n\nA: Just tried what Timmy Browne implicitely suggested, and I can confirm that on macOS Mojave, apparently you can switch between windows of the same application with Cmd+~ (while switching between applications with the old good Cmd+Tab combination).\n\nA: AltTab is an aptly-named open source project that provides functionality like Alt+Tab does in Windows (and several Linux window managers for that matter). As of this writing, it supports macOS from version 10.12 to 12 including Apple silicon.\n\nA: Windows switches through all open windows regardless of application.  Mac switches between all open applications and seperately switches through all open applicatition specific windows.   \nOn Both os's using shift changes the direction.\nIt's different, but just as intuitive, to switch between tab and tilde as the keys are adjacent.  I hated it when i switched, but now greatly prefer this method.  It will take a little time to get used to it, but its better than paying 15 bucks to keep the status quo.\nAlternatively, mission control has the option to enable and disable grouping windows by application if you go that route.   But there is no innate shortcut.\n\nA: A workaround is move the windows you want to switch between to another desktop, in that desktop every window belongs to a different application.\n", "Q: Function keys default I have a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Touch Bar shows default buttons for brightness, volume, play/pause, etc.\nI know there is the option to add applications to the shortcut bar in system settings to have the function keys F1…F12 on the Touch Bar, but I want them ALWAYS.\nI need them for programming (and I'm lazy and don't want to change my behaviour — imho it is part of the job of my computer to adapt to me, not the other way around) and so I have added PHPStorm to the apps, showing F1…\nThe problem is, when I'm in my browser, calendar etc. Play, etc. is showing. So I never know whether I have to push Fn or not to pause the music.\nIs there any way to make the display of the Touch Bar consistent?\nAnd consistently showing F1…F12?\n\nA: You can only do that: How to use function keys on MacBook Pro with Touch Bar\n\nFor some apps, you can make the function keys display permanently in\n  Touch Bar:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*In System Preferences, choose Keyboard.\n  \n*Click Shortcuts.\n  \n*From the left sidebar, select Function Keys.\n  \n*Click the “+” symbol, then navigate to the app and select it.\n  \n  \n  Now when you open or switch to this app, Touch Bar always displays the\n  function keys.\n\n", "Q: Clone one Mac and restore it on multiple Macs I am going to setup a bunch of MacBooks Pros with the same settings. I could go through every Mac and install all the programs but here is what I would like to do.\nI would like to setup one Mac with the appropriate settings and programs. Then clone the drive to an external hard drive and then just restore that drive to each and every MacBook.\nI am completely new to this and have messed about in Disk Utility for hours without getting this to work. I have also read a lot of articles online that are way too simplified.\nI actually managed to make an image file of the drive and restore it, but this makes the Mac un-bootable. Basically the Mac gets stuck in an eternal boot loop.\nCould someone with experience please give me a mini tutorial on how to clone one Mac to multiple Macs with an external hard drive?\n\nA: On the Mac that you wanted to clone\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect an external Hard Drive to your Mac.\n\n*Open Time Machine in System Preferences and setup the backup of your system.\nThis may take some hours depending on your type of external drive.\nOn the other Mac where you want to transfer that clone\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the system\n\n*Connect the Time Machine backup disk created earlier\n\n*Power on Mac whilst holding the Command + R buttons. This will take you to recovery.\n\n*Choose Restore from Time Machine backup and press Continue.\n\n\nThis will make an exact clone of the first Mac.\nFor other systems also follow the same steps.\n\nA: Use dd to make a clone of your drive.\ndd will make a bit for bit copy (meaning an exact copy) of the drive; so whatever you have on the source, it will be exactly replicated on the target.  One caveat is that your target must be the same size or larger than the source.\nBefore you begin you will need to know what your disk identifiers are.  Open Terminal and type diskutil list to get a listing of all your connected devices.  Find the drive attached to USB and make a note of it's identifier; it will be /dev/diskX where X is some integer.\n\n*\n\n*Make an image of the source drive.  Using dd make an image and save it to your Desktop to be reused for each clone. I will be using disk5 and your Desktop as examples. Be sure to change these values to whatever is specific to your environment.\nsudo dd if=/dev/rdisk5 of=~/Desktop/source.img bs=1m\nThis copy process may take a while depending on how large your drive is and how fast your USB connection is (USB 2.0 or 3.0).  Once the process has finished, remove your USB source disk and replace it with a target\n\n\n*Create the target from the image.\nsudo dd if=~/Desktop/source.img of=/dev/rdisk5 bs=1m\nOnce that has finished, remove the newly created disk and install in your Mac\n\n\n\n*Repeat Step 2 as necessary\nYou will notice that I used the disk identifier /dev/rdisk; this is not a typo  This allows you to access the \"raw\" device (direct access to the actual disk itself).  This enables faster access to the device.\nRecommendation:  IMO, I wouldn't use a MacBook Pro to do the imaging (steps 2 & 3).  Personally, I would use a desktop PC (Mac Mini works as well) and connect the drive to the secondary SATA port; it will make the process go much, much faster.  Using a cheap PC with FreeBSD or Linux (I prefer FreeBSD), you can use the exact same dd command to image the drive.\n", "Q: Ipad, using safari went to a porn site and now same flashing message keeps jumping up and down and cannot close out Went to a porn site using safari and suddenly a flashing message came to the screen, Big mistake on my part but can it be fixed. \nTwo messages one says Print option and goes up the screen then down to disappear then up again like a jumping jack.

I would like to convert many TIFF files to PDF, keeping the same name and changing only the extension.\nFor JPEG files, the advice was to use the following command:\n\n*\n\n*brew install imagemagick\n\n*convert *.jpg output.pdf\nI am trying to use the Step 2 command for *.TIFF files into *.PDF.\nHowever, despite using the command line to the letter, I am unable to change my 300 files with this single line. In fact, no file is converted at all.\nWould anyone be so kind to provide a helping hand ?\n\nA: The * in convert *.jpg output.pdf expands to the list of inputs. This means the command you were actually running looked like:\nconvert one.jpg two.jpg three.jpg output.pdf\n\nAs you can see from this, that's not what you want, since all the images will be compiled into the output PDF. Also, as the command contains ‘jpg’, it looks for ‘jpg’ files, not ‘tiff’, so you need to change this too.\nTherefore, you need to run that command for each of the inputs.\nfind /path/to/folder -iname \"*.tiff\" -exec convert {} {}.pdf \\;\n\n", "Q: How are Notes Preferences Stored in MacOS?

Since I want to move the backup temporarily, I don't need all of this.\nCan I copy and paste the backup to the external drive, delete the original backup, and then copy and paste the backup back when I have plenty of space?\n\nA: Yes, you can do this. \nHowever, if you have a Time Machine backup1 you should already have these backups included, so you could potentially negate the need to copy the backup twice.\nEither way, I'd do a fresh backup of your iDevice before proceeding.\n1 You should definitely have some sort of backup regime in place, even if it isn't via Time Machine.\n", "Q: Downgrading from iOS 11 to 10.3.2 broke some core apps So, impressed by WWDC as always, this year I decided to update my phone to the iOS 11 Developer Beta on my iPhone 6. After running the install for about two weeks, I decide that things are running a bit too slow - so I chose to downgrade back to 10.3.2 using this guide.\nUsing the above guide may not have been the right course of action - for now some of my major core apps have been broken/bricked, such as Notes, News, and Podcasts.\nI reached out to @AppleSupport on Twitter, and here is the answer they gave me:\n\nWhat we’ll like to do next is restore the software of the iPhone. The restore process will erase the data on the iPhone, and install a fresh copy of 10.3.2. Before restoring, make sure you have a recent backup using iTunes or iCloud since the iPhone will be erased. After the iPhone is restored, let's setup the iPhone as new, and test the Notes app. Once confirmed that you’re able to use Notes as expected, we can put your backup back on the iPhone.\n\nThe reason I am posting this, is that I am trying to avoid that process, and to also tell people that a quick reversion of the OS like how I did was a mistake. \nDoes anyone have any idea how the Notes, News, and Podcasts apps can be fixed without having to do the whole backup/install/restore process suggested by Apple Support?\n\nA: Downgrading to no longer supported (or supported but many bugs Operating Systems) may harm your phone\nYou have to return to iOS 11\n", "Q: Native HEIF support in macOS 10.13 High Sierra?

Has Apple made it easier for devs to shoot down unwanted app reviews since 10.3? (Maybe 10.3.1, but surely around that time I noticed it.)\nI tend to write app reviews that are critical in nature but still constructive and I use a respectful language. I rarely write glooming 5 star reviews however.\nWhat I notice is that eg I write several reviews in the evening and the next morning they are gone. They are not only not showing up in the AppStore but in the list of all of my reviews I can check on my iPhone it appears like I have never written them.\nI use a German AppStore account, review mostly apps made by German devs, and because the deletion of my reviews is sometimes happening so quickly I assume that the devs can delete reviews themselves, right? Can't imagine that Apple hires people in CEST to shoot down reviews within a few hours of writing them.\nCan anyone please explain what's happening? I could understand how devs view their apps as part of their brand and don't want to get it tarnished by non favourable reviews. So if it's that and Apple is cool with that and supports these kind of devs, more power to them.\nI'd just like to know about it so I can eventually think twice about writing an app review when chances are big that it gets deleted as well.\n\nA: Developers can not directly remove reviews but Apple's App Store staff can.\nDevelopers can ask for inflammatory, misleading, or concerning reviews to be removed from the App Store and Mac App Store.\nWhen a new version of an application is released on an Apple App Store, existing reviews can be archived and removed from immediate sight. This may be the behaviour you are seeing.\nRegarding time zones, Apple appear to have review teams covering all time zones. Reviews of newly submitted applications occur on weekends and most holidays. Thus it is reasonable to assume other app store services are available at all times.\n", "Q: Where does the sudo .bashrc file reside? Where doe the sudo .bashrc file reside?

Though there is a project to create turn a USB-C into a MagSafe adapter\nTech accessories usually don't go backwards and it's usually because the old accessories don't have the capability to communicate properly with the new devices (i.e. voltage negotiation with USB-C charging).\nUnfortunately, you will have to get an older charger to support that MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: How do I use this as a mouse?

Is it normal? There are about 10 of 7 of them and are images extremely small.Is it the requirement of system or the leftovers after formatting disks having other OSes?\n\nA: Yes - the recovery HD layers many components to make a bootable system so I would call that normal / intended.\nSince you are booting to a write restricted environment on an OS that typically wants to write log files, cache databases, system settings - those are likely created to be easily discardable without modifying the OS substantially for booting on Recovery HD as opposed to booting from a volume as normal.\n", "Q: Battery Full Alert Is it possible/necessary to configure a \"Battery is full, remove charger notification\" similar to the Low Battery Alert?\nI run macOS Sierra on my computer and wonder what software or scripts or configuration is needed to perform this.\n[Based on an answer, the question has been modified to include if this is necessary since that was the main intention behind the query]\n\nA: This is completely unnecessary.\nAll batteries packs have a something called a battery protection circuit which is designed to disconnect the battery from the charging source once it reaches full capacity and disconnect from the load once it drops to a certain voltage.  Below is a photo from a (circa 2007 MacBook) battery that has been disassembled.\n\nBattery Health Management\nWith the release of Catalina (10.15.5) this is now even more unnecessary as this \"battery preservation\" technology is now baked into the OS; it's called Battery Health Management.  The way it works is that it reduces the maximum charge while plugged in.  The battery icon may show \"Not charging\" and will discharge to around 93% even with the charger connected before charging again. See Apple Support Document About battery health management in Mac notebooks.\nWhen you overcharge a battery, you could damage it and cause it to burn. Without this protection circuit, at minimum you would be drastically shortening the life of your battery and at worst, starting a fire (thermal runaway).\nThere is an excellent YouTube video that shows how a protection circuit works through building one.  There's also an excellent article on HowStuffWorks; Can your laptop battery be overcharged?\n\nA: Additional software is required.\nSee Should I disconnect my MacBook Pro's power cord when the battery is fully charged? for a discussion about getting those most from your laptop's battery.\nBattery Guardian\nDepending on what you want to achieve, Battery Guardian can remind you when to fully discharge a battery.\n\nBeyond an Alert\nIf you want to do more when your battery reaches a specific charge or state, then additional software is needed. One approach is Power Manager, which I am involved with. With Power Manager, you can run scripts and actions based on your Mac's UPS and battery state.\n", "Q: Remove all items from Safari 10.10.1 reading list I wish to remove all sites from the reading list.

However, it appears that this setting is global so that it impacts the setting for my right handed mouse as well.  Is there a way to set this up so that I don't need to order special left-handed hardware?\n\nA: Use ControllerMate\nYou can reprogram virtually any button (keyboard, MIDI key, mouse key, etc.) to carry out any number of pre-defined actions.\n\nReconfigure drivers\nDriver configurations can be used to change the default behavior of a\n  keyboard or mouse that uses ControllerMate's driver.\nAll buttons on a keyboard have some default function or another.

This curve can be one of the standard curves, a standard curve\n  with an adjusted speed or sensitivity, or an entirely custom curve\n  created point by point.\nMultiple configurations can be created for the same keyboard or mouse\n  — use building blocks to control when a configuration is active.\n\n", "Q: Disable F14/F15 for Brightness Control My new iMac (2017, running 10.12.5) has by default F14/F15 bound to control the display brightness. I can't find any way to disable them, which means that binding them to other functions doesn't work. Using a third party tool like Keyboard Maestro can map the keys, but doesn't override the brightness adjustment, so you get two functions at once.\nIn my research it seems that some versions of Mac OS had a Display option under Keyboard Shortcuts that had the applicable options:\n\nUnfortunately I don't have that.\nSo my question is: How do I get that Display section back, or how do I unbind the decrease/increase display brightness shortcuts?\n\nA: The Display section in Keyboard Shortcuts shows up when a third-party (non-Apple) keyboard is attached (I used a USB one, I don't have a wireless one to test). From there I was able to disable the shortcut keys.\nOnce I was able to disable them, I did some digging to find where the preferences are stored behind the scenes. Turns out that they live in ~Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist.\nSetting the enabled property to false for keys 53 through 56 of the AppleSymbolicHotKeys dictionary, will disable the F14/F15 brightness adjustments (this doesn't affect the F1/F2 keys on Apple keyboards).\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:53:enabled false\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:54:enabled false\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:55:enabled false\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:56:enabled false\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n\nThe change will take place after a logout or restart.

The plist keys in the com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist were different. Here are the commands that worked for me:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:7:enabled false\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:12:enabled false\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n\nDon't forget to restart the computer (simply logging out doesn't work). After this is done you'll be free to map these keys.\n\nA: None of these options worked for me. Also the com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist file is for a given user and in my case I had the problem even with Guest account.\nI was able to get Display to show up by removing all my USB devices. Then I was able to uncheck the F14/F15 items. I was even able to plug all my USB devices back in and Display still is displayed, go figure.\n\nA: BetterTouchTool (BTT) v3.737 on macOS 10.14.6 v18G9323 enables me to map the F14 and F15 keys on my Apple, bluetooth keyboard to another function, overriding the brightness function(s).\nNo plist editing, restarting the OS, or anything like that. It \"just works\" for me.\nKey point: be sure to press the fn key in combination with F14 or F15 when define-ing/assigning/(re)mapping the BTT keyboard trigger, otherwise simply pressing F14/F15 keys will simply brighten/darken the display. However, this is a one-time requirement (at BTT trigger-definition time), and from them on the F14/F15 keys are mapped to the new BTT function, at least on my system.\n", "Q: How can I share a Google Drive file to anyone on iOS?

PDFs are quite efficient at containing text — converting to image negates that as you are then just storing images.\nPreview includes a Reduce File Size option for PDFs. Open the PDF with Preview, choose File → Export and select Quartz Filter: Reduce File Size.

But I am using a MacBook Air which is low on space. So is there any way to use Mail app to access my mails without downloading the mails, but only using the app to access the mails on the cloud?\n\nA: It's not possible to prevent Mail downloading emails.\nYou can keep Mail from downloading attachments in Preferences → Accounts → select account → Account Information by setting Download Attachments to None. You will then be prompted to download each attachment individually when you request it.\nTo determine when Mail will delete downloaded attachments, you can go to Preferences → General and set Remove unedited downloads to When Mail Quits. This means when you quit Mail, any attachments you downloaded by clicking on them (if you set the previous setting) will be removed, reclaiming the space.

My question: \nCan anyone confirm or disprove the support of NVMe drives (like the Samsung 960) by the Sintech M.2 PCIe SSD MacBook adapters for macOS Sierra and High Sierra, or would you have any information that could help me confirm or disprove this support?\nBelow are the results of my research so far.\n\nSSDs comparison\n\"Official\" MacBook SSDs\nOfficially supported MacBook SSDs are really expensive. For example, with the Macbook Air/Pro 2013, 2014 and 2015 models:\n\n\n*\n\n*OWC Aura: $299 for 240GB, $399 for 480GB, $649 for 1TB\n\n*IFIXIT: $524 for 256GB, $649 for 512GB, $949 for 1TB.\n\n\nEquivalent PC SSDs\nGlobally, an officially supported MacBook SSD (PCIe M.2 AHCI with a proprietary 12+16pin connector) cost from about $1 to $2 per GB, while equivalent PC SSD (PCIe M.2 AHCI and NVMe with a key M connector) cost from about $0.4 to $1 per GB.\nNVMe:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel 600p: $196 for 512GB (low quality)\n\n*Samsung SSD 960 EVO: $219 for 500GB\n\n*Corsair Force Series MP500: $316 for 480GB\n\n\nAHCI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kingston Digital HyperX Predator: $300 for 480GB\n\n*Samsung SM951: $450 for 512GB\n\n\nSo standard PCIe M.2 devices seems to be up to 3x cheaper than the MacBook PCIe M.2 SSD. Plus, NVMe SSD are globally way faster.\n\nNVMe SSD compatibility?\nConnector adapter\nAt first for the connector, I often seen the  Sintech adapter recommended to use the AHCI SSD above in a MacBook Air/Pro. The product page clearly stipules only compatible with a limited set of AHCI SSDs, but I do not see any reason for these \"incompatibilities\", as there is no other software/hardware standards for the PCIe M.2 AHCI models. It seems they simply give as compatible the list of the AHCI SSDs they've tested, and as incompatible the most known NVMe SSD models.\nInterface compatibility\nThen for the interface, what I understand from AHCI/NVMe is that it is only a controller interface, depending on the system drivers on the MacBook and not on the hardware itself.\nWhich seems to be consistant with:\n\nI emailed the store which sell that adapter and problem is that macOS doesn't support 3rd party NVMe SSDs, but Windows 10 and Linux do.\n-- From a Youtube comment on a upgrade video with a AHCI SSD and the Sintech adapter.\n\nSo Sintech may have given these NVMe SSD as incompatible not because of the adapter incompatibility, but because of the destination OS incompatibility.\nSystem support\nFinally for the system, macOS now support NVMe SSDs, from unofficially OSX El Capitan (with a patch to boot) and natively macOS High Sierra (even as boot, see an article about the NVME support and a confirmation from the Hackintosh community).\nI sent an email to Sintech to get more informations on their adapter. I got a reply with some references (added to this post), but no answer since.\nEdit (23/06):\n\nUnfortunately, we are busy in other projects, and still can't get new system to test it.\n\n\nSimilar researches\nAfter I created this post, I seen there is some people with the same question in other communities, waiting at the same step.

Samsung 950 pro is interesting. But i'm not sure it can use for this model.\n\n\n*trumanhw (12/21/2016):\n\nYou can buy an adapter from M.2 to MBPr or Air for about $20... (...) The REAL question is if the NVMe protocol will be a hiccup (as in, I don't personally know that answer) ... and if it'll get the full speed of the 950. In principle, I don't see why it wouldn't. And I WILL be testing this out.\n\n\n*Fabio (06/10/2017):\n\n[ About the patch ]. It is meant to be used on hackintosh but I think it might work on a macbook pro from 2015 with the adapter and a nvme ssd like the samsung 960/950 evo/pro. If someone tries or has tried it please let me know.\n\n\nA: The short answer is Yes and No, it depends on the Mac model.\nThanks to @gillesaurejac who made the tests with the Sintech adapter and a lot of Mac models running macOS High Sierra.\nHis results are:\n\nSo, as for AHCI PCIe drives, (like the lite-on LGT-512B1P), they work in every 2013-2014-2015-2017 mac, but sleep is a concern with the 2014-2015 macs.\nAs for Apple NVMe drives, (like the Apple SSD SM2024L as found in the 2017 iMacs, or the 24GB fusion drive of the 2015 iMacs), to this date the tests I have done are :\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Mac Pro late 2013 : doesn't work\n  \n*MacBook Air early 2014 : doesn't work\n  \n*Macmini Late 2014 : works\n  \n*MacBook Air early 2015 : works\n  \n*MacBook Pro 15\" early 2015 : works\nAs for non-Apple NVMe drives, (Samsung), to this date the tests I have done are:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Mac Pro late 2013 : doesn't work\n  \n*MacBook Air early 2014 : doesn't work\n  \n*MacBook Air early 2015 : works\n  \n*MacBook Pro 15\" early 2015 : doesn't work\n  \n\n\nA: Please note there's an excellent guide on the MacRumors forum by user Cmd+Q which details how to upgrade your SSD step-by-step. Additionally there is an overview of different Apple SSD connectors as well, which helped me to better understand the different models.\nSummary (from the guide):\n\n\n*\n\n*2013-2014 MacBooks use a non-standard connector (12+16 pins) for the stock SSD that uses PCIe AHCI (OEM drives supposedly based on the Samsung XP941 or SM951)\n\n*Fortunately, there are a number of M.2 NVMe drives and an adapter available that allow for SSD upgrades in these MacBooks\n\n*macOS 10.13 “High Sierra” introduced boot support for NVMe drives that use 512 byte sectors (or LBAs) which opens up a variety of NVMe SSD upgrade options (Samsung, Intel, etc)\n\n*Unfortunately, the stock EFI firmware (or system ROM) in these MacBook comes with an NVMe driver that prevents the MacBook from waking up from hibernation (or deep sleep)\n\n*To address this hibernation issue, the system ROM can either be modified, or hibernation can be disabled on the MacBook by executing “pmset -a standby 0” \n\n*2015 MacBooks can also be upgraded using this guide and do not require firmware modifications or other changes as they presumably all use PCIe NVMe SSDs (like the Samsung PM951 and newer)\n\n*This guide has been successfully tested with a 13” MacBook Pro Late-2013 and an 11” MacBook Air Mid-2013\n\n\nA: Update：I installed a Samsung 970 pro 1TB on macbook pro 13 2015 (A1502). And everything works well so far. Did not encountered the installation problem for PM981. The whole procedure is easy, the only thing you need to do is to format the disk to HFS+ in repaire mode (Command+Option+R) before install High Sierra using network. No usb disk is needed.\nHave not encountered sleep wake problem.\nI'm very happy to see that my macbook has 1TB storage now!\nNotice that: because MacBook Pro 13 2015(A1502) is using PCIE2.0*4.

I have downloaded old versions of Xcode and macOS so I could develop and test an app on my old 1st-gen iPad device.\nI wonder if I can submit a new app which runs on iPad 1 (iOS 5)\nto Apple App Store as of 2017?\n\nA: 32-bit apps will be rejected, but that's not the whole story. Providing the app supports 64-bit, you can provide a 32-bit version alongside in the same app bundle. This way there is a 64-bit version for newer devices/iOS (iOS 11 removes 32-bit app support), but also a 32-bit version for older devices.\nTo add 32-bit and 64-bit support to your app bundle in Xcode, you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*to target iOS 5.1.1. Targeting earlier versions of iOS doesn't support the combined app bundles. Later versions of iOS aren't supported on the iPad 1.\n\n*a version of Xcode which is able to target this iOS and also provide the combined bundle functionality, such as Xcode 5.0.2 or 5.0.3.\n\n*to change your project to build both 32-bit and 64-bit.

Why?\n\n*Are there any other differences between the filenames in /Library/Fonts and the font names in Font Book that I should be aware of?\n\nA: This all stems from how font files have a file name as well as a family name and a full name stored inside the file. The file name is what is seen in Finder when looking at /Library/Fonts, whereas the family name is what is shown at the top level in Font Book (with the added items for the full name shown when you click on the triangle). You can find the full name of a font file from Finder using Get Info.\n                                               \nThis screenshot shows the answer to your point 3. The file is called AmericanTypewriter, but it could be called anything, because the actual font within the file is called American Typewriter and won't be changed by renaming the file.\nTo find a font file given the font listing in Font Book, right click on the font and choose Show in Finder. This will select all the font files which are used to make up this font face.\n                                             \nAppleGothic is not missing from the list of fonts in Font Book, it's just at the bottom, out of alphabetical order.\n                                                      \n\nA: *\n\n*Apple used to sort the font list by placing fonts with 'Foundry names' in their title at the end of the list. So \"Adobe Garamond\", \"ITC New Century Schoolbook\", and \"Apple Gothic\" etc would appear after \"Wingdings\" in the list.\nHowever, they now have stopped doing this. (I've just noticed in Big Sur.)\n\n\n*/Library/Fonts is not the only place where fonts can be stored. There is also /System/Library/Fonts, and the similar Fonts folder in the user account's Library. Nowadays, all OS-bundled fonts are inside the System font folder, and cannot be modified or removed. Grrr.\n\n\n*Fonts have a filename, which is what you see in the Finder, and a 'name' that is used in Font menus. The two can be different.\n\n\n*Possibly.\n", "Q: change metadata tag before importing mp4 into iTunes to Music Video I am a DJ and use record pools to download music and music videos.

That is, select the item and press command I (or you can go to iTunes > Edit > Get Info).

This isn't always the case, sometimes it's shown - sometimes it isn't. \nThe only variable I can think of as to why it now won't show is because I've switched Windows 10 ISOs. \nThe reason I did this is because yesterday the install process probably went the furthest it did. All the files managed to xcopy to the virtual drive, then back onto the C drive - and even showed in the Mac boot screen (which occasionally doesn't happen) - but upon loading the screen instantly went blue and said there was a problem with my boot files and Windows needed to repair. \nSo I downloaded the newest .ISO from Microsoft yesterday.

Sometimes I need to send my traffic to a proxy, sometimes I don't.\nCurrently, I have to go to the settings every time to click it.\nIs there any simple way for me to switch this? For instance, use a shell command to do this.\n\n\nA: Use \"Locations\" under Network Preferences.\n\nSet up a location that has the proxy and then a location that doesn't.  When you want to use the proxy, pick that location and your settings will change.  \n\nA: This can be done with networksetup.\nGet all services:\nnetworksetup -listallnetworkservices\n\nThen with the proper service (e.g Ethernet or the name of your USB 10/100/1000 LAN adapter) enter\nsudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy <networkservice> <domain> <port number> <authenticated> <username> <password>\n\nor\nsudo networksetup -setwebproxy <networkservice> <domain> <port number> <authenticated> <username> <password>\n\nto configure it (which isn't necessary in your case, because you already entered all necessary values).\ne.g.\nsudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy Ethernet 127.0.0.1 18080\nsudo networksetup -setwebproxy Ethernet 127.0.0.1 18080\n\nTo simply toggle it on or off use: \nsudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate networkservice on | off\nsudo networksetup -setwebproxystate networkservice on | off\n\ne.g. \nsudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate Ethernet off\nsudo networksetup -setwebproxystate Ethernet off\n\nman networksetup will reveal other proxy options (gopher, ftp, etc.)\n\nA: Take a look at this page at YourMacGuy about the Terminal command networksetup. Although the page dates from 2008, the command exists and works in macOS Sierra. Perhaps one of the proxy-related commands will work for you. You can always create multiple Locations in System Preferences > Network that can enable or disable the proxy.

Definitely this must be received at least by developers who are admins and are responsible for managing Certificates/Profiles on company production servers. I have a distribution list mailbox for all interested parties and would like to subscribe it to those expiration notification emails.\nThanks for your attention.\nUPDATE 03-Jul-2017:\nI have contacted Apple and they replied with this:\n\nThank you for contacting Apple Developer Program Support. I understand\n  from your email that you would like to receive notifications in regard\n  to expiring certificates.\nBy default, the Team Agent is the only person that will receive\n  notifications.

Is that safe? Will it mess up other programs?\n\nA: There can be security flaws that result from the careless use of /tmp; malicious local users may be able to delete arbitrary files or possibly even run arbitrary code under your user account, depending on how bad the /tmp flaw is. A solution that remains within the char sun_path[104] limit on unix domain sockets (see /usr/include/sys/un.h for the definition) is to create a temporary directory and use that for MPI:\n$ mktemp -d /tmp/mpi-XXXXXXXX\n/tmp/mpi-zUN9SQo6\n\nwhich leaves 86 characters for the socket file to use (104 minus one for the trailing NUL minus 17).\nDepending on where and when you set TMPDIR other programs could easily be messed up, notably tmux or screen that then may not then be able to locate their control socket. If possible, scope the custom TMPDIR setting as close to the MPI calls as possible, e.g. with a shell function or alias along the lines of\nalias mpi4py='TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/mpi-XXXXXXXX) mpi4py'\n\nThis would create a unique temporary directory for each invocation; the directories in /tmp are pruned automatically. If a shared or more persistent directory is needed /var/tmp is typically more suitable\n$ mkdir /var/tmp/mympi\n\nand be sure to confirm the directory did not already exist in the event a far too clever local attacker has already created that directory (unlikely, but this is why mktemp -d was created). Then, in your shell profile the alias might look something like\nalias mpi4py='TMPDIR=/var/tmp/mympi mpi4py'\n\nThis form is again more suitable if there is shared state necessary between different MPI command invocations.\n", "Q: Living / Linked Copy of File without Alias Is it possible to have a linked copy of a file that updates whenever the original is saved?\nThis is mainly for use with Google Drive and SVN, where I need a file to exist in two locations, but not be aliases.\n\nA: Use a hard link with ln in Terminal. A hard link points to the file inode rather than the file location as with a symlink.\n$ touch foo.txt\n$ echo \"this is foo\" > foo.txt\n$ ln foo.txt hardlink\n$ cat hardlink\nthis is foo\n$ mkdir bar\n$ mv foo.txt bar\n$ cat hardlink\nthis is foo\n\nMore on symbolic links vs hard links: https://askubuntu.com/q/108771/562767\n", "Q: Closed laptop lid last night, today it can't boot up I fell asleep to a movie playing last night and woke up to just shut the laptop lid like I always do.

Sometimes, I'll get a notification for an interesting story on the Medium app, tap it, opening the story in Medium, but then get interrupted, so I switch to another app, putting Medium in the background. If I'm especially busy, it may stay backgrounded like this for several hours, until I have time to read the story.\nUnfortunately, what happens when I bring Medium to the front later is that it \"resets\" itself to a default landing page, making it difficult to find the story again (the notification is \"cleared\" by tapping it, so I don't have it to reopen the story.\nThis happens in other apps, too: I open a specific content item, background the app for some time, then returning to it, only to have my content item replaced by whatever default screen the app thinks I should want to look at.\nIs there a way to tell these apps to just open right were I was and stop trying to \"help\" me so darn much?\nI suspect it may have something to do with background refresh or whatever it's called… Thanks in advance.\nEdit: Follow-up: Turning off \"background refresh\" for Medium did not resolve this issue. After leaving an article open in the background overnight, visiting the app this morning \"reset\" itself again to the home screen. There may be nothing for it.\n\nA: This is due to the restrictions iOS places on app developers.\nApps are only allowed to stay open in the background for a few minutes (this saves RAM), so if the developer doesn't have the app save where you were last, the app will reset to its start page. So no, you can't do anything about this.\nThis is why you don't really need to close your apps in the app switcher. \n\nA: use this func on AppDelegate\n func application(_ application: UIApplication, shouldSaveSecureApplicationState coder: NSCoder) -> Bool {\n       return true\n}\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, shouldRestoreSecureApplicationState coder: NSCoder) -> Bool {\n    return true\n}\n\n", "Q: make textedit the default app for new file types Often I download files with funny extensions, like .wnd, .npy, .dat, etc. Is there some way I can make the default app for all files like these, as in files that the system does not already recognize, to be TextEdit?\nEdit  Is there some way to at least let the \"open with\" prompt include TextEdit?\n\n\nA: macOS is a derivative of Unix, in which all things are represented as a text file, and which program is used to open those files is determined by a \"mime type\". On macOS mime type associations are stored inside of the corresponding .app file. For example, the data that describes a Microsoft Word Document's (.doc) attributes (i.e. what type of file it is, what the default icon is, etc.) is stored in Word.app>Contents>Info.plist.\nThe problem this creates is that in order to make all unknown mime types associate with Text Edit.app you would have to manually add their attributes to the Text Edit.app>Contents>Info.plist file, and any new file types you hadn't added would continue to go unrecognized, and would still have no default app to open them.\nThe benefit this has is that since all things in Unix are represented as text files, you can simply Right Click>Open With>Other...>Text Edit.app, and they will always open as a normal text file, regardless of what extension it has. This is of course less convenient than the solution you asked for, but I'm afraid it is, to my knowledge, the closest thing you will be able to achieve.\nEdit: For example, lets say the file type is .foo, you can use Get Info on file.foo, and under the Open With tab use the drop-down menu, and choose Other.... Select TextEdit.app in the Choose Application dialogue. After file.foo's default app has been set, click the Change All... button. From now on all files with the .foo extension will open in TextEdit by default. However, this method presents the same problem as editing the mime-type information directly, in that you will still have to do this for every unknown file type. \nFor TextEdit to show up in the Open With dialogue at all there has to be information about the file type in TextEdit's Info.plist file. When you open the Open With dialogue it reads \"Fetching...\" for a short moment. This is because the system is scanning the Info.plist files of all the apps it knows are installed (or rather, it is scanning the index of those files it made the first time each of those apps were run.) to see if any of them contain info about the type of file you clicked on. It then makes a link to each of the apps whose Info.plist files were found to contain that mime-type, which is the list in the Open With menu.\nUnix systems do not have the ability to set all unrecognized file types to open with a certain app, because by its very nature this would include files with no extension at all. As previously mentioned in Unix all things are seen by the system as text files, meaning if you set all unknown file types to open with TextEdit.app this would include things like the system programmes stored in the /bin/ and /sbin/ folders, and even certain hardware like the HDD. Now suddenly whenever you try to do anything involving system programmes that don't have an extension at best it just opens a TextEdit window full of gibberish, and at worst the system outright stops responding to any input (locks up), stops booting at all, and has to be reinstalled.\n\nA: Right click on file name and choose \"Get Info\" and from the opened window choose \"Open with\" and then choose the default application for your file.\n\nA: Yes. If you select one of the types and do 'get info', cmd-i, you can set default for that file type. At bottom of get info window is an option for which app to use to open that file. You can select textedit from pull down menu. Directly under that is a button that says 'Change All'. If you click that button, textedit will open all files with same extension.  You'll have to do this for each different file type, in your case dat, npy, ...\n", "Q: Does an iPhone throttle its CPU under heavy load? I noticed some Android devices clock down after a while. So they only may perform at peak performance for a single benchmark. Is this also true for iOS devices? How do they behave under heavy load, like exporting a 4K video? Does the performance decrease?\nI know that under high or low temperatures the iPhone will shut itself off. But does it also throttle itself before reaching that point?\n\nA: Ars Technica has run some extensive tests on iPad Air and iPhone 5s finding that:\n\nThe iPhone 5S throttles sharply after about two minutes, while the iPad Air maintains more consistent CPU performance.\n\nThis is likely due to the greater thermal capacity of the iPad Air, given the same CPU.\n\nSimilar tests on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+ demonstrate that the A8 greatly improves on the A7 with respect to maintaining its rated clock speed, while also throttling less aggressively than the A7.\nIt’s still nothing like the straight line Phil Schiller highlighted during the big reveal, however:\n\nTests on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s+ reveal that the A9 improves even further upon the A8:\n\nGenerally, the iPhone+ model throttles later than the standard model due to the larger heat dissipation surface:\n\nSadly they didn’t run similar tests on the A10 Fusion, but it stands to reason that they would follow the same trend, especially thanks to the small cores allowing the big ones to idle more frequently. This of course would not be reflected in intensive tests, but would have an impact in daily use. Since they get more idling time, the big cores also get more opportunity to cool down, and therefore run at peak performance whenever called upon.\nFinally, Ars Technica discovered that Apple’s chips throttle far less aggressively than Qualcomm’s (used in many high-end Android devices):\n\nThe Nexus 4 couldn't even make it through our entire benchmark suite\n  (though it's worth noting that later hardware revisions improved this\n  somewhat—a Rev 1.1 Nexus 4 purchased in May throttled less and ran\n  cooler than our Rev 1.0 Nexus 4 from last November).\n\n\nNot only that, Qualcomm’s chips have been shown to jump down to the LITTLE cores when throttling, which degrades performance even further:\n\nWhen it throttles, it will occasionally switch from the “big” ARM\n  Cortex A57 cores to the “little” ARM Cortex A53 cores. Even though the\n  little cores could generally run at higher clock speeds than the big\n  cores while the test was running, they can process fewer instructions\n  per clock, making them slower overall.\nThe 810 throttles so quickly that the 805 and even the 801 can beat\n  the 810 when performing sustained workloads.\n\n", "Q: How do I reinstall macOS to my Mac after formatting the main drive accidentally? I recently installed Windows to my Mac and I have just formatted my hard drive on windows mistakenly while I was making a new hard drive partition on Windows.

If you disable web searches and Spotlight suggestions and lookup in system preferences, you will still have e.g. updates for currency conversions which cannot be disabled as far as I know (but you could block them e.g. via Little Snitch)\n\n*Safari. Much like Spotlight unless you disable all suggestions.\n\n*Siri and dictation. Dictation has an offline mode, but this might still send usage data to Apple.\n\n*apsd, a daemon facilitating push notification services which maintains a connection to Apple to be notified whenever something is directed at you, e.g. a FaceTime call.

I'm hoping there is still hope in me fixing this since the weekend is here and the earliest I can get a repair appointment is Monday.\nI've been on the iOS 11 Developer Beta for about two weeks now. This morning I decided that I was going to downgrade back to iOS 10. Followed all of the instructions and in a few minutes, my device was being \"updated\" back to iOS 10.3.2. This is where everything went wrong.\nI leave the phone and come back about 20 minutes later to see iTunes says that my phone is in recovery mode and needs to be updated or restored. I click on \"Update\" and it fails and says it needs to be restored. So this time I click on restore, it goes through the whole process and iTunes says that my phone has been restored and it is currently restarting. However, as soon as it restarts I get the same damn prompt again telling me I need to restore or update.\nI do this about 4-5 times with no luck. So next I decide it's time to put the device into DFU mode. Even when my phone is in DFU and I try to restore it to the most recent iOS 10 update I am getting the same problem. iPhone restarts and says I need to connect to iTunes and it's in recovery mode.\nAny suggestions? I'm going crazy trying to figure this out.\n\nA: I would avoid DFU for figuring out what is wrong - it's kind of a last ditch effort to revive a device without a lot of diagnostics or error reporting. Since Apple restricts who can receive betas and asks them to communicate with users on the various seed and beta discussion groups - many people here will decline to engage on beta discussions so you might get better answers on Apple's forums devoted to the beta programs.\nAlso - since you know the firmware is on iOS 11 at this point, why not try reinstalling iOS 11 again to see if the device is still working?\nForegoing that, what happens when you plug the device into iTunes and attempt a restore? \nThat operation is designed to log error conditions, statistics, reasons and many items to log files. From there you would benefit from being able to reach out to Apple support and also have a large audience with experience in restore errors. It could be an unlikely hardware failure or a likely firmware issue where you are now committed to running the beta pending some changes to the software either on the iTunes side or on the iOS side to allow you to go backwards in code version.\nIf other people have this issue, I would suggest asking a new question with specific details like - what version of iTunes and what OS (Mac or windows) and what specific error message you get before you try DFU. As you have acknowledged in the post - recovering from DFU failure is usually with Apple Certified technicians and/ or hardware replacement assuming your PC/Mac and iTunes isn't the cause of the restore issue.\n\nA: I'm posting this here as well since this question is receiving a lot of views.

Click the button and voila!\n\nA: Try installing Reiboot and then follow the below steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone 7 to your computer.\n\n*Enter it to DFU mode with Reiboot.\n\n*Let Reiboot scan it for issues and then fix it.\n\n*Disconnect it and restart it.\n\n", "Q: The difference between clean install from bootable USB flash drive and from the built-in recovery disk I would like to clean install my MacBook Pro (Early 2015) with macOS Sierra which is also already installed up to the latest 10.12.5 version. \nI Googled how to and found the macaw article How to Run a Clean Install of macOS Sierra. This article covers clean installing with a bootable USB flash drive.\nI also found on Apple Support article macOS Sierra: Erase and reinstall macOS as erase and reinstall from the Internet or the built-in recovery disk. I also found the same instruction on Apple Support at How to reinstall macOS. \nI want to do a clean install because of wifi connection issues. I'm currently using internet from an iPad Personal Hotspot. I have difficulty downloading MacOS Sierra on mobile data from Mac App Store or reinstalling from the Internet. Downloading 5GB from a coffee shop is also not convenient. I do have bootable USB flash disk of the original macOS Sierra (when it was first released).\nMay I know the difference between clean install from bootable USB flash drive and from the built-in recovery disk?\n\nA: The short answer is that there is no difference to the end result. The difference lies in the process. \nAs an example, your current USB installer will install macOS Sierra 10.12.0. After installation you will still need to update it via the Mac App Store to get it back to macOS Sierra 10.12.5. \nIf you erase and install from the internet the version installed will already be macOS Sierra 10.12.5.\nYou can also startup from macOS Recovery and may be able to install macOS Sierra again without the need to re-download it.\nBut to answer your question, whatever you do makes no difference to the end result. In this case you just have a number of roads all leading to Rome.\n\nA: In addition, there is no benefit to using a bootable USB or local recovery partition over just using internet recovery unless you already have the installer downloaded or a bootable Mac spare and handy. \n- https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314 - About macOS Recovery\n", "Q: How is Clash of Clans added to the bottom of recent apps? \nIf I swipe it up, it opens Clash of Clans. \nMay I know what feature is this?\n\nA: You're experiencing iOS's proactive suggestions - iOS learns your routine over time, and eventually suggests the apps it thinks you're about to open based on factors like location and time of day.\n", "Q: Set the hostname/computer name for macOS I have a local network at home.

It was slow and clunky so I reformatted the drive. Now I'm trying to reinstall macOS through OS X utilities. It asks me to agree to Yosemite terms and conditions, and when inputting my or my dad's Apple ID and password it says the product is temporarily unavailable. \nI tried creating a bootable USB for macOS Sierra from the Mac desktop we have in the house, however when booting from the USB the screen gives me a circle with a cross in it. \nI believe I may have to purchase Yosemite for my profile before it will work, but I cannot find the item in the App Store. \nIf I buy Snow Leopard instead, will I be able to install it from the utilities? At the moment it tries to install Yosemite.\n\nA: Just to clarify the terminology used: If you ask about \"reinstall macOS\" that would mean macOS \"Sierra\", at least, strictly speaking, older versions of the Macintosh operating system are called Mac OS X.\nThis 2009 MacBook Pro should be able to boot anything from Leopard, Snow Leopard, Yosemite to Sierra. That translate into version numbers as anything from 10.5.7 (9J3050) to 10.11 (and with caveats: also 10.12) can be installed. \nTo install any version of OS X/macOS it is strictly speaking not necessary to provide or even have an AppleID. But you need access to an ***Install.app that is usually downloaded via the AppStore. Once that is downloaded or came otherwise into your possession in full then the app is transferable to other Macs. \nFor the actual install it is possible to create a real external install medium, most users opt for a USB-stick. \nAn application that greatly simplifies the task is DiskMakerX.\nSierra is not officially supported on that machine you have now. It might also be a challenge to request that download from a machine that Apple is no longer supporting or if you want to use the AppStore and have not previously downloaded the installer with the AppleID currently in use. (And now that High Sierra s released a re-download of the Sierra installer seems impossible…)\nThat sign you see on screen when booting an installer with the official version of Sierra shows you that Apple has blacklisted this machine from receiving this upgrade. But Sierra can be installed and works for many more Macs than Apple allows. (Which would be self-evident if the terminology used in the OP's question is accurate.)\nSee this Sierrapatch to help you with that. A 2009 MacBook Pro is listed there as a supported machine, in principle.\nBut be sure to verify your WiFi card is supported before you go that route. That might be the only real deal breaker for Sierra on this hardware. If it had Sierra previously installed and WiFi was working you are good to go with it. \n\"If I buy Snow Leopard[…]?\" As stated above Snow Leopard should work. But there are now certain downsides to be considered for this approach. In terms of performance, security and support, whether from Apple or third party developers, Snow Leopard is not that good of a choice, especially if this machine is going to be used on the net. [Currently Yosemite would be the best pick as it has recently received at least some security updates.] Update: Since the release of High Sierra it has to be presumed that also Yosemite is now some kind of abandonware. A recommendation would therefore move up to 10.11 El Capitan.\n\nA: This is a tough scenario - you need to use an Apple ID that has previously downloaded Yosemite before. This ID is not tied to the machine afterwards in any way. The App Store removes old versions of OS X so it is normal to not find it there. You could build a bootable installer but you'd still have to find a copy of Yosemite which like I said is not in the App Store anymore unless you've previously downloaded it, in which case you'll find it in the 'Purchased' tab.\nIt's also worth noting that an Apple Store could likely do this for you, most of them have old bootable installer copies just for this purpose. Just call ahead to make sure. Purchasing Snow Leopard would work as well, the Snow Leopard disk would install Snow Leopard but be aware you still won't have an upgrade path to Yosemite from the App Store.\n\nA: With help from someone from a Mac forum to which I belong, I solved the problem.\nThe advice was:\n• Boot the 2009 from the Snow Leopard Install DVD I happened to have.\n• Once booted up, choose English as your language.\n• Next go to Disk Utility (in the desktop menubar) and erase the HDD, completely - including the Recovery Partition.\n•Restart from the SL Install DVD a second time and install SL.\nIt worked perfectly, and now on to upgrade it to, I believe, Mavericks.\n\nA: You can create a new Apple ID and try using that new Apple ID, for that,\n\n\n*\n\n*In the four choices you get click \"GET HELP ONLINE\"\n\n*This opens Safari.\n\n*Click iCloud and Sign-In with your Apple ID.\n\n*Now you can go back to installing screen and the downloading will finally work because you have now shown Apple ID you've logged in from your computer.\n\nA: Sierra doesn't run on older 2009 MacBooks.

About 15hrs ago I accidentally logged out of iTunes on our main Mac. I literally realized my error straight away, so logged back in immediately and didn't think anything of it. \nI then redeemed two gift cards and all was good with the world, until I went to quit iTunes. I got a warning saying that iTunes was uploading to the music library and asking me if I really wanted to quit? I cancelled and let it continue because I was going to bed anyway.\nBut today my internet has been painfully slow at times and just now I wanted to chill out and watch Netflix. It was having a hard time connecting and buffering and then I remembered iTunes. So I went back to my Mac to quit it and got the same error! I cancelled it again and then clicked on the little activity icon to see the following:\n\nAt this rate I'll be waiting for days for all this to upload again. \nI don't understand what's happening here? We have two Macs, two iPads and two iPhones. Does this mean accessing my music library has been compromised on all devices while I'm waiting for everything to upload again?\nSurely if we're still logged in on all our other devices iTunes on the main Mac  doesn't need to do all this again? I was only logged out for about half a minute.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I need to wait for iTunes to finish? \n\n*If I quit iTunes,  what does that mean for the other devices in the meantime?\n\n*If I quit iTunes and then launch it again, will it start uploading from the beginning again or will it continue form where it was?\n\n\nA: It all depends on what service you have, be it iTunes Match or Apple Music. This looks more like you have iTunes Match therefore all of you music is accessible from any device.  This would mean that Apple matches what's in your library with what apple already has in it's vast library and any music in your library that Apple doesn't have they upload to the cloud with some exceptions.  If this is the case then I don't think iTunes is actually uploading because you've already got everything in the cloud. I think it's just matching things up.  \n\nDo I need to wait for iTunes to finish?\n\nIf I quit iTunes, what does that mean for the other devices in the meantime?\n\nIf I quit iTunes and then launch it again, will it start uploading from the beginning again or will it continue form where it was?\n\n\n\nNo need to wait for iTunes to finish. Your music should be accessible from your devices if you've already had the service.\nSame goes for if you quit iTunes.\niTunes will continue from where it left off when you quit it. So don't feel like you can't shut it down or turn off the computer.\n\nA: I've never used iTunes for managing a cloud library before, but from my experience with anything cloud, it should be smart enough to pick up from where it left off. As you can see in the pictures you posted, it uploads them one by one. So you should have at least 120 songs already uploaded, which it will check for when it resumes. Otherwise, if you added just one more song to your vast collection, it would start all over. You can check devices that are connected to that account to see what songs already made it over if you want to see if it made any progress, but you should be perfectly fine.\n", "Q: What is the reason the iPhone wipes after a couple of failed password entries? My mac has a feature called FileVault. In theory - if you don't have the password, you can't get access to the files. (Encryption). \nTo me - this feature should be sufficient on the iPhone to not need wipes.  \nBy wiping - I mean the feature under Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Erase Data.\nWhat I see if that after a couple of failed password attempts, the password entry goes into warning mode, then it goes into complete wipe mode. \nWhy do you need wipes and encryption? (My work makes encryption the default and locks it in so you can't change it with a policy). \nWhere this gets concerning is when your kids are playing with your phone, not knowing that they're deleting all your photos. \nMy question is: What is the reason the iPhone wipes after a couple of failed password entries? (ie why offer this feature at all when the phone is completely encrypted?)\n\nA: As the other answer by Rash Mendis pointed out, the reason why your iPhone wipes all data after 10 failed passcode attempts is probably because you enabled said option 'Erase Data' as shown in the screen shot.\nThe motivation behind this is to prevent a thief from accessing your data too easily. I imagine there are still a lot of devices using only a four-digit-code to lock the iPhone, and this is all what prevents anyone from accessing your private messages, contacts, Facebook account, whatever. If your data would not be wiped after some failed attempts, all a thief would need is enough time for (max.) 10.000 attempts (probably less), and your data is compromised. It is quite easy to assume that a criminal would get your data in not too much time.\nWith the erase option on, you have at least a reasonable chance that albeit your phone was stolen, your data might not be accessed. It is basically the same rationale as with entering a wrong credit card PIN; after three (?) attempts your card gets locked.\nAnd finally, if you are certain that your passcode is secure enough, you can still disable the erase option (which I would not recommend, anyway).\n\nA: There is a option in Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Erase Data. Turn it off to stop delete all data after 10 failed passcode attempts. \n \n", "Q: Added a 128GB SSD to 27\" iMac I've added a 128GB SSD to my mid 2011 27\" iMac and replaced the defective original HDD with a new one (1TB).

I want to setup a wireshark group so I can run it without being root.  I tried using the System Preferences tool, Users & Groups, to add a wireshark group but I didn't see anything show up in /etc/group.\nWhere is the group stored if it's not /etc/group.  Do groups set up in User & Groups have any relationship with the chmod/chgrp permissions?\nI installed Wireshark via MacPorts and it doesn't currently set the permissions correctly to run as a normal user. \n\nA: That /etc/group file only exists to let the system function in single user boot mode. I wouldn't rely on it for anything other than a possible sanity check for known system groups.\nYou'll want to use dscl the directory service command line (and associated dsXXX commands to interact with whatever directory services external to the local store) to retrieve group and user information from the database that normal run time changes and lookups happen.\nThe manual page can get you started and then Apple developer documentation and specific sites (like this one and code posted at GitHub ) might be good places for follow on research and questions on syntax / scripting / usage.\nAlso - I would install homebrew and see the output from brew info wireshark which details the tool to script setting up a security group and change permissions on the device(s) Wireshark needs to own for capture.\nIf you're not into that package manager - here's a script that might do the trick.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://gist.github.com/breiter/cbf0307c671f8bc0a7c4\n", "Q: Restoring recovered files from a partition My Mac was previously running Snow Leopard and Mountain Lion. While making a bootable USB installer of El Capitan, the terminal command to restore the image ended up writing over a partition instead of the USB since they both were named \"untitled\". This partition had Snow Leopard along with all of my data. The other partition is working fine.\nNow, I have been able to recover all of my valuable files after purchasing the recovery software but I'm wondering whether I should recover the rest of the files too. The software found literally all of the data on the partition, apps and everything but all of it is under \"lost folders\", somewhat categorized. Is there any way for me to restore this recovered data and go back to the original state of my MacBook?\nOther Info:\nThe thumb drive I was making was for an external SSD. I wasn't planning on making any changes to the current setup of the Mac.\nThis was the guide that I was using: How to make a bootable OS X 10.11 El Capitan installer drive\nThis is what the recovery software is showing:\n\n\n\nI have since renamed the partition to \"OS X el capitan\" since I erased it once.\n\nA: No - the original state had files in specific locations and your recovery shows that that directory structure was lost.\nSo it sent \"all the kings horses and all the kings men\" to collect the parts of Humpty Dumpty but since the location of the parts is missing - it's not clear that even if you retrieved all the pieces - you would be able to get them in the correct places.\nI would advise you restore all the files to a macOS formatted drive and set it aside. When you find you need to search for a specific file or text - you can use spotlight to search that drive for potential matches and copy them over to a place where you would like them to live. It's almost certain that the software you choose has instructions covering exactly how to do this operation in detail.\nTo summarize, data recovery isn't a substitute for a proper backup system. Those record durable and often redundant copies of file location data so you can always put things back where they belong as well as know if any one piece is missing since everything is cataloged \"before the fall.\"\n", "Q: Login to AppStore over cellular data, jump on public wifi, download/install app is \"safe\"?

This would break the connection, so the App store will not recognize that you already connected before, even though you securely connected over TLS (HTTPS)\n", "Q: MacOS Sierra Keyboard layout changes to Windows keyboard layout in Microsoft Remote Desktop I use the most recent version of Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection [v8.0.40] to connect to my Windows PC at work.

But when I try to change the password for the admin account it shows me the following message:\n\nThe server is not available. Change your password when the server becomes available.\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: I looked around into this issue and there must have been an error when the computer was disconnected from the AD (Active Directory) and the domain controller. One thing I read is that reconnecting it back to the AD/server and disconnecting it again will allow you to change your password. That method was discovered from here.

(Turn on iCloud backups etc). \nWhen I try and login to iCloud Drive on my iPad, it asks me to login to iCloud with my password, and then pops up a 2FA verification code entry screen. But the code to enter doesn't come up on my other two devices. \nMy question is: Why isn't my iPad Retina Cloud Drive login 2FA verification code not showing up on my iPhone or Mac?\nEdit: 2FA is enabled on the other two devices. That's how the 2FA notifications mentioned above pop up on the other two devices for other iCloud operations.\n\nA: It turns out you can trigger a 2FA verification code by going to:\niOS10: Settings > iCloud > Password and Security > Get Verification Code\niOS9: Settings > iCloud > [Your name at the top] > Password and Security > Get Verification Code\nNow the challenge here is that the original iPad Retina was limited to iOS9. \nThe other challenge is that the iPad retina running iOS 9 appears to have a 4-character 2FA - whereas my other devices are generating 6-character verification codes. I'll try and solve that somewhere else. \nThere appears to be a trick to get the verification code sent by SMS.\n\nEdit - it turns out it was asking me for the login passcode, not the iCloud verification passcode. Going to give the tick to the other answer to thank them for helping out. \n\nA: Is 2FA enabled on your iPhone and Macbook? If it's only showing up on your iPad then that could mean 2FA is only enabled on your iPad.\n", "Q: reuse Microsoft Office USB stick with 7.9 GB - Error: -69877: Couldn't open device - dd: /dev/disk9: Permission denied I have a USB stick from Microsoft, which was used to ship Office 2016 for Mac.

If you haven't restarted your machine since plugging in the USB drive then I would try that. Once you do, try reformatting the USB.\n\n*Running as root. In Terminal type in sudo su, press enter and then type in your password. Then issue the commands, being careful to type them in exactly as you need.\n\n*Booting into Safe mode. Another method is using Safe Mode, as this should allow you to encounter fewer errors than using terminal as a regular user. To boot into Safe Mode, immediately press and hold the Shift key down after booting up - keep it down until you see the login screen.\nFinally, did you ever interrupt the formatting process at any time? Doing that can pose issues, so booting into Safe Mode is a good option.\nResources: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/4806895?start=0&tstart=0\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/225061/242879 \n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/771326\n\nA: The likely answer is that Microsoft has configured this flash drive as read-only to avoid tampering.

It turned out that I had an empty file at /Users/name/Library/Messages/Attachments, even though that's supposed to be a folder where all of your images get stored. Once I deleted the blank file, photos started working. There's a related discussion here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6601288.\n", "Q: Safe way to cancel shrinking hard drive partition I thought it would be a good idea to create another partition on my hard drive to use as a backup. I opened disk utility and configured the internal hard drive to split half between the OS partition and the backup partition and hit go. Then it started shrinking the OS partition.\nNow, several hours later, I am wondering if it will ever stop. I opened activity monitor and I can see that diskmanagementd process is reading and writing like crazy, but it is only transferring about 3 MB/s. According to my calculations (I have about 500 GB of data on it), it would take me 45 days to complete the shrinking of the drive.\nIs there a safe way of cancelling the process? Will I corrupt my disk and / or data by just killing the disk utility process?\n\nA: Unless there is a  Cancel button that, when pressed, gives a warning that it will revert the current action, wait it out.  \nIf there is no Cancel button, then you have no choice but to wait.\nIf you force it to stop halfway through, your data will be in an uncertain state.\nBTW running a backup to the same storage medium is rather pointless... if the drive goes down it takes your backup with it.\n", "Q: I have a MacBook Air 13\" and I would like to upgrade to OS Sierra I only have 5 GB of storage and I have already installed the installer but how much storage do I need on the HD to install it on there?\n\nA: 15 gb of free space is my general rule for starting an upgrade. However, if you can free more, that’s always better. Since you have the installer, you can deduct that from my 15 gb figure. \nAlso, be sure you have a solid backup and maybe even test it before you install if you know you are potentially going to run out of working space as the installer runs, migrates all apps and settings and then cleans up old and temporary files. \n", "Q: Installing Mavericks 10.9.4 I have a 2011 MBP that I use as a studio computer, with it I use an archaic Mbox2 Pro soundcard with Firewire.\nThe drivers for the soundcard are compatible with Mavericks 10.9.4 (the one in App store is version 10.9.5, which produce some irregular behavior). The OSX version I've used until now is the latest version of Mountain Lion, so I'd like to upgrade.\nIs there any way of downloading an older version of Mavericks (for example 10.9.1) and then use the combo update packages available at the developer site?\n\nA: You can only download it at all if you have it in your Purchase History on the App Store, & even then you'd get 10.9.5\nOther than that, you'd need to find a friend who archives OS versions meticulously.\nIf you can get hold of 10.9.anything, you can then use the combo updater to 10.9.4 from Apple.\n", "Q: Simplest way to capture \"keystroke representation\" to clipboard I'm trying to create a cheatsheet for an application I use frequently. the cheat sheet will contain the shortcut keys so I can know what to type.\nIs there a simple way to capture keystrokes using Mac keyboard symbols into word or pages. Directly copying the combination to clipboard would be even more convenient, or a way to automate this entirely would be the best.\nEg: when I press \"OPTION + COMMAND + P\" it should save ⌥ + ⌘ + P to the clipboard or to the document.\nCan I automate this documentation effort?\n\nA: I wrote a tiny program for you. It'll type out any key combination you type, so after you start it, switch to Word with your mouse. You can exit it at any time with the escape key. I can share the source code if you want, there's not much of it: keystroke_grabber\nIf you want to make it easy to start, you'll have to drag it into the bottom right of the Dock where the trash can is, because it's not \"Appy\" enough to earn a space with the big boys (other apps).\n\nA: I hope there is a nice automation or configuration to do this for you, but I skip the word document entirely and use an app to generate cheat sheets for any running app. You could make a screen capture of the page of all the shortcuts in one step:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.cheatsheetapp.com/CheatSheet/\nThis app runs in the background and when you hold down an option key for a while and don’t press any other key, it generates a complete list of all the possible shortcuts that are available at that exact moment. So this works across any app on your Mac.\nThe downside of this “solution” is potentially you are adding value, sorting or filtering the shortcuts or annotating the results. The upside is it’s really fast and you may not need to make your custom sheet in the first place. \n\nA: There is a 3rd party app named Elite Keylogger. I haven't used it but it's received good reviews. Its used for various purposes including questionable purposes like spying on employees or ones spouse. It claims to record every keystroke. this may be overkill for what you need. they have a free version.\n", "Q: What gamma to use to calibrate MacBook Pro 2016 display? I use the X-Rite i1Display Pro colorimeter to calibrate all my monitors and I want to calibrate my 2016 MacBook Pro, but I'm not sure if I should stick to the 2.2 gamma settings or raise it to the 2.6 DCI-P3 color space gamma settings because apple automatically converts SRGB values into DCI-P3 colors space to perform matching by using Gamma 2.2 while preserving 2.6 for DCI-P3 tagged content. \nDoes anyone know which one is best to use?\n\nA: Very briefly, as it's too long to be a comment, but not authoritative enough to be a full answer...\nI've not worked in P3 at all - but for sRGB, Adobe98 or ProPhoto the general 'rule' is to set your monitor to default & let the i1Profiler handle it from there - I guess for a laptop monitor, that would be done automatically as the OS gives up control to the Profiler.\nIt will usually correctly self-detect your monitor's capabilities.  \nUse the Advanced settings for finer control, especially to use a larger colour Patch Set, which I've found can make quite a difference. [tbh, some of the settings in advanced you will just stare at blankly - for those, just go with default ;)\nYour Photoshop etc workflow should always be set to keep your input profile, so you only ever go to sRGB at 'Export For Web' or the newer 'Export As...'.\nSo long as you allow Photoshop to handle your working space, as sRGB, Adobe98 or ProPhoto [& never set your monitor profile to it! ] then your workflow should be good from start to finish.  \nBTW, your monitor profile is always applied \"live\" to the screen by any colour-management-capable software & should never be in your actual workflow, only in your system Display Prefs, which the Profiler ought to set for you when you save the profile.\nIf you need to regularly output to specific ICC profiles, then make sure they are in ~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Color/Proofing/ & you can soft-proof with gamut warning much more easily.\nIf your output will be to sRGB, then no amount of profiling will actually make it faithfully transition to the rest of the world, because of the range of horribly approximate devices it will be reproduced on.\nProfiling your camera would be a separate QA & would need a ColorChecker Passport etc.\n", "Q: How hot can an iPhone get before displaying a temperature warning? My friend recently left his iPhone out in the sun while swimming at the pool. When he came back, his iPhone was locked with the message \"iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it.\"\n\nNeither of us had ever seen this warning before, despite leaving our phones out in the open before.\nHow hot does an iPhone need to be before displaying a high temperature warning?\n\nA: TL:DR - Don't leave it in the sun.

I've downloaded the .ipsw from iOS 10.3.2 file from ipsw.me. After that, I've put my iPhone in DFU mode and plugged into my Mac (Sierra 10.12.5). iTunes detected the phone in DFU mode, so then I choose the restore option holding option key and selected the .ipsw file downloaded. The iTunes pass through all process of restoring the phone, but right after it ends, the iPhone restart and go back to the DFU mode. I've tried to download the 10.3.1 ipsw version but the same problem occurred. I've no idea how to proceed.\n\nA: The short answer is to reinstall iOS 11 - the longer discussion and answer are covered here.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 7 Plus stuck in recovery mode and can't restore/update even in DFU\nIt appears either iPhones can't go back at all or they can't go back today with the current version of iOS 10, iOS 11 and/or current version of iTunes. The iPad Air 2 is the only device I've tried to revert back to 10 - that succeeded.\nPast that, I could speculate that it's likely this is firmware and/or secure enclave related but I haven't done the engineering work (or seen another release their analysis) yet. For now, I would urge everyone to not install any of APple's current betas on a device they cannot devote to testing and breakage until the presumed fall release. That includes macOS conversion to APFS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS.

The program is cross-platform and it should connect to a MySQL server.\nThe server is set up on the Linux box and it accepts remote connections as I can successfully connect from Windows machines with Connector/C library. The server accepts connection on the standard port 3306.\nHowever, when I try to connect from a Mac laptop (running OS X 10.8) to MySQL a connection is not established. I initially thought that this is due to the fact that my Mac does not display its host name/computer name in the router and therefore the network is confused. But even after applying what was suggested at this link, I still can't connect.\nSo now I'm wondering if OS X is running some kind of firewall where I need to unlock an outgoing port 3306 so that the connection will go through. Or there is some other thing that prevents the connection.\nThe port is open on the router, so there is no issues there.\nSo is there anything I can fix on the Mac side or at least check?\n\nEdit:\nI'm trying to connect using Connector/C from my program compiled with Xcode.

I just feel like the whole shutting down and booting back up puts excess stress on my CPU.\nThe CPU usages all the way to the top for like 5 secs on booting up. Would it be better for my CPU's life if I just used hibernation instead?\nI could use this command I figure: \nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25\n\n\nA: From a hardware perspective there is no functional difference between a shutdown and a hibernate. Both modes completely power off the system, and no energy gets used in either state.  As you noted, the only difference is the way the computer boots back up when you turn it on. However, the stresses that each mode places on the hardware at bootup is, for all practical purposes, exactly the same.\nYou're thinking of your CPU as though it were a car engine or a light bulb; where using it is akin to putting miles or time on it. Electronic components do not experience wear and tear this way. Using them does not \"wear them out\". A transistor bit can be flipped an infinite number of times without issue. The only reasons computer chips fail is because of physical damage (caused by overheating, overvolting, etc.) or extreme age (on the order of many decades).\nThe exception to this rule is your SSD. An SSD has a limited number of write cycles because the transistors must be deliberately overvolted to make the bits \"stick\" through a power loss (causing the physical damage I noted above). Again, however, the difference between a normal boot and resuming from hibernate is practically irrelevant.*\n*Some would argue that saving the hibernation file causes large amounts of data to be written to the SSD, causing more wear. I would counter-argue that pagefile and log file commits during a normal boot make that argument a wash.\n\nA: Interesting question. Computers have a measurement call MTBF or mean time between failure. The more parts something has, the shorter the period between failures. If the computer is off, then it cannot fail during that time. So you will extend the life of your computer by turning off the power when not in use. Hibernation is still on, and helps conserve battery power. Since your disk is not spinning media, shutting off power to it will extend its life. CPU failure will be due to overheating, so if the fan is not coming on when you boot, it is in no danger.\n\nA: CPUs don't really get worn down much from heavy usage, they get worn down from heavy heat. As long as your laptop can properly ventilate itself, I wouldn't worry about high usage. The boot process isn't pure CPU anyway since a lot is being loaded off disk. CPUs are not typically one of the first things to go, but when they go, it's often because of excess heat.\n", "Q: Mount a Time Machine backup disk that will not mount I just plugged in my external hd via USB for a Time Machine backup.

You need to double-tap the home button (Notice it's not double-press, as that activates the app switcher).\nFor more information: Apple introduced this feature for larger-screened iPhonesThis is called Reachability. The feature makes it quicker and easier to reach to content at the top of the screen.This is currently available on the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.\nA double-tap, or -touch, will move the top half of content on the screen down to the bottom half of the screen. You can then tap on a link or button, or scroll through a list or webpage. After tapping on the screen, the content will slide back to its normal position.\n(reference: https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-use-reachability-on-iphone-6-6-plus/)\n", "Q: How to pair Bluetooth mouse with Apple Watch? Can I pair my Bluetooth mouse with Apple Watch? Or, can I get the functionality of a mouse with my Apple Watch?\n\nA: watchOS wasn't designed to be used with a mouse. As such, it does not include mouse drivers or a mouse cursor, and therefore will not pair with a Bluetooth mouse.\n", "Q: Youtube audio has echo in Safari on macOS When watching YouTube videos I get a constant audio problems. The audio always sounds far off and it has a bit of echo to it. The problem is safari specific as the same videos work fine in another browser. Anybody know what is causing this and how to fix it?\nEDIT: The problem appears to occur only when the videos are played at anything other than 1.0x speed.\nI'm using safari 10.1.1\n\nA: It's an old bug in Safari, and it is still present. If it really annoys you, the only suggestion I can come up with is to use Chrome as an alternative.\nLink to reddit discussion\n", "Q: How to install new Netflix on old iPad? I have a 32GB iPad 1 that I have had running for about six years. Recently, there was a virus and I had to reset it. I did so successfully. It has iOS 5.1.1 (9B206) installed.\nIn General > Software Update I see \"iOS 5.1.1 Your software is up to date\".\nWhen I go to the App Store and try to install Netflix, I am informed that \"this application requires iOS 9.0 or later\". Obviously, I can't do so.\nIs there a way to install ANY version of Netflix on my iPad?\n\nA: What version of Netflix is stored with your iTunes Library on your Mac/PC? You could check this to see whether you still have the old version:\n\n\n*\n\n*If so: you can select and sync the Netflix app from your iTunes library to your iPad.\n\n*If not, and you have a Mac: Your Time Machine backup should have backups of all the apps previously downloaded/synced with your iPad. These will be located within your iTunes Library. So you could go back far enough to find a version of the Netflix app that will work with your iPad and restore that version to your iTunes Library. Then select and sync that version to your iPad from within iTunes.\n\n*If not, and you have a PC: Assuming you have past backups of your iTunes Library, you can do the same as above (i.e. copy back a version of the Netflix app that will work with your iPad to your iTunes Library. Then select and sync that version to your iPad from within iTunes.\n\n", "Q: I canceled (control+c) rsync transfer on a large file; will it be picked up if I start over? I am coping a about 5TB of data from a Drobo attacked to a Mac Mini running macOS Sierra to a NAS (FreeNAS). Here's the command I am using:\n\nsudo rsync -a --stats --progress \"/Source\" \"/Destination\"\n\nNeedless to say, it is taking days to complete, even over a 1GB network. Along the way, I had to stop the transfer due to server trouble. I remember explicitly stopping the rsync process using control + c while it was transferring a Parallels virtual hard drive file about 500GB. I later started the process again using the command above but I didn't note which Parallels VM file it stopped on and I want to make sure that the command I am using will pick that file up, despite having canceled the command the first round.\nIf I cancel the rsync command above, do in-flight files just get deleted, and if I run the command above again, will it see those file(s) as new files never transferred?\n\nA: If you use the --partial option, the partially-transfered file is kept, and subsequent transfers should be much faster. It's probably a good idea to use it with large file transfers in general.\n\nA: rsync starts the transfer of each file, or portion by creating a temporary file with a weird file name.  If you use --delete, the next run will notice that temp file is not in the source and remove it.  Since you didn't, the temp file and the old file are still there (because you interrupted before the temp replaced the old version), and so the update will start again without removing the previous partial.\n", "Q: Why use ps -ef check the process every time the pid will change?

I'm a Linux user who bought an iPad. I'm also an Infosec pro who uses the KeePassX password manager. All my passwords are too long to type on the iPad - so I want to use my password manager on iPad. I installed MiniKeePass on the iPad - and with some difficulty (had to type in the password for one service), moved the database (.kdbx) to iPad. I used the export/share functionality to make the kdbx to make it available to MiniKeePass app.\nI'm stuck here. I need to move my Key File too. \nI can't find any way to get the Key File into MiniKeePass. The standard export/share functions don't seem to work for plain text files without extensions. \nAll the advice I got so far is \"Use iTunes\". I'm a Linux user; no Windows / Mac or even Wine. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: The key file has a file extension: .key\nI tested the following with Dropbox and an iPad running iOS 11. I deleted my existing key file for the test:\n\n\n*\n\n*rename your key file with a .key extension\n\n*move the newly renamed key file to a shared folder in a cloud (or anything that the iPad can also access)\n\n*on your iPad, open the app for the folder share and find the key file\n\n*export the key file ...\n\n*one of the options should be \"Open In...\" tap it\n\n*you should get a list of apps you can copy the key file to and one of them should be MiniKeePass, tap it\n\n*this opens MiniKeePass with the key file listed under \"Key Files\"\n\n\nThat should work. Again, I did this from Dropbox, so another folder sharing service might behave differently. \n", "Q: MacBook 12'' 2017 cpu speed: 1.4 GHz but Intel says it's 1.3 GHz The full spec for the 2017 12\" MacBook is an i7 Kaby Lake cpu with 1.4 GHz base frequency and Turbo up to 3.6 GHz. \nVarious articles on the web state that the i7 used is specifically this model: \nIntel i7-7Y75\nLooking this up on Intel Ark shows the base frequency as 1.3 GHz. \nWhy is the stated base frequency on Apple's website higher than the one in Intel Ark? Does Apple use a factory overclock on the i7's in their MacBooks? \n\nA: On desktop, Hyper-threading is a feature of i7. In the low-power laptop segment, they i7/i5 naming is mostly marketing. So the i7-7200 is just a bit lower clocked version of th i7-7600.\nHere a overview on Wikipedia\n\nA: The key phrase that you alluded to was \n\n\"...shows the base frequency as 1.3GHz\"\n\n(emphasis mine).\nFrom the Intel Ark spec sheet link you provided\n\nProcessor Base Frequency\nProcessor Base Frequency describes the rate at which the processor's\n  transistors open and close. The processor base frequency is the\n  operating point where TDP is defined. Frequency is measured in\n  gigahertz (GHz), or billion cycles per second.\n\n(TDP is Thermal Design Power - or the wattage it dissipates with all cores running at normal operating frequency - the \"baseline\" if you will)\nA little bit further in the Specs you will find the following values:\n\nConfigurable TDP-up Frequency           1.60 GHz\nConfigurable TDP-up                     7W\nConfigurable TDP-down Frequency         600 MHz\nConfigurable TDP-down                   3.5 W\n\nWhat this is telling us is that the CPU can be configured up or down by tweaking the speed and TDP values.  It can go up to 1.6 GHz (1.4GHz is within this limit) or down to 600 MHz.  More speed, more heat, more power consumption; less speed, less heat, less power consumption.  It's up to the integrator to decide what makes most sense for them.\nApple made the decision to tweak it to 1.4 GHz.\n", "Q: Is there an alternative to Dropbox which has an smaller CPU overhead Ok, this is not necessarily strictly Mac, however it does affect my Macs differently. \nI have an 5 years old iMac which is ok with Dropbox running all the time, while my brand new MBP (2017) struggle with Dropbox's CPU overhead (struggles is an exaggeration but it does get the fan running at full blast most of the time). I'm a heavy user and have the higher plan, which means there are some files that are constantly being modified, yet I find it extremely annoying to have it happening.\nIs there an alternative which uses less resources?\n\nA: This annoyed me too so I built Rsync Client.  It's like an FTP app but uses rsync, and it only runs when you invoke it, so it's not relentlessly chewing resources. It works with many backend storage service providers, so you control where your data goes.  \n", "Q: Docker & OSX's guest Windows 10 Pro \"doesn't have VT-X/AMD-v enabled.

If yes, where can I read more and why weren't they automatically removed with Security Updates? If not, who has more informations? Where am I supposed to notify Apple of the existance of these? \n\nA: Apple contact options are listed on https://www.apple.com/contact/. Security updates are providing patches to known security issues, they usually do not remove viruses/malware from an already infected systems. \nWith the suspicious files already gone there is no way to analyze what happened to your father's computer, so you may as well move ahead and reinstall everything from scratch. It's probably safest to use Internet Recovery to reduce the risk of restore from an infected Recovery Partition.\n", "Q: How to move mouse with 2 fingers on trackpad?

I've survived for two months or more without my MacBook Pro but I really miss a Windows app called Azuon.  With that, I'd set up a search in ten seconds, start it, and come back a half-hour later to find what would have taken me days with Kayak, SkyScanner, Adioso, Momondo, Matrix, Rome2Rio, etc.\nI did a web search but the only hit was an Italian video that had \"IOS\" in the title but had a MacOS screen for the whole first minute.  I can read Italian, but I can't follow it as audio without the help of lip reading.\nSo, I'm wondering if anyone knows of a way to run Windows apps on IOS.  (Actually run them on IOS, not on a networked Windows host via RDP, Citrix, VNC, etc.)\nI can't even try to port Wine myself, since I don't have anything to run XCode on.\n\nA: There is no Wine or similar for iOS. Besides probably being in conflict with Apple's Guidelines iPhones/iPads are not running on Intel chips so the Windows binaries wouldn't be usable anyway.\nHaving said that, there are apps like Hipmunk, Kayak etc. available for iOS which provide flight search functionality. \n\nA: You need an Intel/AMD chip to run Wine so running on an Apple chip (A7, A8 A9...) is simply not going to happen.\nFrom the Wine FAQ:\n\n2.9.2 Can I use Wine on an older Mac without an Intel chip?\nNo, not even in Linux. Older Macs used PowerPC processors are\n  incompatible with code compiled for x86 (Intel and AMD) processors,\n  unless the code is run under CPU emulation. Wine Is Not a (CPU)\n  Emulator, nor does it include one. The Darwine project was an effort\n  to do just that, but it has not been maintained in many years.\n\nWhile the statement is about PowerPC CPUs, the key here is Wine is not a CPU emulator. Meaning if the CPU isn't supported, it's simply not going to work.  A recompile won't make the missing APIs suddenly available.\nWhile there is some limited support for running on ARM chips, it's pretty much unsupported when it comes to x86 applications:\n\nThis configuration is not supported, but you'll be able to run some\n  Applications. Don't ask for support on winehq.org,\n\nYour best bet is to get TeamViewer, Citrix iOS Receiver (Requires XenDesktop), Microsoft RDP or some other RDP client for iOS and run your app that way.\n\nA: I see no one else has suggested WIneskin!  FInd out more at http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php., or Codeweavers Crossover check out at www.paulthetall.com, or perhaps Wine BOttler, just google it.\n", "Q: How do I reset to default window sizes in MacOS Safari's Responsive Design Mode? I use MacOS Safari's Responsive Design Mode for web development (Command-Option-R or 'Develop' > 'Enter Responsive Design Mode' in the menu.\nI have \"accidentally\" changed the largest window size to a random size (should be 1920 x 1080) by adjusting the horizontal and vertical handles. I would like to reset to 1920 x 1080, but it is very difficult to do by adjusting the handles because of the responsiveness of the controls; it's hard to stop on a specific dimension. Unfortunately, that is the only way I can see to do it, as I can't find a reset control or option anywhere?\nI have searched the menu options and the almighty Google and can't seem to find an answer? I suspect there is .plist I can remove? Could someone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: .This setting is written to Safari's preferences, that are located in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist in dictionary by ResponsiveDesignCustomPresetConfigurations key. So if you need to reset all responsive mode settings - just close Safari and delete that dictionary from prefs .plist file with following terminal command:\ndefaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist ResponsiveDesignCustomPresetConfigurations\n\n\nA: The responsive design mode can be reset by removing the ResponsiveDesignCustomPresetConfigurations in com.apple.Safari.plist. The plist file location depends on the versio OS.\nmacOS 10.15 Catalina (and 10.14)\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy\n\n*Enable Full Disk Access for Terminal\n\n*Run the following command\ndefaults delete ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist ResponsiveDesignCustomPresetConfigurations\n\nIf full disk access is not enabled, the plist file cannot be found, read or written to.\nmacOS 10.13 and earlier\nEditing the file can be done using the plist file in: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist\n", "Q: iPhone has been updated successfully but why is it still stuck on connect to iTunes?

However, it is still stuck on connect to iTunes?\nWhat's wrong? How do I proceed from here?\n\nA: Those versions are no longer signed.\nApple has stopped signing iOS 10.3.1 so it will not work to downgrade to. You need to use iTunes to update back to iOS 10.3.2 and your phone will work again. \n\nA: Maybe the version of iOS you downloaded is corrupt, try to use another computer ( Mac or Windows).\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your iPhone in download mode.\n\n*Open iTunes (in another computer you haven't used to restore this iPhone. Often times, when you download the IPSW from an unnoficial page, iTunes fails.)\n\n*On the new computer open iTunes and connect the iPhone in download mode.\n\n*Select in iTunes the option \"restore\" this iPhone.\n\n*Wait until the official IPSW downloads to iTunes.\n\n*Once downloaded, the last version of iOS (the IPSW) wait as iTunes applies the update to the iPhone.\n", "Q: Which iPad devices support 3 apps on screen at once in iOS 11? In iOS 11, three active apps can be on screen at once. Running the public beta on my iPad Air only shows one active app on screen at a time. I assume the new 2017 iPad Pro devices can show 3 active apps but can any other iPad do that?\n\nA: iPads with 2GB or more memory support split view and slide over (that is, running multiple apps up to 3 and a PIP video in iOS 11 at once). These device includes iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 4, and iPad Pro (all models). Older devices (in your case an iPad Air) doesn’t have that feature.\n\nA: Funny enough, my iPad Pro 12.9” (previous gen) supports split screen and slide over but does not allow 3 apps to be open at the same time (i.e., if I have 2 apps open side-by-side, when I slide another app over from the right, the two currently open apps grey out, and tapping them causes the slide over app to disappear once more). This is clearly unexpected from an iPad Pro, but it could also be only public beta 1. Nonetheless I will feedback if this pattern continues with the next beta update, as I shouldn’t be getting any less of an experience by upgrading to iOS 11 compared to other iPad Pros. \n", "Q: How do I disable Do Not Disturb While Driving in iOS 11 if I'm a passenger? Do Not Disturb While Driving in iOS 11 looks like a helpful feature unless I'm a passenger. How do I disable it if I'm an passenger?\n\nA: If you have a 3D Touch device, 3D Touch the notification on the lock screen and choose the \"I'm not driving\" option.\nIf you have a non-3D Touch device, you will need to long-press the notification and then choose the \"I'm not driving\" option.\n", "Q: Can't select Time Machine disk I've had Time Machine set up on my OSX Server for quite a while, but now that I upgraded my USB storage I can't seem to connect to the server. When I go to Time Machine preferences and click Select Backup Disk... I can see the share as usual. After I select the drive, turn on encryption and click Use Disk, I get asked for my credentials. If I enter the wrong credentials, the dialog shakes as it's supposed to, but when I enter the correct username and password, I'm thrown back to the disk selection screen.\nI've tried turning the Time Machine service on and off, removing and adding the backup location to the service, deleting /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist on the client, but every time the same happens. No info can be found in the console on the client, and the only possibly related lines on the server are from kdc regarding encryption and this line: 26/06/17 23:24:04,130 AppleFileServer[25122]: Logged out 0x7f86da033600.\nAny ideas would be appreciated. Screenshots here.\nAlmost forgot: the client is running 10.12.5, and the server is 10.10.4.\n\nA: This happens with the user does not have permission to write to the share. You can verify this by connecting to the share in the normal way and trying to copy a file to it. The copy will not be allowed, conveyed by the mouse pointer changing to a no-entry sign. To fix, run the Server app and go to the File Sharing section and select your backups share. Then click edit (the pencil) and change \"Everyone Else\" to Read & Write (see screenshot). Now you will be able to successfully copy a file to the share and also the Time Machine setup problem will be fixed.\nYou would think that the Permissions for Backup Service ACL (also shown in screenshot) would take into account the users selected in the Time Machine section but it didn't in my case. Perhaps after adding a new user you need to restart File Sharing or reboot the server then maybe it would work without requiring this extra setting but I haven't tried it.\n\nA: I just had the same experience that I solved by deleting the sparseimage on the server and the client was then able to create a new backup. I did not examine the ownership/permissions settings of the old image, but perhaps that was the issue as mentioned by melhal. \nRenaming or moving the old sparseimage would allow the client to create a new backup while safely retaining the old backup for a while would be a \"safer\" proceedure, but I have other backups to rely on for some history until the new backup is completed.\n", "Q: Why do texts from my computer show that they come from \"myname\"@icloud.com? When I text people from my iPhone, people receive the texts from my cell number. However, when I text people from my laptop, it opens a new contact on their phones from \"myname\"@icloud.com. I can't seem to fix this annoying issue.\n\nA: If you open Messages, then go to Messages -> Preferences -> Accounts -> \"myname\"@icloud.com, you can see the option to select where new conversations are started from. For me it lists my iCloud email, my personal email (which is my iCloud login), and my cell number. Choose your cell number from this list and everything should be OK.\n\nA: Also in the Messages -> Preferences -> Accounts -> \"myname\"@icloud.com, you will see a Checkbox \"Enable this account\". If you never want to use this account for messages, just deselect the Checkbox and the account will be deactivated.\n\nA: What's happening is your computer is using your signed-in Apple account to send iMessages rather than your phone number (iMessages can be sent using your Apple account and an internet connection without a phone number).  Under Messages -> Preferences -> Accounts, you can disable your iCloud email account for iMessages.\n", "Q: any idea what the heck Microsoft is doing with this brew install?

Microsoft seems to have written an installer which relies on Homebrew being installed, so it makes sense to install it first. \n", "Q: Copy screenshot to Google Drive Document This question is related to this one : Mac (OS X 10.9.2) no longer saving screen shots \nIf I use only cmdshift it works as expected, a new image is created on my desktop.

What tools + methods can I use to clean the keyboard keys so they no longer stick?\nOn the older MacBook Pros, you could remove the keys and use compressed air to clean. The newer MacBook Pros don't have enough space to pop them off with a finger nail anymore.\n\nA: You are correct, there is no room to remove the keys now. \nI would highly recommend never trying to remove the key cap from any of the new low travel keyboards. The keys are part of the top case assembly, and are expensive for third party repairs. (And similarly close tolerance on Bluetooth keyboards)\nApple have a very well illustrated procedure now using compressed air only to clean.

I do not write often in English...\nI just upgrade from an old iMac 2011 to the new iMac 4k 2017. I am quite pleased with it, but something's bothering me. \nI have to work in remote desktop on another computer, a Dell Optiplex 3040, Windows 10, in another city. The resolution is not very good (probably because of my own 4K resolution). I tried a few tricks - downgrade my screen resolution with SwitchResX, but it just affect my own screen badly. I tried to adjust the resolution inside of the app (Remote Desktop by Microsoft), but no luck.\nMy question is : if i use an second monitor (not 4k), and display the screen of the MRD on it, could it address the situation ? Could the resolution on the external monitor would look like what I had on my old iMac ?\n\nA: You can dedicate a secondary display to a remote desktop connection by setting Resolution to Native in the Edit window for a saved connection, and selecting Start session in full screen. You might also want to uncheck Use all monitors. If the resolution of the secondary display is suitable for your Windows 10 system, this is likely to work well. When full screen is selected, the session will open on the display containing the primary Microsoft Remote Desktop window.\nYou might be able to improve the appearance of a remote desktop on your primary display by using scaling (there is a Scaling item in the Window menu). The Scale content checkbox in the Edit allows you to change the default value for that. You might find that text is too small if you shrink the window too much, depending on how the Windows 10 system is configured.\n", "Q: Creating a new contact in contact list but it doesn't show I've found lately that whenever I add a new contact it then doesn't show in my contact list either in the app or the phone. If I receive a call from them their name shows and if I want to send a message I can type in their name but I can't search for them if I want to call them for the first time. \nI haven't changed any settings in my phone and wonder how to make this change. \n\nA: Sounds like an issue with contact groups.  There are two places to check.\nFirst from a contacts list screen click \"Groups\" in the top left and see if you have any contact groups that are unchecked.  \nSecond go to Settings > Contacts and see what default account is set.  This effects what group is used when creating new contacts.\n", "Q: How to Uninstall apps or move apps around When I hold my apps down the x does not appear where I can delete apps or move them around I have an iPhone 6s\n\nA: You should either hold your thumb on the app(s) firmer or softer. What happens when you do it now? \nIf it opens a menu with options or simply a menu that allows you to share the app, you're pushing too hard and actually doing Force Touch. \nIf it just sort of wiggles but the X doesn't show up and everything stands still again when you release, then you're not pushing enough and it's just not doing anything. \nBest of luck.\n\nA: Additionally: Apple's own and preinstalled Apps like Mail, Safari, etc cannot be deleted. I personally solved this by just shoving them over to a screen in the very back so they're out of my sight.\n", "Q: How can I move from iOS 11 Developer to iOS 11 Public I’ve been on the developer beta since it came out, but for some stability improvements, I’d like to go to and remain on the public version. How can I move from iOS 11 Developer Beta to iOS 11 Public Beta?\n\nA: *\n\n*Remove any profiles that are in the settings app (general section)  relating to the developer program. \n\n*Enroll the device in the public beta program with a public beta profile. \n\n*Wait for the public beta build to be a newer version than your current Dev beta and then update the device. \n\n\nIf the Dev beta is too new or you never get an available update, you might need to erase and restore / recover the device. Since you ask this early in the 10.11 beta cycle updates should be every couple of weeks for a while. This shift isn’t a given and could break in the future even though it worked a few times in the past. \n\nA: Now that the public beta is released, the public betas and developer betas are the same, except the public beta has a slight delay on each release. You can use the developer beta like a public beta by waiting a few hours after developer beta release, then installing it.\n", "Q: iPhone 7 Plus stuck at Recovery Mode after downgrading from iOS 11 Understand that some people managed to resolve the \"stuck at Recovery Mode\" by installing back the iOS 11.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 7 Plus stuck in recovery mode and can't restore/update even in DFU\nWould someone walk me through the steps in some detail the process of how to do this?\n\nA: Solved it with the following steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually download the IPSW file corresponding to your iPhone model via the links found on Reddit.\n\n*Connect iPhone to Mac/PC\n\n*In iTunes, select the phone and click on \"Upgrade\" with either Opt/Alt (Mac) or Shift (PC) pressed, then select the IPSW file you've just downloaded\n\n*Installation will start and you will be back at iOS 11.\n\n", "Q: How to install Tesserocr on Mac I'm trying to install Tesserocr for python\nI'm not sure what the replacement for apt-get in apt-get install tesseract-ocr libtesseract-dev libleptonica-dev is in this case.

As some noticed in earlier versions (first developer beta), using Field Test Mode to permanently switch your signal rating from bars to numbers (like image below) seems to no longer work (For instructions on how to do this up through iOS 10, see iPhone Field Test mode permanently in iOS 7).\nMy question is, is there a way to enable this, and what is it? I hope to keep this question/answer updated through the beta phase until the final release, or the option reappears.\nThis is a random screen capture with the numbers in the corner (iOS 10):\n\nHere it is, automatically reverted to bars with iOS 11:\n\nEdit June 27: I can’t get the Field Test Mode options to finish loading either; has anyone else been able to? My screen just has the \"connecting...\" circle spinning indefinitely (notice there are bars, not numbers in the top left). If it helps, I’m on AT&T.\n\nEdit July 12: iOS public beta 2 released. Permanent change still it possible, but the options have come back to Field Test Mode:\n\n\nA: Previously you were able to replace the bar signal indicator with the signal numbers instead since the numerical reception indicator is more accurate. But, now all iPhones on the newest version of iOS have only one way to view the numerical reception indicator which does not replace the bar signal indicator permanently.\nYou have to dial the number *3001#12345#*. This will redirect you to the hidden “Field Test Mode” on the iPhone. Then, LTE > Serving Cell Meas > rsrp0.\nThe value under the rsrp0 will be the numerical measurement of the iPhone cellular signal strength in dBm.

I was just migrated from a Windows machine to an Apple, which I was told would be seamless, but it's pretty seamy...\nMy tech (i.e., husband) told me I should drag-and-drop icons to the desktop to create a shortcut, since there's no dropdown-menu item saying \"create shortcut.\"  However, all that did was move the file out of its logical spot into the desktop folder.  That is absolutely not what I want.\nI'm having a hard enough time sorting folders by date or reverse alpha sort.  I don't know whether that's even possible using an Apple, but my first problem is the desktop shortcut.  For ergo-medical reasons, I definitely don't want to be navigating to my favorite folders, and I don't want to move them out of their logical places.  \n\nA: Drag an app to the desktop, and hold both command and option while you release it. This will create a shortcut much like those on Windows.\nYou can also try activating Spotlight (Apple's name for the search functionality) by pressing command + space. You can then type the first letters of the name of the app you need, then press enter to launch it. This could be even ergonomically better, as you don't need access to the desktop or to move your hand to the mouse.\n\nA: If you press Ctrl while clicking in Finder, you will see an option \"Create Alias\" this is the shortcut you're talking about. It will be created in the same folder you are in at the moment. After you have this, you can drag it to your Desktop.\n", "Q: Sudo command takes time to run after Sierra A few days back I updated my iMac from El Capitan to Sierra. I have then noticed that the sudo command is not working properly. When I use something like sudo -v or sudo npm install grunt -g it becomes stuck and doesn't ask for the password immediately, as it takes like 20–30 mins and then shows the password prompt.\nI am not sure is it because of the Sierra update or something else, but this is really annoying me, as I can't install npm packages and other things.\n\nA: After lot of reading and all, I found that AMPPS entry in sudoers file is culprit. \nopen sudoers file using sudo visudo command OR use some editor (take backup of sudoers file before making changes and also read guide to use \"visodo\" )\nI commented 2 lines in my sudoers file and everything is fine now.  \n#%amit ALL= NOPASSWD: /Applications/AMPPS/Ampps.app\n#%amit ALL= NOPASSWD: /Applications/AMPPS/ampps\n\nSimilar experience/solution has been shared by this blogger here,\nYou might not be having AMPPS on your machine so what worked for me, might not work for you.\nPoint to highlight is \"There is something in there in your sudoers file which is causing issue, just find that line\" \n", "Q: USB Keyboard and Mouse not working in Bootcamp Windows 7 installation I installed Windows 7-64 bit on an iMac (27\" late 2012). Mouse and Keyboard worked during the installation process. But now when I'll try to log in into windows, I am stuck on the login screen because my USB keyboard and mouse aren't working. It looked like during the windows installation process that my mac installed the bootcamp drivers correctly (Version 5.1.5621). \nI tried to reinsert the USB mouse/keyboard. Boot without and then insert. Switch the USB ports etc. Any idea how to fix this? \n\nA: How did you install it? Do what you did before but look for a repair option, or if you really want to, choose reinstall or install. I highly suggest to back up your data on your iMac before doing this just in case something does go wrong.\n", "Q: What is difference between network service and network interface I'm a little bit confused about the difference between a network interface and network service. For example, the ifconfig utility documentation talks in terms of the network interface:\n\nifconfig en0\n\nWhile \"networksetup\" is using network service:\n\nnetworksetup -getinfo %network service name%\n\nCan a single network interface have multiple network services?\n\nA: networksetup is the CLI interface for network settings panel in System Preferences.  From the man page:\n\nThe networksetup command is used to configure network settings\n  typically configured in the System Preferences application.\n\nifconfig is the utility to set up a network interface.  From the man page\n\nThe ifconfig utility is used to assign an address to a network\n  interface and/or configure network interface parameters.\n\nWhat you are seeing is two different methods with different nomenclature for the same thing.\nnetworksetup is specific to macOS where ifconfig is more generic and part of the BSD core\nAs to your question...\n\nCan a single network interface have multiple network services?\n\nYes.  For instance, you can have an alias for that interface.  Using actual System Prefs (because it's visually easier), I created a new service called \"Ask Different Demo\" to my existing interface \"Ethernet\"\n\n\nA: In computer networking, a network service is an application running at the network application layer and above, that provides data storage, manipulation, presentation, communication or other capability which is often implemented using a client-server or peer-to-peer architecture based on application layer network protocols.\nEach service is usually provided by a server component running on one or more computers (often a dedicated server computer offering multiple services) and accessed via a network by client components running on other devices. However, the client and server components can both be run on the same machine.\nClients and servers will often have a user interface, and sometimes other hardware associated with it.\n", "Q: What happens when importing a PST file in Outlook for Mac? I recently moved from PC to Mac, and have a legacy of PST archives which I'd like one day to access from the MacOS ecosystem.\nThe folder structure in Outlook for Mac significantly differs from the PC world, in that my standard folder structure is duplicated in \"«account name»\" (residing on the Exchange server) and \"On My Computer\" (not residing on the Exchange server).\nIf I import a PST file, where will the imported data items end up?\n\nA: When you import a .PST Windows file into Office 2016 on the Mac the PST file is imported into a folder under the heading \"On My Computer.\" The folder structure is maintained and nothing is uploaded to your exchange server that I could tell.\nAlso of note is that the data is actually imported, where on Windows the PST file is used as a read/write data store.\nYou also seem to have access to the calendar and contacts data if that was exported as well.\n", "Q: cmd+del acts like opt+cmd+del For some unknown reason my Mac deletes permanently when I hit ⌘+⌫. Normally ⌘+⌫ is to move to Trash and ⌥+⌘+⌫ is the one to delete for good. Can't figure out how to make it work 'normal' again?\n\nA: Probably your trash folder is broken. There are a lot of solutions of this problem in the internet, but in short you may need to remove your trash folder sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash and let Finder create a new one by restarting your Mac.\n", "Q: ifconfig showing ipv6 address while networksetup doesn't when using ipconfig utility, it's showing ipv6 address:\n\ninet6 fe80::1c00:23f2:b82e:fc8c%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x4\n\nBut when using \n\nnetworksetup -getinfo %networ service name%\n\nit returns:\n\nIPv6: Automatic\nIPv6 IP address: none\nIPv6 Router: none\n\nSame when using ipconfig\n\nipconfig getv6packet en0\n\nit returns nothing. so do I have IPv6 address or not?\n\nA: Your system does have an IPv6 address though it's not really usable for networking beyond the local subnet. fe80::1c00:23f2:b82e:fc8c is a fe80::/10 link-local unicast address\n\nLink-Local addresses are designed to be used for addressing on a\nsingle link for purposes such as automatic address configuration,\nneighbor discovery, or when no routers are present.\nRouters must not forward any packets with Link-Local source or\ndestination addresses to other links.\n\nso what you have is a sort of a bootstrap IP address, not something that can communicate with other systems on the Internet. If IPv6 was working, typically SLAAC or DHCPv6 would give additional IP addresses (and routes would be setup) for your system to use. These would not be fe80::/10 addresses.\nOn a SLAAC subnet, IPv6 configuration might look something like\n$ ifconfig en0 | grep inet6\n    inet6 fe80::4a69:97ff:fe77:a706%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4 \n    inet6 2607:...:4a69:97ff:fe77:a706 prefixlen 64 autoconf \n    inet6 2607:...:6061:4f35:9b95:c7d4 prefixlen 64 autoconf temporary\n$ ipconfig getv6packet en0\n$ \n\ngetv6packet shows nothing as SLAAC is being used, and there is no DHCPv6 packet associated with that protocol. networksetup does not appear to print anything useful when SLAAC is in use (this is on a Mac OS X 10.11 system).\n$ networksetup -getinfo Ethernet | grep IPv6\nIPv6: Automatic\nIPv6 IP address: none\nIPv6 Router: none\n$ \n\n", "Q: \"Disk not ejected correctly\" msg from 2016 MacBook laptop I sometimes use the laptop periodically throughout day without unplugging it or the external drives.  However, if it puts itself to sleep as a result of a period of inactivity, when I reawaken it, I get the message \"Disk not ejected correctly\"    How can I get rid of this message as I have not removed the disks at all, the data is not corrupted, and I have not told the computer to go to sleep!\n\nA: If I remember correctly, to completely get rid of the message, you can go to System Preferences -> Energy Saver and uncheck the box that says \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\". That will eliminate the message, but it also means that your computer will use more energy and that the hard drives will be on and spinning constantly.\nIf this doesn't work, let me know. (Disclaimer: It's possible this won't work; I can't remember if \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\" works only for internal drives or also for external ones.)\n", "Q: Refresh timing of Google Contacts Sync on iOS? I'm working on a CRM (based on web application), using Google Contacts API.\nMy iPhone’s contacts are linked through my Gmail account. \nI tried to find the refresh timing between my iPhone’s contacts and the Google servers, but I can’t find it.\nDoes anyone know what it is? Under Settings, it says: New data will be pushed to your iPhone from the server when possible.\n\n\nA: Your Gmail account is setup to use Fetch, which you have scheduled Every 30 minutes.\nYour iPhone will thus sync contacts with your Gmail account every 30 minutes. You may set this to Every 15 minutes if you would like more responsiveness. Note that it may then take up to 15 minutes for your contacts to update, although it could happen much faster. \nNew data will be pushed to your iPhone from the server when possible is only an explanation for what Push does, and not a blanket statement for every account you have setup.\nAs you can see from the list underneath it, only iCloud is configured to use Push updates. Holiday Calendar and Gmail are both configured to use Fetch, which operates on the schedule you select at the bottom.\nThe reason for this is iOS simply does not support Push with Gmail. In fact as of iOS 10 you can only use IMAP Push with iCloud and Yahoo accounts. Apple has never explained this limitation, which does not exist on macOS. It is possible there was a partnership between Apple and Yahoo, since Steve Jobs made a big deal out of providing Push email with Yahoo during the iPhone’s original reveal.\nHowever, as of  iOS 11 it appears that any IMAP server that supports IDLE (including Gmail) will finally work with Push.\n", "Q: How to manage newer Ruby installations in macOS without intervening with the default Ruby installations? macOS comes with some default ruby installations, more here, that I do not want to overwrite by running gems commands as sudo.

However, it stopped recognising the keyboard and trackpad. \nAs a workaround I tried using an external keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse but now it won't even turn on. \nI don't know if the power button is faulty or not, but I know the battery is definitely charged. \nI tried taking out each of the RAM modules but that made no difference, so either they're both fried or this isn't the problem. I also tried using the SSD/HDD but it still won't turn on. Even the white light that turns on at start up or during sleep won't turn on. Absolutely nothing.\nHow can I troubleshoot this further? \nEdit: After it failed to detect the keyboard/track pad,  I did put the old Hdd back in. So when it stopped turning on at all,  it had the original hdd in it. \nAlso important : I had to reset the date (back to 2015) in order to be able to install El Capitan. Otherwise, it showed the error,  'this file can't be verified and may have been corrupted or tampered with' \n\nA: Take out the SSD and put in the original hard drive, see if it will work then. If not, take it to an Apple Store. They will run a diagnostic to see what's wrong. Don't tell them you've opened it yourself and don't leave in the SSD otherwise they're gonna tell you the warranty is voided. BTW in case you're a smoker, I would also recommend cleaning the inside.\n\nA: The suggestion in Mark D's answer is a good one as it helps you eliminate one very obvious possibility, although it's not clear to me whether you may have already tried this as you state I also tried using the SSD/HDD but it still won't turn on.\nAlthough you're not sure whether the physical power button is faulty, I would still try resetting the SMC to determine if this has any impact. \nIMPORTANT!\nIt's not clear which 2009 model MacBook you have, as some models had a built-in battery and others had a removable battery. Below are instructions for both scenarios - so choose the one that applies in your case!\nBuilt-in battery instructions\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac\n\n*Unplug the power cable from your Mac\n\n*For 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the shiftcontroloption keys (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*After 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button \n\n*Plug in the power cable\n\n*Turn your Mac back on with the power button.\n\n\nRemovable battery instructions\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Disconnect the power cable from the computer\n\n*Remove the battery\n\n*Press the power button for 5 seconds and release\n\n*Put the battery back in\n\n*Reconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nOnce you've taken the appropriate steps, see if you can power up the MacBook. If you can, I would then also reset the NVRAM as follows:\nReset the NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset this in your MacBook:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again (i.e. a 2nd time) and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nAfter trying the above, let us know how you go.\n", "Q: createinstallmedia: cannot execute binary file I have downloaded the Sierra Installer from the App Store and I would like to make a bootable thumbdrive out of it.\nI tried using the createinstallmedia binary that the installer ships with but got the following error:\n/Applications/Install macOS Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia: cannot execute binary file\n\nWhat happened?

I access this on a Mac with the latest macOS.\nWhile I can connect to the internet with all browsers and some other applications like Spotify and Skype, I cannot use FTP, SQL or VPN clients, and I also can't use Steam, battle.net or TeamSpeak. For all of the latter, the connection always times out and I cannot connect to any of those services.\nThe odd thing is that in any other wi-fi network, all of those applications work perfectly fine on my computer. I've already contacted the wi-fi network's support, but they're just as baffled as me and claim that all other users on the network can use those applications without problems.\nI've already tried pretty much anything I could think of (system reboot, system update, logging on as a different user, turning off all kinds of firewalls, etc), but nothing helped.\nDoes anyone have an idea why some applications can connect to the internet perfectly fine on macOS, while others cannot?\n\nA: Together with support, I found the solution. All other protocols worked on LAN but not on wi-fi, and there was just a rudimentary setting which didn't allow the other protocols on wi-fi (unfortunately I don't know the details, as it was the support who solved it, not me).  \n", "Q: iPad apps randomly going gray screen or Home Apps on my iPad 2 are randomly switching to a gray or black screen or dropping me back on the Home screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*I am on a slow wifi connection\n\n*All accessibility features are turned off\n\n*Battery is charging normal and is fully power\n\n*Problem happens whether charger is connected or not\n\n*Problem affects all apps\n\n\nHow can I diagnose and/or solve this?\nI'm less interested in \"just reset / reboot\" and more interested to know how it happens and / or if there's a remedy.\n\nA: The iPad 2 is an old device. This lends itself to many crashes. \nWhat you are describing are app crashes. It happens on all devices, but much more frequently on older devices. Since the apps have been updated for never iOS versions, like iOS 10, the iPad is not technically supported by the apps that you're trying to use. \nAlso, having some extra storage space never hurts, so try deleting some apps to clear up some space.\nBeyond deleting apps, the only advice I can give you here is to upgrade to a newer device.

All iCloud data is protected at rest minimally by encryption as described in the security white paper Apple publishes regularly.\n\nEach file is broken into chunks and encrypted by iCloud using AES-128 and a key derived from each chunk’s contents that utilizes SHA-256. The keys, and the file’s metadata, are stored by Apple in the user’s iCloud account. The encrypted chunks of the file are stored, without any user-identifying information, using third-party storage services, such as Amazon S3 and Windows Azure.\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf - Page 44\niCloud Drive and CloudKit data have additional layer(s) of encryption / keys added, but for notes you get the described level of security where data is encrypted before it leaves the device and hits the network.\nThe local password feature is solely to prevent access of the note on your device(s) once the note is retrieved from the cloud.\n", "Q: Is it possible to lock all notes, and automatically lock new notes, on Notes app? I see that it's possible to password protect specific notes\nI wonder if this can be done automatically to new notes so that I don't need to do it every time, if I want encrypted notes\nIs it possible to lock all notes, and automatically lock new notes, on Notes app?\n\nA: No, you can't set all notes to be locked. But that doesn't mean they're not all encrypted.\nIf you scroll ALL the way down in Passcode settings (if you have a passcode), you'll see a little line of text that says Data protection is enabled.\nThat means everything on your device is encrypted with your passcode. That's why Apple can't unlock it for you - it's silently encrypted.\nTherefore, all your notes (if you have a passcode) are already encrypted. Adding a lock is an extra layer, but you can't add a lock automatically.\nIf you'd like notes to automatically lock, feel free to send apple some feedback at apple.com/feedback\n", "Q: Blank windows in some apps in macOS as guest OS in Parallels virtual machine When running Parallels 12.2.0 with macOS Sierra as the guest OS, I see windows that are blank, partially blank, or scaled improperly (zoomed in, magnified) in some apps such as non-Safari web browsers (Firefox, Opera, etc.). The behavior is consistent, either working properly all the time or improperly all the time.\nI am guessing that apps handling their own window-drawing rather calling upon Apple's usual drawing libraries is the cause of the bug.\nIs there any trick to getting the contents of these apps’ windows to appear correctly?\nBad\nBrave 0.18.14 browser\n\nFirefox 54.0.1\n\nGood\nIn contrast, some apps including some web browsers draw properly.\nSafari 10.1.2 browser\n\nVivaldi 1.6.689.40 browser\n\n\nA: I don't think your guess is correct no - there's no requirement to use Apple's drawing libraries for stuff to work in Parallels.\nHowever, it does seem likely that these programs that don't work are 3D-accelerated and you have problems with 3D-acceleration (which is a known problem-area for programs like Parallels). Therefore try disabling 3D acceleration in the Parallels settings for the virtual machine, reboot the virtual machine and your programs should work again.\n", "Q: Using external USB hard drives via a USB hub connected to a MacBook Air If I want to connect 2 usb external hard drives at the same time, will I be able to use a USB hub?

By a powered USB hub I mean one that has its own power source. This way you're not relying on the MacBook Air to power the USB hub and two external hard drives simultaneously.\n", "Q: How do I remove /etc/nologin I was perusing man pages for fun, as I often do when bored, and happened to be playing around with login today. The login man page mentioned that creating a /etc/nologin file would prevent a user from logging in. I decided to try it. \nThe good new is it works as advertised. The bad news is I can no longer use the Terminal. I can't remove the file with rm for obvious reasons, and I can't even delete it from Finder because I can't see hidden files.\nHow do I regain control of my system?\n\nA: Power down the system (using the standard Shut Down in the Apple menu) and then start it up again. Shutdown should remove the nologin file for you.\n\nA: If you have another admin user on that Mac you can open a shell as that user and rely on sudo.  If not, boot to single user mode and remove the file. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201573\n", "Q: How do I get my Mac to do nothing when I insert a cd? I recently got an older MacBook Pro that has an optical drive.

Now, \n\n\n*\n\n*Power indicator does not work.\n\n*Doesn't sleep after lid close.\n\n*Doesn't wake up after lid open.\n\n*Sometimes doesn't wake up for Any Key press or Power Button Press\n\n\nMacBook Pro, Mid 2012, macOS Sierra\n\nA: The process outlined in the article you linked to is incorrect for your MacBook Pro.\nFor your particular model of MacBook Pro, you really should follow this process to reset the SMC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac\n\n*Unplug the power cable from your Mac\n\n*For 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the shiftcontroloption keys (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*After 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button \n\n*Plug in the power cable\n\n*Turn your Mac back on with the power button.\n\n\nI would try doing this and testing to see if that resolves your issues.\n[EDIT]\nSince resetting the SMC didn't resolve the issue, it's also worth trying a few more troubleshooting steps.\nResetting the NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you also resetting this. There's a couple of ways you can do this, but for your model I recommend the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again (i.e. a 2nd time) and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nNow test the MBP for a change in its behaviour. If you're still experiencing problems, then try booting into Safe Mode.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. is the power indicator working, does it go to sleep when closing the lid, etc)\n\n*Now exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Test the MBP again to see if there's any change in its behaviour.\n\n\nIf the problem is still persistent in Safe Mode, then we should test your hardware with Apple Hardware Test.\nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYour model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\n", "Q: What was the name of the typeface used on the Mac OS 9/OS X Cheeta/Jaguar packaging? I am curious as to what typeface was used on the Mac OS 9 & early Mac OS X boxes. Where it reads \"Installing Mac OS 9\". The slopes of the letters are slightly different than any font that comes pre-installed on a modern Mac, and the 9 is obviously quite unique looking. If anyone is aware of the typeface name please let me know. Danke. \n\nA: The font being used is Apple Garamond. This was used by Apple as one of its corporate fonts since the Mac was first launched in 1984 up until the early 2000s.\nFor more information on this and other typefaces used by Apple, refer to Typography of Apple Inc. \n", "Q: Can I remote install OS X via dmg? I'm having a lot of trouble finding anything that can help with my specific issue, and it really bugs me because I feel like I cannot be the first person to try and figure this out.\nI have one of the new 2016 Touch Bar MacBook Pros that I need to reinstall macOS. Typically whenever I need to reinstall OS X I just use my external SSD with a preinstalled El Capitan and run the DMG after some configuring, but with the latest MBP I've realized that I have to use Sierra since El Capitan is not supported. I only have about 1gb left of free space on my external SSD so I can't just upgrade to Sierra and go from there. \nIs it possible to host my Sierra DMG on my local network via something like OS X Server or DeployStudio on my other Mac? \nThat way I can just hold the Option key down as I boot up and connect to my Wi-Fi network and have it \"see\" the hosted image like a NetInstall or something similar.\n\nA: What you propose works just fine on Mac OS Sierra with HFS + filesystems. Both deploy studio and server.app work fine for network installs. \nWhether this continues for High Sierra and APFS remains to be seen, but OS at 10.12.5 and lower all include network install functionality in addition to network boot and the setup steps are well documented publicly for both. \nThe only wrinkle added for 10.12 is the touch bar and EFI component. As long as your Mac can connect to both the NetBoot server and Apple's servers you will be prompted to update the Touch Bar if needed. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207567\nIf you can’t do that, plain old internet recovery might be better for your situation. \n", "Q: Apple Developer forum - Not able to log in into Developer forum I am not able to login into apple developer forum every time it takes me to create a new user account page and the displays the error, I have successfully validated with multiple user name as below screen shot -\n\nwhen i try to hit submit it gives me below error -\n\nI have already reported it to apple using bug reporter with id 27240362  but there is no response from their side.

This is true for directories, but grep still inspects the contents of files that are symlinks.\nFor instance, if I have a framework with the following structure:\n+-- MyFancy.framework\n    +-- MyFancy              (symlink to ./Versions/A/MyFancy)\n    +-- Versions\n        +-- A\n            +-- MyFancy      (the actual binary file)\n        +-- Current\n            +-- MyFancy      (symlink to ../A/MyFancy)\n\ngrep -r \"string\" MyFancy.framework prints:\nBinary file ./MyFancy matches\nBinary file ./Versions/A/MyFancy matches\nBinary file ./Versions/Current/MyFancy matches\n\nThis causes the search in such structures three times slower.\nHow can I make grep exclude symlinks?\n\nA: MacOS ships with BSD grep which doesn't seem to support a way to ignore symlinks. You can install GNU grep. Run it with the 'r' flag and it will ignore symlinks.\n# Install GNU grep\nbrew install grep\n\n# Run GNU grep, ignore symlinks.\n# Brew doesn't replace system grep, GNU grep needs to be called with 2 g's.\nggrep -rl mypattern\n\n# Run GNU grep, follow symlinks\nggrep -Rl mypattern\n\n\nA: If you look at the man page for grep, there is no option to exclude symlinks, and therefore an alternative method will need to be applied. One such method is to use find to output only file pathnames using the -type t option, where t is set to f for regular file.\nExample:\n find . -type f -exec grep -l 'search' {} \\; \n\nWhere 'search' is whatever you're greping for, and the output will be the relative path filename of the file(s) containing it because of using -l with grep.\nIn the example above, grep will be executed for each relative path filename that find passes to -exec. As grep can handle multiple filenames, you can change the ;, at the end of the command, to + to tell find to pass all the matching filenames to grep at once. Note that if the number of matching filenames is large, then the allowable length of the command line could be exceeded.\nAlso note that find has a rather large set of options, and as such you may be able to narrow down the output passed grep, depending on your needs.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 8,1 not charging A week ago, I found an old MacBook Pro 8,1 (13” MacBook Pro, Late 2011).

You could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have Apple replace the battery for you. However, since your laptop is most likely out of warranty after 6 years, this will cost you a pretty penny.\n\n*Buy a replacement battery and replace it yourself using these instructions from iFixit. The procedure is rated as easy and the page includes a video guide.\n\n*Use that laptop as a desktop replacement (permanently plugged-in). You’ll need to be extra careful to avoid data loss, considering the MagSafe connector will come unplugged very easily.

Seems like there are around 5,000 wifi logs, each 2MB each, totaling nearly 10GB on my disk in /private/tmp. Can I delete these logs, or will macOS automatically delete them itself? I tried making a file using the mkfile command until I had about 2GB of disk space left, but nothing was automatically cleared.\n\nA: In the standard configuration, launchd will run the \"periodic-daily\" script once a day with a low priority. The periodic-daily script will run the /etc/periodic/daily/110.clean-tmps script, which in turn removes the files in /tmp (which is the same as /private/tmp) that haven't been accessed for 3 days.\nSo normally these log files will be deleted every 3 days, unless ofcourse something is still writing to them - or you yourself are opening them all the time to check them.\nYou do not specify the file name of the files you're worrying about.

The current script is below:\non run\n    tell me to open {choose folder}\nend run\n\non open droppedItems\n    set destFolder to choose folder with prompt \"Select Output Folder\"\n    repeat with anItem in droppedItems\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            -- Make sure each item is processed by this script is a folder\n            if class of item anItem is not folder then\n                -- Not a folder, notify the user of the error\n                display dialog \"Please drop folders containing images\"\n            else\n                -- A folder, get the Adobe Photoshop files and process them\n                set fileList to (every file of anItem) as alias list\n            end if\n        end tell\n        HPConvert(fileList, destFolder)\n    end repeat\nend open\n\n-- fileList is a list of aliases to Photoshop files\n-- destFolder is an alias to a folder where the converted TIFFs are to be saved\non HPConvert(fileList, destFolder)\n    set destPath to destFolder as string\n    repeat with aFile in fileList\n        tell application \"Finder\" to set fileName to name of aFile\n        set newFilePath to destPath & fileName\n        tell application \"Adobe Photoshop CC 2015\"\n            open aFile\n            convert to profile \"CGATS21_CRPC6 V2\" intent absolute colorimetric with dithering\n            save current document in file newFilePath as TIFF with options {embed color profile:true, save layers:true, save spot colors:true} appending lowercase extension\n            close current document saving no\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend HPConvert\n\n\nA: The problem appears to be the tiff options.\nIt's missing in the front of the object class:TIFF save options,\nThat line as a whole (as it should be):\nsave current document in file newFilePath as TIFF with options {class:TIFF save options, embed color profile:true, save layers:true, save spot colors:true} appending lowercase extension\n\nHow I figured it out:\nStep 1:\nFirst thing I did was open a new file in the Script editor and ran:\ntell application \"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017\"\n\n    return current document\n\nend tell\n\nSure enough returns a document name as long as a document is open in PS. So no surprises there.\nStep 2.\nTook your script and stripped away all but the essentials and replaced input and output with static values. Well technically the input was just an open document...\nset fileName to \"Filename.tif\"\nset newFilePath to \"/Users/joonaspaakko/Desktop/test/output/\" & fileName\ntell application \"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017\"\n\n    convert to profile \"High Quality Print\" intent absolute colorimetric with dithering\n\n    save current document in file newFilePath as TIFF with options {embed color profile:true, save layers:true, save spot colors:true} appending lowercase extension\n\n    close current document saving no\n\nend tell\n\nStill complains about the document, but I know that is not the issue based on my first test. \nStep 3.\nSo I took a look at the reference document for applescript and in there I looked at the tif save example. Can be found if you search for: save current document in file myFile as TIFF in the pdf.\nI'm not too experienced with Applescript in general let alone scripting Photoshop with it... So I don't know if there are better ways to debug the code, but Script Editor was complaining about that save line and highlighting it, so I figured that is where the error must be... or around that area.\nJust manually looked for differences and possible syntax errors, and I found out it was missing the class:TIFF save options, in the beginning of the tif options object and adding that in fixed the error.\n", "Q: Remove animation/delay on Command+Tab When switching to a full-screen app on a different space there is a noticeable delay (and jerkiness) with the animation during which further presses of ⌘+Tab have no effect. This continues for a fraction of a second even after the animation has finished.\nIt's very annoying and disruptive if keypresses are simply ignored by the OS, and it's beyond me how such an obvious massive flaw goes past quality control at Apple (and how most macOS users seemingly just live with it). \nIs there a way to completely remove the fade (or slide) animation when you switch (⌘+Tab) to a full-screen app that is on a different space?\n\nA: \nGo to System Preferences > Accessibility > Display.

I'm trying to create a load of tables with captions in Mac Word 2011, interspersed with figures, text, ect. With all the insertions, there's a lot of adjusting of where things go. But when I move the tables around, the captions stay put, and I don't see any way to group tables to keep their captions with them. Is there a way to make sure a table and its caption move together in Word 2011?\nJust to be clear, I'm not asking how to make sure they stay together over a page break - I'd like to be able to move the table myself and have the caption come with it.\n\nA: I had a really difficult time with this. The only thing I found that was easy to do and effective was to add another row under the table, merge the columns of that row and format colour, lines accordingly, and then write the text I wanted as though it were a caption. Good luck.\n", "Q: Installing Nikon Capture NX2 on 10.12 Sierra I bought Capture NX2 years ago. I love it for many reasons. Unfortunately, I cannot install it on macOS 10.12 (Sierra). Strangely, I had Capture NX2 on another mac, and it still works after upgrading to Sierra. The new install is the issue. I cannot install it on my new Mac.\nIt seems to me that it does work on Sierra, but is prevented from installing for some reason. I tried the newer version, Capture NXD, but it truly is a downgrade, for many reasons.\nAny idea how to manually transfer the app from my old computer to the new one. I have tried several things, but no luck.\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I had the same issue when I upgraded from Mavericks straight to Sierra. Capture NX2 broke. However, I had earlier installed Capture NX2 on my wife's computer running Yosemite. In desperation I copy pasted the program from her computer to mine and it is now working in Sierra. This was more by luck than design so I cannot guarantee the same results. \nThe process I followed was: \n\n\n*\n\n*Disable SIP (system integrity protection). Please check online how to do this. It can be re-enabled later. This step may or may not be necessary but it was what I followed. \n\n*Uninstall everything Nikon related from Sierra first. Make sure you clean up any Nikon associated files from HD/Library/Application support and HD/Libraries/Preferences in Sierra. This will have to be done manually. \n\n*Then copy paste from a Yosemite computer running Capture NX2 2.4.7. The folders and files I copied were:\n\n\n*\n\n*The NIKON software folder from Applications to Applications on new computer.\n\n*Copy the Nikon folder from /Library/Applications Support (It contains a Nikon sub folder which in turn contains a further six sub folders) to HD/Library/Application Support on the new computer. Subfolders in Nikon folder are listed below: \na Capture NX 2 \nb Common \nc OptionalPictureControl \nd Picture Control Utility \ne Profiles \nf Uninstaller \n\n*Copy all Nikon related files from /Library/Preferences to HD/Library/Preferences on the new computer. These files are listed below:\na Capture NX 2.plist \nb jp.co.nikon.MCA.plist \nc jp.co.nikon.MCA2.plist \nd jp.co.nikon.Nikon Message Center 2.plist \ne jp.co.nikon.UninstallCenter (This one is a folder)\nThats it. I was surprised it worked as it was a last ditch attempt. I had tried all the other methods I could find on the internet without success. I hope this works for you, but as I said earlier this was more by luck than intent. \nI had read online that users who gradually updated their OS incrementally though the various iterations of OS X retained Capture NX2 functionality. Skipping iterations especially after Yosemite was the problem. \nNOTE: It is crucial to have this working on Yosemite before upgrading to later versions of OS X.\n\nA: Yes, I did! Just copying the files from my old computer, as described above, did't work for me... Instead, I found another solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*Installed Mavericks on an external disk.\n\n*Installed CNX2 and VNX2, registered the software and made all updates using the Message_Center_2 app in the installed Nikon folder. \n\n*Mounted the external disk to my new computer running Sierra. \n\n*Archived and deleted all other programs in the Mavericks Program folder. 5. Moved the Zip-Archive file out of the Program folder.\n\n*Used the built-in migration assistant to transfer the program from \"another computer\" (Unchecked all other transfer alternatives).\nNow, only the Nikon folder and it's preferences were transfered, since there were no other programs in the Program folder. \n\n", "Q: Mac OS Sierra Safari Youtube Flash out-of-date I am using Mac OS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73) and Safari 10.1.1 (12603.2.4).\nWhen I visit youtube most videos play fine. but some videos say\nFlash out-of-date\n\nIt also quickly bring up a prompt to say \"upgrade flash\" which leads me to Adobe website.\nBut wasn't flash totally discontinued on Mac and Safari? if so, why am I being asked to upgrade flash?\nI don't want Flash on my machine. \nMy understanding was that Youtube/Safari should use everything as HTML5 (H264) stuff. Then what's going on?\n\nA: Flash is still [barely] alive & kicking, though is not needed at all for YouTube these days.\nThe best way to ensure it's gone once & for all is to use the dedicated uninstaller, available from Adobe, at Adobe KB: Uninstall Flash Player | Mac OS\nThe uninstaller is Mac version-dependant, but the direct link for OS X 10.6 & later is at https://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/support/uninstall_flash_player_osx.dmg\n\nA: Uninstalling per @Tetsujin's answer is the correct course of action if you want Flash gone completely.\nIf you don't want it gone, but don't want most websites to know you have it installed at all, check your Safari preferences, Security tab, Plug-In Settings.\nSelect Adobe Flash Player in the sidebar, then make sure the setting is \"Off\" for everything except websites where you specifically want to use Flash.\nIf you set it to \"Ask\" rather than \"Off\", the website can still tell that you have Flash installed, and may still try to load the Flash version of its video player etc. before Safari can ask you whether you want to use it. This can lead to the \"update Flash\" message that you saw, if your version of Flash is out of date.\n\nA: I found out the answer. it was my own fault. I was trying to install the youtube ad blocker, but by mistake i installed the youtube flash player plugin in safari.\nbecause of that plugin I started getting this warning.\nonce I removed that plugin, the flash warning went away.\n", "Q: Replace HDD with Battery I had serval problems with the SATA cable for the hard disk on my MacBook Pro 13\" mid 2009.\nBuying a new cable from apple was too expensive for that old MacBook, so I kicked out the SuperDrive and put my disk in there.\nNow there is quite a lot empty space in my MacBook and I wonder if it would be possible to put a bigger battery in there.\nConsidering that the old battery is 8 years old and there is more space now it should be possible almost double the battery capacity.\nNow I wonder if there is any way to get such a battery?\n\nA: \nBuying a new cable from apple was too expensive for that old MacBook,\n  so I kicked out the SuperDrive and put my disk in there.\n\nDoing a quick check, this is currently selling for $14 including shipping.  While I'm not against adding a second hard drive, this fix is very much economically feasible to keep your drive in it's default location.\n\nConsidering that the old battery is 8 years old and there is more\n  space now it should be possible almost double the battery capacity.\nNow I wonder if there is any way to get such a battery?\n\nUnless you plan on building your own battery pack, this is simply not an option.

The man page tells us the following about ad-hoc code signing:\n\nIf identity is the single letter \"-\" (dash), ad-hoc signing is performed.  Ad-hoc signing does not use an identity at all, and identifies exactly one instance of code. Significant restrictions apply to the use of ad-hoc signed code; consult documentation before using this.\n\n(Emphasis added by me)\nI wanted to know more and tried to find said documentation, but I was unable to find any details. I have found a technical note called \"macOS Code Signing In Depth\", but it does not mention ad-hoc signing at all.\nWhat are these \"significant restrictions\" and where are they documented?\n\nA: Basically ad-hoc signing in this context means that the binary is signed without any cryptographic proof at all. \nIn essence normally binaries are signed by adding a so-called CMS (a cryptographic message) where the hash of the CodeDirectory is the message that is signed by the signing identity. This means that an outsider can verify that the code was indeed signed by someone holding the private key for that identity.\nWhen running programs, the macOS system can verify that these signatures are valid, and that it trusts the signing identity - and if it does, run the program. This is the basics of the GateKeeper functionality.\nAd-hoc signed binaries are vastly different as they contain no such CMS. Instead it simply holds the SHA-1 hash value of the CodeDirectory without any cryptographic proof of its validity, and no path of certificates/identities to verify against.\nThe CodeDirectory is an object that describes a particular instance of static code by having hash values for various pieces of code that the application is made from. By ensuring that the CodeDirectory is untampered by verifying the cryptographic signature, and that the various code bits of the application match the hash values stored in the directory, you can ascertain that the code wasn't tampered with.\nWithout the cryptographic proof this \"untampered\" check cannot be performed in the normal way.\nInstead ad-hoc signed binaries are checked by comparing the SHA-1 hash value against a list of \"known good\" hash values stored in the static trust cache inside the kernel.\nIn essence this means that the \"significant restrictions\" placed upon any application you ad-hoc sign yourself is that it won't pass any kind of verification anywhere. It basically be the same as a non-signed binary.\nHowever, if you're Apple, you can create applications that aren't codesigned in the ordinary way, and are instead explicitly trusted by the kernel. I.e. if for example Apple wants to ensure that an application is untampered when run at an early stage in system startup where the full signing identity verification is not up and running (or is unavailable) they can use ad-hoc signing. These applications can always be verified by the static trust cache, no matter if your certificate repository is hosed or anything like that.\nIn practice creating ad-hoc signed binaries is only of practical value for Apple developers.\nYou can find minor documentation on ad-hoc signing in Apple's developer section. For example:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seccodesignatureflags/kseccodesignatureadhoc\nBut you can also find snippets of documents in the source code for the codesign utility itself, and in the source code for libsecurity.\n", "Q: iMac WiFi Hotspot not Working I have a late 2009 iMac running 10.12.5 that I am attempting to set up as a wifi hotspot. My current internet connection is DSL (ethernet). \nI finally found a guide online how to actually do this and I follow all the instructions, including setting up a password at the end for security purposes. That went great and both my iPhones (5s and 7) recognized the network. However, when I tried to connect to the network, it said I either needed to restart my modem, router or contact my ISP. I have had this same issue previously when I have tried to make my iMac a hotspot (I had a computer exactly like this one before and had the same issue with it, the other one was running El Capitan though).\nMy question here is, what am I missing? Why isn't my iMac becoming a hotspot after I have gone through the set up process? Here is the link I used for the instructions to set the hotspot up. \n\nA: *\n\n*You might have been sharing your connection from a wrong connection. For example, if you are connected via ethernet, and share it over wifi, you have to select the right ethernet port (some computers have more than one with USB or thunderbolt adapters).\n\n*Your network has some type of VPN set up, it prevents sharing. OR your ISP simply deployed hotspot request filtering technology. You either have to turn it off, hack it if you know how (looks like you don't), or just move on and not share your connection.\n\n*You hardware is broken. Nothing you can do there.\n\n*You encounter kext error. Need a full power down and restart.\n", "Q: How do i disable Fn Key on Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard for OS X? I recently acquired a MS Surface Ergonomic Keyboard. Its a great device for everything other than a Fn lock key that is awkwardly placed between the CTRL and OPTION/WINDOWS key. \nI've looked at the keyboard viewer to see what input is being communicated so i might try and override it in Karibener Elements - but the Keyboard Viewer is not showing any key inputs.\nHow do i find what key is being triggered and disable it? \nNote: The 'Fn' key is stateful like a caps lock key. \n\n\nA: It seems like the keyboard handles the Fn key itself, rather than passing it through to the OS to handle. Since the OS doesn't receive the Fn key input, it can't do anything to change it.\nTherefore, disabling the Fn key would have to be something the keyboard would allow you to control, either on the keyboard itself or with a tool which writes that information back. I can't find either of these, so I don't think it's possible currently.\n", "Q: Carrier SIM card and unlocking issues... I recently purchased a used iPhone 7 to upgrade from a 5s. The new iPhone was on AT&T and I use Verizon, so I knew it needed to be unlocked before I attempted to use my current SIM card in it. \nI also wasn't sure what the process would be for switching a SIM between phones (smart phones are a rather new territory for me, the 5s being my first), so I took both phones into the Verizon store, and asked what needed to be done. I was told that as long as the phone was unlocked, all that would need to be done would be switching the SIM card. The 7 had just been paid off in the AT&T store minutes before I took it to Verizon, so the information had apparently not yet been sent to it to unlock. Therefore, when the Verizon SIM was put in, it gave the SIM Not Supported error. \nWhile the person at the Verizon store had the AT&T SIM out, he asked if I still needed it. I naively said no. So, that being said, I now have an iPhone 5s that still works on Verizon and an iPhone 7 that, more than likely would be carrier unlocked if it still had its AT&T SIM card; which is my problem...\nHow do I go about getting my 7 unlocked now that it doesn't have the rather important AT&T SIM in it? The friend that I purchased the 7 from did send AT&T an unlock request last week and hasn't heard back from them yet. \nTo recap... I have an iPhone 7 that probably would be carrier unlocked; however, due to a naive action by me, it is not... What do I do now? \n\nA: Unlocking an AT&T iPhone requires more than just AT&T to send the unlock command. \nIf they have granted the unlock request, they should have sent you an email telling you what to do:\nBack up your phone to your Mac or PC. Then wipe and reset it (settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content And Settings) and then restore from that backup.\nYou should turn off find my iPhone first.\nOnce it has erased go through the setup procedure it will ask you how you want to set it up. Select the option to restore from an iTunes backup. Plug it into the computer you just backed it up to and restore the phone.\nYou are now unlocked.\n", "Q: What format does the apple notes sqlite db date use? I want to extract the note texts and modification dates from an sqlite notes database extracted from an iOS device backup. But I can't figure out how to convert the date format to a readable date string.\nHow I got the data\nI found out which file had the note data from this page.\nRelevant portion:\nStep 1. Find the Backup File in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/fea….627\n        something like : ca3b….39c\n       If you have trouble seeing Library folder \n       defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles Yes\nStep 2. Copy file and rename as notes.sqlite \n\nWhat I've tried so far\nI've opened the file up and confirmed it has the expected note body text inside it. The body text is inside a table called ZNOTEBODY. Another table called ZNOTE has a a ZBODYcolumn which appears to contain indices into the ZNOTEBODY table, and a ZMODIFICATIONDATE column. Here is the crux of the matter: The ZMODIFICATIONDATE column has a listed type of TIMESTAMP and it contains floating point numbers. \nI looked at the sqlite docs and found this:\n\nSQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times. Instead, the built-in Date And Time Functions of SQLite are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*TEXT as ISO8601 strings (\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS\"). \n  \n*REAL as Julian day numbers, the number of days since noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar. \n  \n*INTEGER as Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.\n  \n  \n  Applications can chose to store dates and times in any of these formats and freely convert between formats using the built-in date and time functions.\n\nSo I tried using the built-in datetime function with a simple SELECT datetime(ZMODIFICATIONDATE) FROM ZNOTE; but that produced nonsense values like 1171380-13689427-18 21:08:40 for an entry I know corresponds to 2014-08-12. The stored value in question was 429559087.38102.\nSo, does anyone know what format is being used here?

I've been writing a script for my Mac Mini (2014) that does a speed test and logs the data to a database. All that works great, but the results were a lot lower than I was expecting.\nI have a gigabit connection and my Mac Mini is hardwired directly to my Airport Extreme. I was expecting to see something around 900 Mbps, but it was more like 500 Mbps. I would usually blame my ISP at this point, but I decided to run the test from my Macbook Pro as well. My laptop was spitting out in the upper 900s consistently. My setup between my Mac Mini and my Macbook Pro are identical, both hardwired (with the same cable) to my Airport Extreme.\nI looked up the specs for my Mac Mini and it says that it's 10/100/1000BASE-T\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/sp710?locale=en_US\nI'm confused, why am I getting such drastically different results?\n\nA: Mac minis ship with 5400 RPM spinning hard drives. Even if you’re using a Fusion Drive configuration, its solid state portion is likely taken up by more-frequently accessed files.\nSo assuming your downloaded data gets written to some temporary file, your benchmark is running off the mechanical drive. Add to that the overhead of recording logs to a separate database, which will further decrease your storage performance.\nOn the other hand, Apple laptops all ship with SSDs. An SSD should easily keep up with a Gbps connection.\nThe most probable scenario is your Mac mini is being bottlenecked by its hard drive.\n\nA: I've been suffering from this for a while now. I use my late 2014 mini regularly and replaced the ol' HDD with SSD which made it very well usable with 8G and Mojave. Enough to rule out I/O as a bottleneck. \nI noticed it still gets around 350Mb/sec on speedtest.net (and derivatives) when my MBP can pull 850Mb/sec+ with the same tests. \nWhat helped was to enable Jumbo Frames (from 1500 to 9000) in System Preferences → Network → Ethernet → Advanced… → Hardware. That immediately bumped it up from ~350Mb/sec to ~720Mb/sec. \nYes all my backbone supports jumbo frames. \nSo for me, SSD (for overall speed and usability) and Jumbo Frames (for network speeds) did the trick.\n", "Q: Can you have symlinks across various backup disks/ volumes? Is it possible to have two backup disks, which, when connected to the same machine, can have directories symlinked to each other? I'm working on this triple redundant backup scheme in which not all data is replicated across all three disks, but when working in a given disk, I would still like to have access to files and scripts on another remote disk.\n\nA: Yes, symlinks can be pointed anywhere. They’ll only function correctly when the destination is mounted, but that’s to be expected.\nSomething which might not be expected is if for some reason the path doesn’t match. The most likely reason would be if an incorrect mount occurred previously or two partitions have the same name, causing one partition to mount as /Volumes/Name (1), which won’t match what your symlink is looking for. If something doesn’t seem right, check everything is in order in your /Volumes folder.\n", "Q: Thunderbird stopped working with iCloud email I had Thunderbird configured with an iCloud (me) email account and it worked fine until about two weeks ago.

I was able to add and use a Gmail account without any problems.\nMy setting are:\nIncoming\nProtocol: IMAP\nServer: imap.mail.me.com\nPort: 993\nSSL: SSL/TLS\nAuthentication: Normal password\n\nOutgoing\nProtocol: SMTP\nServer: smtp.mail.me.com\nPort: 587\nSSL: STARTTLS\nAuthentication: Normal password\n\nI got the settings from How can I configure iCloud mail in Mozilla Thunderbird?\nI am able to login to both iCloud accounts through a browser.\n\nA: Starting June 15, 2017, Apple requires two-factor authentication on all iCloud accounts that access their accounts non-natively. Apple’s third-party email client setup instructions have since been updated accordingly.\nNative iCloud access is limited to System Preferences on macOS, the Settings app on iOS, and iCloud for Windows. All other apps, including Thunderbird and Outlook, require an app-specific password.\nTo enable two-factor authentication:\n\n\n*\n\n*On an iOS device open Settings → Password & Security and tap Turn On Two-Factor Authentication.\n\n*On your Mac open  → System Preferences → iCloud → Account Details → Security and click Turn On Two-Factor Authentication….\n\n\nThen, login at https://id.apple.com/ and under Security → App-Specific Passwords, click Generate Password…. Enter that password into Thunderbird.\nThis was done to keep third-party apps from getting access to your iCloud password, thus reducing the likelihood of iCloud account breaches.\n", "Q: How can iOS 11’s screen recording not record the control center screen? We can start the screen recorder in the control center but this part also goes into the recording. How can we skip this part?\n\nA: EDIT: As of the GM release, a 3 second timer has been implemented allowing time to dismiss Control Center.   The end of the clip may still require editing, however. \nDisclaimer: As of this posting, iOS 11 is in Public Beta and may change before final release.\nAs of writing, it does not appear that a 'timer' can be set to indicate when to start the recording.\nThe recording does indeed start when the button on the control center is tapped.  This can be edited out of the final recording by trimming the video.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the video in the Photos app.\n\n*Use the yellow handles (indicated by the <> symbols) to trim the beginning and end of the video as desired.\n\n\n\n", "Q: iPhone how to disable sound notifications at work Let's say you are at the office 9-5, can you schedule the phone to be muted (mostly messaging, FB) during these hours and / or this location.\n\nA: This can be done by scheduling Do Not Disturb.\nGo into Settings → Do Not Disturb and enable Scheduled from 9 a.m. To 5 p.m.\nUnder Allow Calls From you may allow certain people to call you even while Do Not Disturb is active. Calls silenced by Do Not Disturb will go directly to voicemail.\nAt your discretion, you may also choose to Always silence notifications, or Only while iPhone is locked.\nEmergency and Amber Alerts will still blare through Do Not Disturb. Those may only be silenced by toggling the hardware Mute switch, or by disabling them at the bottom of the Notifications menu.\n", "Q: After installing iOS 11 public beta, then deleting profile, will I receive the official release of iOS 10.3.3? I'm currently using an iPhone 5S.\nI installed the iOS 11 Public Beta a few days ago, and found that downgrading would risk my phone being stuck in recovery/DFU mode. I was wondering, if I deleted the profile (which would opt me out of receiving beta updates), would I get the update for the official release of iOS 10.3.3? And would I be able to install it, even when my phone is running on iOS 11?\n\nA: No, you won't get an update to iOS 10.3.3, as this would amount to downgrading (not updating) your iOS, which isn't possible at all (except by restoring the iPhone from an old backup).\n", "Q: Wondering if there's a way to get rid of an error in Apple Script to mount server I was wondering if anyone could help me with this. Sorry for the noob question. I recently created a script to automatically mount a Time Machine image in a hard drive connected to my router. For the most part, the script works great. It attaches the drive when I turn on the computer and, if it disconnects for any reason, it reconnects and mounts the image again. Here's the script:\non idle\nset mySSID to do shell script \"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | awk '/ SSID/ {print substr($0, index($0, $2))}'\"\nset mountedDiskName to \"Time Machine\"\nset diskIsMounted to false\nif mySSID is \"TALKTALK844E28\" or mySSID is \"TALKTALK844E285G\" then\n    tell application \"System Events\" to set diskNames to name of every disk\n    if mountedDiskName is in diskNames then\n        set diskIsMounted to true\n    end if\n    if mountedDiskName is not in diskNames then\n        set diskIsMounted to false\n    end if\n    if diskIsMounted is false then\n        mount volume \"smb://192.168.1.1/\"\n        delay 30\n        do shell script \"hdiutil attach -mountpoint '/Volumes/Time Machine' /Volumes/Guille/TimeMachine.sparsebundle\"\n    end if\n    if diskIsMounted is true then\n    end if\nend if\nreturn 300\nend idle\n\nHowever, every once in a while, I get this error:\n\nIt doesn't really bother me because if I just click on OK it goes away and tries again 5 minutes later. However, I would like to know if there's a way to make sure these dialogs are automatically dismissed so they don't interrupt my workflow and Time Machine stays unobtrusively in the background until I accidentally send something to the trash :-)\n\nA: I'm really only a beginner to scripting, but I'm wondering why you have so much code in your script.  I was able to accomplish the exact same results with using only a couple of commands.  \nmount volume \"smb://192.168.2.66/\"\ndo shell script \"hdiutil attach -noverify '/Volumes/Data_Smokestack_ATC/James’s MacBook Pro.sparsebundle'\"\n\nI have both of my Airport Time Capsules set with static IPv4 addresses, so their IP’s never change (so I always know how to connect to them if I need to)\nThe do shell script part of my code waits until the mount volume command completes, therefore, I did not need to insert a delay command. On my system using the latest version of macOS Sierra,  if I run this code again while the volume is already mounted, this script just quietly completes with no errors or messages.  \nThat said, my thought is wouldn't it just be more “code efficient” to run these two lines of code inside of a repeat loop at 15 minute intervals for 12 or 24 hours or something like that? Then to be saved as a stay open application?\n", "Q: Is there a way to merge windows of the same application without a \"Merge All Windows\" menu item? Some macOS applications (e.g. Finder or Terminal, but also third-party apps like SourceTree) have a Windows > Merge All Windows menu item that allows to merge all application windows into a single, tabbed application window.\nIf an application does not provide this menu item, is there a way to merge this application's windows into a single one? One example is the Atom text editor - I'd love to be able to merge the various editor windows into a single one from time to time, e.g. when just working on the laptop without an external monitor connected.\nThis is on macOS Sierra.\n\nA: It's up to the developer to support this functionality. Many apps (document based etc. written using native Cocoa classes) support this by default. \nThere's not much you can do to enable this in apps which do not implement it.\n\nA: If an application supports tabbed mode, but doesn't have such setting in menu, try to execure the following command in Terminal:\ndefaults write -app <App Name> AppleWindowTabbingMode -string \"always\"\n\nThen restart the application.\nFor example, following command helps SourceTree to persistently switch to tabbed mode:\ndefaults write -app SourceTree AppleWindowTabbingMode -string \"always\"\n\n", "Q: How do I access special characters on Apple's Smart Keyboard? I bought the new iPad Pro 10.5\" and with it the Apple Smart Keyboard with the US Layout. Now I am constantly switching between writing in german, english and some french.\nTherefore I would like to access special characters like in macOS or in iOS:\n\n\nSo how can I access the special character menu via the Apple Smart\n  Keyboard?\n\n\nA: You should be able to use the standard Apple option key shortcuts, such as ⌥ + e, then e produces é.  One list is here.\nFor the german \"Umlaut\", it is:\n⌥ + u (for Umlaut) and then the letter (like a, u or o)\nSo:\n ⌥ + u and then a produces “ä” \n\nA: If you are not using the US layout as in the original question, the keyboard shortcuts for making accents may be different.  For example, on the Apple Spanish ISO layout, the keys to the right of P and Ñ have the grave, circumflex, umlaut, and acute diacritics. For the tilde on letters other N,  you use Option Ñ.  You type the diacritics first and then the base letter.  They have an orange border in the image below to indicate they are dead keys for those accents.\n\n", "Q: How do I transfer mp3 files from my Lumia 730 to MacBook Pro? I have read about Windows Phone App for Mac but sadly it is not available from the store in India? Is there any alternative software? Will using a VPN help?\n\nA: Okay so I did a simple transfer from my SD card, inserting it in my mac! If anyone has a more elegant solution, do share! \n", "Q: App store to forget programs on Iphone 6s Over the past few years, I have downloaded various apps onto my iPhone from the App Store. I have noticed that the App Store remembers the apps that I have downloaded. So, for instance: If I download an app and then delete it from my phone and go back into the App Store, the download icon is different (it doesn't say \"+Get\" like apps that I have never downloaded before, instead it will have an icon of a cloud with an arrow pointing downwards).\nHow to I get the App Store to forget these programs?\n\nA: It's not entirely clear what you mean by \"forget these programs\", but you can choose to hide them.\nTo hide apps you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the App Store app\n\n*Tap on Updates > Purchased > My Purchases\n\n*Find the app that you want to hide\n\n*Swipe left on the app\n\n*Tap Hide\n\nA: You can't.  All apps associated with an Apple ID will be displayed.\nThe only reason (that I'm aware) that an app will not be displayed is if the app is no longer for sale in the store (the developer discontinued the app, for example).\nIf you don't want to see these apps, you'll need to create a new Apple ID.  This might be more trouble than it's worth, however.  Switching to a new Apple ID will affect everything associated with that ID such as iCloud, Game Center, past in-app purchases, etc.  I'm not talking about just changing your email address, I'm referring to moving to a brand new Apple ID.  \nIf you decide this path is worth it for you, just sign-out of every service and device on the old ID and create a new Apple ID.  Then sign-in with that new ID on all your devices and services.  \n", "Q: PDF Reader for MacOS with font size cutomization Very often the font size in pdf files is too small. To read the document one has to continuously scroll and zoom the document, which I find really annoying, especially when several windows are opened. On the other hand in ebook readers (e.g. Kindle) there is the possibility to change the font size of a pdf file. \nDo you know whether there is any pdf reader software for macOS that has this feature?\n\nA: Anyhow I found that using preview and the combination of commands cmd+ctrl+f the screen goes to two pages and it can be zoomed. This is comfortable enough for reading!\n\nA: I don't know of any app that will adjust just the font size. Adobe Acrobat Reader has multiple zoom settings which once set will stay at that level till changed. I often use this feature with settings like 125% or 150%. These setting are numerical in value instead on the common 'Zoom In' or 'Zoom Out' so its easy to reproduce. I think to change font size only one would have to convert PDF to a text document, adjust the font, and convert back to PDF. Not a cheap option but Acrobat Reader can do this for a price.\n\nA: Yeah I don't think PDF works that way. While you can have text in a PDF, along with it you'll have the font & placement on the page. If you want to alter the representation on the page you really should do it in an editor not a viewer, where text & metadata are handled separately instead of being bound together. \n", "Q: How difficult is it to replace the keys on the Apple Wireless Keyboard? I wish the plastic Apple uses for keys was as good as the electronics and the cases. I had vowed never to buy Logitech keyboards and mice because their electronics are fine, but their plastic cases are so poorly engineered those devices collapse within a year. By comparison, one can get many years of an Apple keyboard. The aluminum cases are solid.\nI understand that, officially, only the keys on MacBooks can be replaced. The keys on the old (Apple Wireless Keyboard) and those on the new (Magic Keyboard) cannot be replaced. Officially.\n\nThe keys, as you see, are now rather grating to use, and the notches gradually disappear, making it harder to touch-type. I see individual keys offered on eBay. They seem to be salvaged, not new.\nIf Apple declines to change them officially, how much skill is needed to replace such a key by the end user? Is the plastic underneath particularly breakable?\nUpdate\nOK, I see that ifixit says: \"Keys can be easily [italics added] removed by using a scalpel or fingernail under the left side and lifted.\"\nIs this \"easy\" by ifixit's standard only? Have you succeeded in replacing several such keys without getting one broken? (which would render the entire device useless).\n\nA: That older model has key caps that are far easier to fix than the new low profile keyboards. \nThey are still not easy and by the time the keys wear out, the plastic scissors are likely equally worn or fragile. You’ll probably want half a dozen “donor” keyboards for parts if you decide to DIY repair these era of keyboards. But with a skilled technician, what you ask is doable without special tools and large stockpile of 100% new parts. \n", "Q: What iOS VNC client has the least lag? I've downloaded VNC Viewer on my iPad. I have noticed that it takes about 10 seconds for the iPad screen to update, in order to reflect the current Macbook screen. This is on the lowest quality setting in VNC Viewer.\nI understand that the update speed is a function of the speed of my internet connection. Both the Macbook and the iPad are connected to the internet via WiFi.\nHowever, is there an iOS app that updates faster? In other words, is there an app that offers a lower picture quality? I am comfortable with losing picture quality in exchange for less lag.\nI do not need the ability to control or manipulate the Mac. I just need the ability to view the Mac's screen. The picture quality does not have to be particularly clear.\n\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \niOS 10.3.2 \n\n\nA: Have a look at: NoMachine (Main Web Site link.)\nYou can download the macOS version from there.\nFor iOS 5.1.1 or later. Compatible with iPad: iTunes Preview of NoMachine\nI haven't used it between my Mac and iDevice, but do use it between my Mac and Linux Media Server. It's free and it works great for my needs.\n", "Q: macOS native VPN can't cifs:// into file server on another network I have configured the macOS' native VPN to connect from location (a) to location (b), and now I would like to access the Thecus file storage server I have at location (b).\nAccordingly, pressing cmdK in Finder and typing: cifs://192.168.x.x <-- server IP here.\nto access the server I cannot connect, it just keeps trying to connect. Connecting from home it works, just not from one office to the other.\nHow can I get this to work? I have even tried afp://\nBoth endpoints are Mac devices if that helps. \nInterestingly, both locations are on the same sub-net (192.168.X).\nIs there a way to overcome this? I have a feeling that I may have to change the subnet of one of the offices. \n\nA: Use smb:// for file shares and vnc:// for screen shares. I’ve not had good success with cifs:// and Finder. \nIf smb fails, check for open ports using network utility and look at the console on Mac and error log on the server/Linux/pc side. Network utility will show you if you have an ip / network conflict. The vpn possibly can’t route any traffic correctly if both non-routable networks conflict. Either the local or remote will have to change NAT range or move to IPv6. \n", "Q: Highlight parts of a 2D Line Chart in Numbers I'm using the latest version of Numbers (4.2) and am looking to plot a Line Graph, with a few sections highlighted in a color as shown:\n\nAny leads on how to do the same?\n\nA: Ah! Nevermind! I managed a workaround. Since I found no solution online I'll answer myself here in case it helps anyone.\nUnder Chart's Background & Border Style, select \"Advanced Gradient Fill\" as shown in Image 1\nThen change the Gradient angle to 180˚. If you hover just below the  Gradient Slider, you should see a + symbol. Use that to add more stops.\nIn the example below, I have 8 stops. (4 for each highlight zone). Each highlight zone would need 4 stops (in this order): \nWhite (Chart Background Color), Red (Highlight Color), Red (Highlight Color), and White (Chart Background Color). \n\nThey are almost overlapping in pairs, and hence you can't see all 8 here.

I have a mid-2010 MacPro Tower. Bays are full, including 2nd optical drive slot.\nI've seen PCIe cards that will hold 4 M.2 SSD blades, but the specs listed don't list MacOS as supported, although in some cases, a comment from a buyer says it works in a Mac.\nIs there a way to tell if a given card will work? Item shows \"Chipset: Marvell 88SE9230 support HyoperDuo\" in case this makes a difference. \n\nA: There is no comprehensive and easy place to check. Whatever pci card you place in will get power and send data to the rest of the system, but each OS has different drivers included. \nThe safest bet is for the card vendor to list or provide drivers or compatibility notices for you to know if it works natively without adding a driver on some or all versions of macOS / OS X. \nThat being said, storage is one of the safer bets since the API/interfaces there are stable for quite some time and PCI is not bleeding edge or likely to be something the vendor didn’t anticipate. \nThe next safe bet is to buy from a vendor that has clear sales and return policies or can support you before you buy. This usually means paying for that service (or them charging a slightly higher price across the board) since the vendors with the lowest price can just list things and not care if you get what you need since they have to pay someone to know and test things or at least follow up on returns and learn by trial and error what works and what gets returned. \n", "Q: Today & Tomorrow Summaries re-add to Notifications on reboot.

I am experiencing a potential known issue of second monitor not waking when system wakes from sleep.  I have done the perquisite resets of SMC and NVRAM and have been working with Apple support to a very deep level.  To no avail.  There seems to be an issue where system does not respond as expected when there are multiple power sources.  Is there a way to disable the power flow from the LG Ultrafine 4k monitors?  I will just rely on the wall.  I have a 2017 15\" MBPro with Radeon Pro 560.  I have tested on MacOS 10.12.5 and MacOS 10.13 Beta (17A291m). Thanks!\n\nA: Please disregard. the issue that led to this odd question has been resolved with an recent LG firmware update.\nI have two UltraFine 4K monitors connected to a 2016 MBPro. When the Mac went to sleep both displays went to sleep, but only one would wake.\nThis has been resolved by the latest firmware.\n1.) InstaLL LG Screen Manager.

This makes editing text go from intolerable to doable.\nI just got a new iPad Pro.  The same feature does not work.  Presumably because of a lack of force touch?  Well, this makes text editing totally unbearable.  Is there a way to control the cursor in a similar way on iPad?\n\nA: Place two fingers on the keyboard and drag the two fingers around to move the cursor.\nOn iPhone, you don't hold a specific key — the action is initiated with 3D Touch anywhere on the keyboard with one finger. As you mentioned, iPad does not currently have 3D Touch, but you can use two fingers to manipulate the cursor like you did on your iPhone with one finger. The iPhone functionality came after the iPad keyboard cursor trackpad was implemented.\n", "Q: Improvements of the iPhone 6 over the iPhone 5s All, \nI have (at work) the choice between a: \n\n\n*\n\n*16 GB iPhone 6 (A1586) \n\n*32 GB iPhone 5S (A1457)\n\n\nI'm concerned about the smaller capacity of the newer phone.

Most notably the CPU in the 5s is the A7 and the 6 contains the A8.  Each generation of processor brings a jump in raw power. from A7 to A8 25% inc in processing and 50% increase in graphics with a 50% Reduction in power consumption due to new manufacturing process.  Each version of the iPhone typically come with better battery life.  However, If these are used then the life of the battery will depend on past treatment.  An iPhone battery will only respond to finite recharges and life diminishes over time and use.\nAdditionally the camera will always have improvements.  A great read on many iPhone cameras can be found at http://snapsnapsnap.photos/how-does-the-iphone-6-camera-compare-to-previous-iphone-cameras/\nMotion sensor capability is about the same.\nFinally, both phones will be supported by iOS 11.\n", "Q: How do I delete all Podcasts at once in iTunes I'd like to know how I can delete all podcasts (via command line) or something, because unsubscribing from 90+ podcasts takes too long.\n\nA: In iTunes, go to the Podcasts library (View > Media Kind > Podcasts) and view as Classic List (View > View As > Classic List).\nYour list of podcasts should then appear in the main window. Select All (Edit > Select All). Click on the 'Unsubscribe' button in the bottom right corner.\nThis doesn't delete the files, it unsubscribes you so that you stop getting updates and new files.

I've got a problem that's been bugging me for a long time: the keyboard keys don't map across correctly from the host to the guest. I've got the UK, Macintosh layout set in the guests, and the keyboard map shows the correct layout. But, as an example, when I need to type ~, I actually have to type ±, etc. Yet the @ and \" keys map correctly.\nI've read lots of advice about using the Keyboard and Mouse settings in VMWare Fusion to map the keys correctly, but as far as I can tell, these options only relate to shortcuts (am I missing something)?\nAlso, given that Fusion is designed for the Mac, how is it that it can't detect my MBP's keyboard layout and correctly map that to a Mac layout? Is it just me, or is that crazy?\n\nA: I've been running a Linux guest on my iMac VMware Fusion Hypervisor for years and have been logging in via ssh to avoid this.

The full backup is on a partition of an external hard drive and there is a folder called _CCC_Archives which I believe stores the diffs over time. \nI have upgraded the OS at least once and I'm wondering what the implications of this are.\nSince upgrading from something like Snow Leopard to Sierra some of my music projects fail to open, presumably due to incompatible software. Is there some way to boot my MacBook using a backup from an older OS, capture and export some files, then reboot the MacBook to the newer OS that I'm running?\nNote that I have never backed up the Mac since upgrading the OS because I did not want to corrupt my backup if it would in fact be irreversibly corrupted by this change. So the backup drive only includes backups using Snow Leopard.\nThe setting I use for backups in CCC is called:\n\"Maintain a backup (Archive modified and deleted files)\"\nAnd below this I see:\n• Files and folders on \"My Passport\" that are not present on \"Macintosh HD\" will be archived.\n• Previously backed up files on \"My Passport\" will be updated only if the size or modification date differs.\n• Older versions of updated files will be archived.\n• CCC will not prune archive content.\n\nA: Based on the info in your question you should be able to restore an appropriate backup image to another external drive. \nOnce you've done this, boot your Mac into the Startup Disk Manager (i.e. press and hold the option key as you boot up) until you see the drive options appear. Select the disk you've just restored the Snow Leopard backup to and press enter to see if you can boot from it.\nIf it boots okay, then you can try to convert the files you want to use in macOS Sierra.\nNOTES:\n1 If your drive doesn't appear in the Startup Disk Manager, there are a number of possible reasons for this. If this happens to you, then while you're in the Startup Disk Manager you can try pressing the option+shift+command+. keys to see if your external drive has optional ROM firmware available.\n2 If you can't boot up from the drive, refer to the Help! My clone won't boot! page for a detailed list of possible causes/solutions.\n", "Q: macOS/iOS devices reconnect automatically to airplay/bluetooth device disturbing intended audio stream I have a wireless airplay/bluetooth speaker and a number of macOS and iOS devices. I am facing one issue that drives me crazy. \nLet's say I watch a movie from one MacBook using AirPlay to connect to the speaker. After few minutes some of the other devices connects i.e. to play notification (usually I cannot even hear it) and the intended audio stream stops being played - I need to switch back and forth to other device to revert original audio stream being played on the speaker.\nIt would be insane to disconnect all the other devices from this device each time. Also the reality is that due to i.e. pure network or device being suspended for some time it will reconnect again disturbing the intended video stream all over again. And since most of the devices are also paired to same device via bluetooth (to be able to use it while being out of WiFi coverage) the problem is actually doubled.\nIdeally I would see one of either being able to disable autoconnect to wireless speaker or being able to detect the device is already in use and prevent to connect only then. One more could be that maybe the loudspeaker device is not just broadcasting its presence but also if it's ready to accept default/spontaneous  connection - not sure if there is such thing in the protocol.\nUpdate: There is a kind of workaround for a bluetooth (less important) part of the question which disables auto reconnect to any audio device \nPrevent auto-pairing for certain devices (Bluetooth) by:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist DontPageAudioDevices 1\n\n\nA: It may sound like a simple solution, and it may not be what you're looking for, but it is the easiest to accomplish: turn off Bluetooth on the devices you don't want to connect.\nPersonally, I don't like leaving BT on and running on my devices when it is not in use. A quick swipe on the Control Center and the On/Off toggle is right there.\n\nA: It appears to be a known issue.

I need to update the OS. The device is telling me there's an update for 9.3, but I'm getting an error saying unable to verify the update because I'm no longer connected to the internet.\nBefore you even suggest it, I did all these things mentioned here (and everywhere else): https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7506344?tstart=0. Is this iPad in un-update-able hell? Is there some way I can manually update it to a lower version than 9 as a stepping stone?\n\nA: Welp, I resolved this problem, or rather, iTunes decided to resolve this problem for me after some hesitation; it finally prompted me to update the device (after telling me it wasn't supported -_-). So if you're in my boat and exhausted all of those \"turn it off and back on\"-esque options, hopefully fidgeting with iTunes grants you the opportunity to update.\n", "Q: Why does iTunes Connect say that the day isn't over yet in all regions when it is? I'm trying to look up Sales and Trends data for yesterday in iTunes Connect, but it says that the day isn't over yet in all regions:\n\nBut it is:\n\nIs it just a lag in reflecting data in iTunes Connect, or are today's clicks being attributed to yesterday? :(\n\nA: No, this is not due to a lag or bug. The fact is that as I write this, it is still 30 June 2017 in some regions. \nFor example, right now it is 10:27pm Friday night in New York.\n[EDIT]\nYou may find it useful to refer to one of the many online time services, such as the World Clock to check what the time is at any given moment around thew world.\n\nA: There is a place, the uninhabited wildlife refuges of Howland & Baker Islands in the Pacific Ocean, territorial areas of the United States, that is in a timezone, IDLW (International Date Line West), that is 12 hours behind UTC, UTC-12:00, designated Etc/GMT+12 in the IANA time zone database.\nThough not official, it is commonly designated as AoE, for Anywhere on Earth. So called because it is the last place on earth where any date can exist. For that reason it is not uncommon for notices or contracts that involve multiple timezones to use the AoE timezone as the deadline. For example this question on Academia Stack Exchange.\nAt the time pictured in your question, 1:40 AM UTC, Saturday, 1 July 2017 (2017-07-01 01:40 UTC), the time AoE would be 1:40 PM AoE, Friday, 30 June 2017 (2017-06-30 13:40 AoE). That means, at the time of that screenshot, you still had 10 hours and 20 minutes until the day is over \"in all regions.\" As of the posting of this answer, it will still be almost 6 hours until the day is over in all regions, and iTunes Connect will update their final numbers.\nI have not found a way to use that timezone in the Google Calendar app, so you can't set a reminder specifically to that time without doing some adjustments of your own. You can, however, monitor the AoE time on the web. For example at the TimeAndDate website, the Time.is website, or the WorldTimeServer website. \n", "Q: Using python 3 when the default is python 2.7 I installed python3 with homebrew and can access it with python3 command in terminal.\nI'm installing a command line app that needs python3.

The upper case of my (5,2) Macbook has stopped working so I'm not able to use the power button to turn it on. I'm currently using an external keyboard/mouse. Here's the problem- In order to tun it on, I have to short the power pads on the logic board which I think is pretty risky if not done properly. I wanna avoid the risk of making the mistake and frying the logic board.\nunder system preferences -> energy saver -> power adapter, I found \"restart immediately after a power failure\"\nSo if there is a \"power failure', I should theoretically be able to turn the mac on the next time I plug in the magsafe adapter, right?\nBut what counts as a power failure? Is just taking the battery out while the magsafe adapter is still attached considered a power failure?\n\nA: This is similar to functions found in the bios of PC's as described here. I don't believe that functions is supposed to be available on portables, but evidently it is for you.\nWhat explicitly counts as a power failure is loss of power to the motherboard. So that means the battery would have to be removed while the MagSafe is not connected. If the MagSafe is connected, it would not count as a power failure. \nThe computer starts up again if the power was cut to it (Last State). So if you yank the power at the log in screen, it'll power back on however if you yank the power after shutdown, it'll stay shut down. \n\nA: You are correct that those pads will be permanently damaged and you will wreck the substrate or electrostatically ruin the hardware in time. If you can write off this Mac and replace it soon I would rig up a better switch. \nSince you’re uncomfortable shorting the pins, I would solder a connector of your choosing to the pins and have a physical switch wired. A micro push switch might also fit somewhere inside. \nThe power restart on a “detected power loss” has never been reliably solid in my experience for battery powered devices. Sometimes it triggers, sometimes not and mostly when you are counting on it it fails - perhaps the SMC is designed for line powered events on iMac and mini and pro line. \nThe other option would be a flat rate depot repair for $300 or so. As long as no clearly unauthorized repairs have been done (or poorly done and undocumented official repairs) Apple fixes everything wrong for the flat rate or explains why the flat rate doesn’t apply. You get a 90 day warranty and hopefully several years of life for far less than a new Mac. \n", "Q: mail client for Mac with these characteristics? I'm looking for an email client for Mac, with these characteristics: \nMust have: \n\n\n*\n\n*One that doesn't automatically mark messages as read.

For instance, one could have the r key mark messages as read by putting the following in one's keymap.json:\n{\n    \"core:mark-as-read\": \"r\"\n}\n\n\n*Nylas supports a dual-pane mode (similar to Apple Mail), allowing one to preview a message without having to open it in a separate window.\nUnfortunately, while Nylas does have built-in spell-check, it does not use Apple's native solution.\nNylas also boasts a host of other features, including read receipts, link tracking, message snoozing, and templated quick replies. There is a Pro version, but all of these features are in the free version (which I use).\nFor the record, I am not affiliated in any way with Nylas—I just like their mail client.\n", "Q: Would it be security risk to not upgrade to Sierra? Due to not getting Sierra upgrade work, I'm using El Capitan.\nCould this pose security risk due to El Capitan already too old to get updates?\n\nA: El Capitan is still currently supported by Apple.

I bought an iPad lately (10.5\" 2017), and I want to connect it via HDMI to my HDTV. Now I know that because of the iPad screen size, I cannot get fullscreen on my TV (I have black borders right and left right now).\nBut, is there any way I can make it work?\nI use this iPad for travelling and would love to plug it into a hotel TV and watch Netflix on it. But I would like to display the content fullscreen without the black borders!\n\nA: There are apps that detect if your iPad is mirrored to an external device via HDMI and adjust to fit accordingly.  For example, the official Netflix app outputs the original aspect ratio to the external screen.  The device displays the message \"Now playing on your TV\" as noted in the attached screen shot.  The TV displays the show at the proper aspect ratio depending on its settings.\nKeynote and other apps work similarly.  It would depend largely on the aspect ratio of the TV show or Movie being played.\n\n\nA: After some discussion with the Netflix chat support I got this confirmed. It has now been reported to the development team and hopefully they will improve the iOS app in the future so that downloads too will use the \"now playing on TV\" feature for full frame width on a TV with iPAD (4:3) as the source.\n\nA: As someone has stated, it's really a developer issue. The best solution I've found is using the zoom function on the television, if it has one. My girlfriend's television has a zoom setting called Cinema or Cinematic, which aaaaalmost gets the image to a 16:9 aspect ratio once again with non-streaming content.\n\nA: You can adjust the screen size on your tv. It worked for me.\n", "Q: WiFi hotspot without internet provider knowing? I have a MacBook Pro with ethernet internet access on a corporate network. Due to corporate restrictions I cannot wire any other device to the network.\nMy solution was to create a wifi-hotspot from the mac to share the internet connection with my other devices.\nI have some privacy concerns. Due to personal reasons I would not like anyone else knowing that I am accessing internet from a second device (please note that this is not illegal or any violation of corporate policy, it is only a matter of privacy). So I have some questions.\nCan the corporate IT admins know that I am accessing at the internet from a different device than the Mac? That is, the HTTP requests that I make from the other device, go through the Mac and then reach the corporate network, are any different than HTTP requests originating from the Mac directly?\n\nA: Any unencrypted HTTP packets (web sites or even streaming commercial content like music) would by default contain the User Agent corresponding to the device and browser/app, which would make it easy to distinguish between devices. It would be rather involved to change the user agent for non-browser traffic; some of those packets are generated deep within the OS.\nEffectively masking a WiFi-connected device would be very difficult, if not practically impossible (depending on the sophistication of IT), if it is iOS or tvOS, or especially if it is a non-Apple device. Different devices and OSes have different characteristics for traffic they create.\nYou could encrypt the traffic with a VPN on the WiFi-connected device(s), but this could easily be noticed and is likely to be a red flag to IT.\nThe easiest combination to hide would be a device identical to the wired device, e.g., a macOS laptop over WiFi to a macOS laptop. Even then, source port number patterns and other markers would be a good clue to IT if they are paying attention.\nIn addition, the mere act of connecting another device is problematic. Operating a WiFi hotspot is likely to be noticed, even (again, depending on IT sophistication) if you hide the SSID. Triangulation could probably isolate the location to within a few machines. You could tether a device using USB, Bluetooth, or another hardware port, but any connected device will also leave forensic clues on the wired device.\n", "Q: diskutil info disk0 shows --> Volume Name: Not applicable (no file system) When i use below command in mac terminal\ndiskutil info disk0\n\nI get:\n Device Identifier:        disk0\n Device Node:              /dev/disk0\n Whole:                    Yes\n Part of Whole:            disk0\n Device / Media Name:      APPLE SSD SM0128G\n\n Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)\n Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)\n File System:              None\n ...\n\nIs it normal that it says no file system? I have not been experiencing any issues with my system so far.\n\nA: Your findings are completely normal for a physical disk like an Apple SSD.\nA common physical disk partitioned in macOS doesn't contain (a) file system(s)  but a partition table, partitions and some unallocated disk space on the first layer.\nConsequently it can't be mounted and has no volume name/file system.\nOn the next layer (disk0sX) a partition usually is formatted with a file system and has a volume name (e.g. disk0s1: FAT32/EFI disk0s2: HFS+/\"Macintosh HD\").\nIn newer systems - especially with SSDs - another layer is added: an LVM (CoreStorage) and disk0s2 as a physical volume is part of an Logical Volume Group (which can contain one or more of them). Almost the entire part of an LVG  (i.e. a logical volume) is formatted with a file system and mounted with a volume name as a new logical disk (usually disk1 in a system with one disk or disk2 in a system with two disks like a Fusion Drive). Small parts of an LVG are not formatted with a common file system but contain administrative data (usually less than 0.3% of the total size of an LVG).\n", "Q: When backing up many Macs to one hard drive, must the hard drive be partitioned for each Mac? I'm getting a 5TB drive which I plan on using for backing up all my media, and my OS/config for my machines. The backup tool is Carbon Copy Cloner. I currently have two Macs but may get a third one and I'm wondering: \nSince the laptops have different OSs and configurations, do I have to partition my 5TB drive for each of these like this:\n╔════════════════════════╗\n║ 500GB - Mac #1 Backup  ║\n║════════════════════════║\n║ 500GB - Mac #3 Backup  ║\n║════════════════════════║\n║ 500GB - Mac #2 Backup  ║\n║════════════════════════║\n║                        ║\n║                        ║\n║ 3500GB - All Media     ║\n║ (movies, music, pics)  ║\n║                        ║\n║                        ║\n║                        ║\n╚════════════════════════╝\n\n...Or, is it safe to put all three machine backups onto the same partition like this:    \n╔════════════════════════╗\n║                        ║\n║                        ║\n║ 1500GB - 3 Mac Backups ║\n║                        ║\n║                        ║\n║════════════════════════║\n║                        ║\n║                        ║\n║ 3500GB - All Media     ║\n║ (movies, music, pics)  ║\n║                        ║\n║                        ║\n║                        ║\n╚════════════════════════╝\n\nI'm suspicious that the former is necessary for the purposes of restoring from a backup so the partitions are \"bootable,\" but I don't understand why this may be needed. If possible, I'd like to use the latter partitioning configuration and just use folders to differentiate between the various Mac backups. Then if something goes wrong, I have the files that I can just drag into place on the machine that I need to restore.\nNote that I am using redundancy with two other 1TB backups but I don't want to rely on those for restoration, only for storing duplicates of my media.\n\nA: If you want the partitions to be bootable, yes you will need a separate partition for each mac you're backing up. The only way to have multiple backups in the same partition is to separate them out into other directories, which is not something most (all?) computers will be able to handle when trying to boot.\nIf you use Time Machine to do your backups, you could back them all up to the same partition. Then while the partition is not bootable, when you boot into recovery on the given mac, you can point at the drive and Time Machine will distinguish between the various backups.\nThe final, most convoluted option could be to use Read/Write disk images, those could be mounted, and backed up to, and then if a system failed, you could directly image the disk image to the new drive. This doesn't buy you a whole lot over backing up to separate folders and just copying the contents of that folder over to a new drive, so I wouldn't really bother with it.\n", "Q: How do I rename app icons on my iPad home screen? How do I rename the apps on my home screen?\nI have tried putting the app icons in edit mode (\"wiggle mode\") but I cannot find a way to rename them.\n\nA: You can't normally rename applications on your home screen(springboard). However if your device is jailbroken i.e you have cydia you can use Icon Renamer to change names of your applications. If you are not jailbroken wait for iOS 11 jailbreak and then rename your icons using this tweak :)\n\nA: You have to give it the name you want when you first add the icon to your home screen.  This might mean adding the link a second time, and putting your desired name in the \"Add to home screen\" facility.  I just click in the middle of the provided name, and delete from there until the cursor is back at the beginning of the field. Then I type the name I want for the shortcut, and delete anything else. After I have added it to the home screen I go and delete the wrongly named one - using the \"jiggle\" process.\n\nA: iOS doesn't have that functionality.  Names of application icons are provided by the application.  You can only name folders.\n\nA: I do this. Use a website to create an item on the home screen. Then you can drag your app on top of the just created item   This will create a “group” consisting of the 2 apps. You can now rename the “group”\n\nA: Create a Shortcut - with the script option to open an App. Pick the app you want to rename. Name the shortcut what you’d like the app to appear as.  Then click on the icon in the name area and pick a color and glyph. Choose the add to Home Screen option.  Now remove the original app grime the Home Screen. Do not uninstall it of course.\n", "Q: Is it possible to keystroke special characters in AppleScript? The Bug:\nFor certain special characters and symbols, AppleScript will fail to keystroke the actual character, and will instead simply type the letter a.\n\nAn Example:\nThe following AppleScript code:\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"² ³ é ½ ₭\"\n\ntypes the following string of text (no matter what application that I am in):\na a a a a\n\n\nA Workaround:\nOne can effectively \"type\" the text by placing the special characters on the clipboard, and then pasting the clipboard, like so:\nset the clipboard to \"² ³ é ½ ₭\"\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down\n\nI avoid using the above method to put text on the clipboard in AppleScript, because it necessarily converts the clipboard to rich text, in the process.\nI prefer to employ the method provided here, to ensure that plain text is placed on the clipboard. But, this method converts special characters to mojibake.\nFor example, using the same string as above, this method puts the following text on the clipboard:\n¬≤ ¬≥ √© ¬Ω ‚Ç≠\n\nYou can manually account for this issue, however, by adding a replace_chars statement for each special character.\n\nThe Question:\nIs there a way to type special characters via AppleScript, without having to involve the clipboard?\nFor example, is there some way that I can add the desired special characters to a \"bank\" or system file somewhere, so that the System Events application is familiar with them?\n\n\nA: It's possible with CoreGraphics (CGEventPost), it's a C API (it doesn't work in a Cocoa-AppleScript), but it's possible to call an executable from an AppleScript.\n\nHere is the method to create the executable with Xcode (Version 8.3.3):\nYou can do it yourself (you can download Xcode from the App Store), or ask a trusted person to create the executable.\n1- Open Xcode, select menu \"File\" --> \"New\" --> \"Project...\"\n\n\n2- Select macOS and Command Line Tool, click on the \"Next\" button.\n\n\n3- Name it TypeCharacters, select Objective-C as Language, click on the \"Next\" button.\n\n\n4- Save the project to the desired folder.\n\n5- In the window of Xcode, select the main.m icon, clear the text in the window and paste one of these two codes:\nThe code need a loop because of a bug, the CGEventKeyboardSetUnicodeString() method truncates a string which exceeds twenty characters, or it's a limit (not documented).\nThis code use a loop to type a list of characters at each iteration, the list can contain one to twenty characters.

I just got a new iMac Early 2009. It's running Mac OS X 10.6.8. I was wondering which Mac OS X version it would be faster to run on since it cannot run the latest macOS. As a developer that is new to Mac, I want something that will be fast and compatible with my current hardware situation & Development Tools. I was thinking Yosemite 10.10 or Mavericks 10.9. Any suggestions on what I should do?\nSpecs:\nIntel Core 2 Duo running on 2.66 GHz.\n2Gb of RAM\nModel Identifier is \"iMac9,1\"\nIf you need anymore specs just let me know.\n\nA: I'm was sorely rempted to -1 your question and then comment, but the comment grew long. You're just trying to make the most of what you have and asking for advice so that's a +1 now.\nUnless you define what \"fast\" is - it's hard for this not to be entirely speculative. Worse, when you define fast - then you make it very narrow and less useful. \nThe OS doesn't really change your CPU and your memory speeds. It doesn't change your filesystem and since you can't run High Sierra and APFS - you're stuck on HFS+ for that Mac.\nAbout the best thing that can come of this \"let's get an answer on which is faster - 10.11 or 10.12 or 10.10\" is the suggestion to partition your drive and test each OS to your needs and then make your call. \nThe downside is you'll likely lose so much more time doing the measuring than just installing the latest OS that runs and then look to optimize what your bottleneck is when you reach them. Another downside would be if someone saw \"10.12 is slow\" and it discourage them from upgrading when for them it would be faster and/or more secure and no more slow.\nI'd say - make a good backup, and then upgrade to the latest OS you can. Old software and not keeping your drive clean from needless files is likely to be far slower than whatever marginal difference you could ever measure on OS versions.\nThe upside of this is you'll have learned some skills on measuring performance and thinking about the end goal \"swift and Xcode\" and then can make decisions like - should I spend $$ on RAM and SSD or find a used Mac with those that is more economical than upgrading a core2 duo machine.\n\nA: With only 2GB for RAM, you can only run OS X Lion, as other System updates require 2GB of RAM, but run optimally with ~8GB. You are welcome to upgrade this to run a newer OS, but you will need to buy more RAM. Apple’s website says that your Mac can support\n\n2GB (two 1GB SO-DIMMs) or 4GB (two 2GB SO-DIMMs) of 1066MHz DDR3\n  SDRAM; two SO-DIMM slots support up to 8GB\n\nFor more info, you can see this article on the Apple Support Site. \nAs with any Mac, the factory OS will always be the fastest, but for the best security, the newest is best. Since you are on the lowest specs, Snow Leapord is likely the best way to go. \nAnother way to make your iMac blazing fast is to install an SSD instead of the factory HDD. Step step to do this can be found on iFixit\n", "Q: MacBook Pro not recognizing USB ethernet adapter in macOS, but does in Bootcamp I have a 2015 MacBook Pro.  I recently moved and don't yet have a Wi-Fi router, so I have to use an ethernet cable.  To do this I'm using a USB ethernet adapter.  \nWhen I plug it in Bootcamp automatically detects it and connects to the internet.  However, when I switch over to macOS, it doesn't detect anything. I've tried to manually set it up, but even then it acts like nothing is there. \nI don't understand why I can connect on one OS but not the other on the same machine. \nHow can I troubleshoot this?\n\nA: If it's the standard Apple ethernet adapter, I've run into this problem on a couple of different MacBooks. There are a few different things you can try in this thread on Apple's message boards, but the one that usually works for me is this one:  \n\n\n*\n\n*in System Preferences > Network, create a new network location\n\n*delete all the network devices from the list on the left\n\n*re-add the ethernet adapter device\n\n*configure the rest of the new location as required, and use it instead of the one you were previously using\n\n\n(Even with that working, I still have another annoying issue with the adapter: if I plug it in while the laptop is asleep, it's not detected when it wakes. Have never found a solution for that.)\n\nA: It does this because there is a driver for whatever this adapter is in the one OS, but not in the other OS.\nYou would therefore install the missing driver on the OS where the adapter does not work.\n", "Q: Copy macOS installation to second partition I am running macOS Sierra 10.12.5 on the 4th partition of my HDD. The partitions in order: \n\nPartition 1, 280 MB: EFI\nPartition 2, 22 GB: Storage 1\nPartition 3, 186 GB: Storage 2\nPartition 4, 110 GB: Macintosh HD\nPartition 5, 600 MB: Recovery HD\n\nStorage 2 has 102 GB available, and Macintosh HD only has 66 GB used, so space is not a problem. I need to copy my macOS installation from Macintosh HD to Storage 2, so that I can delete Macintosh HD, and expand Storage 2 to include the now free 110 GB. The catch is that I need to preserve all the data on both partitions while copying the installation. User data, system preferences, my command line package managers, everything. Plus in doing so I need Storage 2 to become a bootable volume. Neither reinstalling macOS, wiping Storage 2 for a restore from Macintosh HD, or wiping and repartitioning the whole disk are options here (I don't have a spare drive large enough to store all that data on.). \nI have tried a simple sudo cp -R / /Volumes/Storage\\ 2/ (from in-OS that is), but some files have read/copy permissions denied even to the root user, and that's with SIP off. So... anyone have any ideas? I'm not partial to either the GUI or command line, so long as it gets the job done.

When I was with my former employer, I had to install a series of corporate and company related apps so that they could monitor my phone. After leaving the company, I used the option \"Erase All Content and Settings\" so that my phone can start fresh. Does that mean the phone is completely disconnected from my ex-employer and I can treat it as a brand new phone?\n\nA: That would really depend on how they went about doing the monitoring, on a functional level. Seeing as it was originally distributed by corporate for use in-company it's entirely possible that their apps were designed to modify the iPhone's system in a way that apps on the App Store would normally be prohibited from doing. Seeing as they were privately designed apps for use on private company property there wouldn't be much stopping them from designing the apps to inject monitoring software into the system storage, where the user cannot access or remove it, in an attempt to stop employees from simply uninstalling the apps to bypass the monitoring software.\nTo be completely safe I would recommend putting the iPhone in recovery mode, connecting it to a Mac with a stable (and private/secured) internet connection, and completely reinstalling the firmware & OS via iTunes' restore feature.\nTo put the phone into iTunes recovery mode, sometimes called \"DFU mode\" or \"Firmware Update Mode\" follow the steps below:\n\nWarning: Make sure to disable \"Find My iPhone\" and delete the connected iCloud account from the device before following these steps, or it may be left unusable after the restore has finished.\n1.) Remove the SIM card from the device.  \n2.) Press and hold both Power and Home for 30 seconds. The screen should go black around the 20 second mark, this is because the phone has shut off. The boot screen (Apple logo) will appear on screen, keep holding both the power and home button for another 10 seconds.\n3.) On the 30th second the screen should turn black again. As soon as it does, let go of the power button, but keep holding down the home button for another 30 seconds.\n4.) On the 60th second let go of the home button. The screen should now remain black as though the phone is powered off. If the Apple logo appears on screen try again from step 1. If the screen remains dark it means the phone is now in iTunes recovery mode.\n5.) Open iTunes, plug the phone into the Mac, and a window should pop up saying that an iPhone in recovery mode has been detected, and that it has to be restored before it can be used.\n6.) Click the \"Update & Restore\" button, and wait for the process to finish. Make sure the cable does not disconnect during any point of the restore process, if your cable is finicky grab a better one, or buy a new one.\n7.) When iTunes says the process has completed, and the phone reboots: reinsert the SIM card. The phone's firmware and OS will have both been erased and reinstalled from the newest version on Apple's update servers. This means it is essentially no different from a new iPhone straight out of the box, and any spyware or monitoring programmes will definitely be gone at this point.\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina 15\" Mid-2015 and Ultrawide Monitors (LG and Acer) I'd like to be able to use a 38\" ultrawide LG 38Uc99-W monitor or the Acer XR382CQK with my 15\" Mid-2015 Retina Macbook Pro with an Intel GPU (not the Radeon).\nHere are the specs for my Macbook Pro: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp719?locale=en_US\nHere are the specs for the LG monitor: http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-38UC99-W-ultrawide-monitor\nHere are the specs for the Acer monitor: https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/UM.TX2AA.001\nMy understanding is that the Thunderbolt 2 digital video port can connect to the DisplayPort 1.2 on the monitor and that the Macbook can drive the 3840 x 1600 monitor.  In fact, it can drive two of these displays.\nIs this the correct cable to connect the laptop to the monitor: http://a.co/6p9WBrV?\nIs this correct? Am I missing anything?  \n\nA: Yes, Thunderbolt 2 is indeed compatible with DisplayPort 1.2. On top of that you should have no issue running a resolution of 3840x1600 on an external monitor via your MacBook. You will likely have to set the resolution manually though. After connecting the monitor, just head to System Preferences>Display>Your Monitor and hold option while clicking the \"Scaled\" radio-button to show a full list of available resolutions.\nHowever do be wary that Night Shift is not officially compatible with any displays besides the internal Mac displays, the Apple Thunderbolt Monitor, and the LG UltraFine 4K/5K monitors. There is a common problem on unsupported external monitors where Night Shift will become permanently enabled, and will even stop Night Shift's scheduling and intensity settings from working properly on the Mac's internal monitor. I wrote a guide about fixing this by tricking your Mac into thinking your external monitor is internal. This will also prevent another problem where some external monitors get stuck in mirroring mode on newer versions of macOS. You can find that here: Fixing Night Shift incompatibility with external monitors\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Input/Output audio not found I have an audio problem on my MackBook with the following specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*MB Pro Retina (13 inch Early 2015)\n\n*Operation System: macOS Sierra 10.12.5 \n\n\nHere is the chronology of the problem: Initially, everything was okay. I could hear music from iTunes on my MBP connected with a cable to an external speaker. Then I accidentally unplugged the cable on the speaker, so I plugged it in again but then I couldn't hear sound from my MacBook anymore. \nI have tried the following solutions to address this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting my MacBook\n\n*Reinstalling my operating system\n\n*Resetting both NVRAM and SMC\n\n*Plugging and unplugging to/from the audio jack on the MBP\n\n*Killing coreaudiod on Activity Monitor\n\n*Deleting the apple.bezleservices.plist file at ~Library/Preferences/com.apple.BezelServices.plist\n\n*Taking it into Apple Store Service near my town\n\n\nThe Apple Store said it was a hardware issue, but I'm not sure on this.

I discovered that when I plugged in my external speakers (in the radio plug port), my System Preferences defaulted to a lower volume output setting (presumably to prevent blasting out too much volume in small speakers).  Try opening System Preferences and resetting the output volume to a higher setting.\n", "Q: Available colors in iTerm / terminal.app I'm trying to make my own colorscheme in Vim, but are struggling to see the available colors in iTerm.

Next, open\n  Terminal and cd into the directory where your ZIP file is located. If\n  it’s a long path, just type “cd “, then drag the folder into Terminal\n  (less typing is always good).\nNow type the following:\nzip -d your-archive.zip \"__MACOSX*\" \nAnd that should do it. This\n  command (zip) will remove everything (-d) starting with __MACOSX from\n  your ZIP file (your-archive.zip).\nTo verify, type the following:\nunzip -l your-archive.zip \nThis will simply list the contents of\n  your-archive.zip.\n\nIf you're not comfortable with Terminal, BetterZip has an option to do this for you, but it's $25.\n\nA: Using info from the other answer, here's an Automator Service1 that becomes available in Finder to delete the \"__MACOSX\" meta-data folder from a zip archive file.\nTo Create the Service:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and select: File > New > Service\n\n*Set Service receives selected to files or folders and in to Finder.\n\n*Add a Run Shell Script Action, setting Shell: to /bin/bash and Pass input: to as arguments while replacing the default code with the following code:\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    if [[ ${f##*.} =~ ^[zZ][iI][pP]$ ]]; then\n        zip -d \"$f\" \"__MACOSX*\"\n    fi\ndone\nafplay /System/Library/Sounds/Purr.aiff\n\n\n\n*\n\n*What the code does: It checks that each file passed to the service has a zip extension, regardless of case, and if it has a zip extension, and if \"__MACOSX\" exists within the zip archive, deletes the \"__MACOSX\" meta-data folder from the zip archive.\n\n*${f##*.} gets the file extension, =~ tests the regex, and the ^[zZ][iI][pP]$ regex matches any case combination of each letter within the square braces while ^ asserts position at start of the string and $ asserts position at the end of the string. So it only matches zip in any case combination of those letters.\n\n*Note: The last line of the code is optional, just to let you know the service completed, and can be changed to a different sound or omitted if you prefer not to be notified by sound upon completion. \n\n\n*Save the Service as, e.g.,: Delete '__MACOSX' from Zip Archive\n1 In macOS Mojave, and later, an Automator Service is called a Quick Action. There are also other minor nomenclature differences but they should be more obvious when comparing them to pre-macOS Mojave Automator workflows. \nTo Use the Service:\nIn Finder, or on the Desktop if the zip archive is located there, select the zip archive(s), then right-click and select Delete '__MACOSX' from Zip Archive from the context menu or under Services on the context menu, or from Services on the Finder menu as appropriate.\nThe image of the service in Automator, below, is from OS X 10.8.6, however, it was tested under macOS 10.12.5 and works there as well.\n\n\nA: Like user3439894 said, try third-party solution.  I'm using free application Keka with success, long term:\nhttp://www.kekaosx.com/en/\nConfigure in Keka preferences to not create mac-specific files in archives. It can also be used via the context menu (after adding \"Compress with Keka.workflow\" to your \"~/Library/Services\" folder), see the link at the bottom left of their website.\n", "Q: Just downloaded a text editor (atom), but the file sits in my downloads folder. How can I add it to my applications? I downloaded Atom which is a third party text editor. Okay, great! However the file is only in my downloads, and when I add it to the bar at the bottom, sometimes my Mac doesn't seem to know where it's looking (i.e. comes up with a question mark).\nSo I have to open up Atom via the downloads folder. This is time consuming - is there any way I can fix this?\n\nA: I am assuming you are installing the atom through a DMG file. In most cases when you open the DMG file you see the application itself and a shortcut to Applications folder. You just need to drag the application and drop it in Applications shortcut icon and the application gets copied to Applications folder.\nHowever if you don't see anything like that you have to manually move files of this text editor to applications folder so you can directly access it from there and make a shortcut on your dock. \n\n\nWhen you run atom from your downloads folder you see a little white drive like icon, it is the disk image, which is the container for the program after copying you can eject the disk and you'll still have the program. \nNow the shortcut on your dock will work perfectly fine and you will not get that question mark again. \n\nA: You can move it to your Applications folder: just drag-and-drop from the Downloads folder.\nThen open it from that folder, right click in it's icon in the Dock, go to Options -> Keep in Dock.\nAlternatively you can launch it with Spotlight. Just hit CMD+Space and type Atom.\n", "Q: In Photos, can you crop and scale original to save space? I often take photos of documents, receipts, or product packaging; to have as a record. These photos usually waste space because they are higher resolution than I need, and they have extra space around edges that can be cropped.  \nTo save space I export the image, scale and crop in Preview, and delete the original from Photos. This is a pain. Can I accomplish the same thing in Photos on macOS?\n\nA: Any edit will always increase space used, as it will keep the original in Masters & add a new edited version. \nIt's the 'safest' method which is why I presume it's done that way.  \nIf you want total control over your pictures, you need a more pro-oriented application.\nHaving said that - my own workflow only uses Photos as a 'show it to people & carry it on the phone' structure. All my real work I do in Photoshop, ViewNX-i etc... but the downside of that is I end up with far more safety copies & work in progress/files with different icc profiles etc than I would if I just used Photos.\nOne picture can end up having 1GB of variations, + backups in 2 other locations.\n", "Q: Upgrading to 32GB RAM for Mac mini Server (MD389LL/A) I'm using a Mac mini Server (Late 2012) with 2,3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB RAM. This type of processor (Intel® Core™ i7-3615QM) supports a max memory size of 32GB. Look at specification: Here.\nIs it possible to upgrade RAM in my Mac mini to 32GB (for instance a Crucial Kit 2x16GB)?\nI understand that Apple has to update Memory Reference Code in the firmware of the Mac mini but maybe exists another way to upgrade a memory.\n\nA: No. That Mac mini is limited to 16 GB max ram. \nYou can be pretty sure that if it's not mentioned in Everymac or sold by OWC[MacSales] or ramjet.com, it can't be done. These reputable sellers will always provide good research and advice if more memory can be used past Apple official specifications. \nWhether you would choose them as your vendor or not, they tend to cover all possibilities & often support things that Apple never intended.\n\nA: Anyway, I'm afraid I have some bad news for people hoping for more than 16 GB total memory. \nDue to an intel Core i hardware design defect, seems to have been fixed only for 4th or 5th generation Core i processors, the previous generations won't take 16GB DDR3 modules although the parameters for such modules were established within the original DDR3 specs. \nSo, it should work, but it doesn't. \nIntel's fault.\nSorry. \n", "Q: How do I disable the Apple ID sign in when logging into my Mac?

And how should I achieve the goal?\n\n\nA: Since resizing the partition that is currently mounted for the operating system is impossible and the filesystem (FS) may be corrupted. One of the solutions is to use a live CD, especially GParted Live ISO which has installed many tools related to disk management such as partition.\nHowever, GParted can check the integrity of the FS, but it is not able to resize the partition to the maximum size.

I do not want iCloud to back up my files from my computer. I only want to use iCloud for e-mail.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> iCloud (it's in the third row), and uncheck the iCloud Drive option:\n\nIt will ask you if you want to keep a copy of the files currently in iCloud, so you can immediately store them somewhere else if you want to. And you have to delete those files manually in iCloud to free up space, e.g. via https://www.icloud.com/.\n", "Q: I've set up iCloud music library but iMac still shows 25 G used, Why is this? I've set up iCloud music library on my iPhone, iPad and iMac. The music folder on my iMac shows about 25 gigs used. I thought the music was moved to iCloud.  What am I missing here and what should I do to free up that memory.\nOver half of that 25 Gigs is 'Mobile Applications' which are apps on my iPad and iPhone. Can I delete these or move to my external drive?\n\nA: It's not moved to iCloud; it's just uploaded, as a kind of backup. You can just remove the music via iTunes; it will ask you if you want to delete it from iCloud as well, or if you only want to delete the local copy.\nHave you set up backup via iCloud for your iPhone and iPad? If so, you can delete the mobile applications; the apps themselves are not backed up (so they don't take iCloud storage space) but will be readily downloaded from the App Store archives when you restore a backup. (Backup via iCloud does take storage space, but for local files and settings.)\n[EDIT]\nShould you ever want to re-install an app to your iPhone and/or iPad that is no longer available on the App Store (or an older version of an app that's no longer available) then having a local copy is advantageous. \nHowever, assuming you have a backup regime in place (e.g. you have Time Machine enabled) then your iTunes library should already be backed up, so in theory you'd still have local copies of your apps available (at least until they're overwritten).\n", "Q: I can't record my voice using GarageBand, but can still record instruments I installed v2.0.7 of GarageBand to my iPad a few months ago. \nI've just tried recording my voice using the audio option and it told me I did not have enough free storage. However, I can still record using the other instruments provided by GarageBand, so space doesn't seem to be the issue.\nHow can I troubleshoot this to determine why I can't do a voice recording using GarageBand?\n\nA: I'm assuming the Instruments are already-loaded samples, you're just lining up along a track, or as a midi track to fire single note samples.  \nIf so, that requires very little additional storage - the samples are already there, it just needs to remember what order they go in. \nAn actual audio recording, on the other hand, is going to eat about 5MB data per minute, mono, or 10MB/m stereo.\n", "Q: Why did my desktop and documents suddenly get renamed \"Desktop - Local\" and \"Documents - Local\"? Here's my iCloud settings:\n\nAs you can see, the Desktop and Documents Folders checkbox is unchecked. \nDespite this, my Desktop and Documents folders have suddenly been renamed to \"Desktop - Local\" and \"Documents - Local\" respectively.\nThe only reason I can think of is this may be due to installing iOS 11 on my iPhone, but I'm not sure.\nCan anyone suggest any other possible reasons?\n\nA: This is caused by iCloud Drive. This is to distinguish it with the Desktop and Documents folders on your iCloud Drive, which are named \"Documents — iCloud\", even if you didn't setup iCloud Drive on your Mac. \nThe most probable cause, as found by the OP and me, is installing and running the new Files app on iOS 11.\n\n\nA: You’ve got two folders called Documents, one on iCloud Drive and the other one on your Home directory. It will says - Local or iCloud unless you deleted Documents folder on your iCloud Drive as it cannot be renamed. Best to create a new folder and move contents within Documents in iCloud Drive into new created folder labelled something different name other than Documents. Then you will see without - Local or iCloud.\n", "Q: I logged out of iCloud on my iPhone and now it won't let me log back in The password is correct and it doesn't even say its wrong. Instead I get a verifying message and then it never logs in. \nI'm not sure what the issue is because my iPhone literally just goes back to the log in screen after it says verifying and that's it.\nHow can I troubleshoot this? \n\nA: This answer offers an alternative to the one posted by user @Sacha on May 10th of 2018. For Apple users (like me) that cannot remove 2-factor authentication (because their account does not feature the link to do so), try this:\n\n*\n\n*Log into your Apple account from a computer (appleid.apple.com or icloud.com). That step will require you to use your 2-factor authentication, as expected, so have your phone handy.\n\n*Scroll to the \"devices\" section. Verify that all shown devices are correct and not listed more than once. In my case, my iPhone was listed twice and that seemed to confuse the iCloud login algorithm. If that's the case, remove all duplicate(s) from the \"devices\" list so you only have a single phone listed there, and log out.\n\n*From your phone, try logging in again to iCloud.\n\n*If that still does not work, log into your Apple account from your computer again, and remove the device causing problem from the list completely. Log out. Now you have a clean slate.\n\n*Grab your phone, and try logging in again to iCloud. This time, you may need to force the 2-factor code to be sent by SMS, instead of iMessages (since you might no longer have access to the iMessage app).\n\n*Hopefully, this time around, your iPhone will complete the login process into iCloud and you will see your device on the Apple account page next time you access it.\n\n\nA: This happened to me also. I somehow found it that my two factor authentication had been turned on.\nDisabling Two-Factor Authentication on Apple ID\n1.Open any web browser on any computer and go to icloud.com or appleid.apple.com\n2.Log in to the Apple ID you want to disable two factor authentication for, you may need to use two factor auth to gain access to the account\n3.Go to the “Security” section of account settings and choose “Edit”\n4.Locate the “Two-Factor Authentication” section where it says the feature is ON, and click the link to “Turn Off Two-Factor Authentication”\n5.Create new security questions to assign to the Apple ID, these are used in place of two-factor auth codes\n6.When finished disabling two-factor auth you can log out of the Apple ID management website\nOnce two-factor authentication is disabled, you can log in to Apple ID from anywhere, whether on the web, iOS, iPhone, iPad, Mac, anywhere, with only a password again, you won’t need to double authenticate with a trusted device code. \nWhether or not to use two-factor authentication is largely a matter of personal preference, there is no right or wrong answer here. Remember, you can always turn on two-factor auth for Apple ID again if you decide to use the service again at a later date. Either way, be sure to use a strong password. \n\nA: Yet another answer, more simple than the other ones posted here, that I also tested successfully on my (now pretty old) iPhone 5C device to solve this aborted iCloud login problem:\n\n*\n\n*Grab your phone and go to \"Settings\" > \"iTunes & App Stores\"\n\n*Login from there using your Apple ID, password (and 2-factor authentication if applicable)\n\n*Wait a bit (it may take a few seconds for Apple to resolve multiple logins).\n\n*Scroll back up to \"Settings\": you should now see your name and picture ID, indicating that you're also logged to iCloud. If not, stop the \"Settings\" app and reopen it to force it to refresh.\n\nThat is just an oblique way to log in when trying directly via iCloud does not work.\n", "Q: Shortcut to insert / paste email address?

Even better: Allow me to define additional \"paste items\".\n\nA: Built in to the operating system is text replacements, so if you open Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Text Replacement you can add your own text replacement shortcuts. For example, you might add \"e@\" and have it expand to your full email address, such as \"email@domain.com\". It will automatically expand when tabbing away from a field or hitting the space key on your keyboard.\n\n\nA: It seems the Clips app provides what you're looking for. It's basically a clipboard manager, which comes with a custom keyboard extension that lets you paste copied texts into text fields. It's a free app available in the App Store.\n\n", "Q: Using the same partition for both Time Machine and other files Is it harmful or dangerous to the other files in the same partition as the Time Machine?\nBecause a lack of storage, every time the Time Machine backs up my Mac, it deletes the oldest backup. Is there a danger that the Time Machine is about to delete my other files in this partition?\nThese are my folders in the hard drive. You can see that there are some folders of the Time Machine, besides a folder of my files - Archive:\n\n\nA: According to this HowToGeek article, as long as you don't put anything in the Backups.backupdb, you will be fine.\nThe Time Machine only deletes files inside the Backups.backupdb folder.\nSo your Archive folder and the files in it should be fine.\nRelevant paragraphs from the HowToGeek article.\n\nThe easiest way to store files on your Time Machine drive is just placing the files on there directly. Plug in your Time Machine drive and open it in the Finder. You’ll see a folder named “Backups.backupdb”. Time Machine stores all its backup files under this folder. Just leave this folder alone and let Time Machine use it normally.\nPlace personal files and folders outside the Backups.backupdb folder. Don’t place anything inside the Backups.backupdb folder — Time Machine automatically deletes files and folders inside there to free up space, so you may find your personal files deleted if put them there.\n\n", "Q: External SSD won't unmount due to socketfilterfw When trying to unmount my Samsung T3, which I store various applications like Mathematica on, I am told it is being used by some software socketfilterfw\n$ diskutil unmount /dev/disk2s1\nVolume External on disk2s1 failed to unmount: dissented by PID=304 \n(/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw)\n\nThis also shows when unmounting using the GUI and checking in Console.app\nI think socketfilterfw is involved in the firewall, however I'm not sure how to fix it or why it is happening, and whether or not it is safe for the SSD to force unmounting.\nWhat options do I have?\n\nA: The easiest and safest thing is to log out of the account on the Mac. (Apple Menu - log out)\nThis does two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*All applications are told to quit and you can identify any apps that are stuck / hung.\n\n*All drives are safely unmounted as part of the normal log out process (unless you have an odd setup where you installed software that mounts the drive before the user logs in).\n\n\nOnce you have done that, you can either power off the Mac (to ensure all possibility that the drive is safely shut down and open files are not corrupted) or disconnect the drive.\nPulling a drive that's journaled and HFS+ (or the new APFS) is safe in that you won't corrupt the filesystem. What is at risk is each data file that's still open - so you would lose your word file, your iTunes library that lists playlists / ratings, etc.. (but not the songs themselves).\nAs to the socket filter - you might need to dig a bit in activity monitor or terminal to know why that was identified as using the device. It's probably relating to the apps you run off that device - Google Chrome will run updaters, perhaps Mathematica runs some licensing software that connects to the network (a school license server or back to the vendor). If you can make this error happen on a newly rebooted Mac several times - then it should be easy to look over each running app and trace why the filesystem is blocked and active.\n", "Q: Way for new Mac touch bar to behave the same as the Old keyboard The new touch bar is not very good for people good at keyboard shortcuts and development.\nI used to be able to press Shift F8 to get iTunes to play without giving it focus.\nHow can I get the F10,F11 etc. keys to always display on Chrome without pressing Fn, on touch bar Mac?\nThis makes debugging annoying.\n\nA: In the system preferences go to \"Keyboard\".

I just downloaded Sierra 10.12.5 on my MacBook. I had to set up mail and it automatically started downloading a lot of email that I had already read. \nI opened the screen all the way blocking the body of the message so that all I could see was the email senders so I could easily delete all of the unwanted emails.\nSo now my issue is for some reason I cannot move that curser back up to see the body of messages. It simply will not move.\n\nA: This can sometimes be cured by removing mail accounts first and then adding all your mail accounts again. It won't affect your mail accounts in any way even if you remove it since the mail is on the server and mail will keep any messages downloaded permanently from the account.\nYou could make a backup if you are worried about losing mail.\nAlso - be sure a simple reboot doesn't unjam things.\n", "Q: How can I use EarPods with a dumb phone I would like to use Apple EarPods with a Nokia 130 (dumb phone). I only need sound and microphone to work. I don't expect the volume control to work, since I assume it's proprietary.\n\n\n*\n\n*Inserting the EarPods directly into the Nokia gives no sound at all. If I keep the connector halfway in, I get sound, but this is obviously not a permanent solution.\n\n*I tried an adapter with a female connector for the EarPods (4 pins) and a male connector (3 pins) for the Nokia. This gives me sound, but the microphone does not work.\n\n*I also tried using a cheap EarPods copy on the Nokia, which works for both sound and microphone (even if it has 4 pins like the original EarPods...!), but with bad quality (no bass).\n\n\nCan someone recommend an adapter where:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sound works\n\n*Microphone works\n\n*Does not degrade audio quality\n\n*Is as small and simple as possible\n\n\nA: The issue here is a little more interesting than it appears on the surface.\nBoth your old Nokia and the EarPods use a 3.5mm audio jack with support for four \"poles\", each one providing a different purpose. Each one has left, right, ground, and microphone. However, your old Nokia uses the OMTP standard, while the EarPods use the CTIA/AHJ standard. This means the ground and microphone are switched between the two.\n\nYou'll need an adapter like this one to get the EarPods working properly.\n", "Q: Why does Calendar.app offer these addresses when I type \"at home\" in the location field? I don't recognize any of the addresses offered by Calendar.app, when I type \"at home\" in the location field.

I am following the steps here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904 \nI am using the  Opt ⌥   Cmd ⌘   R   option on startup to install the latest OS compatible with my device. When I get to the erase screen, I see the following hard drive items listed:\n\nThis is different than what the directions are showing. Should I be erasing both \"Macintosh HD\" and \"disk1\"? I've never made any changes to my hard drive, it's a MacBook Pro 2014. Not sure why there are two entries there.\n\nA: 'disk1' is a temporary structure & the 'disk' you are currently booted from, generated by the image you downloaded from Apple as part of Internet Recovery.\nIt will disappear as soon as you boot regularly from your HD.\nThat's how you are able to format your main 'Macintosh HD' drive, which you cannot do from the drive you are booted from.  \nYou can verify this since the system won’t let you erase disk1 even if you attempt that operation - that’s a snake eating its own tail situation. \n", "Q: Installed mpv with Brew, but nothing in Applications I'm trying to play anime with mpv. I have heard that it's the best player for anime.\nhttps://mpv.io/installation/\nI go to the website and I see that there's homebrew.\nI run brew install mpv. It seems to complete successfully. Now what?\nThere doesn't seem to be an mpv app I can use to open my video files in my /Applications.\n\nA: Most of the suggestions here no longer work, the current one as of Dec 2020 is:\nbrew install --cask mpv\n\n\nA: As brew linkapps is now deprecated, the correct way to do this is to use the --with-bundle option when installing mpv.\nbrew install mpv --with-bundle\n\nBecause you said you have mpv installed with brew already, it's better to uninstall mpv first with brew uninstall mpv --force After that, run the installation command above.\nWhen the installation is finished, go to your mpv installation folder:\n\n/usr/local/Cellar/mpv/[version]/\n\nYou will see an mpv.app in there. Right-click mpv.app > Make Alias. Copy/move the mpv.app alias into your Applications folder. Remove the 'alias' from the filename, so you'll have \"mpv.app\" in your Applications :)\nReference: mpv formula in homebrew's repository - \nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/mpv.rb#L14\nI prefer using --with-bundle rather than cask install as it allows me to use more compile options and to install different versions of mpv (e.g. --HEAD) as opposed to the pre-built package that cask install uses. Hope this helps!\n\nA: If you want to have the application linked to ~/Applications, have homebrew do that.\nbrew linkapps mpv\n\nSince \"linkapps\" is being removed (for reasons) across all brew recipes, you might instead tap the cask which drops a functioning mpv into Applications and runs more like an app than a command line tool.\nbrew install mpv --cask\n\n\nA: Actually an .mpv file is nothing more than a specific format of MPEG2 video. There is nothing specific to Anime in an .MPV file. In fact you can find Anime in a multitude of video formats all over the internet. \nDeciding on what is the \"best\" player for MPV files is more opinion than anything else and Ask Different discourages opinion based questions.\nThe specific player you have chosen will work fine but would not be my (ahem...) first choice as it involves a lot of stuff that is totally unnecessary for playing videos, specifically the installation of Homebrew. Homebrew is very nice but is basically an environment designed for installing Unix-style executables quickly and easily without invoking the use of compilers, shell scripts or other things that many people have no interest in. A bit of overhead for a simple media player.\nIf all you want to do is play an .mpv file your best bet might be the insanely popular and excellent quality VLC player. It's a direct (web browser link)  download and install and requires nothing more than running the installer in the download. Works a treat and I have been using it successfully for years.\n", "Q: How to efficiently mark mail as spam before reviewing it in Mac OS X Mail.app? If my ISP marks an email as spam, and moves it to the spam folder before the Mac OS X Mail.app sees it, Mail.app does not mark these emails as spam.\nThis wouldn’t be too bad if there was a way for me to efficiently mark these as spam (so that I can review them just in case without triggering one-pix image trackers and the like), but there does not seem to be one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard shortcuts are a non-starter, as they require the message to be selected first.\n\n*Right-clicking the emails one by one to mark them as spam (which requires going in a submenu each time) is tiresome.\n\n*In Lion, I could select multiple of them (being careful never to select only one spam) and mass-mark as spam without viewing any of them, but that stopped working when Mail.app got the ability to show multiple message selections as a pile of messages.\n\n*I can re-position the dividers or resize the window to hide the message view pane and mass-mark at that time, but that requires re-positioning them back manually each time, and that won’t do.\n\n\nIs there something I have missed?\n\nA: One solution would be select all those messages and mark them as Junk using an iOS device, which would not load/preview emails until they’re opened.\nYou can also run the following AppleScript:\ntell application \"Mail\" to set junk mail status of (messages of mailbox \"QUARANTINE\" of account \"NAME\" whose junk mail status is false) to true\nReplace NAME with the name of your account, as defined under Mail → Preferences → Accounts.\nYou can then run that script anytime you want to mark all those messages as junk.\nYou could even setup a rule under Mail → Preferences → Rules:\n\n\n*\n\n*If any of the following conditions are met: Every Message\n\n*Perform the following actions: Run AppleScript\n\n*In the dropdown click Open in Finder.\n\n*Drop your .scpt file into the window that opens up.\n\n*Select that script in the action’s dropdown menu.\n\n*Set this rule as your topmost rule, so that it runs before any rule that ends with Stop evaluating rules.\n\n", "Q: Unlock iPhone for different carrier I bought an iPhone 6 from an O2 shop thinking I could use it with a different carrier. But to my horror, I found it was actually locked to O2! How can I unlock it?\nMy research so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask O2 to unlock it. (This takes 28 days though, not an option).\n\n*Jail breaking (Not advised I know. I'm tempted if it works though?)\n\n\nAny other options?\n\nA: The only way to do this in a supported way without jailbreaking the phone is to have O2 do it. There's simply no other way. They have to send a carrier update to the phone which unlocks it.\nIf you want it done faster, I would recommend returning the phone if you can and purchase an unlocked one straight from Apple.\nI don't know how UK law works, but in the US, carriers are required to unlock your phone if you have no financial obligation to them for the device. Any phone you buy directly from Apple won't have any kind of carrier lock on it.\n\nA: This depends heavily on which version of iOS it's running, and what the lowest version it's capable of running is. Back in older versions of iOS (I believe up to iOS7) there was a program called \"UltraSn0w\" that would do exactly what you need. I have not jailbroken a device newer than iOS7, so I cannot say with certainty, but I believe most available jailbreaks on newer iOS versions are rootless, meaning the user is no longer granted superuser privileges by jailbreaking, thus you wont be able to modify the system to perform an unlock with a rootless jailbreak.\nWith that said it is entirely possible that there are still normal rooted jailbreaking programmes available, I simply don't have experience with them. \nIf you do choose to jailbreak your iPhone I highly recommend a rooted jailbreak if possible. Contrary to popular belief rooted jailreaking your device is not actually dangerous (at least, not any more dangerous than knowing the administrator account's password on a Mac.). All jailbreaking a device actually does is install the program su, or \"SuperUser\", as well as install the package manager dpkg. \nsu is preinstalled on all standard copies of Unix, from macOS, to Ubuntu, to good old System III, and is basically just a program for performing administrative tasks like changing the system clock's date, setting the machine to run a program during startup, installing new software, etc. On iPhones, iPods, iPads, and Apple TVs the user can't run the su program, and is thus unable to do any of the above things without using an Apple app to do it (i.e. the App Store for installing new software, the Setting.app for changing the date, etc.).\nWhen you jailbreak an iDevice, half of the whole process is your jailbreaking program of choice installing a second copy of the su program in a part of the device's storage that the user can access with normal apps, allowing them to administrate their device manually. While this could potentially be dangerous on it's own, all the access to the su program is handled through Cydia.app, which brings me to the second half of a jailbreak.\ndpkg and Cydia.app are both installed during a jailbreak as well, dpkg is the package manager used by many different versions of Unix, including Debian, and can also be installed on macOS, iOS, tvOS, FreeBSD, and most versions of Linux. dpkg is essentially just for installing and removing software, and gets installed so that the user can install apps from downloaded .deb, .dpkg, and .pkg files, along with the normal .ipa files used by the App Store, the same way a user can install .pkg and .app files manually on macOS.\nCydia.app is basically an alternate version of the App Store that lets you install Linux, command-line, and system software, rather than just Apps. Such software includes, but is not limited to, extra panels in Settings.app, software that changes the way the SpringBoard (home screen & multitasker) look and work, and Apps that can do things like browse, move, and edit the files on the device how one would with Finder on macOS.\nAs a result of this process the user can install (or uninstall) most any system software they want, including software that restricts the device to a specific carrier. In order to do this you would either need to find a piece of software for jailbroken iDevices that removes the carrier restriction, or find a way to manually uninstall the software that locks you to its current carrier.\nTL;DR It's definitely possible to unlock your iDevice with a jailbreak, but you have to make sure it's a rooted jailbreak (rootless jailbreak wont work), and you'll have to find a program that can be downloaded from Cydia that removes the carrier restriction for you. I believe there is a newer version of the aforementioned UltraSn0w that can do this on newer versions of iOS, but you should definitely look around and make sure such a program exists before jailbreaking the phone, assuming a carrier unlock is your only reason for jailbreaking.\n", "Q: Notes no longer sync from iOS (iphone and ipad) to OSX (macbook) I've got a Macbook pro running OSX 10.10.5, an iPhone 5s running 10.3.2 and an ipad mini 4 running 1.3.2.\nIve noticed that notes that I make on my iPhone or iPad don't seem to be syncing with the notes app on my laptop. This happened around the time I upgraded my iOS on the phone from iOS 9 to iOS 10. \nI've checked and I'm still logged into my iCloud correctly on all devices. \nWhen I go to icloud.com I can see the notes there correctly also. \nAny ideas why the notes seem to have stopped syncing to my laptop and how to fix it? \n\nA: Once upgraded, iOS 10.x notes won't sync with OS X 10.10 any more.\nApple has added new features to Notes in iOS 9, and again in iOS 10. Because of these new features, iOS 9 Notes cannot be synced to OS X version before 10.11 (El Capitan), and - as far as I remember - iOS 10 Notes cannot be synced to OS X before 10.12 (macOS Sierra).\nYour iOS device had probably warned you before upgrading your notes, but you might have forgotten about that.\n\nA: Here are some things you can try:\nLog onto iCloud.com and check which notes are present there. This gives you a good idea of which device is properly connected to the Cloud.\nThe devices which are syncing based on this can be set aside.\nOn the devices that are not, first verify iCloud Notes are enabled. Then, open Notes and verify the location of the notes. The notes should be kept in \"iCloud\", not in the local \"On my iPhone\" account, or in the account for any of your email providers.\nIf you have verified that iCloud Notes are on, and that the notes are in the iCloud account, you can try turning Notes off then on. If you have newer notes that have not yet synced to iCloud, I recommend moving them to your \"On my iPhone\" account before doing this (you may need to enable the account in Notes settings).\n\nA: Use a web browser or create a fake Notes App with Fluid\nIf you are working in some version of Mac below 10.10 (or even worse, bellow 10.9), your build-in Notes App do not synchronize with your iCloud account (even if you selected that option in System Preference --> iCloud).\nYou can, of course, use a web browser to edit your Notes in iCloud.\nHowever, I would recommend using Fluid to create a fake Notes App.\nIn fact, I really enjoyed this method so much that I also created a Fluid App for the Reminders.\nProcedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download here the last version of Fluid compatible with 10.11.\n\n*Install as usual and launch the application.\n\n*In the URL field introduce this: https://icloud.com/#notes2\n\n*In the Name Field introduce, for example, \"Notes (Fluid)\".\n\n*Create the App.\n\n\nOptional but handy\n\n\n*Start the app \"Notes (Fluid)\" and open its Preferences.\n\n*Under \"General\" change the App icon: browse for some image, or better, just select the built-in Notes App.\n\n*Under \"Behavior\" ensure \"only hides the windows\" is selected.\n\n\nPS:\nYou can use this Fluid App like a browser; thus you can create new tabs to manage a different notes in the same Window.\n\n\n", "Q: Reformat Mac SSD drive so fast - did it really work? I followed the directions here for erasing my 500 GB SSD drive on a MacBook Pro:\nHow to reinstall macOS\nI chose the strongest erasing option under the security options. I hit the erase button, and the process took about 3 seconds to complete. I tried again a few times because this seemed way to fast, but got the same result. Is it supposed to be this fast?\n\nA: If the drive in question is an SSD then using the 7-pass erase option will not function the same way as on an HDD. On an HDD data is written by using a tiny, and very powerful magnet to flip the magnetic field's direction all over different parts of the disk, and smaller magnetic fields sometimes called \"Ghosts\" will be left after writing new data to the drive, allowing old data to be recovered by looking at what direction the magnetic field used to flow in. For this reason the 7-pass erase flips the field of the entire drive to the down position (or \"0\") from beginning to end 7 times in a row, to get rid of any lingering Ghosts. Plus on an HDD files are usually stored as a single stream of data, or in large chunks in only a couple of different places on the drive.\nHowever, and SSD writes data by running a lot of electricity through narrow canals, causing the metal to heat up until the \"bit\" begins to melt. To stop all this excess heat from killing the drive an SSD writes each file in teeny-tiny chunks, scattered all over different parts of the drive, usually in a very random looking way. Since none of the files are actually intact as a single stream of data the way they are on HDDs, the only thing that allows the computer to figure out what files any of those tiny chunks of data belong to is the Partition Map, which is a record of where on the drive all the parts of a file are.\nBasically, when you erase an SSD the only part of the drive that actually gets erased is the Partition Map, because without it to tell the computer where all the different parts of a file are the entire drive looks like a garbled mess of gibberish to the computer. This is why it takes so little time for your drive to secure erase 7 times over, the only part getting erased is that record of where files are, not the files themselves. Since that record is only a few hundred megabytes it only takes about as long to wipe it once as it would to copy a few hundred megabyte large file to another folder.\nIn the end you should also be careful when using multi-pass erase methods on an SSD, because the excess heat re-writing the same part of the drive that many times creates could be enough to damage it.\n\nA: If the drive is hardware encryped, you can render all content inaccessable just by changing the encryption key on the drive. This would take only seconds.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-based_full_disk_encryption (see \"Disk sanitization\" section.)\nNote - the data is still there, it is just impossible* to decipher.\n* OK, extremely improbable... but that's a cryptography question.\n\nA: \nI chose the strongest erasing option under the security options.\n\nIf you are erasing an SSD, there's no need to use any software based secure erase methods.\n\nWhen an ATA Secure Erase (SE) command is issued against a SSD's built-in controller That properly supports it, the SSD controller resets all its storage cells as empty (releasing stored electrons) - just THUS restoring the SSD to factory default settings and write performance. When Implemented properly, SE will process all regions Including the protected storage service regions of the half. 1\n\nIn another answer regarding SSD data recovery I write about the different methodologies used to erase data from an SSD.  In short, there are two different methods for erasing data from modern SSDs:\n\n\n*\n\n*DRAT - All read commands after an erase command will return the same data\n\n*RZAT - All read commands after an erase command will return zeros\n\n\n\n...if the SSD has only DRAT capability, there is the possibility of recovering data, but it's usually in a situation where you were able to stop the deletion process and immediately start data recovery. If it implement RZAT, you can be pretty sure the recovery will only get zeros back unless they take it (along with a court order) back to the manufacturer to get a low level recovery.\n\nIn another answer (SRM gone in macOS Sierra), I detail why srm (secure remove) is no longer an option in Sierra \n\nOn an SSD, unlike a HDD, a TRIM command is sent to wipe any data in\n  that marked space. This allows your SSD to be able to write data to\n  that marked space as if it was brand new and never used, and skip the\n  traditional deletion process.\n\nHow fast to erase your SSD?\n\nI hit the erase button, and the process took about 3 seconds to\n  complete.... Is it supposed to be this fast?\n\nYes. \nIn a very simplistic way to describe the erase process, when you issue a secure erase command (and your SSD properly implements it), it's not going to write and overwrite each sector as it were magnetic; it's going to \"release the stored electrons\" (as Kingston describes) and mark the space as \"new and ready for use.\"  If it employs RZAT, any read request to an address will return zeros.\nI don't know of anyone who has timed the erase process of SSD; normally they test things like iops.  However I do know that my 1TB SSD took less than 10 seconds to partition and setup (my first reaction was \"damm that was fast\").  However, as supporting documentation, from an article on Windows SSD performance2 I was able to grab this little gem:\n\nIn the article, they use Linux to force secure erase a 512GB Crucial SSD prior to installing it in a Windows machine; it did it in 9 seconds.\nTL;DR\nYour erase went fine, it's secure, and you have nothing to worry about that it did it so quickly. A secure erase command marks all data cells as \"new, non active\" almost instantaneously.  Doing multi-pass writes to securely erase data puts undue wear on your SSD while giving you no benefit.  \n\n1 Kingston.com:  SSD Data Wiping: Sanitize or Secure Erase SSDs?\n2 Ultimate Windows SSD Performance Installation Guide\n\nA: If the SSD secure formatting does not satisfy your confidence, then fall back on the old fashioned way: Fill the drive with other stuff. \nThe closer this content is to \"noise\" the better.  Compressed content is very close to noise, so any format that uses data compression will be fine - Any of the video formats, JPEG pictures, compressed audio formats, etc.  \nIt doesn't matter if the format is lossless, as long as it is compressed.  You can tell a compressed format because if you ZIP it, it doesn't get any smaller.   \n", "Q: `dd`command: ISO to USB Changes Partition Table to APM I am trying to dd an ISO to a USB so I can install Linux on another computer, but the USB changes from any partition table (GPM or MBR) to APM when it finishes.\nI'm using the following command:\nsudo dd if=[path of iso] of=/dev/disk2\n\nThe command \"diskutil list\" successfully shows the usb is /dev/disk2 and Disk Utility shows the partition table before has changed to APM.\nI've worked with dd and Disk Utility several times in the past and have never until now had this problem.

I've noticed that iPhones sometimes don't show the battery usage by app in Settings > Battery. The iPhones are otherwise working perfectly fine.  I'm seeing this happening in iPhone 6 and 5s at least.  The iPhone has not been erased or restored yet it sometimes doesn't show this information sometimes.  The next day you check and it shows the usage for the last seven days, then another moment it shows nothing.  The iPhones have lots of free storage space. There're no panics reported in Settings > Privacy > analytic data.  This happens regardless of having just restarted the iPhone or not.  Why does the iPhone have these memory losses?\n\nA: Power usage logs are a low priority item and if that subsystem crashes or the device runs low on space, I've seen it nor populate until a restart. If you restart and the battery isn't 100% - that also suppresses the usage.\nIn dire cases - a backup and restore is needed to remedy the software and filesystem issues that could cause this function to not work at all.\n", "Q: Do adapters exist to install generic SSDs in MacBook Airs? I have a rescued mid-2013 11 inch MacBook Air working great off external USB 3 hard drive but missing its internal SSD.\nThey use a custom SSD, which seem to be expensive even used and aftermarket.\nAre any adaptors available to install a generic SSD?\nI Googled and thought I found that they do now exist, but then I realized the ones I found were the opposite, for using the SSDs from various MacBooks in other laptops etc.\n\nA: The air has no extra room for internal parts. \nUnless the “generic SSD” is substantially smaller than the apple part, there would be no room for it. The adapter of choice would be an external adapter if you’re looking to cut costs. \nExternal connection also simplifies things like whether the storage interface and firmware and controller are compatible. \n\nA: See this question: Do MacBooks support NVMe SSD drives via the use of a Sintech adapter?.\nThere is the Sintech adapter. It is not compatible with NVMe drives on your Mid-2013 MacBook Air, but you can use AHCI drives. They are a bit cheaper than official \"Apple\" drives ($0.66/GB against $0.86/GB for the cheapest drives).\n", "Q: Brand new hard drive encryption taking too long on time machine I have a brand new hard drive with nothing on it. I also bought a brand new external hard drive to use with my MacBook Pro. I'm in the process of backing up to time machine and the encryption is taking forever. Why is it taking so long when there's nothing on my hard drive?\n\nA: The amount of time it takes to encrypt a drive is a function of its size, not its contents.\nYour brand-new hard drive full of zeroes still needs to be scrambled so that no one can figure out that it’s full of zeroes. That will take just as long as encrypting the same amount of arbitrary values.\n\nA: if you don't want your whole hard drive encrypted you can partition it (splits your drive into another segment of the size you wish) and then just backup to that. This will limit backup size though.\n", "Q: iMac doesn't wake from sleep via USB devices I have an iMac here which does not wake from sleep when I press keyboard buttons or click the mouse button.

I've just written up instructions for my Mum on how to use the AppleTV but I'm scared she's going to accidentally delete the contents of the note. Is it not possible to share a note \"read only\"? \nThere's a label saying \"People you invite can make changes\" but there seems to be no way to edit the permissions before inviting. \nMaybe this is coming in iOS 11?\n\nA: I know this isn't really how you're wanting to solve this, but you could simply compose a note with the desired content, and then either screen cap it or print to pdf and insert the screen cap or pdf back into a shared note, presuming you wanted to keep this content within the notes app.\n\nA: I would recommend Pages for doing this.

No direct application's replacement was announced by Apple, but some features (stabilize and optical flow estimation, to name a few) are now available in Final Cut Pro X 10.4 and Motion 5.4 in 2018. \nApple Shake was built on 32-bit Carbon API. I surely understand it's not 64-bit Cocoa API, these APIs are different. But Carbon.framework is still included in /System/Library/Frameworks/ in High Sierra, Sierra or El Capitan, and great old apps (such as Shake, Color, Soundtrack Pro) can use it.\nI'm still using Shake in High Sierra launching shake via Terminal app: \n\n\nBut I can't (for obvious reason) launch Shake via clicking its icon in Applications folder:\n \nSo I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What should I do to bypass this OS limitation and to make Shake run after clicking its icon in Applications folder or on Dock?\n\n*If the first is impossible, how to get rid of white crossed-out circle overlay on Shake's icon (regular icon replacement isn't working in this case)?\nP.S.\nI FOUND POSSIBLE SOLUTION (thanks to Thomas Voßen): Shake on Mac OS X 10.11.6\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a duplicate of Shake.\n\n*Select \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*Go to the \"Contents\" folder and open Info.plist. Xcode has a plist editor.\n\n*Edit the entry com.apple.shake and change it to something like com.apple.shake4.\n\n*Save the plist file.\n\n\nNow it's possible to start Shake with a double click from the Finder in High Sierra 10.13.5.\nBut there's no Info.plist file in Contents folder.\n\nA: Your question answers itself.\n\nApple Shake was built on 32-bit Carbon API. I surely understand it's not 64-bit Cocoa API\n\nLeaving aside the 32 bit versus 64 bit argument; Cocoa is entirely different than Carbon.  It's not going to run because the APIs that Shake is referring to (Carbon) are not compatible with what you are running now (Cocoa).\nIt's important to note that Carbon was deprecated in 2012 with the release of Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.x).  Remember, why and when Apple adds/removes features is entirely their prerogative.\n\nIn 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, most Carbon APIs were considered deprecated. The APIs are still accessible to developers and all Carbon applications will run, but the APIs will no longer be updated.\n\nAs for Shake running in Terminal, this is an entirely different scenario - Cocoa and Carbon do not come into play - it's strictly a text based interface.\nUPDATE:  After a bit of research, I discovered two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shake has been relegated to \"incompatible software\" and Finder will not launch it.  Period.\n\n*There's a workaround (see below) to get it functional in El Capitan because the Carbon libraries are still included, though deprecated.  Note:  This has not been tested/confirmed in Sierra/High Sierra.  As this is deemed \"Incompatible Software\" by Apple, there's no guarantee that the workaround will fully work or for how long.  YMMV.\nWork Around\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click Shake.App \n\n*Go to Show Package Contents. \n\n*Go to Contents --> MacOS --> shake (select shake not tshake);\n\n*Double-click shake. It should first open a Terminal Window and then Shake should be running.\n\n*Create an alias (a shortcut) of the file and place it whenever you want. Launchpad will not be able to see it, though you can have the shortcut/alias in your Applications folder.\n\n\nA: This is me thinking out aloud, so to speak, but one thing also worth trying is to use either AppleScript or Automator to create an application to do what you're now doing manually via Terminal. Once you've done that, adding the application to your Applications folder will make it available to Launchpad, the Dock, etc.\nI'm not sure how familiar you are with either AppleScript or Automator, but using Automator as an example the process would broadly be along these lines:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator (usually found within your Applications folder)\n\n*Go to File > New\n\n*Select Application and click Choose.\n\n*Above the second column (more on the lefthand side) you'll see a search field at the top of a long list\n\n*Type \"Run\" in the field to filter the list\n\n*One of the options will be Run Shell Script\n\n*Double-click on this option\n\n*This will add the Run Shell Script window on the right.\n\n*Now configure and enter the script you need to replicate what you're already doing\n\n*Go to File > Save (or use commandS) to save this as an application\n\n\nNow you should be able to double-click on the application you've created to launch Shake. You can also change the application's icon to whatever you want, add it to the Dock, etc. This will also be available in Launchpad.\nNOTE: - I'm not sure if I've still got Shake installed on one of my Macs, so I haven't tested this to make sure it'll work with Shake specifically, but in theory it should be fine based on what you're already doing.\n\nA: It works in macOS 10.13.5 High Sierra. I've made an Info.plist and added these lines to it: \n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>\n    <string>Shake</string>\n    <key>CFBundleGetInfoString</key>\n    <string>Shake version 4.1.1</string>\n    <key>CFBundleIconFile</key>\n    <string>Shake</string>\n    <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>\n    <string>com.apple.shake4</string>\n    <key>CFBundleName</key>\n    <string>Shake</string>\n    <key>CFBundlePackageType</key>\n    <string>APPL</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nCarbon API, as well as Cocoa API, is tightly integrated with low-level Core Foundation API (CF).\nHere's useful information about Bundles in macOS and iOS:\nBundle Programming Guide – About Bundles\nBundle Programming Guide – Bundle Structures\nNow, clicking Shake's icon on Dock I can launch Shake in High Sierra's GUI.\n\nI can run it not only from Launchpad but also via Terminal as well. It simultaneously allows me to run multiple instances of Shake.\n\n", "Q: How to restore a backup to iPhone 6s using out of date iTunes/OS X? My iPhone 6 was stolen and I had only backed up to iTunes, not iCloud.  But the company can only supply me with an iPhone 6s, which can't connect to be out of date iTunes (11.4) and OS X (10.7.5).  \nThis means I cannot reach the backup of my iPhone 6 within iTunes.  \nAny suggestions for how to bypass this issue and reach the backup in order to recover my data?\n\nA: Are you able to borrow a friend or family member's computer to connect and restore the backup? If so, here's the instructions to get to your backup, and copy it elsewhere (it's ok to copy it to a Windows computer to restore as well):\n\n\n*\n\n*In iTunes, go to the iTunes Preferences and then the Devices tab.\n\n*Right click on your backup and select \"Reveal in Finder\" (it may be that or \"Show in Finder\". I don't remember what version that text changed ;))\n\n*iTunes will open the ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup folder. Each folder in here is an individual iOS backup named by the device UDID (making it a long folder name), and the Show in Finder should have highlighted your specific backup. Copy that folder to your USB thumb drive or whatever you're using to copy.\nWe'll need to copy that folder on to the other computer into the appropriate spot for iTunes to pick it up, so here are the instructions for Windows and Mac to get to that MobileSync > Backup folder.\nWindows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 8 and 10: In the search bar type %appdata% (with the percents) and press return/enter. A file browser window will open to the user's Application Data folder.\n\n*Windows 7, Vista, XP: From the start menu, select Run. In the run box, type %appdata% (with the percents) and press return/enter. A file browser window will open to the user's Application Data folder.\n\n*From there, navigate to Apple Computer >  MobileSync > Backup.\nMac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder, and select the \"Go\" menu at the top of the screen. Hold the Option key, and select the \"Library\" menu option from the Go menu. (On OSX Lion and above, Library will only appear with the Option key held.)\n\n*From Library, navigate to Application Support > MobileSync > Backup.\nYou'll want to copy the folder for your backup into the Backup folder, so the folder is sitting next to any other backups already on the system, very similar to how you found it on your mac.\n", "Q: Searches in Safari and possible virus Warning, a virus?\nI have made a search in Safari address bar.

Or is it an iPhone 7 and above exclusive feature? \n\nA: Hardware encode for HEIF requires an A10 chip, and thus is only supported on iPhone 7 and newer. This is why you don’t see the option to save as HEIF on your iPhone 6:\n\nHardware decode support starts with iPhone 6s and iPhone SE:\n\nFor iOS, we have hardware decode on the minimum config of the A9 chip.\n\n\nIntroducing HEIF and HEVC - WWDC 2017\nHowever since all Apple devices will support at least software decode, you will be able to share HEIF images natively (by iMessage, or any other sharing service that negotiates decode capabilities) with all Apple devices.\n", "Q: Deleting photos from my iPhone - and keeping them in iCloud I had the Apple Helpdesk helping me to delete all the photos I had on my iPhone.\nI had to go to Settings and switch off the iCloud Photo Library and my Photo Stream.\nWell, I thought that would work but it only deleted 1/2 of the photos. I still have 17,111 photos on it.\nThe question now is: how do I get the rest off? I tried to delete some, but then I get the notification that the photos will be deleted from all my devices.\nWhat to do?\n\nA: I’ve experienced something similar and I always suspected that they were the photos on the phone before iCloud Photo Library was enabled. The only way I know to delete them is manually or through a manual sync on my Mac using Image Capture which gives you the option to delete all the photos copied to the Mac. Note that I’m syncing to a folder on the Mac, not to Photos.\nI’m not sure what’s supposed to happen but I was trying to force my iPhone to only have optimized copies, so I turned off iCloud Photo Library, deleted the photos that remained, and then turned iCloud Photo Library back on. Photos proceeded to delete all the photos I’d manually deleted from my iPhone from iCloud Photo Library. That was unexpected but not a huge crisis because I restored them from “Recently Deleted”. However, I did learn not to assume I understood iCloud Photo Library well enough to think I could bend it to my will.\nAfter those experiences, if I wanted to take a device completely out of iCloud Photo Library, I’d erase it and rebuild it form scratch rather than a backup. Painful but the only way to be sure.\n", "Q: Sync music from iPod classic to iTunes? My Father's iPod (classic) has all of his music arranged and named perfectly.\nHowever, his iTunes is not in sync with his iPod, as his computer hard drive was damaged, and all of his iTunes data lost. Because of this, we have not been able to back up the iPod, and if it is damaged, he will have to rename thousands of songs again.\nIs there a way to sync the music from his iPod to his iTunes, or any other possible way to backup the iPod data?\n\nA: Not officially.  Syncing is intended to go in one direction:  from iTunes to iPod.  \nThat said, there are some third-party apps that will permit this.\nhttps://tunesgo.wondershare.com/music-transfer/transfer-music-from-ipod-touch-to-computer.html\nGood discussion on Apple Support:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3991\n\nA: iMazing has worked really well for me.\nhttps://imazing.com/transfer-all-data-to-any-other-iphone-or-ipad\n\nA: To add files from iPod classic back to iTunes, go through following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPod to Mac (or PC) and Open iTunes.\n\n*Pick menu \"File -> Add to Library...\" (or press cmd+o).\n\n*In Open dialogue, navigate to your iPod Classic. It should be displayed as an external drive.\n\n*Select folder iPod_Control/Music and click \"Open\" button.

I use a mid-13 13-inches Retina MBP 256gb with macOS Sierra 10.12.2.\nI recently decided to securely erase free space using the following terminal command:\ndiskutil secureErase freespace 1 /Volumes/HD\n\nAfter completing its task, I got 50GB of free space instead of the 80GB I had before the operation. \nCould it be a remaining temporary file used by secureErase?\n\nA: That's it. Do you have external SSD and FileVault enabled? Having SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space commands aren't needed for SSD drives 'cause a regular erase command makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD.\nAlso, if you don’t include freespace word, diskutil will start securely erasing the entire disk, instead of just the free space! 1 means single-pass method run of random numbers. \ndiskutil secureErase freespace 1 /Volumes/SSD\n\nBe careful with it.

Is there, e.g., a file where iTerm2 backs up session output? Or any other way to read the content of an open window? Obviously it's too late to select any specific session logging options. Usually after a forced restart, the iTerm2 window will restore the previous output so I presume it is saved somewhere.\n\nA: You can now do automated session logging in iTerm.

Will that delete the data currently on my iPhone, or does my data get added to what’s in the backup?\n\nA: Restoring an iPhone from backup will wipe all its contents, then replace everything with what’s in the backup.\nWhatever data is on your iPhone now, but not in the backup, will be GONE after the restoration process.\n\nA: I would say, you can’t restore a device until you erase the iPhone so the restore doesn’t really erase anything - just that you have to pass through erase to get to restore in the first place.\nSo I realize my argument is close to \"splitting hairs\", but I'd say: Restoring a backup implies everything is erased from the phone - you can’t mix a current set of data with a restore\n\nA: I just did a restore and the data saved in the file sharing section of the applications was not removed so the accepted answer is wrong. It might have deleted the data if the app didn't exist before but I didn't try. The software version was not changed. As far as I can tell it just reset a bunch of settings. \n\nA: When you restore your iPhone, whether it's from backup or as a \"new\" iPhone, all data on the phone since the last backup that was created will be erased (gone). \nIf you want to restore your iPhone from backup, the best thing to do is take a backup first using either iCloud backup or through iTunes, then perform the restore process.\nOnce the phone goes through the setup screen, you can restore from backup or start fresh.\n\nA: When you recover your iPhone data by using iTunes backups, your current iPhone data will be synced with iTunes backup files.

Otherwise you can try to reinstall macOS through the recovery if your MacBook Pro supports Sierra.\n\nA: If you have ever purchased a software version you can get a copy from the App Store.  go to App Store and click on 'Purchased'. Any versions of software that you bought, or maybe just downloaded, will appear in the list. You can then download an installer for that version.\nIf you haven't downloaded any previous versions you can buy some older versions from Apple.

If charged however, everything is normal. What is going on? I've been trying to calibrate my battery after enabling the battery meter by editing a .plist file in a copy of my iPod's backup. I restored that backup to my iPod, and the battery meter worked just fine. The iPod is running iOS 4.2.1.\nHowever, attempts at calibrating it do not work. It will shut off after reaching \"0%\", but if I hold the power button, it just boots back into iOS with ~19% remaining. \nI let it drain after that, and if I hold the power button again after it shuts off, guess what? It's back at ~19%.\nI repeat this one more time before it refuses to boot into iOS. Once it drains the third time, it will boot into the Apple logo, then shut off after ~15 seconds. If I continue attempts to boot, it will continue doing this.\nIf I plug it into a charger though, it will boot into iOS and claim that it has 3% remaining and is charging.

I don't think you'll get a satisfactory conclusion to your quest -- it may simply be an unusual set of circumstances that is leading to what you are seeing. Lastly - it doesn't seem as if the 2nd Gen is malfunctioning in any other way.

I have lots of Mini Displayport dongles I would still like to use.\nFor example look at the product description in these two links:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C316EIK\n\nTHUNDERBOLT 3 PORT COMPATIBLE with the reversible USB-C connecter that connects to new computers and tablets > with Thunderbolt 3 such as the 2016 MacBook Pro (NOT 2017 iMac or MacBook)\n\n\n*https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2ORP84\n\nNOTICE: the firmware of our products is updating now, please don’t connect this product to iMac 2017 and > MacBook 2017. USB TYPE C to Mini DisplayPort (Mini DP, MDP) adapter connects a computer host with a USB > Type-C port to a monitor or projector with Mini DisplayPort input, ★NOTICE★: DO NOT connect adapter(like mini > dp to DVI adapter) from other brand to USB-C to mini displayport adapter for a second signal convert, we > can't guarantee it works well.\n\nEDIT:\nFound a link with as a reference for the answer:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/3200052/displays/apples-thunderbolt-display-doesnt-work-with-a-12-inch-macbooks-usb-c-port.html\n\nA: You gotta love the heightened level of complexity that simplifying things down to one connector has made things.  Let's sort it out....\n\n\n*\n\n*USB-C is the connector type.  It's the physical interface specification just as USB-A, USB-B, USB-Micro, USB-Mini are all physical connectors.  It's not a USB port, nor is it a Thunderbolt port.  \n\n*USB 3.0/3.1 is the USB specification and port type.  It sets the standard for how USB will communicate on your machine.  It's backward compatible with USB 2.0, 1.1, and 1.0\n\n*Thunderbolt 3 is the Thunderbolt specification that supplies DisplayPort, PCIe, USB 3.0 and power.  It's backward compatible with Thunderbolt 2 and 1.  Thunderbolt 3 utilizes the USB-C interface and Thunderbolt 1/2 utilize a mini DisplayPort interface connector.\n\n*Daisy Chaining - Thunderbolt can be daisy chained, while DisplayPort cannot.  Usually, displays are last in the Thunderbolt chain.\nAs for the Macs...\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pros from 2016 onward have 2 or 4 Thunderbolt ports that utilize USB-C interfaces\n\n*MacBooks have USB 3.1 ports with DisplayPort support that utilize USB-C interfaces.\nSo, when you are picking your adapter, you have to determine what port you have on your machine first.  Then you pick the physical inteface type that works for you.  \nFor example if you have a MacBook, you will have a USB port with DisplayPort support on a USB-C interface.  This means you can use a USB to DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort adapter or you can use a USB-C DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable.  What you can't use is a Thunderbolt cable/adapter\nIf you have a MacBook, you have a few more options because of the inclusion of Thunderbolt. \nAs for the iMac... Thunderbolt is Thunderbolt.  It doesn't change from MacBook to iMac to PC.  A Thunderbolt adapter for the MacBook Pro will work on an iMac because, after all, an iMac is a MacBook Pro in a different form factor.\n", "Q: Ext4fuse usage to see and browse the volume in Finder I want to copy some files of my old encrypted SSD with ubuntu. \nI installed ext4fuse and done sudo ext4fuse /dev/disk3s1  /Volumes/Linux, although I don't know if it is the right partition number (where can I see them in Disk Utility?). \nHow do I open then the disk in Finder?

I want to buy the new macbook pro 13\" without touchbar and be able to connect two 4k monitors AND the charger. But this macbook only has 2 ports.\n\nA: What you want to do is possible, but not without either using an adapter, dock, or the right kind of displays. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can use a display that allows you to daisy-chain to another display (i.e. you have a charger plugged into one of your ports, and you have one display connected to the other port and a second display connected to the first display)\n\n*you purchase a dock such as the OWC's Thunderbolt 3 Dock.\n\n*you purchase at least one display that will provide charging power to your MBP (e.g. the LG UltraFine 4K Display).\n\n\nYou may want to also read:\n\n\n*\n\n*About Thunderbolt ports and displays\n\n*Connect with Thunderbolt 3 on your new MacBook Pro\n\n*Use the LG UltraFine 4K Display with your Mac\nNOTE: IMHO, if you're wanting to run two 4K displays you probably should invest in a MBP with four Thunderbolt ports, as this is likely to provide more flexibility in terms of usage and the variety of devices you can purchase to meet your needs.\n\nA: Here's a cheap solution - for the 2nd display, use a mini-displayport to USB-C adapter that also has power-input. Something like this - https://www.amazon.com/Paheven-Display-JellyFish-Mini-DisplayPort-Charging/dp/B079CBNK8M/\n", "Q: What's making this sound on my mac? A few months ago, my laptop started playing a strange sound alert, but it's not from anything I recognise. There is no visual clue as to what it's related to. Just the sound plays, most commonly when I've just woken my laptop back up from having the lid closed, but also at other random times if I've been working on my laptop for a while. I'm worried it's some sort of monitoring or capturing app, but it perhaps wouldn't make sense for this type of program to have a sound alert. I just want to be able to stop it. I've gone into Activity Monitor, but can't seem to trace it from there. I've uploaded the sound file here if anybody recognises it: http://www.occupied.com.au/weirdsound.aif\n\nA: That's the \"new email\" sound for Spark, Readdle's Mac mail client. A rather unique characteristic of Spark is that it will continue to send you notifications—audio and all—even when the app is not open. Even if you haven't seen any visible notifications, it's entirely possible that you've configured your Notifications preferences to hide them, but still play the sounds (check System Preferences > Notifications > Spark)—an example of such a configuration is shown below:\n\nAs Spark is exclusively a Mac App Store app, you can easily uninstall it from Launchpad (open Launchpad, click and hold on Spark, then click the x button that appears on Spark's icon). Once the app is uninstalled, it can no longer send you notifications.\n", "Q: Considerations for granting read and write privileges to MacHD for \"everyone\"? What are the potential dangers to be wary of when changing the root drives read/write permission? Specifically, granting \"everyone\" read/write access?  \n\nE.g. will I be opening up my computer to potential malware attacks/viruses and such? Will I be compromising my system integrity? Will it be easier for me to catastrophically damage or erase my entire system? Am I just being paranoid?\nUse case: I've recently installed Avid's Media Composer | First and while I can use external drives (and likely a partition of my internal SSD), as is I am unable to use the internal drive for writing media files (like renders and when ingesting files.) Of note, I can \"link\" to files just fine, but importing to Avid codecs requires a drive the app can write to. When I launch the application without any external drives mounted, I get this warning: \n\nPer the Avid Knowledge Base a solution involves changing the write protection for the drive's root folder so as to allow Media Composer | First to create and populate its \"Avid Media Files\" folder: \n\nSolution:\nIf you do need to use the system drive as a media drive, take the following steps to change permissions\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click on your system (Macintosh HD in most cases) drive to highlight\n  \n*From the File menu select Get Info (cmd+I)\n  \n*Click the lock icon in the bottom right to make changes\n  \n*Click on the “Read only” text in the Privilege column next to Everyone and set the privilege to “Read & Write”\n  You should now be able to see the system drive as a valid media drive.\n  \n  \n  Note: If you repair permissions on the system drive, they will reset and you will have to repeat this procedure.\n\nFor whatever it is worth, I am the only user of this particular computer and I do have it backed up regularly with Time Machine. Partly I am asking for my own understanding, but also, if I were trying to set up a family member with this free editing software and they also let their kids use the laptop, it seems like granting everyone read/write might be make for more of a potential problem or accidents? Am I being overly cautious, or perhaps, by making the change, eagerly risky?\n\nA: \"Everyone\" means all users, so yes, there is a risk, but only if someone already got into your system, and at that point they might already be brute-forcing your root password(when they've got it they're almost unstoppable). So as long as nothing bad gets into your system everything's fine and opening up your hard drive for everyone to edit doesn't rise the risk of that happening.\n", "Q: Restrict size of TimeMachine backups I have an external 2TGB HD which I use as a TimeMachine backup.\nThis developed problems and could not be repaired.\n\nRepairing file system.\nChecking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\nDetected a case-sensitive volume.\nChecking extents overflow file.\nChecking catalog file.\nInvalid index key\nIncorrect block count for file permStore\n(It should be 17 instead of 0)\nIncorrect block count for file shutdown_time\n(It should be 1 instead of 0)\nRebuilding catalog B-tree.\nDisk full error\nThe volume Time Machine Backups could not be repaired.\n\nI bought a new 3TB disc, created a 2TB partition, and attempted to copy Backups.backupdb.\nFinder spent 24 hours \"Preparing to copy\"; then failed due to lack of space!\nI reformatted and created a 2.5TB partition, Finder has spent 24 hours \"Preparing to copy\" and is now copying files.\n\nI really don't need all the backups (which go back to 2012) and I don't want TimeMachine to use all the space on my new drive.

This informed me it was making a new backup, and proceeded to copy 350GiB of data.\nThis was not quite as I hoped. Inspection of the file system indicated that none of the files were hard linked into the old backups.\nAs far as Time Machine is concerned, all my backups are there, and sample checks indicate all files seem OK.\nSubsequent backups appear to working as normal, files are hard linked into the initial backup.\nI did some pruning of earlier backups with tmutil delete, but it is obvious I am only going to get back to a 2TiB image with serious pruning.\nI did toy with the idea of trying to combine the hard links, but decided I will leave the disk as is, and just accept that I now have a 3TiB Time Machine.\nAt least I do have all my historical backups if I need them .\n\nA: This worked in pre-Sierra you might want to try it.  This will set the value to 1TB.  You specify the integer value in megabytes.    \nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine MaxSize -integer 1000000\n\nA: You might consider the fact that Time Machine backs up your system every hour. You problem may not be related to the size of the backups but to the number of backups. There is a 3rd party app named TimeMachineEditor that lets you back up every x hours, daily, weekly or monthly. You need to determine which backup frequency is best for you. The app is located here and its free and simple to use\n", "Q: \"The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk\" error in bootcamp macOS Sierra Problem: \nI can no longer boot Boot Camp partition (BCP) running Windows 10 Pro 1703.

I'm on my sixth Mac since purchasing my first in 2006. I've used Migration Assistant on every upgrade. In between upgrades, I've installed and removed lots of programs, changed lots settings, added and removed stuff all over the file structure while programming and on other spelunking excursions.  My Mac still runs fine, but I suspect it may be a little disheveled. What's the best practice with Migration Assistance in cases like this?\n\nA: You may get a lot of opinions about this but I have been migrating from one Mac to another since the original Mac O/S public beta with nary a problem.\nOn occasion I will make a quick pass through the root and user level Application Support folders and remove anything associated with an app I know has been removed. Same with the Preferences folder (both User and Root).\nUtilities that show you file sizes so you can find disk space wasters are handy here as are utilities like CleanMyMac or Onyx to get rid of cache and other temporary files.\nBut my days of poring through the file system for stray files ended when I had more disk space on my Macs that I could ever possibly use, so I don't sweat the small stuff. Much of it takes up very little space and I have better things to do than manually remove a thousand (or more) preference/settings/support files.\nIf you have a Mac with limited disk space that may not apply.

Also, the green LED just blinks randomly.\nShould I get a new charger or something can be done to existing one?\n\nA: Is your MacBook charging up properly when you are using it with the charger plugged in?\nIt might only be drawing 12W of power because your batteries are fully charged and the 12W is only used for your current operation.\nHaving a charger capable of giving 60W does not mean your MacBook will always require 60W from it.\nFor example, my MacBook Pro is currently drawing 20.31 V from the power adapter right now.\n\n\nA: \nGreen LED just blinks randomly.\n\nThis is most likely an issue with the DC-In or your logic board.\nThis is an error condition caused by a fault that is detected between your MagSafe and the power circuitry.  There's a small possibility that the issue is your charger, but it's highly unlikely.  The easiest way to test is to take your MacBook to Apple and hook up one of their chargers - if the blinking persists, it's your DC-in board or your logic board.\nIf it's your DC-in board, the procedure to fix is is pretty easy and is a DIY.  Depending on the model of your Mac, the DC-in board may be integrated into the logic board itself; which means you will have to take it in for service. \nIf happens to be your charger, then you will need to replace it with another - there are no user serviceable components.

I want the option to \"send as sms when imessage is unavailable\" to turn off. But if it's on, does that mean it sends as SMS when imessage is unavailable on MY end (the sending end), the receiving end, or both? Example: while I had this option on, if I texted a friend whose phone was on airplane mode or off, it would go through as sms and not imessage. With this option off, if I imessage someone and their phone is on airplane mode/off, would it send as SMS because imessage is available on my end? Or keep it as an undelivered imessage because imessage is unavailable on their end?? \n\nA: The option to \"send as sms when imessage is unavailable\" refers to the sender side, meaning that if the sender is not connected to iMessage (i.e. offline), the message will be sent to the receiver as a SMS.\nExample:\nSender is not connected to the internet / have bad internet connection and cannot connect to iMessage server, then their message sending to a registered iMessage receiver will be sent as SMS instead.\niMessage will not be used at all if the receiver is not an iMessage user.\niMessage will be sent if the sender has connection to iMessage server but the receiver does not have connection to iMessage. The receiver will receive the message the next time they connect to the iMessage server (when their connection is back).\n\nA: This option means when a user with iMessage doesn't have an Internet connection or iMessage is disabled.\nFor example:\nOne day while chatting with a friend via iMessage your friend goes into a tunel and disconnects from the Internet, your iPhone detects that your friend is off-line. If the option \"send as SMS when iMessage is unavailable\" is enabled, \nthe messsage will be send as an SMS.

But I do not want another app in Overlay \n\n\nOr\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Home screen so no apps in view and then start Notes and it’s full screen but it secretly knows it is an Overlay so workflow is.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Notes full screen\n\n*Dock to select Safari so get Safari in full screen as any other app would do\n\n*Dock to select Mail and glorious full screen Mail appears\n\n*Home button so no apps in view\n\n*Select Notes from Dock to get Notes in full screen\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to do this extra step of going to the Home Screen for Notes (the was used in Overlay mode and ios11 is stubbornly not letting go) because if an another app is full screen then Notes will come back as Overlay. For clarity any other apps you could switch to using the Dock would be full screen so yuck for this\n\n\n\n\nOr (homing in)\n\n\n*\n\n*Annoyingly you have to have started Notes once in full screen mode to use this slight improvement as you bizarrely need that step to get the Overlay app to appear in the multi-tasking view so follow above to get that.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Use can then use the multitask control panel. \n\n*Swipe up to middle of screen and switch to Notes using this makes Notes full screen and as long as you switch via this back to Notes it is always full screen. \n\n*So any other app you can switch anyway you want but always use the control panel to switch to Notes. Probably the most doable solution until you get an app to replace Notes in Overlay.\n\n\n\nBut one more I found\n\n\n*\n\n*Kill Notes and start from Home Screen\n\n\n*\n\n*swipe up to middle of screen to get the multi-tasking panel.\n\n*swipe up on Notes to kill it. As before for Notes to appear you needed to do the start Notes with no other app in view at least once.\n\n*Now crucially go to Home Screen so no app on view\n\n*Start Notes and it will be full screen\n\n*You can now switch as if it was never an Overlay\n\n\n\nIf you do the above but having killed Notes then go back to an app (Safari) and select Notes from the Dock then not only does it stubbornly start in Overlay mode but it also again does not appear as an app in the multi-tasking view.\nI would like a list of apps in Overlay so I can switch between them. A clever version of the list we used to have and then swiping an app out of that list could be used to remove from a Overlay. At the very least it seems a bit of a bug that an Overlay app doesn’t appear in the multi-tasking panel until you started as view screen using hack above.\n\nA: The solution that seem to be working is actually to go to the home screen and open the app from there.\n\nA: If what the OP means by \"unsnap\" is to dismiss the app, then to dismiss an app that has been pulled up from the dock as an overlay this procedure should work.\nNote: iOS 11 is in Beta as of this writing and could change.\nThere is a 'Handle' on the top of the app.  Tap and hold to swipe the app to the right (off screen) thus dismissing the app.  Notice in the animation below how the horizontal bar or handle at the top lightens as it is tapped for the drag off.\nTo be sure that when opening the formerly overlaid app from the dock is not again an overlay, swipe it to the left side and then pull it down to the left in split view.  Move the separator all the way to dismiss the original app (that was underneath) and now the app will open full screen when opened from the dock or when tapping its icon on the home screen.  See animation below.\n\n\nA: only one app can be in slide over mode at once, so find some other app that you don't need and make it the slide over app\n", "Q: Safari browser support for offline web apps I've been doing research into what solutions are out there for using iOS Safari browsers in terms of offline capabilities with web apps. Many articles and sources I've come across don't seem to mention much in terms of offline support apart from AppCache which is now deprecated. \nI'm wondering if there are any solutions out there for iOS Safari offline support apart from AppCache?\n\nA: iOS Safari doesn't currently support offline browsing for web apps. However, Apple is currently working on improving support for progressive web apps, more importantly Service Workers. \nService Workers power offline functionality, push notifications, background content updating, content caching, and a whole lot more.\nHere is a somewhat recent article on Service Workers\nhttp://appleinsider.com/articles/17/08/05/apple-may-integrate-service-workers-into-webkit-support-next-gen-web-apps-in-safari\n", "Q: Trouble transferring Mail folders to a new Mac I just bought a new Mac.\nI want to transfer everything in my Mail install from my previous Mac to this new one.

From my personal experience, it takes usually about 24 hours to complete, but that's no guarantee.\nFrom the linked page:\n\nExpedited App Review\nIf you face extenuating circumstances, you can request the review of your app to be expedited. These circumstances include fixing a critical bug in your app on the App Store or releasing your app to coincide with an event you are directly associated with.\nUrgent Bug Fix\nIf you've submitted an update to fix a critical bug in your app on the App Store and you are requesting an expedited review, be sure to include the steps to reproduce the bug on the current version of your app.\nTime-Sensitive Event\nFor apps associated with an event, we recommend you plan and schedule the release of your app in iTunes Connect. However, if your app is still in review and the launch of your event is quickly approaching, you can request to have your app review expedited. When submitting your request, it's important to include the event, date of the event, and your app's association with the event.\nPlease Note: Expedited reviews are granted on a limited basis and we cannot guarantee that every request will be expedited.\n\nIt's a (partly) automated process, you can just sign in and request one on the Developer Portal.\n", "Q: TestFlight to App Store transition I just want to know the process from TestFlight to the App Store like\nOnce my app is visible in the TestFlight of iTunes Connect:\n\n\n*\n\n*When and how will it be moved to the App Store for being LIVE?\n\n*Apps, once uploaded, are automatically visible in the TestFlight app, when will this be removed: after 180 days, or 90 days, or when the app is live?\n\n*When does the reviewing process start?

Apple has to review it again (even if you use the same build as for TestFlight) and after approval it will go live.\n\n\n  \n*Apps, once uploaded, are automatically visible in the TestFlight app, when will this be removed: after 180 days, or 90 days, or when the app is live?\n  \n\nThe standard testing period is 90 days, so after that, the app will disappear, but (IIRC) if that version of the app goes live, that ends the availability in TestFlight as well.\n\n\n  \n*When does the reviewing process start? The moment app is uploaded to TestFlight, or when it is promoted by someone for LIVE?\n  \n\nWhen the app is uploaded to TestFlight for an alpha test (by users which also have access to the iTunes Connect backend), no review takes place (except for some automated integrity checks). For a beta test via TestFlight, a short (manual) review is conducted by Apple, but nowhere near as rigorous as for an app going live.

When I'm trying to run terminal commands in recovery mode on my MacBook Pro, most commands just won't work even if I'm root (the last character of the default(PS1) prompt is a '#').\nSo why is this and can I fix it?\n\nA: Terminal only provides a subset of commands while in Recovery mode, but it can't be fixed because that's Apple's design. I've done a little Googling to find out exactly what is disabled, but I found nothing definitive. I can surmise that some commands are disabled because they require certain macOS services which are not running in Recovery mode, as well as a host of kernel extensions not being loaded. The Recovery macOS is clearly a subset of the full macOS.\nI would also surmise that the available commands are the ones only useful (per Apple's wisdom) during a system recovery, such as disabling SIP, disk utility, password resets, etc.\n\nA: The recovery partition is a bare-bones version of macOS which can be used as for various things, such as installing macOS again or disable SIP (system integrity protection). To keep the recovery partition small, Apple decided to not include all CLI tools that are available in macOS.\nFor security reasons, not every user is able to access all files. The root user should be able to access all files and run all programs. It's a permission issue. However, he's not able to run programs that don't even exist on the recovery partition, so changing the user to root won't help you.\nIf you do want to use those programs, you shouldn't be using the recovery partition anyways but boot a standard macOS partition.\n\nA: If you run into the issue again.  Put your MBP into TARGET DISK MODE by holding down T and powering the computer on. Use Firewire to a machine that only needs to be a mac of some sort. When you connect the host computer you will see your MBP show up as an external disk or disks depending on your format.  \nYou can then use the terminal and all of it's full collection of commands, full disk utility and any other repair apps to operate on your MBP while it lays on the operating table in Target Disk. When finished, unlink the Firewire and reboot into Recovery Mode for whatever finishing touches you want to make and or upgrade your system!\n", "Q: iOS - Archive Upload Failed due to error -22421 I am unable to submit an iOS app to the App Store.

I brought an iPhone 6 from Malaysia. One of my friends claim that Malaysia has lame quality and also a material difference. So people like to order only from Europe, because they have best quality, like Germany. He also claim that Germany has the best material. Is it? If so, what is the quality and material difference? \n\nA: There is no difference in quality whatsoever. \nThe only difference is that the actual phone hardware (the small bit that creates a phone connection) will be different to work best in the country where you purchased a phone. A US phone will work with all phone networks in the USA, a German phone will work with all phone networks in Germany, and a Malaysian phone will work with all phone networks in Malaysia. They all will work fine in many other countries as well, but possibly not in all. \nPlus, because the laws in various countries are different, that may cause differences.

Recently I did a clean install of Sierra and I deleted a text file which is under 3MB.I scanned the disk immediately using data recovery software and I was surprised not to find the file there.Is this completely normal or not.\nBefore I did a clean install I did the same thing but the file was still there.\n\nA: The OS, technically, has nothing to do with how fast something gets deleted; it's how quickly your drive implements the \"erase\" ATA command.\nIf you deleted a file by \"moving\" it into your Trash, it will be there until you empty the trash. However, if you deleted the file by using a Terminal command (rm for example), it's gone as you have bypassed the Trash altogether.\nNow, if you are using a hard disk drive, there is a chance of recovery; the sooner you attempt recovery, the better the chances.  However, if you are using a solid state drive (SSD), it's gone for good.  The TRIM command to erase happens almost instantaneously; there's no remnants to recover because the block(s) that your data occupied are immediately marked as \"new and unused\" and the SSD is instructed to return zeros or random values if you attempt to read from it/them.   See this answer for additional details on this process.\n", "Q: On a mac, how can I force-close a window of an app (NOT the app itself)? I'm looking for a keyboard shortcut to close a window of an app, skipping the \"Would you like to save\" pester dialog, while leaving the app, itself, and other windows, still open.\nIf there's no way to do that, is there a keyboard shortcut for hitting a certain button in a window/dialog?  In Windows, this would typically be ALT+[first letter of the button text].\n\nA: To press a button in a dialog using a keyboard shortcut, press Command, followed by the first letter of the action you wish to trigger. The exception to this rule is if the action you wish to activate will delete a file or changes thereto, in which case the shortcut is Command-delete.\nTo force-close a window, you'd need to automate the correct series of key presses using AppleScript or something similar. The first key combination would likely be Command-W (though not even this is entirely universal). However, the dialog shortcuts vary by application—older versions of Microsoft Word don't comply with the Command-delete behavior (they use Command-D), while Automator's save sheets can often only be closed through mouse input. You would have to tailor this behavior to the specific applications in which you're interested. Such an AppleScript might look something like this (though be warned, triggering Command-delete without knowing the context is an easy way to accidentally delete files and large swathes of text):\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"w\" using {command down} -- Command-W\n    delay 0.5 -- Wait for the dialog to appear\n    key code 51 using {command down} -- Command-delete\nend tell\n\nTo tie an AppleScript to a keyboard shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator (Applications > Utilities > Automator) and create a new Service (optionally, configure it just to run in the applications you want).\n\n*Add a \"Run AppleScript\" block in which you write your AppleScript.\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts.\n\n*Create a new shortcut, where the \"Menu Title\" is the title you gave your Service (again, you can tie this shortcut just to the applications to which your Service applies). The keyboard shortcut you enter here is the one you can use to trigger your \"force close\" behavior.\n\n\nYou could create multiple services, each one with the same keyboard shortcut but in different applications, corresponding to the unique behavior of each.\n", "Q: Copying Xcode installation from one Mac to another I have installed 3 different versions of Xcode on my Mac.\nCan I just copy the /Applications/Xcode*.app app bundles from my Mac and put it on other 10 Macs I have?

It looks like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>my.startup</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>sh</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>\n      launchctl setenv FOO foo\n      launchctl setenv BAR bar\n      <!-- ... -->\n      launchctl setenv PATH /usr/local/opt/scala210/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n    </string>\n  </array>\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nFrom my experimenting, it appears that nothing less than a system reboot will make changes to this file take effect.  I did find mentions of this command that will supposedly do the trick:\n$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/environment.plist\n\n...but when I run it I get this response:\n[my home dir]/Library/LaunchAgents/environment.plist: service already loaded\n\nIn the documentation for launchctl I see mention of a -F flag that seems relevant:\nForce the loading or unloading of the plist. Ignore the Disabled key.\n\nHowever, it makes no difference if I include this switch; I get the same output and the file is ignored.\nSo anyway, rebooting does make the changes take effect (maybe logging out and back in also would? I didn't check), but with one exception: the PATH variable.  That variable just stayed the same no matter how I changed it, and across reboots.  Eventually I stumbled across a Stack Exchange answer that offhandedly warned that changing PATH in this way would be ignored until the Dock was restarted with the killall Dock command.  So I did that, and rebooted, and finally I had my PATH set correctly.\nSo, anyway, I suppose my main question would be: Is there any more hassle-free way to update environment variables than the way I outline above?

What is the reason?\n\nA: The reason you're asked to enter password two times may be because FileVault is enabled. When FileVault is enabled, you're first prompted to enter in your login information to unlock the disk at the EFI Login Window, and then you're prompted to enter in your login information again to go into your actual user account. \nRecommended workaround is\n\n\n*\n\n*You turn off FileVault (System Preferences → Security & Privacy → FileVault),  or \n\n*To allow automatic login when FileVault is turned on, enter this on Terminal\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow DisableFDEAutoLogin\n\nPlease refer to this Apple Support Communities thread for more details\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7690125\n", "Q: Mac running slow and some applications don't open in standard mode, but in safe mode it works well I have an issue on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, mid 2010, macOS Sierra).\nSome applications won't open, or don't work as expected, and generally I see the spinning pinwheel and macOS is really slow.\nAlso, often when I shut down I see a black screen, but not completely turned off, so I have to shut down by pressing the power button for 3-4 seconds.\nSometimes applications like Google Chrome or Final Cut Pro don't work well, often freezing up or not opening. \nBut all these issues disappear if I boot up in safe mode (applications work well, restarting and shutdown always work, no frozen apps, etc). \nI tried to: \n\n\n*\n\n*follow the guidelined to isolate the issue on this article: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262 but I don't have any login items.\n\n*create a new user profile, but the issue isn't fixed.\n\n\nMy question is: What differences are there between safe mode and standard mode? What can I disable to isolate the issue?\n\nA: One place to start is testing your Startup/Login items, as it's likely to be something that's getting loaded during normal startup (e.g. a Startup/Login item, a font you've installed, etc) that's causing the problem. \nSo I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup normally\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Take a note of your Login Items \n\n*Now remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the - button below\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n\nNow your Mac will boot up without those login items loading. Test this and see if the problem persists. \n\n\n*\n\n*If the problem does persist, I'd then remove any fonts you've installed yourself.\n\n*If the problem goes away you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then go back and add them back one by one until you've identified the culprit.\n\n\nLet me know how you go.\n[EDIT]\nI forgot to answer your question about what the difference is between booting into Safe Mode and booting normally. In a nutshell, booting into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*doesn't load Login Items and any custom fonts you've installed (which is what my answer above is based on)\n\n*ensures that only macOS kernel extensions are loaded\n\n*runs a number of additional checks during startup (e.g. verifying/repairing your drive's directory, etc)\n\n*deletes various caches\n\n\nThe last two can result in your system effectively repairing itself if your problems are related to corrupted caches or directory issues. In your case, since the problems didn't go away after previously booting into Safe Mode, the problem is most likely related to Login Items or 3rd party kernel extensions.\n\nA: this solution might be weird but it worked for me. Turn off your Wi-Fi and try to open your applications again.\n\nA: My problem was running icloud. Once it was disabled, the computer runs as expected.\n", "Q: How do I reset all gatekeeper rules?

Useful for starting over\n                           if the database gets messed up beyond recognition.\n\nThe developers included a default copy to ensure that if you mess up the database, you can simply copy the default database to the database location, reboot, and be ready to roll.\nHowever there is an even easier way to do this, it's also the recommended way. See the man pages:\n --reset-default\n          Unconditionally reset the system policy database to its default\n          value. This discards all changes made by administrators. It also\n          heals any corruption to the database. It does not implicitly\n          either enable or disable the facility. This must be done as the\n          super user. Reboot after use.\n\nJust run:\nsudo spctl --reset-default\n\nand then reboot your Mac and everything will be back to normal.\nFixed Output:\n\nNow everything's back to normal:\n\nAs shown I cannot install any new apps that are not from the App Store. While the gatekeeper system is disabled or if it has no rules, I can load the app without an issue. Thought disabling gatekeeper isn't recommended from a security context, it's better to grant exemptions to trusted and verified apps that are not signed, though the best and most security friendly way to do things is to sign your apps without an exeception.\nIn the future always be careful when adjusting gatekeeper rules though I'm glad there's a simple way to reset it back to the default set of rules.

Because most of these files are Mac files, I am using Mac Terminal to do so.  I've tried every combination of cp, rsync, and ditto that I could come up with.  \nThe problem lies in the fact that many of these files have a similar name and every once in a while I'll come across one that has a tilde character in the file name.  Depending on what variation of cp or rsync command I use, when it comes across this it either fails, stating that file already exists, or, skips the file with the tilde all together and continues on with the process.  \nFor example: \"28910 BP Umba Show.SIT\" is treated as identical to \"28910B~1.SIT\" and therefore will not copy to the new archive location.\nAny help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.\n\nA: The filename 28910B~1.SIT looks like an MS-DOS abbreviated file name that has more than the 8.3 characters (long file names).\nIt's important to note that from Windows 2000, both the long name and the shortened 8.3 name were retained (the file had both names)\n\n...when an application saves a file on a computer running Windows\n  2000, both the 8.3 file name and long file name are retained.\n\nFor example, 28910 BP Umba Show.SIT is automatically abbreviated to 28910B~1.SIT and duplicates are incremented (28910B~2.SIT, 28910B~3.SIT, 28910B~4.SIT, etc.)  You can read more about this naming convention on Microsoft Tech Network\nThere's a good chance it's a dupe of one of your files, but the only way to know for certain is to open both and verify.\nFrom the comment:\n\nEither way, I need some magic that will copy the archive and ignore\n  the tilde.\n\nIt can't ignore the tilde - it's there and it must be dealt with;  as far as macOS is concerned, the two files have identical names (because they do).\nTo copy both files but not overwrite the one already in the destination folder, you can to a quick test in your command to see if the file already exists in a for/do loop:\nfor file in /source/directory; do $time=date +%s; if [[ -f /target/directory/$file ]]; then cp $file ${file}-${time}; else cp $file /target/directory/$file; fi; done\n\nThis command will parse through your source directory, check if the file exists in the target directory, if it does it will copy the file over appending the current time in seconds (to ensure no multiple dupes); if no dupe exists, it just copies the file over. \n", "Q: Safari (and system) share menu - Messages and other items missing in Sierra System configuration\n\n\n*\n\n*Running Sierra (10.12.5)\n\n*MacBook Pro 13\" (Early 2015) \n\n\nIssue\nMessages and many other options are missing from the system Share menu, both in Safari and in the Share Menu extensions pane.\n\nThese among others are missing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Messages (most annoying)\n\n*Facebook\n\n*Twitter\n\n*Linkedin\n\n*Vimeo\n\n*Flickr\n\n\nHere's what I've tried so far with no success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update to latest Sierra 10.12.5\n\n*Run this command line to force-reload launch services\n\n*Disable and re-enable iCloud contacts\n\n*Disable and reenable System Integrity Protection\n\n\nRelated observations\n\n\n*\n\n*Under Preferences -> Internet Accounts, I cannot check the box next to 'Share Menu' for Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo etc, even though accounts are correctly configured.\n\nReally appreciate any help!\nUpdate 7/11:\nI just got an old 2011 MackBook Pro repaired, and upgraded it from El Capitan to Sierra.

So I am not sure if this is supposed to happen but applications in '/Applications/' do not appear to be checked by Gatekeeper (As I previously asked and self answered about having to 'reset gatekeeper to default') the many exceptions I had added for various applications are now gone.

Tor Browser shouldn't be allowed to run with my current ruleset that doesn't have a gatekeeper exception and with me only allowing apps from the App Store. If I download the Tor Browser Bundle from the Tor Project's website and try to open it I'm denied. Is gatekeeper not checking apps in /Applications/, or since I've run in the past - is there a separate exception list outside of gatekeeper, if so how would one reset that list as well? (Note: I did a reboot after the reset to default to be safe and the question still remains). Since I reset gatekeeper the apps hash is no longer exempt. \n\nA: If I remember correctly executables are only checked by Gatekeeper if they have the quarantine filesystem attribute attached. And the quarantine filesystem attribute is (optionally) added by applications which download files from the internet.\nSo if Gatekeeper is not checking files it could be because the quarantine attribute has already been removed (after a successful check) or because they were downloading using an application that doesn't apply them in the first place (for example I think some torrent applications don't apply them, whereas most if not all web browsers do).\nFor example I just downloaded Firefox using the Safari web browser so if I run ls -l@ Firefox\\ 54.0.1.dmg to show any attached file system attributes I get the following, which includes the quarantine tag...\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 alistair  staff  59438170  7 Jul 00:23 Firefox 54.0.1.dmg\n    com.apple.metadata:kMDItemDownloadedDate          53 \n    com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms         203 \n    com.apple.quarantine          61 \n\nThis is why you see people suggesting removing the quarantine tag as a way to get around the Gatekeeper security prompts.\n", "Q: Older version of gfortran doesn't get installed despite removal newer version I installed gfortran v6.3.0 using installer, and needed to go back to 4.9.2.\nI removed gfortran using sudo rm -r /usr/local/gfortran /usr/local/bin/gfortran, but when I try to install v4.9.2 using a disk image, it says a newer version already exists. \nHow do I resolve this issue?\n\nA: You can use apps such as App Cleaner to fully uninstall apps. \nIn your case there are likely files left on your computer for v6.3.0 and using App Cleaner will remove these additional files.\nYou can do this manually by finding and deleting the .plist and .bom files associated with gfortran.

I had my 2TB USB hard drive also connected on the other USB-C slot and by accident, I completely wrote over the 2TB drive of important files instead of the 16GB MicroSD!\nThe command I executed was:\nsudo dd bs=4m if=PlexMediaPlayer-1.3.4.699-1d4f6da1.RPi2-arm.img of=/dev/disk2\nWhere /dev/disk2 was the 2TB external USB drive. The output of the command was:\n\n137+0 records in\n137+0 records out\n574619648 bytes transferred in 19.313496 secs (29752234 bytes/sec)\n\nThe drive now has the contents of what was originally in the .img file intended for the 16GB MicroSD. Everything else is gone from the 2TB external USB Drive.\nMy whole life is in that 2TB hard drive, including the photos of my kids since they were small, etc. I can't imagine what else was lying in that drive.\nI'd really appreciate any help anyone can provide. :-(\n\nA: First step: create a bit for bit copy of the destroyed drive using the dreaded dd command which took down your drive in the first place. Make sure you disable Time Machine and any other background application which wants to write on your disk (Spotlight aka mds is another one).\nSecond step: start trying to pull data off the copy (don't use the original except as read only until you've recovered your data).\nI used to use Prosoft's Data Rescue 2 & 3 but the new version requires an internet connection (for no good reason). I can't recommend it on principle. Cleverfiles's Disk Drill at least lets you preview your data before you pay. You could try Lazesoft Mac Data Recovery which is donationware. If Lazesoft gets your files back, you should donate (generous programmers deserve to be rewarded). Some of flash drive manufacturers included file recovery utilities, SanDisk RescuePro program has worked for me but maintaining a licensed copy is such a hassle I don't think I have one now.\nIf the first data recovery program fails you, you can try some others. Even if the data recovery programs destroy your backup, you can always do another bit to bit clone to try with other programs.\nSingle step version:\nI've just noticed that even free Disk Drill includes a workflow with built-in byte-to-byte copy to DMG routine which would be easier to implement and get you off the command line right now.\n\nJust proceed with \"Backup / Backup into DMG-image\". The unique aspect of the byte-to-byte backups is the fact they actually store the contents of data sectors that were marked as empty, not occupied by data. Yes, you get it right, the sectors where your lost data can still reside. Once the backup disk image is created, you may start your hard drive recovery from the image instead of the real hardware. This will ensure the final failure will not occur while Deep Scanning, more data stays safe and potentially recoverable.\n\nAs others pointed out, keeping backups is really, really important as everyone makes mistakes and bits fry every once in a while.\nGood luck getting your important personal archives and photos back!\n", "Q: Can I play my music on the iOS Music app with a sleep timer? Maybe I’m going crazy, but I'm sure that I could listen to music on my old iPhone 4 and set the Music app to play to a sleep timer. So, if I wanted, I could play music for 30 minutes when I went to bed and it would automatically stop playing after 30 minutes.\nI've now got a new iPhone and cannot for the life of me work out how to do this?\nDid I imagine being able to do this on my iPhone 4, or was I just using another music app to do it?\n\nA: I can't tell you what app you were using on your iPhone 4, but I can tell you how you can still play music on your new iPhone using a sleep timer. \nTo do what you want, follow this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Clock app\n\n*Tap on the Timer option at bottom right\n\n*Set the timer to 30 min\n\n*Tap on the When Timer Ends option\n\n*Now swipe up until you see the Stop Playing option at the very bottom and select it\n\n*Tap on Set at top right\n\n\nNow you can use the Music app (and most 3rd party music apps as well) to listen to your music and your iPhone will stop playing it 30 minutes later.\n[EDIT]\nSo, the reason for your confusion (understandably so in my opinion), is that Apple’s implementation of this is OS wide, not as a specific function of the Music app. \nThe advantage of this is you can use the feature with 3rd party apps like Spotify, but IMHO it would have also been good to have the option within the Music app itself. If you feel that way too, you can submit feedback to Apple.\n", "Q: How to let my VM connect the network?

(Ethernet) in VMware:\nIn your Linux system they appear as:\n\n\n*\n\n*eno16777736 (an interface bridged to your Mac's physical Wi-Fi interface en0)\n\n*eno33554992 (an interface connected to your Mac's vmnet8 = \"Share with my Mac\"\n\n*eno50332216 (a second interface connected to your Mac's vmnet8 = \"Share with my Mac\"\n\n\nvmnet1/vmnet8 are virtual network devices created by VMware Fusion and provide a host-only and a NAT'ed network to VMs.\nNow your Linux host is NAT'ed two times to your 192.168.1.0/24 network via vmnet8 and is in the 192.168.1.0/24 network itself at the same time - which is a bit over the top and causes routing problems in your environment.\nSo shut down the VM and either remove the two \"Share with my Mac\" interfaces in the settings > Removable devices of the CentOS VM or remove the bridged interface and one of the \"Share with my Mac\" interfaces. Which procedure to choose/path to go depends on the purpose of the VM.\n", "Q: My Mac gives me a black screen after logging into one account, but not another Whenever I start my MacBook (mid 2009, running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6), like any normal day, I click on my main account and log in. \nToday, when I tried typing in my password, it let me in as usual but I get nothing but a black screen with the spinning beachball cursor.

I've also run First Aid on the disk, but that didn't resolve the issue either.\nHow can I troubleshoot this further?\n\nA: Removing the user/library/preferences could help, however, if you still have the same issue and booting in safe mode has not solved the problem, means that the user is damaged.\nso try removing user/library/caches\nif you still have the problem, the fastest solutions are next:   \n\n\n*\n\n*restored a time machine backup to a date where issue does not exist if you have one.\n\n*create a new user as administrator, sign into this new user and from finder transfer the content from the old user to the new one. \nnote: in this step you tested that preferences were not the caused of the problem, so moving the content of this folder from the old to the new one will bring you all the settings into the new account. Also note that apps are open from all users, so you will not have to install any app either. the only thing you would have to do is to set up the mail accounts in mail app from the new user.\n\nA: You may have a login item on the account that is hanging for some reason. Try holding down the shift key when you log in to the account and seeing if you can get it. If so, go to the accounts preferences and take a look at the login items for that account and see if you see something you don't recognize or that's new and try removing it from the list.\n\nA: Try this method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your Mac and connect it to the MagSafe adapter and a wall outlet.\n\n*Hold down Shift + Control + Option + Power keys simultaneously for a few seconds.\n\n*Release all the keys at the same time, then start your Mac as usual.\n", "Q: How can I set program associations in mac?

Even though I have been a member for a long time, I am a newbie on the Ubuntu command line or the logic behind it.  I am asking this forum because a lot of you are already above average or experts in analyzing issues and providing workarounds since you know the ins and outs of the Ubuntu or Linux operating system.  I am in no way trying to get a Linux certification, I only want to install a working Ubuntu system in order for me to install the program that I need in the first place.\nSo as an overview:\nI have roughly 500GB SSD HDD on my Macbook Pro laptop.  I used disk utility to shrink the Mac HD partition to 400GB.  So now I have 100 GB to install my Ubuntu Server OS.\nIf it's a straightforward clean install of an Ubuntu Server, I have done that and made it work side by side with MacOS.  What I want is to use an Ubuntu ISO image with preconfigured programs inside of it.  There is an ISO image available for that, so I would like to know if what I am going to do below is the logical way of making this work?\n\n\n*\n\n*I used disk utility to shrink the Mac HD partition to from 500GB to 400GB.  So now I have 100 GB to install my Ubuntu Server preconfigured ISO image.\n\n*Download the Ubuntu ISO image with preconfigured programs and applications to a USB pen/thumb drive (minimum size of 2GB).\n\n*Use Unetbootin and select that ISO image and make the USB pen/thumb drive bootable.\n\n*Install reFind in order to have a boot manager to choose to boot in MacOS or Linux environment.  Naturally, I will choose Linux or Debian environment.\n\n*This will then go to the usual setup menu of Ubuntu, or will I be encountering a different set of menu options?  What do I need to choose then?\n\n*If the preconfigured ISO Ubuntu image was created with a 25Gb of HD space.  What commands or what steps do I need to fulfill in order to expand the 25GB to occupy the whole 100GB that I partitioned in step 1?\n\n\nI read the procedure on this link:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/126153/how-to-resize-partitions\nDoes this mean when I use gparted, it will then detect the 75GB free space and would let me merge it with the 25GB space the pre-configured Ubuntu image is occupying?\nAny help is gladly appreciated.\n\nA: The Ubuntu image requires a different file system. VMware usage is different than Bootcamp. As you've had success installing Ubuntu server to work side by side with Mac OS, I'd suggest you built on top of that. You could safely replace the working Ubuntu install with an alternative install. You may find that many drivers are missing or disabled though, as the VMware version was counting on different hardware than your MBP. Your full Ubuntu install took the hardware into account.\nIf you really want to use this pre-configured VMware version, you might want to consider running it in VMware. Sorry to be a party pooper with this advice, but I hate to see anyone looking at as many hours of installation work with such slim possibilities of getting a truly usable result.\nOn the plus side, if you can at least boot and get graphics with the ISO version, you may be able to run a reconfiguration script to optimise the install for your hardware.\n", "Q: Change url on safari search I'm trying to move from chrome to safari, but there is something which I'm not able to do so far.\nI work with Jira, and when I try to browse a ticket for a known project, I can't edit the url to browse a specific ticket\n\nFor example this ticket, If I want to go browse VSGN-146, and previously I was working on VSGN-145 (known project), on Chrome I start typing \"vsgn\" and then I move to the end of the url and I can change the 5 for a 6.\nIf I try to do that in safari, the end of the line is \"... - JIRA\"\n\nSo the question is, is there a way to edit the url instead of the site description on safari?

A few days ago a hacked version of a Google Chrome extension I use was distributed via Chrome's automatic extension updates. \nIs it possible to stop Google Chrome from automatically updating extensions?\nI've seen instructions on how to do block Google Chrome itself from updating, and how to block individual extensions from updating, but those were for Windows, not Mac OS X.\nI'm currently running Chrome 60.0.3112.50 beta, under OS 10.12.5.\nThanks for any assistance.\n\nA: Yeah, it can be blocked.  There is an extension to block auto-update by extensions.  See https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extension-update-disabler/pfijgddffdeabjfpkfikmkfdpaleebek\nDisclaimer: I wrote it.  At this instant, I am its only user, so exercise caution.  \nIt provides an enable button and a disable button, which enable/disable all extensions from auto-updating.  It works by updating the manifest files to prevent/enable the extensions from finding their auto-update site.\n\nA: The \"official\" Google-given method given is this, but it doesn't work. In Terminal\ndefaults write com.google.Keystone.Agent checkInterval 0\n\nThe most foolproof method is to empty these directories:\n/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/\n~/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/\n\nThen change the permissions on both folders named GoogleSoftwareUpdate so that there's no owner and no read/write/execute permissions.\nIn terminal:\ncd /Library/Google/\nsudo chown nobody:nogroup GoogleSoftwareUpdate\nsudo chmod 000 GoogleSoftwareUpdate\ncd ~/Library/Google/\nsudo chown nobody:nogroup GoogleSoftwareUpdate\nsudo chmod 000 GoogleSoftwareUpdate\n\nIf you want to be double-certain, then do the same for the folder Google one level up.\ncd /Library/\nsudo chown nobody:nogroup Google\nsudo chmod 000 Google\ncd ~/Library/\nsudo chown nobody:nogroup Google\nsudo chmod 000 Google\n\nI did this immediately after installing the Chrome version I need for my machine, and it worked perfectly. Now when I check About Google Chrome it gives me the error \"Update failed (error: 10)\"\n\nA: If the chrome extension that you do not want to update is on Github (which many if not most of them are), you can simply:\n(1.) clone the Github repo, \n(2.) reset the head to the version that you want, and \n(3.) enable Developer Mode at chrome://extensions/\n(4.) select the \"Load unpacked\" option from chrome://extensions/, and then select the folder enclosing the source code for the extension.\nI recently used this technique to downgrade my version of Reddit Link Opener, which no longer supports users who have opted out of using that site's redesign. This worked for me on MacOS, but should work on all platforms.\nIf the extension is loaded as an unpacked extension (in the manner described above), it will NOT auto-update to a newer version.\n", "Q: How to connect iPad to Macbook I have a macbook air running Mavericks, and I want to transfer files to and from an ipad. When I connect them via usb, the ipad does not appear in the filesystem anywhere, and I cannot mount it via Disk Utility either. \nSome things I have seen recommended elsewhere: \n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade the Macbook's operating system to Sierra, then upgrade iTunes, then transfer individual files via iTunes. I want to avoid this if possible, and I have deleted iTunes because it was causing problems. Also, I want to be able to transfer files which are not compatible with iTunes. \n\n*Jailbreak the iPad. I also wish to avoid this; the iPad is not mine and it would void the owner's warranty. \nI use this for accessing the filesystem on my android device via my macbook and it works fine. Is there something like \"adb\" for the ipad so I can connect via the command line? \n\nA: In short, no. \nAndroid does not sandbox apps like iOS does. There are many apps that expose the filesystem without jailbreaking, but every iOS app doesn’t look outside it’s own sandbox for files. \nWorkarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*use a filer app like Dropbox, box, documents (I believe by readdle) and iTunes to transfer all your files to that app sandbox. \n\n*wait for iOS 11 when general file management arrives\n\n*use any of the dozens of cloud sync options. (Some of these even have the ability to set up a local cache so the Mac uploads to a server on your network and the iPad downloads from that local server the content but almost all end up,putting a copy of your file in the cloud somewhere outside your local network)\n\n\nAs to your points. \n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes will write just about any file to the container apps. If the iOS app tells iTunes to restrict files to a pattern, that’s more on the iOS app you choose to contain the files than iTunes which will transfer any file to a general storage app. \n\n*Not a good idea as jailbreak aren’t widely shared anymore and also, you can get official apps that do most of what jailbrreaking used to provide.\nmost apps on iOS just play by the rules and use document share scheme and the upcoming filer API with iOS 11. Since iOS implemented legitimate doc sharing, all the apps that used to do this (sugar sync, cubby, all manner of WebDAV and filer apps ) have withered or died. \n\n", "Q: Discrepancy in hard drive space; can I delete these files? While trying to clear space from my MacBook Pro hard drive, I noticed a 12.4 GB discrepancy between the amount of free space shown in Storage Bar in About This Mac and the total sum inside my Macintosh HD using OmniDiskSweeper (or du -sh * in Terminal). I’ve managed to account for 9.1 GB of that by running ODS as the root user.\nWhere could the remaining 3.3 GB be?\nCan any of the major offenders be deleted to free up space? They are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd/data (4.3 vs. 0 GB)\n\n*/.DocumentRevisions/.cs/ChunkStorage/0/0/ (1.5 vs. 0 GB)\n\n*/private/var/folders/zz/ (1.3 GB vs. 9.5 MB, mostly in the file CFNetworkDownload_L4uNTH.tmp)\n\n*/.MobileBackups/Computer/ (1.1 vs. 0 GB)\n\n*/.Spotlight-V100/Store-V2/ (0.6 vs 0 GB)\n\n\nA: You can certainly delete the two temporary items in your list:\n\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd/data/\n\n*/private/var/folders/zz/CFNetworkDownload_L4uNTH.tmp\nAvoid deleting the folder structures but large files in these locations can be safely removed.\nTo be extra safe, restart your Mac first and then remove any files. The restart will ensure the files are not in use.\n\nA: Getting rid of these files is a great move, but keep in mind many of these caches will regenerate. For instance, spotlight files will regenerate at a cost of high processor usage and noisy fans (in a MacBook) immediately (look out for mds in Activity Monitor). MobileBackups is backup data from your iPhone which you might want on hand if you lose your phone and which will probably replicate the next time you plug it in.\nDon't forget that if you sleep your computer, you'll often end up with a sleep image the same size as your physical drive. As we are almost all using flash drives now, don't forget flash drives need about 20% free disk space for self-cleaning and maintenance (I'm thinking of the SSD's which do their own garbage collection like Samsung and most of the Intel SSD). Spinning disks can go down to 10% but anything saved after about 50% usage is 1/3 or more slower than peak performance.\nClean out the files but think about upgrading the disk or moving some files or applications off to external storage. Time to go and follow my own useful advice. We humans generally procrastinate on important but not urgent tasks.\n\nA: The /.MobileBackups folder is created by Time Machine, which saves snapshots to your local disk when your Time Machine volume is not available. To delete those snapshots and free up the space, the recommended way is to turn off local Time Machine backups altogether, by issuing the command:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\nYou can always turn them back on again later if your requirements change.\n", "Q: iCloud Contacts web interface on Windows - How to copy an address? I maintain my contact list on an iPad/iPhone and use iCloud's web interface on my desktop PC.\nI cannot find any way to copy any data that is also a link, such as a person's address or email, from the iCloud web interface.  The usual Alt-hilight to bypass link-following does not highlight, and right-clicking does not provide any \"copy\" option.  \nIs there a way to highlight and copy information from the iCloud web interface when that information is also a link?\n\nA: After some experimentation in different browsers I have come to the conclusion that on Firefox, the alt-click-drag action to select link text while suppressing link-follow seems to require finer mouse-cursor placement.  Start just outside the bounding box and nothing gets selected; start too far in and one character doesn't get selected.\nBut at least you CAN select the text.  It goes into the clipboard with each field followed by a newline, but that's a minor issue.  There really should be a \"copy to clipboard\" button.\n", "Q: How to install the Mono package in a wineskin app? I created a wineskin app for one of my windows games on steam (H1z1). I installed steam and downloaded the game on steam in the wineskin app but it crashes at launch in steam. \nI created the wineskin using PortingKit, it offered at the beginning to install Mono but it also said I should skip it so I did. \nNow that I'm troubleshooting i'd like to try with Mono in the wineskin, how can I add it at this point please ?\n\nA: If memory serves, you can just delete the following file, and these dialogs will come up on the next run:\n<YOUR_APP_NAME>.app/Contents/Resources/.update-timestamp\n\nOf course, this dot file will be hidden by default and inside an application bundle, so it might be easiest to remove it by Terminal.\nOtherwise, you could enable hidden files and right-click, browse contents to find it.\n", "Q: Edit commands in iTerm2 with standard OS text keyboard/mouse controls I'm a heavy terminal user, but I'd like to be edit commands like I would in any other mac app, e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*select a portion of a command with the mouse and press backspace to delete it\n\n*use shift+up to select all of a command to the start\n\n*use the mouse to click and place the cursor (not in conjunction with holding modifier keys)\n\n\nI've tried Preferences > Profiles > Keys > \"Natural Text Editing\" but it doesn't seem to work.\nI appreciate that many people prefer to use terminal-specific bindings, e.g. vim/emacs modes, but I'd just like to be able to interact with a terminal like I'd interact with any other app.\n\nA: I use the bash shell and do much of what you want. I use the mouse to select something and command-c to copy or command-v to paste. I can place the cursor wherever I want with mouse. Well it doesn't really move the cursor but I highlight what I want to copy or cut. The up and down arrows scrolls thru previous commands. Typing tcsh adds more functionality. \n", "Q: How can I find out which Mac apps are 32-bit? On June 28, 2017, Apple announced that\n\nmacOS High Sierra will be the last macOS release to support 32-bit apps without compromise.\n\nHow can I find out which apps on my Mac are 32-bit so that I can see if I need to upgrade them?\n\nA: The other answers so far, from what I understand, will list 32-bit macOS apps (and maybe some 32-bit binaries) in the metadata index. If you want to list every 32-bit only executable binary on your system give this one-liner a go:\nfind / -type f -perm +111 -exec file -p {} \\; -exec head -c 1 /dev/zero \\; | xargs -0 -n 1 sh -c 'echo \"$@\" | head -n 1' -- | grep -v x86_64 | grep -E Mach-O.+i386\n\nIf you have GNU findutils installed this can probably be considerably simplified. Some of the complexity here is to overcome the limitations of the BSD findutils included in macOS.\n\nA: This one line Terminal command will collect a list of apps into a text file on your Desktop.  It grabs the 6 lines before and 2 lines after every occurrence of \"(Intel): No\" in the query.  It does not however dig into the 32 bit supporting binaries or libraries for already compiled 64 bit apps.  That list is much more extensive and I cannot find any resource that addresses a deeper level of concern if it's even an issue.\nsystem_profiler SPApplicationsDataType | grep -B 6 -A 2 \"(Intel): No\" > ~/Desktop/32BitAppList.txt\n\n\nA: In the Finder hit cmdF to get a search window.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Search: This Mac\n\n*Hit the first search criterion and choose \"Other...\" and here \"Executable Architectures\" \"Is\" \"i386\"\n\n*Hit the + button and add a second criterion \"Executable Architectures\" \"Is not\" \"x86_64\"\n\nand you will get a list of all i386 only (i.e. 32-bit) apps.\n\nIn Terminal this is done with:\nmdfind \"(kMDItemExecutableArchitectures == 'i386') && (kMDItemExecutableArchitectures != 'x86_64')\"\n\n\nA: One way to identify what 32-bit apps you're still using is to use the System Information option under About This Mac. The exact steps differ depending on the version of macOS you're running, but below are the broad steps you should be able to follow to suit your circumstances:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Apple Menu\n\n*Select About This Mac\n\n*In the About This Mac window that pops up, click on the System Report... button at bottom left (if you're using an older OS, you may need to click on the More Info... button near the centre bottom).\n\n*This opens up the System Information window (or System Profiler window in older versions of the OS). \n\n*In the Sidebar on the left you will see a number of headings and subheadings.\n\n*Under the Software heading (it's the 3rd one down) you'll see a subheading labelled Applications. Click on this.\n\n*In the main part of the window on the right-hand side you will see a list of apps appear. Be patient as this may take a little while to populate.\n\n*Once the list appears, you'll see column headings at the top. \n\n*The last column is labelled 64-Bit (Intel) Click on this column heading to sort apps by whether or not they're 64-Bit (i.e. they'll have either a Yes or No listed against each app). \n\n\nRefer to the image below as an example:\n\nNOTE: In the above image I've deliberately not sorted the last column so you can see entries with both a Yes and No listed against them. So, in the example above you'll see that iMovie v10.1.6 is a 64-Bit app while iMovie 9.0.9 is not 64-Bit.\n\nEdit - If the above steps result in an error\nI have seen reports that a small number of users are getting a \"The plug-in did not respond quickly enough while gathering this information\" error message while waiting for the list to populate.\nIf this happens, quit the System Information app (or System Profiler app in older versions of macOS) and start again, but this time skip steps 1 to 4 and go directly to your Applications/Utilities folder and open the System Information app (or System Profiler app) directly from there. Once it opens, follow Steps 5 to 8 above.\n\nA: When you just need to check a single application:\nfile myapplication\nFor instance, my ray tracer, rt:\n==> file rt\nrt: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n==>\n\nThe file command basically looks at many kinds of files and tries to identify them. For OSX executables, you'll almost always see one or more of these: i386, x86_64, and ppc which respectively are 32-bit intel/amd architectures, 64-bit intel/amd architectures, and power PC architectures (these are quite old now.) So you really only have to be concerned with i386 (32-bit applications) and x86_64 (64-bit applications.) \nFor packaged applications, one should right click and Show Package Contents. In most apps, under contents → macOS one will find an executable. Its path should be used as the argument for file.\n\nA: I serially kept having the \"The plug-in did not respond quickly enough while gathering this information.\" issue, and couldn't resolve it using any of the suggested methods.\nTurns out there's a command-line tool called system_profiler that provides the same information.\nSo I went straight to the source and wrote a little ruby script to compile a list with more information on where the application is located and the source of install (when available).\nYou can find the script here.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use etc/hosts to block a specific part of a whole website I know how to use etc/hosts to block something such as youtube.com\nHowever, I when I try to use etc/hosts to block something such as: youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector\nnothing seems to happen. Is it possible to block a specific channel on youtube with etc/hosts instead of the entire site, and if so how is it done?\nHere is my etc/hosts file (youtube user is modified):\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.

I'm trying to stream videos from my Mac with a high-quality HDMI cable to a 1080p HD TV via a Denon AV receiver. \nHere's the issue:\nWhen I hook up with my run-of-the-mill Windows laptop to my Denon AV receiver box, everything works perfectly.\nWhen I hook up with my 2016 Macbook Pro, it does project the screen onto the HD TV. However, the TV screen goes black every 5 seconds, no matter what is being displayed (i.e. it blinks even when not displaying intensive graphics).\nI've already reset my NVRAM. Any other ideas?\n\nA: Is that the MBP with only USB-C ports? How do you connect your MBP to Denon? via some kind of USB-C to HDMI converter?\nI've personally tried many different kinds of converters and have been disappointed by them. Pretty sure that's the root of your problem though. Be sure that the adapter you use does NOT support DHCP 2.2\n", "Q: How to mount external volume on /Users I have been trying to migrate from an old Mac Pro with big internal disk to a new iMac with (small) internal SSD and big external Thunderbolt disk for a while and found no direct answer. I have a time machine backup on an external disk. My preferred solution would be to mount the external disk on /Users. Apple support (whom I chatted with) does not have an answer. How to go about this?\n\nA: Documenting my own solution here, but would be happy to hear whether others have tried this in different ways. There are just a few steps to consider.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a dummy user with admin permissions with home directory on the built-in /Users disk\n\n*Name your external volume to something, e.g. Home - it would normally then be mounted on /Volumes/Home\n\n*Find the Volume UUID for your external disk using diskutil list /Volumes/Home, let's say the UUID is XYZ\n\n*Now comes the magic, use the sudo vifs command to add a line to your (by default empty) fstab file, the line should look like this:\nUUID=XYZ /Users hfs rw 0 2\n\nFinally, reboot your machine and you are good to go.\nCaveat 1: if your external disk is missing or broken you will not have home directories, so do make a backup!\nCaveat 2: if your external disk is missing and you do not have a dummy user (step 1 above) you will not be able to log in at all.\nAfter this you may want to restore a time machine backup. However, Migration Assistant tries to outsmart you and checks the amount of available space for the root directory (which is small) rather than the externally mounted /Users directory. To circumvent this you have to use a two-step process:\n\n\n*Restore user details (accounts) but not their data by de-selecting all the data directories when restoring using Migration Assistant, after doing this you will have re-created users without most of their data files.\n\n*Using the command line tool tmutil you can restore without the check:\ntmutil restore /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/PreviousMachine/PreviousDisk/Users/{joe,anne} /Users\n(please run man tmutil before trying this and use the correct directory names).\n\nA: Your mount solution works, but I prefer a different setup leaving /Users and /Users/Shared on the boot volume. You can point an existing account at the mounted home folder easily:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201548\n\n*Account on external HD\nThis way you can still have a local admin account to run updates and install software that don’t follow the rules of not assuming a user folder is on the same volume as the system with a local admin account. Your method will break harder in these cases. Apple allows (and designed updates) to have only one off accounts not in the boot drive /Users as opposed to over mounting it entirely. \n", "Q: Prohibitory sign on boot after Sierra update, can't mount disk anymore A few days ago I decided to update to Sierra from El Capitan on both the disks on my MacBook Pro (mid 2012); the update on my SSD went without a hitch so I decided I'd update my other disk, too. I downloaded the .app and the installation started as normal; once it got to the point where I'd have to restart, though, the problems started.\nOnce the Mac booted, a folder with a question mark appeared; I read that resetting the VRAM and choosing a startup disk (again?) helps in these cases, and it did; however, now I get a prohibitory sign whenever I try to log in on my hard disk. To be exact, it happens after I insert the login password and the loading bar is almost full.\nIs there some way to gain back access to the volume, or even just access to the files? I have 100GB+ of Photos Library that I really don't want to lose.\nHere are some of the things I tried:\nBasic Fix & Repair Options : from both the terminal and Disk Utility, on both Single User Mode and Recovery Mode. The \"Repair\" option in Disk Utility, in particular, gives this error: \"File system exit code is 8. An internal error has occured\". Trying to Mount the volume, in whatever way, has no effect whatsoever or I just get an error that the volume can't be mounted. Also, the partition now shows up as greyed out and called \"--\" (empty); it was called \"Macintosh HD\". The name still appears in several other disk utility apps, but still something to note.\nRecovery Mode : I tried re-installing the OS but the volume is now unmounted so it doesn't show up as a possible option. Also, I found an article saying that booting problems could come from old extensions that no longer work after an update; the article described the terminal steps to take in order to move all non-Apple extensions to a folder on the volume and make it bootable again. However, same problem, the volume is unnamed and unmounted and it doesn't show up anywhere, nor can I \"cd\" into it. \nSafe Mode : I can't start Safe Boot into the damaged partition: to load it, I need to hold the Option key and choose it from a list and doing that and holding Shift too doesn't do anything. I can only boot in Safe Mode on my working OS X partition (SSD) and that defeats the purpose. Thinking about it now, is there a way to Safe Boot into a different disk/partition?\nSingle User Mode & fsck : I ran the fsck command (and variations) multiple times on the faulty partition and others, too, and at some point I got a \"GRUB.Geom.Hard Disk.Read.Error\" or something like that, that as far as I can see now it's been resolved as it doesn't appear anymore after that; still, no success on booting the OS X partition.\nForce Mount : using the terminal and the readOnly option, too; no success. All that mounts when I try to mount the whole disk is an \"EFI\" partition that contains a folder called \"APPLE\" with three more folders inside it: CACHES (one more folder, empty), EXTENSIONS (Firmware.scap) and FIRMWARE (MBP91_00D3_B0C_LOCKED.scap). What are these?\nVRAM Reset : did nothing.\nVolume Rebuilding : I've tried using both TechTool Pro and DiskWarrior to rebuild the partition, as both apps signaled damaged volume integrity and structure; neither app was able to rebuild the volume. TechTool Pro, in particular, stops at the very first verification step, \"Journaled HFS Plus Volume\". Does that mean the volume isn't recognised as HFS+ anymore? Does this have any significance?\nOS X Combo Updates : The volume, being unmounted, doesn't show up so I can't install anything on that partition.\nData Recovery Tools : I tried different software and almost all of them extracted few files with very big sizes, all unreadable.\nCloning : I made two different .dmg images of my volume, using Disk Utility and Data Rescue 4, but I can't mount any of them as I get a \"no mountable file systems\" error.\n\nThis is my partition scheme; the \"damaged\" volume, on /dev/disk1, has the identifier disk1s2.\nAs you can see, the same disk holds two more partitions, booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux; both are working correctly, so this rules out the hard disk suddenly failing, I guess.

But I can't run Compressor 4.0.7 or those utilities on macOS 10.12.\nA distributed processing is necessary feature for any command line VFX professional application. For instance: Nuke, Shake, Fusion, Maya, Houdini, Renderman, etc...\nI am convinced, there is a workaround to use the distributed processing for CLI applications via Terminal (even if this feature is not explicitly supported in Compressor 4.3 GUI).\nP.S. Distributed processing isn't supported in Compressor's GUI since 2013 (from v4.1). Compressor's versions 4.1, 4,2 and 4.3 have integrated Qmaster's core allowing to process just Final Cut Pro X and Motion batches using shared computers (as instances). Now Compressor is mainly used for transcoding.\n\nLook at Qmaster.framework located in:\n/Applications/Compressor/Contents/Plugins/Compressor/CompressorKit.bundle/Contents/Frameworks\n\nTo see a list of CLI commands, type this in Terminal:\n/Applications/Compressor.app/Contents/MacOS/Compressor -help\n\n\nA: After a thorough research I found out that it's impossible to use Apple Compressor 4.3 via command line for distributed processing.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Xcode 9 on a mid 2009 MacBook Pro 17 inches? I'm looking for a MacBook to develop iOS apps and I've found this mid 2009 17 inch MacBook Pro at a reasonable price.\nDoes Xcode 9 run on it?\n\nA: Not officially, no.\nXcode 9 will require macOS Sierra 10.12.4 to run. Unfortunately, the Mid-2009 17\" MacBook Pro can only run the latest version of OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.\nHowever, unofficially the Mid-2009 17\" MacBook Pro can run macOS Sierra by virtue of the macOS Sierra Patcher Tool. \nIf this is something you want to consider doing, make sure you read all the information on the macOS Sierra Patcher Tool page as it contains important information you should weigh up before proceeding. If it was me I would not proceed without a full backup ready so you could recover your system if all goes bad.\nNOTE: I have not seen Xcode 9 actually installed on any unsupported Mac, so cannot confirm that it would work on one which has macOS Sierra installed as a result of the macOS Sierra Patcher Tool.\n\nA: The laptop you are considering is a dual core i7 in all likelihood. This will not be a fun computer on which to run Xcode or El Capitan or Sierra (the last OS I'd run on a dual core MBP would be 10.8 Mountain Lion, Yosemite would perform particularly poorly).\nFor the difference in price you would be much better off to get one of the quad core i7 from early 2011 or last 2011. They aren't expensive now. Ideally you'd look for one with the weaker 6490 graphic card as the higher end Radeon 6750 burns out very frequently and leaves you with no graphics at all when it does. I speak from experience. I've had three Radeon 6750's burn out the motherboard on two MBP's over the year. Until this December the repair was covered by an Apple extended warranty. No longer.\nYou should run your 2011 MBP 15\" or 17\" (I have both and far prefer the 17\") with only the built-in Intel 3000 graphics enabled. You can do this with free/donationware gfxCardStatus by Cody Krieger (I did donate as gfxCardStatus is lifeline for these computers and Apple never did as much for MBP users). This does mean no external monitors. If you want a dual monitor setup (for software development dual monitors is very helpful), you should buy any of the old MacPro's. There are easy ways to run even the most recent OS on them. The 2011 MBP's run much quieter with the discreet graphic card disabled.\nOld MacBook Pro's are not for the faint of heart. One big plus with the 2011 and earlier MBP's is that unlike later models, one can disassemble and repair them relatively easily.\n", "Q: Is there a way to put images in cells in tables in iOS Numbers? 3.2 Is there a way to put images in cells in tables in Numbers iOS version 3.2?

My MBP sees the \"JBL Flip 3\" and displays a Pair button. I click on this and \"connecting...\" displays.\nHowever, a spinning wheel appears to the right and spins forever and the Flip 3 power light continues to flash. \nNothing else is listed in the MBP Bluetooth list. Nothing else is paired to the Flip 3. I've tried all kinds of combinations with no success.\nWhat else can I try?\n\nA: First of all I would check with JBL Support for any known issues, updates, compatibility, etc.\nOn the MBP side of things you could try resetting both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller and pairing your JBL Flip 3 first. However, this will reset all connected Bluetooth devices, including a keyboard and mouse.\nIn other words, this will remove all existing pairing information for Bluetooth devices, so each will need to be reconnected.\nI have some steps you can follow, but I strongly suggest you read all of the steps first before commencing (or perhaps print out the instructions / view them on another device).\nBefore starting, ensure you have the Bluetooth icon showing in the menu bar. If it is not there, open System Preferences > Bluetooth and enable the option Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar.\nOnce done, follow these steps:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. Once the menu is showing, release the keys.    \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu, choose Debug > Remove All Devices\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys again and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu,  choose Debug > Reset the Bluetooth Module\n\n*Shutdown your Mac\n\n*Ensure your JBL Flip 3 is fully powered off\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*On your Mac, click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar \n\n*Select the Set Up Bluetooth Device option\n\n*Now ensure your JBL Flip 3 is in pairing mode (i.e. press the power button for at least 3 seconds until you see the blue flashing light)\n\n*Once the Setup Assistant finds the Flip 3, select it from the list and click on “Continue”. \n\n*Now pair your speaker\n\n*If you have any other Bluetooth devices, you can go ahead and pair them now (or you can do it later). However, the point is to pair the JBL Flip 3 first before any other Bluetooth devices!\n\n\nA: Try open JBL Connect and turn on this:\n\nThen connect to the MacBook\n\nA: I was having the same problem with JBL Tune 230NC TWS earbuds trying to connect to a MacBook after previously having them connected to my iPhone.\nI disconnected the earbuds from my iPhone (obviously). My MacBook paired with other devices without problem.\nThe solution I found was to COMPLETELY POWER-OFF my iPhone. Then I was able to pair with the MacBook Air successfully and normally.Then after powering-on the iPhone (and disconnecting the earbuds from the MacBook - don't delete the device, just toggle it off from the Bluetooth dropdown), I could re-pair from my iPhone normally.\nAfter that it was a simple matter to toggle between MacBook and iPhone:\n\n*\n\n*open the JBL pulse box. It will pair with whichever device it was last paired with.\n\n*Disconnect it. It will go back into pairing mode.\n\n*Select it from the other device.\n\n\nA: This solved the issue for me. Thanks to Deps_stats for posting this!\ndiscussions.apple.com/thread/7850133\nThis is so silly..\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start from the beginning. Remove the speaker from the Bluetooth devices list.\n\n*Power on JBL device.\n\n*Actually HOLD down the Bluetooth button on the JBL device for 3 seconds before you try paring.\n\n*PAIR.\n\n\nNow it works for me and it shows up in my sound options.\nThe only thing different I did when it didn't work was that I didn't HOLD down the bluetooth on the JBL device. I only pressed it once... so redonkeylous! \n", "Q: Removing smart card login from my Mac I've seen a lot of questions about adding a smart card login to a Mac, but my problem is the opposite. \nI have a company smart card that I use on my personal computer sometimes for checking webmail and such.

Any ideas how to do it, or where to start? A search online didn't provide many basic ideas, but it seems to be possible.\n\nNote: Giving advice on AppleScripts is outside the scope of the Hazel support AFAIK, so I can't get any help from them.\n\nA: Okay, I've downloaded Hazel and tested the following AppleScript code on a New Rule to validate it works. The following code when used in an embedded script will set theResult to true on theFile, an audio file that is longer than 30 minutes. Any file 30 minutes or less, or a non-audio file will set theResult to false:\nset theResult to (do shell script \"[[ $(afinfo -r '\" & POSIX path of theFile & \"' | awk '/estimated duration:/{print int($3/60)}') -gt 30 ]] && echo 'true' || echo 'false'\") as boolean\nreturn theResult\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that from my first comment before posting this answer, I've changed theFileName to POSIX path of theFile, and as you can see in the image below, it validated the rule. It then also processed the rule, as I defined it, successfully.\n\n*To change the number of minutes, change the value on the right side of the operator, e.g. -gt 30 to the desired time, e.g. -gt 20. The operator can also be changed to any one of the following: -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt or -ge\n\nUnderstanding, a little bit, the content of the do shell script command:\n\n\n*\n\n*afinfo doesn't have much in the way of an manual page, so just type afinfo in Terminal and press enter for its options.\n\n*afinfo -r - {-r --real} get the estimated duration after obtaining the real packet count\n\n*Example output of afinfo -r:\n $ afinfo -r '09 Karn Evil 9.mp3'\n File:           09 Karn Evil 9.mp3\n File type ID:   MPG3\n Num Tracks:     1\n----\n Data format:     2 ch,  44100 Hz, '.mp3' (0x00000000) 0 bits/channel, 0 bytes/packet, 1152 frames/packet, 0 bytes/frame\n                    no channel layout.\n audio bytes: 85117515\n audio packets: 81460\n estimated duration: 2127.935 sec\n bit rate: 320000 bits per second\n packet size upper bound: 1052\n maximum packet size: 1045\n audio data file offset: 275530\n optimized\n----\n $\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The above output gets piped (|) to awk.\n\n\n*awk '/estimated duration:/{print int($3/60)}'\n\n\n*\n\n*awk finds the record (line) containing estimated duration: in the output of afinfo piped to it and prints the third field, $3, 2127.935 as an integer, having been divided by 60 to get the number of minutes, as the time value is in seconds. In the example output, awk returned: 35\n\n\n*$(...)

Has anyone else experienced this and if so, what did you do to overcome the issue?\nThe passive hub works perfectly when in use in OSX.\n\nA: up for one answer above, plus make sure that the adapter you're using is the right adapter for running the external hard drive's operating system. I had a 2015 MacBook Pro and I was running kali linux on an external hard drive. I was forced to buy the 2017 version since my dad needed a new computer and he wanted the 2015 MacBook I had. I mindlessly just picked out a USB-C to USB adapter, and that adapter worked for reading and transferring files from different hard drives, but when I try booting the kali linux hard drive, it would ask \"which hard drive to boot\" after pressing the option key, but it would end up having a black screen when I chose the kali. I almost deleted the kali linux operating system I had, and all the files in it (repeat/repartition drive, etc) but a light bulb came to my head and prompted me to check the box of that stupid adapter I bought...sure enough, it was only a USB-C to Type A USB. This may not be the same case for you, but my problem was solved when I bought a different adapter for the USB-C connection for the 2017 Mac. \n\nA: I purchased one of these USB to USB-C adapters from Amazon. This solved the problem. I was able to plug in the thumb drive through the adapter and start the liveCD version of Ubuntu by pressing the option key on reboot and selecting EFI boot. Now the problem will be getting drivers to work for all of the hardware.\n", "Q: How do I hyperlink 'text' within a note in the macOS Notes app?

Not mirroring but dual display.\n\nA: This answer assumes you're asking about the model still currently available, as the MacBook Air hasn't been upgraded since early 2015 (9 March 2015 to be exact), although there was a very minor spec update in June due to a 12.5% increase in the processor's speed. This, however, has no impact on the integrated GPU being used and even Apple's website does not list this as a \"new\" model.\nOriginally this model was only rated by Apple as supporting a single external display of up to 2,560 x 1,600 pixels. However, it was found to actually support Ultra HD (i.e. 4K) resolutions of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels and Apple officially revised their specs. \nMost resources (including everymac.com) imply that the MBA only supports a single external display. However, this is not strictly the case, so long as you're using Thunderbolt displays.\nAccording to Apple:\n\nThese Thunderbolt-capable Mac computers can support up to two connected Apple Thunderbolt Displays:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*MacBook Pro (2011 and later)\n  \n*MacBook Air (Mid 2012) and later\n  \n*iMac (2011 and later)\n  \n*Mac mini (2011 and later)\n  \n\nSource: About Thunderbolt ports and displays \nSo, you can use two Thunderbolt displays with a MacBook Air, but you will need to daisy chain them. Note this applies to all models of MBA from Mid-2012 and later. In some cases users have had to do this by, for example, connecting a Thunderbolt display directly to the MBA and then connecting another powered Thunderbolt device (e.g. a Thunderbolt drive) to the display, and then connecting your second Thunderbolt display to the Thunderbolt drive.\nOther options\nI have seen setups in which users have connected one Thunderbolt display directly to the MBA's Thunderbolt port and a second DVI display via a USB-DVI adapter. Some seem to work quite well, others not so much. If your intention is to just do some word-processing and browsing, this'd be fine, but if you wanted to use the display for more intensive tasks, I would not go this route.\n", "Q: Where are texts from an email address stored? When I use my iPhone to send a message under an email address rather than my phone number, where is that message recorded as sent? It does not show up in usage logs the way text messages do, nor under 'sent' in gmail, for example. \nIs there a record of it? If so, where?\n\nA: All messages sent via the iOS Messages app are stored within the app. However, messages sent to and from email addresses are stored in their own message thread. I'll try and explain this with an example below:\nEXAMPLE\nLet's say you have a contact whose name is Jane Doe. You have a mobile number and an email address for her. Usually you send messages to her mobile number and you have a long history of messages going back five years, all of which you can view via the Messages app. However, one day you accidentally send her a message to her email address instead. This message is not stored with all the other messages, it is stored under a second thread for Jane Doe, containing only the history of messages sent to or received from Jane's email address.\nUsing the example above, since both the email address and mobile number are stored in Jane Doe's contact details, you can go to the Messages app and in the search field at the very top, type in \"Jane Doe\". This will filter your message threads and you should see both of them listed separately. From these you can see all messages sent and received.\nIf, on the other hand, you had sent a message directly to an email address that isn't stored in your contacts, then the message thread is stored under the email address rather than a person's name. So, if Jane Doe's email address is jane.doe@email.com and you didn't have this in her contact details, then the message thread would be listed under jane.doe@email.com rather than Jane Doe.\n", "Q: Port Knocking on macOS Sierra Does anyone know how to get Port Knocking work on macOS Sierra.

I have a Linux machine which I'd like to use as a NAS backup, so I'm following this blog post by Sam Hewitt. \nMy MacBook's drives are not encrypted with FileVault, and I'm on El Capitan 10.11.5. I am wondering how encryption works when data is backed up to a NAS Time Machine backup. More specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I select the \"Encrypt Backups\" options in Time Machine Prefs, will my backup be encrypted before being transferred over my network? \n\n*Is the transfer protocol used by Time Machine secure? \n\n*Will backups on my remote NAS always be encrypted, unreadable by anyone who can somehow access the machine?\n\n\nA: First, a warning: unsupported backup targets are unsupported for a reason. I don't know the details, but apparently there's some special sauce (or at least a newer version of the AFP protocol) needed on the server to cleanly handle things like getting disconnected partway through a backup. As a result, backups to unsupported network servers seem to get corrupted more than they should, which isn't good for a backup system.\nNow about security: the backup is stored on the server in the form of an encrypted disk image (in sparse bundle format). The image is mounted on the client (your computer), which means that the encryption/decryption takes place on the client, and all that goes over the network (and is seen / stored by the server) is encrypted blocks of the image.\nTo answer your questions directly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, the backup is encrypted before being sent to the server.\n\n*No, the AFP protocol is not particularly secure, but it doesn't matter because the data being transferred over AFP is encrypted.\n\n*Yes, the TM data on the NAS is encrypted.\n\n\nBTW, be sure to store your backup password somewhere safe -- If your HD dies, and you don't remember the backup encryption password, there'll be no way to get your data back.\n", "Q: How to get the Reset Password mac OS notification to disappear I recently reset my Apple ID the other day, and ever since my Mac always prompts me with a notification to reset my password from my device.

After updating to Mac OS X 10.12.4 I found I could no longer connect on the custom port - instead it was listening on port 22.  I found that my sshd_config had apparently been renamed to sshd_config~previous, so I moved it back to the correct spot and restarted sshd from the command line using sudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd; sudo launchctl start com.openssh.sshd.  However, after the restart sshd was still listening on port 22.  I then opened System Preferences and under sharing clicked on \"Remote Login\".  Running `netstat -a -n\" showed that port 22 was no longer being listened to.  I then click on \"Remote Login\" to restart sshd, and then found sshd was still listening on port 22, not my custom port.\nIn /var/log/apache2 I see an empty access_log on startup, and error_log contains the normal startup message.  No clues there.\nHow do I get sshd to listen on my custom port again?\n\nA: I found the answer here and it appears to also apply for upgrading to Sierra from a pre-el capitan version of OS X.\nTo summarize:\nsudo cp /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist\n\nEdit /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist and change the lines that read:\n<key>Label</key>\n<string>com.openssh.sshd</string>\n\nto:\n<key>Label</key>\n<string>com.openssh.sshd2</string>\n\nAnd change the lines that read:\n<key>SockServiceName</key>\n<string>ssh</string>\n\nby replacing \"ssh\" with whatever port you want to use.\nThen start the new port with:\nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist\n\nAs noted in the article, this doesn't eliminate ssh running on port 22.  In my case that was okay - the main reason for running on the new port was to match the port ssh was visible at outside the firewall.\n", "Q: Internet speeds don't add I am downloading two files from Internet.

Below is the screenshot of downloading in the browser and the activity monitor:\n\nPlease guide me; what can be wrong here? Maybe my knowledge is not accurate about this.\nI am using macOS Sierra 10.12.4.\n\nA: There is nothing wrong here.\nCyberduck & LibreOffice downloads are displaying their average speed since the beginning of the real download operation.\nActivity Monitor is displaying an instantaneous speed which will take into account these 2 downloads, but also all the background network traffic your Mac is always doing (ex.: netbios, Bonjour, ntp). This instantaneous speed is highly variable and depend mostly of this background network traffic.\n\nA: You cannot do the comparison you're trying to do as you are comparing apples and pears.\nIt seems like you're comparing apples and apples because the units are the same - i.e. you're comparing kB/s with kB/s. \nHowever in reality data packets on a network are not sent as a continuous stream that can be instantaneously measured as a specific kB/s. In practice programs will measure the amount of data sent over a period of time and calculate an average, which is what is displayed.\nAs different programs can select difference periods of time to average over - you cannot compare the numbers the way you're doing.\n", "Q: What's the purpose of ~/Library/Containers? I wonder what's the purpose of ~/Library/Containers?\nI know that under ~/Library/Preferences you can find user specific app  and system configuration plists. But I can also find them in ~/Library/Containers.\nWhat kind of configuration is stored there?\n\nA: ~/Library/Containers contain the home directories of sandboxed apps.\nSandboxed apps are for example the apps you download from the Mac App Store. Sandboxing means that they are \"isolated\" from the rest of the system, so that a single app is not able to do unjust harm to other parts of the system.\nTherefore sandboxed apps are normally not allowed to just write to any file system path they want. In order to support writing to standard paths without having to rewrite the apps, the system will create a Container folder that the sandboxed app can write into. The sandboxed app thinks it is writing into a system folder for preferences for example - but the system rewrites the path so that it ends up in the Container folder instead.\nFor example many apps wrote their data to ~/Library/Application Support/. A sandboxed app cannot do that - and the data is instead written beneath the ~/Library/Containers/ path for that app.\n", "Q: Which upgrade should I consider for my usage: RAM or CPU? I plan to buy the new 2017 13\" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for the new semester. However, I'm trying to decide between upgrading the RAM or the CPU. \nI'm currently a Math major and plan to use it for things involving maths operations, like running Mathematica, factoring really big primes, graphing 3D contour plots etc. I'm also a bit of a gamer. Another consideration is that I really don't want the computer heating up, as I currently have the fan-less 2015 Retina MacBook and overheating is a common issue.\nWith this specific usage in mind, I'm really wondering what would benefit me the most: upgrading to the i7 processor or increasing the RAM to 16GB? \n\nA: For starters, many users pay too much attention to overheating. Macs are designed to operate at a range of temperatures and to automatically protect themselves if they sense the temperature is above a safe level.\nSecondly, you may get differences in opinion, but I'll try my best to answer this with facts.\nWhile some i7 CPUs are quad-core, the ones offered on the 13\" MBP are dual-core processors, just like the i5 CPUs.\nSince all dual core i5 and i7 mobile processors support hyper-threading, there's actually very little difference between them in terms of a performance gap and battery usage. In fact, both options for this model also incorporate the same Intel Iris Plus Graphics GPU. \nMy personal recommendation would be to upgrade both if you can find a way to afford it, as this will increase it's longevity in terms of future compatibility with software/hardware.\nHowever, if you had to pick and choose what you upgraded, then the upgrade to 16GB RAM would be the most beneficial, as the performance boost on the i7 will benefit you less than the extra RAM would.\n\nA: The i7 processor for the 2017 13\" MacBook Pro is still \"just\" a dual-core, which is not going to be the ideal MacBook for working with very CPU intensive apps. The base model 2017 15\" MacBook Pro has a quad-core i7 processor, which would be more suited to your needs.\nSince you're a gamer, getting the 15\" model would also make a lot of sense, since you're getting the Radeon Pro 555 graphics card, which will perform noticeably better than the Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650. The 15\" MacBook also has a different cooling solution than the 13\" MacBook, which should help with alleviating any temperature problems.\nIn regards to the RAM question, it depends on how much RAM you usually use, which you can find out by opening the Activity Monitor app nd having a look at the Memory tab. RAM is also less important than it has been in previous generations, since caching to SSDs has become much faster due to the very fast SSDs that are included in the new MacBooks. However, more RAM would certainly help with future proofing your purchase.\nHowever, the 15\" at $2,399 is $400 more expensive than the 13\" inch at $1,999 -  which of course is also a factor to consider, although you can receive a student discount on the MacBooks through the Apple Store.\nIf you really need the 13\" form factor, I would suggest getting the i7 processor, because of what I perceive as your need for more computational power than RAM.\nI have the new non Touch Bar 2017 13\" MacBook Pro with the 256GB SSD, but I can still get the fans going fairly fast and have it heat up, by just browsing and having a video running in the background. So I believe you will run into very high CPU temperatures doing computational work on the 13\" MacBook.\n", "Q: How to know whether Mac has SSD or HDD installed How do I know whether my Mac has a SSD or HDD installed without having to literally open my Mac?\nPS.

So I have various command line tools like node, stats, etc which help me with day to day tasks, however I've noticed they don't show up in storage manager under applications and am unsure if there's a way to list all of those tools and completely remove all the files of the ones I don't use any more. It'll show as extra system memory use. It's not a big deal however I don't want to waste space. Is there a tool to manage all of this?\n\nA: Basically every directory listed in PATH besides the standard ones (/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin) contains user-installed, so running ls on these directories gives you the list for them and you can use the usual Unix tools like du to calculate sizes. \nTo make managing user-installed tools easier you can rely on a package manager. Homebrew is the package manager of choice for many users.\n\nA: You should also look at the manual page for hier, as it provides a historical sketch of the filesystem hierarchy, which you might find informational in reference to your question. You can run ls in Terminal on any of directories listed, to get a listing, or look at them through Finder > Go > Go to Folder... and type in the path, e.g.: /usr/bin\n", "Q: Found a socket called \"chaos_control\" in my home directory, what is it? I did an ls in my home directory and along with my normal folders it listed a file called chaos_control. It does not show up in Finder even when I show hidden files. \nI ran file chaos_control and it returned that the file is a socket. What does this mean and should I be worried? I did not notice it before today. It is not related to the productivity app \"Chaos Control\" I found on Google; I have never had that installed on my system.\n\nIf I run open -e chaos_control I get this error:\n\n\nmdls returns chaos_control: could not find chaos_control.\n\nls -l returns this:\nsrwxr-xr-x  1 chris  staff  0 Jan 24  2016 chaos_control\n\nOpening the file in vim yields \"chaos_control\" [Permission Denied], even with sudo.\n\nRunning lsof on this socket does nothing, no processes are using it.\n\nA: If you look at the output from \"ls -l\" you see that the first letter is an \"s\". This means that the file is not really a physical file on disk, but is instead a \"socket link\".\nA \"socket link\" is not the socket itself, but as the name suggest merely a link. It is used when two processes running on your computer want to communicate. In order to \"find each other\" they use the socket link in the file system. Both programs open that and they can exchange messages.\nYou cannot use the \"open\" command to open a socket link, as it is not really a disk file and it doesn't make any sense to open it in for example TextEdit.app. Similarly opening it with \"vim\" does not make any sense either.\nHaving a socket link is in itself not a \"bad thing\", if this is your worry. It doesn't really take up much space on disk - and it's only a link, not a socket in itself. So if you close the communicating processes (or for example reboot the Mac) - the socket will automatically be closed.\nAny (non-sandboxed) program could potentially create a socket link named chaos_control. So it is not possible conclusively to say which program created it by looking at the file name.\nAs it has been created a year and a half ago, it is plausible that you did some action that caused this file to be created. For example when using a new program that you aren't using anymore.\nYou can just delete the socket link (use the \"rm\" command) and it is gone. However there's no real risk or disadvantage in having it around except that it shows up in folder listings.\n", "Q: How can I export all calendar entries from iCloud?

The entries show up properly in my iDevices and macOS Calendar.app.\n\nA: Found a workaround for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the calendar public in iCloud\n\n*Open the Calendar.app on an iOS device\n\n*Tap the Calendars button on the bottom and then the i on the calendar you want to share\n\n*Tap the Share Link... button and send the link to yourself somehow\n\n\nFor some reason this link works fine, but the one from https://icloud.com doesn't.\n", "Q: Error during install of lzip on MacOS 10.11.6 This is probably overly obvious but I am stuck.

Likewise, there used to be an option in 10.8 to restart the Mac if it froze, so presumably the system also knows when it is going to lock up. \nWhy does one happen vs the other?\n\nA: Panic is a guaranteed, deterministic dead end. The code literally cannot continue so the conditions that led up to it are documented (as well as they can on a system that is already broken) and aborts.\nHangs can be all manner of thing so the generalization is less possible or convenient to make.\nOne library of buggy program can cause both - so that’s a clue you might be able leverage in your investigation.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is a Kernel Panic and what does it mean?\n\n*How can I troubleshoot Kernel Panics on my iMac\n\n*How serious are occasional kernel panics?\nSince the panics have more diagnostic information and are more certain, I’d start with debugging and cornering those. For the hangs, you’ll need to trigger sysdiagnose and look over log files and collect the data and timing manually. \n", "Q: iPhone Trojan Attack Warning I opened an internet radio app, HiDef Radio, that I have used before, many times, on my iPhone 4s with iOS 9.3. After connecting to a station and listening a short while, a window popped open saying:\n\nApple Security\n  Attention!!\n(6) virus detected on your iPhone!\n  IP address 108.72.0.216 (not my iPhone's IP address)\n  One of the last sites you've visited contained a Trojan, loading via the vulnerabilities of the browser.\nClick ok to start the cleaning process. After clean up, make sure to upgrade your system to the latest version.\nInstall        Cancel\nDetected by Apple Firewall Ver 6.2.7\n\nClicking the Cancel button took my to the App Store for a VPN program, HotSpot Shield Free VPN Proxy which, as it turns out, I already have on my iPhone! But it was not running (and is not now, either) when the popup window appeared.\nSo what does all this mean? Obviously the popup is fake, there is no Firewall on iOS, the IP address is wrong, etc.\nIs AnchorFree (makers of HotSpot) resorting to scare tactics to push their product?\nIs the HiDef Radio app compromised?\n\nA: These popups are completely and totally FAKE. All they're meant to do is prey upon your fears as a user. (tl;dr at the bottom)\nMost app advertisements are networked, meaning the developer adds a little bit of code to their app, sets what kind of ads they want, and the network lets people buy ad slots. Sketchy ads (like these) pay a lot more, since they're banned from many networks and only some apps allow them (that's usually configurable).\nThese app advertisements are usually implemented as a custom WebView that only closes once the X appears after a few seconds. As you can see here, these ads also appear in safari, where you have to close the page, and cancel can do whatever the designers want it to do:\n\nA lot of this style of ad also reference the \"adult sites you've visited\" hoping you won't turn to technical support or the Internet for help.\nIn reference to you saying that this was made by AnchorFree, that's highly likely. It's an easy (and sadly, effective) way of pushing their product to get more subscribers. Clicking download would've most likely taken you to the HotspotShield install page as well. Your HiDef radio app is probably fine.\ntl;dr: your phone is fine, the ad is fake, and AnchorFree probably paid for it. The HiDef radio app is also fine.\nPS: I'd be careful about the VPN apps you use, since some will sell your data that they gather through the tunnel they make to advertisers and other people. Read the privacy policy!\n\nA: I had the same problem with one of our iPhone users and I'd recommend restoring the phone to factory but before doing that review what apps you have installed.\n\n\nA: No, more likely the \"Free VPN\" app is a trojan.  Remove it.\n\nA: I received this identical (except IP is different) pop up today on iPhone 6 (iOS 10.3.2). \nI do not have HiDef Radio or FreeVPN installed (nor have I ever visited HiDefRadio site).\nI my case, it seems to be related to Words with Friends app.\nI did NOT click \"Install\".\nNote: clicking \"Cancel\" did NOT take me to App Store. It just closed the pop up.\nSeveral other sites discuss how to remove it (this pop up)\n", "Q: Changing my Apple-Id's nationality Not many years ago, there was quite a difference between accounts from different countries when it came to apps and music available for purchase. Nowadays I don't really see that difference, so I wish to change my AppleId's nationality. Is that possible? Will my purchased apps and music be kept with the new nationality?\n\nA: The App Store purchased items are tied to Apple ID per country.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have an Apple ID under registered under my.appleid@icloud.com in US, everything you’ve purchased is only available when you’ve switched to US App Store.\n\n*If you use the same Apple ID and switch country to Hong Kong, you won’t be able to download all the apps and musics you’ve purchased in US App Store unless you switch back to US App Store first.\n\n*You can, however, download the apps from the US App Store before switching to HK App Store where you can buy an apps from the there separately.

My late wife had a HUGE collection of Vinyl and more than a few CDs.  I had some of each myself.\nNow I'm retired and traveling, so I'm putting them all in iTunes.  The CDs mostly imported with all the proper tags.   Vinyl copied from a USB turntable to MP3 files did not, because iTunes only checks Gracenotes when importing CDs.  Audio CDs made from the ripped files occasionally matched but usually didn't.\nTidy up iTunes library? and items linked from it gave me several suggestions for tools to try.  None of them worked.  They couldn't even match files imported from legal commercial CDs that iTunes had already correctly matched.  This is, I imagine, since most \"fingerprinting\" algorithms depend more on the way the tracks are assembled than the actual music in each file.  (Yet I remember, some time ago, advertisements for apps/services that allegedly allowed a smart phone to identify a song from the audio picked up by the microphone.)\nIn almost all of my cases, however, I already know which album it is, so what I would really like is a tool that will let me tell it a group of files and some sort of ID or URI of the album in Discogs/CDDB/Gracenotes/MusicBrainz/etc. and have it add or correct all the tags (so I don't have to type them all in one at a time.\nBonus if it can also download cover art.

I have deleted my iTunes application (using a terminal command) several times already and it keeps popping back up. I have to delete it every time it downloads. \nIs there a way to stop iTunes from automatically downloading?\n\nA: To stop iTunes from automatically downloading, you should completely uninstall it from your computer.

Any advice on how to fix this issue or recover these photos?\n\nA: I used to have this problem too. Quickest fix for me was to preview the photos one by one and open the editor for each one.

I tried a few: Photo Booth, Calendar and System Preferences.  They all moved to the new location without any issues, and also functioned after the move. \n\nYou can hide files fairly easily in the Terminal.app:\nsudo chflags hidden \"/Applications/Chess.app\"\n\nto unhide:\nsudo chflags nohidden \"/Applications/Chess.app\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need to enter admin password after entering either one of these commands \n\n*You can drag a file to the Terminal window to get the file path.

If it doesn't appear to be working, you may wanna try adding the double quotes.\n\n\n\nYou don't need to see the file to unhide it, but it does help so you can easily copy the path and you don't need to remember which files are hidden. Seeing hidden files in Finder is a little less intuitive though...\nIf you want to see all hidden files in the system, there are applications where this is a built in feature: TotalFinder, XtraFinder, Path Finder, Commander One...but you can show them in Finder as well, using the Terminal.app:\nShould be noted that both of these commands here will close all finder windows\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall -KILL Finder\n\nAnd to hide all hidden files:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO; killall -KILL Finder\n\n", "Q: I want to use a iTunes voucher but not sure if it will charge my dad's credit card I tried use iTunes voucher but I am not sure if it will charge my dad.

I often use my Mac without its battery to avoid overcharging during long periods of plugged-in use. Could I still reset the SMC by skipping the battery removal step and just unplugging the MagSafe adapter and holding the power button for 5 ~ 10 seconds?\n\nA: \nI often use my Mac without its battery to avoid overcharging during\n  long periods of plugged-in use.\n\n(Why is this even a thing?)  The SMC that you are attempting to reset manages the flow of current to/from the battery to ensure that it's not overcharged.  There's dedicated charging circuitry specifically for the task of safely charging your battery.\nAdditionally, all modern battery packs have over/under charge protection circuitry built into them.  So, removing your battery \"during extended period of plugged-in use\" is completely unnecessary and you risk damaging things if your battery is the non-removable type (those connectors weren't designed for repeated connects/disconnects).\nTo answer your question...\n\nCould I still reset the SMC by skipping the battery removal step and\n  just unplugging the MagSafe adapter and holding the power button for 5\n  ~ 10 seconds?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If your battery is removable - this would be a moot point given that you're supposed to remove it.  Reset the SMC and plug the battery back in.\n\n*If your battery is non-removable, plug the battery back in and reset the SMC. Leave the battery plugged in.\nThere are reasons to reset the SMC and this shouldn't be done in the course of \"normal maintenance.\"  Too many times folks react to common errors with \"I need to reset the SMC/NVRAM) - this is hardly the case.  Please see Apple's support page:  Reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac for more information on Indicators that the SMC might need to be reset.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have Apple update RAM in current Mac mini (Late 2014) Is it possible to send my Mac mini (current version) back to Apple and get them fit more RAM into it? \nWith the old models i could add RAM into them, but as I understand on the new current model Mac minis it's not user upgradeable.\n\nA: Short answer:  No.\nApple is not going to retrofit memory into any Mac (Mac mini, MacBook, etc.) if you want to upgrade.  They don't even make simple repairs to their logic boards - they will just replace them.   \nIf you require more memory, you will need to \n\n\n*\n\n*replace the logic board\n\n*purchase an entirely new unit\n\n\nWhile I typically would purchase a machine (Apple, Dell, Lenovo, etc.) with the highest CPU and lowest memory and drive specs, this has now become impossible since RAM is now commonly soldered on and in the case of Apple, their SSDs are proprietary.\nBuy the machine with the specs you think you will need in the future, not for what you need now.\n", "Q: 3 monitors on a Mac Mini (Mid 2012) I would like to have three screens connected to my Mac Mini, so far I have one screen connected via HDMI and one screen connected via thunderbolt. The only ports I have left are USB and firewire, would there be any way for me to connect a third monitor?\n\nA: For the 3rd monitor you'll need an HDMI to USB converter but make sure that the converter is Mac compatible, if it isn't I'm not 100% sure but you may be able to find a software to make it mac compatible with the type of converter like I did.\n", "Q: Show/Hide only specific hard drives on desktop and/or sidebar Is it possible to show only specific hard drives on the desktop?

Can I put the El Cap boot drive on the desktop somehow, but leave off the legacy drive?  Does not seem possible in the GUI, or by directly writing to the com.apple.finder plist.  Anyone have any tricks?\n\nA: You can use the chflags command to hide a drive icon from the desktop:\nchflags hidden /Volumes/Hide\\ Me\n\nThen, relaunch the Finder by option-right-clicking it in the Dock and choosing Relaunch.\nTo restore visibility of an item, use chflags nohidden instead.\nOf note, this won't hide the icon from the sidebar, only from the desktop and Finder folder listings.\n\nA: chflags will cause issues in Mojave and higher (even after enabling Full Disk Access).

Mac: System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced -> Proxies -> Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts & Domains: \"captive.apple.com\"\nShould this address be bypassed? My guess is that TunnelBear VPN may have put this there as they mess with proxy settings.\n\nA: This relates to how Apple logs into WiFi, particularly the free or public WiFi you find in many places.  Many of these networks want you to agree to terms/conditions, sign-on, pay for service, etc.  They intercept all Web requests and divert you to the agree/login/pay page.  Apple tries very hard to automatically detect this, and turn their login page into a \"pop-up\" with a \"Cancel\" button.  When you succeed, it changes the button to \"Done\". \nHow does it do this?  By attempting to send traffic to captive.apple.com.   If the traffic makes it through, it knows the WiFi channel has granted you access, and changes the button to \"Done\".\nIf you were to proxy that, it wouldn't work. \n", "Q: Is there good software for recovering photos from an iphone data My iPhone is in recovery mode and I want to recover some photos.

So I checked the big files in the system. However I don't want to mess with system files as I don't know anything about them.

I prefer to delete files manually rather than using any app but if there's any simple no frills utility app which works, I'll happily use that. \n\nA: Honestly delete nothing in those directories manually. You'll likely crash your system if it even lets you delete them. Stick with files in \"userland.\" which would be at the path /Users/[YOURUSERNAME]/.\"\nIf you are running out of disk space (which is completely different from running out of memory) I would use a gui tool like Grand Perspective and then delete the files that you no longer need that occupy locations in your user directory.\nI'm sure there are shell commands to list, recursively, files in specific directories in order of file size, but I don't know how to do that, preferring GUI tools that do the same thing.\nIf you are running out of memory in your MBA then the only choice you have (as all MBA memory is non-upgradable) is to see if you have a bunch of things running at startup (system preferences > users > [YOUR USERNAME] > login items) and remove some of them or just run fewer apps at the same time.\n\nA: The sleepimage file can safely be deleted by the user. It will be recreated the next time the Mac is put to sleep due to a default setting which can be disabled. This page at TechRadar shows how to delete the sleepimage file, as well as how to disable the recreation of the file.\nThe sleepimage file is a snapshot of the contents of RAM taken just before the Mac is put to sleep. When the Mac is awakened, this file is used to recreate the RAM contents, ostensibly to make the process quicker.\nSwapfiles will always be created, and there's little you can do other than increasing the amount of physical RAM in your Mac.\nPlease edit your question to indicate if you are asking about RAM usage, or if you are getting Startup Disk is Almost Full messages.\n\nA: I suggest you get a tool like CleanMyMac that is very efficient in this situation.

That means it's not possible to upgrade it to iOS 6 (or higher). You'll have to buy another one. Even if it would run iOS 6, it would be terribly slow. Modern apps are developed with way more memory and CPU power in mind.\n\nA: You can't. Apple decided to leave the 1st generation iPad on iOS 5.1.1, yet update the iPod touch 4th generation, which shares specs with the iPad, to iOS 6. But just because you're not able to normally, doesn't mean it isn't possible. iOS 7 was ported over to the 4th gen iPod touch despite being left on iOS 6.1.6, so you shouldn't give up yet.\n", "Q: Open a large XML file I am trying to open a relatively large XML file (50mb) but my Mac just won't open it: No errors though, just been waiting for almost 10 minutes but nothing happens.\nTried using TextEditor, Xcode\nAny other suggestions? \n\nA: Depending on the source of the file, you may wish to investigate its contents in other ways than just opening it (double clicking).  For this, you should use the command line.\nSome suggested starting points (where \"whatever.xml\" is the name of the file):\nfile whatever.xml\n\nThis will tell you what type the file is.  Not by file extension, but by actual examination of the contents.\nhead whatever.xml\n\nThis will show you the first ten lines of the file.  However, be warned: It is possible to have an entire 50 MB XML file consisting of a single line.  Press Ctrl-C to stop if it starts spewing garbage.  (Yes, Control C, not Command-C.)\nTo just view the file without even the possibility of editing it:\nless whatever.xml\n\nIf the file does consist of very long lines, for reading it, you could force periodic line wraps (formatting):\nfmt whatever.xml | less\n\nBut actually, less will wrap the lines by default unless you tell it not to.  For no wrapping of lines (so you can use sideways arrow keys to scroll):\nless -S whatever.xml\n\n\nIt is a good probability that one of these commands will disclose a problem with the file.\n\nA: My goto editor for large files is BBEdit. I've opened much larger files (200MB+ log files) without any slowdown. I've even used it to open binary files in order to look for ascii strings. If BBEdit can't open it, nothing can.\n\nA: I use Sublime Text 3 to do some of my editing. A very nice and fairly fast programmable (with plugins) editor. I've just tried it on a 50 mb text file and it didn't seem to have a problem. Sublime Text 3 is not free but their free trial period seems to be endless. While I was checking Sublime Text I tried Atom too. Atom was slower at loading but once it got loaded it seemed fine.\n\nA: Try Sublime Text or Atom to open your XML file.\n\nA: If you just want to open it (not edit), try xmllint command in Terminal:\nxmllint --format ~/Desktop/file.xml\n\nThere's man page for xmllint command line tool: Go here\n\nA: Working with bigger XML files I suggest to give it a try to Oxygen XML Editor or Sublime Text.\nWhile the first is my editor of choice for its versatility it is also quite heavy. If you just have to go for an easy reading or searching & replacing, it can be done in Sublime Text 3. It takes its time but it doesn't crash.\nAll the others editor I tried were not able to open the file (I am talking about bigger xml files, >200MB), or they took ages. Moreover, both Oxygen and Sublime provide you with the code highlighting option (in case you are dealing with RDF languages for example...).\nHope it helps\n", "Q: I can't update apps with new Apple ID I used to have an old Apple ID, and I have a specific paid app I purchased with that ID. I now have a new Apple ID, and I wanted to update the paid app from the old Apple ID with the new Apple ID. \nI am wondering if I deleted the app, would it show up as \"purchased\" on my new Apple ID?\n\nA: No - purchases are not transferable, but you could set up your new account as family share and if the purchases are eligible for sharing, you would then get to use the new appleID and password to download for free the \"purchase\" from the 'family member\"\n\nA: If the app was purchased under the old Apple ID, it's considered \"owned by\" that Apple ID. Updates, redownloads, etc must be done under that Apple ID. There is no way to transfer ownership to a different Apple ID. The only option you have to get it \"owned by\" your new Apple ID is to delete it, and then re-purchase it under your new Apple ID (and yes, this does mean paying for it again, along with any in-app purchases). Sorry about that...\n", "Q: Where is history stored with Safari 10.1 under OS10.11? Everyone else is worried about clearing all records, but I spent more than a year setting up all the tabs that I want open for my work. After an institutionally mandated \"upgrade\", numerous programs failed to function and I got remote help that resolved most of those problems. Unfortunately, the remote Tech closed and re-opened Safari without doing a \"Restore Previous Session\" and then closed it, again. Short of painstakingly pouring over thousands of websites that I have visited over the past 12 - 18 months, perhaps I can find where Safari stored \"Restore Last Session\" history file I need within Time Machine.\nAny suggestions? I looked in ~Library//Caches/Metadata/Safari and found thousands of websites, but no \"Restore Last Session\"\n\nA: First, close Safari, then enter Time Machine from /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Safari/.\nNext, restore the LastSession.plist file.\nThen reopen Safari and then you can \"Reopen All Windows from Last Session\" in the History menu.\n\nA: I think the thing you are looking for is called \"Saved Application State\". For Safari you can find it at /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Safari.savedState.\nIf you close Safari, then copy the content of that folder (it should be three files I think) from a known good Time Machine backup into the current version of the folder, that should restore your tabs.\n", "Q: Attempt to copy a file denied by permissions, but why? I have a folder which I wish to copy from my Macbook Air (OSX 10.10.5) onto a USB attached hard disk.  When I try to copy the folder, some files are copied, then the copy aborts with the message: The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to access “PT3 Summary and Comments SM358 TMA01.htm”.  If I just copy that file alone, I am asked to enter my password, and then the file is copied successfully.\nThe permissions for (me) are read/write for the file, and for the source and target folders.  Any idea why I can't copy the whole folder?\n\nA: This problem may occur because of wrong ownership. Try to run following command to change ownership for your user:\nsudo chown -R $(id -un):$(id -gn) path_to_your_directory\n\nIn this example, sudo will give you needed permissions to perform operation, chown is a command to change ownership, -R will make operation recursive against target folder, $(id -un) is your current user name $(id -gn) is your current group name, path_to_your_directory shold be a path to folder you want to fix ownership.\n", "Q: Folders in Apple Notes app How do you determine what folder a note resides in, in the Notes app? I have about 20 folders and put 30 or so notes in many folders.\nAll databases use to have some way to view a path.\n\nA: It does depends on what iOS device you are using but generally\nThe title above all the notes in that folder indicates the folder name, as shown in the picture.\nIf you are editing inside the note on an iPhone for instance, the back button is titled with the folder name.\n\n", "Q: iPhone 6 low on storage and becoming non-functional I have a 64gb iPhone 6. I've been butting up to my local storage limit for a while now but yesterday all my photos disappeared and most of not all of the apps on the phone no longer open. I've deleted several very large apps, but every time I do the available storage only goes up temporarily before getting very low again. I've been able to open a couple apps now but still no photos (the app never even opens). I've tried syncing to computer but it doesn't recognize any photos on the device. This happened once this summer but only lasted for a few hours. This is well past the 24 hour mark. I would prefer to back up the photos before going the nuclear option of restoring it. Any ideas of what I could try would be appreciated? \n\nA: I am assuming here that you have synced your phone to a Mac or PC and continue to do so? If so and you have the options in iTunes checked to sync photos (on a Mac it would be photos.app and on Windows it is usually a folder in your Pictures folder) you should be able to verify that they are on your computer.\nOnce you have found your missing photos and verified all you need is safely on your computer I would do a wipe and restore. That cleans out temporary/cached files and files left over from deleted apps and the like. To be safe I would make another backup of your phone on your local computer. And I would password protect the backup so it preserves any passwords saved on your phone. Once that is done...\nOn the phone it is in Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content And Settings.\nErase the phone and then restore it from the backup you just made. That, in itself, may clear enough space on your phone to help the issue. If not you may have to remove some apps, music or photos to clear more space.\n", "Q: How to add a shortcut to open a new finder window to the Launchpad or dock What I want: A one-click action in the dock or launchpad that opens the downloads folder in a new finder window. \nNote: the Downloads \"fan\" thing that is in the left side area of the dock is not what I want. When I click that it opens a weird list / grid / fan thing of the stuff in my downloads folder, and then I have to click some more to actually open a finder window. Nope. I want a one click icon in the dock or launchpad. \nAdditionally: the icon needs to be the Downloads folder icon, if at all possible. \n\nA: Copy this script to a new ScriptEditor document.

Select the icon of the downloads folder and “Edit/Copy” Select the icon of the new application and “”Edit/Paste”.\n\nDrag your new application down to your dock and you are good to go.\n\nA: Another way to get what you're asking for, also done as an AppleScript application, but being able to customize the properties of the window.\nIn Script Editor, create a new document and add the following AppleScript code as an example:\nset theTarget to (path to downloads folder as string)\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theWindow to make new Finder window to folder theTarget\n    tell theWindow to set {current view, toolbar visible, bounds} to {list view, true, {0, 23, 1024, 512}}\n    activate\nend tell\n\nYou can modify the properties to your liking in the tell theWindow to set line of code  to whatever you'd like of the available properties.\nTo get the properties, you can open a Finder window to your downloads folder, arrange it how you'd like to appear every time and then use the following in a separate AppleScript document to get it's properties to use in the app that opens it:\ntell application \"Finder\" to get properties of windows \"Downloads\"\n\nThe above command returns the following example output:\n\n{class:Finder window, id:1004, name:\"Downloads\", position:{0, 23},\n  bounds:{0, 23, 1024, 512}, index:1, zoomed:false, closeable:true,\n  titled:true, floating:false, modal:false, resizable:true,\n  zoomable:true, visible:true, collapsed:false, target:folder\n  \"Downloads\" of folder \"me\" of folder \"Users\" of startup disk of\n  application \"Finder\", current view:list view, icon view options:icon\n  view options of Finder window id 1004 of application \"Finder\", list\n  view options:list view options of Finder window id 1004 of application\n  \"Finder\", column view options:column view options of Finder window id\n  1004 of application \"Finder\", toolbar visible:true, statusbar\n  visible:true, sidebar width:213}\n\nDoing it this way, you get a new Finder window opened to your Downloads folder set exactly how you want it, based on available properties.\nSee wch1zpink's answer for assigning the Downloads folder icon to the AppleScript application's icon.\n", "Q: Is low power mode in iOS good for battery? Is always keeping 'low powered mode' on iPhone SE, running iOS 10.2.1 , good for battery health?\n\nA: Depends on what you mean by 'health.' If you mean time before you need to recharge, then yes - by reducing the background services, the battery will last longer until you need to recharge it. If you are really strapped for energy, turning on airplane mode or just shutting the phone off entirely until you absolutely need to use it.\nHowever, if by 'health', you mean the number of charge cycles the battery will last, that should remain unaffected. \n\nA: \nLow Power Mode reduces the amount of power that your iPhone uses when the battery gets low.\nWhen Low Power Mode is on, your iPhone will last longer before you need to charge it, but some features might take longer to update or complete.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT205234\n\nA: It does not affect the battery health. According to apple, low power mode simply removes some unnecessary features for a longer battery life.\n", "Q: Using Lightning headphones in my Dell laptop I have an iPhone 7 with Lightning headphones. I got a connecting adapter to use 3.5mm compatible headphones on an iPhone 7. But, is it possible to use these Lightning headphones on the 3.5mm jack of my Dell laptop? I tried Googling and haven't found any converter/adapter.\n\nA: You would need a USB to Lightening adapter for that. The newer Dell laptops do come with USB-C port adapters.\n\nA: The lightning to 3.5mm jack adapter that comes with the iPhone 7 should work with the Dell laptop and the iPhone. That adapter was constructed to work with the standard 3.5mm headphone jack that most devices use. I've yet to see a special 3.5mm jack, just because it was/is an industry standard.\n", "Q: Is it possible to upgrade Mail without upgrading the whole operating system? I have Apple Mail version 9.2, but I would like to have the version 10.3. However, I don't want to download the 10.12 mac OS (Sierra) if I don't have too. I currently have mac OS 10.11.3 (El Capitan).\nThere is a discussion here involving a much older OS (tiger) in 2010:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2502383?tstart=0\nI can't find many other resources discussing upgrading mail.\n\nA: Sorry but my guess would be that this is very unlikely if not impossible.\nMail isn't a single self-contained piece of code like a third-party application. Big chunks of the functionality that make up Mail as stored in frameworks that reside in places like /System/Library/Frameworks for example Message.framework.\nSo as well as the binary that sits in the /Applications folder you'd also need to upgrade any relevant frameworks from the /System/Library/Frameworks folder, and you wouldn't be able to just swap them out because that would break other functionality in the operating system that expected the native El Capitan versions.\nThere is likely a way to do it, but it's such a ridiculously complex task I wouldn't recommend pursuing it.\nSorry.\n", "Q: Is Dashboard on life support? In the past week or so Apple's language translation widget (which uses SYSTRAN for translation) has stopped working, and in searching for a replacement widget I noticed that a lot of former widget developers have now abandoned support for their widgets, citing Apple's lack of support for Dashboard itself.\nAre there any announcements or plans by Apple regarding the future of Dashboard?\n\nUPDATE (2-Aug-2017) - The Translation widget now seems to have been fixed, after a few weeks of being broken. It's not clear whether this was an Apple problem or a SYSTRAN problem. The above question still stands though - does Dashboard have a future ?\n\nUPDATE (2-Nov-2017) - I just upgraded to High Sierra (10.13.1) and while Dashboard is still very much alive, the Translation widget has now completely disappeared !\n\nUPDATE (15-Oct-2019) - With the release of Catalina, the Dashboard is now officially removed from OSX. Mojave (10.14) was the last version of OSX with dashboard support.\n\nA: I'm just speculating here, but...\nIt does seem like apple has left dashboard to die a slow death. I think that we started seeing proof of that, when they introduced a dropdown menu for disabling Dashboard in Mountain Lion (I think). Before that it could be done through the terminal. This was like apple admitting that  people don't really use it that much, so let's give them the option to disable it. \nIn one of the more recent versions of osx, they disabled dashboard by default (Yosemite, maybe?). I'm pretty sure that unless by some miracle there's a dramatic change in how much people use dashboard, Apple is absolutely going to kill it off at some point. \nAt least from the users perspective, it's hard to justify the existence of Dashboard, when we got menubar apps that do essentially the same thing and maybe even a little bit more in some cases. \n\nA possible replacement for that translator widget could be Instant Translate.\n\n\nList of other possible replacements for widgets. \nCalendar: \n\n\n*\n\n*Itsycal (Free)\n\n*Calendar 366\nPlus (~$18)\n\n*Fantastical 2 (~$60) - A full fledged Calendar.app replacement that also has a menubar app.\n\n\nWeather:\n\n\n*\n\n*WeatherBug (Free) \n\n*Forecast Bar (~$6) I could be wrong, but I remember this one having the option to set a notification like say every day at a specific time. When I tried this, I remember setting it to 15:50, 10 minutes before getting off from work. Don't trust me on this though... I can't remember for sure.\n\n\nCalculator\n - You can calculate straight in Spotlight. You can always click the magnifier glass icon on the top right of the screen or use the default shortcut to open Spotlight Cmd+Space. Just write it right there: (20-10)/2. Escape key closes spotlight.\nStickie notes\n\n\n*\n\n*The native app: Stickies.app - There are third party stickie apps, but let's face it, this should be more than enough for most.\n\n*Memo (Free) - I'm only mentioning this, because you can password lock memos, if you want. When you lock a memo, the content becomes hidden. They can also auto lock after a while.\n\n\n\nA few honorable mentions for people who like to customize things like there is no tomorrow.  \niStatmenu has a clock replacement (native menubar clock can be hidden from System\n  Preferences). The clock replacement can be customized pretty much how\n  ever you want. It even has a \"fuzzy clock\", which shows the time in\n  words: twenty past nine. Personally I find that cool, that's why I\n  mentioned it. Anyways, the clock can be clicked to show a calendar\n  (much like those other apps).\nuBar is a Dock replacement that can also show the time and when you hover over it, it shows a very plain calendar. Pretty much just to keep track of what day it is, I'd say.\n  Clicking it opens the native Calendar.app.\nÜbersicht Is very much like some sort of spiritual successor to Dashboard. You can download\n  widgets that show stuff\n  like Weather, Time, Calendar, Disk Space... etc. It's basically an\n  overlay on top of your desktop. You pretty much can't be afraid to\n  dive into some CSS to use this app, because each newly installed widget seems to require\n  you to change poisition, font size and colors.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro kernel panic after speaker change I have recently changed the speakers of my 13\" retina MacBook Pro(Mid 2014, MacOS Sierra) and after few days my Macbook crashed while scanning a document using an HP printer which was connected via USB cable. It was not responding to the power button. I went to apple service center, there they removed the connection of battery from the motherboard. Afer that MacBook started responding to the power button. But it is not working as it used to. It is repeatedly restarting without any warning and display is flickering. \nWhen I start MacBook in Safe Mode it works really well. So, I looked at panic logs.

I did not a find an easy way to do this in Mac OS. So I installed Windows 10 on MacBook Pro without using Bootcamp. I downloaded Bootcamp support software from Apple website. I did not install all drivers from this support software at once. Instead, I installed drivers one by one and verified if it is causing any problem. After hours of investigation, I found out that as soon as Intel Iris Device Driver is installed operating system crashes. To get MacBook working again, I had to find a way in which I could force operating system from loading these device drivers. Even if I do not install these drivers manually, windows would download drivers and install it for me. To make sure windows do not download these drivers, I did three things.\nFirst, I made sure windows will not install drivers for the faulty hardware. \nSecond, I disabled automatic driver download and install.\nThird, I changed my wifi connection to metered.\nNow everything is working.

I got a MacBook Pro 13 inch, mid 2012 version.

The page you referred to is purely hardware and how long you will be able to get replacement parts.\nSoftware updates (i.e. macOS, iOS, Pages, Numbers, etc…) are subject to the hardware limitations and what hardware is needed in order for Apple to support that configuration. For example, my 2012 Mac Mini will run macOS Sierra, but it won't use the Apple Watch to unlock it because the version of BlueTooth in that Mac won't support that feature.\nEvery year when the new OS update is announced there is also the supported hardware list. This year's macOS update (10.13, High Sierra) will support all machines that were supported under last year's update (10.12, Sierra), but last year there were some machines that were not able to be updated from 10.11 to 10.12 (my Mac Pro can run 10.11, but not 10.12 or later).\n", "Q: Having trouble editing Finder settings using defaults write I run the following command:\nsudo defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist ShowHardDrivesOnDesktop -boolean TRUE\n\nin hopes that this will cause system hard drives to show on the desktop, which doesn't happen.

I am looking for a command to toggle the option to show hard drives on the desktop, just as if I checked the box in Finder preferences.\n\nA: First of all you shouldn't need sudo and it may have caused the permissions issue, and no need to use the full pathname, just:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder ShowHardDrivesOnDesktop -boolean TRUE\n\nThe following works for me, as is, in OS X 10.8.5 and macOS 10.12.5 in both a Standard and Admin Account in Terminal.\ndefaults write com.apple.finder ShowHardDrivesOnDesktop -boolean TRUE; killall Finder\n\nUsing FALSE, in place of TRUE hides the e.g. Macintosh HD on the Desktop.\nI'd probably opt to either restore the file from a known good backup or delete the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist file and then run killall Finder in Terminal, letting it rebuild and should resolve the permissions issue as well.\n", "Q: Safari homepage hijacked and I can't change back imac 2011 10.10.5\nSafari had homepage hijacked and I can't change it back to google.com.

Is it possible that the seller would have experienced the problem and not have declared it, and that the buyer would see no symptom, perhaps until the machine gets really warm? The problem is supposedly a heat dissipation problem. Could it be latent—in the sense that it would appear and disappear—or does it become always visible once it manifests?\nIn particular, it appears that the user can switch from the AMD to the Intel GPU. If that's the case, how can I guard against a seller having activated the Intel GPU to conceal a problem with the AMD GPU?\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's repair program lapsed.\n\n*A.S.E. Q&As on the issue in question: 1, 2\n\nA: The failing GPUs in these units are all subject to failure in a timeframe most would call premature. This is because the the cooling system and the generation of and the vulnerability to heat of the AMD chips are mismatched. All official Apple repairs were nothing more than swapping out the entire logic board and replacing it with the exact same thing, spec wise. Above normal room temperature and really stressing the GPU with 3D rendering while a second monitor is plugged in (getting even more heat from the thunderbolt chips) is a surefire way to further shorten the lifetime of the AMD chips.\nInvesting into a used machine from 2011 with AMD chips inside is a bad idea unless it is really cheap. That is because the issues can be indeed latent in the early stages. The problem starts with different symptoms and in different stages, some of them might be gone for a while, especially if everything else is unplugged, the fan speed upped to ~2500–3000 (almost inaudible for most people over 19 or so), air conditioned room, etc. [To use a AMD chip in this generation of MBPs the chip itself has to replaced with a more robust, later, cooler revision and ideally the cooling system improved (better thermal compound better applied and additional holes for the airflow)] For an example of latent issues in the early stages see this post.\nBut most frustrating would be a common practice popularised on youtube and other sides: reflowing/baking the logic board. That is a failed AMD chip is heated to 120–200 degrees Celsius and thereafter shown off as a re-animated corpse. But only for a short time compared to the time it was running before with no apparent problems. This procedure has a kind of half-life until the problems come back, and worse that time, breaking even sooner than before and eventually failing completely with no amount of baking doing any good any more.\nThat means that a self-sourced OS is of only limited value to protect against a rogue seller. A GPU treated in this way is dying soon but likely not in the time it usually takes to make a quick test of basic function in a typical sales situation. This is a latent problem in my definition.\nNevertheless it is not really possible to protect yourself from a rebaked chip. But it is possible – in a limited way – to guard against someone showing off a GPU-switching Mac with only intel GPU active (like certain hacks): \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your own OS. That is: macOS from an external drive. Then go into Apple Menu>About This Mac>System Report and check what is listed there. Since your own OS will contain the drivers but not the hacks: Manipulated to iGPU-only Macs will only list the IntelHD3000 chip there. (But also very likely hang on boot with your stick/drive) If you see trouble on boot in this configuration: reset the SMC/PRAM/NVRAM, reboot again and if there are immediately visible artefacts: then confront the seller! \n\n*Boot your own OS. That is: try a LiveLinux like Ubuntu. Problems already manifest show up quicker there since even the basic acceleration there (without the proprietary drvers) stress the chip too much. Also check the hardware from your chosen Linux distribution.\n", "Q: What privacy setting must be enabled to use Night Shift's Sunset to Sunrise option? I'm trying to enable the Sunset to Sunrise option for Nightshift. When I do so, a pop-up informs me that it \"requires location for time zone to be enabled,\" and offers a button to send me to the appropriate privacy settings page. Here's a screenshot of the pop-up.\n\nBut the privacy settings appears to have no option corresponding to what's referenced in the pop-up. Here's two screenshots showing my privacy settings:\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, all privacy settings are enabled, but Night Shift still refuses to enable sunset to sunrise. Does anyone know how I can enable it?\n\nA: Final answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck \"Setting Time Zone\"\n\n*Recheck \"Setting Time Zone\"\n\n\nShame on Apple to have us do that..\n\nA: You need to have your Wi-Fi connection on, so the system can find your location. I was just using Ethernet and had Wi-Fi turned off so it couldn't properly locate me. You'll probably also need a restart after the location locks down, but I haven't tried that yet.\n\nA: Update: Rebooting isn't required! See response below. The rest of this answer is correct.\nRebooting didn't help and I couldn't get Apple's official instructions (https://support.apple.com/kb/PH26239?locale=en_US) to work, either.\nI ended up unchecking \"Setting Time Zone\", rebooting, and then rechecking \"Setting Time Zone\" after the reboot. Selecting Sunrise to Sunset was then accepted without complaint. \nHere are the complete instructions, using variations on Apple's official instructions:\nUncheck the Setting Time Zone option: Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click Privacy. Select Enable Location Services, scroll down to System Services, click Details, deselect Setting Time Zone, then click Done.\nOptionally, reboot (Although I'm not sure this step is necessary, it's what I did. [Users have reported this is not required])\nCheck the Setting Time Zone option: Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click Privacy. Select Enable Location Services, scroll down to System Services, click Details, select Setting Time Zone, then click Done.\n\nA: Here's another \"privacy setting\" that's relevant:\n\n\nA: Reboot.\nSometimes, settings don't come into effect until you reboot your device, especially if it's a system-wide preference. Rebooting tends to solve most System Preferences-related issues.\nSometimes, System Preferences won't tell you to reboot your device, but if something isn't working, rebooting should solve your issue.\nNight Shift location services do not take effect until your computer is rebooted.\n\nA: Unchecking the Setting Time Zone then changing Night Shift option to location works without rebooting on Mojave.\n\nA: in time zone setting untick set automatically time zone base on current location \nand set manual time zone base on your location.\nand then set sunrise to sunset. it's work\n", "Q: Changed User ID Whilst Logged In (Still Logged in Now) I was changing some settings when I came across the user id in the accounts section.

I roll around on the floor on top of a tennis ball for a half hour.  During this time I watch stuff on my MacBook Pro, which is running El Capitan.  I control it with my Magic Trackpad.\nI'm sufficiently far away that reading Finder items is a little difficult, so I'd love to be able to zoom the screen with the trackpad.  But the Trackpad System Preference is useless for this; it seems it only works with e.g. iPhotos.  Accessibility System Preference insists that a key be held down while doing the zoom gesture in order to zoom the screen, so it's useless too.\nSo, does anyone know of an application or extension for El Capitan which will do whole-screen zooms from JUST a trackpad gesture?  Googling turns up nothing useful :(\n\nA: I use BetterTouchTool (BTT) for customizing a trackpad (or I did before my trackpad fell apart has yet to be replaced). I know that BTT can do what you are asking. Since it can also be used to customize most other input devices (keyboard, mouse, remote, etc.) and not just a trackpad I still make use of it without a trackpad and with or without I consider it one of my essential pieces of software. I've moved most of the my shortcuts to BTT so that all my alterations are in one place.\nBTT allows you to set up most any gesture you'd like, not just the standard Apple gestures. The downside is that the documentation is somewhat sparse and it can help to have a certain amount of technical experience to figure out how to set up certain functions but your desired need shouldn't be too difficult to configure. \nI believe that you can download a trial version before deciding to pay for the app and the license cost is very reasonable and done as  a \"pay what you can\" sale (with a low minimum cost).

Is there any chance, seeing as in practise the Fusion Drive only consist of one drive, I will be able to retrieve information from that disk? Either that it will mount normally or I will be able to extract files from it with for instance Data Rescue?\nAnd secondly, is there a chance Disk Utility will be able to actually fix this, if I click the 'Fix' button, and restore the disk with all its contents?\n\nA: Ok so I did a test before I tried it with the actual affected drive. I had an old 60 GB laptop spinning hard drive, and a 32 GB laptop-form-factor Corsair SSD, which I made into a Fusion Drive.\nI first formatted each drive and did a secure erase in the process to make sure there were no retrievable files left on the drives. Then used the appropriate diskutil command to make the two into a 92 GB Fusion drive.\n\nThen I copied my 76 GB Photos Library over to this drive, which will make sure there have to be files on both drives. Then left it to \"simmer\" for a while (i.e. left some time for Core Storage to move files and file blocks around), maybe 1 hour. Then I opened Photos with that library, deleted, duplicated and modified a few photos, maybe 10 or so, over about 15 minutes.\nI know this is not a perfect representation of real world usage of a Fusion Drive over a long time, but I feel it would give me a reasonable true idea of the rescue potential of the files in a similar Fusion Drive setup.\nThen the test: I properly unmount the Fusion Drive, then plug only the spinning hard drive back in. This replicates the problem with the iMac am I having, where the internal SSD went offline.\nNow running the diskutil corestorage list command I see the exact same as I did with the iMac: the logical volume is there, but one of the physical disk is listed with no properties to show for it.\nI then issue the diskutil cs delete command with the UUID of the logical volume (i.e.the Fusion Drive). It looks like diskutil is formatting the spinning hard drive as a normal HFS+ GUID partition disk, and after it's done the spinning hard drive appears on the desktop, seemingly empty, as you would expect.\nRunning Disk Rescue 4 on this disk with a Deep Scan shows me the the file rescue potential of this scenario is actually very good. DR4 is able to restore file names and folder structure of approximately 80% of the files and I end of with about 56 GB worth of images.\nAfter this test I basically do the same with the actual iMac that I was tasked with, and I had pretty similar file rescue results with that internal 1 TB spinning hard drive.\n", "Q: Edit from-address in Mail.app? I use subaddressing a lot when I send e-mails. Currently I use Thunderbird with some plugins for this purpose but it is slow and I would prefer to use Mail.app.\nIs there a way in Mail.app to edit the from address when composing a new mail?\n\nA: Not the answer you're looking for, but there's no way to use subaddressing from Apple Mail in the way you're after. \niCloud itself does support the overall functionality via email aliases, but this is limited to three email aliases per account (unless you previously moved across from MobileMe with five email aliases). More information about this is available at Create an email alias in iCloud Mail, although this is rather limited compared to what you're really after and only relates to iCloud mail.\nUnfortunately, I'm also not aware of any plugin that add this functionality, but hopefully someone will develop one in future as the demand for this seems to be increasing, especially as a way to help users tag email addresses based on the services they're subscribing/signing up to.\nYou also won't get any joy from MS Outlook as it still doesn't support this (although, similar to Apple, Microsoft does support it via its Outlook.com service).\nThere may be other solutions, but I'm not personally aware of any (except for gmail which does support this).\nIn the meantime you could provide feedback to Apple about Mail.\n\nA: Since there is no native native mechanism to edit the email address in From: field in Mail.app in macOS (you can select from one of the available addresses by clicking on the email address in From: field and selecting from the dropdown), you can make use of email aliases in Mail on Mac.\n\nCreate or change an alias\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Choose Mail → Preferences, then click Accounts.\n  \n*Select an account, then click Account Information.\n  \n*Click the Email Address pop-up menu, choose Edit Email Addresses, then do one of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Add an alias: Click the Add button (+), then enter a name and email address.\n  \n*Edit an alias: Click the Full Name or Email Address field, then change the name or email address.\n  \n*Remove an alias: Select an alias, then click the Remove button (-).\n  \n  \n\nPre-add all the desired aliases in the Mail.app preferences and select the desired one as needed.\n", "Q: Can a low-wattage adapter fully recharge the battery of a turned off MacBook? MacBooks come with power adapters that provide a certain wattage (for example 87 W) required to keep the computer running and charge the battery. If used with a lower-wattage power adapter (for example 61 W), there might not be enough power to keep the computer running. However, could such a lower-wattage power adapter be used to fully recharge the battery if the computer is kept turned off?\nCould even a low-wattage iPhone charger be used for this, although it would probably take a long time?\nUpdate: The question concerns newer MacBooks with USB-C chargers.\n\nA: Yes, it will charge from a lower-wattage adapter so long as the computer is not burning the energy faster than the charger is providing it.\nI personally have a 15\" 2016 MBP. It came with an 87W adapter, which I usually leave at work. At home, I have an Anker USB-PD 60W adapter. Typically lack of wattage isn't noticeable, but on a few occasions, while running the MacBook Pro hard, I have noticed the battery is not charging, or even draining. In that case I need to calm things down or plug in the 87W adapter.*\nAnything with a USB-PD charger should be able to charge the battery, even the 30W model, though in that case your MacBook Pro may need to be asleep to charge.\n*Fun fact, you don't actually need to unplug the 60W adapter in this case, the computer will draw from the higher wattage adapter, and stop drawing from the lower. See this question.\nUpdate in 2020\nI've now charged on low-power chargers countless times. I've even recharged overnight with a 3A phone charger when I didn't have anything better. It takes hours but you'll have a full charge in the morning.\nTheoretically, the 15\" Macbook's 7.2Ah battery would charge in 4 hours assuming 60% efficiency, that the charger actually puts out a full 3 amps, and there is no usage during that time. At 2.4A, you'd be around 5 hours and so forth.\n\nA: Assuming you are referencing the MacBooks and MacBook Pros with USB-C ports (2016 and up), the short answer is yes, a low power adapter could charge the MacBook which requires a higher power adapter to function.\n(and yes, it will take a very, very long time)\nAs for Macs with the MagSafe adapter, since the DC-In board (or MagSafe power board) \"checks\" the power coming it, if it's not of the right voltage/wattage, it won't charge.\n\nA: Some devices like Thinkpad X1 Tablet and XPS 15 require at least 45W charger when turned on. Error message claims such charger may work during sleep or turned off states.\n", "Q: Invoke AppleScript from Outlook With the loss of the AppleScript menu in Outlook 15, what is the easiest way to launch AppleScripts from within Outlook?  \nIn earlier versions, these scripts were located in /Users/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Outlook Script Menu Items/.  Is this folder still relevant?\n\nA: You can use the AppleScript menu on the Menu bar. Script Editor > Preferences... > General\n\n\n*\n\n*Script Menu: [√] Show Script menu in menu bar\n\n\nPlace your scripts in: ~/Library/Scripts\n\nOr create Automator Service workflows using a Run AppleScript action.\n\n\n*\n\n*Automator > New > Service\n\n*Service receives selected no input in any application\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action\n\n*Replace the default AppleScript code with you code.\n\n*Save the Service workflow.

I’m trying to install macOS Sierra on VirtualBox, but can’t seem to make it work. For reference, here are the steps I took.\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded the Install macOS Sierra app from the App Store.\n\n*Used the inbuilt media creation executable, CreateInstallMedia on a disk image.\n\n*Created a new VM with the default settings for an OS X El Capitan, plus 128 VRAM.\n\n*Since VirtualBox refused to accept the DMG, I tried splicing out the InstallESD.\n\n*VirtualBox now accepted it, but wouldn’t boot. I tried to boot through rEFInd, but still no luck.\n\n*I tried to patch it both ways (base system and ESD) with iesd. No luck.\n\n*When booting to GParted LiveCD, it flat-out refused to discover any of the installer CDs.\n\n\nHow can I patch the installer to work with VirtualBox? I don’t want to use pre-patched versions of either the installer or an existing installation, as though to avoid piracy.\n\nA: Installing macOS as a VM in VirtualBox\nThese instructions will guide you through the process of creating and using bootable media to install macOS in a VirtualBox VM.\nPre-Requisites\n\n*\n\n*Installer for for macOS (El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra, etc.)\n\n*VirtualBox 5.0+ (may work with older versions, but not tested)\n\n*Newly created macOS VM created with standard settings (EFI, blank 60GB SSD, 128M video memory, 3D acceleration, 4GB RAM)\n\nWe are going to use the createinstallmedia utility included with the macOS Install App to create a USB image.  However, there's nothing that says it must be a physical USB device and not a disk image instead.  For this we are going to use VB's ability to access a \"raw\" drive through a VMDK which will act as a pass-through device that VB can recognize and mount.\nIn the steps below, assume the working directory is the user's home (~/).\n\nStep 1:  Create the Installation Media\nUsing hdiutil create a sparse (expanding) disk image with a size of 6GB\nhdiutil create -size 6GB -fs HFS+ -volname \"macos-installation-media\" -type SPARSE ~/macos-installation-media\n\nNext, mount the image\nhdiutil mount ~/macos-installation-media.sparseimage\n\nYou will get a message that looks similar to the one below.  Pay attention to the disk identifier as you will need it in Step 2.  In my environment, mine was disk7 your's will likely be different.\n\n/dev/disk7            GUID_partition_scheme\n/dev/disk7s1          EFI\n/dev/disk7s2          Apple_HFS                       /Volumes/macos-installation-media\n\n\nFinally, use createinstallmedia from the macOS Installer to create the installation image:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/macos-installation-media --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/\n\nAllow it to finish.  When it's done it will automount the new Volume and you should see it on your Desktop.\nThe newly created image will need to be unmounted for the next step, so go ahead an unmount the disk.\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk7\n\n\nStep 2:  Create the VMDK\nTo do this, we are going to use VirtualBox's \"raw hard disk access\" to create a pass through to the newly created drive image.\nThe syntax of the command is as follows:\nVBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename </path/to/file>.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk#\n\nSo, for our purposes, the command would be (note the escaped spaces)\nVBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename ~/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk7\n\nThe VMDK will be a very small file that simply points to disk you created in Step 1. Now you can attach the VMDK to your VM and boot from it.\nAdd the VMDK to your VM and Boot\nBefore you can add the newly created VMDK to your VM, you need to take ownership of it.  Since it was created using sudo, root has ownership and rights.  Be sure to replace \"joeuser\" with your username in the command example below:\nsudo chown joeuser:staff Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.vmdk\n\nUsing the VirtualBox GUI, select the desired VM, click Settings, click Storage, click Add Hard Disk button, select Choose existing drive, and then select the VMDK file you just created.\n\nBoot your VM.  VirtualBox will automatically find the bootable volume and begin the installation process.\n\nA: \nI realize the OP was asking about Sierra.

Not extremely slow but the switch is not immediate and I have to wait about 0.3 seconds. Conversely if I have an emacs window opened and type \"emacs\" in the spotlight, then the transition is immediate, so I would like to remove that unnecessary waiting.\nSince I hate that waiting time (it seems very short but when you need to navigate a lot trough applications it becomes awkward) for now I am doing the following:\nI have removed the emacs deamon, every time I log in I start emacs.app, when I need to close the emacs app I don't use CMD+Q but CMD+H, when I need to recall emacs I simply launch emacs.app (trough an Alfred 3 shortcut) so I get emacs focus.\nWith this workaround the transition to emacs is immediate, but I would prefer my script for two reasons: first, with the script so I can use emacs from terminal before having launched an emacs instance opening emacs.app, but the real reason is that using this method if I type \"emacsclient -t myFile\" in terminal and then I close the buffer returning to the terminal, then the emacs windows (the emacs.app) will get the focus, even if I have not given it to it. This is really awkward.\nIMPORTANT EDIT:\nI noticed that opening a new instance is immediate, what takes time is open -a Emacs.

I want to connect my 2010 LED Cinema Display 27\" which uses a Mini DisplayPort connection. The clerk at the Apple Store wrongfully sold me the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter, which did not work. I later confirmed on Apple's support site that it does not work for this use.\nI then purchased an AllSmartLife \"USB C Type to Mini DisplayPort Adapter\" from Amazon, which had many reviews from people having successfully made the connection I am trying to make.

If so, which adapters did you use?\n\nA: I have the exact same problem and after much search, came to this solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual-Link DIV to DisplayPort using Apple's connector\n\n*DisplayPort to USB-C using this connector Which is a  USB-C to Mini-DisplayPort and Charging Port Adapter {Amazon.com}\n\n\nKeep in mind that the Cinema display also needs a USB-A connection (I'm guessing to provide power to some internal circuit for link negotiation?), so you'll need a separate adapter from USB-C to USB-A.\nI'm also an amateur photographer and shoots with a Canon 5DsR, editing my photos using an AdobeRGB LG 4K display (10-bit color to support AdobeRGB). I've also tested the DisplayPort adapter on this display and it works flawlessly.\nOn a side note - reason why you'll need a separate adapter for USB-A instead of having the USB-A built-in to the DisplayPort adapter is that only way for USB-C to support DisplayPort data-rate is using Display Protocol, which turns a bi-directional USB connection (10Gbit/direction) to a uni-directional output port (20Gbit total). If you work out the math: 3840 * 2160 * 10-bit color per channel * 3 color channels (RGB) * 60 Hz = 15Gbit/s.\n", "Q: Can I use Bluetooth and headphone jack simultaneously I have an iPhone 7plus.

Like any test, AHT isn't immune to false positives/negatives.  \nTo truly verify if it's your hardware or software, install a generic USB camera (FaceTime camera is technically a USB camera) which uses the same underlying software as the FaceTime cam.  If it works, it's a hardware issue.\nRegarding your AHT error code indicating a bad drive; just because it uses the code \"HDD\" doesn't mean it's not applicable to SSDs.  An SSD or HDD uses the exact same ATA command set to interface with so if you are getting an error code it is valid and applicable.\nAgain, AHT is not the definitive answer, but a tool to help you diagnose problems.  If it's giving you an error code, it's something you should start looking into.\n\nA: Just wanted to chime in and say that this also just started happening to me.

(In my case, I modified the $PS1 variable in /etc/bashrc.) However, that change does not modify the command prompt when one elevates privileges to root using sudo -s.  \nDoes anyone know where the command prompt preference is stored on a macOS Sierra (10.12.5) machine for an admin user who has elevated his privileges to root using sudo -s?\nI have tried modifying the following files...\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/root/.bash_profile\n\n*/var/root/.bash_rc\n\n*/var/root/bash_rc\n\n*/var/root/.profile\n\n*~/.profile\n\n\nI have also tried using the command export PS1=\"Some prompt here# \", which changes the root prompt temporarily, but it does not stick when the session is ended and a new one is started.\n\nA: Add the SUDO_PS1 environment variable to your ~/.bash_profile and then export the variable, such as:\nexport SUDO_PS1=\"\\[\\h:\\w\\] \\u\\\\$ \"\nNote however this will only change the root prompt as it appears after you have elevated your rights via sudo.\nA good list of prompt variables can be found here.\n\nA: I am assuming that you are not actually logging in to your Mac as root since enabling root login is a really bad thing.\nSo you are using the command sudo -s to open a root shell from your own login. Under those circumstances the profile being run is your own. The best way to make any changes, such as to the prompt is to use an if in your profile, for example \n# color prompt and make root red\nif [ `id -u` = 0 ]\nthen\n    PS1=\"\\[\\033[31m\\]\\h:\\W \\u\\$\\[\\033[0m\\] \"\nelse\n    PS1=\"\\[\\033[34m\\]\\h:\\w \\u\\$\\[\\033[0m\\] \"\nfi\n\nIn this example the top PS1 is for root and sets the prompt to red and the second PS1 is for any other user, e.g. you. You can make any other environment changes you want in the if as well.\n\nA: From the sudo manual:\n-s, --shell    Run the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is set or the shell\n               specified by the invoking user's password database entry.  If a command is specified, it\n               is passed to the shell for execution via the shell's -c option.  If no command is\n               specified, an interactive shell is executed.\n\nAn interactive shell would read the invoking user's .bashrc. So, Tony Williams' solution would work if it is in your .bashrc. But da4's solution should also work if it is placed in your .bash_profile. \n", "Q: Virtual and native OS systems - Sierra, Mavericks and Windows/Bootcamp? I have a late 2011 MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM (system max) and a 1TB SSD.  The drive has two partitions – one running MacOS Sierra 10.12.5 and the second running Mavericks 10.9.5 (for purposes of keeping commercially licensed software that is now only available as monthly/annually-paid subscriptions). This is the most complex setup I've ever attained, just to give you an idea of my technical expertise.\nI would like to install Parallels/Fusion/other so that I can access my legacy apps without a restart, and Windows (via Bootcamp or other option?), and achieve a setup in which ALL THREE of these scenarios are possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can startup in Sierra and run Mavericks and/or Windows virtually as needed\n\n*I can startup in Mavericks and run my legacy apps natively\n\n*I can startup in a Bootcamp-based Windows mode (or other non-virtual method)\n\n\nBefore making any build changes that potentially “break” my current setup, I wanted to reach out for advice as to what is/isn't possible and the best method to achieve a system capable of accessing the three OS's.  As I've researched, part of what I'm struggling with is perhaps not fully understanding how virtualization works.  I'm not sure how much I can rely on it, hence keeping native bootable drives for each in my setup.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use Parallels/Fusion/other to run my EXISTING Mavericks drive within Sierra or will I have to reinstall the OS and legacy applications through virtualization software?\n\n*Assuming a setup in which Mavericks can be run virtually in Sierra, will I be able to run Mavericks natively by rebooting to it as my Startup Disk if/when needed?\n\n*If I add a Bootcamp-built Windows partition, can it also be run virtually in Sierra (or do I have to choose one or the other)?\n\nA: In my opinion a set-up covering all three scenarios is possible but it requires a lot of work and the whole thing is probably fragile and won't survive upgrades or special updates of either of the partitions.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Parallels Desktop as well as VMware Fusion allow to use the Boot Camp partition as virtual machine without losing the ability to boot to the physical volume. In the past this feature had some hick-ups though (e.g. loosing Windows activation).\n\n*Triple boot macOS 10.12/OS X 10.9/Windows should be covered by one of David Anderson's answers. One answer showing the basic approach can be found here: Installing Ubuntu on Mac with macOS and Windows already installed. Install a basic OS X system (Sierra), install Windows with the Boot Camp Assistant. Resize the Sierra partition without touching the Windows partitions, add a partition for Mavericks and install Mavericks (or backup & resize-clone your current Mavericks partition).\n\n*At least in VMware Fusion it's possible to boot another OS X partition as VM with a raw disk device - this is the method also used with the virtualized Boot Camp partition but not documented to work with OS X partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a basic OS X 10.9 virtual machine without installing anything. Shutdown the VM and quit VMware Fusion. This will create a vmwarevm bundle. Open the package (right click > Show package bundle).\n\n\n\n\n\n*Open Terminal and enter diskutil list. Determine the partition numbers of the EFI, the Mavericks partition and the Mavericks recovery partition (probably disk0s1, disk0s4 and disk0s5). Unmount the Mavericks volume.\n\n*Change directory: cd \"/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library/\"\n\n*Create a raw disk with the disk number and the partition numbers found in the previous step (the EFI partition is required, the recovery partition probably not):\n./vmware-rawdiskCreator create /dev/disk0 1,4,5 ~/Desktop/Virtual\\ Disk sata\n\nor without recovery partition\n./vmware-rawdiskCreator create /dev/disk0 1,4 ~/Desktop/Virtual\\ Disk sata\n\nThe command will create two files on your desktop: Virtual Disk-pt.vmdk and Virtual Disk.vmdk\n\n*Move the files into the 10.9 vmwarevm bundle (and replace the existing Virtual Disk.vmdk file):\n\n\n\n\n\n*Launch VMware Fusion and configure the OS X 10.9 VM (processors/RAM/network - bridged devices). Launch the VM.\n\n\nThis is tested with a full Mavericks system on an external thumb drive using an El Capitan host and it works. Mavericks and El Capitan both were and still are bootable as real systems.\nIf your SSD contains one or more CoreStorage Volume Groups it's more complicated. I would revert to the standard OS X partition scheme first.\n\nRecommendation:\nVirtualize everything except Sierra because a simple error/user mistake in the set-up outlined above may render all systems unbootable.\n", "Q: Facing Pages in Pages 6.x I think this question is fairly straight-forward: is there any way to get Pages 6.x (I have 6.2) to have facing pages?

This does not appear for new text files.\nHow can I save a new text file to the same folder as the selected files?\n\nA: Since you did not include your workflow, what type of workflow it is, or which version of OS X/macOS you're using, I can only offer an example of how you can set a variable to use for the Where: in a New Text File action in an Automator workflow. \nI have a Temp folder, which I created, in the root the Macintosh HD, and in this folder I created two plain text files, named Filename1.txt and Filename2.txt, each of which contain a single line of text, \"The name of this file is Filename1.txt\" and \"The name of this file is Filename2.txt\", respectively.\nThe following Automator workflow works with selected Finder items in Finder's frontmost window, or the Desktop as appropriate if no other individual Finder windows are frontmost with a selection, and using a Run AppleScript action sets a variable to the parent folder of the first item selected to be used as the Where: in a New Text File action. and creates a file named Combined.txt.\nNote in the image below, there is a break in the link between the Set Value of Variable action and what is the second Get Selected Finders Item action.  This disconnect is created by selecting Ignore this action's input under Options in the second Get Selected Finders Item action.\nThe variable inputParentFolder was dragged and dropped from the Variable section at the bottom of the workflow pane into the Where: in the New Text File action.\nAs you can see in the image below, the workflow completed successfully combining the content of the two selected files in Finder into a new file named Combined.txt in the same folder as the selected files.\n\n", "Q: Do iPhones have a built-in mouse or trackpad and how do I use it? Quite some time ago someone told me (or maybe I read it) that iPhones have a built-in trackpad or mouse pointer that makes it easy for you to move the cursor around for editing text. I want to know if this is actually possible? \nRight now my computer is in for repairs and I’m stuck using an iPhone to edit a Word document and being able to do this would be great if its possible, but I can’t see any options anywhere in the settings.\nSo is it true that iPhones have a built-in trackpad or mouse pointer function? And how do I get to use it?\n\nA: iOS 13 and later\nAs of iOS 13 and above the process for using this feature has changed.\nThe steps are largely the same as for iOS 12 and earlier (see below), but instead of pressing hard on any of the keys on your keyboard, you need to press on the space bar and not let go to see and use the trackpad.\nThe other change is that this feature is now available to any iPhone compatible with iOS 13 or later, not just iPhones with 3D Touch. So, models like the iPhone SE are now covered!\niOS 12 and earlier\nYes, this is true but not for all iPhones. It has to be an iPhone 6S or above (basically any iPhone with 3D Touch, which unfortunately means the current iPhone SE is not included).\nThe way to access it is via the keyboard, so you need to already have the keyboard visible on the screen.\nMore specifically, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Press hard on any of the keys on your keyboard (but don’t let go)\n\n*After a moment your keyboard will turn into a grey “trackpad”, so to speak (remember, don’t let go)\n\n*Now move your finger around the grey trackpad area (where your keyboard was) and this moves your cursor around the editing area (so if it’s only a small field, you can only move the cursor around that, if it’s your Word document, you should be able to move around the page).\n\n*As soon as you let go, the trackpad disappears and your keyboard returns, and you can start typing from where you left the cursor.\n\nHighlighting text\nSince you’re stuck having to edit a Word doc on your iPhone, you’ll probably need to know how to highlight text while using the above feature. This is a little tricky, but you just move the cursor to a word you want to highlight and then reduce the pressure on your finger ever so slightly for a moment and then press hard again. This should highlight the word for you.\nNote:- This may take a little while to get used to and, while handy, certainly doesn’t make the job of editing a Word document on your iPhone easy! But it is handy for small notes or adding comments to news stories, etc.\n[EDIT]\nBelow are two screenshots showing a before and after shot of how this works when using this mode to edit this very answer!\n\n\nA: This is also possible on an iPad, even one without force touch. When the keyboard is up, simply do the following on the keyboard (all of these require two fingers): \n\n\n*\n\n*Drag to move cursor like a trackpad. \n\n*Single tap to highlight the current word. \n\n*Double tap to highlight the sentence.\n\n*Triple tap to highlight everything.\nWhen something is highlighted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag left to move the left highlight bound.\n\n*Drag right to move the right highlight bound.\n", "Q: Video not playing in Firefox on Mac When I open this link Erlang which has a video, the video won't play.

Are playgrounds created in Xcode compatible with the iPad Playgrounds app? That is, can I drop it into the iPad app's Documents folder (or otherwise use iCloud Drive, etc) to load a playground created in Xcode?\nGoogling neither confirms nor deny this.\n\nA: I just tried running one on my iPad Air downloaded from this Swift Blog post as well as the ones found on the Resources Page and most of them just returned errors. You may see the attached image. Tests were run on iPad Air running iOS 11 Dev Beta & XCode playground Beta a well as further testing on an older iPad Air running iOS 10.3.3 and Xcode Playgrounds (older version)\nThe following error message is displayed:\nError Compiling Source\n\nError: Sources/CoreGraphicsDiagramView.swift:2: no such module 'XCPlayground'\n\nProof available at link posted below. \nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/t6qZY.png\n\nA: Xcode Playgrounds and Swift Playgrounds are indeed compatible. In fact, they both use the same .playground files and a Playground created with one may be opened with the other.\nThe errors experienced by bret7600 are coincidental to different versions of Swift being used and the code not being updated to reflect the changes. For example, in the posted screenshot, this error occurs simply because XCPlayground was renamed to PlaygroundSupport and the import statements in the code need to be updated to reflect that.\nIn general, the most recent release versions of Xcode and Swift Playgrounds (the iOS app) should be using the same version of the Swift toolchain and therefore will be compatible.\nWarning: Although Xcode is perfectly capable of opening and running playgrounds created on iPad and vice versa, there is an important difference. While the iPad app fully supports iCloud, Xcode does not. As a result, you should not try editing the same file on iPad and Mac at the same time, and you'll need to re-open the file in Xcode to see any changes you made on iPad. This is perhaps why the \"Playgrounds\" iCloud Drive folder is hidden on macOS in Finder.\n", "Q: Why does iOS 9 get bricked when reset to 1970? iOS 8/9 will get bricked if you set your date back too far. If someone could explain how exactly this happens, I would love to know.\n\nA: In some time zones, setting the date to 1 Jan 1970 will set the internal clock to a number less than zero, as the time is stored in GMT (as the number of seconds since midnight on that date) and then the offset is applied before display. In other time zones, setting the clock will result in a positive time value. Best guess is that this is triggered by having the time value less than zero.\nThis behaviour can be replicated by creating an NPT server on a network and injecting it to multiples devices. If the time returned to the device is negative, the device will crash.\n", "Q: Simplest way to get a public URL for a photo from Photos App?

Fearing the worst, I did everything I felt I could, dried it out with the \"fan trick\", opened it up, etc. It eventually powered back up with the battery inside but attaching the MagSafe adapter did not change the status of the battery and indeed the LED indicator light did not turn on. I was initially scared that it would not draw power from the adapter at all, but upon disconnecting the battery the MacBook boots up when the MagSafe is plugged in.\nSo I do not know where to go from here. I tried some easy things, like resetting the SMC, I tried every possible direction I could find for that (they seem to vary slightly based on who you ask, I definitely tried Apple's official directions). The orange LED light came on the adapter for a few minutes after one such attempt, but as soon as I restarted the computer it returned to not charging. I can confirm that when the battery is plugged in and the MagSafe is plugged in, the MagSafe draws no power (confirmed with a power meter). I think the only confirmed cases I've seen like this on support forums that were solved involved having Apple replace the logic board, which is not really logical from a cost perspective at this point.\nI'm wondering exactly which part is messed up. My fear is that it's the logic board, and I just don't really know how to confirm it, but I'd hate to give up just because I don't know a lot about how the circuitry works. My bottom line question is: which piece of hardware would cause this problem to occur (if any)? I've noticed there's a DC-in board separate from the logic board in my disassembly (and looking at the pictures from ifixit) and potentially the cable itself could be problematic somehow, but I'm not sure how to confirm what's wrong or how to test it. Any help is appreciated!\nAs a note, I'm not going to bother with having Apple fix this, because they will know it's water-damaged and will want to replace the whole logic board. Admittedly that may be the problem, but I'd rather just bite the bullet and get a brand new computer at that point. I'm looking for a smaller fix, if such a fix exists.\n\nA: After borrowing several different power adapters, I determined there was something inconsistent. The mid-2012 MBPs come with the MagSafe 1 \"L\" connector power adapter, but the pin layout is the same as the \"T\" connector models. I tried two of each and the L hasn't been able to charge my battery and the T charges consistently. Each time I made sure to use the right wattage adapter, which is 60W for this model.\nI can't explain this, but it's charging now. Leaving this in case anyone else manages to dump water on their Macbook or have it fail in a similar fashion. I'd love to know why it works with only T connector adapters, but I'm guessing this is such a niche question it has not been looked into. I have also determined that in the \"Power\" section of System Report, it gives full power adapter info (serial number, model, etc.) for the T connector adapters I have used but not for the L connector adapters, so it seems to be an issue with the charge control (middle) pin on the MagSafe.\nLong story short, always try another adapter if you have any others available. Switching to a different connector type fixed my issue.\n", "Q: Can an AppleScript create new variables on its own? I have an AppleScript .app file that creates a list variable based on a website's HTML data. The number of items in this list varies based on the unique HTML data that is downloaded on every iteration, and can range from 1 to 50.\nI ultimately want to display the contents of each line as its own drop-down menu in one dialog. I am using the external script library, Dialog Toolkit, to accomplish this, which requires the declaration of many additional variables.\nDialog Toolkit works differently than choose from list, for example. The choose from list dialog will automatically adjust its size to add a new line for each list item. But, for a Dialog Toolkit dialog, you instead must separately define (i.e., as its own unique variable) every drop-down menu that is needed. If you don't, zero drop-down menus will exist in the dialog.\nHence, 50 if statements are needed to ensure that the dialog contains all drop-down menus, like so:\nrepeat with i from 1 to (count of theList)\n        if (i is 1) then\n            set {dropdown1} to create labeled dropdown (item i of theList)\n        else if (i is 2) then\n            set {dropdown2} to create labeled dropdown (item i of theList)\n        i if (i is 3) then\n            set {dropdown3} to create labeled dropdown (item i of theList)\n        else if (i is 4) then\n\n        ...\n\n        else if (i is 50) then\n            set {dropdown50} to create labeled dropdown (item i of theList)\n        end if\nend repeat\n\n-- Note: The above code snippet is a very stripped down version of my code.\n\nIs it possible for an AppleScript to create, on its own, new variables that have formulaic titles?\nHere is the type of thing that I desire:\nrepeat with i from 1 to (count of theList)\n    set {((\"dropdown\" & i) as variable)} to create labeled dropdown (item i of theList)\nend repeat\n\n\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \n\n\nA: This is an example of using a list to achieve something similar to what you are trying to do, I think:\n    set varList to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}\n\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        count every tab of window 1\n        set tabCount to result\n        set counterOne to 1\n        repeat tabCount times\n            get URL of tab counterOne of window 1\n            set item counterOne of varList to result\n            set counterOne to counterOne + 1\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        make new window\n        set counterOne to 1\n        repeat tabCount times\n            set tabVari to item counterOne of varList\n            open location tabVari\n            set counterOne to counterOne + 1\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n\n\nA: This is only an answer because I need to include a Script.\nIt might be useful to you to know that you can still write self modifying code in AppleScript.\nHere's an example that adds a \"beep 2\" as its first line every time it is run.\nYou're using a toolkit I'm unfamiliar with, and it might not appreciate having its code changed out from under it, then again, you might get away with it.\n    -- Self Modifying code\n-- BP 2006\n-- Still works in 2019\n\n-- Just a Demo\n-- Run this code twice and look at the first line It will change\n\nset mystring to \"beep 2\"\n\n--display dialog mystring\n\ntell application \"Script Editor\"\n    activate\n    set text of front document to mystring & \"\\r\" & text of front document -- prepend the line as a new line\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Script Editor\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\nLanguage writers worked hard to get rid of self modifying code back on the 80's, but it's still there in AppleScript, and sometimes you can do useful tricks with that fact.\n", "Q: Installing Xcode 7.x on El Capitan 10.11 I am on an old MacBook (mid-2009) that is not supporting Sierra. When I go to the App store to install Xcode 8 (only option available) it says that it is for 10.12 (Sierra) only. That means that if someone has El Capitan only and didn't install Xcode 7 before, cannot start developing apps for macOS / iOS? That seems absurd to me, El Capitan is still a modern OS... I might understand if you are on Leopard, but El Capitan is from 2015!\nIs there any way to (legally) bypass this problem? \n\nA: The last Xcode version compatible with El Capitan is Xcode 8.2.1. If you can't install it from within Apple App Store, visit Apple Developer and download the app there. An Apple ID is required.\nXcode is provided as xip file (signed zip).

Is there a way, when doing screen recording (for online gameplay, for example), to disable all notifications in one step, so that it won't interfere with the screen recording?\nDetails: It can be done by turning off all notifications for 35 apps one by one, and when done with screen recording, turn them on one by one again -- but it will be 70 steps total this way.\nI want to disable any notification at all, including the one that slide down showing \"no preview\" content -- I want to disable those as well -- everything.\n\nA: Do Not Disturb does also hide notifications and you can customize it like allow incoming calls from favorites or everyone. \nWhen the device is locked, it won't light up the screen when receiving a message. But by enabling 'Always' on the bottom of the Do Not Disturb setting page, it will also block the notifications when your device is unlocked. \nSo they won't pop up on your screen, you can only see them by opening the notification center.\n\nA: *\n\n*Set notification preview to never\n\n*Enable DND\n\n*Remove apps and disable notifications that don't respect the above settings.\n\n\nFor some testing you might be able to disable cellular and then block the APNS servers or all internet or just Apple's servers, but local notifications will still trigger since they are designed to do so.\nYour best bet for controlling a demo is to control all the apps and settings closely rather than using a fully loaded device with many sources of distraction or interruption.\nSource.

Out of the blue, the speaker volume became barely audible. By speaker I mean the the loud speaker at the bottom of the phone.\nI've used headphones and bluetooth to see whether those are affected as well - those continue to work fine.\nI've done the following - none fixed the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarted the unit multiple times.\n\n*I've cleaned out the speaker and headphone jack.\n\n*I've blown compressed air at the problem spots.\n\n*I've toggled Settings/General/Accessibility/Phone Noise Cancellation and Hearing Aids options.\n\n*Various miscellaneous things that I've read about here and there.\n\n\nI know that if I take it to Apple store, they will suggest restoring a new phone, which I don't want to do. Other than reinstalling the OS, what else can I do to try and fix this issue?\n\nA: Answering my own question.  \nGot it fixed. In case someone else has this issue, I took it to the Apple store. Turns out the speaker got clogged with microscopic particles (lint, sand, etc...) since I spend a lot of time outdoors. They have a very fine brush that can get those things out. The whole process took like 5 minutes. \n\nA: The solution you mention worked perfectly for me. I have an iPhone 6 and speaker volume was painfully low (I even thought I was getting deaf). Speakerphone calls were simply impossible to handle. \nInstead of taking it to the Mac store, I used one of my camera's lens cleaning brush (NIKKON LENS PEN is $5 dollars at Amazon) and in less than 1 minute, sound was doubled to my estimation. \nThe benefit of having an Apple technician clean your device is if they break it (pushing in the bristles too far), they may have the ability to have the business repair the device at no cost to you. The down side of having an Apple technician is you have to go to them and travel and perhaps wait. If you're comfortable with a gentle toothbrush and won't press the gunk in deeper and make it worse, go ahead and try a DIY cleaning.\nAs long as the substance isn't oily or going to get compacted, you can clean your speaker grills quite effectively with light air or a mechanical duster.\n", "Q: Backup from iPhone on Linux without iTunes Is it possible to back up short messages from an iPhone on Linux, without iTunes?\n\nA: Yes, you can use the libimobiledevice project to backup your iPhone.\nThe project website is: http://www.libimobiledevice.org\nHowever, most Linux distributions have it available in their package managers for easy installation.\nAfter you have libimobiledevice installed, run idevicebackup2 to take a backup of the short message and other data from the phone:\nidevicebackup2 backup myfolder\n\nwhere myfolder is a path to a folder, where you want to store the backup.\nIf you neeed to enter passwords, you'll want to run it as:\nidevicebackup2 -i backup myfolder\n\nwhere -i means to ask for passwords interactively.\nTo then browse the backup in a traditional file tree format run:\nidevicebackup2 unback myfolder\n\nor\nidevicebackup2 -i unback myfolder\n\nA thorough guide can be found at this  link.\n", "Q: How can I view an App's full name? On my iPhone's home screen, I have two versions of Cut The Rope 2 which have identical icons and display names.\nOne version is the full version of Cut The Rope 2, while the other is the F2P Cut The Rope 2: Om Nom's Adventure.\nBecause the display names are identical, I'm not sure which version I should delete.\nIs there a way to view an App's full name?\n\n\nA: No, there's no way you can tell from the Home screen. \nOne way to ensure you delete the correct one is to start the app and look at the title. \nAnother way is to move one of them to a folder and then do a Spotlight search. Spotlight will show you the full name (up to the 30 or 50 character limit, I don't recall the actual number right now) as well as the folder name if it's in a folder. \n", "Q: Is it possible to convert APFS to HFS+ I'm deciding to install MacOS High Sierra on my Mac this autumn.So if I find APFS not useful can I convert it back to HFS+ via terminal or using Disk utility?\n\nA: This autumn of 2017 when High Sierra is released, there will be far more concrete details and evidence for you to make an educated decision. I can’t conceive Apple won’t make clear the risks and benefits on consumer, support, professional and technical levels for APFS. My guess is most people should make one backup and then jump. If you have old software that cannot be updated, you might wait three months for any odd bugs to get documented or worked out if you can’t easily recover from a bootable backup or reinstall your apps at the versions you require. \nAt worst, you can always wipe and reinstall High Sierra on HFS and then copy files from your backup (whether the backup is HFS or APFS or some other file system)\n\nIn July 2017, The migration scripts and functions are still being tested in beta - so today, there are no signs you could revert back from APFS to HFS on the beta macOS. Worse, you shouldn’t even trust the forward conversion yet for non-throwaway system test use. \nMany programs will not work yet on APFS formatted volumes. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://bombich.com/blog/2017/07/07/pondering-conversion-from-hfs-apfs\nI would recommend keeping all your important data and all your system backups clean and untouched by beta versions of APFS scripts. \nWhat seems to work well even now in the beta is copying files back from APFS to HFS if I work on a file or photo in beta and want to keep it on my main system. That’s a very different thing than reverting the entire file system structure, though. \n\nA: I can actually revert to HFS+ (losing my data). I got some help from the following website.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/APFS_Guide/FAQ/FAQ.html\nScreenshot:\n\n", "Q: How do I find my iOS device's RAM? Is there a way to find how much RAM is installed in my iOS device?\n\nA: There are a number of free apps that will provide more information about your device’s internals.

Should I change some of these (back) to root:wheel? \n\nA: Out of the box - root:wheel has ownership of /usr/local and 0755 permissions. It's really up to you what you want. Since you clearly have homebrew or remnants of that, I'd do whatever brew doctor says you need to do for the user account you want to run things. I'd say keeping user:admin permissions is just fine for almost all cases in that part of the directory.\nI have user:admin and 0775 permissions on everything but /usr/local itself and /usr/local/remotedesktop which match and are root:wheel with 0755.\n", "Q: If I encrypt my HD using FireVault, what happens to my (previously unencrypted) TimeMachine backups?

I went ahead and encrypted my disk using FireVault. \nHow does this affect my backups? \nPS: I realize that I can just delete them and have TM start anew. But I am curious.\n\nA: Your backups don't get encrypted unless you explicitly convert or set them up. Time Machine will probably warn you when you have an encrypted source and a non-encrypted destination, but you can choose whether the source or destination or both are encrypted or non-encrypted to suit your needs.\nApple's FileVault and encryption is reversible so you can keep your history and go forward and back (assuming you don't mind the delay to process every block on the storage each time you convert or revert the encryption status)\n", "Q: Exporting SMS messages from iPhone into plain text files Can I get my SMS messages off my iPhone and into a plain text format?

So I turned the \"Back to my Mac\" option on in iCloud and ticked the remote sign in box. But if I issue the command\nssh user_name@computer_name.number.members.btmm.icloud.com\n\nthe terminal just goes into the next line and stays black.\nSorry for not providing more information, but I don't know much about this, so I don't know what else information to provide.\nDoes anybody know what I did wrong?\nEdit: As suggested I used the -vvvv flag and got:\nOpenSSH_7.4p1, LibreSSL 2.5.0\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config\ndebug2: resolving \"computer_name.number.members.btmm.icloud.com\" port 22\ndebug2: ssh_connect_direct: needpriv 0\ndebug1: Connecting to computer_name.number.members.btmm.icloud.com [private_IPv6_address] port 22: Operation timed out\nssh: Connecting to computer_name.number.members.btmm.icloud.com [private_IPv6_address] port 22: Operation timed out\n\nAlso the command \nssh localhost\n\nworks without any troubles.\n\nA: \"Back to my Mac\" uses a special tunnel device configured with two - more or less random and unique - IPv6 addresses from the local address room:\n\n*\n\n*a link local address: fe80...\n\n*a unique local unicast (ULA): fc00… to fdff…\n\nAll IPv6 traffic (computer_name.number.members.btmm.icloud.com is the DNS name of a IPv6 host/device!) is wrapped into IPv4 packets, so that a IPv6 capable router isn't needed. On the Apple side it's unwrapped - probably with some 6in4 relay - and then routed to the remote device.\nApparently this doesn't work if you want to ssh from your own host into your own host (aka ssh -6 %localhost-utun1-ULA%). It works with a second device (also registered with your Apple ID in iCloud) in your own private or a remote network.\nIt's really slow though (tested with two Sierra VMs on one hosting Mac all using the same physical network interface!).\n", "Q: Securing VGA Output Plus Audio From An iPad As part of a retrofitting project for my church, I purchased a variety of equipment.  The minister has a recent model iPad with Lightning port.  I purchased a Lightning to HDMI adapter to get sound and video.  The church's overhead projector, for which there is no budget to replace right now, only handles a VGA input or composite input.  I purchased a Belkin HDMI to VGA adapter that has a 3.5 mm output so I could patch into the audio system's soundboard.\nWhen I hooked this up to my iPad, it initially wanted to work.  It didn't though.  Nothing would play through the lash-up of cables.  I've tested the cables individually for the roles they play and they work.  Together they cannot get me VGA video and sound to run to a mixing board.\nIs there a way to accomplish this through cabling?  Am I missing something or is this a dead end?\n\nA: The Apple Lightning to VGA Adapter works, and when paired with a 3.5mm audio cord plugged directly into the output on the iPad, will allow for sound and video output. \nIf you have a system that allows for digital audio, it is possible to use a DSP for passthrough from the iPad to the Sound Board, however one usually runs for around $100-$1400. \n", "Q: Got a new iPhone - where am I supposed to receive the verification code? I just got a new iPhone to replace my broken one. I can't really do much without signing into iCloud, which requires me to use a verification code. This can either be sent to some other trusted apple device of mine (no such device exists), or as a text to my phone (that won't work because I'm trying to set up my phone). So how can I sign in to iCloud?\n\nA: Don't log in during set-up, but login afterwards using Settings. At that time you'll be able to request an authentication code via SMS.\n\nA: iCloud only asks for a trusted device after you add and verify the other devices. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915\nBest be would be to log in to your AppleID on a computer and check your options, perhaps adding a friend or relative's mobile temporarily. Once you’re set, you can then decide if two factor is right for you with only one device. Keep in mind, iPad and Mac can be trusted devices, too in addition to a phone. \nIf that fails, you may have to work with Apple support to see if you have indeed locked yourself out of your account. Hopefully there is a fail safe like the enrollment email that's active for two weeks where you can opt out or work through the recovery process.\n", "Q: Why can't I sync Photos on my Mac with Photos on my iPhone? I keep a subset of my photographs in Photos on my Mac, and I would like to sync these with Photos on my iPhone. I used to be able to do so, but the option seems to have gone away. The 'Sync Photos' checkmark in iTunes is now off, and if I turn it on, the only option is to sync the phone with a selected directory.\n\nWhat's going on here? How can I enable Photos on the phone to sync with Photos on the Mac?\n\nA: The solution, it turned out, was to quit Photos then relaunch it while holding down the Option key. It then asked me to pick a system photo library and I re-selected the existing system photo library. Then when I launched iTunes, \"sync photos\" gave me the option of syncing selected albums from Photos, as desired.\nI've no clue what went wrong or why this would fix it, but it did.\n", "Q: syncronize icloud contacts with iphone contacts I have contacts on my iPhone6 that don't appear when I search for them in contacts on icloud (as in the website).  How can I get my phone accounts to get into the cloud?\nTried so far: went into iPhone Settings -> Contacts -> Default Account and selected 'iCloud'.  This apparently had no effect.\nI restarted my iphone and verified that 'iCloud' is still listed as my default Contacts account.  After re-loading icloud.com, still some contacts are not appearing.\nUpdate:  iOS version 10.3.2.  I also verified that contacts is turned on.  Changing the title to reflect that I don't see a problem with my phone -- the problem is that icloud is not seeing the contacts with my phone.  So the problem is icloud.  Of course, the broken link could be anywhere, including my phone.\n\nA: You didn't mention what version of iOS you're using so I'm assuming you're using the latest version.  Be sure you follow these directions from Apple's support page to setup the sync between your iPhone and iCloud:\nGet started\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you’re signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID on all of your devices.\n\n*Set up iCloud on all of your devices. If you have a PC, download iCloud for Windows.\n\n*Make sure that you're connected to Wi-Fi or have an active Internet or cellular connection.\n\n\nSet up iCloud Contacts\nWhen you turn on iCloud Contacts, all of the information stored on separate devices uploads to iCloud. If you turn off iCloud Contacts, your information won't automatically move from iCloud back to your device.\nOn your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud.

You can find and edit your contacts on iCloud.com or in iCloud for Windows. Any changes that you make automatically update on your other devices.\nIf you turn off iCloud Contacts on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac, your contacts won't delete from iCloud, they won't update automatically, and any changes you make won't update across your other devices.\n\nIf this doesn't work, follow the troubleshooting steps on this Apple Support page.  There's many steps to try and options to take so I can't list them in this answer.\n\nA: To test that basic contact syncing was working, I created a new contact on my iphone and observed that it quickly appeared on icloud.com.\nHowever, I still observed that a specific contact on my iphone was not appearing on icloud.com.  Based on a conversation with Apple Support, some contacts are impossible to sync if they originated with some other app such as Facebook or WhatsApp.  \nI don't remember the origin of my 'problem contact', but I re-entered it manually and that solved the problem.  The Apple Support person suggested that manual re-entry is the easiest method that exists. \n", "Q: Can the macOS keychain generalize across all iOS apps? Why can't I access my keychain in iOS apps other than safari (or OSX apps, for that matter?). How can I access my passwords across the entire platform?\n\nA: Apple simply hasn't opened access to the Keychain to third-party apps. However that is changing in iOS 11. You'll be able to use your Keychain passwords across the system then.\n\nA: You can access the full keychain by opening Keychain Access on Mac, which may be found in the Utilities folder. On iOS, you may access the keychain from settings under Safari within “Passwords”, however the API for the keychain has not been opened for developers.\nNormally, you could access the relevant password if it’s is for an app distributed by the authority that also manages the web app, for example, Amazon, or any of the Google apps that pull keychain info with the permission of the user through the use of a safari window within the relating application to retrieve the API key for the app. \nIn iOS and macOS releases coming this fall, the feature will be built into the system, and apps will be able to access the keychain without using a window. \n\nA: It's a design feature of the keychain system in macOS and iOS. Each keychain item is stored with a unique identifier that tells the system which application created it, and only that application is allowed to access it. There is also a concept of access groups, where a developer can allow access to a group of applications, for example so that Google only needs to store your credentials once to be used by all their apps.\n\nIn addition to globally locking and unlocking the entire keychain at\n  appropriate times, the system also restricts which apps can access\n  specific keychain items. By default, an app that creates an item, and\n  only that app, can read it back or modify it. However, sometimes you\n  want to share a secret among apps. How you do this depends on the\n  situation.\n...\nFrom a high level perspective, Keychain Services uses an app’s code\n  signature with its embedded entitlements to ensure that only an\n  authorized app can access a particular keychain item. By default, only\n  the app that created an item can access it in the future. But Keychain\n  Services does more than simply check the identity of an app. Instead,\n  it compares a keychain item’s access group, recorded as the\n  kSecAttrAccessGroup attribute, with the list of access groups to which\n  an app belongs. If one of the app’s access groups matches the keychain\n  item’s group, access is granted. Similarly, Keychain Services allows\n  an app to create keychain items with the kSecAttrAccessGroup attribute\n  set to any of the app’s own access groups.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/keychainServConcepts/02concepts/concepts.html\n", "Q: Wrong indentation and spacing for manual pages in terminal I am wondering why the manual pages in the Terminal app look like shite on my Mac running macOS Sierra 10.12.5? \nIf I run the command man grep for instance I get a crappy layout of text in the terminal window (black terminal). But if I right-click grep and choose open man page then I get the properly formatted version (yellow terminal) of the manual. \n\nHow can I resolve this?\n\nA: Right-clicking a command and choosing open man page in the Terminal window uses the \"Man Page\" profile in the new Terminal window. In your current white-on-black profile you've set bolded text to black instead of white or another color. Therefore the bold text isn't visible on the black background.\nChoosing yellow instead of black as color for bolded text in the Man Page theme would result in a similar crappy display of the grep man page:\n\n", "Q: Standard backup solution for my Apple devices I have a few Apple devices (iMac, MBPs etc) in my home. All my devices are SSD backed and therefore I had to sacrifice in capacity. It occurred to me that I could have a secure central data storage machine that could be accessed over the network in home and it could be HDD backed, and therefore not so pricey.\nA HDD backed device could keep all my movies, code, software installers, tutorials etc. and keep my \"interface\" devices' drives free.\nEssentially, I'm looking for a device that would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*always up and network accessible;\n\n*be secure (maybe by password protection); and\n\n*work as central data repository for my home.\n\n\nAirPort Time Capsule looks like such a device but its primary function is to serve as the storage space for backup of a computer. Additionally I thought I could buy a Mac Mini and connect it to my network and just use it as a data server. Am I thinking along right lines?\nCan someone help me to find an appropriate device for my use case?\n\nA: While iCloud is what Apple touts as the answer to your use case, a Network Attached Storage, aka NAS, is what could serve your needs in a way that gives you more control over your data and is also cheaper. \nFortunately, there are many NAS manufacturers that provide you with solutions that simultaneously act as central data storage (their primary function) and as the backing disk for Time Machine, effectively abstracting out the complexity of two devices from the user.\nThese devices can be connected directly to your router by an ethernet port. Depending upon the manufacturer's provided interface, you can set up a password controlled central repository for all your data and can keep a publicly accessible common data folder.\nBoth iCloud and NAS are hard drives in the end, but if you go with NAS it is up to you to care of the cons of NAS. The following cases are possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*NASes drive can fail.\n\n\nFor this, the solution is simple - get a dual drive NAS. That way you have two copies of your data on the NAS itself and the chance of losing your data (which will happen when both drives fail) is reduced significantly.\n\n\n*NAS may be slow.\n\n\nThe solution is straight-forward - use SSD backed NAS. But, since you have already mentioned that you have SSD in your devices and only need a central data repository for legacy and/or static data, going with a HDD may be good enough for you. Also, other reasons why NAS may be slow is because of encryption of data on NAS, firewall on NAS, too much traffic on your home network, a slow device in your computer to NAS connection (eg. slow router).\n\n\n*NAS can get full pretty soon with all your data.\n\n\nMake a generous estimate of your space needs and purchase it correctly upfront. Remember that when purchasing dual drive NASes, often the actual capacity you get is half of what is mentioned by the manufacturer because second half is used for creating the replica.\n", "Q: Macbook pro13 (2015) Battery dropping significantly during sleep I went through articles, but I'm requesting an answer for my instance.

Here's a screenshot showing that a few hours after cleaning out the 30 gig system logs they are back at 6 gigs. Any idea of what's going on? Should I not have cleaned out system logs?\n\n\nA: Woah - your launchd is quite busy. Before you run any clean, I would save your work and do a shut down and then safe boot. The safe boot is when you hold the shift key after the startup chime sounds (or would sound if silenced).\nThis startup will take quite some time and it sets aside things link font cashes, all non critical kernel extensions / drivers / program start up.\nOnce the Mac is running - check on the activity monitor and grab screen shots to compare to yours above. After 5 minutes, you should have a very idle system. If not, disconnect from all networks and repeat the safe boot one time.\nAt that point, you’ll know if the core OS needs to be reinstalled if it’s not behaving in safe boot mode. If it does behave in safe boot, try a normal boot.\nNext up if the normal boot fails - try making a new user and setting that user to log in at boot and restart.\nSorry this isn’t a “do this to fix” sort of answer, but you’ll need to triage a bit to get a feeling if this is software related and user/OS software related.\nThe log files themselves don’t cause issues - it’s the configuration or changes you brought to the standard install that’s logging all the messages. Imagine a leak in the basement - clearing the logs is hiring a contractor to come pump it out, rather than figuring out what’s leaking in the first place.\n", "Q: Does macOS ship with software developed by third parties? I know in the days of Classic Mac OS, Apple had a habit of shipping the OS with pieces of software, often useful little utilities, that while on the face of it look like any other piece of bundled software, are actually written by third parties and simply paid for by Apple to be able to be included with every installation.\nIs this practice still followed? To clarify, I don't mean software written by a company which is then bought out by Apple and their software shipped; but software written by a company which remains independent, but is shipped with Mac OS.\n\nA: In short, yes.\nApple is built upon Open Source technologies.  \nFamiliar projects like Apache, Bash, CUPS, PostgreSQL, OpenSSH, Python, Xorg, and Zlib are all parts that make up macOS. For a full list, see the link above.\n\nOpen Source software is at the heart of Apple platforms and developer\n  tools, and Apple continues to both lead and make significant\n  contributions to many Open Source projects. Major components of Mac OS\n  X, including the UNIX core, are made available under Apple’s Open\n  Source license, allowing developers and students to view source code,\n  learn from it and submit suggestions and modifications. In addition,\n  Apple uses software created by the Open Source community, such as the\n  HTML rendering engine for Safari, and returns its enhancements to the\n  community.\n\nEven the underlying core OS is comprised of third party technologies - FreeBSD for the kernel, filesystem, and networking.\n\n(This is one of the reasons, I left Linux and went FreeBSD - there's a great deal of portability between macOS and BSD)\n\nA: Companies, not necessarily. Third parties, lots and lots. MacOS is a Unix variant and thus includes many, many command-line Unix utilities, very few of which were written by Apple, although they may have customised them. Just look in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin on any MacOS machine.\n", "Q: How can I force macOS to show the window of a program that I know is open but won't appear anywhere? My problem arises because sometimes I'm doing something on my MacBook and the user session logs out, as if I'd restarted the computer. Normally it's something exerting that must overload my RAM, like navigating and suddenly opening too many windows (e.g. I was looking for flights and the option was checked to automatically open windows to look in 4 or 5 more different sites).\nThe thing is, if I have something open like a game, or a half-filled form on Safari I wouldn't wanna lose progress on, like this question... I know that the program stays open because I've been able to still hear the game music and sounds in the background, as if nothing had happened. \nSo what I was wondering, is if there is a way to force macOS (10.12.5) to forcefully show a window that is not appearing on the dock, mission control or anywhere else.\nBy the way, the only way I've been able to restart said program, the game for example, has been by terminating the process on the activity monitor.

To do this, follow these instructions:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Locate the application package file for the program in question.\n  \n*Right-click and choose \"Show Package Contents.\"\n  \n*Navigate to the \"Contents\" directory within the application and open the \"Info.plist\" file in a text editor.\n  \n*Add the following lines to the file (the easiest location is to place them immediately after the <dict> tag, before the first <key>\n  tag at the top of the document):\n<key>LSBackgroundOnly</key>\n<string>True</string>\n\n  \n*Save and close the file, and close the application package windows\nAfter doing this, the program should now launch behind others at all\n  times, and then only be brought to the front if you click a window for\n  the program. As a word of warning, editing the contents of\n  applications will break their code signature, which is required for\n  some applications to automatically work with system services like the\n  application firewall. Without an intact code signature, the system may\n  always ask for you to allow applications through the firewall when\n  they are launched, which may be a bit of an inconvenience.\n  Additionally, this may not work for all applications, but it not then\n  you can easily remove the added lines to restore full functionality to\n  the program.\nThe second option for affecting a launching program is to develop a\n  script that will launch it in the background. The basics for this\n  script are to use the \"open\" terminal command, with the \"-g\" flag in\n  the following manner (using iCal as an example):\nopen -g /Applications/iCal.app\nAs an alternative to providing the full path name to the application,\n  you can use the \"-a\" flag as well and then only supply the application\n  name, such as the following:\nopen -ga iCal \nWith these commands, you can set up a launcher for your programs\n  either using AppleScript or Automator, where the script runs this\n  command as a shell script to target the application of choice. For\n  example, to create a script that will always launch iCal in the\n  background, open Automator and create a new application workflow. Then\n  add the \"run shell script\" action to the workflow and paste one of the\n  above commands into the action's script field. Then save the workflow\n  and when you run it, iCal should open behind your current application.\n\nOne caveat appears to be that the application can not be closed properly, i.e. its process is still present after closing it.\n", "Q: Can't load data from the Apple Software Update server I can't seem to access software updates on my Mac.

(Preliminary remark: I'm not entirely sure if this type of question, about hardware damage, is encouraged on this SE site. Apologies if it doesn't belong here.)\nThe screen of my MBP Retina 13' (early 2015) started showing some odd 'stains' a few days ago, covering about 20% of the screen. Didn't think much about it, until I read about 'Staingate' later (silly name, but oh well).\nHere's my problem/question:\nI'm not sure if what I have is actually damage to the coating (i.e. 'staingate') or not.\nOn the one hand, the stains looked similar to those on the pictures people posted. \nHowever, before I read about the possible coating issue, I was able to remove these 'stains' with a soft, clean microfiber and some warm water. \nIt took a while to completely do so, basically, rubbing persistently for a while, but without using force, just light pressure.\nI am wondering now if (a) these were just regular (but rather persistent) stains, and I simply cleaned the screen, or (b) if I rubbed off what I thought were stains, but in reality, was some screen coating.\nIs there any way I can determine this? \nFor example, how would I be able to tell if my screen lacks the coating? Can you usually see your own reflection in a coated screen if the screen is turned off? I can do so now, but don't recall if that was always the case.\nThe machine is still under warranty, and if it is in fact screen damage, I will try to get it covered. But before going to the store, I was hoping I could first determine if it's worth/necessary to go there, hence, this question.\n\nA: (disclaimer) I'm answering my own question, just in case someone else faces a similar problem, even though I realize the question itself maybe never really belonged on this site.\n\nI had a chance to compare the screen of my Macbook Pro Retina with another (identical) model that does suffer from actual stains, i.e. partially removed anti-reflection coating.\nThe good news is that, apparently, I did in fact only 'rub off' some very solid dirt, that only looked like the 'stains' that some people see on their damaged screens.\nHow do I know the other one had a damaged screen?\nWhen I cleaned my screen, I removed some 'silvery' stains, revealing a dark, almost totally black color of the screen/glass. In the case of the other, damaged Macbook screen, the opposite was the case: cleaning/rubbing seems to have removed the dark parts of the screen, and revealed the silvery stains.\nHow to tell if the coating has peeled off or not?\nIf you're unsure, the coating is (in all likelihood) still intact.\nThe silvery stains are very noticeable, and while I couldn't tell whether the other screen seemed more reflective or not, I could tell definitely that the stains are not even nearly dark in any way. In other words, when I removed the dirt (as I know now) from my screen, the resulting dark color of the screen when turned off, while not perfectly black perhaps, is drastically different from the damaged parts of the screen, which I can only describe as 'dirty grey/silver'.\nWasn't that kind of obvious in the first place?\nMaybe. I'm a bit slow sometimes.\n", "Q: How do I make `Cmd` as `Meta` instead of `Option/Alt` key on `emacs` runs on terminal(with `-nw` option) A lot of questions and articles about this but I can't find a one that works on my system.\nModifying emacs configuration looks working on other people's but it doesn't work for me.\nlike this\n\n(setq mac-command-modifier 'meta) ; make cmd key do Meta\n\nIs this working on your system too?\nCurrently I have no idea except just swap thos two keys using by third party app which I don't want to.\nPlease help!\n\nA: Programs running in the terminal are rather limited in what keys they can get. Gui apps get all the keys. Normally Cmd will go to the gui app only, because there's no ascii equivalent.\n\n\n*\n\n*Other people's configurations with mac-command-modifier (or ns-command-modifier depending on which version of Emacs you have) are for the gui version of emacs, Emacs.app.\n\n*Inside a terminal, it's the terminal app that decides what happens with Cmd. Typically Cmd is only used for the terminal's own features. Terminal.app offers no way as far as I can see to send Cmd to emacs -nw. If you're using iTerm2.app you can tell it to send option instead of left or right cmd, and then you can have option map to meta.\n\n*You can globally swap the two keys in System Preferences, but this will mean Cmd/Option are swapped in all other applications too.\n\n\nRelated: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32074/cannot-remap-alt-cmd-on-mac-os-in-terminal and https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/7761/use-the-command-key-in-terminal-on-osx/32480#32480\n\nA: I solved this problem on macOS 10.13.6 by creating a Profile in the Terminal app that maps the Option key to Meta.\nTo create a new Profile, open Preferences in the Terminal app and go to the Profiles tab.

Since last week however, it has stopped optimising and saving space locally on my phone.\nOne possible cause is the use of Google Photo's backup and sync function. I turned that on in Google Photos again after a long time last week in order to share an album with Android users. Google search suggests that Google photos would download the full res photos from iCloud in order to upload them. My iPhone's free space did plummet from more than 10GB free to now less than half a GB free.\nYesterday, I turned off backup and sync in Google Photo and later uninstalled the app. But Photo is still taking up 34GB of my local iPhone storage. Now I have 80/200GB free on iCloud, less than 500mb free on my phone, Photo app is telling me it has stopped updating because I am low on storage.\nI have kept my phone plugged in all night and on a fast wifi. The Photos storage remained at 34GB after 12 hours unfortunately.\nHow do I make the Photo & iCloud optimisation runs again to free up my phone storage?\nPS: My iCloud photo library is up to date. Yet in my iPad, my photo library is taking up less than 3GB of space. So somehow it has to be the full size download in my iPhone that is taking up a whooping 30GB of space. \n\nA: This happens on occasion. For some reason Photos stops removing full-resolution versions of photos. If your iCloud Photo Library is up to date, go into Settings / Photos & Camera and disable iCloud Photo Library.\nThis process may take a long time, and will leave all your full-resolution downloads on your device.\nYou can open the Photos app to see the number of photos decrease. Don't do anything until it's stabilized. Once it has, wait a few more minutes just to be sure, then delete all remaining photos. Remove them from Recently Deleted as well.\nYou can now reboot and turn iCloud Photo Library back on with Optimize Storage enabled.\n", "Q: I don't need as far as I know “Microsoft AU Daemon” so how can it be disabled? this message is annoying - can I disable it or remove the application as I only use Word, Excel and Powerpoint.

I have an older Macbook air and since upgrading to Mac OS Sierra get major performance issues. I see over 1000 threads in activity monitor and am trying to understand if it is due to iCloud drive sync process. CPU intensive tasks can freeze the mac, and operations take longer than expected\nIt is currently uploading 100,000 files to cloud. How can I reduce the priority of this upload to make sure iCloud drive threads have absolute lowest system priority possible and do not interfere with other processes?\nBonus question - how do I exclude folders from sync? \n\n\nA: Bonus question, Exclusion: In MacOS Sierra, you have one option in Apple menu > System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive Options > Desktop & Documents Folders - on or off. It's all or nothing, therefore you should reconsider iCloud for small files, for example I tried it with some .dotfiles and very soon dropped that idea as my CPU time was eaten up. \nSame goes for Dropbox (but my experience is 1.5 year old here, so maybe Dropbox is now better-handling small files) Other thing I tried was syncing .zipped files / containers - that was working fine but in after a while I droped that too- what I found best is TimeMachine \"set it and forget it\" config you can access from the outside.\nI know that it's not the answer you are looking for, I can only say from my experience, after few months of cloud syncing I put it on external solution where I sync a local drive and forget about it, QoS takes care of upload priority and file sync isn't my Mac's CPU problem.\nWorth remembering: if you start using iCloud, there is no way to delete certain files (which is absurd) - for example you can't delete files Applications leave in your User ~/Library, I know it sounds crazy, but just google for \"iCloud delete all preferences\" or similar\n", "Q: iMessage stopped syncing I have an iPhone (iOS 10) and a macbook (macOS 10).\nMy SMS/iMessages used to be in sync between my computer and my iPhone.\nAt some point, not sure when, they stopped syncing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Both devices are connected to my Apple ID.\n\n*Handoff is enabled.\n\n*iMessage is enabled.\n\n\n\n\nA: First of all, I've had a less than prefect experience with messages being delivered to both Mac and iPhone which I largely attribute to non-Apple devices. \nTo your problem, have you tried un-ticking phone numbers/email accounts and signing out on both devices? Quit app then re-lauching and signing back in?\n\nA: Is it ALL your messages that stopped syncing, or just SMS? If it's just SMS, on your iPhone open Settings / Phone / Text Message Forwarding and make sure your Mac is checked.

The method that got me closest to my goal is documented here:\nhttp://mydesignpad.com/how-to-create-an-attractive-html-email-signature-for-microsoft-outlook-2016-for-mac/\nThis approach works perfect when I add the signature in Outlook Web Access (owa). As to say the recipient sees the signature formatted as intended and the image is downloaded from a external server. Also the message shows no attachment clip in the inbox of whatever E-Mail client.\nBut when I add the signature to Outlook for Mac (Version 15.36) the embedded image is being downloaded before sending a E-Mail and gets included as an attachment. So the message does show an attachment clip in the inbox of whatever E-Mail client.\nDoes anybody experience same issues? Has someone found a solution/work around?\n\nA: Outlook works best with a restricted version of HTML for the signature, so if you can't use the webmail signature generator and copy / paste that into your Mac Outlook - look for a third party tool to assist.\nOne that works well is this utility from the App Store. It fixes the problem with Outlook breaking HTML signature.

I have a quick question about the Finder/Spotlight search.\nSo, as a grad student, I have tons and tons of PDFs on my computer. A lot of times, it's helpful for me to perform a keyword search to look for references (I often forget that I've downloaded relevant files), and Finder has done a perfectly serviceable job searching through file contents and through file names up until about the last week. Suddenly, about a week ago, I realized that Finder was only indexing search results that had the keyword in the file name. \nI've tried poking around in search preferences to no avail, and I've looked for forums addressing this problem online. I have seen plenty of people who want to search file-names and can't (i.e., they can only search file contents), but I have not seen my problem anywhere.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to what might be going on here and how I could fix it? I have even tried re-indexing the search results as suggested elsewhere on StackExchange as a general tip for people with faulty Finder searches, but that didn't do anything for me.\nThanks so much for your replies in advance!\n\nA: Solution:\nNavigate to System Preferences>Keyboard>Shortcuts>App Shortcuts\nPress the 'plus' (add) button\nIn Application, choose Finder\nFor Menu Title, enter \"Find by Name…\"  Do not use the \"\" and you must use an ellipsis (…), not three periods (...).\nEnter your desired keyboard shortcut.

I then repeated the process, adding a keyboard shortcut the the Finder of CMD-OPT-F for Find.\n\nA: This doesn't solve your problem but until you do, you could use the free app EasyFind. This mac app lets you set your search parameters. You can search file names or content. You can search a certain folder or whole disk. It does a very fast search. It's available at the app store. This app could help you until the finder search is fixed. You may like it better than finder search, it has many options.\n\nA: Don't do it through Spotlight.\nGo to Finder and hit ⌘F. You should see your standard Finder window, but with two new rows at the top. One says \"Search:\" with two buttons, \"This Mac\" and the current folder. The default is to default to the current folder, but you can change that in Finder preferences (⌘,), at the bottom of the Advanced tab.\nThe second row is the important one, in which you can filter by things like name, the last time you opened the file, and, more pertinent to our discussion, its contents. I'm running Sierra, and on my computer, the default is \"Name.\" Though I'm positive the default was once \"Kind\" (file type), I'm not sure when the switch occurred, so I'm not sure which one your computer shows. Either way, click on that drop down and select \"Contents.\"\nThe row will now change to say \"[Contents] contains\" and an empty box. Type in what you're looking for in that box.\nIf you're still getting a lot of files in your search results, you can hit the little + and add another criterion to filter by \"Kind,\" then select \"PDF.\"\nNotice that you can also hit the \"save\" button all the way to the right of the row beginning with \"Search:\" and save your search as a Smart Folder and place it in your sidebar.

Why would adding Macintosh HD to the path cause the script to error out?\n\nA: If you are hardcoding, without testing if the file exists, then use the following example:\nset foo to quoted form of \"/Users/vader/someapp.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/foobar.txt\"\nset bar to quoted form of \"/Library/Application Support/\"\ntry\n    do shell script \"cp \" & foo & space & bar with administrator privileges\nend try\n\nIf you are calling it from the script within the application bundle,  then use the following example:\non run\n    try\n        set foo to POSIX path of (path to me as string) & \"Contents/Resources/Scripts/foobar.txt\"\n        set bar to quoted form of \"/Library/Application Support/\"\n\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            if exists file foo then\n                tell current application\n                    do shell script \"cp \" & quoted form of foo & space & bar with administrator privileges\n                end tell\n            end if\n        end tell\n    on error eStr number eNum\n        display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with icon caution\n        return\n    end try\nend run\n\n\nNote: When working with the do shell script command, POSIX pathnames must be used, not aliases. Macintosh HD is not valid in a POSIX path, just in an alias. In a POSIX path of the startup disk, everything starts in the root of the volume: /\nExample:\ntell application \"Finder\" to get name of startup disk as alias\ntell application \"Finder\" to get POSIX path of (name of startup disk as alias)\n\nReturns:\nMacintosh HD \n/\n\n\nA: @user3439894 has already explained how to solve the problem; I'd like to take a stab at explaining why the confusion exists. It goes back to the fact that the Macintosh OS wasn't always based on unix (/POSIX). Back before OS X (which is unix-based), Mac OS was a completely different OS with its own file path notation. When OS X came out it had to support both the unix file access APIs (which used unix path notation) and the traditional Mac OS APIs (which used traditional Mac OS path notation). Over the years, OS X (/macOS) has deprecated some of the traditional Mac OS APIs and switched more and more towards pure unix path notation. But AppleScript is an exception: it predates OS X, so it natively uses the old traditional Mac OS notation.\nHere's a summary of the differences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unix (/POSIX) paths use \"/\" as delimiters (and allow \":\" within filenames), while Mac OS paths use \":\" as delimiters (and allow \"/\" within filenames).\n\n*Unix paths are absolute if they start with the delimiter (\"/\"); Mac OS paths are absolute if they do not start with the delimiter (\":\").\n\n*Absolute Mac OS paths start with the volume name, while absolute unix paths start at the top of the root volume, and other volumes appear as folders somewhere under it.\n\n\nHere are some examples:\nMac OS: Macintosh HD:Users:vader:someapp.app:Contents:Resources:Scripts:foobar.txt\nUnix: /Users/vader/someapp.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/foobar.txt\n\nMac OS: Other disk:daily notes:7/19/2017 meeting.rtf\nUnix: /Volumes/Other disk/daily notes/7:19:2017 meeting.rtf\n\nMac OS: :Documents:file.txt\nUnix: Documents/file.txt\n\nIn AppleScript, you can use POSIX path of and as alias to convert between these.\n\nA: Your original script specified \"cp Macintosh HD ...\", but use /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD ... instead.  Also, it's best to put a backslash before any blank, as I did above before HD.  That would be true for 'Application\\ Support' as well\n", "Q: How to record system audio? (Soundflower not working) I've been trying to record some system audio from my computer while screen capturing in Quicktime Player. The thing is, I've done this before.

I want to add folder from launchpad, is it possible? I tried but coulndt put anyway. Is there an app or anything for this?\n\nA: Folders can be added to dock but they must be added to the right of the separator bar. Apps go to the left of the bar and files/folders to the right. The separator bar is the small verticle line on the dock.

Are you positive the power cord is working? Try different plugs, different laptops, different power cords. Test this thoroughly as you don’t want to go through the rest of this answer just to find out it was a bad cord/outlet. If nothing in the above works, keep reading.\nBased on your symptoms, and assuming the second power adapter is functional, it sounds too me like a bad MagSafe DC-In board. This is the board that collects the power from the MagSafe cable and transfers it to the battery. I’d suggest 1) running Apple Hardware Test with the adapter plugged in to test this. If the power test comes back faulty, and you’re reasonably sure that the cable is working, the MagSafe board is your most likely problem. If you feel comfortable with DIY repairs on your laptop, check out this iFixit page where you can find the replacement part for ~$25 USD.

Good luck!\nPlease don’t hesitate to add comments/edits if you think this answer is wrong, incomplete or needs clarification.\n\nA: That tester you show is not for testing the output from the magsafe - my first concern is that with the size of its blade it is all too easy to connect two of the small terminals together - and from your description of \"it sparked\" then that may be what has happened.\nI would not connect that power supply again to the mac, but I would replace it with a new one.\nOr, if you have a friend with a known good power supply test your mac with that and if all is fine then buy a new one. \n\nA: I would advise fully replacing your entire power supply with an apple original (look on craigslist or ebay for something less expensive), as this was a DIY-install, replacing only the cord on the power supply.\nAs many things could have gone wrong with the replacement, maybe a wire popped loose or something, I would advise not plugging this into your computer either.\n", "Q: How to \"killall\" Visual Studio Code in Terminal?

I've got my hands on Apple Emoji TTC from Sierra and I'd like to install it on El Capitan, but since Apple Emoji TTF on el Capitan is a system file, it cannot be moved into trash, disabled or updated. Is it a possible operation at all?\nI cannot upgrade to Sierra, but I'm also fed up with seeing symbols instead of emojis because my OS does not recognise them.\n\nA: Even if you replace the system emoji font, this won't help with all emojis. This is because some emojis are combinations of characters and this may not be interpreted correctly if the codepoints are new.\nIf you still want to replace the emoji font, you need to disable System Integrity Protection to replace system files.\n\nTo disable System Integrity Protection, you can do the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Boot into the Recovery HD by restarting whilst holding ⌘R.\n  \n*Open Terminal (from the Utilities menu).\n  \n*Run the following command in Terminal:\ncsrutil disable\n\n  \n*Restart.\n  \n\nSource: Disable OS X El Capitan Rootless and permit write actions to System Integrity Protection locations\n", "Q: How to use different SOCKS proxy for different CLI apps? based on some politics I cannot use proxychains* utilites ( no preload accepted ).

Is there a way to redirect all traffic to the SOCKS proxy per specified cli app? \n\nA: You may try TS-Warp, works natively on macOS, Linux, BSD.

It uses Firewall/NAT redirection instead of library preloading, so this plays the trick for macos with strict rules against preloaded libraries.\n", "Q: Executing commands in PS1 on macOS Sierra not working? Recently I had to switch to a Mac for my work. Since I'm used to Unix-like environments, I brought over my PS1 prompt generator from Ubuntu.\nI had enough trouble customizing the terminal for it to look somewhat usable (who thought that black letters on white background are an okay solution in 2017?). However one thing won't work...\nNamely, the git ps1 extension. Yes, I installed the bash-completion and git packages via Homebrew, and sourced both the git-completion.bash and git-prompt.sh before assigning PS1.\nMy .bash_profile looks like this:\nbuild_prompt () {\n  clear=\"\\[$(tput sgr0)\\]\"\n  blue=\"\\[\\033[38;5;27m\\]\"\n  green=\"\\[\\033[38;5;2m\\]\"\n  yellow=\"\\[\\033[38;5;11m\\]\"\n\n  export PS1=\"[${blue}\\u${clear}@${green}\\h${clear}] ${yellow}\\w${clear}$(__git_ps1 \" (%s)\") \\\\$ > \"\n} \n\n\nsource /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash\nsource /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-prompt.sh\n\nexport GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=yes\nexport GIT_PS1_SHOWCOLORHINTS=true\nexport CLICOLOR=1\n\nalias ls='ls -GFhAl'\nbuild_prompt\n\nAs you can see I add the __git_ps1 to the end of my PS1 value, and in theory it should display Git tree info whenever in a git repo folder.\nHowever this script is only ran once, when bash starts up. The same code however works on Ubuntu just fine, dynamically displaying git tree info no matter where I start bash. On this Mac, however, it only displays the value it picks up on launch, so if I start a bash prompt in a git folder, I'll be stuck with its info display until I close the terminal instance.\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n\nA: With a minimal test case (minus, of course, the frivolous colors) it appears that the quoting of PS1 is important:\ngitfoo () {\n    echo >&2 \"was run\"\n    git status -bs 2>/dev/null | head -1\n}\n#PS1=\"x$(gitfoo)x \"\nPS1='x$(gitfoo)x '\n\n", "Q: Applescript to get track number of song from multi-cd album in iTunes? I have an Applescript that reports the currently playing song name, album, song number, and total number of songs on the album. If the album comes from a single CD or if the song comes from CD 1 of a multi-CD album, everything works, and I get the following:\nSong 2 of 30\n\nHowever, if the album comes from a multi-CD set, then the song number is incorrect for songs from CD 2, CD 3, etc. Here's an example: L'Elisir d'Amore has two CDs, and in iTunes, it is entered as such (e.g., CD 1 of 2 and CD 2 of 2). The script correctly reports there are 30 songs (16 on CD 1 and 14 on CD 2). When playing a song from CD 1, everything is accurate. When playing a song from CD 2, the song number begins again at 1, so the very last song appears as\nSong 14 of 30\n\nbecause it is the 14th song on CD 2. Is there a way to get the script to display Song 30 of 30 for the last song on CD 2 without some kludge of figuring out the number of CDs, then counting up the songs in CD 1 and then adding to the track number of the song in CD 2? This kludge gets quite ugly for albums spanning as many as 14 CDs.\nHere's the simplified bit of code:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    -- code to check that there is a current song\n    set z_album to album of current track as string\n    set z_num to count of (every track whose album is z_album)\n    set z_song to name of current track as string\n    set z_trk to track number of current track\n    log z_song & \" (\" & z_trk & \" of  \" & z_num & \")\"\nend tell\n\n\nA: Personally I do not have much of a need, if any, to automate iTunes with AppleScript. In the past I've found iTunes to be one of the more difficult apps to automate. Nonetheless, I took a look at your code, the AppleScript Dictionary for iTunes, a few web searches that basically yielded nothing noteworthy, and some failed programmatic attempts to easily get a list of discs and track count for each disc of an album.\nI'll assume the kludge context in your question is because there is no easy direct way to programmatically ask an album for its disc count and track count per disc to do the math with, in a straight forward manner.

If it was left as a part of value of the variable theAlbumsDiscNumberTrackCountInfo, that's (re)set by the return of the do shell script command, then word 2 of paragraph i would have to be word 2 of paragraph (i + 1) in order to skip the leading blank line. So it makes more sense to remove it before it ends up as part of the final value of the variable theAlbumsDiscNumberTrackCountInfo.\n\n\n\n*With the variable, theAlbumsDiscNumberTrackCountInfo, now only containing a list of disk number with its corresponding track count, one line for each disc in the album, it's now easy to do the math, whether the album contains 2 discs or as many as 14 discs, or more.\n\n*The remaining AppleScript code, which includes another repeat loop, preforms the math necessary to add up the track count of each disc number preceding the disc number the current track is from, and adds them together, and then logs the desired information.\n\n\n\nThat said, if anyone knows an easy direct way to programmatically ask an album for its disc count and track count per disc to do the math with, in a straight forward manner to avoid a kludge, please post an answer.\n", "Q: How to turn off autocorrect for iPhone 6 Mail?

I have run disk permissions, and even installed a new OS using recovery mode, i can however open iCloud prefs using another user account on the same computer, any ideas anyone? \n\n\nA: Well you have already given us the first clue as to where the issue is:\n\ni can however open iCloud prefs using another user account on the same computer\n\nWhile it is possible that a combo updater will fix the issue it is more likely (IMHO) something specific to your user profile. How I would do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the Option key while in Finder and select \"Library\" from the Go menu.\n\n*You want to look for items with \"icloud\" in their name and move them elsewhere. I usually use the desktop or a folder on the desktop.\n\n*There will be files in \"Preferences\" and \"Application Support\" and possibly elsewhere. Don't remove the folders, just any files within making note of the path each file was at.\n\n*It is possible that there are other files in the same locations that deal with iCloud. poke around and move ones that might qualify.\n\n*Once that is done, reboot and try opening that preference pane.\n\n\nNote that you don't just delete the file in case the law of unintended consequences rears it's ugly head. So if things get worse put the files back. But I am betting that won't happen.\nI am thinking that there is a damaged preference or icloud support file somewhere in your user folder and \"/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/\" is the most likely place for said file to be.\nA reboot should cause  macOS to rebuild the missing files and opening the iCloud preference pane should finish the job.\nNote that it is possible that you will need to re-enter your iCloud account information once you get it working.\n\nA: Try to go Preferences, then Internet Accounts and then disable and re-enable the iCloud. That worked for me. \n\nA: Go to applications/utilities and run the console.\nOn the left select 'system log'\nHopefully errors are not happening so fast messages are flying by to fast to see or it will be harder to find what you want.\nMake sure System Preferences is closed.\nClick Insert Marker in the menu bar.\nOpen System Preferences.\nClick Insert Marker in the menu bar.\nClick to open the iCloud pane.  Let it put up banner, crash, etc.\nClick Insert Marker in the menu bar.\nClose System Preferences.\nClick Insert Marker in the menu bar.\nSelect all the messages from and including the 1st and last markers.\nYou can file, save selection as, and it will save a log file you can click on and open with the console to read it.\nOr copy the selected text and past it into a text file.\nRead what happened, it will give you a clue or even tell you exactly.\nOften there are permission issues and a file could not be written to or read.\n\nA: I think it happens once you modify the computer, as in change the HDD to an SSD and then use time machine to get all your data back. My iCloud preferences pane was not opening, my messages and FaceTime were frozen as well.\nI had created a new admin account, signed out of my old iCloud folders and basically started afresh with a new user account and viola, all is working. \n", "Q: What is com.onlineapplicationrequest.AppRequest?

Suddenly half the files in a directory have gone missing.\nA few months ago I copied the files onto an external drive. On discovering the files were missing, I went to copy these old files back to the same directory that has been partially emptied by Paragon HFS+, using OS X Sierra Finder.\nHowever, when I try to copy in the files from a backup, the copy stops, saying there is already a file with that name in the destination folder. Yet the file is not visible with OS X Finder or using the ls -a command.\nThis gives me hope that the files do still exist on the drive. Somehow, while they are found by the OS X copy command, they are hidden from ls, sudo ls -a, and the Finder GUI. So I cancel the copy, hoping to find a way of recovering the data.\nAny ideas how can I recover my hidden files?\nHow might they be visible to the copy operation but invisible to ls -a?\nI have been trying to get help from Paragon's customer support. After 4 days they told me to uninstall and reinstall their software - it is as obvious on my support call as it is here that that is irrelevant to the issue. After another 4 days Paragon told me their software drivers cannot be to blame as they do not write to disks. I can't stop working for a week, so by now I have had to re-create the files.\nI was running Paragon's HFS+ software for just 13 days before this corruption happened, and this is the second bug I have tried to get support for (the first was the software refuses to register). Neither bug has fixes or solutions, and they have refused to refund, let alone help recovering my files.\n\nA: HFSExplorer was able to see and recover some of the files, but most were missing.\nParagon did refund my purchase, after a few attempts at looking at the output of OS X repair commands which showed errors, which apparently they tried to reproduce, and my refusing to send them a dump of my hard disk. I have had no problems with their OS X product to access NTFS drives, and have used that much more extensively.\n", "Q: Cannot manually delete favorites in Safari in iOS 10.3.2 I've got an iPad 4 that I use irregularly, so I was a bit slow to update it to iOS 10.3.2. Since doing so, I've found that Safari takes a few tries to start up normally, and, when I try to delete a site from Favorites after accidentally adding it twice, it freezes up for a moment, and may or may not close, but does not delete the bookmark. \nTwo attempts so far have successfully deleted a bookmark, but in both cases it was the most recent, and not the one targeted. Hard resetting doesn't seem to help.\nFrankly, I'm a n00b when it comes to Apple devices, so any advice would be appreciated.\n\nA: It's going to be very difficult to troubleshoot this based on the info you've provided.  \nHonestly, the iPad 4 is considered 'old' (introduced in 2012).  It does support the iOS version you're using but, like a 102 year-old man, it will struggle with some seemingly basic tasks like putting his pants on and using a spoon, simply because it's old.  \nIf a reset didn't help, your only option might be to buy a new(er) device.\n", "Q: Is it possible to recover a formatted macOS partition Backstory: After I went to the Apple Store today, the drive in my Mac was wiped by an employee as I was supposed to have it replaced. The replacement unit had an issue though, so they gave me my old machine back with the SSD already reset to factory. \nAs the employee probably just used the DiskUtil UI to wipe the drive, I was wondering if there was any way for me to get my data back by rebuilding the HFS volume tables back to their previous state for instance. Using a backup would take days to get everything back and I want to try the other options before restoring a backup that would corrupt the data and prevent any further recovery.\nSmall issue: I only have a Sierra Recovery USB stick, so I can only use the terminal with whatever is already installed, like gpt, diskutil or pdisk. TestDisk for instance doesn’t work as it seems like it’s lacking some dependencies in this recovery environment. \n\nA: There are several professional, commercial data recovery options.\nOne is DiskWarrior, as an external boot media, which can recover corrupted file systems. However, as your file system was completely wiped, you will need to do block-by-block scanning of the raw data.\nDataRescue is the tool of choice here. Starting it from a different Mac, connect your current machine via FireWire or Thunderbolt in target disk mode (start the current machine while pressing and holding the t key). It will show up as an external drive on the other Mac. Select the drive as source in DataRescue and run a full scan. This will take hours. After it finishes, you can choose which of the reconstructed files should be saved to a new location.\nDirect manipulation on-disk is not possible, especially not now that a new OS appears to have been already installed. Without the partition table and metadata information, data is just on the disk but in an unusable way. That's why modern filesystems save the metadata information to several locations on the disk, so it is more likely to be recoverable even when the sector containing the superblock is damaged. But wiping the information manually wouldn't even help there.\nSo your best bet is reconstructing files with DataRescue. You could also ask your cloud backup provider to send you your data on disk. It will be quite expensive but if the data is important, just do it and consider it a hard-learned lesson for the future.\n\nA: If you have a backup, that's the way to go. How big is the drive? It should restore it in less than 12 hours with a USB2 connection. If you are restoring from a cloud backup, it will take a long time. But it's still probably your best option.\nYou can try to find a data recovery tool, but SSD drives have garbage collection routines that frequently wipe \"deleted\" data. If the drive got reformatted, and then had the OS reinstalled, everything is likely gone. In any event, it's probably too much hassle to bother with unless you don't have a backup for some reason.\n", "Q: Can I install iOS 11 beta ipsw using iTunes without paying $99? I want to go for beta, but OTA updates are quite buggy, and on top of that, my phone doesn't see ota updates with beta profile installed.\nSo I found ipsw image about 2,4GB, that I can download. If I flash that rom via iTunes without enrollment of my Apple ID, will I be able to use that beta?\n\nA: The free public beta program seems much safer and more reliable than trusting a download and/or needing to jailbreak.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\n", "Q: Sierra meets El Capitan OS installation issue I tried upgrading the software on my Macbook pro from OS El Capitan to Sierra.\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded software and was installing it.

Once restored, delete unnecessary files, making sure this time you have enough space available, then try again to update to macOS Sierra.\n", "Q: AT&T iPhone Parental Controls 2 kids with iPhones... Parent wants to setup controls. The two things I've seen are \n\n\n*\n\n*SL (SmartLimits) for AT&T \n\n*PC (Parental Controls) on the iPhone.\n\n\nUsing SL would limit Time, Numbers, Data, etc from the phone itself... while the PC would limit access to stuff like porn and other bad sites within Safari.\nIf I use PC do I still need to pay for SL? Does SL do web filtering (IE: XXX) now or does it still not block Safari? Are there any limitations to using these two together? \nAre there any other options worth noting? Or is it really limited these two options?\nEdit: \nAs a clarification... Parent has 2 \"tweens\". Boy & Girl. Associated issues - XXX, \"Sexting\", up late, using during school hours, etc. They aren't \"Technically minded\" so trying to look into \"simple\" options.\nWhat I see available is SL and PC... but neither seems a silver bullet. Neither also seems to offer super-granular control (Which is, I guess, okay for non techies) nor all the options in one place (SL can't block Safari and PC doesn't seem to have hours of operations, that I can see).\nFor example, one specific question is \"How do I block Instagram after 10?\". Personally, I would block data on the phone via SL - but that doesn't block WIFI access to those services if I'm not mistaken.\nSo... my \"edit\" is more... how does one handle \"Parental Controls\" and are there any \"all-in-one\" options? If not, SL & PC it is... SL for texting/calling/cell-data during inopportune times... PC for more control of the iPhone and applications such as Safari - but not super-granular such as \"Block Instagram after 10\".\n\nA: It depends what you want.\nIf you simply want to block apps, websites, and have (a little) control over data use, iPhone restrictions may be all you need.\nBy going into Settings > General > Restrictions > Websites, you can choose which sites you’d like to block from the phone. This works over both WiFi and Cellular.\nYou can also disable the App Store to prevent downloading of apps, or set an age limit on the apps downloaded.\nAnother thing you can do is configure your Cellular Data settings then lock the pane by selecting Don’t Allow Changes in Restrictions > Cellular Data Use\nThe main thing that AT&T parental controls would be good for is controlling what happens on your mobile data. In iOS controls, you cannot restrict phone numbers called, though AT&T can. Also, the AT&T app allows you to restrict cellular use during certain times of the day.\nIn conclusion:\nChoose iOS restrictions if you want control over their activities on WiFi AND Cellular. Also choose this if you want to restrict app downloads. (free)\nChoose SmartLimits if you want to have more control over your children’s activities over cellular. This is not limited to data, but also includes calls and texts.

Just keep in mind that you can't exceed  a certain resolution (I think it's 4K). Also, buy an hdmi dongle that is compatible (some cheap generic ones offer very poor sound and video quality)\nYou will be able to use as many apps as you'd like on both monitors simultaneously, and some programs (e.g. Photoshop) even allow you to spread them across multiple monitors.\n\nA: Yes! Simply drag and drop the program you want to run on the second monitor (make it full screen if you want by pressing the green button) - and now you can have two monitors, each displaying however many programs you’d like. \n", "Q: Emails being replace to Holiday in the United States? I recently started noticing that my emails were being replace to \"Holidays in the United States\" on the default Apple mail app. This is annoying because now I have to send emails from the browser.

Is there a simple encrypted file vault for iPhone and Mac that share the same content, w/o third party server?\nThis is the use-case: I have certain files (texts and images) that I want to be protected. On Mac, I can create encrypted disk and mount when I need the files. This works fine. However, what I want here is an app that works both on iPhone and Mac, since I want to use files on my iPhone as well. Preferably w/o third party, but if encrypted I allow using e.g. Dropbox etc.\nHere is a scenario:\n\n*\n\n*I open this vault on Mac. Put some file in there. Close the vault.\n\n*Things get synced\n\n*On my iPhone, I open the same vault and there I can browse files.\n\nThere are many apps that do this, but they are either for Mac OR iPhone. I want a solution that works across the devices.\nNote: I also considered the built-in Notes. But I can't upload my files (that are not just text).\n\nA: Cryptomator allows you to encrypt data stored in the usual clouds and access it from both Mac and iPhone.  \n\nA: If you don't want to use a third party server, then you need to look at open source solutions and host them on your own servers/platforms. Personally, I host Nextcloud on my own server and use their Mobile and Desktop apps to sync files from seamlessly. \nYou can also look into ownCloud (an older service from the creators of Nextcloud).\n", "Q: Why is Pages autocompleting / autocorrecting entries in my table? Why is this unwanted feature stealing my tab key? I am using Pages 6.2 on macOS 10.12.5. Within Pages settings, Auto-Correction > Correct Spelling Automatically is disabled. I unchecked the Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Check Spelling While Typing menu item. I unchecked the Edit > Substitutions > Text Replacement menu item. Within System Preferences, Keyboard > Text > Correct spelling automatically is disabled. Within Pages, if I select my document's table, open the Format pane on the right, and select Table, I don't see any options regarding spelling correction or autocompletion.\nMy Pages document consists of a table, with column A consisting of a list of languages, and columns B-K containing translations of the cardinal numbers zero through nine in that row's language. So this is a multi-lingual document, and any suggestions for spelling correction or text substitution are likely to be wrong, and are unwanted.\nLet's say I go to row 8 (8A contains \"Czech\"), column B, and type zer, assuming that this is the exact text that I want to appear there. I see a popup below this cell containing two values: \"zéro\", \"zero\". I want neither of these. What key do I press to dismiss the popup? If I press Esc, sometimes the cell is cleared and sometimes my entered text remains as intended. If I press tab, instead of advancing to the next cell, a selection row appears within the unwanted completion suggestions popup. I can click on the next cell (8C), however I should be able to complete my entry without using the mouse. After all, I disabled \"Correct spelling automatically\" in both applicable locations.\nI've found that I can press the right arrow key, then tab, to advance to the next cell without any autocompletion. However, this seems like more work than necessary given that I've disabled all autocomplete options that I can find. Since I am editing over 550 cells in this document alone, I want to do this as efficiently as possible.\nI also did a quick test of Numbers 4.2, and I experience the same problem with unwanted completion suggestions appearing in a popup below the cell that must be interacted with before the Tab key will advance to the next cell.\n\nA: Currently my best solution is to use the right arrow key to dismiss the autocomplete popup and advance to the next cell. However sometimes it requires one press, sometimes two. This is too inconsistent.\n\nA: Pages, Numbers, and Excel (untested in Word) all have this feature; what it does is look through that column of the table and, if there are any cells with the same starting letters as what you've typed in, will suggest them. This has nothing to do with autocorrect and everything to do with how accountants use tables, which seems to be the target audience of this feature (stupid as it may be, particularly so since it can't be disabled AFAICT).\nOne thing to note is that without some prompt to actually fill in the prompt, it will not actually fill it in. So, if you're up to ten and have previously typed in two and three, it will prompt you with those latter numbers as soon as you've typed t, but will quickly dismiss them once you add the e. It will also dismiss the prompt if what you've typed is identical (disregarding any accents) to what is contained in the prompt; for instance, typing in zéro when prompted with zero.\nIf you really want to get rid of it immediately, there's several things you can try, like using the left and right arrow keys (as you've already discovered), or adding a random character that doesn't continue the sequence in any cell in that column. The problem with this approach is when you want to continue, and there's more than one or two common letters among them. For instance, if you type in three and you've previously done the higher numbers, which include three hundred, you can't just do it once and be done with it; the table will prompt you on every character. For this reason I recommend this approach only if what you want to write is entirely contained within another cell, but not identical to it, and you've finished with your current cell.\n", "Q: Deleting space on my iphone/icloud If I am storing photos on my Dropbox or Google Photos, can I delete them from my iCloud and still access them through these other apps?\n\nA: Yes, those services are not connected.  \nHowever, once you delete items from iCloud, they'll be deleted from every device you have that uses that same Apple ID.  iCloud is a sync services whereas Dropbox and Google Drive are cloud storage that can also be used for backup.  \n", "Q: Uploading Photos to iCloud on iPhone 4 My iPhone 4 has many photos. I would like to have them all uploaded to iCloud, but I don’t have an option to enable iCloud Photo Library.\nHow can I upload all my photos to iCloud?\n\nA: The iPhone 4 is limited to iOS 7.1.2, which does not support iCloud Photo Library.\nIf your iPhone gets backed up to iCloud, then your photos are in iCloud, although you cannot view them at iCloud.com, or from another Apple device.\nIf you want your photos synced to iCloud Photo Library so that they can be viewed from iCloud.com and from other Apple devices, you will need to backup your iPhone, upgrade to a newer iPhone that supports at least iOS 8, and restore your backup onto that new iPhone. From there, you can enable iCloud Photo Library and sync your photos across all your Apple devices.\nAnother option is to export all your photos to a computer, then upload them to iCloud through a web browser at iCloud.com. To do this, plug your iPhone into your Mac, then press ⌘ cmd space and enter Image Capture. Select your iPhone, the photos you want to Import onto your Mac, and a folder. Do note that this is a manual process you would need to repeat on a regular basis.\nThe easiest option would be for you to upgrade to a new iPhone and use iCloud Photo Library.\n\nA: I've just had the same problem. What's App is no longer supported on my boyfriends iphone 4 so we had a panic buy of a pre-owned iphone 6 this afternoon. I'm transferring everything over for him but there is no option to upload photos to icloud.\nI've just started to try something. It's a little bit time consuming but it's working.\nBasically I'm sending batches of photos from his old iphone 4 (connected to wi-fi) to his new iphone 6 via the 'shared' cloud shaped icon option at the bottom of the camera roll page in the iphone photos library.\nWhen you select the 'shared' cloud icon for the first time, it tells you to give the shared album a stream name so I just called it part 1. Press Next. I then put my boyfriends email address in so basically I was sending it from him to him! Then select 'create' in the top right hand corner.\nIt will take you to your photos where you tick the ones you want to share and then select 'done'\nI was a bit unsure if it would work so I only sent 26 photos to begin with.\nI then opened the emails on his iphone 6 and you see a message asking you to subscribe to the album.\nClick on the 'shared' cloud icon at the bottom of your photo library page and you'll see a box with the photos. Bear with it. To begin with the box was white - it took a while to download all the pictures and they seem to appear in a mixed order but eventually they will all appear.\nTo send another set of photos, go into the 'shared' cloud icon again and it will show your previous shared album. Below it, you will see a pale grey box with a blue cross and 'New Shared Stream' next to it. Click on that and start compiling your next set.\nThe second time, I sent 36 photos from the iphone 4 to the iphone 6 and it took a bit longer. I was beginning to panic but they've eventually all arrived.\nSorry this is a bit waffly and I'm trying to remember how it worked because now I've set it up once it's easier. I now have hundreds more photos to send over but hopefully it will continue to work and I plan to send a larger amount next time.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: MacOS Sierra how to properly disable iCloud Drive? I got iCloud drive which hang in the middle of an upload, this is the 3rd day I'm looking at 6.52GB of 6.52GB. The task seems to eat my CPU and bandwidth and makes using the Mac an ordeal.\nHow to properly disable iCloud drive once enabled?\nWhat will happen if I click the blue remove from Mac button - will this erase my documents and desktop? \n\nCan I click stop updating and turn off? Will this keep my computer as-is?\n\n\nA: Always make a copy of your Documents & Desktop prior even thinking about disabling iCloud.\nIf you hit Keep a Copy button, what that button actually means is. \n\"I'll go ahead make new folders called Documents & Desktop, they'll be empty when you open them\" \nIt'll retain majority of your files in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud Drive folder.\nBy Some files, I mean some of the files will contain references to the files on iCloud drive. You'll see them appear normally in Finder but you won't be able to view them. \nFor example\nwall1.jpg in finder, if examined closely in Terminal is actually called .wall1.jpg.icloud  <-- any attempts to rename it from that file, will yield an empty jpg without any data in it.\nOne thing is certain, iCloud Drive / Backup relationship to your files is backwards.\nYour laptop should be Master where iCloud acts like a 'backup'. In reality iCloud is master and your laptop might or might not have full content of those files.\nAs far as 'Updating' I'd imagine it'd probably be good idea to let that run, to minimize the odds of not having all of the local files 'fully present'\n", "Q: Forticlient: SSL VPN timeout I'm using Forticlient to connect to a customer's VPN.

For this I bought an adapter that plugs in to the Mac's USB-C port, and supplies two USB 3.1 ports, one HDMI port and a power delivery for the USB-C power supply. The adapter is: Promate uniHub-C (https://www.promate.net/products/unihub-c)\nThe power supply works, when I plug in the power cable to the adapter, the computer charges.\nThe HDMI works with another monitor.\nMy external USB hard drive works, so the mouse/keyboard issue feels strange.\nWhen I have a USB keyboard plugged in, and an external hard drive - the System Report > USB shows as follows. The keyboard and the hard drive are both plugged in to the uniHub-C.\nIn the finder I see the hard drive though, seems to work well.\nScreenshot showing the System report\n\nScreenshot showing that the finder can find the connected hard drive\n\nHere is the problem: the USB slots doesn't seem to do much. When I plug in mouse and keyboard in the adapter, nothing happens. I was worried that perhaps I need another kind of USB-C => USB 3 adapter for regular USB devices to work, but I can't confirm that.\nHow can I verify I have an active connection in each USB slot?\n\nA: It looks like this particular product (uniHub-C) has its own idea about compliance to USB specifications. The designers seem to cut off the USB 2.0 part of the VIA hub design. First sign is that their marketing blurb doesn't mention support for legacy (HS, FS, LS) devices, which is strange - in marketing, more is merrier. Second, the web page shows some goofy \"USB Super-fast\" logo, which in no way corresponds to the official USB-IF certification logo,\n\nI suspect you fall for a wrong device.\n\nA: I have the same problem with this hub:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FX2LW35/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1#\nPeripheral connection doesn't work (power, display and network do), and seems to be known issue (search for peripheral or Logitech) in the comments.\nI connected another USB C hub in the other port in my Macbook and it indeed works.\nDongle hell. \nEdit: from the comments in the link above and elsewhere I have read, some of these USB C Hubs have a problem with input devices connected at the same time (power + something else) from the same Thunderbolt port in the Macbook.\nI have reached out to the manufacturer to see where the fault might lie, and if there is a mitigation. For now, using another hub without power/display in the other Thunderbolt port works.\n", "Q: How to get the temperature of MacBook hardware without extra software? We can use iStat Menus and other software. \nIs it possible to get the temperature of MacBook hardware components without extra software?

I am using an apple thunderbolt display and two mac pro's.  I would like to connect the two processors to the one display.  is this possible?\n\nA: No, you cannot physically connect both Mac Pro's to the same Apple Thunderbolt Display. However, you might look in to a KVM switch which lets one display connect to multiple computers. \nHowever, you could connect one Mac Pro to the display, and use Remote Desktop software on that Mac Pro to display the screen from the other Mac Pro.\n", "Q: How can i put selected images from photos app on macbook to the camera roll on iPhone 5?

I am aware of syncing an album through Itunes however they do not appear in the camera roll.\nIs there a simple method to transfer select images from photos to the camera roll? \n\nA: As long as both devices are in the same WiFi network and have Bluetooth enabled you can use AirDrop to send pictures between devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*select the photos to share\n\n*tap/click on the sharing icon (and select AirDrop)\n\n*wait for the target device to appear\n\n*send it over \n\n\nA: Get an app called “Transfer”\nPut it onto all your hardware, ie: phone, computer, iPad ect.\nOpen on both devices and select one to send and one to receive. They will sinc themselves. The receiving appliance you need to give approval.\nOpen photos and select photos you want to send.

MagSafe Adapter doesn't show green or orange LED while charging. LED display did not show any lights either.\nFollowing online instructions, when I opened it up and removed the battery connector and plugged the MagSafe adapter. Adapter started working well and LED lights too. \nI heard it boot up but nothing on screen. Puzzled, I hooked it up with a monitor and I could see my login screen but my keyboard and trackpad were not working as well so I could not do anything. I tried doing SMC reset from there that did not work either.\nAs soon as I put the battery connector back, it stays on only until I remove the MagSafe adapter even if battery is fully charged.\nHas anyone encountered a similar issue and solved it?\n\nA: It’s almost certain the battery is the failure here, but if you had access to a replacement part or didn’t mind spending money on a new MagSafe connector, you could try replacing that first.\nThe battery is almost certainly the cause dragging the voltage and/or current too low for the system to start. The chance the sensors that check the voltage and current are correct and it’s actually a low current and/or low voltage situation and swapping the battery with a good one would remedy that fault.\n", "Q: Dock icons not showing correct application icon Randomly my dock icons will show the default application icon. Sometimes they return again. I have previously reset the dock and deleted the .plist, which temporarily corrects the problem, but it returns soon enough. Removing and adding the app to the dock again also restores the icon, until the next time. It's tiresome to do this all the time, obviously.\n\nThe apps usually affected are the default Mac OS ones. The above screenshot shows my current situation: Mail, Safari, Reminders, iTunes and Terminal are not showing their icons.\nI didn't find much on Google by way of people complaining about similar behaviour. Is anyone else suffering, and can anyone suggest a more \"permanent\" solution?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: My most recent attempt seems to have worked, or at least several weeks have passed without the issue repeating, which it previously did within hours, or days at best.\nTry these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset PRAM and VRAM\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Restart in Safe Mode\n\n*Restart normally\n\n*Issue fixed? If not, go back to Step #3.\n\n\nThe restarting in Safe Mode is the key here. Resetting PRAM and VRAM is not enough; I had tried that previously multiple times, along with deleting various preference files and caches from ~/Library/ApplicationSupport etc. It didn't work. You may even need to repeat the Safe Mode boot more than once, but ultimately Safe Mode will hopefully sort you out if you are facing the same issue.\n", "Q: How to set a default user on the login screen without automatically logging in? I have more than one user account on my MacBook, but I'm almost always the one logging in. I don't want to have a click an icon or type my username. I do however, want my account to always be password protected. Basically, I want my account to be selected by default so all I have to do after turning on my computer is type in my password. If someone else needs to log in, they would press the back button,\n\nA: You can activate the \"require password\" option in system preferences:\n\nWhenever you are done working you can then just close your MacBook or set it to sleep (instead of logging out or shutting it down, which I assume is what you normally do). If you open it up again after the specified time you are prompted to enter your password, but you are still able to switch user.\nAchieving this behaviour after a complete shutdown however is not possible, i believe.\nEDIT: Maybe there is a way to achieve this after all, since that is precisely what happens after the installation of a macOS update (that required reboot) is finished. Maybe a specific boot flag that can be set or some config in a plist file...\n", "Q: Can an iPad become damaged by leaving it in a bathroom during and after a shower? I leave my iPad Mini 3 in my bathroom most of the time. If you must know, I enjoy reading my iPad while using the toilet.\nI take daily showers in this bathroom. Showering produces steam and increases the humidity in the bathroom. I run the bathroom fan after showering for about 10 minutes, like one should, to remove much of the humidity.\nThe bathroom is very small. While I never actually spill water on my iPad, I'm sure that it is exposed to the moist air.\nCan this moist air damage the iPad?\nCan the moist air find its way inside of the iPad, resulting in the formation of condensation inside of the iPad? I'm sure that the iPad was not designed to have water inside of it.\nThe bottom line: Is it necessary to remove the iPad from the bathroom every time that I shower?\n\nA: I take shower while my electronics are in the bathroom, and I've never had a problem. I also don't do any of what I've said below.\nThere's no verifiable easy way (for me at least) to answer this question with proof. If you'd like to minimize the likelihood of moisture damage and you don't want to remove the iPad from the bathroom (or you can't) there are three things I can think of that might help:\n\n*\n\n*Plug something into the headphone jack. That's what's most likely to cause a failure in the iPad from moisture.\n\n\n*Placing the iPad close to (but not on) the floor. The warm, moist air from the shower will collect at near the ceiling first.\n\n\n*Avoid rapid temperature shifts when leaving the bathroom. If the iPad does have some moist air trapped, the shift to a cooler area will cause the moisture in the air to condense into liquid water.\n\nA: I am reading this question on an iPad Mini 4 in the shower. I have been taking it into showers with me everyday for several months with no ill effects. I keep it at eye level using a 3M Command little metal shelf that is attached to the shower wall opposite from where the water comes out. It gets a little wet from when I touch the screen with wet hands. So far, so good (no issues). \nIt is pretty cool. I started using it mainly to play podcasts while I shower. I also use the camera as a mirror to shave, and it is sometimes nice to have access to a clock from in there as well.\n\nA: Dont ever leave your electronics in bathroom, I was listening to music while showering and my ipad was so far away from me now my ipad has this weird glitches and it wont turn on.

Is there a way I can install 64-bit Ubuntu Server, or any 64-bit OS for that matter, on this Mac? I'm getting tired of Snow Leopard Server.\nEDIT: Uhm, computer is silver and looks like a cheese grater. It's a Mac Pro 2006 (first gen) with a single 250 GB HDD (original), 2 GB DDR2, and 2 dual-core Xeons.\n\nA: There are instructions online that tell you how to replace the 32-bit EFI with a 64-bit version. Obviously this comes with certain risks and certain issues. Worth pointing out that I haven't tried this myself.\nhttp://lowendmac.com/2014/modernizing-the-mac-pro-11-and-21/\nIf you want to install 64-bit versions of Linux there are a number of resources online that explain how to accomplish this.

I recently saw that there are already UHD 4K Blu-ray drives (with SATA) available, like this one from Pioneer which should (combined with appropriate USB housing) make mounting the disks in macOS possible. So I was wondering if I can get UHD Blu-ray playback on my new iMac 5K 2017 working?\nConcerning hardware there should be no problem with its Kaby Lake processor (required for decryption) and HEVC hardware acceleration, right? The AMD Radeon Pro 580 should also support HDCP 2.2, however I'm not sure about the built-in display…\nRegarding software:\nAs of my understanding AACS 2.0 has not been cracked yet, so ripping is out of question at the moment. But there seems to be software for Windows which supports UHD BD playback, like the newest version of PowerDVD. However, I wasn't able to find an equivalent software for macOS.\nI found serveral \"guides\" and \"how to\"s, listing software they claim to support UHD BD playback (and even ripping), but none of the companys official websites advertise such a feature.\nHas anyone got playback of 4K Blu-Rays on the Mac working, tried it or has any experience on this topic whatsoever? Am I right about my assumptions regarding the hardware support?\nThanks in advance!\nP.S.: I hope this is the right branch to post this question to. Please redirect if it isn't.\n\nUPDATE: I just installed Windows 10 with Bootcamp and ran CyberLink's \"UHD Blu-ray Advisor\" to check my hardware. These are my results:\n\nI'm not completely sure what to take out of this. Either there really are hardware problems or it is just some compatibility/driver issue with Bootcamp (that maybe doesn't occur in macOS). The Intel i7 7700K does support Intel SGX according to Intel but the feature could be disabled...?\nIt most certainly means that playback with PowerDVD (also from CyberLink) in Bootcamp will not be possible (at this stage).\nCould it really be that HDCP 2.2 isn't supported due to the iMac's hardware? Does anyone know of a similar diagnostics tool for macOS?\n\nA: Yes, you can get UHD working through that blu-ray drive. Copyright decrypting, hardware acceleration etc are all features implemented in prior chips so they're definitely in  Kaby Lake. Display is HDCP 2.2.\nI think the biggest difficulty here will likely be in finding good software. I would plan on having to buy some, shop around and find the best one for you. I don't have any recommendations for software but I know that it should work & looking around there's at least some software that claims to do this.\n\nA: UPDATE 2018: I got this working a few months ago using MakeMKV (forum) and the \"Asus BW-16D1HT\" drive to rip the Blu-Rays and IINA for playback.\nNote: the iMac 5K 2017 doesn't have a HDR screen of course, so the colors have to be mapped.\n", "Q: Remove delimiter section from filename with Automator I'm creating an automator script that copies files from one folder to another and then runs an AppleScript to rename the file by splitting via delimiter and resaving with the second item. For example, using file names of:\n\n\n*\n\n*a new file$SG789.jpg\n\n*file_2$123-456.jpg\n\n*file_name$LG123.jpg\n\n*this_file$558-432.jpg\n\n\nI'm trying to split the filename by the \"$\" dollar sign to create the following new files:\n\n\n*\n\n*SG789.jpg\n\n*123-456.jpg\n\n*LG123.jpg\n\n*558-432.jpg\n\n\nHowever, when I run the script, I get the following error:\nThe action “Run AppleScript” encountered an error.

I read on another site that you can use macOS Internet Recovery to install macOS on a blank SSD? Where would the files be stored? On the firmware? If there any way that the firmware could be erased? (I.e. would running sudo rm -rf / on the disk also wipe the firmware or is it more complicated than that? Is there any way that the firmware could be erased?). I'm working on a disaster recovery plan incase I ran a stupid command like sudo rm -rf /.\n\nA: Long Version:\nThe code which permits Internet Recovery Mode (i.e. a slightly modified TFTP client) is stored in the computer's firmware. (In fact, it is a part of it). It's similar to the BIOS chip on Windows computers. When you boot through Internet Recovery, it will download a recovery partition image and load it into the computer's RAM. After this process, you will be able to boot into the normal macOS Recovery interface.\nShort Version:\nIf you were to wipe/replace your hard drive, Internet Recovery would automatically download and load a recovery partition image into the RAM, so you would be safe (as long as you have a backup of your data).\nPS.\nAlso, it is impossible to wipe the laptop's firmware with a simple sudo rm -rf / command.\nSource: Chat with Apple Support\n", "Q: |OSX 10.10.5] Script execution stops when screen locked? I was running a script that takes ages in Terminal.\nI wanted to run it unsupervised while I was working away from my MacBook, so I chose from the menu (top right) username > Login Window..., which is NOT logout, but the lock screen.\nI was expecting the script to run. When I returned hours later and unlocked the screen (by typing in my password), I had to find out that while the screen was locked the script was paused all the time, and just continued where it set off when I unlocked the screen.\nThe expected behaviour (known from other UNIX derivatives) would have been to run while the UI was locked and secure.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: EDIT: With macOS High Sierra (as of beta 5) you can achieve the same \"lock screen\" behaviour mentioned by @Phong simply through the  status bar menu:\n\n\nWhat I think is happening is that your computer goes to sleep after a certain amount of time after you switched to the login window which causes your script to stop.\nTo prevent your system from sleeping while your script is running you can run caffeinate -s in Terminal (note: only works on MacBooks if AC power is connected) or include it in your script. To stop the command hit CTRL+C.\nThe way I go about securing my account while I'm still logged in is to enable the \"require password\" option in system preferences:\n\nThen, as soon as the display (not the system) goes to sleep (also configurable in preferences) you have to enter a password in order to access the account.\nYou can also manually trigger display sleep by hitting CTRL+SHIFT+EJECT (if your keyboard has an eject button) or by running pmset displaysleepnow.\n\nA: You are right that Fast User Switching (activated by clicking Username → Login Window… does not log you out. However it does suspend actively running applications, thus preventing intensive tasks (or even media playback) from interfering with another user’s use of your system.\nWhat you want to do instead is lock your screen using Keychain Access.\nPress ⌘ cmd space, followed by Keychain Access to launch the app. Then from the menu bar, click Keychain Access → Preferences → General and check Show keychain status in menu bar.\nA padlock icon will appear in the system area of your menu bar.

I then ran it in Terminal and received the following error:\n./testcode:157:286: execution error: System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-1728)\n\nI then added Terminal to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility and ran it again. It then processed the script properly and returned:\nradio button Login Items of tab group 1 of window Users & Groups of application process System Preferences\n\nIt of course opened the System Preferences to that target.\n\nA: The key point in the linked answer is:\n\nWhen you first load or run the LaunchAgents you will get a prompt to set the Assistive Access in System Preferences. If you already have System preferences open you will not but the Script text file will be added to the list.\nYou now just have to check its check box to allow it.\n\nStep 1 is to open the security tab and allow your script app or the individual scripts permission to automate the interface.\n\nStep 2 - profit and avoid error -1728\n", "Q: automate file text edits I have an online website that I'd like to move to a new URL.\nTherefore I need to edit all website html files (100+ files) to update the URL links inside each file of this website.\nI'm thinking of making an off-line copy of the website files to edit.\nIs it possibile to use Automator OS X to\n- open each file in the website file folder\n- search inside the file content for a specific URL link (say \"www.website.com\") and change it to the new URL (say \"www.website.com/old\")?\nElse, do I need to rely on a text editor + Automator to make this process?\nOr, can it be done using a UNIX script that you run in the Terminal ?\nThanks for any advice on how to perform this process!\n\nA: Assuming all files are in the same folder:\nmkdir new\nfor i in *.html; do\n    sed 's|website.com|website.com/old|g' \"$i\" > \"new/$i\"\ndone\n\n\nA: If you're commonly editing website file contents you should invest in an editor.\nSublime Text 2\nDrop the website onto the icon and it will build the project:\n\nrun cmdshiftF and enter the replacement:\n\nClick the Replace button and verify the Replace:\n\nIt will open and change all the files:\n\n\nBBEdit\nIs an excellent and robust application I primarily use to edit code.

I recently bought myself a new Trackpad, since my old Magic Trackpad broke. Ever since, however, zooming (two finger pinch) gets stuck/disabled/not working somehow and, besides rebooting, the only simple solution is go to preferences → Trackpad and disable & enable PinchToZoom`.\nIt's very annoying, but also strange that his occurs suddenly. This shouldn't be happening. I can't find anything on the web regarding for a permanent fix.\nDoes anyone else do?\n\nA: Do you have Magnet installed?\nThat caused the same issue for me.\n\nA: Since you've already played with your System Preferences, I'd suggest testing to see if this happens while booted into Safe Mode, and also without any external devices connected, including both USB and Bluetooth.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Macbook into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Macbook\n\n*Restart your Macbook\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. does zoom work on the built-in trackpad when using Safari, Photoshop, etc)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Macbook as normal\n\n*Again, test to see what happens with zoom etc.\n\n\nNow, if after you've gone through the above steps you find that:\n\n\n*\n\n*zooming works during Safe Mode but not when you're logged back in normally, let me know.\n\n*zoom still isn't working during Safe Mode, then it's time to test your hardware with Apple Diagnostics (see below).\n\n\nNOTE: The steps below are for Mac models introduced from June 2013 onwards. If your Mac was introduced before June 2013, it uses Apple Hardware Test instead.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n\nA: All you need to do is go to system preferences > trackpad > scroll and zoom >  uncheck  Zoom in or out and then check it again.\n\nA: I had the same issue with the Rectangle app and restarting it does fix the issue. I added Figma and Sketch to the ignore list for this app so I'll see if this fixes it.\n", "Q: Will my calendar and contacts in iCloud be lost if I delete backups? I cannot do any new backups because my iCloud storage is full.\nI want to switch to using my computer for backups and delete the ones I have in iCloud. However I don’t want to lose my contacts and calendar that are also stored in iCloud.\n\nA: You can safely delete your backup from iCloud. To do this, go into Settings →  Your Profile →  iCloud →  iCloud Backup and turn the switch to Off to disable iCloud Backups.\nThis will only delete your iPhone backup from iCloud. It will NOT delete your iCloud contacts and calendars.\n", "Q: iPhone 6s restarts - apple offers a \"new one\" (refurbished) as exchange solution After having my iPhone 6s locked for 2-3 hours, sporadically (once per week) it presents the following problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*No response to home button\n\n*After pressing 1-2 times for 2-3 seconds the unlock button it shows black screen and the white \"waiting circle\" for 5-10 seconds\n\n*It comes back to life but every time this happens it is also asking the Pin for the sim card.\n\n\nI would not consider this as a restart or that the phone shuts down and it just starts again because when this happens it does not show the apple sign that normally shows up when the iPhone is completely restarted.\nI took the iPhone to Apple 3 times. We tried \"reset all\" etc but the problem consists and I also have problems with logging in/out in the iTunes (it freezes).\nSo this is where Apple offered me a refurbished iPhone. They started by telling me that it is new and when I saw the different case and started asking questions then they told me that the Battery, housing, motherboard, screen is new but it might contain old parts too. \nDoes someone have had the same experience with the turning circle.\nAnd would you recommend taking the refurbished from Apple? Bad experiences with refurbished phones from Apple stores? They give warranty 3 months, which is 1 more month than mine. (my warranty expires in September)\n\nA: Apple refurbished phones work great.\nI actually use one right now, since the battery on my old phone had expanded. These phones have been tested well to make sure there's nothing wrong with them. Sure, you might get a recycled camera, but you'll never know. My phone was good as new when I got it, and I am still happy with it to this day.\nThe three-month warranty will cover any problems that a refurbished phone may have - bad battery, touchscreen, etc will be covered in that.\nIf you'd like to keep all your data, you can simply do an iTunes backup (not necessarily to your own computer as it is freezing), then restore that backup to your new phone.\nAlso, your phone is respringing (not rebooting)\n\nA: I bought a macbook from Apple - refurbished : looked absolutely new, perfect, came with 1 year warranty. Been fine. IMHO their refurbished is better than others new.... But your choice.\n", "Q: Preserve spaces order on monitor unplug on MacBook I'm running the latest macOS (10.12.6) and something keeps annoying me a lot with Spaces: if you have an external monitor plugged in and spend some time configuring/customising your spaces placement, when you unplug the monitor, everything is semi-randomized. Semi, because most of the spaces will stay in the same order, but the number of spaces and the location of the spaces will still change.\nHere is what I have when the monitor is plugged in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Monitor\n\n\n*\n\n*space 1: empty\n\n*space 2: app\n\n*space 3: app\n\n*space 4: empty\n\n\n*mac book screen\n\n\n*\n\n*space 5-10: app (1 per space)\n\n*space 11: empty\n\n\n\nWhen I unplug the monitor, it becomes this:\n\n\n*\n\n*space 1: apps that was previously on space 5 and 6\n\n*space 2-3: ok, same apps as before\n\n*space 4-5: empty\n\n*space 6: app that was previously on space 7\n\n*space 7: app that was previously on space 8\n\n*^ repeat up to space 9 / previously space 10\n\n*space 10: empty\n\n*no more space 11\n\n\nThis is mostly annoying because I use keyboard shortcut to move between spaces, so basically I have a mental mapping of shortcut to app, but then it's all mixed up as soon as I unplug the monitor.\nIs there a way to prevent this behaviour?\n\nA: Our questions weren't identical (which is why I went ahead and posted my own question) but I think the answer to mine would help you too: Spaces disappear (but not their application windows) when I unplug external monitors\nIn brief: you can prevent the behavior by unchecking \"Displays have separate Spaces\" in System Preferences -> Mission Control, but you may or may not like the new behavior any better. Spaces won't disappear anymore but you'll cycle through Spaces on all monitors at the same time, and when you plug your monitors back in, you may find that all application windows stay in the right Spaces but lose their placement (i.e. if you carefully arranged the application windows to fit nicely next to each other on your screen, you may find the windows all stacked on top of each other when you plug the monitor back in).\nWhether or not you choose to uncheck \"Displays have separate Spaces,\" you can use a window management app such as Stay or DisplayMaid to save your window configuration and move the windows back to your preferred arrangment after a change.\n", "Q: How do I fix an iPhone 6s plus that has lost apps? My iPhone was not working, so I decided to force reset it (pressing the home button in sync with the power button)\nAfter this most of my apps were gone (including the settings, phone, messages, Facetime, etc). \nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: A normal shutdown is in order. Press the sleep wake and slide to power off. \nIf that doesn’t help and you have an iCloud backup and can erase all content and settings, I would try that. If not, restore when you connect to iTunes and then restore a backup. \nIf you don’t have a backup, you might attempt one via iTunes first and hope you don’t lose all data. \n", "Q: Folder Action for automatic file name cleanup I want to build a folder action that cleans up the filenames of my downloaded files.\nFor example Youtube_MyVideofile_(1080p_30fps_H264-128kbit_AAC).mp4 should be stripped by \"Youtube\" \"30fps\" \"128kbit\" \"AAC\" \"(\" \")\" and \"_\" should be replaced to a \"space\". So the result would be MyVideofile 1080p H264.mp4\nI know I could do this with Automator but then I have to set up a \"search/replace\" element for every word. I'd rather use a single list of words which would be easier to maintain, because I have a lot of different sources where I get files from on regular bases, so the actual list of words to be removed will be very long and may be updated from time to time.\nI found this Automator or AppleScript to Remove Multiple Strings from File Names?\nwhich is similar, but it only worked with selected folders. Instead I want to set it up so it works automatically as a folder action.\nI guess therefore I also need a whitelist of file extensions that the script wont touch, such as \".download\" for safari-downloads that are still in progress.\n\nA: Using Automator, in macOS Sierra 10.12.5, I created a Folder Action with a single Run AppleScript action, using the AppleScript code below, and set it to run on my Downloads folder.

I want to save all of the PNGs from this goofy website so I can turn them into a PDF. I thought I'd use Workflow for iOS, which I've never used before.\nI get the contents of this page and then get all the links\nGet Contents of URL\n|> Get URLs from Input\n|> Quick Look\n\nBut, when I want to filter or match those URLs for PNGs, I get weird applewebdata:// URLs, like\napplewebdata://{guid}/path/to/PNG\n\n\nI am currently using iOS and trying to make Workflow (or something similar) work for this task. Thanks for the other suggestions, but they won't work for me!\n\nA: What a hot mess... I ended up using a number of \"Get Component of URL\" steps to extract the scheme and host from the Workflow Input and the path from the links to PNGs on the page (these were the ones showing as applewebdata://).\nOnce I had the parts of the URL to download, it went something like this\nGet Contents of URL\n|> Get Component of URL; Scheme\n|> Save Variable 'Scheme'\n<Input>\n|> Get Component of URL; Host\n|> Save Variable 'Host'\n<Input>\n|> Get URLs from Input\n|> Repeat with Each\n   |> If Input Contains '.PNG'\n   |> Get Component of URL; Path\n   |> URL <Scheme>://<Host>/<Path>\n   |> Get Contents of URL\n   |> Add to Variable 'Pages'\n|> Pages\n|> Filter Images; Sort by Name A to Z; File Type 'PNG'\n|> Make PDF\n|> Set Name <input.Name>\n|> Quick Look\n|> Save File\n\nIt seems like, if I didn't have to break down into procedural steps to extract and recombine a usable URL, I could have written a much cleaner simpler pipeline. Something like\nGet Contents of URL\n|> Get URLs from Input\n|> Get Contents of URL\n|> Get Images from Input\n|> Filter Images; Sort by Name A to Z\n|> Make PDF\n|> Set Name <input.Name>\n|> Quick Look\n|> Save File\n\n\nA: You're so close! The key missing piece here is using the Get Contents of Web Page action instead of Get Contents of URL. If you simply swap that action in, everything should work as you were expecting it to, and you can use the simpler solution you referenced in your answer.\nHere is a working example:\nGet Contents of Web Page\n|> Get URLs from Input\n|> Get Contents of URL\n|> Filter Images Where: File Extension is 'png', Sort by Name, Order A to Z\n|> Make PDF\n|> Set Name: Workflow Input Name\n|> Quick Look\n|> Save File\n\n\nA: EDIT: If you have a Mac you can use Automator with the following workflow to accomplish this task.\n Try this, it worked for me!

As I understand it, this requires a two-step process.\nFirst, I have to mount the Time Capsule \"Data\" partition:\nmount_afp afp://user:pass@10.0.1.1/Data ~/Data\n\nThen, I have to mount the .sparsebundle on the Data partition that contains the backup files of my Mac. I'm not sure how to do this.\nIt also seems rather awkward that I have to do two mounts to access my backup files. Perhaps I can do it in one step?\nI'd love to hear the best solution for this.\n\nA: If you've configured a regular Time Machine backup onto your Time Capsule, mounting (or unmounting) the sparsebundle is not needed. It's already mounted or you wouldn't be able to backup your data regularly.\nTo mount the remote Time Machine sparsebundle and get the path to it simply enter:\ntmutil latestbackup\n\n(or tmutil latestbackup > /dev/null 2>&1 if you don't want any output)\nThe command triggers the mounting of the sparsebundle and the output is the path to your last backup.\nEntering mount will show you the mount points of the Time Capsule and your sparsebundle.\nYour result will be something like (example listing):\n/dev/disk1s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\nmap -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\n//%user%@%IP% on /Volumes/%TimeCapsule% (afpfs, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk2s2 on /Volumes/%Time Machine-Backups% (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, nobrowse)\n\nThe second last line is the Time Capsule share, the last line (disk2s2) the mounted sparsebundle image. The mounted share/sparsebundle aren't visible in the Finder because they are flagged as nobrowse.\nTo access your backup you can simply enter something like:\ncd \"/Volumes/%Time Machine Backups%/Backups.backupdb/%LocalHostName%/\n\n(All terms framed by percent signs depend on your environment and you have to replace them by proper names/addresses - get them by diving into the folders with cd and ls -la.)\n", "Q: Can you use the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller with an Apple TV?

You will instead need to use a controller that is certified, like the Horipad Ultimate that is sold on the Apple Store. \nYou can find more compatible controllers that are sold on the Apple Store here\n\nA: The upcoming macOS Monterey has support for the Nintendo Pro and Joy-Cons.\nThe Apple engineer could not comment on future plans, so no info on support for the controllers on other platforms (tvOS, iOS and so on).\n", "Q: How to save/export as a MIDI file in GarageBand Opening a midi file (.mid) in GarageBand is the easiest thing ever, but how do I go the other direction? I want to take a piece I recorded as a midi performance in GarageBand and turn it into a midi file. How can this be done? \n\nBackground:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have GarageBand 10.1.6\n\n*I record midi performances all the time in GarageBand and can easily export them as an MP3 \n\n*I want to save/export them as midi files so that I can open them in Synthesia (Synthesia only opens midi files) \n\n\nA: Unfortunately, Garageband doesn't support MIDI export.\nHowever, you could consider buying Apple's Logic Pro X, which is the \"pro version\" of GarageBand. It is quite pricey and might be overkill if you are just dealing with simple MIDI projects but it offers a great deal of features.\nWith Logic you can open your Garageband projects and export your tracks as MIDI files.\n\nA: You can get MIDI from GarageBand using these free application or browser conversion methods \n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks [of GarageBand] is the lack of built-in support for exporting MIDI data. (...) However, a nice guy named Lars Kobbe has put together a workaround/hack that extracts MIDI data from the reluctant clutches of GarageBand. \nYou can download his GB2MIDI Apple droplet script from his site: MIDI-Export in Apples Garageband. Here’s the direct download: GB2MIDI.ZIP\nsource: Scott Troyer: Export MIDI from GarageBand\n\nKobbe also created an experimental JavaScript-based version of the GB2MIDI app which works directly in your browser. This is great because, if the application ever stops working (e.g. after updating your operating system), the browser version still works wonderfully!\nConversion Process\nOnce you have your MIDI performance in GarageBand, you may create a MIDI file (.mid) using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Join the regions of the track you want as a MIDI file (command + J)\n\n*Convert that region to a loop (File > Add Region to Loop Library or drag-and-drop into loops area)\n\n*Find that loop (.aif) file you just created in your hard drive\n\n\n*\n\n*/Users/User'sName/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/User Loops/SingleFiles \n\n\n*Put the loop through the conversion process below\n\n\n*\n\n*Application method: \n\n\n*\n\n*simply drag-and-drop it onto the GB2MIDI converter icon\n\n*Click \"Run\" when the GB2MIDI prompt pops up\n\n*Grab the freshly extracted .mid file (now found in the same folder where the .aif loop was)\n\n\n*Browser method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the browser version of GB2MIDI\n\n*Select \"Choose Files\" (or just drag-n-drop onto \"Choose Files\" button)\n\n*Click \"Convert\"\n\n*Grab the freshly extracted .mid file (now found in the download folder)\n\n\n\n\nNow you can use the MIDI file for whatever you wanted. In my case, I'd open the MIDI file in Synthesia. Thanks to this process, I can make videos like this one.\n", "Q: Copy an app's localized title and text of menu items I'm learning Chinese, and I'd like to switch my system interface to Chinese to increase my familiarity with the language. However, since Chinese characters are not phonetic or alphabetic, it can be hard to even type or draw characters I read into a dictionary to look them up. I'd therefore like to find a way to copy text from the interface, such as app names, menu item names, etc. I know that strings files are found in the Foo.app/Contents/Resources/zh_CN.lproj/*.strings files.

I am using my iPhone 7 Plus for taking work photos and I am finding the timer option unsuitable and using wired earphones isn’t practical. So I’ve been experimenting with Bluetooth headphones to try taking photos with the volume controls, but can’t get this to work.\nI did search via Google but all the results basically say that since the iPhone 5 people can use the volume controls of any wired and bluetooth earphones to take photos with the camera. \nWhat am I doing wrong? I have tried 2 bluetooth headphones and 1 pair of bluetooth earphones and none of them work.\n\nA: You can indeed use Bluetooth headphones for taking photos with the built-in iOS Camera app. In fact, it doesn’t even have to be headphones, so long as the device has volume controls.\nHowever, here’s the catch:- The volume controls of the Bluetooth device have to control the iPhone’s built-in volume (i.e. they control the volume levels of their own speakers via the iPhone's built-in volume control rather than directly changing the volume of the speakers within the earphones/headphones). Unfortunately, many of them do not do this, and that's why any Bluetooth keyboard with volume controls will work as they don't have their own speakers, so can only control the volume at the iPhone end.\nMy recommendation is to use a dedicated remote for this purpose, such as the HISY Bluetooth Camera Remote. This device is designed specifically for this purpose and can be used for both taking photos and videos, and from a distance of up to about 27 metres (90 feet).\nNote: I have no affiliation whatsoever with this product.\n\nA: Since the title of the question is about taking photos remotely, rather than specifically about Bluetooth headphones, I’ll point out that this is also possible using an WATCH.\nThe Camera app that ships with watchOS lets you do a lot more than activate the shutter button remotely. It provides a viewfinder for the iPhone’s camera, so you can check how your final photo will look before taking the shot, and it also lets you switch between different modes, toggle Live Photo and HDR, and set a timer.\n", "Q: How to know whether SSD is permanently implanted on Mac or not?

All the rest are serviceable without solder or needing a new serialized logic board. \nThat being said, Apple and certified repair agents will repair all Mac with storage issues for 5 years from the date of last sale of that model so practically, you’re never without repair options even if you don’t have the skill or tools or training to successfully close a Mac after repair. \nJust about anyone can go to ifixit.com and open up a Mac.

Could not even get Recovery Mode.\nSo right now, I have NO access to Mac. I see it is working, but it seems to have zero connection with monitor. I can't access Recovery Mode, I can't do a thing.\nI have no other monitors to attach there and it is Saturday so local Mac support center is also closed for 2 days.\nAny ideas what this could be caused from?\n\nA: While you're unable to see what's on the screen at present, you'd still be able to use the keyboard to reset the NVRAM and SMC, so I'd try doing that to see if it has any impact.\nReset the NVRAM\nYour Mac mini uses Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) to store various settings. You can reset this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac mini. \n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work. (In your case, since you may not get to see the grey screen, all you need to do is press the keys immediately after powering up)\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again (i.e. a 2nd time) and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nResetting the SMC on a Mac mini\nYour Mac mini's System Management Controller (SMC) can be reset by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac mini\n\n*Unplug it from power\n\n*Wait 15 seconds\n\n*Plug the power cord back in\n\n*Wait for an additional 5 seconds\n\n*Press the power button to turn it back on\n\n\nOnce you've reset the NVRAM and/or SMC, let me know how you go.\n", "Q: Automator action not supplied with the required data I'm trying to do the following in an Automator workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask for Finder items from folder A\n\n*In folder A, add a suffix to the file names\n\n*Copy them to folder B\n\n*In folder B, with an AppleScript, split the file name by a delimiter and then rename the file with the second half of the text split\n\n*In folder B, add a prefix to the file names\n\n*In folder B, add a suffix to the file names\n\n\nHere is a sample of the file names I'm trying to rename:\n\n\n*\n\n*a new file$SG789.jpg\n\n*file_2$123-456.jpg\n\n*file_name$LG123.jpg\n\n*this_file$558-432.jpg\n\n\nThe delimiter I'm splitting by is the \"$\" dollar sign to create the following new files:\n\n\n*\n\n*SG789.jpg\n\n*123-456.jpg\n\n*LG123.jpg\n\n*558-432.jpg\n\n\nThese are the file name formats I'd like for the automator to continue processing. \nThanks to another user, I was able to get this far.

I found a working 80gb hard drive in an old laptop of mine and was wondering if i would be able to replace it without causing any issues (both the same brand).\n\nA: My own experience is with PCs, but most of this advice should be helpful.\nWhen replacing a hard drive, there are a lot of considerations to consider. You didn't say, so I'm assuming your Mac is not a laptop. If so, you need to examine if the placement of connectors is in the same location. Size is incredibly important for laptops, and most do NOT have a lot of room to play around. Check YouTube for how to open and install it properly. Don't go with the first one - check a couple out before you open up your Mac. And pay attention to safety tips.\nYou do say that the hard drives are the same brand. The next thing, though is to check the models. If there is a lot of time between the two HDs, the Mac may or may not be able to communicate with the controller board on the HD. \nMost HD manufacturers list what they are compatible with. Like with Western Digital, the brand, are are several types - Caviars, Raptors, etc. Presumably, though, if the HD from the PC is older, this might not be an issue. \nHard drives have a power connector, a data cable, and there may be jumpers on it to set. If it is close to the same model, set the jumpers to match. Some motherboards require setting slave / master options on the hard drive. \nIf this is your first time opening up a machine, (1) UNPLUG the power cable from computer; and (2) Watch out for static electricity. A handy way to ground yourself is to touch the frame. Remember, AC out of the wall can hurt like the dickens. The power unit converts that to direct current (DC). \n* I will say this to others who read this - working on PCs and Macs are fine, and you proceed at your own risk to your hardware. But only qualified techs should attempt to do anything with monitors; messing with them can be fatal to you. It only takes 1 amp to kill you. *\nRecommend not working on a carpeted area, as you can build static as your feet move around. If you do have to work on a carpet, take off your shoes and socks. Touch the frame often, as it doesn't take much to damage the more fragile components. Most modern PCs and Macs are pretty hardy inside, but there are limits. As I recall, Apple/Macs are pretty easy to disconnect parts. So you are lucky there.\nAnother tip. After disconnecting the power, wait 60 seconds before touching parts or components. Modern computers use high refresh rates instead of steady power flow, and it takes that long for all the power through the system to dissipate. The power to your system will NOT go away if you have it turned off. Since the mid2000's, modern motherboards keep a low charge running through it, for things like remote startups and such. Some computers have NIC lights, and that can be an indicator for you. \nUNPLUG it, and wait 60 seconds before opening up the machine. Touch the frame to dissipate any electric charge you might have built up.\nSo, in summary, see if the manufacturer lists the hard drive as compatible with Macs (it should be; it might just need to be formatted for the Mac to use it first). Check YouTube - enter model of Mac and hard drive. Someone may have done your exact setup, or one close enough to help.\nIf the PC is older than the Mac, again, it SHOULD be able to talk, but I recommend checking the mfg list to make sure. No sense taking it out if it's not. Lastly, pay attention to connectors and jumpers. \nI like a good, multi-head screwdriver. NON-magnetic! Magnetic screwdrivers are handy around cars. They are probable death to computer innards. Jeweler screwdrivers can get the real tiny screws...\nAnyway, hope this helps. Good luck! And be safe!\n\nA: If your Mac laptop was made after 2006, it should be able to accept the $115 HDD you linked from Amazon.  The 80 GB HDD you have is worth around $25. https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-80Gb-Inch-Drive-Laptop/dp/B0069P3CCI.\nBefore 2006 the Mac laptop internal connector was called IDE/ATA, now it's called SATA.\nYou will need a bootable USB with the osX installer or a bootable installer DVD (can be a burned DVD-R.) When you boot this you will erase the windows information on the 80 GB drive and install osX.\nIf you use the dvd hold c when you reboot - it used to mean boot from cd.\nDetailed instructions are at - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4697858?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: How can I tell mac to stop trying to connect \"idisk\" server? 10.10.5 and 10.11.6 on same network, Imac and macbook pro. I get a re-ocurring popup that says,  \"cannot connect to idisk\" popup notification. It keeps returning even though I select \"cancel\". It holds my system hostage, not allowing other apps to work until I (again, and again) try to click it away by pressing cancel. It goes away for a while, but eventually returns.\n\nA: My own experience is with PCs, but I'll give this a shot.\nFrom what I've been able to discern, iDrive is an online backup program. You don't say, but I'm assuming you have an iDrive account, and it keeps trying to connect. I've seen similar behavior with GoogleSync, when it checks files and brings my own system to a standstill until it's finished. \nI checked, and Macs have an equivalent to Task Manager, the Force Quit Applications Manager. Command+ Option+ Escape will bring this dialog up. Search for the iDrive application in the list of apps. There should be an option to click on the list of apps (process name), and it should sort -- I'm basing this on PC experience. Scroll through the list for the iDisk app. Click on it to select, and the QUIT button is on the upper left corner. This should terminate the application. This should free up your machine to do other things.\nOnce you are done, however, this is a temporary solution. The next time you boot up, you will have the same problem. You need to address WHY the app is having problems. I have not used iDrive, but assume it's subscription. Is your account active? If not, you should uninstall the app. If you are a current and active subscriber, you might then need to call the company to find out why you aren't able to log in. I am assuming it worked before without issues and without bringing your system to a standstill. Assuming you are subscribed and want to keep the app, there may be an option to repair the application; not all software has that option, but the better ones do. Otherwise, barring a call to the company, you might need to uninstall and re-install. Macs are pretty stable machines, but sometimes an application does get corrupted.\nThe steps above should help you get control of your Mac. Again, then you need to deal with the iDrive program and why it's misbehaving. Good luck!\n", "Q: Can photo sync be as effortless as music sync, between macOS and iOS? To copy photos from iOS (and make space for more photos) one connects the device (iPhone or iPad) with a cable to the Mac and opens Photos, then imports.\nBut with music things \"just work\" without the user having to do anything. I have \"smartlists\" set up. When the music (even just play count) changes on my Mac, they sync wirelessly and with no intervention on my part, not even triggering the sync.\nDoes such a convenience exist for photos? Is there a way to say \"iOS: everytime you're on the same WiFi as my Mac, copy the photos over to the Mac, and delete the photos\"?\nBasically I'm looking for functionality similar to Dropbox/iCloud, but without any cloud or cloud-like features. It seems like a pretty obvious feature to add, especially in a homogeneous ecosystem, and so the question is: are we there yet?\n\nA: Yes - enable iCloud Photo Library. I’ve been happy with this for my main personal library consisting of 90 GB library size and 75,000 photos.\nI do maintain some side libraries that don’t sync to iCloud - but those are specific professional and trip specific libraries where I just save my best 100 or so photos from those libraries to my “main” library.\nI have a MacPro that keeps original size of all photos. The rest of the iPad, iPhone, Apple TV and Mac that sync are allowed to “optimize” photo sizes when the main storage for that device runs low.\nI’m happy knowing I can use Time Machine (or SuperDuper / Arq / CrashPlan / whatever) to make offline and off-site backups of my Main libraries and not trust that iCloud Photo Library will never mess things up. So far it hasn’t, but I have a plan to walk away from iCloud any time and restore from backup if needed.\n—– \nEven better - Apple offers caching service so you could cache all your iCloud data locally on pretty much and Mac you can leave running with an inexpensive external drive if needed. I like to give 500 GB of space to cache downloads and iCloud data and that works well for 5 people, each with several devices and similar sized photo and music libraries. The caching server makes backup and restore very fast as well as updates and upgrades to new OS and new devices when they get configured the first time.\nOn 10.12 and lower - this caching service is part of Server.app and works great.\nOn 10.13 and higher - there are signs you won’t need server.app to cache apps and iCloud data locally. I have no complaints yet testing this in beta.\n", "Q: How do I remove Gmail from my Mail app without removing Gmail account from system preferences? I got myself a MacBook today, and one of the steps I took to set it up was adding my work email account (Microsoft Exchange) to the Mail app.\nI also had to give other apps access to my personal Google account, but because of that my linked Gmail account was added to the Mail app as well. Now, I get notifications from new messages in my personal mailbox every few minutes, which I don't want.\nWhen I checked online on how to remove my personal account from the Mail app, all articles pointed to removing the Google account from System Preferences. However, doing that would remove my Google permissions for the other apps as well, which I don't want.\nHow do I resolve this matter?\n\nA: Although the answer above is valid - there is a nicer (I think) way. \nYou don't need to delete your Google account, and you don't need to disable it specifically in Apple-Mail application. \nIf you open your System Preferences, and select the Internet Accounts panel, you'll see your accounts on the left, Google being one of them. \nIf you select your Google account on the left, you can then choose which services this account will connect to. You can uncheck \"Mail\" while retaining other Google Services.\nHere is my system preferences screenshot \n\nA: Simply disable your Gmail account by going into the menu bar, Mail → Preferences → Accounts and uncheck Enable this account under Account Information for your Gmail account.\nThe account will remain under System Preferences, but Mail will no longer fetch your email nor, therefore, notify you of incoming email under your Gmail account.\n\n", "Q: iCloud sent mail (from Gmail web interface) not listed I trying to use the Gmail send mail as feature in which I use the iCloud mail credentials and smtp.mail.me.com.\nIt works, I was able to send mail from Gmail web interface while the sender was my iCloud account.\nBut when looking for that mail in the iCloud Sent folder it is not there. So it seems there is no log in the apple side of emails sent using Gmail send as feature. Or I'm missing something?\n\nA: SMTP servers don’t always save a copy of outgoing messages in a Sent folder. Gmail’s SMTP server does, but iCloud’s leaves that behavior up to the mail client (in this case, Gmail's Send As feature).\nWhen using an external SMTP server, it appears that Gmail does not instruct that SMTP server (in this case, iCloud) to store a copy of outgoing messages in its Sent folder; that is why you don’t see the record you’re looking for in iCloud.\n", "Q: How do I make my Apple ID sign in request silent? Every time I sign in iCloud I receive in iPad a notification to allow login. Thats ok!\nWhat's not okay is that sound so loud. How do I make it elegantly silent?\n\nA: The two-factor authentication alert follows the volume of Ringer and Alerts. It can be adjusted via the hardware volume buttons, although you may have disabled that functionality.\nIf that is the case, head into Settings → Sounds and adjust the slider for Ringer and Alerts. This will affect the volume of all notifications (including FaceTime call notifications).\nIf you want to completely silence those alerts, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag the slider all the way down.\n\n*Use your iPad’s hardware mute switch (removed starting with iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, iPad Pro and iPad 5).\n\n*Pull up the Control Center and enable the crossed-out bell icon.\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to recover all stored text message data on old iPhone (A1241) to external drive? I managed to import all the photos off an old iPhone 3G I recently rediscovered while going through my junk drawer. I used Image Capture, but now I’d like to get all the texts.\nI'd like to use only the terminal, ie. no downloads of third-party software, and I'd like to NOT use iTunes or iCloud. My Mac is running Sierra. Would like to get the notes off too if possible. Is this doable?\n\nA: For anyone not bound by the strict “no third party” requirement - go get a copy of Phone View. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/\nIt does everything asked for and you can use it on all devices for one license. The free trial let’s you install and be sure it will work before paying for the software. \nIf I discover a way to get started or accomplish this using only Apple terminal and free Mac App Store apps, I’ll edit that in here as well. I would start with Apple Configurator and the command line tools it installs since that can read log files and get past the “trust” steps that iTunes and iCloud typically perform when getting data from iOS to macOS. \n", "Q: 3 TB Fusion Drive missing space after unsuccessful Windows installation via Bootcamp I have been trying to install Windows via Bootcamp on my iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017, 3 TB Fusion Drive; Mac OS 10.12.6) and messed up.

Stopping the Windows install and trying to revert to a previous state inflated the size of the Recovery HD at the expense of your main macOS volume \"Macintosh HD\". The normal size of the Recovery HD partition is 650.0 MB with ~526 MB occupied by a base macOS system and ~124 MB of free space.\n\nNow you can either remove the oversized recovery partition (alluding to this answer: How do I regain unaccessible free space after a failed Boot Camp install on a non-Fusion drive?), expand the Logical Volume disk2 and reinstall macOS to recreate the recovery partition or you can resize your current recovery partition to a smaller but non-standard size and expand the Logical Volume disk2.  \nThe first option takes at least 90 minutes, the second probably less than two minutes. \nThe second option works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to your main macOS volume\n\n*Get the partition list with diskutil list and here the device identifier of the recovery partition\n\n*Resize the oversized 1.5 TB recovery partition:\ndiskutil resizeVolume diskXs3 1024m #with X either 0 or 1\n\nIf you get a \"too small\" error choose a slightly larger size like 1088m until you are successful.\n\n*Get the UUID of the Logical Volume with diskutil cs list\n\n*Resize the CoreStorage stack with:\ndiskutil cs resizeStack lvUUID size\n\nIn your case that's:\ndiskutil cs resizeStack ED2463F3-F297-4C53-88C7-6701DBF8E63E 3105817m\n\nIf you get a \"too large\" error choose a slightly smaller size like 3105812m until you are successful. The larger your Recovery HD has to be in the first resize step, the smaller the size has to be here.\n", "Q: How to hide the top menu of chrome? How to hide the top menu of chrome?  File/Edit/View/...\n\n\nA: This is a way to hide the whole menu bar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Click General\n\n*Under the Appearance section, check \"Automatically hide & show the menu bar\".\n\n*Close System Preferences; the menu bar on your computer should now automatically show when you mouse over it, and hide when you move your mouse cursor somewhere else.\n\n\nPS. This applies to all applications, not just Chrome.\n", "Q: Configuring XAMPP on macOS Sierra (version 10.12.6) On a fresh installation of macOS, I decided to use XAMPP (I have previously used MAMP (free ver.)) but I have encountered some simple issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*The general tab shows IP address 192.168.64.2 but my system IP is 192.168.1.100. Why is the IP different by default? And how can this be changed to use the same? The \"go to application page\" loads dashboard on 192.168.64.2 but I'd like to use the localhost on some port like localhost:8888 / 127.0.0.1:8888.\n\n*Trying to open phpmyadmin returned an access forbidden page (\"... New XAMPP security concept: ...\"). I looked up about it in google which showed results suggesting to edit the configuration file to allow external access. I'd like to keep it to localhost, so I guess the IP has to be changed to localhost. How can that be achieved?\n\n*Unlike MAMP, there is no option to set the port within the application, so I tried to look for the httpd file in `Applications->XAMPP->(show package contents)->contents->... but did not find the file. So where are the configuration files?\n\nP.S. Do not suggest to turn off the system provided apache server\n  (sudo apachectl stop)\n\n\nA: I think the problem is that you installed the XAMPP VM version that executes a virtual machine on macOS. Check on the XAMPP website and download the normal version.\nHope this is the case and that this info helps.\n", "Q: edit a .jpg file in preview I have typed the name of a bird on a .jpg photo. I made a spelling mistake and tried to edit it. I can create a new text box but not edit the original. Is there a way to edit a text box once you have saved the file\n\nA: No, there is no way to edit the text after saving the image.\nYou may be able to revert to a previous version of the image, before the misspelt text was written:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the image in Preview.app\n\n*Select the menu item: File > Revert To > Browse All Versions\n", "Q: How to download macOS Sierra again from the App Store? I need to download the macOS Sierra installer again (latest version, 10.12.6) as my latest installer seems to be corrupted. But going into the Purchased tab in the App Store does not show Download (obviously), but Open.\nEven if I move out the current installer, I never get the Download button ... how can I proceed?\n\nA: You will need to delete the current installer. OS X applications are usually very good about keeping track of files, even when they get moved (see How does Mac OS keep track of moved files?). In this case, the AppStore is likely keeping track of the application bundle (which you would normally want it to do) when you move it.\n", "Q: iCloud issues on my new iPhone So I recently lost an iPhone 6s Plus, and ordered a new iPhone 7 plus through the insurance, once the 7 arrived, I restored it via iTunes from a previous backup, now here's the issue.
