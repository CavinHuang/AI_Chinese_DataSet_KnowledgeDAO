Here the server specifices one or more triples of protocol (usually TCP or UDP), port number(like http or smtp) and ip address (ipv4 or ipv6).\nAll those are specified in the configuration files.\nAs long as no such triple are the same, you will have no collisio.  Except for the special address 0.0.0.0 or 0::0. These are only allowed when used as listening address, never destination address. \nThey mean that the kernel (operating system) should listen on all configuted ipv4 or ipv6 addresses on the computer.  So, if you have started to listen to that address and then tries to listen to another address with same protocol and port number will conflict with previous opend ports. \nSo you have to find this and adjust configuration accordingly what you actually wants.\n\nA: xxx.xxx.xxx.xx4:25565 Based on what you said I am sure that you haven't used this xxx.xxx.xxx.xx4 specific IP in the server start process or server configuration.

You can find all its existing files & directories (without listing the files in all the named directories) with locate -b -e 4.4.6-my-kernel. Appending rm -r to this with xargs allows you to delete the files too. I add -p to make xargs display targets and ask for confirmation before executing\nlocate -b -e 4.4.6-my-kernel | xargs -p sudo rm -r\n\nthen type y to execute rm -r on the targets shown.

So I began with the resources for terminal commands like pdf and webpages.\nAren't those terminal commands stored somewhere in the file syster?\nIn that case where are they stored and how can I see the terminal commands? \nPS: It will be like a single command which lists and displays all the rest of command that are stored in the system.\n\nA: You can also use man -k <keyword> to search for any command based on the particular keyword. apropos mentioned in other answer actually uses the database generated by mandb. So, both of the following will produce same output:\nman -k disk\napropos disk\n\nBoth of the above provides regular expressions based pattern search by default.\nSee the manpages of man and apropos for details.\n\nA: You could try using the apropos command to find a command knowing a basic idea of the command.

I'm very comfortable while using Linux or Lubuntu although Windows seemed a little faster but it hangs at a certain point.

People use computers for different purposes and no software can know what you want. It is like \"I want a phone which makes phone-calls automatically to necessary people\".\nOne of the best advantages of Linux systems is that you can manage and customize your system to more extent than other OS. That is the thing which makes Linux more powerful. \nTime passes and you may become more and more proficient.

For example, today there may be a couple hours where g's show up as some random symbol in all of my Firefox windows. Tomorrow it might be a's and k's doing the same thing in all terminal windows, etc.\nWhen it occurs in the web browser, zooming in or out typically resolves the problem and makes the characters render correctly. However zooming isn't possible in the terminal, settings dialogs, etc, so it's not a real solution.\nI've uploaded some screenshots that demonstrate the behavior in this imgur album: http://imgur.com/a/2wNVu\nThe first two screenshots are from a Firefox window with plain HTML. Notice how zooming in (2nd photo) makes the problem obvious, but zooming out seems to resolve it.\nThe one scenario in which I haven't experienced the problem ever is with PDFs - they always render clearly no matter the zoom.\nSome system information:\nThe graphics card is the standard \"Dell\" Radeon 240.

Where do you install your own application?\nCould anyone help me?\n\nA: A package to be uploaded to the Debian repositories should avoid /opt and /usr/local - these directories are reserved for the local system administrator, as per the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

Hence your script essentially tries to run\nmv ./2.pdb.ostat.pdb.ostat ./2.pdb.ostat.ostat\n\nInstead, you have to truncate the filename back to just the number first. e.g.\nfor filename in ./*; do num=\"$(echo \"${filename}\" | grep -o '^./[0-9]*')\"; echo \"${num}.pdb.ostat\" \"${num}.ostat\"; done\n\nOnce you have confirmed the syntax is okay, you can change the echo to a mv, and actually move the files. i.e.\nfor filename in ./*; do num=\"$(echo \"${filename}\" | grep -o '^./[0-9]*')\"; mv \"${num}.pdb.ostat\" \"${num}.ostat\"; done\n\n\nNevertheless, the easiest way is to use (perl) rename.\nrename 's/pdb.//' *.pdb.ostat –\n\nSee man rename for more info.\n\nA: Here's a bash script that accomplishes what you want in a less specific way.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#renext.sh\n# a bash script for changing the extension of files.\necho \"what extension would you like to change in this directory?\"\nread oldext\necho \"To what?\"\nread newext\nfor f in *.* \ndo\n    name=$(echo \"$f\" | sed 's/\\.[^\\.]*$//')\n    ext=$(echo \"$f\" | sed 's/^.*\\.//')\n    target=\"$name\".\"$newext\"\n    echo \"source file\" \"$f\" is made up of the base \"$name\" and ends with \"$ext\"\n    if [ -e \"$target\" ];\n    then \n        echo \"$target\" exists. skipping renameing.\n    else\n        mv \"$f\" \"$target\"\n        echo changed \"$f\" to \"$target\"\n    fi  \n\n done\n\nThis script does not break on filenames with spaces and allows you to choose the source and target extensions.\nIt provides examples of a for loop, reading input into variables, using sed to pick a string apart at the last .  in the string (filename), how spaces can be handled properly by quoting variables, checking for the existence of a target file and flow control based on the result of a test.

I don't want to lose them.\nand after i successfully install ubuntu, how im gonna install these drivers ?\nintel HD graphics / realtek HD audio manager / etc etc \nhttp://www.mediafire.com/view/8xa3a0bkxoxia4s/Untitled3.png\nNOTE: there was a drivers cd with my motherboard box, will it run on linux ?\nIn short, I'm just worried about the other partitions.\n\nA: \nI got 3 partitions, two are 390gb each ntfs & one is 149 gb ntfs where Windows is installed, now i want to install Ubuntu on 149gb partition but I don't want to even touch the other twos,\n\nThis is certainly possible, and it's a reasonable short-term course of action; however:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's always the risk of accidentally damaging or destroying one or both of those partitions, because of user error, a bug, a hardware failure, etc. Back up important user data before proceeding!!\n\n*In the long term, using NTFS on a Linux-only system is unwise. Linux lacks NTFS repair tools, so the moment you do an unclean shutdown or the filesystem develops a fault, you won't be able to fix it except by booting a Windows emergency disk. Furthermore, the way Ubuntu provides read/write access to NTFS is through a driver that's slow, compared to the standard Linux filesystem drivers.\n\n\nThus, I recommend you develop a plan to migrate entirely to ext4fs (or some other Linux filesystem, such as XFS or Btrfs). You have plenty of space in which to do this, so the only question is how. Generally, Linux users store all their data in their home directories under /home, so one possibility would be to create a ~30GiB root (/) partition, a ~5GiB swap partition (see below), and a /home partition in the space occupied by your Windows C: partition, then copy the data over from D: to /home, delete D:, expand /home, and repeat for E:. This might be a tight fit, so you might need to temporarily move some stuff from D: to E:, but this is probably the way to go. (In fact, you might want to move stuff from D: to E: in Windows before you wipe it. That will give you the option of deleting D: from the start, and moving those files in Windows will be slightly safer than moving them in Ubuntu, should that be necessary.) You could modify this plan in various ways if you wanted.\n\nnow if I format my 149gb partition, I will use ext4 and i will use \" / \" as a mount point and will select primary, but there is another option \"Location for new partition\"\nQuestion: which option should I select ? beginning or end ? and explain them please :\n\nThe beginning/end question is relevant only if you create a partition that's smaller than the available free space; it tells the partitioner whether to put that new partition at the beginning or end of the free space, leaving the remaining free space after or before, respectively, the new partition.\nNote that for the migration plan I've proposed, it's important that the /home partition fall at the end of the initial Ubuntu space, so that it can be easily expanded into the space used by your current D: and E: partitions.\n\nAfter it, I will create another partition for swap, how much should I give it ?\n\nTraditionally, swap space has been about twice your RAM. These days it's rare to need that much swap space. The most common use for lots of swap space is if you use a computer's suspend-to-disk feature, in which case you need at least as much swap space as you have RAM. That's why I suggested ~5GiB of swap space; with 4GiB of RAM, that gives you a little margin for error when specifying the size and you'll still be able to suspend to disk. If you don't plan to ever suspend to disk, you can get by with even less swap space. Some people don't use any at all, although I don't recommend going to that extreme because the kernel can use swap space to optimize performance if your RAM needs rise and then fall back down.\n\nand after i successfully install ubuntu, how im gonna install these drivers ?\nintel HD graphics / realtek HD audio manager / etc etc\n\nYou don't normally need to worry about that; the Linux kernel and related tools (such as Xorg) include drivers. You only need to install extra drivers if you've got bleeding-edge hardware or if you want advanced features available in manufacturer-provided drivers for some hardware, such as ATI/AMD or Nvidia video cards.\n\nNOTE: there was a drivers cd with my motherboard box, will it run on linux ?\n\nIt might include Linux drivers; but if so, they're probably just older versions of drivers that come with Ubuntu already, so you might as well put that drivers CD in the circular file.\n", "Q: using cut in a loop script I am using bash on my macbook pro.

For\n           backward compatibility, yes is equivalent to rwh and no is\n           equivalent to frwh. If not specified, only the superuser can make\n           any changes. The most restrictive setting is better achieved by not\n           installing chfn SUID.\n\n", "Q: How to access BIOS settings with EFI? I have a new PC, based on a Gigabyte H81m motherboard. With no hdd, I can access BIOS settings by pressing DEL at startup.\nWhen I install Windows 8.1 with EFI boot, to access BIOS settings I have to press shift while rebooting. At that point I have an option \"change manufacturer settings\" or something like that.\nNow, that on my PC there's only Ubuntu 14.10, there's no way to access the BIOS or choose another startup disk. DEL keys or F2 keys are ignored.\nI see AMI for a split second saying \"booting in unsecure mode\", then the Ubuntu logo\nIt looks like the bootmanager should \"boot to the BIOS settings\" or something like that, but... HOW?\n(Note: this is not a duplicate of other questions like this: Unable to access BIOS - I know which is the key to access it, the problem is that with EFI boot, it's ignored.\n\nA: You wrote:\n\nIt looks like the bootmanager should \"boot to the BIOS settings\" or something like that, but... HOW?\n\nIf you're saying that GRUB has a menu entry with that label, try using it. Many EFI boot managers (I think including GRUB) now offer such an option. The option doesn't work on all EFIs, though, so it's conceivable that GRUB has such an option but it doesn't work on your computer.\nThere's an option in Windows to reboot into the setup utility. This Acer page describes how to access it, but I'm not sure offhand if the instructions are specific to Acer's configuration or if they apply universally. I know I've seen a \"generic\" description somewhere, but I don't happen to have the URL bookmarked.\nAnother option is to use my rEFInd boot manager. It definitely offers an option to reboot into the firmware setup utility, although if rEFInd thinks the firmware doesn't support it, the option won't appear in the menu. (The option appears as an icon of a computer chip on the second row of icons.) You can try rEFInd temporarily by creating a CD-R or USB flash drive; ready-made images for these are available on the rEFInd downloads page. That could be a chicken-and-egg scenario, though, since you'll probably need to get to the computer's built-in boot manager to boot from a CD-R or USB drive. Thus, you may need to go all-in and install rEFInd to your hard disk to try it. (If you don't like it, you can always use efibootmgr to disable rEFInd. Type efibootmgr to see the current boot options, then change the boot order with efibootmgr -o, as in efibootmgr -o 2,0,7 to boot options 2, 0, and 7, in that order of preference.)\nOnce you're into the setup utility, look for options called fast boot, USB support, or variants of those terms. It's conceivable that installing Windows somehow changed the firmware defaults to speed up the boot process, and in doing so disabled the key to access the firmware at boot time. Adjusting these options back to their defaults should re-enable the feature you want, at the cost of a second or two of extra boot time.\n", "Q: how to type special characters in wijesekara layout ? I have used wijesekara layout with windows xp. at there i could use alt+num to type the keys that are not in the keyboard. but now in ubuntu wijesekara layout it seems that this doesn't work. how can i type speciall characters those have to be written in normally by pressing alt and entering a number? \n\nA: By using the numeric code point feature.

The addresses are usually assigned\n  with the DHCP protocol. Since the modems are usually powered-on for\n  extended periods of time, the address leases are usually set to long\n  periods and simply renewed upon expiration. If a modem is turned off\n  and powered up again before the next expiration of the address lease,\n  it will most likely receive the same IP address.DSLReports\n\n", "Q: My Ubuntu 14.04 Wifi not working Toshiba L650 tried everything ########## wireless info START ##########\n\nReport from: 09 Mar 2015 18:16 IST +0530\n\nBooted last: 09 Mar 2015 18:07 IST +0530\n\nScript from: 20 Sep 2014 23:04 UTC +0000\n\n##### release ###########################\n\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\n##### kernel ############################\n\nLinux 3.13.0-45-generic #74-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jan 13 19:36:28 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nParameters: ro, quiet, splash, vt.handoff=7\n\n##### desktop ###########################\n\nUbuntu\n\n##### lspci #############################\n\n02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter [14e4:4727] (rev 01)\n    Subsystem: Askey Computer Corp.

On the other hand, going to Apache Maven site, I can download a 7 MB file. What could be the reason behind this?  \n\n\nA: You are conflating three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*the size of Maven itself\n\n*the size of Maven + all its dependencies, like Java\n\n*the size of the compressed packages (vs its actual size).\n\n\nThe size of the Maven package is only about 1.3 MB because of compression (see apt-cache show maven | grep -i size). The total size of the packages you are installing is 139 MB (compressed, which is what you'll download) - 229 MB after unpacking. This includes the OpenJDK 6 JDK.\nSince you have already installed Oracle JDK, it might be best for you to manually install Maven, instead of using apt, since you'll have to download the OpenJDK version as well if you use apt.\nIf you want to be fair, add the size of the Oracle JDK (around 135 MB) to that 7 MB, which should tell you it's around the same size as well.\n", "Q: Time rest issue after machine reboot I set a particular time in my VM machine which is containing Ubuntu 12.04 using some command. Time got changed soon after the command got executed, but if I reboot machine time is resetting back(which used to be before running command).\n\nA: Well - your issue isn't really that much descriptive, but anyway for proper time handling I'd recommend, first of all, two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*proper time zone settings\n\n*using ntp to make sure local time doesn't go off - hardware clock (also the time presented by supervisor to guest systems with it) can drift over time.\n\n\nAnyway - if that doesn't help yet with your issue, can you, please, present us examples of what was the time before and after - what and how much actually changed?\nthanks\n", "Q: Is ubuntu supports on Lenovo g5070 and how to install...? Is ubuntu supports on Lenovo g5070 and how to install...\n\nA: Yes, I quickly googled the specs of it and it's much more than enough to install ubuntu. And it seems, it comes with preinstalled dos. If yours have it too, then you can either install ubuntu along with it or you can remove the dos os giving everything to ubuntu. \nIn either case, you would require a live cd of ubuntu. What you need to do is first download the version of ubuntu you want to install ( I would recommend 14.04 ) and get a usb drive (2 gb would be fine). Use start up disk creater ( if you have access to linux based os on some other computer) or universal usb installer (in case of windows) to make installation disk of ubuntu.\nBoot from the usb and simply follow the instructions. This link might be useful.\n", "Q: how to delete a primary group Myself is Divya.. i am new to Linux/Unix.. i have a question on user and group management..\nI read that for deleting a group a group must be empty..\nI want to delete a primary group without deleting the users(as they belongs to other groups which is their secondary group)\nfor example I want to delete a group called ABC which contains the users U1,U2,U3,U4 whereas U1 and U4 belongs to another secondary group called DEF and GHI respectively.\nABC is the primary group for U1 and U4. let me know he command/s..\nThanks\n\nA: If the group is a primary group for them - you'll have to change the primary group for those users. \nIf no particular primary group is needed for them you can assign each of them their own group - the same as their username. Up to you.\nOf course you may have to create those groups (or another group for them)\nAnyway - to change group (primary or secondary) you can use usermod command.\nYou can also edit password/group files as necessary, if you want.\nTo create new group you will use groupadd.\n", "Q: Turn partition-less disk into partitioned I have formatted the disk (/dev/sdb) instead of partiton(/dev/sdb1) and filled it with data. I have a remote backup of data, but no way to do a local backup, as it is 3Tb. Now my dual-boot Windows attempts to corrupt the disk every time I run it.\nIs there any way I can attempt to turn this partitionless disk into GPT-partitioned one without reformatting it and redownloading 3Tb of data? \n\nA: In theory, I suppose you could shrink the filesystem on the disk by a small amount (say, 2 MiB), then use tricky dd commands to shift it all 1 MiB to the right, then use gdisk or parted to create a partition table with a partition that begins at 1 MiB.\nIn practice, I do NOT recommend attempting this because there's too much chance of a slipup that will trash everything. It might be OK to risk it if you had a backup, but you say you don't have a backup. Thus, my recommendation is:\nBUY ADEQUATE BACKUP HARDWARE! Once that's bought, back up the disk, partition it, and restore. In fact, you could simplify things by buying a similar-sized disk as your backup hardware, partition it normally, copy the files, and begin using the new disk in place of the original and the original as your backup.\n", "Q: Terminal window New to Ubuntu 14.04.

You will see Terminal show up under application.\n", "Q: Stuck at splash screen of ubuntu when changing from Lightdm to GDM After changing the display manager from lightdm to GDM, when I boot Ubuntu it gets stuck at the splash screen.\nWhat could be the reason and how can I fix this?\n\nA: If you can get into tty1 with CtrlAltF1, log in and do\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm. You will be prompted to choose default desktop manager. Select lightdm. Reboot with sudo shutdown -r now\nIf you are keen on changing the desktop manager, there are lightdm-gtk-greeter and lightdm-webkit-greeter , which are pretty much ok,too.

What's the best practice for eliminating keys you don't want?\nSo I figured out that I have an extra set of keys. What I want to know is if I should expire the ones I don't want or revoke them or something else? I've used them to sign emails but I don't think I've ever encrypted anything with them. I've already set an expiry date of tomorrow but should I bother keeping them or just revoke and then delete? I've already securely copied the correct keys from another machine. The expired keys were uploaded to the key server but IDK if that means the old ones were overwritten or if now there are two sets of keys up on the key server, one with an expiry set and one without?\n\nA: If the keys are stored on key servers, deleting is not an option. It is not possible to delete anything from the key server network.\nSo, you are to consider between expiration and revocation. Expiration has the meaning of limiting the validity to a given date, while revocation is a statement \"I won't use this key any more\", with the possibility of giving a reason (superseded, compromised, ...). I would say, revoking a key with message \"superseded\" is a clearer statement than setting an expiration date.\nFor primary keys expiration is not an option anyway: an attacker getting hold of the private key (eg., because it is easier to crack it in future) could simply change the expiration date, and use the key again. This is not possible, if you shared a revocation certificate. Also see Does GPG key expiration add to security?, but be aware one of the answers given is simply wrong.\n", "Q: How can I get the MAC addresses of machines using python-nmap?

You're laptop uses integrated Intel graphics, which are well-supported in Linux, so it shouldn't be having issues with the resolution.\nAre you dual-booting with Windows 8 or just using Ubuntu?\nIf you just want Ubuntu installed, then the remedy is simple - erase the hard disk and install Ubuntu again. If you're dual-booting, then things are little more complicated.\nOnce we establish this, then we can proceed further.\n\nA: OK. Without knowing the details, I'd suggest that you try the procedure in these answers in the first instance. The first one shows you how to back up your files before reinstalling Ubuntu. (The answers are written for 12.04, but the procedure in 14.04 is essentially the same.)\nIf there's no option to automatically reinstall Ubuntu alongside Windows 8, you might need to select \"Something else\" in the installer. If you're not familiar with hard disk partitioning, it might be a good idea to take a look at step 6 of this tutorial.

In your case there is none, because\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 is at the beginning of the drive and\n\n*there's another partition sda2 right behind it.\n\n\nSince sda2 is an empty extended partition, I recommend that you delete it, then resize sda1.\n\nA: That's because you have /dev/sda2 \"in the middle\", and since the scheme you see in gparted is a physical representation of the partitions on the disk, extending /dev/sda1 would actually mean overwhelming /dev/sda2's space, which of course is not allowed. So you need to first remove /dev/sda2 in order to extend /dev/sda1\n\nA: There is 510MB of sda2 extended partition in between. You have to get rid of that, only then you can resize sda1.\nAs far as I know there is  only one way to achieve this.

You have to manually enable them post-upgrade. \nThe packages are upgraded if a newer version exists, or left alone if there's no corresponding package in the official repositories. \nYou can visit the PPA page and check if it supports the newer release. In the Overview of published packages section, the Published in dropdown menu lists the  releases for which packages are available.\n\nA: Trusty and Utopic have this problem.  Most PPAs have support for both.

Their Java PPA is great, because due the Oracle EULA, Oracle Java cannot be redistributed, but the PPA runs a JDK installer (similar to the flash-installer approach).\nThis PPA is oftenly updated and has even Java 9. So, you can always keep your Java automatically updated and properly configured.\nTo add the PPA and install Java8 from there:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\n\nA: Your installation is all right but you need the alternatives system to set the default binary to be executed when you just type jave or javac. Basically the alternatives system lets you to select a binary to run when there are many other alternative binaries having the same functionality.\nIn your case you have two versions of java installed with alternatives having only the old version linked as generic java binary. You need to add the new version in the java binary alternatives and also set it as default by prioritizing it over others by using a numerical value.\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_40/bin/java 100\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_40/bin/javac 100\n\nThis command will do the job, we have linked the new binaries to the java and javac alternatives, also set those as default by giving them higher priority (100) over the older versions (2 - checked by update-alternatives --display java & update-alternatives --display javac, you can also use update-alternatives --query java).\n", "Q: OpenSSH defaults (sshd_config) on root server So while trying to set up an sftp user I apparently broke the sshd_config.\nSince the moment I changed it I can't connect via SSH and FTP anymore: Connection refused.\nMy server hoster provides a function to boot into a recovery mode which starts into a zsh shell.\nBut me failing at doing a backup of the original config and not having enough knowledge to rewrite it myself, I got stuck here.

Some files may be manufacturer specific and cannot be restored by reinstalling Windows.\n\n*\n\n*In a working UEFI Ubuntu installation it is mounted as /boot/efi/ and at least contains a folder named EFI.

( /media/my_efi_system_partition/EFI = \\EFI\\ )\n\n\n*Copy or rename which ever EFI loader you want to use to \\EFI\\BOOT\\loader.efi. Some loaders like gummiboot need to be configured properly.\n\n*Copy PreLoader.efi to \\EFI\\BOOT\\bootx64.efi and HashTool.efi to the same directory.\n\n\nYou can find more detailed explanations over at Rod Smith's site.\nUsing HashTool\nIf you followed the instructions carefully and have Secure Boot enabled, you should be greeted by the following screens upon next boot, which guide you through

I can't seem to increase the nofile limit for non-root users on Ubuntu 14.04, despite following every StackExchange answer related to this problem. So far I have:\n$ cat /etc/security/limits.d/custom.conf\n@www-data hard nofile 50000\n@www-data soft nofile 50000\n# even tried specifying the username directly:\nmyuser hard nofile 50000\nmyuser soft nofile 50000\n\n$ grep 'limits' /etc/pam.d/common-session*\n/etc/pam.d/common-session:session required        pam_limits.so\n/etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive:session required        pam_limits.so\n\n$ cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max\n101232\n\nRebooted, logged in, and:\n$ ulimit -n 4097\n-bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n\nThere still somehow seems to be a limit of 4096 max for non-root users. \n\nA: This article, I think addresses your issue.\nBasically you should use ulimit command to increase the available resources.\nFor example:\nUse the following command command to display maximum number of open file descriptors:\ncat /proc/sys/fs/file-max\n\nTo see the hard and soft values, issue the command as follows:\n# ulimit -Hn\n# ulimit -Sn\n\nTo see the hard and soft values for httpd or oracle user, issue the command as follows:\n# su - username\n\nTo fix the number of maximum files, you can increase the maximum number of open files by setting a new value in kernel variable /proc/sys/fs/file-max as follows (login as the root):\n# sysctl -w fs.file-max=100000\n\nAbove command forces the limit to 100000 files. You need to edit /etc/sysctl.conf file and put following line so that after reboot the setting will remain as it is. To do that, append a config directive as follows:\nfs.file-max = 100000\n\nSave and close the file. Users need to log out and log back in again to changes take effect or just type the following command:\n# sysctl -p\n\nVerify your settings with command:\n# cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max\n\nor:\n# sysctl fs.file-max\n\nThe above procedure sets system-wide file descriptors (FD) limits, however you can limit httpd (or any other users) user to specific limits by editing /etc/security/limits.conf file by editing /etc/security/limits.conf and set the limits as follows:\nhttpd soft nofile 4096\nhttpd hard nofile 10240\n\nThen check them by:\n# su - httpd\n$ ulimit -Hn\n$ ulimit -Sn\n\nIf you've got the problem on other Linux distributions, check the /etc/pam.d/login and make sure you've got pam_limits.so enabled, e.g.\nsession required pam_limits.so\n\n\nA: Using Ubuntu 14.04 I got the described hard limit:  \nuser@notebook:~$ ulimit -Hn 4096  \n\nI could lower it using ulimit, but not increase it, just as the question describes it. As ulimit's manual describes:\n\nonly root can increase the hard limit\n\nSo I tried to set a higher limit in /etc/security/limits.conf like this:  \nuser hard nofile 9999 \n\nand a fresh login like ssh localhost -l user gave me the new limit:  \nuser@notebook:~$ ulimit -Hn 9999\n\nHope this works for you, too.\n\nA: If it is a Service, you can try to set the limit in /etc/systemd/system/{ServiceName}.service add LimitNOFILE=65536\n", "Q: GPT PMBR size mismatch after dd clone I am migrating my Ubuntu EFI boot system to a larger hdd. I used the command \ndd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda\n\nI did not dismount the input file before copying and the output file was fresh unpartitioned space. I have successfully booted from the new larger hdd.\n\n\n*\n\n*fdisk -l reports:\n\nGPT PMBR size mismatch\n\n\n*gdisk reports the old drive size (200GB) and\n\n*PMBR is reporting the new hard drive size (2TB).\nThe error states gdisk w (write) command will work, however gdisk help recommends command xe (relocate backup to end of disk).\nMy goal is to remove the old drive and use the new drive as a primary boot disk with my old grub install intact.\nShall I just go ahead an expand the partitions or should I use one of these commands?\n\nA: Just another datum, I ran into this today resizing an EBS volume on my EC2 instance.  I solved it by running growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1, which resized my partition correctly.\n\nA: Do as the gdisk prompt suggests: Use the e option on the experts' (x) menu to relocate the data structures to the end of the disk. You can accomplish the same thing in parted or GParted if you prefer. IIRC, they do it semi-automatically, although they ask for confirmation.\nOnce you've moved the GPT backup data structures, you can resize your partition(s) using GParted.\n\nA: I want to post an expanded explanation of my trials and error for those trying the same since documentation is rather fragmented and points to several different techniques.\nI wound up using gparted from a live usb. I removed the partitions and rewrote the partition table on the new drive. Gparted has a step sequencer: it copied the partition structure of the old disk, and meanwhile also resized the partitions and copied data for the new disk. It did everything while I slept.\nUsing dd also required a manual update of fstab file which I skipped. I then tried ddrescue (from the Universe package via Synaptic, not Software Center) from live usb which reported it did not work with gpt. It referred me to gparted.\n", "Q: How to copy files in Terminal as root user I have 7000 files I would like to copy to a folder from home/Videos to /usr/share/someplace.

My goal is to be able to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu. However, I am stymied at this point.\nI have managed to create a partition on the disk and install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to it. However, the only way I could find to get the computer to recognize the Ubuntu live CD at startup was to disable UEFI. I can boot into Ubuntu if I go into the BIOS and disable UEFI. However, when I boot in this way, the GRUB does not display, so I don't have the option of booting into Windows.  I can boot into Windows if I go into the BIOS and re-enable UEFI. However, if I do this with boot media selection enabled in the BIOS, and press F12 at system startup, the only available option is Windows Boot Loader.   I don't find this to be a satisfactory solution for the long term.\nI have read Dual boot Win 8 / Ubuntu loads only Win, Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI as well as a few other articles from askubuntu.com and the Ubuntu documentation site.\nI have downloaded and run the Ubuntu Boot-Repair utility. It recognized the UEFI partition even when Ubuntu is running (necessarily) in Legacy mode, but cannot convert my existing (BIOS-based) Ubuntu installation to a UEFI installation unless Ubuntu is already running in UEFI mode, which doesn't help. What must I do to correct this and have a truly dual-boot system?\n\nA: Installing in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode was a mistake. You can probably overcome it as follows, although you may need to experiment and tweak this procedure a bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a USB flash drive or CD-R image of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a medium from said image.\n\n*Disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support in your firmware.\n\n*Disable Secure Boot in your firmware.\n\n*Disable \"fast startup\" in your firmware; and/or ensure that your firmware is set to fully activate your USB devices. (The two are closely related and may be named differently depending on the firmware design.)\n\n*Insert the rEFInd disk.\n\n*Reboot and enter your firmware's built-in boot manager. This is typically done by hitting Esc or a function key, but details vary greatly from one system to another.\n\n*Select the rEFInd disk.\n\n*In rEFInd, locate a Linux kernel and hit the Enter key to boot it. It should boot up into Linux. (If you have a separate /boot partition, you'll need to hit F2 or Insert twice rather than Enter to boot, and add a root= pointer to your root filesystem. If you used default installation options this won't be necessary.)\n\n*Repair the installation in either of two ways:\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFInd to your hard disk, in any of the ways described on its installation page. The easiest way is via a Debian package or PPA. Once installed, you'll use rEFInd rather than GRUB to boot.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair tool. Given the right options, it should replace your BIOS-mode GRUB with an EFI version and everything should begin working. This process involves more of a leap of faith, though; if you got this far, you know that rEFInd is working, but you don't know that whatever Boot Repair does will work.\n\n\n\nYou can optionally re-enable Secure Boot at this point, although this may require jumping through some new hoops. See my general page on the topic or the rEFInd documentation on Secure Boot.\nFor future reference, I've written a page on how to install Linux in EFI mode.\n", "Q: Somebody please help - Ubuntu 14.04 Nvidia and a fujitsu lifebook ah544 For the life of me I can never get graphics working on my Lifebook.

Symlink (hard/soft)? How, can I  symlink the entire directory?\n\nA: You'll need to use a soft link, as you cannot make a hard link with a directory. The syntax for this is ln -s /var/www/Foo WebStorm_Projects.\n", "Q: Cannot install package subversion from deb file On Ubunut 12 VM, I am trying to install svn 1.7 taken from wandisco website.

I was using it on my laptop which has a builtin Broadcom card and it was working as expected. One day, it stopped working. Strange thing is, a couple days back Bluetooth stopped working too and I plugged a dongle to make it work. It was an old laptop and I removed the SSD and installed Windows 8. Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth started working.\nThen I put SSD back to my desktop and the Atheros AR9485 PCIe card which was working earlier would not connect either.

I have a Toshiba Satellite with Windows 7.  Ubuntu has been installed on it and I have used it before.  I haven't used this computer in a while and now I've forgotten the key prompt to have the option to boot to Ubuntu.  The default is Windows.\nI also have pre boot true crypt authentication on this machine.  The thing I've tried is pressing F2.  This brings up the grub but doesn't list Ubuntu as an option. \nI think the solution is a combination of Shift and another F key but I've had zero success over the last few days.     \n\nA: Here what they say in this link\n\nThe user may be able to display the menu in one or more of the following ways:\n\n*\n\n*Holding down the SHIFT key early in the boot process until the menu displays. GRUB 2 searches for a depressed SHIFT key signal during boot. If the key is pressed or GRUB 2 cannot determine the status of the key, the menu is displayed.\n\n\n*Pressing the ESC key during a 3 second window as GRUB 2 runs.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 server tomcat7 won't start on reboot I have tomcat7 running on server for helpdesk ticketing system (SysAid).

Can someone help me? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Check this to see if it is related:\nTomcat7 installation failed via apt-get on Ubuntu 14.04\nBasically, there is a dependency that may be missing (fixed with sudo apt-get install libtomcat7-java), but assuming you already did this, it seems the apt-get package is generically FUBAR and requires post-install massaging (which typically I don't recommend as apt-get reconfigure or other package commands may result in undesirable consequences). \nThus, installing the .tgz (from Apache) manually may be the most stable path of least resistance.\n\nA: The problem is with your system variables.\nYou've CATALINA_HOME defined, but there is no CATALINA_BASE, therefore by default it's the same as CATALINA_HOME, but it's not correct.\n\nCATALINA_BASE: (Optional) Base directory for resolving dynamic portions of a Catalina installation.  If not present, resolves to the same directory that CATALINA_HOME points to.\n\nNormally you should see something like:\n# /usr/share/tomcat7/bin/catalina.sh run \nUsing CATALINA_BASE:   /var/lib/tomcat7\nUsing CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/share/tomcat7\nUsing CATALINA_TMPDIR: /tmp\nUsing JRE_HOME:        /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64\nUsing CLASSPATH:       /usr/share/tomcat7/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/share/tomcat7/bin/tomcat-juli.jar\nUsing CATALINA_PID:    /var/run/tomcat7.pid\n\nIf these variables are not present, either you may define them manually:\n. /etc/default/tomcat7\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64 CATALINA_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat7 CATALINA_BASE=/var/lib/tomcat7 CATALINA_PID=/var/run/tomcat7.pid CATALINA_TMPDIR=/tmp\n/usr/share/tomcat7/bin/catalina.sh run\n\nor configure your /etc/init.d/tomcat7 startup script correctly, as normally it should have these variables at the end:\n# Directory where the Tomcat 6 binary distribution resides\nCATALINA_HOME=/usr/share/$NAME\n\n# Directory for per-instance configuration files and webapps\nCATALINA_BASE=/var/lib/$NAME\n\nCheck content of catalina.sh for more details, as it describes all Environment Variable Prerequisites.\nOtherwise re-install your Tomcat.\n\nA: I also ran into the issue of directory problems. It was after I had removed tomcat 7 and tried reinstalling it. When I had first removed it though, I didn't touch the libtomcat7-java package. Once I ran into the fact it might be that package causing the problem, I did a full removal and reinstall and Tomcat came right up:\nRemove (making sure to include the libtomcat7-java package this time):\nsudo apt-get remove --purge tomcat7 tomcat7-docs tomcat7-admin tomcat7-examples libtomcat7-java\n\nReinstall:\nsudo apt-get install tomcat7 tomcat7-docs tomcat7-admin tomcat7-examples libtomcat7-java\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is that tomcat will start on it's own without an issue. Then you can continue to configure it properly.\n", "Q: Switching disks make boot fail I have two SSD disks with Ubuntu 14.04.02 on both. They don't share the UUID or anything, and they are never plugged at the same time. This is a new disk I got last month and did a fresh install.\nHere's what happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug only disk 1, everything works fine. I can boot and no errors occur\n\n*Unplug disk 1, plug disk 2 and I can boot this system too\n\n*Unplug disk 2, plug disk 1, now disk 1 can't boot anymore. Depending on what boot entry (from the motherboard) I choose I get a \"can't find such device\", \"grub rescue\" or \"insert media\" error. I tried booting using the (U?)EFI option and it also doesn't work. It's not a boot priority problem, it just stops working.\nAfter I run boot-repair on disk 1 it starts working again.\nMy motherboard is a http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/P8P67_LE/ and there's also no \"Fast boot\" option on the bios.\nIt's like it's caching the entries with the UUID or something. I also have two options stuck on the BIOS menu. They are from previous installs like \"Ubuntu\" and \"Windows Bootloader\". They show up even when no disks are plugged in.\n\nA: EFI boot entries are stored in the computer's NVRAM. These entries refer to boot loaders, which are ordinary files stored on the hard disk's EFI System Partition (ESP). In order to uniquely identify these files, the NVRAM entries refer to the partitions on which the files reside by their GUID values, which are unique. Thus, the boot loader entries for your two installations are different and are not interchangeable.\nThe trouble is that some EFIs \"helpfully\" remove entries that they consider invalid. When the computer boots and can't find an entry, it's deemed invalid, and the firmware removes it. Thus, the moment you booted with your first disk unplugged, you lost its entry.\nThis damage is easily undone if you know how, but it's a hassle to fix, especially if you have cause to swap disks a lot. The best solution is to not swap disks on a regular basis. If you must, prepare a CD-R or USB flash drive with my rEFInd boot manager. When you need to boot from a disk whose boot loader entries are lost, use the rEFInd disk to boot Linux. You can then re-create the lost boot loader entry with efibootmgr, as in:\nsudo efibootmgr -c -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grubx64.efi -L \"ubuntu\"\n\nYou might need more or different options, depending on how you partitioned the disk, whether you're booting with Secure Boot active, and perhaps other factors.\nAnother solution, which might or might not work depending on details of your configuration, is to copy your /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu directory to /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT and rename the grubx64.efi or shimx64.efi file to bootx64.efi. The EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi file on the ESP is the fallback boot loader -- it boots if nothing else can. Thus, copying GRUB (or Shim if you're using Secure boot) to that name may make it run automatically when its normal boot entry is lost. This workaround doesn't work on all systems, though.\n", "Q: Problem with deleting photos in Dropbox I can't delete the photos from my full dropbox. It says to retry because I'm not connected.

In linux I have tried Firefox and Chrome but neither show those buttons.\nI recently installed virtualbox with Windows 7 lately for a certain program that doesnt run on WINE so I opened up IE. Sure enough the buttons are present in IE. Then I installed Firefox on Windows 7. The buttons appeared there too!\nThis isnt just one computer either.

I know this because I have a maintenance redirect which does not exist on the new IP and it keeps trying to do this redirect.\nAny thoughts on why this is happening? \n\nA: I know this can be counter-intuitive, but (assuming you're using Chrome) open Developer Tools. (Click the Hamburger->More Tools->Developer tools) Then click the config gear to the top right and check \"disable cache while devtools is open\". \nRefresh the page with devtools open and see if that gets you to the solution. That will force the browser to pull fresh files from the server each time and help you rule the client's side out. The Network section of devtools when you refresh may help as well. I'm thinking it's the browser's cache.\n(Unsure if this is the case, but I could imagine Chrome resolving and storing the IP in cache and only resolving again if that IP doesn't have the file, or a similar mechanism, to minimize unnecessary look-ups.)\n", "Q: Determine RAID 5 config on ubuntu server. Was it hardware or software RAID 5? I am not an experienced Linux or Ubuntu user.  I do have many years of software/hardware tech support experience. A customer brought in a DOA Dell Precision 670 Workstation that was set up as a web server that had been held hostage at a \"Repair Shop\" for over 6 months. It has a RAID 1 Mirror using the on board Dell SATA RAID controller for the OS volume which WILL boot up.  It also has an add on Syba SD-SATA-4P PCI-E RAID card.  There are 4-1.8 TB SATA Drives installed in the drive cage.  Here is my problem....the person that built this box has disappeared which has made me SOL since this box arrived. I have no way of knowing was this a hardware or software RAID 5 config.  The motherboard in this box had blown capacitors, no memory, and the 4 SATA drives which obviously were once connected to the Syba card were disconnected.\nLinux - Ubuntu Server Version 12.04.3 LTS\nI replaced the MB and memory and got the system to boot to linux.  Once booted it says it can't find /var which is obviously supposed to be on RAID 5 volume. I found a cryptic legend scribbled inside the chassis indicating drive 0,1,2,3 connections to Syba card.  I have connected the cables accordingly but the volume is still not found.  The Syba doesn't show any specific RAID settings. Looks like default SATA settings to me.  \nThe one other thing I have is a config sheet that says it is a 4x1.8 TB RAID 5: 3x1.8 TB /var with 1.8 TB spare. Is there a utility I can run to \"peek\" at the settings on the drives? Will it tell me that the drives are configged as linux software RAID 5? \nDo I have to have a syba driver loaded to see the drives?\nI booted a gpart disk and all i see is 1 Logical OS drive RAID1 and the other 4 HD's. \nI am very leary to continue further without some guidance.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nTIA - Brian\nhere are my results.  sorry, I posted that as an answer..\nsudo parted -1 \nunable to mkdir /var/lib/sudo: no such file or directory\n\nsudo blkid /dev/sda3: \nuuid=\"0736942d.......................uuid_sub........label=\"gray2\" type=linux_ raid_member\n\n/dev/sda5: uuid=\"eodf5de1.......................uuid_sub........label=\"file1:125\" type=linux_ raid_member\n\n/dev/sdb3: uuid=\"0736942d.......................uuid_sub........label=\"gray2\" type=linux_ raid_member\n\n/dev/sdb5: uuid=\"eodf5de1.......................uuid_sub........label=\"file1:125\" type=linux_ raid_member\n\n/dev/md2: uuid=\"66ba53ca.........type=\"swap\"\n\n/dev/md125: label=\"Root\" uuid=\"f02218b5.................type=\"ext4\"\n\nI guess what I see is sda3 and sda5 are partitions on drive 0 on board controller \nand...................sdb3 and sdb5 are partitions on drive 1 on board controller \nwhich should actually be mirrored RAID 1\nmd2 is a spare drive or swap file for RAID 5 \nand md125 or ext4 is the RAID 5 logical volume?? \nDoes this mean that it is indeed linux software RAID 5 or is it looking for that volume?? \nAnd most important.... Is it recoverable?\n\nA: You have software raid.  Your output looks odd so I think what you did was run sudo blkid /dev/xxx for each of several block devices.  If you just run sudo blkid with no arguments, it should list everything and there should be /dev/126 and /dev/127 in there.  Those are your raid volumes and those are what you want to mount to access your data on them.  They should just show up in the gui when you boot the live cd and open a file explorer.\n", "Q: xfce4-terminal Color Settings for 'ls' in NTFS Partition Mounted by fstab I have Xubuntu 14.04, and I have an NTFS data partition that mounts at startup via fstab. How could I adjust the color settings for xfce4-terminal beyond the GUI options? For example how could I set up specifically the color or font-weight of directories or files for 'ls'? Most importantly for now, I would like to make my partition directories appear exactly as they do in my Xubuntu partition (or at least remove the highlighting). Screen shot posted here. Much thanks in advance.\n\n\nA: The default highlighting of ls usually marks folders writable by others with that green background. Therefore you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the fmask, dmask or umask values of the mount point to deny write access to others (should be at least 0002). \n\n*See What do the different colors mean in ls? to know what the colors mean and how to set them. For example:\nLS_COLORS=\"$LS_COLORS:ow=\"; export LS_COLORS\n\nThis should make folders writable by others look the same as others.

However I do it from the previously seen cascade menu or by using the keyboard shortcuts the volume just stands still, at the maximum volume I suppose.\nI tried to follow this guide I found on the italian Ubuntu website, even though it is not updated, and got some results through the terminal.\nFirst of all, I think that the audio card has been correctly detected:\nalex@Sargon:~$ cat /proc/asound/cards\n 0 [HDMI           ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel HDMI\n                      HDA Intel HDMI at 0xb3610000 irq 67\n 1 [PCH            ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel PCH\n                      HDA Intel PCH at 0xb3614000 irq 66\nalex@Sargon:~$ lspci | grep -i audio \n00:03.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT HD Audio Controller (rev 0b)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Lynx Point-LP HD Audio Controller (rev 04)\n\nThe audio test doesn't make any sound at all, though.\nalex@Sargon:~$ aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav \nRiproduzione in corso WAVE '/usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Frequenza 48000 Hz, Mono\n\nI tried to use Alsamixer to check the audio settings, but honestly I didn't understand anything in it.

F6 to select soundcard although it looks like it's already selected. \nOne thing to note . . . make sure auto mute is not selected on the alsa mixer. Arrow up and down to control the volume.\nAfter installing alsamixer this feature (automute) is set on by default and must be explicitly disabled.\n\nedit:\nOkay, thanks for posting the errors because they really help us know what's going on. The error says that pulseaudio is still using the modules which is why they fail to reload so we have to stop the puleaudio service. Here's what we'll do. \nFirst, stop pulseaudio service with the following command:\nsudo service pulseaudio stop\n\nNext, reload alsa:\nsudo alsa force-reload\n\nNow, you NEED pulseaudio so start it back up:\nsudo service pulseaudio start\n\n\nA: I was finally able to solve this one.\nI just had to go in the configuration panel of the volume control box:\n\nUnder the \"Audio Interno\" (Internal Audio in english, I suppose) option, where now there is \"Spento\" (shut off) for some reason there was \"Digital Stereo HDMI\".

This might be a strange question, but I am wondering if I could use Google Cardboard to replace my monitor.\nFor this I'd like to connect an Ubuntu-Desktop with an Android Smartphone through Bluetooth (or alternatively USB).\nDoes anybody know how I could accomplish that?\n\nA: I've made a VNC app for Google Cardboard that you could try.

Namely the problem was always a \"problematic frame\" in a static library (.so file), with lots of hexadecimal addresses listed above in the log. Reinstalling Java didn't help, so I tried reinstalling Ubuntu instead, but the problem persisted even after a fresh installation.\nI then checked RAMs for faulty behavior, and soon after having started Memtest86+ v4.2.0 lots of addresses were reported as faulty. I checked if everything in the BIOS was set correctly, and i found out that the memory's Command Rate was set uncorrectly to 1, while from RAM's specifications it should have been set to 2. So i set it to 2 and tested again, this time with 1 full pass of Memtest86+ and 3 full pass of Memtest86 showing no issue.\nIn order to avoid any further problems i burned Ubuntu again to a blank DVD, checked the md5 sum of the DVD, launched Ubuntu as Live DVD and checked the S.M.A.R.T status of the drive, which was ok (Bad sectors reallocation count=0). The problem i'm experiencing now is that the installer fails at checking copied files, i.e. it states that the copied files are different from the source files.\nNow i'm trying to burn the Ubuntu DVD once again, but i highly doubt it might fix the issue. Apparently there's something wrong at hardware level, but i'm unable to figure out what that could be \n\nA: Most likely it was RAMs' fault. After having opened the case, having removed the RAMs and removed lots of dust from their heatsinks, having cleaned everything else from the lots of dust present and having updated the BIOS to a new version which sets the memory timings correctly i was able to reinstall and to use the PC without problems\n", "Q: How can a specify specific bluetooth adapter?

My question is, How do I go back into this configuration and edit my answers?\nThanks in Advance\n\nA: LibreOffice does not have an email client.

In such case , use sudo su yourusername. If you do that make sure that you add line Defaults    timestamp_timeout=7 in /etc/sudoers file so that after 7 minutes if someone wants to run something with root privileges , the won't be able to, because sudo has timed out.

My friend's Ubuntu 14.04 has started endlessly continuing a creepy, staticky voice that repeats words in english, mainly numbers like \"one hundred one\". It happens persistently and consistently, so I could capture a sound clip if anyone wants one. Some other weird things are happening too. BIOS is booting every time we restart when it didn't before, and also every time we muted or unmuted, thunderbird would start and ask if we wanted an account wit gandi.net. We removed thunderbird but that has had no effect on the other problems. Rebooting also has no effect, the talking starts at login. No programs are listed as running in the sidebar. I'm not super familiar with Ubuntu but it seems insane something like this could happen without any program asking for permission to start or anything. Seems kind of like virus symptoms i've seen on windows but isn't Linux immune to that kind of thing?\n\nA: When the (computer) voices are speaking to you, type sudo lsof -t +D /dev/snd to get the PIDs of the processes using sound,  then, ps -F -p <PID> ... to find out about the processes. Here is an example from my system while I was playing music intentionally, YMMV:  \n$ sudo lsof -t +D /dev/snd\n1195\n3713\n$ ps -F -p 1195 -p 3713\nUID        PID  PPID  C    SZ   RSS PSR STIME TTY          TIME CMD\nlightdm   1195  1118  0 89240  2408   1 Mar08 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/pulseau\nwalt      3713  3379  0 110363 4100   0 Mar07 ?        00:01:07 /usr/bin/pulseau\n\nOnce lsof tells you which PIDs are using sound, ps, kill, lsof, sudo /bin/ls -l /proc/<PID>, etc will tell you more.  \nAs always, do man <cmd> before you execute a command from Someone Else, especially if it is sudo cmd. \n\nA: You might check if your screen reader is enabled.

I am embedding a flash file test.swf inside another php file say test.php and uploaded to my server(www.example.com/test.html)\nI need to protect test.swf from unauthorized read.So I changed the permission to 0440(only owner and group can read). I changed the permission of test.php to 0644(owner,group and other) so that everyone can read. Is it possible to view my test.swf inside test.php file at the same time not accessible for those accessing directly.\n\nA: If test.swf (or test.php) is accessed through the local filesystem, the accessor's UID and GID along with the file's (and directory's) permissions govern access.  \nIf test.swf is requested via the web server, then it's rules (and the UID and GID of its user) apply.\nDid I misunderstand? Who is the \"directly accessing unauthorized reader\"?\n", "Q: \"Could not apply the stored configuration for monitors\" ERROR Attempting to upgrade Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 and on restart I get this error. \nCould not apply the stored configuration for monitors\n\nThis is a 64 bit version running in  Parallels 9 Desktop.

Is there a way I can change this sort of thing from the terminal? Can you show me a resource where I can learn more about it?\n\nA: Most of these settings are stored in the dconf database.\nI'd suggest to monitor the dconf change using the donf watch / command and change a desktop setting using the GUI.\nSo first open a terminal and start the dconf monitoring and open the system settings->Appearance menu :\n\nOn close, you can see the above settings stored in the database.\nNow to set a value from your installation script you can use for example:\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/icon-size 32\n\nto set the launcher icon size.\nLook at the dconf and gsettings commands man pages, you can set most of your desktop settings by using this method.\n", "Q: Unable to run 2 ethernet connections at the same time I have a workstation with two ethernet ports (eth0, eth1), the problem is that I cannot run with both ports up and running.

This most often means that you do not get DHCP lease. This, in turn, usually is because your network has no DHCP (not working, or MAC-filtered). Before you proceed, you should ask network admin if you must use dynamic (DHCP) or static IP, and what the numbers are.  \n\nA: In this case, the problem seems to be solved (see comments) by a simple reboot.\nAccording to Barafu Albino, it looks like the DHCP did not give the device an IP address first, but worked after the restart...\nPlease edit this community wiki answer if you can provide additional details about what might have happened or post your own answer.

It's like being on a Windoze machine again :-O\n\nIt only seems to happen at small sizes; it's antialiased at larger sizes. Can I disable this?\nEDIT:\nMy /etc/fonts/config.avail/10-antialias.conf contains\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n<!--  Use the Antialiasing -->\n  <match target=\"font\">\n    <edit name=\"antialias\" mode=\"assign\"><bool>true</bool></edit>\n  </match>\n</fontconfig>\n\nAnd\n% fc-match calibri          \ncalibri.ttf: \"Calibri\" \"Regular\"\n\n\nA: MS-C fonts embedded bitmaps\nPer comments to this answer, the most common problem with MS C-fonts (Cambria, Calibri...) is that they use embedded bitmaps. To change this disable them. Either in\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.fonts.conf \n\n*or ~/.config/font-manager/local.conf in 14.04; Font Manager reserves the right to manage the ~/.fonts.conf file, thanks @Alain)\n\n*or ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf (per @SpinUp and @Glutamine's comments)\nyou need to add this XML snippet:\n\n\n<!-- disable embedded bitmaps in fonts to fix Calibri, Cambria, etc. -->\n<match target=\"font\">\n   <edit mode=\"assign\" name=\"embeddedbitmap\"><bool>false</bool></edit>\n</match>\n\nAntialiasing toggle\nYou should be able if you toggle configs in /etc/fonts/conf.avail/, namely antialiasing, less so autohinting. How to do so: change the true to false in 10-antialias.conf or vice versa and you toggled the antialiasing and can see if it helps. Similarly for 10-autohinting.conf. This toggles the setting for all fonts AFAIR, so just take a look if it helps your case, you'll know if the problem is there or not.\nNote: read-only file needs sudo to be modified (or needs to be made write-also prior to writing to it), so whatever your editor is (mine is vim), run it with sudo: sudo vim /etc/fonts/conf.avail/10-antialias.conf.\n\nCache rebuilding and font-stack changes\nAlso, oft-advised solution with fonts is rebuilding cache: sudo fc-cache -v -f. Especially if you made changes to font stack (installed new fonts, deleted, moved etc.).\nAlso, what does fc-match calibri display? Why I ask: in my case to display Calibri well, I had to fall back to DejaVu Sans, otherwise I had a missing ligatures problem: see my Calibri question here. I did that by deleting the Calibri regular font file (.ttf).

During normal operation the mt-st package is used for this.\nSo i have gone through all the *.udeb packages available in the /cdrom/pool/main tree of in the rescue mode of the ubuntu 14.04 installer image but didn't find a suitable package.\nWhat are the possibilities?\n\nA: As the tape devices /dev/st0 (rewinding tape drive) and /dev/nst0 (non-rewinding tape drive) are discovered, the following workaround worked for me:\ndd if=/dev/st0 of=/dev/zero count=0\n\nrewinds the tape (equals \"mt -f /dev/st0 rewind\").\ndd if=/dev/nst0 of=/dev/zero [bs=<block size>]\n\n\"fast forwards\" to the next file space (equals \"mt -f /dev/nst0 fsf 1\"). But be aware: I saw some \"out of memory\"-messages from the dd command when the tape was created with large \"block size\" (i used 1MiB) and the  was not specified. So you should generally know the \"block size\" when restoring from tapes in the installer environment.\ndd if=/dev/[n]st0 [bs=<block size>] | tar [<tar options>] -f - [<file spec>]\n\nFinally retrieves the data (the \"-f -\" tells tar to read from STDIN).

I was glad I got it booting. So actually I do not remember the current status of the Bios/UEFI/EFI configuration.\nBut anyway, BIOS should work. Could it even be corrupted by the installation process?\nThanx.\n\nA: When you install an OS in EFI mode, it alters the NVRAM settings on the computer to point to the new OS's boot loader. Normally this works fine. My suspicion is that in your case, this change has affected the way the computer reacts to keypresses during startup or has otherwise affected startup options. If I'm right, this is a firmware bug. Some possible fixes spring to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use efibootmgr to view the current entries and remove any that aren't being used. I don't know of a good general efibootmgr tutorial on the Web, but if you do a Web search you'll find descriptions of how to use it to do various specific things. You can also read its man page. In brief, you'd use efibootmgr -v to view current boot entries and then use efibootmgr -b # -B to delete each one you don't want. (Replace # with the number corresponding to the entry you want to delete.)\n\n*Enter the firmware setup utility and review options related to \"fast start\" (disable it) or USB support (enable it). Of course, this poses a chicken-and-egg problem; you can't enter the firmware setup utility now, so you'd need at least a temporary workaround to get into the firmware once. This Acer page describes how to enter the firmware setup utility from Windows, but I'm not sure if it's generic or Acer-specific.\n\n*Configure GRUB to provide a reboot-to-EFI option, or install a boot loader that provides such an option. I'm not sure how to get GRUB to do this, although I thought I'd seen such options in GRUB somewhere along the line. My own rEFInd boot manager and gummiboot both provide this feature. (In the case of rEFInd, it appears as an icon of a computer chip on the second row of icons, and will not be present if the firmware doesn't provide the interfaces necessary for force a reboot into the firmware setup utility.) If you can get to the firmware's built-in boot manager, you could run rEFInd from a USB flash drive or CD-R to use this approach on a one-time or as-needed basis.\n\n*Update your firmware. This might reset things to a usable state, or it might fix the bug that's the real cause of the problem.\n\n", "Q: Pinyin on Trusty I know that this isn't the first message about pinyin and Trusty (and I fear it won't be the last) but I have no clue about how to solve this problem.\nI've installed both simplified and traditional chinese language support, I've set up IBUS to use pinyin and sunpinyin, I've also (as an old message suggested) uninstalled (purged) IBUS and both libpinyin files and reinstalled them but no way to see the IBUS icon on gnome panel. Btw, I'm using gnome-fallback as wm, but is the same if I use Unity or Gnome classic: no icon at all, so no way to change input source. Using  keyboard shortcuts has the same effects: super+space or maj+super+space makes me just to change keyboard layout from italian - my primary language - to polytonic greek (I need sometimes to write in ancient greek so I've configured a greek keyboard too) but no way to get pinyin working or at least to see the input method changer on menubar.\nI've workarounded (if it's possible to call what I did a workaround) the problem by installing Precise on an HD parition, so when I need to use pinyin, I've just to boot into Precise, but that's anyway a pain.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks and have a nice day,\nSilvia\n\nA: I had the same issue when moving from Ubuntu 12 to 14. I had little luck with various ibus-xxx (re)install/remove  . If you don't have to use ibus-pinyin, then this post on fcitx worked well for me.\n\nsudo apt-get install fcitx fcitx-pinyin fcitx-sunpinyin fcitx-googlepinyin\n\nThen run \"Input Method\" from Application (same as\n\nim-config\n\non commandline). After some prompts, select fcitx (from ibus).\nAfter re-login or reboot, click on the keyboard icon, then \"Configure Current Input Method\",  click on \"+\", uncheck \"Only Show Current Language\", search for \"Chinese\" (case-sensitive!) and choose your favorite pinyin method (I used google-pinyin).\nTo switch to the pinyin method, use Ctrl+Space. If needed, click on the new pinyin icon (e.g. \"g\" for google-pinyin) for further configuration. e.g. Toggle between tradition and simplified chinese.\n--EDIT-- (March 16, 2016)\nFinding my own post exactly one year later with exactly the same issue on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 (one on Macbook; the other on PC to remove Win 8 completely). Google pinyin was usable but the word choice and order were strange to me, and it often failed to type on Google Chrome's own search bar.\nSo I landed on ibus-libpinyin (not ibus-pinyin) , one of which is called \"Chinese (Intelligence Pinyin)\" in Text Entry (see below), and documented it here (so I might remember it a year later)\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings -> Language Support -> Install/Remove Languages, and select/install Chinese (simplified or traditional). Ensure the \"Keyboard input method system\" is IBus.\n\n\n*On a Terminal\n\nsudo apt-get install ibus-libpinyin\nibus-daemon -drx\n\n\n\n*Go to System Settings -> Text Entry -> \"+\" and search for \"Chinese\". The entry \"Chinese (Intelligence Pinyin)\" should now appear. Add the method.\n\n\n*To toggle between the input method, it is now Super + Space.\nThe \"Super\" key is the key with Windows logo on my PC keyboard and the Command Key on my macbook.\nRe-login may be necessary if at first the input method behave erratically.\n", "Q: Why Firefox always gets upgraded and Chromium web browser don't? Why Firefox always gets upgraded to the latest version available and Chromium web browser don't get upgraded to the latest version available? they are both open source software. \nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and Firefox version at this moment is 36.0.1 but Chromium version is stuck at 37.0.2062.120 although latest Chrome version available at the moment is 41.0.2272.76. \nThank You \n\nA: The given problem was addressed in a similar post. Here is the link:\nWhy is Chromium not updated automatically as Firefox is?\nHope this helps.\n\nA: If you had a newer version of Ubuntu you'd be on Chromium 41.  However, precise (Ubuntu 12.04) is on a branch of Chromium 37.\nFor maintaining a stable Ubuntu release, the preference is for it to be released with software at a given version and for that software to stay at that version for that release - that is, not to be updated, except to fix bugs or security issues but stay at the same main version number.\nIt is Firefox, in this case, that has the unusual release strategy.  With Firefox, the Ubuntu devs have decided that it's not feasible/preferable to continue to fix bugs in an older version of Firefox so they update to newer versions of Firefox.  In Chromium, by contrast, they appear to be happy for the precise (old LTS) release to continue to support Chromium 37 with patches for the time being.\n", "Q: How can I install the module gateways and find the adress of my routeur I want to determine the address of my router using a python code.\nI've found that I can use this method netifaces.gateways() after the installation of the netifaces library.\nBut my problem is:\nrimeh@rimeh-PC:~$ python \nPython 2.7.3 (default, Dec 18 2014, 19:10:20)     \n[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2    \nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.    \n>>> import netifaces    \n>>> gws=netifaces.gateways()    \nTraceback (most recent call last):    \nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>    \nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'gateways'\n\nI need help,\nthanks.\n\nA: The gateway() is only available since netifaces 0.10.0.

At this mirror of releases.ubuntu.com, there are two sections for \"Desktop Image\" that are very similar:\nA. Upper \"Desktop image\" Section\nThe desktop image allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at all, and at your option to install it permanently later. This type of image is what most people will want to use. You will need at least 384MiB of RAM to install from this image.\nPC (Intel x86) desktop image\nFor almost all PCs.

A screenshot of the original issue continues to exist here with the big black lines next to the sections being referred to here\n\nA: \nNOTE: This issue has been resolved, now, for historical purposes, this screenshot shows the initial issue that was going on.\n\n\nIf we dissect the links in each section, we can find that the two sections are similar, but point to different ISOs on the same server.\n(The mirror you're looking at mirrors the master releases page as well, but for clarity, you should edit your question to make note that the 'link' to the download page you have is to a mirror, not the master cdimage server)\nThe first upper \"Desktop Image\" section has links to the 14.04.2 LTS ISOs, which are really just respins of the ISOs with updated kernels, updated packages, newer Hardware Enablement Stacks, etc.  You should be using the images in this section, instead of the other section.\nThe second lower \"Desktop Image\" section has the original 14.04 LTS ISOs.  It has the original kernel, original packages, original hardware enablement stack, etc. from the first 14.04 ISO.\nThat's the only difference on that page (but it could be displayed better).\n\nI found out from one of the mirrors vanguards that this is by-design, however it could be improved and I had filed a ticket on Ubuntu's RT (tickets) tracker to get this made known and recommend the addition of headers for those sections to detail the individual variants, to add clarity.\nThe Ubuntu Mirrors team (thanks, Paul Gear for handling the ticket) has removed the second section which pointed to the 14.04 original ISOs, and they have left the 14.04.2 section there.

What information is needed to diagnose the issue?\nFor example, on my system (HP G60, with Ubuntu Mate 14.04 64-bit install), I opened the file /etc/modprobe.d/wlan.conf in pluma, and it had 3 lines in which led_mode=1 existed.\nSome of the other advice, mentioned MODULE NAME and that mine would be listed below. It didn't seem to list any for 14.04, how would I know what the module name is for Ubuntu Mate 14.04 specifically?\nI realize this question may be difficult to answer without a dump from lspci, which I will do later this evening once I get home. I know only at this time it is Atheros.\nThanks in advance,\nAdam \n[[appending info below, based on answer]] - I was able to determine module name as \"ath5k\"\n$ modinfo ath5k\n\nfilename:       /lib/modules/3.13.0-44-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/ath5k.ko\nlicense:        Dual BSD/GPL\ndescription:    Support for 5xxx series of Atheros 802.11 wireless LAN cards.\n...\nparm:           no_hw_rfkill_switch:Ignore the GPIO RFKill switch state (bool)\nthe file /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi,conf already contained (as the last line in the file)\noptions iwlwifi led_mode=1\n\nSo, i'm not sure how to proceed at this point. Do I seek the electrical tape? LOL\nEdit (March 12, 2015) Got the annoying blink to stop. Found at Wireless LED doesn't stop blinking on an HP dv5 with an Atheros AR5007\n\nA: The module name is found in:\nsudo lshw -C network\n\nHere is a redacted example from my computer:\n*-network\n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: Centrino Advanced-N 6200\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 35\n       serial: xx:94:6b:99:55:xx\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=iwlwifi driverversion=3.16.0-31\n\nAs you can see, the driver is iwlwifi, in this example.\nNow, as to whether we can control the LED, we turn to: modinfo <your_driver>, in this example iwlwifi. We see, in part:\nparm:           led_mode:0=system default, 1=On(RF On)/Off(RF Off), 2=blinking, 3=Off (default: 0) (int)\n\nTherefor, if we wish to change the behavior of the LED, we would add to the already existing iwlwifi.conf file:\nsudo -i\necho \"options iwlwifi led_mode=3\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\nexit\n\nIn the case of many drivers, the behavior is not manipulable; in some cases, the driver parameter is found in one of the driver's dependencies. In my example, iwlwifi also loads iwldvm, cfg80211 and mac80211. I find this in:\nlsmod | grep iwl\n\nIf I saw no method to change the LED behavior in iwlwifi, I'd check every dependency. In some cases, the only option is electrical tape.\nOnce you know your driver, if you get stuck, post back and I'll be happy to assist.\nAgain, in the case of many drivers, the behavior is not manipulable.\n", "Q: Shall I install update for my self installed emacs? Yesterday, I installed the latest Emacs 24.4-1 from its official site by compiling its source code, because the one in repository is older.\nBut today the software update notifies me if I want to install software update including emacs:\nChanges for emacs versions:\nInstalled version: 24.4-1\nAvailable version: 45.0ubuntu1\n\nVersion 45.0ubuntu1: \n\n  * Default to emacs24.\n\n\nVersion 45.0: \n\n  * Provide the emacs metapackage (previously produced by emacs23,\n    emacs24, etc.).\n\n  * Set the initial dependencies to Emacs 23 (for the wheezy release).\n\n  * Set the initial version higher than any existing emacs binary package.\n\nI am not clear about what it says.

If you install the emacs snap package it will be updated automatically in the background. In all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo snap install emacs --classic\n\nSnap packages have been installable in Ubuntu since Ubuntu 14.04 if snapd is installed using sudo apt install snapd. In Ubuntu 16.04 and later the snapd package is installed by default.\nSimilarly you can install the latest versions of many other common applications by searching for their snap packages in the Software app. An example is this question: New to Linux, trying to install FFmpeg but missing dependencies from LibaV where installing the ffmpeg snap package which has no dependencies resolved a The following packages have unmet dependencies: error message that occurred when trying to install ffmpeg with sudo apt install ffmpeg.\n", "Q: Ubuntu resolution problem after updating on virtual box I have just updated my ubuntu to ubuntu trusty and its all zoomed (I guess the resolution).

I have wondered about that a lot, is it safe to just unplug the Bluetooth Adapter just like because in Windows we use to have The Safety Remove option and for USB drives or SD card I can unmounted them from Disk Utility and then just unplug them.\nthank you \n\nA: Safely Remove External Storage\nSuch as an USB drive\nWith external storage media like USB drive or SD card, the computer (Widnows or Ubuntu) does not write the changes to files immediately. That is, when you copy or modify a file in an USB drive, the computer puts it in a \"to do\" list and waits until there are enough things \"to do\" with the USB drive. This is done because it is more efficient to write many small changes at the same time as compared with writing them one at a time when you make them. So, you don't use the safely remove option and just yank out the USB drive out, those changes don't get done and the file may get corrupted.\nSee more at http://www.howtogeek.com/172931/why-exactly-do-you-need-to-safely-eject-usb-media/\nBluetooth Dongles Don't Store Data\nThey can be yanked out, as long as there is no data transfer going on\nThis is not the case with the Bluetooth adapter. For example, if you try to listen to some music using Bluetooth headset and the adapter, the computer can't wait and consolidate the music to be sent to the headset. It has to be done right away. Otherwise you will think your adapter is broken. Similarly, if you use Bluetooth to transfer files between your phone and your computer, it is done right away and when it says the transfer is complete, it is complete. So, I don't see why there should be a safely remove option for Bluetooth adapter.\nAlso see http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/forums/1/tech-helproom/209172/safely-remove-a-belkin-bluetooth-dongle/\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How does one change the default directory for R version 3.0.2 to a user specified directory in Ubuntu 14.04? I have just started using R and want to change the default directory from '/home' to a user specified one.\n\nA: You can set R's working directory by… changing the directory from where you run it from. So\ncd /foo/bar\nR\n\nwill start R in /foo/bar.\nIf you want to always start R in a particular directory, you can change the working directory in the application starter. To achieve that, you need to create a copy of the application starter /usr/share/applications/R.desktop in your user application starter directory ~/.local/share/applications/ and add a line starting with Path= and then insert the desired path name.\nShort example for the command line:\necho \"Path=/foo/bar\" | cat /usr/share/applications/R.desktop - > ~/.local/share/applications/R.desktop\n\n", "Q: I can't open Firefox I can't open Firefox.

Is there any application which will ask for root access? To whom shall I report this problem?\n\nA: This is normal - Ubuntu has this out of the box.\nWhat you can do, is restrict access to the actual command that allows you editing network settings, the nm-connnection-editor.\nOpen terminal with Ctrl + alt + T, and enter the following commands: \n\n\n*\n\n*ls -l $(sudo which nm-connection-editor) ; This will show current permissions for the nm-connection-editor\n\n\n2.sudo chmod 700 $(sudo which nm-connection-editor) ; this will change the permissions\n\n\n*Repeat the command #1, to make sure you have changed the permissions. Now try editing the connections.\n\n\nNOTE : in case you ever want to go back to editing , you will need to enter this command sudo chmod 755 $(sudo which nm-connection-editor) to make the editor accessible again\n\nA: Besides the answer provided earlier I was going for a different direction and after some research created another answer.\nAfter creating wi-fi connection the next step would be to edit the keyfile corresponding to it. With root permissions, edit the keyfile which is  located in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections.\nWithin [wifi-security] section add the psk flag below your password:\npsk=yourpassword\npsk-flags=1\n\nIt is added to make sure the password maintain non visible. Now, the connection's properties cannot be changed without typing the password. The drawback is that Network Manager must be restarted in case you want to disconnect/connect again, otherwise you will have to type in password each time. For that we can use a script, but note you must uncheck autoconnect option with this method. Open text editor and paste following:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ \"$2\" = \"down\" ];then\n    case \"$CONNECTION_UUID\" in\n        12e5ffbb-ec82-465a-a405-04e5072cebba)\n        service network-manager restart;;\n        *) ;;\n    esac\nfi\nexit 0\n\nReplace UUID from script with the one from your connection (or pipe several for multiple connections). It can be retrieved with nmcli connection show command. Save the script to your home folder and name it restart_wireless. Then move it to /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d folder:\nsudo mv '~/restart_wireless' /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d\n\nand change permissions:\nsudo chmod 755 '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/restart_wireless'\n\nAt this point you might experience password being visible after logout/login. It is due to default keyring setting. To prevent this you might add new item to Startup Applications:\n/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --replace --components=secrets\n\nand all pass-phrases will be flushed each time you login. Do this only if you don't have other applications corresponding to your keyring settings.\nRestart for effect.\nAfter this procedure Wi-Fi password is not shown in Network Connections:\n\nPROS:\n\n\n*\n\n*password cannot be accessed with command line tools\n\n*there is no need to alter GNOME Keyring settings\n\n*ability to use Network connections GUI\n\n*ability to use Wi-fi connection within Guest session \n(although it might be interesting to reproduce those restrictions as well)\nCONS:\n\n\n*\n\n*cannot use 'Automatically connect to this network when is available' option\n\n*passwords will be flushed each time on login\n\n\nSource\n", "Q: Hide one of two terminals in launcher?

I want to hide the second one from the launcher and \"minimize it to tray\" (that's how I would call it in Windows).\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: Using the script below to toggle visibility (with a key combination), you can have one terminal window (completely) hidden when minimized, as if it wouldn't exist, while another terminal window keeps visible in the launcher when minimized. \nCreate a separate profile for the hidden terminal window\nThe trick is to create a separate profile in the gnome-terminal preferences, with a distinctive name in the window title. This makes it possible to identify the terminal window with the wmctrl -l command and unmap it with xdotool's windowunmap command, making it invisible in the Launcher.\nToggle visibility / open a \"hidable\" window with a key combination\nYou will have to set up a key combination to toggle visability of the terminal window, since it is not visible in the launcher (see further below).\nHow to setup\nThe script needs both xdotool and wmctrl to be installed:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a separate profile in gnome-terminal preferences: choose \"Edit\" > \"Profiles\", click \"New\". \n\n\n*\n\n*Name the new profile (exactly) \"Hidden\"\n\n*In the \"Title & Command\" tab, set the window title to (exactly) \"Hidden_Profile\", to be placed before window title:\n\nN.B. You might have to log out / in for the profile to be \"loadable\"\n\n\n*Test if the profile works by running the command:\ngnome-terminal --window-with-profile=Hidden\n\na window should pop up, with \"Hidden_profile\" in the window title:\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as run_hidden.py\n\n*Test run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/run_hidden.py\n\nWhat it should do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run it if no terminal window from the separate profile is running: a new terminal should open from the separate (\"hidable\") profile.\n\n*Run it a second time: the window will be (completely) hidden, also from the launcher\n\n*Run it a third time: the window should re-appear\n\n\n*If all works fine, add the (command to run-) the script to a shortcut combination:  choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/run_hidden.py\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\n\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\nhidden_windowid = home+\"/.window_id.txt\"\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef execute(cmd):\n    subprocess.check_call(cmd)\n\ntry:\n    w_id = [l.split()[0] for l in get([\"wmctrl\", \"-l\"]).splitlines() if \"Hidden_Profile\" in l][0]\n    execute([\"xdotool\", \"windowunmap\", w_id])\n    with open(hidden_windowid, \"wt\") as out:\n        out.write(w_id)\nexcept IndexError:\n    try:\n        with open(hidden_windowid) as read:\n            w_id = read.read()\n        execute([\"xdotool\", \"windowmap\", w_id])\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        execute([\"gnome-terminal\", \"--window-with-profile=Hidden\"])\n\nExplanation\nThe script uses wmctrl to identify the window by its (window-) name, as we gave it in the separately created profile for this purpose. Once we have the id, we can unmap it with xdotool's windowunmap command.\nTo make sure we can make the window reappear, the id is stored in a hidden file; if re-mapping fails, the script concludes there is no window opened from the special profile, and it opens one by the command:\ngnome-terminal --window-with-profile=Hidden\n\n\nA: To give you the ability to accept the solution you chose as an answer, I repeat my comment from above. Although it is just a simple workaround and can not really concurrent with @JacobVlijm's impressive answer!\nSo my hint to you was to just enable the use of different workspaces in your system settings panel. When you have a window opened in one workspace, it is not visible in the others. \nBut with Unity, the icon in the Launcher gets highlighted anyway, even if the only open window is in another workspace.\nIn other DEs (I know XFCE and LXDE), this is not the case. The panel/taskbar does not show running programs of inactive workspaces there.\n\nA: I used Tilda for this in the past. It has nice feature of showing up and hiding like it's namesake did in Doom or Quake. If you prefer Python version, it's there as well, name's Guake.\nIt's basically another terminal app, that binds itself to a key combo, and shows only when you press said key combo (hides of course on it as well). \nsudo apt-get install guake - for Tilda see it's page.\nNow, obviously you may not want another terminal app, for some one is just enough. Some though, prefer more than one, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's different app for a different purpose\n\n*it's cool when it slides down, it's cool it stays hidden when not needed\n\n*they liked Quake\n\n\nA: There's a built-in option to do that, but it's a little bugged:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the first Terminal (the one that you want to be visible) using Ctrl+Alt+t\n\n*Open the second Terminal (the one that you want to be hidden) using Ctrl+Alt+t.\n\n*Make the second Terminal the active window, then hit Ctrl+Alt+s and click elsewhere.\n\n\nTo retore the hidden Terminal, click on the Terminal icon in the launcher.\nThe problem with this method is that sometimes, due to a bug, you'll need to close all the visible Terminals first in order for the hidden Terminal to show up again.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Samsung Chromebook 2 boots to Chrome OS I successfully installed Ubuntu 14.04 but it boots to OS (dev mode) and I don't know how to switch to Ubuntu.

My aliases currently look like:\n# Reload pulse audio devices\nalias rldpulsdev='sudo service avahi-daemon restart'\n\n#Wine needs to use ALSA directly. PulseAudio interferes with it.\n#kill pulseaudio\nalias kpa='echo \"autospawn = no\" > ~/.config/pulse/client.conf;sudo service pulseaudio stop'\n#start pulseaudio\nalias spa='echo \"autospawn = yes\" > ~/.config/pulse/client.conf;sudo service pulseaudio start;rldpulsdev'\n\nProblem: If I kill pulseaudio using the above alias, all of the devices disappear from the sound management widget and the speaker icon disappears from the tray. That's OK for when pulse is off but I want the start alias to fix this. The \"rldpulsdev\" alias above is part of the puzzle but I'm definitely still missing something. Clue please?  If I fiddle around with it and maybe restart or relog, it fixes itself eventually but this in itself implies there's something I can do to fix it from an alias. \n\nA: On Ubuntu Pulse Audio is designed to run in userspace. Running Pulse Audio as a service in system wide mode is possible but not recommended as it may cause too many other issues, and other applications in userpace (e.g. Avahi) or applications that rely on pulseaudio in userspace  can not communicate with the sound server.\nOnly in case we run Pulse Audio as a user configuration files in ~/.config/pulse/ will be read. Otherwise only settings from /etc/pulse are valid. Therefore any changes to settings of Pulse Audio running in system-wide mode can not be defined in any user's HOME.\nThe recommended way to temporarily suspend pulseaudio for running Wine with ALSA would be:\npasuspender -- wine <options) <windows-program>\n\nTo stop pulseaudio running as a user we can issue\npulseaudio -k\n\nThis can also be included in a script or alias. Per default pulseaudio will then immediately respawn. If we had disabled this we start pulseaudio simply by\npulseaudio\n\nSettings from ~/.config/pulse will overriding global settings in /etc/pulse if present. \nNote that we do not need (and should not use) root permissions for both commands.\n", "Q: Boot from Ubuntu live USB stick ('Try Ubuntu'). How to see USB disk contents? I am booting from a USB stick, using the option 'Try Ubuntu'. The USB drive contains some files that I need to see. Is there a way to see the drive contents?\n\nA: There are two things you should know:\n1) To look in a USB stick, it has to be mounted. Try mounting it with the mount command. Look in your /dev/ directory for the file to mount, it will be title sdXY, where X is a letter, usually 'b' or 'a' and Y is optional, but typically a number between 1 and 9.\n2) As mentioned above, if you had files on the USB before making it a live USB, the files are reformatted and essentially gone. You can use gparted or a similar program to partition the drive which allows for storing files and having a Live Drive on the same key.\n", "Q: How I can upgrade gnome to latest(Testing or Unstable release) on ubuntu?

I had to do a clean install of Ubuntu on the partition with Ubuntu on it due to some problems I had with the kernel version. \nI ran boot-repair and this was the output. From my understanding (which is little), I think I deleted the windows partition with the new Ubuntu partition.\n\nA: You were right, the only remains of your Windows installation is the (U)EFI partition at the beginning of the disk (vfat). The other two partitions are Ubuntu (ext4) and a swap partition. You can see it here:\nPartition    Start Sector    End Sector  # of Sectors System\n/dev/sda1           2,048     1,050,623     1,048,576 EFI System partition\n/dev/sda2       1,050,624 1,448,605,695 1,447,555,072 Data partition (Linux)\n/dev/sda3   1,448,605,696 1,465,147,391    16,541,696 Swap partition (Linux)\n\nI'm not sure what your question is from this point, but if you haven't made a back-up of your personal data from your Windows partition, then it will be very hard (or impossible?) to recover anything, however others might know more about data recovery than I do. (If that is your question, please make it clearer in your description.)\nHowever, if you want to reinstall Windows, you should be able to do so from an installation drive. It is usually considered harder or riskier to install Windows on top of Ubuntu, but if you manage your partitions carefully and recover GRUB at the end of the installation process, you should be able to get the job done.\nTo manage your partitions before installing Windows, I suggest using GParted on a live session.

I'm using Ubuntu 14.10 and would like to be able to have different screen resolutions on different workspaces. I was thinking of writing a script/daemon that calls xrandr whenever it detects a switch – the question is, how does one detect a change?\n\nA: The question marked as providing an answer does indeed provide an ample solution to my specific problem, but is a slightly narrower question. In the interests of the community, I shall summarise the parts relevant to this broader question, and in a more general manner:\nThe tool one requires is wmctrl (installable through apt-get install wmctrl). wmctrl -d gives information about the current desktop, including (DG) the total size of the virtual desktop (i.e. the combined size of all workspaces) and (VP) the absolute position of the top-left corner of the current workspace relative to the virtual desktop. The column of the currently active workspace can be determined by dividing the x-coord of VP by the horizontal part of the current screen resolution. The row of the current workspace can be calculated using the y-coord of VP and the vertical part of the current resolution. To detect a switch, one should use a while loop to constantly check the row and column of the current workspace and determine if it has changed / meets a certain test.\n", "Q: Does Windows recognize symlinks created under Ubuntu? Before, I dual installed Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7. They shared a Windows ntfs partition by mounting the partition under Ubuntu. I don't remember if the symlinks created under Ubuntu could be recognized by Windows.\nNow, I have Windows 8.1 running inside VirtualBox in Ubuntu 14.04. I also installed some guest addition on the virtual machine for windows for sharing folder. In the shared folder, I found that the Windows can follow the symlinks created on an ext4 filesystem under Ubuntu. Why does that work? Is it \n\n\n*\n\n*because Windows can recognize symlinks of Linux, (just it would on dual boot? but this link says no?)\n\n*or because the shared folder is mounted as a network drive, \n\n*or because of VirtualBox or the guest addition?\n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: When running inside a VM, Windows does not have direct access to the host's filesystem, which contains your shared folder (actually, if that was possible it would most certainly destroyed the filesystem when two OSes tried to write data to it).\nInstead, VirtualBox (guest additions) provides a translation layer between your guest OS and the host filesystem. From the host's point of view, VirtualBox is just another user-space application which reads and writes to the filesystem using kernel's system calls, so it does not care about the actual filesystem type as long as kernel understands it.\nFor Windows (or another host OS) it looks like a network drive, so it can access the data as it would on any other network drive.\n", "Q: the selected disc is of gpt partition style error I want to install windows 8, but I am getting this error the selected disc is of gpt partition style.

Anyway, what you were looking for is\nsed 's/:/ /g' <<<\"$PATH\"\n\nThere's no reason to save in another variable, nothing you do this way will affect the value stored in the variable. You need the assignment operator (=) for that. The syntax used above is called a \"here string\" and is specific to bash, ksh and zsh. It serves to pass a variable's value as input to a program that reads from standard input. \nI have written up an answer on U&L that lists all the various shell operators like this one. You might want to have a look.\nNote that you could also have done\necho \"$PATH\" | sed 's/:/ /g' \n\nFinally, you really don't need sed at all for this. You can do the whole thing in bash directly:\necho \"${PATH//:/ }\"\n\nThe above is a bash replacement construct. Given a variable $var, a pattern pat and a replacement (rep), to replace all occurrences of pat with rep, you would do\necho \"${var//pat/rep}\"\n\nThe same thing with a single slash replaces only the first occurrence:\necho \"${var/pat/rep}\"\n\n\nA: May be:\n~$ x=\"$PATH\"\n~$ x=\"$(echo $x | sed 's/:/ /g')\"\n~$ echo \"$x\"\n/usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/local/games /usr/games\n\n", "Q: Urban Terror Updater frozen I'm trying to install Urban Terror via their \"Urban Terror Updater\" and it's been downloading files for a while but it froze.

I took an old work laptop (Dell Vostro) that used to have win7 installed. Since installing ubuntu, every 20 min or so while I am using Chrome, all the bars on my wifi signal disappear and the internet does not work. It was def not the router because everything else was working fine. At first I just rebooted and it came back. I figured it was a fluke thing until it continued. It doesn't have any issues if I am just using the laptop. But if I am using a browser, it keeps happening.\nI tried to reset the drivers via the terminal.\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart \n$ sudo service networking restart \nstop: Job failed while stopping  \nstart: Job is already running: networking\n\nNeither cmd did anything.\nI then tried unchecking Wifi Enabled via the GUI.

The C compiler (gcc) comes standard and you can install an IDE or text editor via Ubuntu Software Center. Ubuntu Software Center has a section for Developer Tools which has a subsection IDEs. You can also search for software in the search box.  I would recommend starting with Geany for an IDE, or Kate or jEdit if using a source code editor and compiling at the command line.\n\nA: In order to write and to compile any C program, what is required (regardless of the platform, so Ubuntu is included) is just a text editor to write the code and a C compiler to compile the source file(s). A standard Ubuntu installation comes by default bundled with both multiple programs to edit text files (for example a GUI-based one is gedit) and with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). So in order to write and to compile any C program, you won't need to install any additional software.\nThat being said, installing an IDE is suggested, expecially for use with more complicated projects. Personally I use Eclipse CDT.\n", "Q: Unmet dependencies - cannot remove package libgbm1 In this case I have the libgbm1 being held, giving me message like: \nError, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.\n\nSince I carefully read How do I resolve unmet dependencies after adding a PPA?

However, remove command gave me the same error.\nsudo apt-get upgrade doesn't upgrade this package (\"...and 1 not upgraded.\"). And I need this one to build some other packages that depends on it (pkgProblemResover problem again). It seems I cannot revert the version nor move forward.\nSteps I've ever tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*disabling some ppa repositories in software updates and sudo apt-get update then tried to fix with apt, which didn't work.\n\n*sudo apt-get -f install with and 1 not upgraded.\n\n*tried to install packages that libgbm1 depends on. But more packages coming forward and quickly piles up to tens of them, which seems unreliable to handle, and they also reported similar errors.\n\n\nWhy couldn't I remove the package? How to fix it?\n\nA: The problem here is to lock down the trouble maker package and kick it out. Then you can fix inconsistent dependencies with sudo apt-get -f install.\nSo with cautious you may use: sudo dpkg --force-all -P libgbm1 to force removing the broken. This command may damage your system, so you should watch it. And try to fix: sudo apt-get -f install.\nIf any packages are corrupting as well, repeat above steps cautiously. And each time you removed broken packages, try to fix them. I tackled my problem in this case.\n\nA: Force Reconfigure or Remove Broken Packages with DPKG\nReconfigure DPKG, the base package management system, with the following command:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nCheck if DPKG marked some packages as needing a reinstall.\nsudo dpkg -l | grep ^..R\nIf the command above returns a list of one or more packages, try removing the packages by typing:\nsudo dpkg --purge --force-all libgbm1\nAfter you finish troubleshooting, run the following command to clean up the system:\nsudo apt clean\nThen update the repositories:\nsudo apt update\nThen upgrade the repositories:\nsudo apt upgrade\nHope it helps.\n\nA: Instead of rushing to remove your broken packages using the --force-all option of dpkg, first try removing it without this option, using simply\ndpkg -P package-name\n\nIn my case, dpkg printed why it couldn't remove this package: another package depended on it. After I removed the dependee, the broken package could finally be removed, without any --force-anything.\nThis may require several recursive removals in case when the dependee is also broken, but the end result should be fixing the dependency chain, which apt was unable to fix, by removals.\n", "Q: Where is Teamviewer installed?

However, if I call mount on the bound folder twice, it mounts it twice!\nThe same thing occurs if I run mount -a.\nHow do I tell fstab to only mount the folder once? I don't know what the effect of mounting the same directory twice will be, but I imagine it's probably not good.\nI've thought of writing a shell script to call mount -l to check if the folder is mounted, then only mount it if not, but it seems weird to me that the mount command would not already have this option.\nSo, specific questions:\n· Why can mount detect that a non-bind mount is already mounted, but it can't detect that a bind mount is, even though after binding twice it shows up twice in mount -l?\n· How do I tell etc/fstab to only mount if not already mounted?\n· How do I tell the mount command, to not mount if already mounted?\n(I'm using ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS)\n\nA: You are simply not supposed to call mount -a unless you are init script or some other system program. Why do you need this?\nbut yes, you can test it in shell script\nmountpoint -q /home/benubird/Music && echo is mounted || echo not mounted\n\nhowever it does not work very well with bind mounts, sou you can grep /proc/mounts instead:\nfunction is_mounted() {\n    dir=$(echo \"$1\" | sed -e 's/\\/\\/*/\\//g; s/\\/$//g;')\n    cut -d ' ' -f 2 /proc/mounts  | grep \"^$dir$\" >/dev/null\n}\n\n", "Q: Problem, cannot set brightness on Lenovo Z570 My problem is that I cannot set brightness using fn+arrows and any other way.\nI'm currently using elementary os base on 12.04 and that problem is not showing, but on every ubuntu with higher number I can not, in fact I cannot set on any distro whatsoever [I had try with newest: Fedora, Mint, Ubuntu, OpenSuse and Mint debian based].\n Also installing propriertary driver does not help.\nPlease if anyone had same problem share yours knowledge.

I have to run all of them through a web server to get a list of output. This list, however returns many more lines, than I'm interested in. Say, my list.txt is:\na.1\nb.1\netc\n\nthen the output is output.txt:\na.1 a b c\na.2 b a b\na.3 d k o\nb.1 b o p\nb.2 o i y\nb.3 p i y\netc\n\nIs it possible to use the grep command to search for all words in list.txt in the output.txt and then generate \"the wanted\" list wanted.txt? I need the  entire line in my output.txt\nI'm new in scripting, but what I'd like is something such as\ngrep list.txt output.txt > wanted.txt\n\nI haven't been able to find any examples of this\n\nA: I'd ignore grep for this one. It's good for regular expressions but it doesn't look like you really need that here. comm can compare two files and show you intersections. Using your exact examples:\n$ comm -12 list.txt output.txt \na.1\nb.1\netc\n\n\n*\n\n*-1 suppresses lines unique to the first file\n\n*-2 suppresses lines unique to the second file\n\n*-3 suppresses lines common to both\n\n*To get just the common lines, we suppress the unique lines, hence -12\nThis is faster than any grep will be but it relies (heavily) on the files being sorted. If they aren't, you can pre-sort them but that will alter the output so it's sorted too.\ncomm -12 <(sort list.txt) <(sort output.txt) \n\n\nAlternatively, this answer from iiSeymour will let you do it with grep. The flags ask for an input file and force a fixed-string, full-word search. This won't rely on order but will be based on the output.txt order. Reverse the files if you want them in the order of the list.txt.\n$ grep -wFf list.txt output.txt \na.1\nb.1\netc\n\n\nIf your list.txt is really big, you might have to tackle this a little more iteratively and pass each line to grep separately. This will massively increase processing time. In the above you'd be reading output.txt once, but this way you'd read and process it for every list.txt line. It's horrible... But it might be your only choice. On the upside, it does then sort things by the list.txt order.\n$ while read line; do grep -wF \"$line\" output.txt; done < list.txt\na.1\nb.1\netc\n\n", "Q: Laptop screen turns off automatically while using Ubuntu 14.04 I am using dual boot Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7. \nMy laptop screen turns off automatically after some time in Ubuntu while the system still remains on.

I have an fstab entry to automatically mount the drive at /mnt/external, which then gets shared automatically by the various daemons.\nThe problem is if the drive doesn't mount properly (e.g. if I forgot to turn it on, or if I took it to work that day). In this case the mountpoint gets shared without the corresponding drive attached, resulting in various meta files getting written to my mount point rather than a clean failure. This prevents the drive from mounting properly the next time I attach it (non-empty directory), and could lead to data loss if someone used the share in the mean time.\nIs there any way to cause the shares to fail in the case that the drive is unmounted?\n\nA: You can set your original mount folder attributes to make it immutable:\nchattr +i /mnt/external\n\nThe folder is now locked and any operation on it is forbidden (you can unlock it using -i).\nHowever mount or fstab still work properly.\n\nMake sure the drive is not mounted before running chattr. If you get the error \"Inappropriate ioctl for device While reading flags\", maybe your are working on a filesystem that doesn't support attributes on folders. In fact some Linux distributions mount the main partition using overlayfs filesystem instead of ext.

I find this to be the easiest way to install Linux.\nWith the live CD you should be able to boot up a working version of Ubuntu where you could do this through the GUI, just make sure you select your cd drive in your boot options (Mine is F12) on system startup.\nKeeping regular backups is always great practice too (especially before planning to make any system changes)\n\nA: *\n\n*\"Try Ubuntu\" with live CD\n\n*reinstalled desktop, didn't fix\n\n*changed own of /home, and reinstalled suspicious nvidia driver by\nsudo chown -R $USR:$USR /home/$USR  # $USR is your username\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get purge nvidia-* && sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nAnd everything's back to life.\nThe most suspicious reason was that you accidently changed own of /home to root.

But I'm receiving errors with the last two steps in installing region on cloud (configure availability zones and neutron network). \nI'm using virtual machines on Ubuntu Virt-manager and MAAS. To go to the installation step I first need to have two networks in MAAS, and during configuring them again I have to delete one and have just public network. Can this be a problem?\nLast time after starting of installation i have added again my private network to MAAS and these are logs of the errors:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/10579745/\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: No, you shouldn't have to change the networking between the checklist and the configuration pages.\nSince you are using VMs, let's try something simple to begin with.\nFirst, make sure your VMs have enough RAM. The bootstrap node, that's the machine with 2 NICs, will need at least 4Gb, maybe 8Gb, since it will host all the administrative services like mysql, rabbit and others. All the rest should have ideally 2Gb or more. I'm being conservative here, since I know these are VMs and you seem to be just testing things out before moving on to a more real deployment. Even 2Gb might not be enough. For a real deployment I would expect all nodes to have at least 16Gb of RAM.\nHave only one network, and plug all NICs to it. For the VM that has two NICs, plug both of them to the same network. Like in this image:\n\nYou can see that one node has both NICs connected to the same network. Delete all your MAAS nodes and enlist them again in this configuration.\nWhen configuring this network in MAAS, divide it in three pieces:  dynamic range, static range and a range reserved for floating IPs. MAAS only cares about the first two, but leave room for the floating IPs that OpenStack will want later on.\nFor more details, please see the following Q/A:\n\n\n*\n\n*How should I setup MAAS so that it can be used by the Canonical OpenStack Autopilot?\n", "Q: integrate apps to ubuntu without Ubuntu Software Center I want to install a program which is not inside ubuntu Software : Processing.\nI downloaded the tar.gz package, followed this doc - create a processing.desktop file inside /usr/share/applications/ - and the program works from the terminal. \ninside processing.desktop : \n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nEncoding=UTF­8\nName=Processing\nGenericName=Processing\nComment=Un environnement de développement pour le langage Processing\nIcon=/usr/share/processing/processing.png\nExec=/usr/share/processing/processing-2.2.1/processing\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=false\nCategories=Development;Electronics' > processing.desktop\n\nBut I would like an integration : Processing have to be in the apps (win+A) and the extensions file had to be recognize. \n\nA: Here's my /usr/local/share/applications/processing.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Processing Development Environment\nExec=processing %F\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nIcon=pde\nCategories=Development;IDE\nMimeType=application/x-processing-sketch\n\nAssuming processing is in your $PATH.

This is simplified, of course, but so you can easily understand it. It's like the index in a lexicon or in a street map.\nBecause this table is so important (the drive has no other possibility to find out which data pieces belong to which file or where to look on the disk for a specific information), there is a mirrored copy of it. \nUsually they are always synchronized, but sometimes an error occurs (unplugging the stick too early without doing a save remove for example or a system crash during the write process) which causes differences in both tables. \nNow to eliminate them and get two correct and identical tables back, you have to run chkdsk /f from Windows, as the message already says. That is the easiest way, if you have access to a Windows machine. There are some NTFS-tools for Ubuntu too, but why should we take that effort if we can have an easy solution too?\nI hope this does help you to both solve your problem and understand what might have happened and how to avoid it in future. \n", "Q: Help With Dual Boot Ubuntu 14.1 and Windows 8.1 So here's my problem. I used YUMI from pendrivelinux.com, and I made a Ubuntu LiveCD. I tried manually and automatically partitioning, and I ran into many problems. After rebooting after installing (which went as smooth as can be as far as I can tell), all I get is a grub console/prompt, in which many commands don't seem to work. I know a common suggestion is to use boot-repair. But when I try to use it, it says that my PC is in Legacy mode, and I need it to be out of Legacy mode. However, I can't run my LiveCD when out of Legacy mode... So here is my problem. If anyone has any suggestions it would be much appreciated.\n\nA: First, the Ubuntu images, when burned to a CD-R, should boot in either BIOS or EFI mode. If by \"LiveCD\" you actually mean a USB flash drive, you can copy the Ubuntu images directly (as in sudo dd if=imagefile.iso of=/dev/sdc, changing the source and destination as necessary) and it should boot in either BIOS or EFI mode. You can do this from your legacy-mode boot, if necessary. As oldfred says, there are many other Windows and Linux utilities that will help you create a USB flash drive from an Ubuntu image, so even if the \"direct\" approach doesn't work or is impractical for you, you can try another tool.\nSecond, you can probably get your existing installation working as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from said image.\n\n*Boot rEFInd. (If you've not already done so, you'll need to disable Secure Boot.) It should show you a menu of boot options, including one or more Linux kernels.\n\n*Boot Ubuntu from rEFInd. If you used default Ubuntu options, it should boot right up. If you created a separate /boot partition, though, you'll need to hit F2 or Insert twice and add a root= option pointing to your root filesystem.\n\n*In Ubuntu, install any EFI boot loader for Linux that strikes your fancy. Two relatively easy options are:\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFInd by installing the Debian package or using the PPA referred to on the rEFInd downloads page. rEFInd will then become your default boot manager.\n\n*Install and run the Boot Repair utility, which should install the EFI version of GRUB over the BIOS version you may already have; or which will (with luck) fix whatever misconfiguration of the EFI version you might be suffering.\n\n\n\nA: The big mistake was trying to install OS in legacy mode. It have been said that it causes only more trouble. \nDon't use YUMI or your Live CD wouldn't work with UEFI properly. Use Rufus instead. \nI just updated this post. It might help you.\n", "Q: How to execute a number of lines using xargs I have a large sql dump that has 1 insert statement per line.

Instead, show us what the p and v commands reveal about the disk. You should also read the gdisk documentation on repairing GPT disks.\nThe gdisk output you've shown that is diagnostic is the first few lines, which suggest you've got a damaged main GPT header but damaged backup; but the (allegedly undamaged) main GPT data structures show ridiculous overlaps that suggest damage here, too. Without seeing the output from p and v, I can't be sure, but this suggests that the main GPT data may be corrupt. It might or might not be possible to fix this. It might also be worth loading the backup data to see what it resembles, as well as to examine the backup data.\nIn a worst-case scenario, it might be necessary to use TestDisk, as gedelat suggests; but you should hold this as a last-resort recovery method.\n\nA: @gadelat, rod smith: \"Hash of things\" means in that case by using testdisk: The things much mooore worse!\ntestdisk brings sometimes bad results in guessing parts (especially on disks which were used as Raid/LVM in the past)\ntry to use at first ALL IN TEST MODE (e.g. -n): \ngpart, fsck.ext3 -b <alternate super block> device\n\netc.\n\nA: Great tool for fixing this type of problem is utility testdisk.

The Ubuntu OpenStack Autopilot deploys an OpenStack cloud using Juju, MAAS and Landscape. It requires an existing MAAS server. How should I install and configure this server? What are its networking requirements, and how should the nodes be wired together?\n\nA: These are the networking requirements for a successful OpenStack Autopilot run.\nInternet access\nMAAS and its nodes will need to be able to reach the internet, or at least these sites (http and https):\n\n\n*\n\n*maas.ubuntu.com\n\n*cloud-images.ubuntu.com\n\n*streams.canonical.com\n\n*an Ubuntu archive (archive.ubuntu.com or a mirror)\n\n*api.jujucharms.com\n\n*manage.jujucharms.com\n\n*jujucharms.com\n\n*store.juju.ubuntu.com\n\n*keyserver.ubuntu.com\n\n*ppa.launchpad.net\n\n*usn.ubuntu.com\n\n\nIf opening holes in a firewall, be mindful that these addresses may resolve to multiple IPs.\nNetwork layout\nThere are two basic network layouts that we support. Let's call them \"flat network\" and \"split network\". In both these models, at least one node needs to have two network interfaces connected to networks that MAAS knows about. We will call them private and public networks.\nKeep in mind that OpenStack floating IPs will always come from the public network.\nIn the following diagrams, the \"cloud\" that is above the router does not necessarily mean the Internet directly, just that eventually devices on this network can reach the Internet.\nFlat network\nThe flat network model is the most basic one. Here we trick the system and simply say the public and private networks are the same and connect both NICs to it:\n\nOpenStack floating IPs will come from the same network as MAAS node IPs in this scenario.\nSplit network\nIn the split network topology, we have two actual distinct networks:\n\nMAAS only manages the private network, for which it will setup DNS and DHCP, but it has to know about the public one. An easy way to handle that automatically is to just hook up a second NIC to the MAAS machine and connect it to the public network as shown. MAAS will then automatically know about it.\nInstalling MAAS\nThis is how the MAAS server should be installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS on the machine you want to use for MAAS\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maas-maintainers/stable\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install maas\n\n*Access the MAAS UI at http://maas.ip/MAAS/ and follow the instructions to create the administrator, then login with those credentials\n\n*Import disk images for 14.04 LTS (Trusty) 64 bits. This will take a few minutes, depending on your bandwidth.\n\n*Add your SSH key to your user profile - http://maas.ip/MAAS/account/prefs/\n\n*Go to the Networks tab in MAAS and verify that you have auto-created networks for each NIC of your MAAS server. You may have networks created for virtual interfaces like lxcbr0 or virbr0: we don't care about those, only about real physical interfaces.\n\n*Fill in the missing details, like gateway and DNS, in the networks that were auto-created for each NIC\n\n\nConfiguring the MAAS cluster\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the \"Clusters\" tab and then click on your cluster\n\n*Choose a DNS zone name\n\n*You should see a list of NICs on the machine. Click the edit symbol for the NIC that's connected to the private network, that is, the network where all the nodes are\n\n*Set this NIC to manage DHCP and DNS.\n\n*If needed, configure the IP, subnet mask, broadcast IP.\n\n*Set the \"Router IP\" to the default gateway for this private network\n\n*Carve up your network space into ranges like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*for the split network case: dynamic range and static range\n\n*for the flat network case: dynamic range, static range and floating IP range\nWhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*dynamic range: used by all the NICs in the nodes while they enlist and commission.\n\n*static range: used by nodes when they are allocated to a user\n\n*floating IP range: used by OpenStack floating IPs. This is not a MAAS configuration, but you should leave room for them\n\n\nSave the changes.\nEnlist and commission machines\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure all other machines are set to PXE boot, if possible disable all other boot options (including local disk) in the BIOS\n\n*Enlist the machines by powering them on. This can usually be done by some sort of virtual console. Eventually they will all appear in the node list in MAAS and be powered down again.\n\n*Edit each machine in the nodes list and fill in the Power type and power parameters so that MAAS can turn them on and off as needed\n\n*Select all of the machines and, using the Bulk action dropdown, Commission them\n\n*Wait until all machines are commissioned (i.e. in Ready state)\n\n\nMAAS networks\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Networks tab and verify that you have the nodes listed in what is your private network and with their respective NICs selected\n\n*If using the flat network topology, the node that has two NICs should have been automatically detected as having both NICs connected to the network. Just verify that this is the case.\n\n*If using the split network topology, edit the public network and look for the node that has two NICs. Select the NIC that is connected to the public network.\n\n\nTesting things\nTo make sure juju can drive MAAS and provision machines, let's take it for a spin. It's best to try it out now and fix any issues before more complex services like the Autopilot make use of it.\nOn the machine being used to drive the installation, run these commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:juju/stable\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install juju-core juju-deployer\n\n*Follow Juju docs for configuring MAAS\nThe remainder of this document will assume that the MAAS Juju environment you just configured is the default one.\nFor a simple test, we will deploy Ubuntu to all nodes. On the machine that is driving the installation, run these commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*juju bootstrap this will use one of the MAAS nodes to bootstrap juju. It will take a few minutes to complete\n\n*juju deploy ubuntu -n N deploy ubuntu to all remaining nodes. Replace N with the number of nodes minus one, which was used for the bootstrap above. This command returns after a few seconds, but it just starts the process.\n\n*watch the nodes list in the MAAS UI. You should see nodes being allocated and deployed\n\n*watch the output of juju status periodically until everything is started\n\n*login into a random node via ssh and try to reach the internet from it. For example, try juju ssh ubuntu/0 and wget http://www.ubuntu.com from there\n\n*if everything worked correctly, destroy the environment juju destroy-environment $(juju env)\nMAAS is setup and ready to be used by the OpenStack Autopilot.\n", "Q: Fresh install of Ubuntu with i3wm I would like to use the i3 Window Manager with Ubuntu and not Unity.\nSince I am going to do a fresh install Id like to keep the bloat to a minimum. \nShould I just install it normally with the Desktop version and  remove Unity and compiz or install the Server version and then install X and i3? \nIs it the same or are there any things I should be wary of?\n\nA: I also like to keep bloat to a minimum, and I personally prefer to start from a fresh Ubuntu Server install.\nAfter installation, add the i3 PPA, and then execute:\nsudo apt install i3\n\nWanting to have a fall-back environment, one could consider to install for example Xfce (just the core package), that would still keep bloat to a minimum:\nsudo apt install xfce4\n\nNote: This will not include a login manager. It may be seen as an advantage for people preferring to start from CLI\n\nA: To keep the system bloat to absolute minimum You can use Ubuntu MinimalCD. You can download it here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\n\nAfter installing only a base system (it requires an internet connection), issue the following commands to install i3 and xinit (it is required for startx to work) :\nsudo apt install i3\n\nAnd then\nsudo apt install xinit\n\nYou can reboot now and after loggin in as user just run command:\nstartx\n\nEnjoy Your minimal i3 ubuntu installation.\n\nA: I've been using i3wm for the past few days on Kubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (Ubuntu derivative), and it's a bit different of an experience.\nSince Ubuntu uses the LightDM Display Manager, you can install i3wm and give it a try alongside your current window manager.\nJust install the proper packages using the following in your shell:\nsudo apt-get install i3\n\nNote that Ubuntu uses an older version of i3, due to the process that Ubuntu uses to upstream new packages to their repositories. You can also follow the instructions found here from the i3wm site, to use the latest stable version.\nOnce you have i3 installed, just log out to your display manager which is what handles your login & starts your window manager. Click the window manager box & change it to i3, and login. You should now be in i3wm, and a prompt will come up to generate your configuration file & ask you which modifier key you want to use (Alt or Super).\nSome basic keybinds to help you with your first usage:\nMod+Enter            # Starts a terminal session\nMod+d                # Brings up dmenu, which finds commands from your $PATH\nMod+Shift+e          # Prompt to exit i3wm\n\nYour config file will be in .i3/config, and has a list of all keybindings. It's quite configurable, I have mine set so that mod+b brings up my web browser, and mod+m brings up steam. I also bound my windows switching directional keys to hjkl rather than jkl;to match vim keybindings that I use in every other program that I can use them in, and just rebound horizontal split to mod+shift+v.\nYou can also add things to your .i3/config that you want to run at startup, by using exec on it's own without a preceding bindsym. For example, I put this line in my .i3/config to change my background:\nexec_always --no-startup-id feh --bg-scale ~/pictures/Backgrounds/background01.jpg\n\nI also added in some others, like exec --no-startup-id volumeicon and exec --no-startup-id nm-applet for tray icons, for an ALSA volume icon & a network manager.\nOne thing that's a bit different is my updating process, I'm not running an update notifier so after I run updates via the command line, I run the following script to check whether or not the file /var/run/reboot-required exists:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ]; then\n    echo 'A system restart is required.'\nfi\n\nA thing I like about i3wm is that I'm starting to use the command line a lot more, and learning a lot along the way. I recommend keeping Unity as a fallback, just in case you decide to go back.\nThe User's Guide on the i3wm website is very helpful, and should help you in getting started with further configuration to your .i3/config.\n", "Q: Where is the Ubuntu cursor, in the source code? I'm trying (and failing) to sift through the source, attempting to find the image file(s) for the default cursor. Does anyone know where this is?\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you are looking for the cursor you have in graphic applications. \nThe cursor is not just an image; there is a whole \"cursor theme\" involved (it changes when selecting, writing text, etc.!). So the location of the files are theme-dependent. \nIn my Ubuntu Gnome the default cursor theme (you can check it with gnome-tweak-tool) is called Adwaita; searching for it with \n locate -i adwaita | grep -i cursor\n\npoints to /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/cursors. The files there are not simple graphic files, but X11 cursor files, whose manipulation is explained in this question: Opening cursor files in a graphics editor? \nunity-tweak-tool will point you to the correct site if you have Unity. \nYou can also check this Q&A: How to change mouse cursor and theme?.\nIn my standard gimp installation in Ubuntu I can simply open it; see: \n% gimp left_ptr\n\n\nas you can see, is a multi-layer image with the cursor for different size.

I am not sure the difference.  They are all set to get their time \"Automatically from the Internet\" and are on the same time zone.  How do I get the laptop to update and continue to stay in sync using the Internet?\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS, 64-bit version.\nEDIT:\nAll three dual-boot Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7 though I have not booted any of them in Windows in several weeks/months.  I set these machines up several months ago so I am not certain but I intended that they all be set to use UTC time (following this link to make sure Windows cooperates).  I just opened /etc/default/rcS on the laptop and one of the desktops and they both have UTC=no set so that seems not to be the case.  Looking at the system time on the laptop I get:\n>>> sudo hwclock --show\nWed 11 Mar 2015 06:33:13 AM EDT  -0.188065 seconds\n\nwhile for one of the desktops I get:\n>>> sudo hwclock --show\nWed 11 Mar 2015 11:32:56 AM EDT  -0.219271 seconds\n\nand it is just after 11:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM UTC) as I type this.  Comparing those results, it seems the the desktop is on local time while I don't know what the laptop is on as EST = UTC - 5 and EDT = UTC - 4.\nHow would I update each system to in fact be on UTC time (I intend to follow this to make sure Windows does not change things)?\n\nA: See if you have a file /etc/ntp.conf, then see if this file contains line starting with the keyword 'server' (without the quotes of course). If you have this then the time will be regularly synchronized with timeservers.\nIf you do not have this file then no time keeping service is installed. To install ntpd, from a terminal prompt enter:\nsudo apt-get install ntp\n\nThat is about it in a nutshell. If you do not have this file or if you are not sure what about what you are doing please refer to this resource: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html. It contains more useful information than I can explain here. Although it is about servers it works equally good for desktops and laptops.\nTo modify the systems to use UTC time, edit /etc/default/rcS (e.g. sudo emacs /etc/default/rcS) setting UTC=yes.\n\nA: From response #7 on this post I found that I could run the command sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org which would force the machine to sync the time.  This seems to have corrected the time displayed but I am not sure the effect on the system time or if it will remain after rebooting.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 not detecting allocated partition on windows 8.1 laptop I've  brought new Lenovo Z5070 laptop with preinstalled FreeDOS.

What is even worse, is that Chrome still thinks the window is positioned correctly, so that the mouse pointer is always ever-so-slightly off (you can see that in the GIF too, pay attention to the hover-status of the back-button).\nI think the issue might be similar to the bug described here and here, although there is no mention of the visible offset there. I tried all the fixes suggested in these posts, none of them worked for me.\nThis is really getting on my nerves, I have a dual monitor setup and I frequently move windows from one monitor to the other, which also makes this bug appear (window is unmaximized and then maximized on the other monitor).

On Linux the background Chrome seems to only stay in memory if an extension expressly requests a background presence.  This occurs even when you specify the --no-startup-window command line switch.\nIf you specify the switch and an extension which requests a background presence is not installed, Chrome loads and then exits as there is no window open.  This behavior can be solved by adding an extension to Chrome that specifically requests to be run in the background.  The Hangouts extension is a good example of this.\nI do not personally run the Hangouts extension, but I found a little, unobtrusive timer extension that fills the need to have an extension specifically request to run in the background, called countDown.\n", "Q: cannot move all files at once I am trying to move files inside one folder to another folder.

As far as I know all you can do in ubuntu or any linux, is split the screen. Even then you can only split the windows...this can be done by clicking and dragging a window, to the far right or left of the screen. What this will do is maximize the window on half of the screen. You can also do the same by running [ctrl] + [super], then using the up left and right arrow keys...Now i'm not sure why you would want to \ntrisect your screen, as it would make the windows harder to read or see...But if you want you can adjust the size of the windows, and throw one in the middle...Now keep in mind you do have multiple workspaces in Linux, and if you dont you'll have to enable them. to do this simply go into your system settings, and inside of the behavior settings for the appearance you want to click enable work spaces. and that will give you some more space to work arround with.

And, in this case, what are, in your opinion the best apps?\nThank you in advance for your advices!\n\nA: There is a command for that: icotool and it is part of icoutils\n\nThe  icotool program converts and creates icon (.ico) and cursor (.cur)\n     files. At the moment icons can only be created from and extracted  into\n     PNG files. This is done using libpng.\nIcon  and  cursor  files  are  used  mainly on the Microsoft Windows(R)\n     platform. Each icons or cursors file may  contain  multiple  images  of\n     various  resolutions  and with different number of colors. Cursor files\n     differ from icon files in that they also contain information about  the\n     hotspot of each image.\nRecent  versions  of  Microsoft's Internet Explorer use icons for small\n     site logotypes. The browser fetches a file called  favicon.ico  from  a\n     web  site,  and  uses  the images in this file to represent the site in\n     menus and site lists. (This file is  placed  in  the  web  site's  root\n     directory,  like any other file.) Browsers like Galeon have copied this\n     behaviour and now also  fetches  .ico  files  and  use  them  for  site\n     logotypes.\nAs  each  icon or cursor file may contains multiple images of different\n     dimensions and depth, a conversion may result  in  multiple  PNG  files\n     being  created.  Correspondingly,  multiple  PNG files can be specified\n     when creating an icon/cursor file.\n\n\nA: Install icoutils by executing following in terminal :\nsudo apt-get install icoutils\n\nAnd then use icotool\nExecute man icotool for manual\n", "Q: Passthrough AMD GPU to virtual machine without using second GPU I read some topics about passing GPU to virtual machine, but that examples requires an two GPU's (one for VM and one for host OS).

I know that this is probably a relatively pointless question, but I am curious as to why exec false closes the terminal just like exit does. \nI would also like to know if this is a acceptable way to close the terminal or not.\n\nA: exec false is replacing the current shell by the execution of the command false (here not the shell builtin but /bin/false or whatever false executable that comes first in the PATH) which quickly exits. If the shell was the topmost process running in your terminal emulator, there are no more processes running inside it so the terminal emulator is closed.\nThis is a an acceptable alternate way to close a terminal, just like would be many similar commands:\nexec true\nexec sleep 0\nexec echo\n...\n\nSee also: what-does-an-exec-command-do\n", "Q: Font displaying as squares in terminal preview I have recently installed inconsolata and now when I go to preview the font it shows up as squares.\n\nThis is a preview form my terminal.\nHere are my file permissions:\n> ls -lh /usr/share/fonts/truetype/inconsolata\ntotal 60K\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 58K Dec  6  2009 Inconsolata.otf\n\nand here is where it is located (truetype fonts folder):\n> ls -lh /usr/share/fonts/truetype            \ntotal 96K\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 abyssinica\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 dejavu\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Nov 17 22:43 droid\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   43 Nov 17 22:09 fonts-japanese-gothic.ttf -> /       /etc/alternatives/fonts-japanese-gothic.ttf\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 freefont\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Feb 18 15:20 horai-umefont\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Mar  8 18:01 inconsolata\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 kacst\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 kacst-one\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 lao\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 liberation\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Feb 18 15:23 msttcorefonts\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 nanum\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Dec 19 10:11 openoffice\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 padauk\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 sinhala\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 takao-gothic\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 tibetan-machine\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 tlwg\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 ttf-indic-fonts-core\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 ttf-khmeros-core\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 ttf-punjabi-fonts\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Jul 22  2014 ubuntu-font-family\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Feb 18 15:20 unfonts-core\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Feb 18 15:21 wqy\n\nCan anyone help me?

Obviously, running Deja-Dup as my user fails to touch it.\nI configured Deja-Dup from system settings, and I found no option that would help me tackle this there. Any ideas? Or do I go to duplicity and run it from cron? If so, where can I see what exact calls to duplicity are made from Deja-Dup (is there anything clearer than setting a debug flag as in DEJA_DUP_DEBUG=1 deja-dup --backup and hunting for calls in wall-of-text that follows)?\nI would like to avoid changing the permissions to my user, if possible (I believe etckeeper folks did this under root:root for a reason).\n\nA: It's fine to include such directories in a backup as long as your user can READ the files (users can often, but not always, read root-owned files).\nBut if your user can't read the files, I recommend running duplicity directly via cron. Deja Dup is designed for users, not system administrators.\n", "Q: How do I get support for a DELL Ubuntu laptop? Hopefully this experience will improve with DELL. I have a DELL M3800 Precision Workstation Laptop factory installed with Ubuntu.\nWhen calling into DELL technical support (1-800-999-3355), when I tell them I need assistance with the DELL factory installed applications on my factory Ubuntu Linux laptop (basically any software problem) I get interesting answers like...\n\n\n*\n\n*We only support Windows\n\n*You need to contact Canonical\n\n*Call this number 1-866-982-8688 (which will not help)\n\n\nHow can I get technical support (which I paid for!) for my DELL Ubuntu laptop?\nI am answering my own question below after a frustrating experience that took hours...\n\nA: TL;DR\nCall the \"workstation group\". They have a direct line 1-877-671-3355 and are knowledgeable about the Ubuntu laptops that DELL sells.\nThey will help you directly if you have a hardware issue. If it is a software issue, they will open a ticket with special support that (I was told) has no direct line and they will call you back directly.\nDon't call 1-800-999-3355 for Ubuntu laptops\nEvery time I call them, I get asked to call 1-866-982-8688. This number gives 2 options - to be connected with Ubuntu Advantage (which owning a DELL laptop does not entitle you to) or DELL DataSafe. Selecting DataSafe instructs you to call 1-877-218-1671. The techs there cannot support DELL laptops and will redirect you. I tried explaining this to the technicians at 1-800-999-3355, but they continued to insist I call the 1-866-982-8688 number.\nUPDATE: I recently just called the 1-877-671-3355 and was instructed to call the 8688 number again. If DELL suggests that you call that number, inform them that it doesn't work. Hopefully they can look into this and get it sorted out internally.\nUPDATE AGAIN: After much difficulty with DELL regarding Linux support, I remain very skeptical that the technicians or representative I speak to can accurately represent the Linux experience with DELL. For example, they may tell you that you can do something (such as use a DELL diagnostic tool or recommend updating drivers) with Windows, that simply isn't possible or sensical using Linux. I am very disappointed with this experience from DELL. I would not recommend it. DELL has technicians capable of supporting Linux, but chances are you wont get to speak with them or replies will be significantly delayed.\nBe careful when speaking with DELL's sales especially.\n", "Q: Ubuntu install crashes using Live-USB made in Win7 I'm having some troubles installing Ubuntu from a Live-USB, it keeps crashing duing installation.\nHere is some back ground information:\nMy current PC has Win7 installed and that is what I'm using to build the Live-USB with according to the Ubuntu docs.\nI'm using ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso which I downloaded yesterday and I've also tried using ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso, which I already had and have used as a VM too.\nPC Specs\n\n\n*\n\n*OS: Win 7 Professional 64-bit\n\n*CPU: i7-2600 @ 3.4ghz\n\n*MB: ASUS P8P67-M-PRO\n\n*RAM: Corsair DDR3 8GB\n\n*SSD: Samsung 850 EVO, OCZ 120\n\n*HHD: 2 TB, 1TB\n\n*GPU: EVGA GTX 580 3GB\n\n*PSU: TR2 Bronze 700W\n\n\nProblem breakdown:\nSo my plan is to have my PC duel boot with either Win7 or Ubuntu.

Using the live-USB I was hoping on installing it and have my PC ask which OS to boot on start up and go from there. Sadly this obliviously did not occur. I'll list my step taken below.\nStep by step:\nFirstly as said above I use a live usb which I made as per the Ubuntu docs. I then shutdown and re-booted, pressed F8 and within the boot menu select the USB (both UEFI and standard BIOS are options, both didn't work) once the menu appears, I select \"Install Ubuntu\" (I've seen on other posts that selecting Try Ubuntu then instal from there would work but it didn't.)\nOriginally I would see this LINK. \nI did a \"disk check\" and found that there was 2 errors in my files. (Thanks error, ever so descriptive.)\nAlthough after using a different USB builder this appears as blank now. (unetbootin-windows-608.exe)\nThen after I would find myself at the Ubuntu loading screen and follow the steps to build my PC. (I've tried both custom and standard installs, I've noticed that Ubuntu can tell that the last Ubuntu I attempted to install is there, as it says that there is one present and appears on the disk list, even though it failed)\n\n\n*\n\n*Select my 1TB HHD\n\n*I would partition 20GB for swap (I've now chosen to only have 10GB)\n\n*Then select the rest as Ext4 and as the mount point '/'\n\n*Enter the OS' details then install\n\n\nAfter about 10-20mins later I'm then greeted by \"Installer Crashed\" and after pressing close I'm told \"the system log from your installation contains an error.\"\nI'm really at a loss, I've got no idea why this is so finicky.\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. I hope I've made this as detailed as possible, any other information you may need I'm happy to supply. (I did have more photos but I can't link them. :) )\nThanks,\nMichael\n\nA: I found that after doing some checks while in the test Ubuntu that the drive that it was being installed on had a number of I/O errors that of course not fixable and means the drive is on its way out.

I would like to build a biarch Wine on my 64 bits laptop. But reading all the pages of the WineHQ project on such a configuration, I found a page about gcc version (written in May 2013), explaining that gcc version to be used, should be 4.5. Using Ubuntu 14.04, the gcc version I currently have is 4.8 (\"known to not work\" to build Wine, according to Wine pages). I tried to install gcc 4.5.3 on my laptop, but so far I haven't managed.\nShould I persist in installing gcc 4.5, or is it now unnecessary? 4.8 would be OK?\n\nA: Actually I got an answer from a Wine developer.

I just created a bootable USB on Mac using ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso. It works. But I have two issues with it:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are two partitions titled \"efi\" appeared when booting from the USB flash drive, instead of one. I can boot into Ubuntu from both partitions. Upon inspection, one is called “bootx64.efi”, another “grubx64.efi”. \n\n*My wireless network doesn't work on Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS amd64. I am running it live from USB drive. It will only use plug-in Ethernet.\nMy laptop: MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012), MacBookPro9,2, MD101LL/A, 13.3\"/2.5 i5/2x4GB/500-5400, Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite\nUSB drive: UFD 3.0 Silicon-Power 16G USB device (it has U3 software on it before format) formatted with “Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and GUID, one partition only”.\nOn Macbook Pro 13 Mid-2012 i5 2.5Hz, since wireless not working, I issued a lspci command on Mac and got response as follows:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ lspci –nm | grep 0280\n\n02:00.0 “0280” “14e4” “4331” –r02 “1066” “00f5”\n\nI then booted this Ubuntu USB on my Windows 7 PC Lenovo ThinkPad T410 i5 2.4GHz (2010) with legacy BIOS/MBR. It is bootable as well, wow! And the wireless works flawlessly. I also issued lspci as follows:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ lspci –nm | grep 0280\n\n03:00.0 “0280” “8086” “4239” –r35 “8086” “1311”\n\nIn response to Jeremy31's answer, I booted Ubuntu 14.04.2 again off the live USB on my MacBook Pro9.2 without installation. The wireless had no reaction as it was. I then used an Ethernet cable direct connecting my Mac to my modem. It connected the Ubuntu to the internet fine through wired connection.  \nI typed the command you suggested: sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer. But it gave out an error message: E: Unable to locate package firmware-b43-installer. \nI never get to your modprobe command of course.\nJeremy31,\nI did sudo apt-get update using wired connection without any issue. I then issued sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer. I still gave out the same error: E: Unable to locate package firmware-b43-installer. \nAny other trick?  \nThanks, Josh \n\nA: The Mac will likely only be able to use wifi after installing to a drive and using sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer and rebooting.  You could try the same command using the Live version along with sudo modprobe -r b43 followed by sudo modprobe b43 but it usually hangs\nBurning the ISO to a USB drive is different than installing it.  If I misunderstood your post, I apologize \nThe Live version works with the Lenovo because it has an Intel wifi card and Ubuntu is able to distribute the firmware with the install disk and not need a seperate download like the Mac needs with the Broadcom wifi\nEDIT: Since the normal install method isn't working correctly, download https://www.dropbox.com/s/7exlzch25ap6uha/b43.zip?dl=0 and extract it to your home folder, then\nsudo mkdir /lib/firmware/b43\nsudo mv b43 /lib/firmware\n\nreboot\n", "Q: How the heck do I make jar files executable?

I am currently dual booting Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04. My hard drive is split into two partitions: one containing windows (~350 GB) and one containing Ubuntu (~150 GB), in that order. I would like to shrink my windows partition and expand my Ubuntu partition. However, this would require shrinking the end of my windows partition and then expanding the beginning of my Ubuntu partition. I'm a fairly new user to Ubuntu/Linux (long time Windows user) and I recall reading before that moving the beginning of a windows partition is dangerous and shouldn't be done. Does this hold true for Linux/Ubuntu or should I be fine?\n\nA: Everything in a partition is identified relative to the start point of the partition. Thus, moving the start of a partition will most likely involve modifying more data in the partition than moving the end point of a partition. The more data you modify, the greater the risk of an error creeping in because of a bug, an I/O error, a power failure, etc. Note that the data being moved is filesystem data structures, which are unusually sensitive -- if a bit gets flipped in, say, an MP3 file that you're copying, you might hear a glitch in playback for one file; but if a bit gets flipped in a critical filesystem data structure, you could lose access to a whole file, a whole directory tree, or even the entire filesystem. Thus, if at all possible, you should avoid moving the start point of a partition.\nThat said, partition moves involving the start point of a partition usually succeed just fine; I just wouldn't go so far as to describe them as being safe.\nNote that the extra concern with Windows partitions is a result of BIOS-mode boot loader code. As MoonSweep says, GRUB doesn't work the same way and so Linux partitions aren't as susceptible to these problems. Furthermore, EFI-mode boot loaders for Windows also don't rely as much on absolute partition locations, so you're more likely to get away with such moves of NTFS if the computer boots using EFI than if it boots using BIOS.\n\nA: It should be fine. AFAIK, unlike Windows bootloader, Grub (you did install it in the MBR, right ?) doesn't rely on some record of the starting position of a partition to find it, but it uses its ordering on the disk (example: \"third partition on the first disk\"). That's how it finds its menu files, splash screen, etc (look at /boot/grub/grub.cfg), so as long as you don't change the partitions order it should work. Nevertheless, always backup your important files before touching the partitions !\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK - Example clocks wont run in emulator I'm trying to start the example \"clocks\" from the ubuntu SDK in the phone emulator.

It might be a little easier if you were to use a GUI LVM tool such as system-config-lvm, shown here:\n\nThis particular example shows that my volume group consists of two physical volumes (/dev/sda5 and /dev/sdb5), which are combined together and then split up again into nine logical volumes. The image in the center shows there's a significant amount of unused space. I can create new logical volumes at will, without resizing or moving existing logical volumes. If I were to delete one of the existing logical volumes, there would be no gap in the display; anything to the right of the deleted logical volume would be moved to the left. (On the disks, the data would not move; the LVM would just keep track of where the gaps are and create new logical volumes in the available space, no matter where it is.)\nIn your specific case, you should verify that you have some free space. You can use system-config-lvm (it's in the Ubuntu repositories) or the underlying text-mode tools like vgdisplay. If you don't have space in your LVM, you'll need to add disk space, delete an unwanted logical volume, or shrink one or more logical volumes. Once you've got some free space, use system-config-lvm or the text-mode lvcreate to create a new logical volume for your new installation.\nThe likely trouble spot is that you'll also probably need a partition (outside of the LVM) to use as /boot for the new OS, and that could get tricky if you didn't plan for this when you set up your computer. (In theory, GRUB can load kernels from within an LVM, but I've never tried this myself and I've not seen documentation on how to do it.) With any luck you'll have something big enough that you can shrink to make room. You'll need to use traditional partitioning tools, like GParted, to handle this part of the task. Alternatively, if you add a disk to make room in your volume group, you can set it up with your new /boot partition, too. (I'd create another one or two for future use while I'm at it.)\n", "Q: I Had a Backdoor Mal Ware on W7. Will it Pass on to Ubuntu? October 15, 2014, I got hit with a team of revenge hackers. They are working for my ex-father-in-law. He has been proxy stalking me since 2004 but since that has no effect on me anymore, he decided to hire a team of Pro Hackers. \nWhen I say Pro, I mean just exactly like that. When they first hit me, they disabled my firewall. They disabled any type of AV/FW including: Comodo, Kapersky, System Mechanic Pro and Norton.\nI had a key scrambler and they disabled that. I had an Anti Keylogger and they disabled that.\nThough they cannot hit me as hard as when running W7, I know that as I type every single word, they are watching it in real time and I've only been up and running with Ubuntu, but I'm sure they will find a way to disable that as well.\nTheir only purpose that I can tell is to monitor me and and keep me off the web. I have on occasion, found some of their hidden files and they talk about keeping tabs for the amount of time each hacker spends so they can get paid.\nFrankly, I don't know how my ex father-in-law affords it b/c I fight with them daily. When I say daily, I mean 8-12 hours per day. Another reason I know that it is a team is that I've tried going all day w/o logging in to my PC and I'll wait till about 3:30AM and try to sneak past them, but they must have an alarm b/c w/in minutes they are back in my system, doing redirects and such. \nNow here is the crazy part: After I installed W7, I never connected to the Net until I felt like my system was hardened. However, I'll have all my FW rules in place and then work on which services to block and then take a look at my FW again, and low and behold, they have changed my FW Rules and I am not even connected to the Net.\nHow do they do that? I was not tethered in nor was I using WIFI. As a matter of fact, I had yet to enable WIFI. So that just blows my mind away! But then after finding other files where they are communicating back and forth, they have stuff in there like:\nEnable FM Radio\nEnable Ham Radio\nEnable Blur Tooth\nEnable TV\nI kinda had a feeling like they were some how or another using radio waves to transmit script and the only way I could stop that was to unplug my PC and take the battery out. Either that, or I would wake up and my PC was not the way I left it, it was set to their \npreferences.\n---------->Can anyone explain that to me?<------------------\nOnce they get a foot in the door, they start executing more scripts and become the SUPER USER and lock me out of programs that I paid for. \nI have installed and re-installed Windows over 40 times since October. However, I noticed that every-time I use a Linux based system, they have harder time messing with me. But they have someway or another gained access to my laptop which has the latest version of Ubuntu. The reason I know that they have gained access is that when I was trying to install the latest firewall. (I can't think of the name but it's the one with the shield on it.) As soon as they saw that I was typing in the word \"Firewall\" they disabled it from the Ubuntu Software Updater. I had to go online and search for it, but instead of downloading it from their site, they demonstrated how it could be installed by using Terminal. I did that, and they could not stop me from doing that. \nA lot of people claim that **nix systems are almost hack proof, but that is far from the truth! Even when I've installed Ubuntu just to grab some files for Windows, I would reformat the HD then do a AV/MW check and sure enough there was  Mal Ware in the MBR. The problem is that Comodo does not identify this type of mal ware. It just has an image on the screen and then it allows you to quarantine it. This happens on Windows 7 and Ubuntu. \nSo the problem is that there is no virus but somewhere in the boot-sector, they have written \"self propagation code\" THAT EXECUTES AS SOON AS THE DATA BEGINS TO TRANSFER FROM DVD TO THE HD. \nHow would code that is meant for Windows execute on Ubuntu?\nI have spent hundreds of dollars reading books bought from Barnes and Noble as well as paid $300 to have both of my laptops fixed. But all the tech did was flashed the BIOS.\nBut the PC I'm on now will not let me flash BIOS anymore. I guess they wrote new script to prohibit flashing the BIOS.\nI'm raising money to have a Forensic specialist who has a background in law enforcement, but that will cost me $2.5K and the only way to raise the money (I'm on disability) will be to stand at a busy intersection and panhandle. Not the way bums do, I'll have all my receipts and my drop slip from school. I was working on a degree in web design and the hackers hit me half the way through the class and I had to drop b/c of this. I'll also have a copy of a police report that I filed and simply pass out folders with all that info w/ a self addressed envelope complete with a stamp to send funds to a trust account. That way I can pay the forensic specialist and hire an attorney. He said that it would take about three days to do it. All he has to do is place a wire tap and he said for sure that he will catch them, locate them and all I have to do is prosecute them and sue them for damages and lost wages.\nI have two websites that I maintain, but can't because I do not want these nitwits to get my password and crash my website. And since I have no fresh content since August 2014, Google has penalized me and I continue to slowly fall from page one of Google for any search term related to my website to page 5 or even lower and some pages that were ranking well, just do not come up in the SERP's anymore.\nBut back to the problem, how does a program written for W7 transfer to Ubuntu? And that problem is through a back door that they have set up.\nI would appreciate any comments on this issue. I'm just now learning Ubuntu and it's fun to play with, but I need to run programs that are not compatible for any Linux off spin.\nSo until I can get that wiretap on my pc, what can I do?\nRegards,\ndj\n\nA: Most Malware that runs within the OS is built for Windows and are in .exe binaries. They physically cannot run on a Linux machine unless they are packaged for Linux machines (.rpm/.deb).\nThat is not to say viruses don't exist for Linux. Here are a few dating as far back as 1996. Linux's fast updates also pretty quickly patch vulnerabilities, and there has never been a widespread attack on Linux with a program like CryptoLocker.\nIf Malware has gotten into the MBR record of your hard drive, use a new one. Buy a fresh new one, and do not connect it to the old one, no questions asked. If it'd be easier for you, get a whole new computer and just load Ubuntu on it from the get-go.\nAnd you're right about it being harder for \"them\" to mess with you on Ubuntu, that's because root access works differently in Linux than in Windows. It'll be easy for you to prevent yourself from getting any of the few Linux viruses on Ubuntu if you're smart, i.e. knowing when not to use root.\nSimply, Windows programs cannot be natively run on Linux, no questions asked. You need a program like Wine that can execute the binaries, and even then, I believe those programs are somewhat sandboxed. Linux malware is out there, but is far from common and likely will not give you a headache.\nSome further reading on Linux malware.\n", "Q: Why can't I mount an f2fs partition on a HDD?

When you run set without arguments, it prints every variable set in the current shell. From the POSIX specification:\n\nIf no options or arguments are specified, set shall write the names and values of all shell variables in the collation sequence of the current locale.\n\nThis will throw off your calculation, since this does not set the arguments to the empty list - you'll be adding the previous line's word count again.\nYou're getting that output because $line is empty, so what you should do is check if it is, in fact, empty:\nwhile read line\ndo\n    nol=`expr $nol + 1`\n    if [ -n \"$line\" ]\n    then\n        set $line\n        now=`expr $now + $#`\n    fi\ndone\n\n\nAside from that, instead of exec <$f, I'd suggest using:\nwhile read ..\ndo \n    ...\ndone < \"$f\"\n\nWhat your doing now is:\nterminal=`tty`\nexec < $f    \n...\nexec < $terminal\n\nYou are redirecting the whole script, whereas you only need the redirection for the loop. You can skip the call to tty and the two execs:\nif [ -s $f ]\nthen\n    nol=0\n    now=0\n\n    while read line\n    do\n        ...\n    done < \"$f\"\n    ...\nfi\n\n\nAnd use arithmetic expansion instead of command substitution with expr:\nnol=$((nol + 1))\nnow=$((now + $#))\n\n\nAnd always, always, quote  your variables unless you explicitly want splitting:\n\n\n*\n\n*[ -s \"$f\" ]\n\n*exec < \"$f\"\nConsider what happens when f contains spaces:\nf=\"there are spaces in this filename\"\n[ -s $f ]\nexec < $f\n\nYou'll get errors, because once $f is replaced by its contents, each word in it will be seen separately:\nbash: [: too many arguments\nbash: $f: ambiguous redirect\n\n", "Q: How can I remotely access the desktop of my Ubuntu server? I would like to access the desktop of one of my Ubuntu servers over the  internet from my Windows laptop. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 8.\nSorry for this generic questions as I have been trying for last couple days with some related links, but I'm yet to find proper solution.\nHow can I remotely access the desktop of my Ubuntu server?\n\nA: Since the Ubuntu server installation does not install the X-environment by default, there would be no desktop to connect to. Unless you installed X manually, what you need is a way to access the console/command line, seeing as most of what you do in a linux server is done via the console anyway =)\n- SSH Client\nThe easiest way to access the console is using a ssh client for windows called PuTTy (available at putty.org).\nMy preferred method is to install openssh for windows (download at openssh.org). This means you can connect to a server by opening a DOS window and type \"ssh\" just like you would at the console in linux.\n- SSH Server\nTo verify that the ssh server is running on the server, enter the following on the server console:\nsudo service ssh status\nIf it's running you will get a message back saying that the service is running and a number indicating the process id.\nIf you get an error message, the ssh server might not be installed. Try the following to install the ssh server:\nsudo apt-get install ssh\nThis will install the ssh-server and start it. Now you should be able to connect through ssh using putty.\n- Bonus\nInstalling/using ssh to connect to the server gives the extra bonus of being able to use a windows program called winscp (download at winscp.net), It's a windows implementation of \"scp\" and allows you to download/upload files to the server in a FTP-like way.\n\nA: It sounds like you want to set up VNC. One way to try is with TightVNC. Here are instructions for Ubuntu 10.10. \nAnother option to look into would be Vino, which now comes with Ubuntu by default (I'm not sure about 12.04).\n", "Q: Is it possible to limit cache memory to a process? I am using network capture tool named dumpcap and it is consuming too much cache memory.\nSo other processes getting no memory to run.\nhtop command shown cache memory as 29 GB in Meters.  \nCan anyone help to get a solution for this ?\n\nA: There is no problem, so you do not need to do anything.\nThe question is misunderstanding how system cache works.  System cache does not occupy memory thereby preventing it being used by processes.  It only occupies available memory.  Once that memory is no longer available because a process has allocated it, it will no longer be used by the system cache.\nThe below is an edited form of an answer I made to a different question:\nHow Linux uses RAM (very simplified)\nEach application can use some of your memory.  Linux uses all otherwise unoccupied memory (except for the last few Mb) as \"cache\".  This includes the page cache, inode caches, etc.  This is a good thing - it helps speed things up heaps.  Both writing to disk and reading from disk can be sped up immensely by cache.\nIdeally, you have enough memory for all your applications, and you still have several hundred Mb left for cache.  In this situation, as long as your applications don't increase their memory use and the system isn't putting too much pressure on the cache, there is no need for any swap.\nOnce applications claim more RAM, it simply goes into some of the space that was used by cache, shrinking the cache.  De-allocating cache is cheap and easy enough that it is simply done in real time - everything that sits in the cache is either just a second copy of something that's already on disk, so can just be deallocated instantly, or it's something that we would have had to flush to disk within the next few seconds anyway, thus there is zero performance hit in re-allocating cache to applications.\nSo, when a tool refers to \"free\" RAM, you need to clarify whether it is including cache as \"free\" or not. Cache should be thought of as \"free\", even though tools such as ps and free do not include it in the \"free\" count. \nThis is not a situation that is specific to Linux - all modern operating systems work this way.  The different operating systems might just report free RAM differently: some include the cache as part of what they consider \"free\" and some may not.\nWhen you talk about free RAM, it's a lot more meaningful to include cache, because it practically is free - it's available should any application request it.  On Linux, the free command reports it both ways - the first line includes cache in the used RAM column, and the second line includes cache (and buffers) in the free column.\n", "Q: I downloaded Scrabble game through software center but can not login I downloaded Scrabble successfully but anytime I try to launch it, there is a problem of login where I would be asked to put my hostname:port.\nPlease does anyone knows how to overcome this problem?\n\nA: If this is the game PyScrabble, then it is an online multiplayer game and you need to connect to a PyScrabble server to play against other players. \nYou can try the Find Public Server to find one. \nHowever, as PyScrabble has not been maintained since 2007 there may not be any servers still around. \n", "Q: How can I set up ubuntu to switch back to English after a few minutes of inactivity? I'm using Ubuntu for several years now and enjoy it immensly. I'm developing software in PHP and Javascript for a living.\nThe only minor annoyance I have is that I would like the PC to switch back for me to English as the main keyboard language since I sometimes forget it in Hebrew and then when I return to type some shell command or just unlock it I notice it's in the other language after I press Enter.\nYou might dismiss this as a really edge case but I'm curious if there's a script I can write to set a timer which after a certain amount of keyboard inactivity (I might be reading some ebook and use the mouse) switches back to my default language which is English on the keyboard settings.\nA bonus would be if I could exclude arrow keys and page-down and similar keys from the script and let the timer keep on ticking if those keys were pressed.\n\nA: That is very well possible, with the help of a background script, using xprintidle, which returns the current idle time.\nYou will need to install it first:\nsudo apt-get install xprintidle\n\nThe script below reads the output of the command xprintidle and sets your keyboard whenever the set time is passed.\nHow to get the keyboard to be set (index)\nTo create the correct command, the script needs to know the index of the targeted keyboard.

Another translation could be: \"the belief in a universal bond\n  of sharing that connects all humanity\".\n\"A person with ubuntu is open and available to others, affirming of\n  others, does not feel threatened that others are able and good, for he\n  or she has a proper self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or\n  she belongs in a greater whole and is diminished when others are\n  humiliated or diminished, when others are tortured or oppressed.\"\n— Archbishop Desmond Tutu\nAs a platform based on Free software, the Ubuntu operating system\n  brings the spirit of ubuntu to the software world.\n\n\nA: This is discussed at length in The Official Ubuntu Book.

I have a libusb-based program that can't open USB devices on a freshly installed Ubuntu because it lacks permissions. \nThis solution will probably work for me, but it requires manually specifying each and every device - and I have quite a few. So I tried this (in a file /etc/udev/rules.d/41-cvs-permissions.rules):\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", MODE:=\"0666\"\n\nI've omitted VID and PID, hoping that it will simply apply the rule to ALL devices. It definitely has some effect, but the effect is rather weird: instead of detecting 5 devices that it can't open, libusb only detects 2 now - both are USB host controllers, not actual devices.\nHow to achieve what I want? \n\nA: I agree that making rule match using VID/PID is not a definite solution. But you can much multiple devices in same rule without targeting blindly all USB devices the way you did. Example using DRIVER name (usb-storage, usbhid,..) or KERNEL name (tty*, sd*,..) even using minimal regex (sd[a-z][0-9]*, usb*).\nYou should look for similarities in their attributes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all those devices\n\n*Save the current list of devices in /dev\nls /dev > /tmp/dev_list0.txt\n\n\n*Plug one of the target devices\n\n*Save the list of devices in another file\nls /dev > /tmp/dev_list.txt\n\n\n*Compare files, > added device, < removed device\n$ colordiff /tmp/dev_list0.txt /tmp/dev_list.txt\n85a86,87\n> sdc\n> serial\n89a92,93\n> sg4\n> sg5\n93a98\n> sr1\n194a200,201\n> ttyUSB0\n> ttyUSB1\n\nThis is a 3G modem.\n\n*Check the attribute for all interfaces you need, example:\nudevadm info --attribute-walk --name=/dev/ttyUSB0\n\nDo the same for all devices you want. If you can't figure out how, please upload their udevadm info --attribute-walk --name=... output and link them to your question.\nNote that, not all USB devices create a node in /dev. Some you have look for them in SYSFS tree /sys. Then check their attributes using --path\nudevadm info --attribute-walk --path=...\n\nUsing same steps as above you can check which device nodes created by monitoring udev events:\nudevadm monitor\n\n\nA: The way I deal with USB devices is to give a specific group access to all of them. \nAs root:\necho 'SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"plugdev\"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/00-usb-permissions.rules\nudevadm control --reload-rules\n\nEssentially what this does is grant read and write access for any usb device to members of the plugdev group.\n", "Q: dpkg: error processing package w3c-markup-validator I have installed w3c-markup-validator on Ubuntu 14.04 with this command:\nsudo apt-get install w3c-markup-validator\n\nAfter that, each time I run apt-get update, apt-get upgrade or apt-get install I get following error:\ndpkg: error processing package w3c-markup-validator\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n    w3c-markup-validator\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nInitially, I thought that it had something to do with the fact that there were some issues with w3c-markup-validator related to newer Apache version, but even after fixing those issues as stated in Install wc3 markup validator locally, this error message still occurs every time I use apt-get.\nIs there any way to supress this one error message? Optionally, what might be cause of this error message?\n\nA: (I wanted to just add a comment to Rho's answer, but I am new here so)\nI believe that purging will do the work.\nIf you:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge w3c-markup-validator\n\nOr, in case it doesn't work:\nsudo dpkg --purge w3c-markup-validator\n\nThen follow Rho's sequence, it will be fixed.\n sudo dpkg --configure -a \n\n sudo apt-get install -f \n\n sudo apt-get update \n\n sudo apt-get install -f \n\nRegards.\n\nA: It seems to me that after the install you got your package system corrupted.

There's an example from serverfault, https://serverfault.com/questions/208128/how-to-remotely-install-linux-via-ssh, of someone doing a very similar process. Their idea of testing the process on a VM first makes lots of sense.\nIn general, for particular packages/apps you can use sudo apt-get purge $PKG-NAME to remove a deb package and all its config files - sometimes apt-get refuses to remove config files that have been altered or directories with other non-install files present. I use updatedb; locate -e -i $APP-NAME to find such files. Once purged and config files have been removed then install each app afresh.\nAnother option is to use sudo aptitude (a package management interface to apt-get), say, select all installed apps and choose to remove them (press \"-\" when on \"installed\" line of main screen) then find (\"/\") ubuntu-desktop (or your preferred meta-package) and add it (\"+\" when the package is highlighted).

It gives you lots of such options to edit your pdf files.\nOpen your pdf using Okular and \npress  F6 or \n\nTools --> Review\n\nIt will show some tabs on the left side. Selecting these will enable you to do many functions such as underline, highlight, freehand line, ellipse, polygon, etc. Using  freehand line option, you can write on your pdf.

I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.10 and for some reason, they took mencoder out of the repos...I need it for a program called universal media server to encode videos to play on my ps3 from my pc. how can I install it on ubuntu 14.10? thanks!\n\nA: Step 1: download the Ubuntu 14.04 .deb file from http://pkgs.org/download/mencoder. If you used dpkg at this point to install this, you would run into dependency problems. Specifically, the packages libavcodec54, libavcodec-extra-54, libavformat54, libavutil52 and libswscale2 may not be installed on your system. However, you may have newer packages installed, or there may be newer packages available, that provide the same functionality. Therefore, we are going to modify the .deb file.\nStep 2: find out what versions of these packages are already installed on your system:\napt-cache policy libavcodec*\n(and likewise for the other packages) will tell you that. If none is installed, but one is available, say libavcodec56 has an installation candidate, install it (sudo apt-get install libavcodec56). Make a note of the version, i.e. the last two digits, of each package. Note, however, that you need either libavcodec54 or libavcodec-extra-54, not both.\nStep 3: download a script called videbcontrol. It is available from here. You want to make it executable; and if you don't like vi you may edit the script, find the line that uses vi (line 35 of the current script), and change that to nano or any other preferred editor.\nStep 4: run the videbcontrol script against the deb file: \nvidebcontrol mencoder_1.1+dfsg1_0ubuntu3_amd64.deb\nOr whichever deb file you have downloaded. (You may need to specify path names here, but you don't need sudo). This will open the deb's control file. In it you will find a line with \"Depends on:\" listing the packages that I mentioned in Step 1. Now carefully replace the version numbers with the ones that you have actually installed in Step 2. Closing the editor will save the .deb file als a .modified.deb file.\nStep 5: Install the modified .deb file using sudo dpkg -i mencoder[version].modified.deb . Hopefully, all the dependencies will be satisfied at this point.\nIncidentally, this is how I installed the nixnote2 beta on my system, with more or less the same dependencies.\n", "Q: After rebooting, the landscape service is unavailable I have installed openstack landscape.

Disk access in this VM is noticeably slow - it takes ages just to start Firefox, for example, and the disk light is on the whole time. hdparm -tT confirms this:\n/dev/sda:\n Timing cached reads:   18100 MB in  1.99 seconds = 9073.75 MB/sec\n Timing buffered disk reads:  42 MB in  3.54 seconds =  11.85 MB/sec\n\nHowever, I have 2 other VMs on the same host partition (Ubuntu 11.04 and 14.04) and they're both OK:\n/dev/sda:\n Timing cached reads:   17388 MB in  2.00 seconds = 8703.76 MB/sec\n Timing buffered disk reads: 210 MB in  3.07 seconds =  68.37 MB/sec\n\n/dev/sda:\n Timing cached reads:   17012 MB in  2.00 seconds = 8511.87 MB/sec\n Timing buffered disk reads: 282 MB in  3.01 seconds =  93.63 MB/sec\n\nThe big difference is that the slow machine has been used a lot over time and had a lot of stuff installed, so the virtual disk is 32GB (vs 4GB and 6GB for the other VMs). What can I do to restore disk performance? I tried the VMware De-fragment and Compact commands that they didn't help. The file system is ext4 in all 3 cases.\n\nA: I ended up creating a new virtual disk in VMware and manually copying the data across. It worked - the machine is now noticeably faster and hdparm reports:\n/dev/sda:\n Timing cached reads:   18598 MB in  1.99 seconds = 9322.95 MB/sec\n Timing buffered disk reads: 394 MB in  3.00 seconds = 131.31 MB/sec\n\nThe steps were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the machine.\n\n*Add a new virtual disk device (sdb).\n\n*Boot from an Ubuntu LiveCD.\n\n*Partition the new disk (I had only 1 partition).\n\n*mount both old and new partitions\n\n*copy data using cp -ax /mnt/sda1 /mnt/sdb1\n\n*Shut down\n\n*Remove the old disk and change the new one to node SCSI 0:0, so it becomes \"sda\".\n\n*Boot from the Ubuntu LiveCD again and fix grub using the \"via chroot\" method\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab, which referred to the old partition by UUIDs to use /dev/sda1 (or I could have used the new UUID)\n\n*Reboot from the new disk and enjoy a faster VM!\n\n", "Q: Using external usb disk as extra partition I searched a lot on the internet but have not find an exact match for this question, so don't downvote this question just yet.\nSo, I have Linux Mint 32-bit installed on my computer and I'm running out of space because my original disk is small. I have an external usb disk with 300Gb and so I was thinking of connecting it to the computer and put it to function as another partition where I can install programs.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I do this easily?\n\n*What happens when I disconnect and then connect again the usb storage disk?\n\n*Does the usb disk need to be formatted and/or does one need to put a linux OS in the disk?\n\n*If the answer to \"can I install programs to the external usb\" is yes, when I execute the programs from that mounted partition i.e. the external usb drive, are they going to be slower? And does the answer depend on whether the drive is a USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 (or eSata)?\n\n\nA: Take a look at this question:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1574068\nThere is a way to do what you ask for but not directly though.\n  First you'll need to be on a Live USB session.\nNow in your USB hardisk, create a Linux partition (ext4 is preferable) and copy the entire /usr directory from the flag drive to the usb drive.\nAfter that you'll need to edit /etc/fstab to change the mount point of the existing/usr IN THE FLASH DRIVE to point it to the USB drive.\nEdit:\nAlmost forgot, don't even think about un-mounting the hard drive once the process is done. It might be a disaster.\nEdit2:\nProcedure:\n1) Place your Ubuntu Installation disc into the drive and boot to Live Session (Try Ubuntu).\n2) Now, open the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the below code and press Enter.\nsudo passwd root\n\nType in a password for the root account (moving /usr directory is best using su rather than sudo as it might not turn out well and so, we defined a root password.  \n3) Now, connect the external hard disk and wait for it to show up. Backup any data on the drive as we will be FORMATTING it soon.\n4) a) Next step is locating the root partition (/ partition). In the terminal, run su - and type in the root password you have set up in step 2.\n   b) Type fdisk -l /dev/sda  where /dev/sda is the internal disk of the computer.\n   c)  (i)   It will list out all the partitions of your hard drive. Here, use the trial and error method, we will determine the / partition.\n       (ii)  Type mkdir temp in the terminal. This will create a directory called temp at /root/.\n       (iii) Type mount /dev/sdax temp (where x is any linux partition you found in step 4.b\n       (iv)  Type ls temp and see if you have lot of directories like bin, etc, usr, etc.\n       (v) If yes, proceed to step 5 or type umount temp and go back to step 4.3 (increment the value of x this time).\nNote: The umount command is important to free the temp folder we created for mounting the partitions\n5) Since you have the found the root partition, it is time to create a Linux partition on the external harddrive. Install gparted from the commands:\napt-get update && apt-get install gparted -y\n\ngparted is recommended to perform such delicate operations as there is a chance of ERASING THE WRONG PARTITION.\n6) Open gparted by typing gparted on the terminal. You will see a window like this:\n   Here, change the device to your external harddrive by using the drop down list on the top-right of gparted.\n7) Click on each partition in the list (like /dev/sda1,/dev/sda2 etc.) and press the Delete key on the keyboard.\nRepeat the step to delete all the partitions and goto Partition>New.\n8) Select ext4 on \"File System\" drop-down list at the window.\n9) Click on the green tick mark to confirm the actions and wait while the external harddisk is partitioned.\n10) Now close gparted and open Nautilus and mount the newly created hard drive.\n11) Now, on the terminal type 'mv /usr /dev/sdb1 --verbose (mostly the external harddrive WILL be /dev/sdb1 but make sure you are mounting the right one.)\n12) Wait patiently until the directory is moved to the hard drive.\n13) Now, we have to edit the mount points to add the new path of /usr directory.\n14) Type sudo blkid > ids on the terminal to print the UUID of all the devices connected to Ubuntu. This step is mandatory as by default, UUID's are used by Ubuntu in /etc/fstab\n15) Open the ids file we created in step 14 using gedit or Nautilus (your wish and copy the UUID part of the external harddrive)\n16) Now, go to the previously opened terminal (or if it is busy or you closed it, open the terminal again and type su -c)\n17) Type gedit /etc/fstab to open the fstab file and now add the /usr entry as:\n<uuid-here> /usr            ext4    rw              0       1\n\nand save the file.\n18) Now, reboot the desktop. Don't unplug the USB HDD but take out the installation disc from the cd drive.\nIF everything works out, you will see the Ubuntu login screen.

If you use openssl s_client... to connect to the site it also shows that the site sends the full chain (including the root certificate, which it should not). But if you take other tools to check you might fail instead because the site sends only the lead certificate and misses the necessary chain certificates. \nIt took me a while to figure it out, but at the end it turned out to be a misconfigured server: As long as you use IPv4 the server returns the full certificate chain, but if you use IPv6 the server returns only the leaf certificate. This means that all the successful tools used IPv4, all the tools with errors used IPv6. As for the browsers: the failed browser must have used IPv6, the other might have used it too, but might have this certificate cached from visiting other sites using the same chain certificate.\n\nA: Check your system's time and date. Sometimes, SSL warnings are a result of the computer's time and date being set incorrectly meaning the certificate is invalid (either too new, or too old).\nI've had this issue on my own website, which was resolved after I actually reset my system clock to an accurate time.\n", "Q: Increase Trackpoint Sensititvity with SystemD (Ubuntu 15.04 or later) My upstart job which configured my trackpoint sensitivity (Values 255, 255) does not work anymore.

How would I undo \nsudo mv tmp/* usr/local/bin?\n\nA: You'll have to distinguish which files in /usr/local/bin are actually binary files meant to stay there and which are temporary files moved accidentally with mv, anyway /tmp is used by applications to temporary store files which are to be deleted in any case upon the next reboot, so as long as you're not concerned with the applications running in the current session possibly crashing/losing data, the worst case scenario is you might have a handful of unuseful temporary files in /usr/local/bin, but still, such directory is always empty upon Ubuntu installation, so it might even have been still empty/almost empty before the mv unless some application installed some binary in there, plus temporary files should be easy distinguishable from binaries, in the end you should be able to easily restore everything back to normal manually moving the temporary files back to /tmp\n\nA: Unfortunately the answer is a \"NO\". Only thing you can do is to be careful when you do something as root user. May be you can search the directory for that file and move it back using the same mv command\n\nA: Linux doesn't natively provide an undo feature. The philosophy is that if it's gone, it's gone. If it was important, it should have been backed up.\nThere is a fuse filesystem that automatically keeps copies of old versions: copyfs, available in all good distributions. Of course, that can use a lot of resources.\nThe best way to protect against such accidents is to use a version control system (cvs, bazaar, darcs, git, mercurial, subversion,etc).

Why does this happen and how can I stop it?\n\nA: I just had the same problem. You can figure out what keystrokes just took place (after dismissing the window) with \"C-h l\". In my case it was C-mouse-1 because on my laptop the mouse pad is right where I like to rest my palms when typing. Even though I use a regular mouse, it still processes the mouse pad. You can disable it by using global-set-key to make C-mouse-1 undefined (simply provide no new setting).\n\nA: Quick workaround: Before typing in an emacs window that displays this behavior, move the mouse cursor to a region of the window where Ctrl-mouse-1 has no effect (eg. the top \"window handle\" region. Now you can type without fear of having the buffer menu popup on you every so often. (I hope).\nThe permanent fix is somewhere outside of emacs, either in the window manager, or X11 configuration.  By default, emacs has variable: make-pointer-invisible set to t (true) which will cause proper behavior when typing. Something external to emacs is causing emacs to only sometimes hide the pointer when typing.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Super+Tab switcher shortcut Unity Tweak Tool How can I set <Super>+<Tab> to be my shortcut for the window switcher?

I recently got into the programming side of things. Bought a Raspbery pi and stoked out about learning some basics. I wanted to install Ubuntu on my computer and was wondering if anybody can shed some light on this. \nI have a mac-book pro and have a windows 7 partition on it. Instead of downloading a third party program (eg refit) is it possible to install Ubuntu on the window 7 partition of the mac.\nMy thoughts: \n- set windows partition to be the boot up OS \n-follow instruction on how to dual boot windows\nIs this possible?\n- partition a partition (I guess)\n\nA: It is not possible to \"partition a partition.\" (Well, that's not entirely true; there are some exotic situations in which this can be done, but they don't apply in your case.) What you can do is to shrink the Windows partition and create a new partition for Ubuntu in its place.\nAs to dual- or triple-booting, you need some sort of boot manager for your Mac. Several programs can work, but each has its caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Mac's firmware -- Holding down the Option key as you power on should bring up the Mac's built-in boot manager. Many users consider this a bit awkward, and the resulting boot manager is rather limited in its capabilities. (It might or might not correctly detect all your OSes, for instance.)\n\n*rEFIt -- This boot manager is abandonware, but still usable for certain purposes. It has problems with Yosemite's LVM configuration unless you install it to the EFI System Partition (ESP), which requires manual installation.\n\n*rEFInd -- This is a currently-maintained fork of rEFIt that better handles both Yosemite and Linux. Disclaimer: I maintain rEFInd.\n\n*GRUB -- This is the default Ubuntu boot manager. It's not a good choice as your primary boot manager on Macs because it comes in two forms (BIOS and EFI), and neither type can cross-boot using the other method. Unfortunately, that's more-or-less required in a Windows/OS X dual-boot. GRUB is often used as a secondary boot program, though, in conjunction with one of the preceding ones.\n\n\nThere are other options, but the above four are the most common ones on Macs.\nAlso, you should be aware of the difference between a boot manager and a boot loader. The former presents a menu or command line that you use to select which OS to boot; the latter loads an OS kernel into memory and executes it. Some programs, such as GRUB, are both boot loaders and boot managers. The Linux kernel includes its own EFI boot loader, which also tends to blur the distinction, since this feature enables a boot manager to work a lot like a boot loader.\nOne more point: The way the Mac mixes EFI and BIOS-mode boots requires use of a hybrid MBR, which is an ugly and dangerous hack. Many users trip up on this detail, particularly when triple-booting, since many tools do a poor job of deciding which GPT partitions to replicate in the hybrid MBR, whose capacity is limited to at most three real partitions. You may need to use gdisk or the version of gptsync that comes with rEFInd (not the older version that comes with rEFIt) to create a working hybrid MBR for a triple-boot computer.\nOverall, my recommendation is to not attempt a triple-boot on a Mac; it's too much hassle. Instead, install one or at most two OSes and run the rest in a virtual machine. That will be easier and safer to set up and will be less likely to cause problems. I realize this isn't always a practical course of action, but it's my recommendation whenever it is practical.\n", "Q: HP Stream 11 Touchpad buttons not working correctly So I have just bought a HP stream 11 and installed Ubuntu Gnome 14.10.

A background script keeps track of the current workspace and changes the set of links on your desktop, according to how you set it up.\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses wmctrl to get information on the current workspace:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*In your home directory (not in a subdirectory, but on the \"first\" level), create a directory (exactly) named:\ndesktop_data\n\ninside this directory, create for each of your (in this example four) desktops, a folder named (exactly):\ndesktop_1\ndesktop_2\ndesktop_3\ndesktop_4\n\n\n\n*In these folders, create links to all folders that you want to appear on the corresponding desktop. If, for example, you want the folder Documents to appear on viewport (workspace) 1, create a link:\nln -s ~/Documents ~/desktop_data/desktop_1/Documents\n\nand so on, for all folders you want to appear on the targeted desktop(s):\n\nNB If you also want a set of launchers per desktop, add the launchers to the folder and make them executable (!).\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as change_desktop.py. Test-run it by running in a terminal window the command:\npython3 /path/to/change_desktop.py\n\nSwitch workspaces like you use to do since the script acts on switching workspaces.\nNB if you also want a set of launchers, specific to the different workspaces, uncomment the line:\nif os.path.islink(subject) or subject.endswith(\".desktop\"):\n\nbut make sure the line:\n# if os.path.islink(subject):\n\nis commented out (put a # in front of the line)\nIn the example above, the folders Documents, Netwerkmap and screen_notes appear on workspace 1, but not on workspace 2 (3,4)\nIf all works fine, add it to your startup applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\nimport shutil\n\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ndesktop_dir = home+\"/\"+\"Bureaublad\"\ndata_dirstr = home+\"/desktop_data/desktop_\"\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\n# get resolution\nxr = get(\"xrandr\").split()\nplus = 2 if xr[xr.index(\"connected\")+1] == \"primary\" else 1\nres = [int(n) for n in xr[xr.index(\"connected\")+plus].split(\"+\")[0].split(\"x\")]\n\ndef get_dt():\n    # get the current viewport\n    vp_data = subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-d\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    dt = [int(n) for n in vp_data[3].split(\"x\")]\n    cols = int(dt[0]/res[0])\n    curr_vpdata = [int(n) for n in vp_data[5].split(\",\")]\n    curr_col = int(curr_vpdata[0]/res[0])+1; curr_row = int(curr_vpdata[1]/res[1])\n    return str(curr_col+curr_row*cols)\n\ncurr_dt1 = get_dt()\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    curr_dt2 = get_dt()\n    # alter the set of links when workspace changes\n    if not curr_dt1 == curr_dt2:\n        datafolder = data_dirstr+curr_dt2\n        for f in os.listdir(desktop_dir):\n            subject = desktop_dir+\"/\"+f\n            # uncomment one of the two lines below\n            if os.path.islink(subject):                                       # uncomment for only folders (links to) per workspace\n            # if os.path.islink(subject) or subject.endswith(\".desktop\") :    # uncomment for folders and .desktop files per workspace\n            #\n                os.remove(subject)\n        for f in os.listdir(datafolder):\n            subject = datafolder+\"/\"+f; target = desktop_dir+\"/\"+f\n            if os.path.islink(subject):\n                os.symlink(os.readlink(subject), target)\n            else:\n                shutil.copy(subject,target)\n    curr_dt1 = curr_dt2\n\nBrief explanation\nIf the script starts up, it checks the screen's resolution. It then checks once per second what is the current workspace, and sees if there was a workspace switch. If so, it copies the links that you placed in the corresponding folder in ~/desktop_data to your desktop, and removes the links that are not.\nImportant note\nIn your localized version of Ubuntu, Desktop might be named differently (\"Bureaublad\" in Dutch for example). If so, change in the script the line:\ndesktop_dir = home+\"/\"+\"Desktop\" \n\nto reflect your localized name of the Desktop folder.\n\nA: I'm sorry but this functionality is currently not supported. You could try play with 3rd-party software like screenlets but I would strongly not recommend it.\n", "Q: Disks Utility Drive Settings – how does it work? (no documentation available) The Disks Utility gnome-disk-utility 3.10.0 has a lot of neat functions, but I can not find a documentation, especially about the options at Drive Settings. There can be several like Standby Time, Advanced Power Management, Automatic Acoustic Management or Write Cache, depending of the options the drive supports.\n\n\nHow to use the Drive Settings in general? By default the switches at all settings tabs are \"off\" – but if I'm not mistaken, this means that the settings shown in grey are the drive's active default and only if you want to change that, you have to switch the settings tab \"on\" and change the setting accordingly. Right?\nSo this is a quite easy way to disable the write cache for specific hard disk drives for more security (prevent data loss in extreme situations), if you want to! The \"old\" way was to use hdparm on the terminal.\n\nA: Unfortunately, gdisks hasn't seen much development lately, so the \"old\" way is the \"new\" way again...  The disadvantage of FLOSS at work.  :-(\nSo as development is stalled, manuals are probably never going to happen. ;-(\nSorry to be the harbinger of bad news...\n", "Q: Help with Nexus 7 I want install ubuntu touch in a tablet Nexus 7 2012. I know it is deprecated, but I know it is yet possible although I did not understand the complete steps for do it. Someone can help please? \n\nA: There have been no builds for the Nexus 7 2012 for well over a year and the system images will soon be deleted if they have not already been.  Plus, the old images are outdated and were not extensively tested.\nUnfortunately, due to the lack of binary drivers, it is not possible to install Ubuntu on the Nexus 7 2012 any longer.\n", "Q: KVM VPS and data safety I'm looking into setting up a mail server (running Ubuntu, ofcourse), but I need it to run reliably (in case it's good enough to start using it instead of only Gmail) so I found a VPS provider that seems trustworthy and that uses KVM, instead of my Ubuntu server at home. I want my mails to be stored safely and encrypted, as a precaution (though I know it won't protect against some hacker accessing it while it's still running). This is easily done by using Encfs (provided I log in and decrypt it after boot).\nWhile doing research on running a mail server in a VPS, I learned that the provider (or a hacker) is always able to read what my VPS is doing. It was claimed (second paragraph) this is very easy to do if you're using OpenVZ, but if my provider (or more likely, if at all, a hacker) wanted to do the same with a KVM or Xen VM (s)he needs to reboot my VM. However, I couldn't find more information about this.\nMy question:\nIf someone has access to my KVM VM and wanted to go through the data on my VM, what could that person read? For example, would that person just get a copy of my VM in an unbooted state, so therefore with the encrypted Encfs folder still locked when booted if they don't know my encryption password? Or could they access a running VM with the Encfs folder that I decrypted? (I hope my question makes sense.)\nI know my provider or a hacker wouldn't be very interested in reading my e-mail, but better safe than sorry. GPG isn't that widely used yet.\n\nA: Physical access is root access, so if someone has physical access to the server, regardless on if it is on a VM or bare metal, they have root access. In the case of KVM the owner of the bare metal host can access the guest. You can always encrypt the data, but, that may be of limited benefit as the data will be decrypted when you access it.\nSame with the network. The owner of the VM can see your network traffic. Again you can encrypt some of the traffic (https, ssh, etc).\n", "Q: The disk drive for‭ ‬/media/My_Passport is not ready yet or not present I have a dual boot with Mint MATE and Xubuntu on ONE hard drive.‭  ‬I NOW have a problem when booting into Xubuntu with a notice of the following:\nThe disk drive for‭ ‬/media/My_Passport is not ready yet or not present.‭ ‬Continue to wait,‭ ‬or Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery.

These are:  bootwait which can be applied to remote filesystems mounted outside of /usr or /var, without which mountall(8) would not hold up the boot for these; nobootwait which can be applied to non-remote filesystems to explicitly instruct mountall(8) not to hold up the boot for them;\n", "Q: Bootchart and how to optimize boot time I have spent some time researching how to decrease my boot time.

What things are installed in my computer? I'd like to find this missing plug-in so I can package it into my .deb. I think it must be a .so file, but I just don't know which one.\nCan anyone help me? Thanks.\n\nA: dpkg -L gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg will tell you the package's contents. But since you're building your own deb, I would strongly recommend to specify gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg as a dependency, instead of packaging the plugin; if gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg is already installed, the installation of your package would fail since dpkg will refuse to overwrite the file (a single file can't be owned by more than one package).\n", "Q: can't change file permissions of key file I have a .pem file. The normal chmod [4/6]00 [key_name_here].pem command doesn't work.

I have done a lot of commands but didn't have any success.\nHow can I give permission to each and every thing in htdocs?\n\nA: You need to change permissions or ownership of htdocs directory. To change the permissions use the chmod command, for example:\n$sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/lampp/htdocs\n\nTo see who is currently logged user, run:\n$whoami\n\nTo change the owner use the chown command:\n$sudo chown -R username:username /opt/lampp/htdocs\n\nAlso, you can use find command to change the permissions only on specific files. For example, to change the permissions on all css files in htdocs directory run the following command:\nsudo find /opt/lampp/htdocs -type f -name \"*.css\"  -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\n\n\nA: sudo chown -R daemon wordpress-folder\n\n// or use htdocs folder\n\nthe xampp apache server uses a user named daemon to access the folders inside htdocs, this will fix all the permission problems.\n\nA: That's what helped me:\nsudo chown -R youruser:youruser /opt/lampp/htdocs\nAlso you can make changes in httpd.conf file:\nsudo gedit /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf\n", "Q: What is the best practice of customizing the Bash prompt (aka the PS1 environment variable)?

So I am looking for a perfect place to put this line into.\nThese are the places I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*.profile: not sourced by gnome-terminal\n\n*.bash_profile: not sourced by gnome-terminal\n\n*.bash_login: not sourced by gnome-terminal\n\n*.bash_aliases: works, but I don't think PS1 has anything to do with aliases\n\n\nI am using Ubuntu Desktop and I work in gnome-terminal or byobu, so I have to find a file which is sourced when I start bash in an X environment. Then I looked in .bashrc for other files it sources after assigning a value to PS1. There are .bash_aliases and /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion which I don't think are proper for this purpose.\nWhat are other choices? And what is the best practice of customizing Bash prompt?\n\nA: According to the following HOWTO, your .bashrc is actually the best place to tweak $PS1:\n\nthe PS1 string should be set in .bashrc. this is because non-interactive bashes go out of their way to unset PS1. the bash man\n  page tells how the presence or absence of PS1 is a good way of knowing\n  whether one is in an interactive vs non-interactive (ie script) bash\n  session.\n[...]\ntherefore it should be stressed that PS1=..blah.. should be in .bashrc and not .profile.\n\nSource: http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/setps.html\n\nA: I agree with @sylvain-pineau that it should be located in .bashrc.\nIm using a git-prompt shell script that I've forked on github. It works very well with git, svn and hg.

So in the above example, in the first iteration of the loop this will happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*ccc_fo01_c_000.jpeg and ccc_fo01_c_001.jpeg will be copied(not moved) from ccc/fo01 to ccc\n\n*ddd_fo01_d_000.jpeg and ddd_fo01_d_001.jpeg will be copied(not moved) from ddd/fo01 to ddd\n\n*lll_fo01_l_000.jpeg and lll_fo01_l_001.jpeg will be copied(not moved) from lll/fo01 to lll\nand in the end of the first iteration, those copied jpegs (in ccc ddd lll) will be deleted from ccc ddd lll so that as if I didn't make the copying.\nSame with every iteration on the subfolders. So this means that in the above example, the copying then deleting process will happen two times as there are two subfloders fo01 and fo02. But in my case there are more subfolders. So if anyone could please advise how this can be done.\n\nA: Here is a suggestion on how to do it:\nFirst you iterate over the folders, inside every folder you search and find the files and copy them to its parent folder. \n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Iterate over the folders    \nfor folder in main/*\ndo\n    #Copy the files into the folder\n    find $folder -name \"*.jpeg\" -type f -exec cp {} $folder \\; -print\ndone\n\n#After its done: delete the originals\nfind main -mindepth 3 -name \"*.jpeg\" -type f -delete\n\nI just wrote a quick find to delete the files at the end. You could also do this from within the for loop.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 RAM not usable -- mallocate problem I have a strange situation where my Ubuntu server (14.04) is not recognizing all of the memory installed in my server.

(I don't use Opera - so this point I'm not sure of).  \nIf it refuses to die, use sudo killall -9 opera which is more heavy-handed but should do it.  \nIf you know the process Opera is using to play, you could just kill that - more subtle!\n\nA: Workspaces are an abstraction of most window managers (GNOME, KDE, LXDE, OpenBox, BusyBox, etc.). Though, honestly, they are only there for organizational purposes and don't reflect the underlying behavior of the actual processes. By this, I mean that each process is not tied to a workspace process.\nSay you open Opera in workspace one in GNOME. A partial process tree might look something like this:\nGNOME\n  Firefox\n\nNow, let's say that you switch to workspace two and launch Rhythmbox:\nGNOME\n  Firefox\n  Rhythmbox\n\nSo, as you can see, from an underlying process hierarchy standpoint there is no way to separate which applications are running in which workspace. At this point, only the window manager itself knows which applications (actually, application windows) appear on which workspace. So, unless there is a way to query the window manager (in this case, GNOME) as to which windows are on a workspace and which process those windows belong to, there would be no easy way to do this.\nThere is also the scenario where you might have one process with two windows. For example, you may have two Opera windows with one window on each workspace. Doing such a thing would have the side effect of closing all of your Opera windows, even on the non-troublesome workspace since more than likely (I'm unsure about Opera, but I know Firefox behaves this way) both application windows are tied to the same process. So, even if it were feasible, there may very well be some unintended consequences of this.\nSo, long story short: no, there really isn't a way to kill processes dependent on which workspace they reside on. In such a case I would do @diEcho described and switch to a virtual terminal (Ctrl-Alt-F1 through F6 usually) and kill the troublesome process with the kill command. Of course, this assumes that you know which process is causing the issue which isn't always the case.\nFor your specific problem related to audio, there is another way to accomplish this task: pavucontrol (assuming you're using the default PulseAudio and not Jack, ALSA, or OSS). Pavucontrol gives the ability to adjust the volume of or mute individual applications. So, while it wouldn't fix the inability to go to WS1 and directly shot down Opera, it would have solved the audio issue.\n", "Q: Incorrect 'date modified' in Ubuntu 14.04 When copying files of the same name between folders (and overwriting), or even renaming a single file, it seems the 'date modified' doesn't change, which is supremely annoying as you can imagine.\nIs there some way to display and sort by the date any part of the file was modified in anyway?\n\nA: *\n\n*You can use the 'touch' utility to change the file date/time.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the command line interface, short version explanation: $ touch --help\n\n*For long version explanation: $ info coreutils 'touch invocation'\n\n\n*To display the contents of a directory, sorted by date: $ ls -lS\n\nA: There is something known as the hash value for each file.

In the right-click menu I see no options for running the file in the terminal.\nI've tried doing this with other files as well. For instance, I installed WINE and tried to install a Window's program. WINE said to simply run the installer, but nothing would happen when I tried. I marked it to run as a program and still it wouldn't work.

I don't remember what the package was, but the only package in that category right now is appmenu-qt5. As far as I can tell, removing that package has affected nothing, and I'm pretty sure I had issues with running files as programs since I got my Ubuntu.\nEDIT: I have checked, and I don't think this question is a duplicate of this question.

Thank you! :)\n\nA: I have adjusted the thinkpad-yoga-script to work for the Thinkpad Yoga 14 S3: https://github.com/johanneswilm/thinkpad-yoga-14-s3-scripts . It takes care of rotation, blocking trackpad when in tablet mode and automatic brightness control  (all issues that weren't taken care of hitherto).\nShould we create a Wiki and update it over time on how to get the different features of the Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 14 (2014 and 2015 editions) to work? Then we can update that over time. Either directly for Ubuntu or simply for all linux distributions.\n\nA: In my experience, Ubuntu boots fine, however not without issue.\nIssues: (as of ubuntu 14.10)\nInstallation: As with all laptops with Windows 8, (pre-installed), UEFI can be a bit of a pain when installing, but this guide should get you through that with no issue. \nTouch Screen: Touch screen works, but there is no multi-touch or scroll support. So for example, when you drag your finger down a website, normally the site would scroll, on Ubuntu it simply clicks the screen repeatedly. This includes the unity dash, which is odd as the interface seems quite touch optimized, but in reality is not.\nRotation: The hinge rotation causes no issues, however the trackpad does not disable itself upon rotation. The accelerometer is not supported as far as I know, so automatic screen rotation does not work either.\nFunction Keys: The basic function keys work, however not all of them if I remember correctly. The volume rocker and power button on the side of the laptop work, however the screen lock button does not.\nNVIDIA Discrete Graphics: Doesn't work out of the box, and will not switch automatically based on the open application, but can be used. Installing nvidia-331 through the Ubuntu repositories will install the necessary drivers, as well as an Nvidia settings panel that includes the option that will allow you to switch between the low power Intel graphics and the NVIDIA graphics card. This does require you to log out and back in to restart the X server before it will take effect.\nIt's been a few months since I ran stock Ubuntu, so some of these things may have changed, however that was my experience.\nMy current setup: I'm currently running Ubuntu Gnome 14.10. Although I much prefer cinnamon or unity, I found Gnome to have by far the most support for the Yoga 14. Gnome is fully touch optimized, so things like scrolling and dragging around windows with touch work flawlessly, as well as two finger scroll and other gestures on the trackpad. All of the function keys on the keyboard work fine, including the function lock, mute key + indicator light, internal mic mute + light, and the trackpoint. It also has fantastic HDPI display support, so everything looks great on the 1080p display of the Yoga, more so than Windows 8.1, which has a huge amount of applications that are either normal size and blurry, or clear but extremely tiny. The trackpad still does not auto-disable however, and auto-rotation does not work, although I am working on finding a fix to that, as manual display rotation is available in the settings and the touch screen correctly rotates its touch points to the screen orientation. The NVIDIA driver can be installed in the same way.\nI'm currently running Windows 8.1 on the internal HDD for the few left over things I still need it for, and its slightly better rotation and touch support, and I've disabled the SSD cashing and have installed Gnome on the 16GB SSD. This setup works great for me, however this may not be optimal if you plan on using linux as your daily driver. Due to this setup, I can't comment on the support for SSD cashing within Ubuntu.\nUpdate in response to question, as of 3/26\nYes I use this configuration for regular work, and keep windows around more for entertainment purposes. 16 GB is a little small, and I store a lot of the larger data on the HDD and access it from linux, so 8GB might be a bit too small for regular work. I've been having some issues with Windows freezing at certain points like logging in, but those issues happened before my install of linux so it is probably not the cause. Other than those issues, the only slow down I've noticed vs with the cashing is slower boot time and the locational application launch taking longer than usual. Linux remains miles faster than Windows in either configuration however. My experience with Windows 8.1 has been that surprisingly, it works quite well with the yoga form factor, but the various freezes, restart requiring bugs, and general slowness make it a bit of a pain to use vs linux. If not for the half baked touch support in linux currently, I would switch full time in an instant.\nUpdate as of 4/7/15\n16 GB proved to be too small for my main OS, so I have now repartitioned my drive to contain a windows partition, shared data partition for documents, movies, and music, and a Linux partition and I have gone back to using the SSD for Windows Caching. I have created two simple scripts that disable/enable the trackpad that I use through launchers to easily toggle tablet mode. user1941046's scripts below this seem to be much more comprehensive than mine, however I have not tried them, so I can't give input on their effectiveness on Ubuntu Gnome. I have not run into any additional issues relating to the Thinkpad Yoga 14 hardware.\n\nA: There is some issue with the internal keyboard and newer kernel versions and the Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga S3 (spring 2015).\nWhen going into standby, the internal keyboard stops reacting afterward some times. If one tries to reboot, the keyboard will work in the BIOS, but not at the cryptsetup login screen. After logging in to the system with a USB keyboard and booting linux entirely, the keyboard works again (most of the times). The problem is present in kernel 4.0, but only happens once every few months. On kernel 4.2.5, it happens almost every time the computer suspends.\nI have not been able to find any other bug report about this. Newer kernel versions are required for some features to work, so this is a major issue.\n\nA: I have  ThinkPad yoga260 with Ubuntu 14.04.  Before that I had a Windows 10 with system encryption by TrueCrypt7.1. And I had the same problem with the internal keyboard. Sometimes I could not input password for TrueCrypt bootloader. I needed to plug USB keyboard to input TrueCrypt password and start Windows. In Windows internal keyboard worked normally. And I had this problem not always but quite often. I can't identify the dependence.\nSo I think that the issue is in the BIOS but not in kernel. Or TrueCrypt 7.1 bootloader uses some parts of Linux kernel. Now I installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with all disk encryption and did not notice this yet. Everything is good except touchscreen and stilus.\n\nA: I am running the yoga 260 with Antergos (Arch) Linux. I have a completely custom setup with Budgie desktop, GDM + gnome-utils etc. Almost everything works out of the box except for a few function keys, accelerometer (screen auto-rotate) and the trackpad doesn't turn off in tablet mode (something I wanna figure out). I was very happy to see how well the Yoga runs linux (even the stylus works!), I just wish it had better tablet-mode support. Overall I would say buy this thing!\n", "Q: Graphical system broken after AMD->Nvidia upgrade. How to re-install all graphical components? I've upgraded my AMD HD4770 with an Nvidia GTX 960. When I boot into Ubuntu, the screen is mostly black with some red artifacts at the top. I can switch with Ctrl+Alt+F1 to a terminal. I've tried removing the AMD drivers and re-installing Nvidia drivers, but it doesn't boot up the graphical interface.\nTo verify that the new graphics cards are working , I've booted into Windows and there it works perfectly fine and runs at full performance.\nSo what can I do to basically re-install the graphical components nicely so it works with my new Nvidia card.

I can use it to boot my desktop and tablet in legacy mode, but not UEFI. Is there any way to make it bootable in UEFI mode? For example, adding an EFI partition and copying grub2 to it? Thanks!\n\nA: You're on the right track. Shrink the existing partition by a little bit, create a new EFI System Partition (ESP) in the space, and install a Linux boot loader on it. A few caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not recommend using GRUB for this task. You may need to hand-craft your configuration file, and with GRUB this is far too difficult to do. Instead, select almost any other EFI boot loader for Linux that you like. My own rEFInd is likely to be easy to set up, and will enable users to boot other installed OSes, too. (OTOH, you might not want that last feature.) ELILO and SYSLINUX are also likely to be relatively easy to configure. If you expect to update your kernels on the drive, be aware that most boot loaders will require updates to their configuration files to match. (rEFInd is an exception to this rule; it auto-detects kernels on each boot.)\n\n*You must install your EFI boot loader as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the ESP. (Assuming you're targeting 64-bit systems.) Normally, EFI boot loaders go to other names and register themselves with the computer's NVRAM; but to boot on multiple computers, you must use the fallback filename of EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. My EFI boot loader installation page covers this topic in more detail.\n\n*EFI systems normally boot from GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks. Your USB drive probably uses the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme instead. In theory, MBR should be OK, but you should be aware that an MBR ESP has a type code of 0xEF. Also, it's entirely possible that some computers will refuse to boot from an MBR flash drive. If you run into this problem, you may need to convert from MBR to GPT. You can do this with gdisk, but then you'll need to re-install a BIOS-mode boot loader.\n\n", "Q: Mounted External Drive Doesn't Show Correct Size I have an external USB drive with 2.0 TB connected to a machine running Ubuntu Server 14.04.\nI used:\n\nfdisk -l\n\nand I can see that my at dev/sdd1.

If this disk is linux-only, use btrfs file system, otherwise you have to use NTFS.\nIf after recreating GPT you still see small size in GParted, you disk is damaged or fake. \n\nA: The Error fdisk is giving you is that it doesn't understand gpt partition tables.

How do I overcome this?\n\nA: The problem is that the character range [a-z] actually includes the upper case letters. This is explained in the bash manual:\n\nWithin a bracket expression, a range expression consists of two characters separated by a hyphen. It matches any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive. In the default C locale, the sorting sequence is the native character order; for example, ‘[a-d]’ is equivalent to ‘[abcd]’. In other locales, the sorting sequence is not specified, and ‘[a-d]’ might be equivalent to ‘[abcd]’ or to ‘[aBbCcDd]’, or it might fail to match any character, or the set of characters that it matches might even be erratic. To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the ‘C’ locale by setting the LC_ALL environment variable to the value ‘C’. \n\nTo illustrate:\n$ case B in [a-c]) echo YES;;  *) echo NO;; esac\nYES\n$ LC_ALL=C; case B in [a-c]) echo YES;; *) echo NO;; esac\nNO\n\nSo, what happens is that in your locale (which is not C), [a-c] is actually [aAbBcC].

As long as newer families are backwards-compatible, they belong to the same architecture.\nDepending which processor architecture specification cpu / mainboard / OS are (literally) built against, you have a different CPU instruction set you can use.\nSince in your case your cpu and your board support the same instruction set that your operating system uses, and your OS doesn't use features your hardware does not support, you have no issues.\n", "Q: If I upgrade Ubuntu from an EOL version to a supported version will my data will lost? If I upgrade Ubuntu from an EOL version to a supported version will my data will lost?\n\nA: The data will be never lost during an update: your data is stored in /home directory, and the upgrade affects the other parts of the system. What might be lost are your app settings and your desktop preferences (it didn't happened never when I made release upgrades, through.).\nIf you are paranoid, backup your important data to an external HDD, disconnect it, and make the upgrade afterwards.\n", "Q: Grub can't be saved after modification I have Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit machine on my lenovo g580.

Why when I exit the terminal(xshell) in Ubuntu 14.10 does my mongoDB(2.6.8)server also terminate?\n\nA: When you start the mongo DB server it gets created as a child process of the terminal, so when you exit the terminal the child process are also terminated.

What still on HDD is /var partition and a swap but I have 8G of RAM. and the backing bcache /home partition.\nI thought it could be the head of HDD parking repeatedly. But a simple script found on the net shows no change in Load_Cycle_Count value from smartctl -a /dev/sdb output\nThe worrying value that keep increasing is Raw_Read_Error_Rate but it is said to be meaningless for Seagate HDD (here ST500LT012) \nEven when I switch to console and stop lightdm, that sound continue.\nBut if I run a short self-test with gsmartcontrol, that sounds suddenly stops. The short self-test passed without error. I run badblocks on /home backing bcache partition and no errors were found.\nI don't know what cause that sound.

Is (was?) bcache in writeback mode?\nIn writeback mode, bcache keeps a buffer of so-called dirty data on the cache. By default, this is 10% of the cache size. It does this to collect sequential data to write to the backing device, since HDDs are good at sequential IO (see koverstreet's post from May 15, 2012 3:43 UTC at this link).\nFor me, the clicking sound stops when I disable this buffer as so:\nsudo -i\necho 0 > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/writeback_percent\n\nI've asked a question about why this happens on superuser here.

Those installs loads of extra software.\n\nA: Cinnamon is developed to be used by a novice user. That is why (among other things) cinnamon is packaged abruptly, so you can not remove a lot of things. The point is that: they want provide all in a simple way to the end user. If we do not create strong dependencies, then a non-experienced user may not know what he must be installed in order to have a fully functional desktop.\nThe applets, desklets and extensions (which truly make the desktop), contain no ways to declare hard dependencies to a package. Therefore, the dependence of all extensions (applets, desklets...) are included inside cinnamon package.

I plugged my Kit-kat android phone up to my Ubuntu 14.04 computer and I enter the terminal and I want to be able to access files on my phone like the media and music folders through the terminal... is this possible?\n\nA: Android devices usually uses the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) when connecting via the USB. This protocol works differently than the traditional USB. \nSimply put, this is a way to ensure that the phone does not share too much data with the computer. The computer makes a query, and the phone answers it. The phone may decide to share the file or ignore  the query. Similarly, when the computer deletes a file, the phone has the ability to decide whether to actually delete the file or not. \nOkay, enough introduction. To access a device connected via MTP, you need the information about it's #Bus and #Dev. To do so, you can run the following command. \nusb-devices\nThis will provide you with a list of connected usb-devices. You need to find your device from this list. It can be a bit tiring, so you can search for the device with the available Manufacturer option. Simply use the following command.\nusb-devices  | grep \"Manufacturer=OnePlus\" -B 3\n\nThis will provide you with 4 lines of information, where the firs line is as follows.\nT:  Bus=02 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#= 13 Spd=480 MxCh= 0\n\nAs you can see here, the associated Bus is 02, and Dev is 13.\nNow change your directory to /run/user/1000/gvfs/ and see the list of folders there. \n/run/user/1000/gvfs/\nls\n\nYou will find the associated MTP device with the #Bus and #Dev in the list. For example, mine was mtp:host=%5Busb%3A002%2C013%5D. Now simply change your directory using the following command.\ncd mtp\\:host\\=%5Busb%3A002%2C013%5D/\n\nVoila!\nYou are inside the file storage!\n\nA: You can find the mount point under the $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gvfs directory. The main directory may be something like mtp:host=… with some escaped characters and USB vendor/product IDs, but you should be able to access your files from in there in a terminal.\n", "Q: Remove Sublime Text 3 completely I want to remove completely Sublime Text 3 from my system.

The -r ensures that backslashes are read literally (so that \\t matches a \\ and a t and not a TAB). The -- ensures that it also deals with file names starting with -. \nYou could also do this in Perl:\nperl -lne '$k{$_}++; END{unlink for keys(%k)}' list.txt\n\nThis one wil read each file name into the %k hash and then use unlink to delete each of them.\n\nA: As I understand it, you have a text file with the files with the complete paths.

Ubuntu sees my hard drive and puts it on the launcher and folder menu but when I start the ubuntu installer it cant find my hard drive. \n\nA: You cannot install to a fat32 filesystem.  Delete one and leave free space for the Ubuntu installer.  The installer will make a root and a swap by default, and if you want, you may select a fourth partition for /home.  \n\nA: If your intent is to create an Ubuntu-only system, then there's no need to create partitions before you install Ubuntu; the Ubuntu installer can handle the partitioning all by itself. The actions you describe may result in what appears to be an empty disk, but that's different from not recognizing the disk at all. Please clarify which is the case.\nIf the disk appears empty, and if you want an Ubuntu-only system, just proceed and let the Ubuntu installer create partitions (or create them manually yourself if you have reason to deviate from the Ubuntu defaults).\nIf the Ubuntu installer claims you have no hard disk installed, then that most likely means that your disk is too new for your kernel. If you're trying to install a relatively old version of Ubuntu, using a more recent version might help. If your hardware is very new (meaning the design, not necessarily when the machine was built), you might have to wait or use a plug-in card (if it's a desktop model) to get it to work.\n\nA: I figured it out all i had to do was go in the terminal and typesudo dmraid -rE\n", "Q: Recover Windows files I was trying to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7.

Do my results mean that my \"Windows partition\" is \"mounted?\" How do I recover my Windows files? Do I need TestDisk?\n\nA: The (very small piece of) good news: Ejecting the disc early did not cause your problems. Don't beat yourself up over that.\nThe rest is bad news, I'm afraid. Your hard disk is, in technical terms, a complete and utter mess. :-(\nYour /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, and /dev/sda4 are all of type 0x42. This type is also identified as \"SFS\" by fdisk, although that acronym actually refers to a use that's no longer common -- it's really a Windows 2000 (and later) dynamic disk (aka logical disk manager, or LDM), which is similar to (but incompatible with) the Linux logical volume manager (LVM).\nIn any event, my guess is that you started with an LDM configuration in Windows, but either you or the Ubuntu installer didn't correctly identify it as such. Instead, either you or the Ubuntu installer tried to resize the LDM partitions as if they were plain filesystems to make room for Ubuntu. This was a BIG mistake, because it damaged the LDM setup and may have damaged the filesystems contained within it. This resulted in a trashed Windows installation. What's more, your hopes of a full recovery are slim (but not nonexistent).\nAs a first step, I suggest you back up all your data files that you can actually read. Do this from Linux and/or Windows emergency tools. If you can't find all your files, do a low-level backup of your entire hard disk to another one, as in:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/big/space/backup.img\n\nYou'll obviously need a big disk to hold the backup; in this example it's mounted at /path/to/big/space. If an attempted repair makes matters worse (and there's a double-digit probability that it will), you'll be able to restore things to the current state from the backup.\nOnce you've got backups, I recommend you boot an emergency disk and delete all your partitions. You can then use TestDisk to try to recover your original NTFS volumes. You may need to fiddle with TestDisk options to get it to recover the right filesystems; do not let it recover any Linux filesystem, since the Linux filesystem may well be overwriting critical NTFS data, and it's the NTFS data you need to recover. This process is unlikely to work completely, but there's a chance that you'll be able to recover at least one filesystem. It may be damaged, though, in which case you'll have to recover it from Windows. Even if you get back a filesystem, some files may be corrupt or lost.\nIf this process fails, your last-resort recovery effort (assuming you don't have existing backups) is to use PhotoRec or some similar tool to do a file-level recovery. The last I checked, PhotoRec didn't do a good job of recovering filenames, so you'll have to sift through files individually to figure out what they are. This will be tedious. I've seen claims that there are commercial Windows tools that do a better job of recovering filenames from NTFS volumes, so you may want to look into such options instead of PhotoRec. I don't know much about these alternatives, though, so I can't recommend a specific product. You might want to ask about this on a Windows forum.\nAs a side note, Windows creates LDM configurations without warning when you create more than four partitions on a disk. If your disk had over four \"partitions\" (really logical volumes) when you started, it had LDM to begin with. If you created new partitions for Linux by using a Windows tool, though, that triggered this whole chain of events. Rule #1 when preparing to install Linux on a system that uses Windows is to not use Windows tools to create Linux partitions. You can use the Windows tools to shrink the Windows partition, but leave that free space unallocated; let the Linux installer create its own partitions in the unallocated space.\n\nEDIT: I just noticed that your fdisk and lsblk outputs are inconsistent about what's what; fdisk suggests that Linux is installed to /dev/sda3, but lsblk suggests it's installed to /dev/sda2. I wrote the above based largely on the fdisk output, but lsblk is probably more trustworthy. Nonetheless, the broad strokes of what I wrote probably still apply.\n\nA: sda1 is your windows partition, sda2 is the partition created to install ubuntu.  Reinstall it and finish it properly this time and everything should work.  When you reinstall, choose manual partitioning and select sda2 to be formatted as ext4 and mounted as \"/\".\n", "Q: i accidently changed the feature of my left shift key now i cant use it how do I change it back?

NOW what?\n\nA: See https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Bash-Startup-Files\n\nWhen Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.\n\nNote, no mention of ~/.bashrc above.\n\nWhen an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, Bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists. This may be inhibited by using the --norc option. The --rcfile file option will force Bash to read and execute commands from file instead of ~/.bashrc.\n\nCheck your terminal application's preferences to see if it launches a login shell or not.\nAlternately, you can add this to your ~/.bash_profile\n[[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] && . ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: A few things to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*.bashrc files don't \"run\", so if you look in a list of processes, you won't see it anywhere, and that's fine.\n\n*bash reads the bashrc file when it starts up, so if you make changes to your bashrc file, they won't take effect until the next time you run bash.  When you're testing edits to your bashrc file, you can easily see the changes just by running bash again (eg, open the terminal and then type \"bash\").  The changes will also get picked up when you log out of Ubuntu and then log back in (locking your screen or going into standby won't work, but logging out or rebooting will work).\n\n*Your .bashrc file has to be in your home directory.  You can verify this by editing the file like vi ~/.bashrc rather than just vi .bashrc\n\nA: As muru did already say there should per default (after first login) be a .bashrc in your home directory /home/youloginname\nTo protect your existing bashrc please create a copy with the following command.\ncp ~/.bashrc ~/mybashrc.backup\n\nAfter this you can restore the default .bashrc , to do this remove first the existing one and then copy it over from the systemwide bashrc.

In Ubuntu, things are unified, so a directory called \"/\" is the root of Ubuntu's view of everything.\nWhen you install Ubuntu, you can set up partitions and choose what parts of the file system is on which partition.  This lets you put, for instance, your user files (which are all stored in /home/your-user-name) on a different partition or a different disk than your installed programs and operating system files (which might be in places like /bin or /usr/bin).\nIf you have a disk mounted but you didn't configure Ubuntu to use that disk for its OS files or for your home directory, it's probably in /media/your-user-name/the-name-of-the-hard-drive.  This is true of USB drives as well as internal hard drives.  If you open up Files and then click on \"Computer\" in the left sidebar, that will bring you to the root of your computer (/), so try to click on media, your username, and the the name of the hard drive to figure out exactly what the full path to your drive is.\nNow that you know the full path of your external drive, you should be able to use it to install programs using apt-get.

When I open a Chines web page, for example, this in Firefox, I got all crazy symbols. How to ask Firefox to display Chinese correctly, please? Could anyone provide a step by step guide, please? Thank you!\n\nA: That particular web page is the problem. If you check the source (Ctrl+U), the only character set (charset) encoding specified is GB2312. Firefox won't detect it automatically.\nNowadays, most web sites intended for international viewing should use Unicode (UTF-8) for compatibility. For example, if you check:\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/\nyou should see normal Chinese text. If you check the source (Ctrl+U), near the top of the page you will see:\ncharset=utf-8\nIn Firefox, you can select a different character encoding in the View menu. You would have to check those listed as Chinese to see if the text is legible.\n", "Q: No Desktop appear after logged in using lightdm Ubuntu 14.04 Guest Logged in working fine...But When i do logging with my user account..logged in gets successful but after logged in ..nothing appears on desktop except wallpaper of ubuntu.\nFacing this problem from so many days.\n\nA: Open your terminal or login into tty2 (by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2) and go to home folder by using command cd ~ .\nDelete files with the command rm as shown bellow.

If you did not have it set up during install, it will tell you via terminal and instruct you on how to set it up.\nExample: \"Please recompile the kernel module and install it by: sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup   \n\nBefore you run the setup for the virtualbox drive, you will need to have the 3.10.18 linux kernel installed, as the setup will fail telling you the kernel cannot be found without it. You can learn how to install this kernel via http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/11/install-linux-kernel-3-10-18-ubuntu-mint/\nAfter you have installed the kernel and restarted, you may run the vboxdrv setup command shown earlier and test if virtualbox works via command line.

I'll appreciate if you give me the steps, because honestly I'm an average user who is really nervous on this thing. \n\nA: Yes. That makes no sense in Ubuntu. Open the partitioner, shrink the D: partition and install Ubuntu on the freed space. \n\nA: (dropped down from comments so I could use a picture)\nHere is a picture from the Windows partitioning tool of the partitions on a pc.  Take a look at the middle drive (Windows calls it G).  My Ubuntu partition is the 482 G partition on that drive, the 3rd one.  If I shrank the first partition on that drive, the 1374 G one, I couldn't expand my Ubuntu partition into it, because there is a little 200M partition in the way.  I'd have to move that and it would get complicated.  Bottom line, the 1374 G and 482G partitions are not adjacent so shrinking one will not help me expand the other without jumping through a bunch of other hoops.\nBut on the bottom drive, the E and F partitions are adjacent.  If I shrink one it's easy to expand the other into the newly freed space because they touch each other.\nALWAYS BACK UP YOUR DATA FIRST.

Often I have a shell open already and I notice the software updater is telling me there are updates. To save me the time on extra mouse clicks, I want to just update via the shell. But if I just do \"sudo apt-get update\", the software updater still shows me pending updates and this is also the case even after rebooting the system - if I'm not mistaken.\nSo, if I want to do the same thing as the software updater in the shell, what commands do I have to call?\nsudo apt-get update?\nsudo apt-get upgrade?\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade?\nAll of them?\n\nA: apt-get update only refreshes the available packages lists. apt-get upgrade does the actual upgrade. apt-get dist-upgrade, unlike apt-get upgrade has the ability to install or delete packages (that's what the GUI call an \"intelligent upgrade\". Normally, since dependencies aren't supposed to change during a release's lifecycle, for day-to-day upgrades, apt-get update followed by apt-get upgrade is enough. You should run apt-get dist-upgrade only when some packages are held back.\nAll that (and far more) is explained in apt-get manual page (man apt-get).\n", "Q: Disable Clutter (Top and Sidebar) on external Monitor I want to user my Ubuntu computer during a show.

However, the top panel will appear on all screens. If you run something in full screen mode on the display where you wish to hide the top panel though, it will be hidden by the full screen window.

Is it software that can be installed from the installation disk or something, and if so then would you need to insert the installation disk to get the software off it? And if not, then what is it, and what is it's purpose?\n\nA: Yes, that just includes the installation disk as a repository. It is useful primarily when you don't have internet access or you just don't want to download stuff (a slow connection perhaps). Presumably, it just adds a line like \n /cdrom/::\"/media/cdrom\" \"Ubuntu Installation CD\";\n\nto /etc/apt/sources.list. I'm not entirely sure about the format. This all used to be done manually but I haven't done it in years and couldn't find much about it. These days, the way to add a cdrom is by using apt-cdrom which is, again presumably, what that GUI will run in the background.\nIt is currently unticked because having it there would give an error every time you run apt-get update and the installation CD is not mounted. There is little point in having it unless you really need to use the CD instead of the public repositories. In general, assuming a decent internet connection, you should never use it since the versions in the repository will be updated and patched for security fixes while those on the CD will remain static for ever.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Installation on acer altos G520 I got an old server and I'm trying to install Ubuntu from USB.\nEverything is fine till I selected Ubuntu Live or Ubuntu installation.

That way you don't have to worry about any desktop or graphical settings, it'll be valid for 6 years (unlike 14.10) and you manage it remotely from an Ubuntu Desktop.\n", "Q: required hardware upgrade for old system I want to use Ubuntu 14.04.I do not wish to opt for lightweight versions so I need help in determining some reasonable hardware upgrades so I can use Ubuntu comfortably. Currently my system specs are as follows:\n1)512mb of ram. Can be increased not more than 2 GB (would that be enough?)\n2)No graphics card (would it be required?)\n3)Processor is pentium 4\n4)Speed is 2ghz.\n\nA: I've done this task before starting with a Pentium 4 computer that had 512MB RAM and no graphics card. I don't believe that a Pentium 4 computer can run Ubuntu 14.04 satisfactorily, so I downloaded Xubuntu 14.04 32-bit. I also added another 512MB of RAM. I could have used two 1GB RAM sticks instead, but I added only one 512MB RAM stick because it was what I had available at the time.\nI installed Xubuntu and a few more apps, and when I tested the installation the performance was OK, including Firefox, so this is what I am recommending. \nCompare prices before you buy RAM. You may find that adding to the RAM you already have is much cheaper than buying a new set of RAM sticks. Take an old RAM stick with you when you go to buy the RAM, so you can be sure that you are getting the type of RAM that is compatible with your motherboard.\n", "Q: What can I do with a cache SSD? I have a Lenovo U410 with a 1TB HDD (ST1000LM024 HN-M101MBB) and a cache SSD (SanDisk SSD U100 24GB). I want to install Ubuntu 14.04 as the only operating system. I'm currently looking into the right way to use and partition the two drives.\nI'm currently using a dual-boot system with Windows 8 where the Ubuntu partition uses 16GB on the HDD for the installation and has a different drive in common with Windows 8 for the home folder. I have found this 16GB to be on the limit since I have a lot of software installed. I therefore don't want to use the SSD for Ubuntu and have only the home folder on the HDD: just to be sure I won't run out of memory.\nNow what are my options?\n\n\n*\n\n*Everything on HDD but home on SSD, as suggested here? I could have large files in a data partition of the hard disk, but configuration files of /home on the SSD.\n\n*The operating system on SSD, but /swap, /usr and /home on HDD, as suggested here?\n\n*Perhaps only have the system use the SSD to boot fast (if that's possible?)?\n\n*Other options...?\n\n\nAnd then there is this post which says I shouldn't trust a cache SSD as it's not intended to be reliable. Is that true? Is there a way to check if my cache SSD is suitable to run the OS or hold the home folder?\n\nA: Since I wanted to focus on fast booting and starting programs, I decided to try the following:\nSSD: OS installation, /usr and /opt for programs\nHDD: /swap, /var, /home\nI decided to have /var on the HDD as well because I have rather big databases in the /var/lib/mysql and also my /var/www is quite spacious.\nSo far this is working fine. Booting and starting programs is incredibly fast. If I experience any problems with the SSD in the future I will update this post. So your safest bet is to have a look at the timestamp: if this post is old enough and I didn't edit it, you can assume I didn't have any problems.\n", "Q: Error while unzipping: need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6) I am getting this error while unzipping a file how unzip it \nc0mrad3@dinp:~/output/zip$ unzip 00000018.zip \nArchive:  00000018.zip\n   skipping: secret.txt              need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6)\n\n\nA: Try installing 7z sudo apt-get install p7zip-full and then extract the file with it 7z x 00000018.zip\n", "Q: OpenStack in VM player Hello guys I'm looking for some help or pointers on using ubuntu maas.\nI'm running my master node in a vm and I want to tried and add more virtual nodes to my cluster, however when I try to add the node it does not appear in the cluster.\nI had found a good link but I'm using a different laptop atm and was hoping that someone could point me in the right direction.\nThanks, Leprejohn\n\nA: Perhaps this is what you found:\nhttps://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/01/15/virtualbox-extensions-for-maas/\nMore generally speaking, you'll need to set up your virtual networks with careful consideration for DHCP & DNS as mentioned in that post and in the MAAS docs.\n", "Q: libc6 for g++ is installed but it says: NO!

I had version 2.19-0ubuntu6.6 which was slightly higher than the official repository version and which also set the required version for g++ to  2.19-0ubuntu6.6, which wasn't available. I might have added the higher versioned libc6 from some ppa, but I can't remember.\nI asked whether I should try to remove libc6, but it seems the package is at the very very core of the Linux system, and it's impossible to remove. And if removed forcefully, the system will stop working normally, so removing libc6 really isn't an option.\nThis question might be useful which is about downgrading a package by explicitly passing a version number\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install specific Ubuntu packages, with exact version?\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 14.04 boots into blank screen After installing Ubuntu Server 14.04.2 LTS without any errors I tried to boot into my PC and then I just got to a blank screen with a blinking underscore. There was no input except for CTRL + ALT + DEL which restarted the computer (as far as I have tested).\nMy mother board is ASUS - P9X79 WS.\nI have a NVIDIA Graphics card (Don't remember the product name, but I've read that NVIDIA or AMD Graphic cards can cause the black screen problem)\nI am not using any dual boot.\nI have tried tampering around with the boot settings quite a lot, CMS, Secure boot, AHCI, etc.\nI can get everything to work and boot into the system if I enter BIOS and boot into Generic Flash Drive (without UEFI) the monitor goes into standby for like 5 seconds then goes on and just shows a black screen for another 5 seconds and then I am presented with the login screen for Ubuntu Server. (I never saw any sign of GRUB or some sort of start up output).\nThe flash disk I used was the installation disk, but I don't really know if it would matter if I would use a random disk and boot from it because there seems to be no sign of any kind of interface.\nI really don't understand how this worked but it did, but it isn't a long term solution because I can't restart the server remotely, and I need to enter bios and selecting Generic Flash Drive each time. (Changing the boot order did not work).\nIf I boot into the USB Disk with UEFI I get to the Ubuntu Server installation/recovery menu.\n\nA: It sounds like you've installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode but your computer is configured to boot in EFI/UEFI mode by default. The easiest solution is to enter your firmware and reconfigure it to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode by default. Unfortunately, I can't give you exact step-by-step instructions because the procedure to make this change varies from one computer to another. You've clearly already activated BIOS/CSM/legacy support, but you may need to change the boot order or disable EFI/UEFI support to get the behavior you want.\nAnother approach is to install whatever EFI boot loader for Linux appeals to you. Ubuntu uses GRUB2 by default (for both BIOS and EFI), and you can install that by running Boot Repair; however, it's best if you do this from EFI mode, which means you'll need to boot an emergency system into EFI mode or boot your installed system in EFI mode in some other way. You can do the latter with a USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. If you like rEFInd, you could install it to your hard disk via dpkg or the PPA; it would then take over from GRUB. Given your setup, installing any EFI boot loader might require you to create an EFI System Partition (ESP); it's not clear if you've got one.\nIn the future, be aware that most modern computers support both BIOS-mode booting (via the CSM) and EFI-mode booting. This flexibility is useful in some cases, but it can also lead to problems such as the one you're experiencing. IMHO, it's usually best to disable the CSM (aka legacy-mode support). This will force an EFI-mode boot of the Ubuntu installer, which will then install an EFI-mode version of GRUB. Closing off the BIOS/CSM/legacy boot options makes it less likely that you'll have problems of this sort. The downside is that a lot of tools for creating Ubuntu install disks don't write EFI boot loaders by default; you've got to use either dd (to copy the image file straight to disk) or an EFI-aware tool for creating your boot media. If you decide to re-install Ubuntu, I recommend doing so in EFI mode.\n\nA: When you boot, you are always taken into the GUI terminal. Unfortunately, this varies from one computer to another. \nOne way of experimenting with this is try installing the desktop\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\nIf this works, then the problem is that your computer takes you by default to GUI terminal on booting.\nPress CTRL+ALT+F1. This will take you to command-line terminal.\n\nA: Ubuntu server is a non gui OS (only terminal window OS), it doesn't have windows, for your computer you must install Ubuntu desktop.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nscroll down and download version 14.10 64 bit version.\n\nA: With 14.04 installed from USB drive I noticed the installer installs GRUB on sda which is the USB (installer) drive. The hard drive is sdb during install. So boot the machine with the USB drive and do a grub repair on the hard drive. Now the system will boot without the USB drive. 16.04 now gives you the option of choosing what drive Grub gets installed to.\n", "Q: Abort class-pclzip.php : Missing zlib extensions Since I recovered from some mess that I was having after upgrading my Ubuntu server to 14.04, the two Wordpress websites that I have hosted on the server have been randomly displaying the following error message upon opening:\nAbort class-pclzip.php : Missing zlib extensions\n\nThe strange thing is that a refresh gets rid of the message.

That means that if you want to run it by double-clicking from an icon, you'd need to create a .desktop file, in which is defined to run the script inside a terminal window. \nThese .desktop files are part of practically all GUI applications installed on Ubuntu by the way.\nA very basic example, fit for your script:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Test\nExec=/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test.py\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\n\nThe most interesting lines are:\nExec=/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test.py\n\nin which the command to run your script is defined. \nRead more on how to create the command, the script being executable or not, using the shebang, language extension, see here.\nand the line:\nTerminal=true\n\nThat says the script needs to be run in a terminal window.\nYou can extend your .desktop file with a.o. an icon and a lot more options, depending on what you are using it for exactly, see here.\n\n*How to use the .desktop file\n\n\n*\n\n*Paste the code above in an empty file, save it as test.desktop. Edit the command in the line Exec=/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test.py, according to the link I added to create commands to run a script.\n\n*If you use the file from your desktop, make it executable with the command:\nchmod +x /path/to/Test.desktop\n\nAlternatively, you can copy (move) the .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications to make it available in Dash. Globally installed applications store their .desktop files in /usr/share/applications. In the last two directories, there is no need to make the .desktop file executable.\nAbout the example lines you don't understand\n\n\n*\n\n*The lines:\n#!/usr/local/bin/python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nare shebangs; the first line of a script, telling the shell how to run it if the script is executable, and you run it without python before the path to the script. Since you use python3, the shebang in your scripts should normally be:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nMore on this, and the relation between shebang and command in the link above.\n\n*CHMOD X (?) chmod +x is probably what you mean. As explained above, you can make a file executable with the command:\nchmod +x /path/to/file\n\n\nA: As mentioned by others, chmod +x is necessary to make the program executable. For example for the program hello.py, you'd enter this in the terminal:\n$ chmod +x hello.py \nNow, don't know if it's true in former releases, but in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS it's necessary that the behavior of the icons be set to allow clicking on the icon to execute the program. You can do this in the following way:\nGo to a file browser window, then move mouse cursor to the top of the screen and select edit > preferences > behavior, then select either 'Run executable text files when they are opened' or 'Ask each time'. \nAlso, to keep the terminal from closing at the end of the program (for example if you want to keep output of the program to the terminal on the screen), in python3.5 you need to put this line at the end of the program:\ninput()\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Write a .bat file, which runs under command prompt.In the file, write just one line like:\nC:/Python/Python38/python.exe c:/MyProject/mainFile.py\nWhere, C:/Python/Python38/python.exe is Python 3.8, and c:/MyProject/mainFile.py is the python script file to be executed.\nCreate a shortcut of the .bat file and place it on Windows screen as an icon. That is it.\n", "Q: Wifi stop working after while on Ubuntu 14.04.2 Yesterday I bought new laptop Lenovo E540 and I installed here Ubuntu 14.04.2.

On a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04, I get this error message during boot\n\nthe disk drive for /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 is not ready yet or not present\n\nand the swap partition is never activated. From my searches so far I have found:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is a widespread problem, probably affecting every Ubuntu 14.04 install on which encrypted swap was activated.\n\n*Part of the problem is an easy to fix bug causing the encrypted swap header (generated during boot) to overwrite the unencrypted swap header, which makes it impossible to find the correct partition again during the next boot.\n\n*All the proposed solutions to get it work appears to be simply workarounds amounting to: 1. Disable swap by setting it as noauto in fstab. 2. Create an /etc/rc.local file (or define your own service to be activated during boot), which activates the swap partition.\n\n\nIs it possible to use encrypted swap on Ubuntu 14.04 without using this sort of hack? I am perfectly comfortable updating all the installed packages and fix those configuration files, which got initialized with incorrect content due to buggy install scripts. I'd rather avoid having to use my own script to activate swap, as that sort of approach have a tendency to break when packages are updated.\nThis is what my /etc/crypttab looks like:\ncryptswap1 /dev/sda6 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256,offset=16\n\nAnd the relevant line from my /etc/fstab is:\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\nI have found message disk drive for /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 is not ready yet or not present even after trying various options asking about what might be the same scenario.\nBut the only answer is suggesting to using un-encrypted swap.\nI have found http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2200995 which claims to have a solution, but the solution makes no sense to me.\nThe first part of the proposed solution is to rewrite the encrypted swap header using mkswap. However since this header is encrypted with a key, that is not persistent across reboots, this step wouldn't help getting the swap working after the next reboot.\nIt also suggests updates to /etc/fstab, but it appears my fstab is already looking correctly.\nThe post assumes LVM, which I do not use. I am unaware of any way, that would make a difference.\nI have found https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ecryptfs-utils/+bug/1310058 which helped me understand the issue with the swap header being overwritten and that adding offset to crypttab and regenerating the unencrypted swap header, can resolve this problem.\nHowever the overwritten header is not the only issue at play, there is another issue, which I do not fully understand yet.\nOther things I have found out about the problem:\nFrom reading /lib/cryptsetup/cryptdisks.functions I learned that during boot, the device is supposed to be created using the name cryptswap1_unformatted then the encrypted swap header is to be written, and the device is to be renamed as cryptswap1. In the kernel log I find this error message:\n[   39.419429] device-mapper: ioctl: Unable to change name on mapped device cryptswap1_unformatted to one that already exists: cryptswap1\n\nConfusingly the outcome of that turns out to be that the device does end up having the name cryptswap1, but the swap header never got written.\nSwap works during those boots where a file system check was performed. It is only when no file system checks is performed, that I get the dreaded cryptswap1 is not ready yet error.\nIn /var/log/upstart/cryptdisks.log I find the error message\nDevice cryptswap1_unformatted already exists.\n\nHowever by adding some additional logging to /lib/cryptsetup/cryptdisks.functions, I learned that there is a race between /etc/init.d/cryptdisks-early and /etc/init/cryptdisks.conf. Any logging I add to cryptdisks.functions can influence how the actions of the two scripts are interleaved, and occasionally, it ends up working.\nIt is clear that the two are not supposed to be handling the same device in parallel. How can I get the two scripts serialized, such that swap works on every boot?\n\nA: There are two separate problems which must be resolved in order to get cryptswap1 working correctly in Ubuntu 14.04.\nProblem 1: Overwritten swap header\nThe partition has originally been formatted with an unencrypted swap header, which is used to find the correct partition to use during boot. Because the encryption key changes at each boot, the encrypted swap header will be rewritten at each boot. Due to a bug in generation of /etc/crypttab, the encrypted swap header overwrites the unencrypted swap header. This will prevent the swap partition from being found at all future boots.\nProblem 2: Race condition during boot\nThere is a race condition during boot between /etc/init.d/cryptdisks-early and /etc/init/cryptdisks.conf. Both will simultaneously try to activate all devices listed in crypttab. In the case of encrypted swap, the outcome of the race condition most of the time will be, that it doesn't work at all. Some sanity check fails causing writing of the encrytped swap header to be skipped in order to prevent potential data loss.\nFixing and working around the problems\nThe first problem can easily be fixed. The second can be worked around. In /etc/crypttab identify the swap line. It should look like this (except that the UUID will be different):\ncryptswap1 UUID=f9a0f20c-fac4-408c-a8b9-47300216f727 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nIn my case this was the only line in /etc/crypttab. To fix the overwriting of the swap header, an offset must be added. Sources disagree on what exactly the correct value to use is, but using a too large value doesn't hurt. I got it working using an offset of 16.\nAdditionally I added noearly which causes /etc/init.d/cryptdisks-early to ignore this line and that way works around the race condition.\nThe resulting line looks like:\ncryptswap1 UUID=f9a0f20c-fac4-408c-a8b9-47300216f727 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256,offset=16,noearly\n\nThis will prevent the unencrypted swap header from being overwritten again, but we still need to recreate it on the partition. At this step it is crucial to use the correct partition because using the wrong partition will cause data loss. I used fdisk -l to find the correct partition, which in my case is /dev/sda6.\nNow use mkswap to rewrite the unencrypted swap header.\nmkswap /dev/sda6 -U f9a0f20c-fac4-408c-a8b9-47300216f727\n\nThe UUID is the one the swap partition had before it was overwritten (which you can still see in /etc/crypttab). Once this is done a reboot is needed, and it should all work.\nVerifying correct operation\nI recommend rebooting three times to verify that it keeps working.\nThe error message the disk drive for /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 is not ready yet or not present remains visible briefly during boot. This appears not to be a problem though, as it does become ready before the boot process completes.\nLog in and type cat /proc/swaps to see that swap is active. You should see a swap partition with the name /dev/dm-0 where dm indicates that it is indeed using the device mapper layer, which provides the encryption.\n", "Q: Can Connect to OpenVPN but no internet access I have set up an openvpn server, generated a certificate and downloaded it to my client machine.\nAfter importing the client.ovpn file in the network manager, I can still ssh into the server itself, but cannot access the internet.\nIn my sever's openvpn server.conf, I have:\n push \"redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp\"\n push \"dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222\"\n push \"dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220\"\n\nall uncommented.\nIn the global sysctl.conf file I also have:\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\nIs there anything I am missing configuration wise?

I don't know what it adds to the frequently-referenced Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (UEFI Supported). Furthermore, I STRONGLY disagree with a key part of this procedure: Step #3 changes the boot mode from EFI/UEFI to BIOS/CSM/legacy. This is a mistake, which is corrected later in the procedure, in steps #6-8. It's almost always better to install Ubuntu directly in EFI mode. Doing so will obviate the need to fix GRUB, since it will be set up correctly in the first place.\nSome people seem to have trouble getting the Ubuntu installer to boot in EFI mode. I suspect that most of these problems are caused by creating an Ubuntu boot medium in weird ways. In this context, \"weird\" means anything but using dd to copy the raw image to a USB flash drive, or cdrecord or similar tools to burn a CD-R. This page doesn't recommend anything specific for that, so it's unclear what the author used. Tools like Pen Drive Linux and Unetbootin work by copying files to the target medium. Most such tools were written before EFI became common, and older versions don't create the right EFI boot files. Even some newer versions require activating special options that aren't set by default to create an EFI-bootable image. The bottom line is that these tools might or might not create an EFI-bootable drive, depending on what tool you use, what version of said tool you're using, and what options you select.\nThat said, even copying an image with dd is not 100% guaranteed to work. It usually does work, but these images are Frankenstein monsters; they're created to work on both USB flash drives and CD-Rs, and to be bootable under both BIOS and EFI. This is done by laying things down in an unusual way, which usually works or sometimes causes problems. Thus, if you can't get a dd-created image to boot, you might have to resort to some other tool; but if you do, you should carefully examine options to find the ones that will create an EFI-bootable image.\nFor more on this topic, see my Web page on installing Linux under EFI. It's really not that hard, although there are potential pitfalls that can trap the unwary.\n\nA: You could also enter this in the grub, and this is after you installed Ubuntu, and on a pre installed Windows 8, and it is enter in this producer after menu entry enter this:\nset default to this:   2/default=\nand this after menu entry of windows 8.\n  if   fi   fi-uuidf   set root=ext4\n\nand after echo this:\n uuidf /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/MokManager.efi\n\nand it might work also.\n", "Q: Can't create custom screen resolution, and terminals are inaccessible I have a second monitor plugged in by a DVI to VGA converter.

So i would like to allocate all the memory possible to ubuntu. I read everywhere that it is needed to shrink C to install ubuntu. So i will have freespace from C. But what about D? If it is empty and i would like also allocate it to Linux. How can i be sure to do it? What about other partitions? E.g. this EFI partition, do i need or maybe i can delete this partition to allocate to ubuntu as well? Would be great to have your advices! Thank you!\n\nA: I just dual booted Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04. I created recovery DVDs and then simply deleted the D drive, shrank C, and proceeded to use the empty space to create a regular partition (and a swap space) for Ubuntu. I did not mess with the EFI or the other partitions, so I can't tell you exactly what will happen with those, but since those come before the C drive, you might want to leave them alone. (I ran into problems when Windows was occupying partitions that were not right next to each other--not sure if Ubuntu will have the same issues.) \n", "Q: Install Ubuntu onto an SSD with Windows on another SSD I recently got a new SSD (512GB Samsung 850 EVO) to replace my old one (128GB Samsung 830). My intention is either to partition the new SSD into two 256GB partitions and to install Windows 7 on one side and Ubuntu on the other. Or I would install Windows on all 512GB of the new SSD, and use the old one for Ubuntu. I also have a 3TB HDD that I would like to separate out for use by the two OS (2TB for Windows, 1TB for Ubuntu).\nI'm new to installing and using Ubuntu, are there any good tutorials for doing so? Furthermore, are there any viable alternatives to a native install, such as visualization? What kind of performance impact does virtualization incur compared to a native install? My CPU (3570K) has vt-x, but not vt-d.\nThanks.\n\nA: Virtualization can have an impact on running the regular Ubuntu desktop (Unity) or Ubuntu Gnome but is more unnoticeable when using Xubuntu, Lubuntu, or Ubuntustudio. One key thing is you must enable 3D acceleration when running regular Ubuntu or Ubuntu Gnome. Of course, there is almost always an impact when running virt. compared to the real thing but Ubuntu/Linux runs much better than say OSX does in Virtualbox.\n\nHere is a good link to a tutorial for SSD optimization.\nNotably, they show how to change options to noatime and how to set the scheduler to noop as well as removing an unnecessary cron job, all to reduce SSD wear and tear.\n\nAlso, I also suggest using zram swap to reduce SSD use from swapiness. Basically, after installation, open a terminal and run the following command to create a new file:\nsudo nano /etc/init.d/zram\n\nthen, copy and paste the following into the terminal:\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides:          zram\n# Required-Start:    $local_fs\n# Required-Stop:     $local_fs\n# Default-Start:     S\n# Default-Stop:      0 1 6\n# Short-Description: Use compressed RAM as in-memory swap\n# Description:       Use compressed RAM as in-memory swap\n### END INIT INFO\n\n# Author: Antonio Galea <antonio.galea@gmail.com>\n# Thanks to Przemysław Tomczyk for suggesting swapoff parallelization\n\nFRACTION=75\n\nMEMORY=`perl -ne'/^MemTotal:\\s+(\\d+)/ && print $1*1024;' < /proc/meminfo`\nCPUS=`grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo`\nSIZE=$(( MEMORY * FRACTION / 100 / CPUS ))\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  \"start\")\n    param=`modinfo zram|grep num_devices|cut -f2 -d:|tr -d ' '`\n    modprobe zram $param=$CPUS\n    for n in `seq $CPUS`; do\n      i=$((n - 1))\n      echo $SIZE > /sys/block/zram$i/disksize\n      mkswap /dev/zram$i\n      swapon /dev/zram$i -p 10\n    done\n    ;;\n  \"stop\")\n    for n in `seq $CPUS`; do\n      i=$((n - 1))\n      swapoff /dev/zram$i && echo \"disabled disk $n of $CPUS\" &\n    done\n    wait\n    sleep .5\n    modprobe -r zram\n    ;;\n  *)\n    echo \"Usage: `basename $0` (start | stop)\"\n    exit 1\n    ;;\nesac\n\nWhen you are done, press CTRL + O and press Enter to save the file and then press CTRL + X to exit the file.\nFinally, run the following three commands in an open terminal to apply zram swap compression:\nFirst, make the file executable:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/zram\n\nThen, start zram swap compression:\nsudo /etc/init.d/zram start\n\nFinally, the following command will make it start automatically at boot time.\nsudo update-rc.d zram defaults\n\nsources:\nhttp://command-line-computer-virus.tumblr.com/tagged/swappiness\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/ZRam\n\nA: That other answer was great, but here's what I'd do.\nI'd install Windows on one SSD and Ubuntu on the other and use the 3TB drive for storage for both. There's no reason it can't be NTFS and be drive D: in windows and /downloads in Ubuntu. The easiest way to do that is to declare it when you're installing Ubuntu (during partitioning). Ubuntu can read NTFS so you can have all your files in one place.  (Fewer partitions is usually better)\nVirtualization is awesome, tho the guest OS goes a little slow. There's absolutely no reason you can't do both.\n", "Q: kill process with htop Sometimes I need to kill a process and for that purpose I enter htop, search (/) for some string and then intend to kill the associated process.\nThe problem is that usually the processes are in motion (due to new processes being added and attributes changing) - so by the time I pressed F9 and went on with \"killing\" the process the selected process is already a different one.\nIs there a way to handle this?\nThe reason why I use htop is of course b/c I sometimes have to guess which is the right process to get rid of and just a string is not sufficient for identification.\n\nA: use htop and note down the PID of the process.\nExit by entering q\nthen enter the command :\nkill PID\n\nIf it is owned by the root, then :\nsudo kill PID\n\nHope this'll help you ....\n\nA: After executing sudo htop, just use the arrow keys to select the process you want to remove and then press either F9 or k then select which signal you want to send in the list (using the arrow keys) and press enter.\nIf you just to ask \"politely\" a process to quit use 3 SIGQUIT.\nIf you want to make sure the process quits use 9 SIGKILL.\n\nA: First, press F6 which is the \"sort by\" option.\nThen, under the \"sort by\" category on the left, select option PID and then press Enter. This should give you a more stable output.\nNext, to locate a process, press F3 to search, type in the search, and then press F3 again to scroll through search results.\nWhen the process is highlighted, press F9 two times quickly and then press 9 and then press Enter to kill the process.\n\nA: It is possible to tag (and untag) a process with [space]. To the tagged process(es) the kill signal will be sent.\n", "Q: I need help mounting an lvm2 partition with 14.04 LTS live USB SOLUTION: I was able to mount the partition and copy the files to another drive!\nsudo fuseext2 -o ro -o allow_other /dev/mapper/vg1-lg1 /mnt\n\nwas the key.

I found the partition with gparted - listed as /dev/sdb8, but I can't get it to mount. It has stuff on it (pictures/movies/etc) that I don't want to lose, so I don't want to just wipe it.\nSo far, I have tried to update/install lvm2 with apt-get - it tells me that is on the newest version.

The last one needs 2 machines: the \"sniffing machine\" that sniffs the network that the other machine is connected to.  Also, you need to enable a monitor port on your switch (a.k.a. \"mirroring port\" or \"SPAN\" port) or use an old-style HUB.\nThe last one will allow you to follow the entire path of the packet (which is what your question is about)\nFor further information, read the manuals of the respective tools otherwise you will be like a kid trying to figure out an old-fashioned phone!  >:-)\n", "Q: I should have 20GB of swap space, but I apparently have no swap space at all When I installed Ubuntu I set aside about 20GB for my swap space.

As long as you don't use hibernate, this will be OK though, but the best choice would be to allocate a swap partition for each OS.\n", "Q: UBUNTU server java 8 installation error how to install java 8  in ubuntu server 32 bit ??\nsudo apt-get install oacle-java8-installation\n\nThis is working in UBUNTU desktop version 64 bit but not in UBUNTU server version 32 bit\n\nA: Try this command (it's different from the one in your question):\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer   \n\nIf you haven't already added the Oracle Java Installer PPA, you have to do that first.

You either login with nvidia or intel.\nI have had problems with bumblebee since 13.10. What works for me now is nvidia-prime. This allows you to choose which graphics driver you want to use in the nvidia control panel. This only works with lightdm (unity). I'm using this myself on Ubuntu 14.04\nHow to install\n1. Use nvidia driver\nOpen the dash (super/windows key) and type in \"drivers\". Open \"Aditional drivers\"\nSelect the nvidia binary (331.xx) driver.\n\nClick \"apply changes\". Wait for the driver to be downloaded and installed, and click close.\n2. Remove bumblebee and install prime\nOpen the shell by pressing ctrl-alt-t.\nFirst let's make sure we have the latest software catalog.\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow remove everything bumblebee related.\nsudo apt-get purge bumblebee*\n\nThen install prime.\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-prime\n\nNow restart your computer.\nHow to use prime\nAfter your computer has restarted, open the dash and type \"nvidia\". Open \"Nvidia x-server settings\".\n\nHere you can choose between the intel and nvidia graphics driver. Choose the intel one for maximum power saving, choose the nvidia one for maximum performance.\nAfter changing graphics card, you'll have to logout and log back in to apply the changes.\nDifference between nvidia-prime and bumblebee\nThe current version of nvidia-prime uses one graphics card for the complete desktop. You either login with nvidia or intel. With bumblebee, you can start individual programs with a specific graphics card, like it is the case on windows.\nSadly, I can't get bumblebee to work on ubuntu 13.10 or higher...\n\nA: If you want to select a specific GPU for the entire session, then selecting it with Prime, logging out and then logging back in will suffice.\nHowever, if you really want to choose which GPU to use for each application, then you must use the DRI_PRIME environment variable for such specific application(s) instead of using the system-wide Prime setting.\nIdeally, it's recommended to use the Prime program in order to preset the integrated GPU (graphics processing unit) as the default (system-wide) one, i.e. it's recommended to set the integrated Intel graphics card as the default one, because it saves power, helps keeping your computer operating at a lower temperature et cetera. Then when you decide to run that very demanding 3D appplication, you use DRI_PRIME to tell the system that it must use your Nvidia GPU to run such specific application.\nAs explained e.g. here and here, once you've used Prime to \"tell\" the system that your integrated Intel GPU is the default one to be used system-wide, you tell your Nvidia GPU to run the specific application by running the command:\nDRI_PRIME=1 specific-application\n\n...where specific-application is e.g. a 3D modelling application or a 3D game or any other program that requires a GPU with more powerful graphics processing capabilities. If e.g. you want your Nvidia GPU to process the graphics of the Inkscape application, just run:\nDRI_PRIME=1 inkscape\n\nIn order to run Blender using your Nvidia GPU instead of the integrated Intel GPU, just run:\nDRI_PRIME=1 blender\n\nSuppose that you want Blender to always use your Nvidia GPU instead of the integrated Intel GPU. In such case, you may use a text editor (such as GEdit, Nano, Mousepad, Leafpad etc.) in order to edit Blender's .desktop file:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/blender.desktop\n\n...and then replace this:\nExec=/usr/bin/blender %u\n\n...with this:\nExec=DRI_PRIME=1 /usr/bin/blender %u\n\n...then just save the file, exit the text editor and start Blender by clicking on its icon at the Applications menu. Each one of those application icons at the Applications menu are one .desktop file, so if you modify e.g. blender.desktop you're pretty much modifying the Blender application shortcut at your Applications menu so when you click on such shortcut it runs Blender with DRI_PRIME set as 1 (i.e. use the Nvidia GPU to run Blender).\nIn case you don't know which is the current default GPU, run this command:\nglxinfo | grep \"OpenGL renderer\"\n\nAnd in order to see which GPU is activated when you set DRI_PRIME=1, run this command:\nDRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo | grep \"OpenGL renderer\"\n\nIf your integrated Intel GPU is already set as the default (system-wide) GPU, then the first command (glxinfo | grep \"OpenGL renderer\") will inform you that Intel is the GPU ran by glxinfo by default, and the second command (DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo | grep \"OpenGL renderer\") will inform you that Nvidia is the GPU ran by DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo (i.e. Nvidia is not the default / system-wide GPU, but DRI_PRIME=1 successfully set Nvidia as the active GPU for that specific process initiated by DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo | grep \"OpenGL renderer\").\n\nA: After some trial and error I discovered that you need to append the following two lines to the .desktop file of the app you want to use the dgpu by default.\nPrefersNonDefaultGPU=true\nX-KDE-RunOnDiscreteGpu=true\n\nIt will then give you the option to launch using the integrated gpu instead of the discrete one. For the command linen run the following command, it will make a script called prime-run which you can call from the command line, for example opening gedit on the dgpu would be prime-run gedit.\nHere is the command.\necho \"sudo apt-get install -y sed\necho \\\"#/bin/bash\nexport __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1\nexport __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia\nexport __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only\nexport VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json\nexec \\\\\\\"\\\\\\$@\\\\\\\"\\\" >| /usr/bin/prime-run\nsed -i 's%#%#!%' /usr/bin/prime-run \" >| script.sh\nsudo chmod +x /usr/bin/prime-run\nsudo bash script.sh\nsudo rm script.sh\n\n", "Q: wlan1 interface disappeared from ifconfig I was trying to make a virtual interface on my wlan1 card (like set hostednetwork from windows) by editing /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto wlan1:0 \niface wlan1:0 inet static\naddress 192.168.4.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0 \nwireless-mode ad-hoc\n\nWhen that failed I have tried with ap-hotspot:\nsudo apt-get install ap-hotspot\ncd /tmp && wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wpa/hostapd_1.0-3ubuntu2.1_i386.deb && sudo dpkg -i hostapd*.deb && sudo apt-mark hold hostapd\nsudo ap-hotspot configure\n\nThat also failed.

In addition, if you add files or directories later within the directory, you have to make sure the group settings are correct (morph:testgroup), as long as testuser should have access to this new files. Of course you can add your own user to that group too.\nuseradd -G testgroup morph\n\nFurthermore I want to add, that as long as you are root on your system -- or as long as you can use sudo --, you don't have to be worried, because you can change back every standard file permissions, as long as they are not further protected by a specific MAC (media access control) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control) sytem like selinux.

What information (such as keys, passphrases, configuration etc.) should I keep in cold storage given the following setup?\nUbuntu root is installed on a LUKS-encrypted drive. I have a second HDD that is also LUKS-encrypted and is set up to automatically mount upon login. Additionally my home directory is mounted with ecryptfs.\nI know that for ecryptfs I should be storing the output of ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase, but what should be done for each of the LUKS partitions? I vaguely remember that there is some other passphrase that should be stored in case particular partition header information is corrupted.\nThanks for your help.

The header can be backed up to a file with cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup and restored with cryptsetup luksHeaderRestore. See man cryptsetup:\n\nluksHeaderBackup <device> --header-backup-file <file>\n\nStores a binary backup of the LUKS header and keyslot area.\nNote: Using '-' as filename writes the header backup to a file named '-'.\nWARNING:  This  backup  file and a passphrase valid at the time of backup allows decryption of the LUKS data area,\n                even if the passphrase was later changed or removed from the LUKS device. Also note that with a header backup  you\n                lose the ability to securely wipe the LUKS device by just overwriting the header and key-slots.

Or the other way around?\n\nIt seems obvious that the disks are not NTFS formatted, but I formatted them in Windows and checked the disks before I plugged them into the ubuntu environment - so definitly are NTFS.\nDoes anyone have an idea of how I can mount the RAID 0 disks?\n\nA: Both disks have partitions of type 4200 and 4201, which denote Microsoft Logical Disk Manager (LDM), which is Microsoft's equivalent to the Linux Logical Volume Manager (LVM). As such, you can't mount these partitions directly, because the filesystems they contain are held in containers within the partitions. The Linux kernel includes LDM support, but I don't recall offhand if that support is included in Ubuntu. If it is, you'll see device files for the logical volumes in the Linux /dev/mapper/ directory, or a subdirectory thereof. I recommend you check there. You clearly already know how to use blkid, so you can use it to identify NTFS volumes.\nOne more thing: You said these disks are RAID 0 devices. If this was set up with the motherboard's software RAID, you'll need to activate that support, as described here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto\nNote that the RAID devices are likely to show up in /dev/mapper, too. Using LDM on top of dmraid could get complex.

I suppose I can use VirtualBox to experiment. I know this is question is somewhat on the line, but I will try anyway.\n\nA: Linux Mint is a derivative of Ubuntu - it is based on the same packages, some of which have been replaced with new one to make a customized version. You can sort of see this by looking at the repositories list on it:\n\nThis is from the Live DVD - probably not much different to the installed version\nLooking at http://packages.linuxmint.com/list.php?release=Qiana it seems to be mainly cinnamon, Xfce, & Mate desktop mods along with some themes - though it probably influences some more system related things such as graphics drivers as Mint is supposed to have a more open approach to proprietary software.\n", "Q: Change name of executable file when using chmod +x I have python file my_script.py\nWhen I run:\nchmod +x my_script.py\n\nI end up with two files that are called my_script.py, one executable file and one python file, when I try to get the size of the file:\ndu -sh my_script.py\n\nI am getting the size of the python file (4.0K), but I want to know the size of the executable. \nIs there a way to change a name of the executable file? To something say my_script without .py ?\n\nA: There is only 1 file, my_script.py. Doing a simple chmod +x does NOT \"end up with two files called my_script.py\" (what would the 2nd my_script.py be called?).  \nSince Python is an interpreted language, you might want to consider the size of the python interpreter, and both the dynamic libraries and interpreted libraries it uses.  \nWhen the execve system call (see man 2 execve) notices that my_script.py is executable (has the x bit set), and begins with \"#!<interpreter>\" it runs <interpreter> my_script.py (interpreter> is probably /usr/bin/python in your case).\nSo, you can simply mv my_script.py my_script. Unlike that other operating system, Unix/Linux filenames do NOT govern how the files are executed.\n\nA: Execute this command to change name of file while making it executable.\nchmod +x my_script.py && mv my_script.py mv_myscript\n\n", "Q: The entire process of using xorg-edgers ppa? Proprietary drivers apparently generally outperform open-source Nouveau drivers. The stable packages offered by default repositories seem to be too behind the latest stable ones available from the website (which need time to be tested/packaged specifically for Ubuntu).\nMy question is, are these drivers reliable/safe to use? If proprietary drivers are better than Nouveau drivers, are the latest stable drivers for Linux from the website better than one the ones packaged specifically for Ubuntu which are behind by a few versions but which are tested for the OS?\nIf I am to use xorg-edgers PPA, I read that I need to disable the PPA right after installing the driver because it will continue pulling driver updates that could mess up with your trackpad, etc. Why does it do this (since a PPA is just a third-party repository--why does it do something a default repository wouldn't do)?\nIf I were to update the driver next time, I would just re-enable the PPA, install the driver, and disable the PPA?\nLastly, can someone explain this (under \"Importance Notice\" to me: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa?

Always use your own personal judgement and do some research before installing a PPA!

DO NOT USE apt-get. See at the bottom, \"Just reboot!\".\n\nHow did this happen? (previous long answer)\nExactly this kind of problem will arise if you:\n\n*\n\n*upgrade the kernel (say from .66 to .67)\n\n*run apt-get autoremove and somehow remove the running kernel, or manually remove the \"old\" kernel, thus removing all modules from /lib/modules/kernel.66\n\n*do not reboot, thereby keeping the \"old\" .66 kernel running. The loaded modules remain in memory and everything works, but no new modules can be loaded since .66 modules have been deleted.\n\n*try to do anything that requires loading a module that was not yet loaded\n\nAnd installing the VirtualBox ISO may require exactly that -- loading the ISO9660 support module.\nThe requested module now can no longer be autoloaded, because the running kernel (.66) does not find anything in /lib/modules/kernel.66 . The module exists, but it is in /lib/modules/kernel.67, of which the current .66 kernel knows nothing about (and it's not recommended to load a mismatching module).\nReinstalling the uname'd kernel will of course reinstall the running kernel modules, thereby making ../.66/.../isofs.ko available again and making a reboot unnecessary. This is a downgrade of the installed kernel and the update issue will remain (see below).\nThat is, when you run Additions CD, it will install for the running .66 kernel, not the updated .67 kernel (which still isn't running).\nIf you are in such a situation you can also certainly fix it by rebooting (the new .67 running kernel will find its modules), and probably by loading the module belonging to the new kernel (isofs is pretty stable), which unless you've underwent an important kernel upgrade will still be compatible (this is still not recommended!):\n# mount /dev/cdrom /mnt\nmount: unknown filesystem type 'iso9660'\n\nThis above is the root error you're getting (\"unknown filesystem type\").\n# uname -a\nLinux virtual 3.13.0-66-generic ...\n\nSo we check which version of the modules is installed. It should be .66:\n# ls /lib/modules\n3.13.0-67-generic\n\n...but there's only one directory and it's .67 (the .66 directory might be there, but empty; in this case du -sh /lib/modules/* will tell how much space is taken by the various directories, allowing to tell between empty ones and full ones).\nReinstalling the old kernel image with no re-grub will not fix the real problem\nYou reinstall the running kernel with its modules and headers. Now you have both kernels, with grub set to load the newer kernel.\nThe ISO CD-ROM can be mounted (because the module is now present) and the VBox modules will compile (because the headers have been installed).\nIt will compile modules for the running .66 kernel, and they will work... for a while.\nAt the first reboot, you will find yourself with a .67 kernel with no VirtualBox additions at all.\nReinstalling the kernel will also not fix the real problem\napt-get install --reinstall linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\nAs above, at the first reboot you will find yourself with a downgraded (or better \"not upgraded\") kernel. Very soon, Ubuntu will try to upgrade it... and you'll be back where you started (see below: \"downgrading kernel\"), and need to reboot and install Virtualbox Additions again.\nPatching in the ISO module will also not fix the real problem\nChances are we can force load the ISO9660 module all the same, since no work was done between kernels 66 and 67 and the binary is essentially unchanged, so we try:\n# insmod /lib/modules/3.13.0-67-generic/kernel/fs/isofs/isofs.ko\n\nNo errors. It worked. Kernel .66 loaded module from kernel .67. Let's try again to mount the CD-ROM:\n# mount /dev/cdrom /mnt\nmount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only\n\nHey! It worked!\nYes, but this still won't be any real help, because the CD being installed is VirtualBox Additions, which requires the running kernel headers to be installed. If the running kernel modules are no longer there, chances are that neither will the kernel headers. So the CD-ROM may be mounted, but the installer will fail upon launch.\nAlso, even if it somehow found the headers and the compilation did not fail, the newly compiled Virtualbox modules won't have anywhere to go, since the .66 modules directory has been cleaned (that's the reason the isofs module was not found in the first place!).\nBut say you fix all that, by restoring the modules and headers directories for the previous kernel: you've now essentially done an expensive (and partial) kernel downgrade, and the additions will be lost at the next reboot, together with the rest of .66 kernel, when the newly installed .67 kernel comes alive. Because the Virtualbox Additions CD launched from .66 kernel with the .66 headers dutifully installed the .66 kernel modules, not the .67's.\nDowngrading the kernel will work... for a while\nIf we remove the .67 kernel and reinstall the .66 kernel with modules in its stead, things will be hunky dory for a while. No reboot necessary, as in the \"force ISO module\" solution above.\nAnd a reboot will not lose anything, since no Additions-challenged kernel is installed.\nBut this way the kernel will still be in the \"to be upgraded\" list, and this same problem is bound to arise sooner or later (usually the day after, or the next week, depending on the frequency of the automatic updates).\nGranted, you can now have it arise in some more appropriate moment of your choice, which might be worth quite a lot. A forced upgrade in the middle of a coding marathon for a project which is running late is the devil.\nSo: just reboot! (and re-run the Additions CD).\nRebooting, the already installed and more recent .67 kernel will be activated and all its modules and headers are there; among these, the isofs module for reading ISO9660 CD filesystems.\n sudo reboot\n\nAfter the reboot, the CD-ROM will work and the Guest Additions will be installable.\nThe \"best\" sequence to update the kernel on VirtualBox with Additions is:\n apt-get update\n apt-get upgrade              (or apt-get dist-upgrade)\n reboot                       \n (re)install VirtualBox Additions on the new kernel that is now running\n apt-get autoremove\n\n(The next-to-latest old kernel might not be auto-removed for security reasons, to allow you to \"go back\").\n\nA: As per others answer this can be usually fixed by rebooting.\nSomehow \"iso9660\" module not loaded. depmod scans all modules and create module dependencies.\nsudo depmod -a\nsudo mount /dev/sr0 /mnt\nls -l /mnt\n\nthis will fix the issue. \n\nA: Try manually mounting it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal.\n\n*Type the following commands:\nsudo mount /dev/sr0 /mnt\nls -l /mnt\n\n\n*Then if the CD contents was shown, open /mnt in Nautilus (a.k.a File Manager) and intall the Guest Additions.\nIf those steps didn't work, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the guest additions ISO from the VM (via virtualbox website).\n\n*Right click on it --> Open with... --> Disk image mounter.\n\n*Open the newly mounted disk.\n\n", "Q: cannot use sudo after using sudo passwd root My System problem detected when I tried sudo passwd root in my ubuntu.\nI changed my root password by  using the below command.\nsudo passwd root\n\nNow my system password changed, after this i could not use sudo now.when I try to use sudo -i I am getting error messages below.\nsudo: error in /etc/sudo.conf, line 0 while loading plugin 'sudoers_policy'\nsudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be only be writable by owner\nsudo: fatal error, unable to load plugins\n\n\nA: Try:\nsu\npasswd -l root\nexit\n\nOnce made this, try again sudo -i\n", "Q: Difference between Ubuntu and Scientific Linux?

Recently, though, I wanted to back up a system completely. The harddrive had 300GB of storage. I mounted the main partition on the drive (NTFS) and copied all the files to an external drive (NTFS). As I waited for it to calculate how much it would be copying, the size it was reporting continued increasing, even beyond 300GB. (I never let it finish - I just backed up what was necessary.)\nI'm now backing up yet another harddrive (NTFS again) - a 500GB one to another external drive (NTFS). I was not able to mount the drive; so, this time I'm generating an image of it via the terminal \"cat\" command. I now found that the file it's generating has already exceeded 650GB and is still going. (Edit: it's now just past 850GB)\nWhat am I missing here? How can a drive have more information on it than it's physical size can hold? Or perhaps, what am I copying recursively? It might make some sense for the mounted HDD, but how could it possibly be more for the one I haven't even mounted? Or am I using the \"cat\" command wrong? sudo cat /dev/sdc > \"/media/ExternalDriveName/hdd-backup.img\"\n\nA: Well, I did some research to find out that my conception was wrong; and I do have an answer.\nThe Linux/Ubuntu /dev/ folder contains a list of device IO interfaces, not so much files. Here's a link to where I discovered this.\nSo, instead of reading a file, and dumping it to a file, I was reading an output stream, and dumping it to a file. Of course, output streams don't necessarily have any beginning or end, and can be read indefinitely. Thus, I have no idea what's in my backup file, other than what the HDD output while I was querying it.\n\nA: What is the type of the file system you are backing files to? I guess since you are backing up on a ubuntu it is ext4.\nDifferent filesystems may have differing overhead while allocating space for files.\nIn data storage, the smallest amount of disk space that can be allocated to\nhold a file is called a cluster. Most files are not the same size as the\ncluster size on a hard disk. The difference between the actual file size\nand the cluster size is called file slack. File slack is wasted space.\nThere will always be wasted space no matter what size the clusters are.\nFile size plus file slack equals Size on disk.\nIf your hard drive has 4KB cluster size and you have a file that is 1KB,\nFile Properties will show:\nSize: 1.00KB (1,024 bytes)\nSize on Disk: 4.00KB (4,096 bytes)\nYou can read more about Clusters on wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cluster\nSo the short answer is that on different file system you will have different file sizes.\nThe comparasion of different file systems:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems\nEDIT: you can also read this answer:\nWhy Same File Shows Different Sizes in Different Operating Systems\n", "Q: How do I resize a window when the edge is hidden by overlay scrollbars?

In other words, you are appending 100 GB to /dev/loop0 from the home directory in which Ubuntu is installed (given by /path/to/file).

It can be used for managing apps and scripts that run on a fresh system reboot or login.  So just do a search for it, open it and add the file you just created.\n\nA: Execute those commands:\nxinput set-button-map 9 1 0 3\nxinput set-button-map 10 1 0 3\n\nExplanation (kindly donated by @Yehosef):\nThe first number is the identifier of the pointer (you'll often only have one, in this case there were two, 9 and 10). \nThe next numbers are what you do with the first, second, and third  (ie, left, middle, right) mouse buttons. 1 0 3 tells it that the left button should do a left click (action 1), the middle button should do nothing, and the right button should do a right click (action 3).  If you want to make the middle button also do a left click you could use 1 1 3. If you wanted to switch the right and left actions you could use 3 0 1.  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Input for more info.\n\nA: Following instructions are based on info at Ubuntu Wiki\n(Scroll down to title \"Example: Disabling middle-mouse button paste on a scrollwheel mouse\").\nFirst, determine id of the pointer by listing input devices:\nxinput list | grep 'id='\n\nAnd look for the line that contains name of your pointer, there also should be id of the device, right after \"id=\". For example, id of this device is 10:\nLenovo ThinkPad Compact USB Keyboard with TrackPoint    id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nNext, get current button map of that device (I'll be using id of my device, which is 10):\nxinput get-button-map 10\n\nOutput:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nThis is mapping of pointer buttons to actions, where number represents action code, and position - button.\nWe're interested in second map - number 2 corresponds to action \"Middle Button Click\" and the position of it - to actual middle button.\nTo disable middle button triggering any action, I'd use command xinput set-button-map with id of the device and updated map (new action code is 0 - no action). No need to put whole map - map till interested button suffice (the rest just won't be updated):\n xinput set-button-map 10 1 0\n\nThat's it.\n\nA: set-button-map disables middle click functionality.

So I installed Ubuntu on a separate partition.\nAnyways, when I booted up after installation, the PC booted directly up into Ubuntu, so I downloaded the Boot-Repair tool and ran it. When I boot up now, I reach the GRUB menu with Ubuntu as the only entries. Boot-Repair gave me this log.\nHow do I correctly add my Windows 8.1 to GRUB? I have just a little experience with Ubuntu (and Linux systems in general), so I am not sure what to do.\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: So it depends on what order you installed everything, you might be able to repair, you might have to start over. I'll share some of my thoughts and if you can provide more details on how you set things up we can narrow down a solution for you.\nThe generally recommended sequence of installation is to prepare your partitions, install windows, then install linux so when grub2 configures it will find the windows bootloader and add to the grub menu. On machine's that come with WIndows preinstalled, you can shrink your windows partition using the Windows Disk Management utility from the Adminiistrative Tools section in the Control Panel, or you can just fire up a live linux disk/usb stick and use GParted as well. \nIf you install Windows second it likes to be the only OS on your system so will automatically bulldoze whatever grub files you had in the MBR. So in your case I hope you upgraded to windows 8.1 first.  \nAs far as finding an existing windows bootloader and adding to your grub menu you could try using os-prober which will do exactly what it sounds, probe your system for installed OSes and adds them to your bootloader.\nIt's always encouraged to read up on the documentation for your relevant problem. The Arch Linux Wiki is fantastically thorough and kept well up-to-date, the Grub section is here and another good resource is Dedoimedo's Grub Tutorial.\nIf your computer is a bit older then you likely should be installing the grub2 bootloader into partition containing the Windows MBR which is usually /dev/sda.\nIf your computer is bit newer and has an efi boot partition then you can install one of the more recent Ubuntu builds like 14.04 and install your grub2 bootloader into the efi partition. This may vary by device depending on how your manufacturer set up the partition scheme. You should be able to see which partition is labeler \"efi\" using something like the GParted partition manager.\nNewer Ubuntu-based distros seem to work well on efi machines. I've had good luck with stock Ubuntu 12.04+, Linux Mint 16+ and Ubuntu-Gnome 12.04+.\nAnother thing you can check is your machine's boot order in the EFI/BIOS settings. My EFI settings show both ubuntu and windows and I can adjust the priority of which will boot first. If you can see the Windwos bootloader in your EFI/BIOS menu then you might just need to use the os-prober to add Windows to your grub, which would be the simplest solution. \nLet us know how you fare. \n", "Q: who is the root user in Ubuntu Who is the root user in Ubuntu  or on any Linux based distribution?

(I am very new to shell scripting.)\n\nA: This will make you clear (Check the Whitespaces):\n$ var=c\n\n$ [\"$var\" == \"c\"] && echo \"OK\"\n[c: command not found\n\n$ [\"$var\" == \"c\" ] && echo \"OK\"\n[c: command not found\n\n$ [ \"$var\" == \"c\"] && echo \"OK\"\nbash: [: missing `]'\n\n$ [ \"$var\" == \"c\" ] && echo \"OK\"\nOK\n\nSo, you need to put whitespace prior to and after the condition while using test ([ ])command. \n\nA: there is one simple error on line 6 and 9. There should be space between [ and $response in if [$response = \"y\"]then on line 6; . Similarly, for [ and $response on line 9`\nAlso you must put double qoutes around $response to avoid errors in case user enters a input with space.\n\nA: Also, the set command is more exotic than you think. \nYou don’t use the set command to set variables.\nYou know that, when you invoke a shell script with parameters,\nthat they get assigned to $1, $2, $3, …; right?  Well,\none of the things the set command does is to set $1, $2, $3, …\nfor the current (interactive) shell.  So, for example,\n% set checkpoint=\"y\"\n% echo \"$checkpoint\"\n                                (nothing)\n% echo \"arg1 = '$1', arg2 = '$2', arg3 = '$3'\"\narg1 = 'checkpoint=y', arg2 = '', arg3 = ''\n% set checkpoint = \"y\"\n% echo \"$checkpoint\"\n                                (nothing)\n% echo \"arg1 = '$1', arg2 = '$2', arg3 = '$3'\"\narg1 = 'checkpoint', arg2 = '=', arg3 = 'y'\nwhich is not what you want.\nAnd you have another problem.  The correct syntax is\ncheckpoint=\"t\"\n\nIf you say\n$checkpoint=\"t\"\n\nand $checkpoint is not set, this command reduces to\n=\"t\"\n\nwhich looks for a program called =t (which probably doesn’t exist).  Similarly,\n$checkpoint = \"t\"\n\nreduces to\n= \"t\"\n\nwhich looks for a program called =. \nEven worse, if $checkpoint is already set to \"t\", and you say\n$checkpoint=\"f\"\n\nthen that is interpreted as\nt=\"f\"\n\nthus setting the variable t (i.e., $t).\n\nA: Bash interprets your $response  as commands it can't find.

I'm still a newbie to Linux/networking\nIve been trying to figure out this problem for over a week and none of the related questions others have asked have helped me. I recently built a webserver running on apache2 to host my own website. I also intended to use it for SSH, FTP, and VNC. I registered a domain at GoDaddy, cokongwu.com. A static ip (192.168.0.105) has been setup for the server and I have setup portforwarding as well for port 80, 21, 23, 53 and 443 to the static ip. reading the guides on how to setup a publicly accessible webserver, I thought this was all that was needed, as it was working perfectly at first, but of course I found out that once I  tried to access the webserver using the domain name outside the network, I couldnt connect. After some more searching I found out that I needed to change my A record in my zone file at GoDaddy to my public ip. Once I did that I found that I was no longer able to connect to my webserver at all, either inside the network, where I would instead be redirecred to the router page, as well as outside the network where the connection would simply time out. I later figured out that since my public ip couldnt be set to static I had to use a service, specifically dyndns so that it would be able to constantly update the ip when it changes. I setup the dyndns updater from the software update center and setup my dyndns account, cokongwu.com, with an A record that points to my public ip and an alias www.cokongwu.com that points to cokongwu.com. I also setup a hostname, cokongwu.dyndns.org which also points to my public ip and added the dyndns nameservers to Godaddy's nameservers. The A record I have for cokongwu.com at godaddy still points to my internal ip and the CName records (www and cokongwu.com) both point to cokongwu.dyndns.org.(however, since I replaced godaddys nameserves with dyndns nameservers, I can no longer manage the zone file for the domain) \nAfter all this, trying to access hostname.com still provides the same problems as before. Accessing it points to my public ip instead of my internal ip, but within the network I just get forwarded to my routers setting page and outside the network it just times out. I'm out of ideas as to how to fix this, so any ideas are welcome. Shouldnt it(the public ip) be redirected to my internal ip?\nOnce again sorry if I'm using any of these technical words in the wrong way, I'm still very new to this whole thing.\nI know a lot of questions related to this post certain commands so I'll do the same:  \nActive Internet connections (only servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5556          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      3387/dyn_updater\ntcp        0      0 127.0.1.1:53            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -               \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -               \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:631           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -               \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3306            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -               \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5900            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2729/vino-server\ntcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      -               \ntcp6       0      0 :::21                   :::*                    LISTEN      -               \ntcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      -               \ntcp6       0      0 ::1:631                 :::*                    LISTEN      -               \ntcp6       0      0 :::5800                 :::*                    LISTEN      2729/vino-server\ntcp6       0      0 :::5900                 :::*                    LISTEN      2729/vino-server\nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5353            0.0.0.0:*                           -               \nudp        0      0 127.0.1.1:53            0.0.0.0:*                           -               \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:39124           0.0.0.0:*                           -               \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:631             0.0.0.0:*                           -               \nudp6       0      0 :::5353                 :::*                                -               \nudp6       0      0 :::53973                :::*                                -       \n\nufw:\nsudo ufw status\n[sudo] password for fender: \nStatus: inactive\n\n000-default.conf:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that\n    # the server uses to identify itself.

Since that router wont route traffic coming to the external IP number from the inside back to the inside, traffic will stop at that point.\nFor things to work inside the network, www.cokongwu.com wil have to be resolved as your internal IP number (192.168.0.105). You can try to browse the web server using the internal IP number, but since you plan to use SSL, eventually that will require you to  access the web server using the FQDN or you will get certificate errors.\nThe \"hard way\" to fix internal name resolution is to setup an internal DNS server, but the above will work trouble shooting and small scale deployments. You seem no stranger to google and if you want to set up an internal DNS server, there are many guides to that on the internet.\nOnce internal name resolution gives you the internal IP address, browsing to the web server will give the same reply as if you we're a client coming from the outside.\n2 - external access to the web server.\nResolving www.cokongwu.com with dig www.cokongwu.com +noall +answer gave me the following reply.\nwww.cokongwu.com.   0   IN  CNAME   cokongwu.com.\ncokongwu.com.       59  IN  A   69.171.137.28\nThis shows that the www host is a cname (alias) pointing towards cokongwu.com which is a A-record.

If the dyndns update is working, that should be your current public IP address. Verify this with the following command at a command line:\ncurl -s checkip.dyndns.org | sed -e 's/.*Current IP Address: //' -e 's/<.*$//'\n\n(shamelesly stolen from here) Or by browsing to www.whatismyip.com\nAssuming this is your current, browsing to www.cokongwu.com should work from the outside ...\nI tried that and it didn't work, which could mean any or a combination of the following:\nA - The dyndns service hasn't updated your IP address\nB - The forwarding in your outside router isn't working\nC - The web server isn't replying\nDoing a quick test using telnet <ip number> <port number> gives no replies from any of the port numbers you listed above. This would lead me to believe that the reason should be A or B. If it is B, it could be that you either didnt port forward correctly or if you're using a router in conjunction with your modem, you haven't properly bridged the modem to the router to allow it to handle all portforwarding requests.\nSome further thoughts\nI notice that you mentioned port 53 as one of the ports forwarded to the web server. Port 53 UDP is the standard for incoming dns requests. Unless you actually have a dns server running on the web server machine, you can safely close this port ... it wont serve any purpose anyway.\nI also noticed you mention using ssh and ftp, but opened port 21 and 23 in the firewall and forwarded to the web server.\nPort 23 is the telnet port and port 21 is the FTP port.\nI would strongly advise using neither of these services, since they're both unsafe protocols that will transmit everything in clear text, including usernames and passwords.\nI recommend only opening and forwarding port 22 in the firewall. Port 22 is used by ssh, which is the encryopted replacement to telnet. Port 22 is also used by the scp service, which use the ssh service for file transfer. Using ssh and scp instead of telnet and ftp will keep all your traffic to and from the web server secure.\nA further recommendation would be to use a different port for incoming ssh, preferably a port number over 1000, like port 1522 (just an example). This is to avoid the incoming ssh service to be discovered by external port scans. Simply change the incoming port from 22 to a higher port number (i.e. 1522), but still keep it forwarded to port 22 on the web server. Then access the ssh server from the outside using the high port number (1522) and from the inside using port 22.\nI hope this is of any use to you and hope you solve your problem =)\n", "Q: Prevent Skype resolvers getting your IP on Ubuntu I am running Skype version 4.3.0.37 on Ubuntu 14.10, and I know that on the Windows version there is an option to only allow direct connections to your machine through Skype for Skype contacts, which thus means that Skype resolvers cannot resolve your IP. \nBut on the Skype version for Ubuntu there is no such option, so I was wondering if this could be somehow still achieved?\n\nA: Type the following command:\ngedit ~/.Skype/YourSkypeName/config.xml \n\nSearch for <Account> and add in that section:\n<PrivateSkypeMode>1</PrivateSkypeMode>\n\n", "Q: How to Setup GPT for 3TB I have a 3TB HDD that I want to run Ubuntu 14.10 server as a file server. How can I format the drive so it will work?\n\nA: If you install Ubuntu in EFI/UEFI mode, it will use GPT by default. It will probably also use GPT when you install to an over-2TiB disk, although I've recently discovered some cases when it won't do that. (This was when using MAAS to do a fast-path install in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, though, which is relatively exotic.)\nIf you want to be 100% sure of what you're getting, create your partitions ahead of time. If you use gdisk, you'll be pretty much guaranteed of getting GPT, unless you jump through gdisk's hoops to translate to MBR. If you use GParted or parted, be sure to create a partition table of type GPT.\nIf you boot in BIOS mode, I recommend you create a BIOS Boot Partition and a separate Linux /boot partition early on the disk (under the 2TiB mark; but as the first two partitions is likely to be simplest). The reason is that there's a bug that prevents some systems from booting when critical boot files are above the 2TiB mark. This seems to be primarily a BIOS bug, but the workaround is to be sure that the BIOS isn't asked to access anything beyond 2^32 sectors itself, which can be done by putting /boot and the BIOS Boot Partition below that point. Note that this is a BIOS bug; it doesn't affect any EFI when booted in EFI mode, AFAIK.\n\nA: *\n\n*find out some information about your new disk.\n\n\ntype:\nlsblk\n\nnote down the /dev/sdXX\n\n\n*now creating a GPT and new partition.\n\n\ntype:\nfdisk /dev/sdXX\n\nreplace /dev/sdXX with your disk. example: /dev/sdc\ntype the following:\nd\nenter\nw\nenter\n\nthis makes sure you deleted any existing partitions... but if its a new HDD then there probably werent any. it then writes the changes. you can press (p) to print any partions that might be there. if you see some listed then just delete them.\npress UP a few a couple times and you should see your fdisk command or just retype it.\nnow that your back in fdisk type:\ng\nenter\nw\nenter\n\nsame as above retype your fdisk command to get back in or press up a couple times to find the command.\nnow that your back in fdisk type:\nm\n\nthis will give you list of other things to do. the (n) command creates a new partition. by default it will be set to \"linux\". you can change this by using the (t) command after the partition is created.\nafter you (w)rite your changes to save them then you probably want to format the disk. depending on what you want the command will change. it will be something like this though..\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/sdxx\nmkfs.ntfs /dev/sdxx\n\nwhere \"sdxx\" is going to be the partition not the entire disk. so it will be something like sdc1, sdc2, sdc6, etc.\n", "Q: Problem in unmounting a disk image with a script... but not manually! It is my first experience in writing shell scripts and something curious is happening. I'm working on an embedded system and I wanted my script test5.sh placed in the /root folder of the guest system to mount the first partition of an eMMC card image, perform a test on it, remove the files created by test1, kill the process still accessing the card [to avoid resource busy, in my case there's always just one single process from fuser command] and finally I want to unmount the card itself. This is what I wrote:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncd ../dev\ne2fsck mmcblk0p1\nmount -t auto mmcblk0p1 ../mnt\ncd ../mnt\n./../bin/test1\nrm file*\nvariable=$(fuser -m /mnt)\necho $variable\nkill -9 $variable\necho \"Before the problem\"\numount /mnt\necho \"After the problem\"\n\nThe problem is that the last umount command is not executed as I can check from the terminal output:\n# ./test5.sh \ne2fsck 1.42.12 (29-Aug-2014)\nmmcblk0p1: clean, 11/117360 files, 7386/468990 blocks\nSTARTED\nrandom: nonblocking pool is initialized\nENDED\n647\nKilled\n# mount\n[...]\nmmcblk0p1 on /mnt type ext2 (rw,relatime,errors=continue)\n\nAt this point if I manually send the last command in the script:\numount /mnt\n\nthe operation is successfully accomplished [I checked with mount]. Why is the last line of the script \"invisible\"? I can't find the missing point. How to fix this issue?\nThanks in advance to those who will try to help\n\nedit\n\nI'm beginning to think that the umount /command is not executed because of the process I kill; when manually running:\nlsof /mnt\n\nto have a verbose output instead of fuser -m /mnt [which returns just 640] the output is:\n# lsof /mnt\n1   /bin/busybox    /dev/console\n1   /bin/busybox    /dev/console\n1   /bin/busybox    /dev/console\n624 /bin/busybox    /dev/null\n624 /bin/busybox    /dev/null\n624 /bin/busybox    /dev/null\n624 /bin/busybox    socket:[747]\n624 /bin/busybox    /tmp/messages\n625 /bin/busybox    /dev/null\n625 /bin/busybox    /dev/null\n625 /bin/busybox    /dev/null\n625 /bin/busybox    socket:[751]\n640 /bin/busybox    /dev/ttyAMA0\n640 /bin/busybox    /dev/ttyAMA0\n640 /bin/busybox    /dev/ttyAMA0\n640 /bin/busybox    /dev/tty\n\nWhat it seems to me is that killing the process with pid 640 [the one who gives the resource busy, ttyAMA0 is the serial port of my embedded system] means the death of the rest of the script [even the two final echo lines are skipped]. And when manually executing the kill line I have to login again while when launching the script this doesn't happen. Now it would be nice to know the reason and the fix\n\nA: Your script does not unmount the device during script because of the fact that your script contains\n cd ../mnt which means the current working directory is the same where your device has been mounted thus change your script as :\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncd ../dev\ne2fsck mmcblk0p1\nmount -t auto mmcblk0p1 ../mnt\ncd ../mnt\n./../bin/test1\nrm file*\nvariable=$(fuser -m /mnt)\necho $variable\nkill -9 $variable\ncd ~\nsudo umount -f /mnt\n\n", "Q: OS X and Ubuntu on a USB-stick what do you end op with if you follow How to create a bootable USB stick on OS X? will it delete OS X or can i use my Mac (OS X) normally when the usb-stick is not connected?\n\nA: You can use OS X even when the usb-stick is connected.

After some trial and error, installation went fine with no errors. But when time came to run the server.js file, I get this error: { [Error: Cannot find module 'connect/lib/utils'] code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND' } \nSo that's the lot of my problem... any ideas?\n\nA: Ran into the same issue. Here's how I fixed it:\nFor whatever reason, the default install script seemed to fail to add a number of the modules.  I iteratively added the modules as errors referred to their absence by running npm install nameofmodule (in your case 'connect') then attempting to start c9 again.\nEventually this resulted in the c9 IDE starting but more references to missing modules being generated. I repeated the above, Ctrl + C killing the ide, installing the module and relaunching until I got to what appears to be a fully functional state.\nWeb browsing to the IDE and taking action results in output to the console you launched the IDE from so keep an eye on that for any more missing modules once you are up and running.\n", "Q: Wireless card disconecting From what I can see there is an awful lot about this online already.

For example, if I install a software on a machine, it should be somehow easier to install the same software on the other machine. Or if I change my sshd settings, then similar. I am okay if this causes the two computers to end up identical, although I'd prefer the ability to have some machine specific settings too. \n\nA: Have you heard of Macrium Reflect ?

Most often it happens in Chrome yet I've experienced this in PyCharm IDE as well and maybe some other applications.\nI should probably note, that keyboard stops working only in the application in which this problem triggered - if that happened in Chrome for example, I can't type there and all is fine with other apps.\nI'm not perfectly sure that the source switching triggers it, yet it appears so.\nWhat would you recommend me to do? \nIf there's no obvious solution, how should I 'debug' it?\nMy OS is Ubuntu 14.10 (with Unity).\nThank you.\nUPDATE: I must also note that things were the same with alt + shift combination.\nUPDATE 2: I followed advice by @ElderGeek and changed the source switching key to f2, for some time things were working well for me, but now the trouble is back. I need to relaunch an application in order to get keyboard working in it.\nUPDATE 3: I confirm that keyboard turning off is not related to the source switching.\nUPDATE 4: The problem persists after clean installation. \n\nA: I've had this problem with Pycharm when I first installed Unity and did some customs, am still not sure if the problem occurred from Unity \nHere is what you want to do: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install  DConf Editor & Lunch it.\n\n*Go to Desktop Then ibus\n\n*General\n\n*Now check the box next to use-global-engine and\nuse-system-keyboard-layout\n\n\n\nEdit: Make sure to match the keyboard input method:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Settings > Language Support\n\n*At the bottom part find \"Keyboard input method system\"\n\n*Choose iBus, Or you can try all of them. (Required reboot)\n\n*After making the change, you need to restart for the settings to\ntake effect.\n\n\n\n\nA: There are a number of chrome specific keyboard shortcuts many of which use some combintaion of CTRL Shift. This could easily create some incompatibilites with your \"source switching\" key combination. \nRecommendation: Change your source switching key combo if possible to something not reserved for your commonly used applications.\nSource: http://www.shortcutworld.com/en/linux/Chrome.html\n\nA: It could very well be caused by a corrupted dconf database. \nYou can find out by removing or (temporarily?) renaming the directory ~/.config/dconf/, and log out and back in to force the creation of a new database.\nIf it turns out to be the cause, you can remove the outdated database.\nEdit\nYou mentioned in a comment that it has occurred on several installations already, and also after a clean install. That makes it almost certainly a hardware issue. That would also explain the unpredictable occurrence of the symptoms.\n", "Q: Running ubuntu from ext4 formatted USB drive? The \"Make Startup Disk\" ubuntu utility sees it as writable only if it's fat formatted.\nIf I format it to Ext4, it sees it as 0 free space and doesn't allow to click \"Make startup disk\" button.\nHowever, since I plan to use the drive to run the OS (not just install) and will store files bigger than 4gb i would like to have bootable usb drive on ext4\nWould that be possible? \n\nA: Yes. You can do what you intend. \nThe correct approach to your desired result is to simply \"Install Ubuntu\" to the external drive rather than use \"Make Startup Disk\" utility. That utility is designed to create a small boot disk as  a method for troubleshooting and repair or installation, not for running the OS as you intend. \nIf you want the \"Try Ubuntu\" Option on the drive as well, you can simply dd the ISO image to the drive as outlined here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#Install_and_run_Startup_Disk_Creator_alias_usb-creator\n\nA: I think you're dealing with a permission problem.\nUse: \nsudo chmod -R a+rwX,o-w /media/[your_drive_name]\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/[your_drive_name]\nThen eject the drive and insert again.

Also try fiddling with the antenna alignment, try a 90 degree rotation of the ap to see if there is any difference in signal strength. Note the strength is listed in negative dBm, so a small negative is better -- look at the quality too, higher is better there.  \n\nThey do sell higher gain antennas for wireless routers too.  Since you don't have any neighbors to interfere with,  that is a good possibility.\n", "Q: Desktop 14.04 stuck during installation Screenshot:\n\nBoth from USB and CD, it gets stuck at this screen. It briefly responds to keyboard input before not responding at all.\nI've run it selecting acpi=off and nomodeset with the same results.\nI'm using a HP Compaq Elite 8100.\n\nA: The relevant error here is:\n\"A TPM error (7) occurred attempting to read a pcr value\"\n\nThere seems to be an incompatibility with a TPM (trusted platform module) security chip your machine has. Try to look through the BIOS for an option to disable it. If you google around for this error, you will also find people working around this problem by enabling the chip when it was disabled before.\nIf that doesn't help, have a look at this related question. It seems the boot just hangs for a couple of minutes. So you could still boot and install and fix the problem as described in the linked question.\n\nA: An alternative solution was to install 12.04 using acpi=off and nomodeset, then updating to 14.04 via Software Updater.\n", "Q: Force Firefox to use xdg-open to open downloaded files Firefox in Kubuntu is broken, as it doesn't follow the system default applications that I can configure using \"file associations\" in the KDE Control Module. For example, it wants to open folders with K4dirstat, videos in itself and PDF files with GIMP.\nI want Firefox to download everything (or almost everything) by default, and then when I double click the downloaded file in Firefox I want it do open using xdg-open (or using the application xdg-open would use), including \"open the containing folder\" thing.\nMy question is similar to this question from 2011: Firefox: open downloaded files with system default application\nBut I want \"save file\" marked in that window, and later open with a sane application from within Firefox.\nThis unanswered question also seems related, as if it is possible to do what I want. I think that other question is answered too: https://askubuntu.com/questions/546113/change-default-application-for-a-file-type-in-dolphin-and-firefox\n\nA: I am not sure this is exactly what is asked. I will be posting on\nhow to make Firefox downloads list open a file in a desired application.\nSome newly installed applications take over the \"default\" status in Firefox's about:preferences instead of the per-filetype normal application set at system level (e.g. Palemoon takes over as default instead of gwenview for JPEG files, Inkscape or File Roller takes over instead of Okular for a PDF file.).\n\"Always ask\" is the choice that should be used in this case and then trying to create a per-user file ~/.local/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache with the lines:\n[MIME Cache]\napplication/pdf=okularApplication_pdf.desktop\n\nThe disadvantage of the above is that it is a per-file-type setting. To have a solution for all files (as said in this answer), run:\ncd .local/share/applications/\nln -s mimeapps.list defaults.list\n\nIn case this stops working: see that the undesired application is not again selected under about:preferences: be sure \"Always ask\" is selected there. Setting manually a different program (even the default for your file-type at system level, but which is not marked as \"default\" in the list for your file under about:preferences) might not work.\n\nTested in Firefox 60.0 in Kubuntu 18.04.\n", "Q: Will a Ubuntu install disk made on Windows run on a Mac?

I don't want to remove my Nvidia, because I remember when I just installed Ubuntu, I had overheating problem. Just after installing Nvidia 304, the problem was solved. \nSo, can someone suggest me something. If I want to stay with the plan to install Wine, what should I do?

And both of them are working.\nBasically, you need to use aptitude to exam each conflict carefully and modify the right entries in /var/lib/dpkg/status so that the dependencies for installed packages get changed and they no longer cause conflict with new packages.

I am using GTK.3.15. When attempting to open GTK Inspector using the Ctrl+Shift+I or  Ctrl+Shift+D,\nnothing happens. Does not matter what application or widget I am using. Nothing happens\nand my understanding is that this option comes standard on GTK 3.15. Does anyone know how\nto use this tool in GTK 3.15?\n\nA: I got this from https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK%2B/Inspector:\n\nGtkInspector is the built-in interactive debugging support in GTK+. It was added in GTK+ 3.14, based on a copy of the well-estabished gtkparasite.\nThe debugger is disabled by default. To enable it run in a terminal:   \n\ngsettings set org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding true\n\n\nAnd launch it pressing on the keyboard Control-Shift-I or Control-Shift-D.\nIf you don't want to use the shortcuts, you can also run it temporarily directly when running your app with:  \n\nGTK_DEBUG=interactive your-app\n\nLooking further, I found Bug #1523929 which indicates that users can install libgtk-3-dev which then provides the schema. Note that installing libgtk-3-dev may bring in a lot of dependencies.\n\nA: Updated: 2023-01\nThe wiki page for the Inspector seems to be a bit out of date, and at times bugs interfere with documented functionality. What's more, a lot of this functionality is implemented inconsistently in applications, which has clearly led to a lot of people being steered in a lot of wrong directions. (Including by previous versions of this answer.)\n\nIf you don't want to use the shortcuts, you can also open the Inspector directly when running your app with:\n\nThe handling of GTK_DEBUG does appear to have been fixed, so that GTK_DEBUG=interactive in the environment will auto-open the inspector. That wasn't working for me in the past, but in Fedora 37 it works as described.\n\nTo launch the GTK Inspector, focus your GTK application and press Control-Shift-D. Alternatively, move your mouse cursor to your desired widget and press Control-Shift-I to specifically inspect the widget under the mouse cursor.\n\nSo, turns out these statements are correct-ish, but they should be accompanied by a whole bunch of caveats.\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+D might work, if the application hasn't bound it to something else.\n\n\n*Similarly, Ctrl+Shift+I might work, under the same conditions.\nAnd while it is, technically, a context-sensitive shortcut that will inspect \"the widget under the mouse cursor\", many applications draw their entire interface inside a big GtkDrawingArea so don't be surprised if that's the widget that pops up for most mouse locations. (You won't be able to inspect anything inside that area, anyway, as the contents are not Gtk widgets.)\n\n\n*If an application has bound away one or both of the shortcuts, its local bindings will override and there's nothing you can do about that.\n\n*\n\n*Nautilus, in particular, has a different binding for Ctrl+Shift+I (it's \"Invert selection\"), so that shortcut will never work to open the inspector in Nautilus, and you have to use only Ctrl+Shift+D.\n\n\n*Gnome Terminal actually binds both Ctrl+Shift+D and Ctrl+Shift+I, so neither shortcut will work... which is why they provide a handy Help > Inspector option in the application menubar (if you activate that).\n\n\n\n\n*Last but not least, there's a bug in Gtk's handling of Ctrl+Shift+D that might prevent it from working every other time you try to use it. (Ctrl+Shift+I doesn't seem to be affected.)\nTo get to the inspector, you'll need to satisfy the items on this list:\n\n*\n\n*Install the appropriate gtk3-devel / libgtk-3-dev or gtk4-devel / libgtk-4-dev package. Non-optional.\n\n\n*If using Gtk3, enable the dconf key /org/gtk/settings/debug/enable-inspector-keybinding / GSettings key org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding. (They're the same setting.) Optionally, you can disable org.gtk.Settings.Debug inspector-warning.\nGtk4 has its own enable-inspector-keybinding key at org.gtk.gtk4.settings.debug, but it now defaults True so you're probably already good there. org.gtk.gtk4.settings.debug.inspector-warning still also defaults to True, though, so you may want to turn that off.\n\n\n*Either:\n\n*\n\n*Run a program with GTK_DEBUG=interactive in the environment.\n\n*When the application is open and focused, type Ctrl+Shift+D or Ctrl+Shift+I and hope one of them works. Or look for a menu option to do the same thing.\n\n\n\n\nA: Method 1:\n\nEnable the shortcut:\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf-editor with sudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\n*Navigate to org > gtk > settings > debug\n\n*Set enable-inspector-keybinding to true\n\n*Try the shortcut.\n\nMethod 2:\n\nRun the program to debug with the GTK_DEBUG variable:\nInstead of running the program to debug as usual (myprogram --argument) you only need to run it of this way (GTK_DEBUG=interactive myprogram --argument)\nAlso you can export that variable with export GTK_DEBUG=interactive and then run the program.\n", "Q: Find directories and create new sub directory inside each directory found I need to insert a file in a new subdirectory that I will create when the find command is executed.\n# find /home/user*/.dir/anotherdir -maxdepth 1 -type d -iname \"*.default\" \nanotherdir/dwwcop9o.default\nanotherdir/dge77smm.default\n\nIn each of the above \"find\" results I need to create subdir so that the directory structure would look like below:\nanotherdir/dwwcop9o.default/subdir\nanotherdir/dge77smm.default/subdir\n\nFinally, after creating subdir above, I need to insert a file inside of the subdir.\nHow do I do this using xargs, -exec or -execdir?\n\nA: Finally able to solve this, see below.\n# find /home/user*/.dir/anotherdir -maxdepth 1 -type d -iname \"*.default\" -exec mkdir {}/anotherdir \\; -exec cp newfile {}/anotherdir \\;\n\nN.B.\nnewfile must be in your current working directory, if not, define its absolute path.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS Mouse clicks This seems to be a common issue in older versions but nothing I could find would solve issues in this version.

I would like to have a folder mounted as temporary, which is actually my RAM. This is so that, for example, I could copy a movie into my RAM, unplug my external drive, and then watch it.

The size can be whatever you like as long as it fits into your available memory.\nmount -t tmpfs -o size=1024m tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk\n\nIf you want this to be permanent do the following steps:\nOpen this file in nano or in whatever your preferred editor is.\nnano /etc/fstab\n\nAdd the following line to that file and save the file.\ntmpfs       /mnt/ramdisk tmpfs nodev,nosuid,noexec,nodiratime,size=1024M   0 0\n\nThis line is supposed to be one uninterrupted line.

Every time I decrease the brightness of my screen, it will be back to 100% next time I reboot. How can I save the adjustment and apply it once for all? Thanks.\n\nA: Assuming you are using the Intel 4500MHD - you need to set a value in /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness to whatever is comfortable. A value is simply written here. First, find out what the max value is by running\ncat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness\n\nIn my case it is 5273. After you reduce the brightness to something comfortable, check the value in /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness by running \ncat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nIn my case it was 2040. To set this value at boot time just type\nsudo echo \"echo \"2040 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\" >> /etc/rc.local\" so that this value is set at boot up.\nThis is what I did on my Lenovo G510 using the Intel 4500 graphics.

As the name implies, this is done in the interests of shaving a second or two off the boot time. You may need to disable the \"fast boot\" option in the firmware in order to boot from a USB flash drive. Some systems enable you to partially disable this feature, which should enable booting from a USB flash drive. Others call the option something different -- it may be listed under a \"built-in devices\" menu or something similar. It may also be phrased positively rather than negatively -- that is, you might need to \"enable USB devices\" rather than \"disable fast boot.\" Thus, you'll have to dig through your computer's options to figure out what to enable or disable.\n", "Q: Brightness Get Maximum at Every Restart Brightness is not remembering it's last state.

I couldn't even get it to boot over to the \"repair\" option to try to restore factory defaults. I don't know what was wrong with it, but I had been curious about Ubuntu/Linux for some time and wanted to give it a shot.\nI've tried giving Ubuntu 14.10 a go of it since December 2014, but it's just gotten to the point where it is too limiting. I don't understand most of the instructions people give me (i.e. I have no clue what a 'chroot' is or any of the jargon) and I want to scrap it and go back to Windows.\nI was just checking things out and when I first boot up the computer, the GRUB screen lists a Windows Repair option now. I can get it to load, but it throws an error stating \"No file system recognized\". I assume this is because at this point I have my whole hard drive partitioned to Ubuntu.\nCompounding matters: I don't have a Windows 7 CD. I bought this machine from Best Buy a few years ago (read: out of warranty) but it had Windows 7 on it by default, hence the restore factory settings option I have in the GRUB screen.\nSo what I'm looking for at this point is a concise way to remove Ubuntu from my system and reformat the whole hard drive to a Windows-friendly format like NTFS or whatever Windows 7 likes. Then, I should be able to snag the repair option, restore factory defaults, and roll from there.\nSo please, can you explain the uninstall process in as basic a manner as possible? I just don't know my way around Ubuntu well. I know how to open a command prompt and I do have the Ubuntu install CD. I read something about using a \"bootrec /fixmbr\" option but when I do that, I get an error stating that the bootrec command was not found. That's if I run it from either a command prompt while in Ubuntu or from the GRUB screen by pushing \"c\" for a command prompt there. I don't know where else I'd type it in if not in either of those places.\n\nA: You may need to buy a Windows CD to get Windows back since you said that the entire disk is devoted to Ubuntu. \nThe reason you cannot reformat the hard drive is that you are using the operating system from the hard drive; the formatting program recognizes this and prevents you from removing the operating system from under itself. \nRun the program, Diskmanager, and check the number of partitions on the drive; if you only have 1, then you need to buy a Windows CD.\nIf you have 2 or more, then the restoration copy of the Windows installation may still be on the drive. To utilize this, you will need to create a bootable CD (or USB drive) with gparted. It's very easy to make a bootable CD (instructions are provided at the web site), and a little more difficult to make the bootable USB (some computers also won't boot from USB). gparted will allow you to reformat the Ubuntu partition as NTFS. \nThis is the part I don't know about. How to access the restoration partition to get the original copy of Windows. \n\nA: So I was able to download a Windows 7 ISO, then burn it to a DVD and use that to reinstall Windows. I wanted to let anyone who was checking know so that this had closure.

[Y/n] n\nAbort.\n\nWhy such huge dependency? Are they all really necessary? Any way to have the software with lighter installation?\n\nA: Texmaker is a particular case. Whomever packaged it, correctly assumed it will be used to create and compile LaTeX documents, and thus marked TexLive as a recommended dependency. TexLive is a bit of a monster, the complete package suite is over 1 Gb; Texmaker marks the most common modules, that should cover most users needs.\nYou can instruct apt to install Texmaker without the recommended packages:\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install texmaker\nNow you should have Texmaker installed, but are unable to compile LaTeX documents; for that you must install TexLive. Fortunately, the texlive package marks few dependencies: \nsudo apt-get install texlive\nThis gets you a minimal compiler, many common LaTeX modules and fonts will not be available.\nIf you need a LaTeX module that is not present in base packages, then the best alternative is to manually install TexLive from CTAN and use tlmgr to cherry pick the modules you need. \n\nA: You see it depends...\nWe can assume that when you install one of the first applications on your fresh Ubuntu installation where there are no dependencies, some dependencies will be required.\nBut as time goes by, there will be many cases when dependencies required by apt-get overlap and there will be no need for downloading them again.\ne.g. \n\n\n*\n\n*App A needs dependencies [ \"dep3\", \"dep6\", \"dep87\", \"dep45\" ] = 1000MB\n\n*App B needs dependencies [ \"dep3\", \"dep6\", \"dep87\" ] = 2MB, because some were already installed.\n\n", "Q: Command \"sudo apt-get update\" runs with some error I am new to Ubuntu.

You now have Windows installed in EFI mode and Linux installed in BIOS mode. Most computers make it difficult to switch from one boot mode to the other, so such mixed-mode installations are difficult to manage.\nTo fix it, install an EFI boot loader for Linux. As detailed on the page to which I've just linked, several are available; but as part of the normal process of EFI boot loader installation requires that you be booted in EFI mode, you can't do this from your current Ubuntu installation -- at least, not without jumping through some extra hoops. There are several ways around this, one of which is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R from the downloaded image.\n\n*Boot the rEFInd medium you've just prepared. This may require using your firmware's built-in boot manager or going into the setup utility and disabling BIOS/CSM/legacy support. If you use the boot manager and see two entries for your boot medium, select the one with \"UEFI\" in the description string.\n\n*In rEFInd, you should see an entry for Windows and one or more entries to boot Linux kernels. Select one of the latter and Ubuntu should start. Note, however, that if you used a separate /boot partition, you'll need to hit F2 or Insert twice, rather than Enter, to launch Ubuntu. When you do this, a simple line editor will open, in which you must enter a root= specification pointing your kernel to your root filesystem.\n\n*In Linux, install the boot loader of your choice. Two relatively easy ways to do this are:\n\n*\n\n*Install the rEFInd Debian package or PPA, as described on the rEFInd page. This will set up rEFInd as your default boot program.\n\n*Run Boot Repair again. This should install the EFI version of GRUB. Note that this path leaves more to chance than the preceding one; at this point you really don't know that the way Boot Repair sets things up will work, whereas you know that rEFInd will boot Ubuntu.\n\n\n\nA: In EFI you normally can also edit the boot priority. If you switch from EFI in Legacy your System will crash. I had the same problem and at the end, the only thing that really helped was to reinstall both systems. The Problem ist that you had install one OS in Legacy and the other one in EFI. I dont think thats working well. So yes, I think you crashed your System\n", "Q: How to connect to wifi using Qualcomm Atheros AR9462 Wireless Network Adapter, for an acer v3 772g machine running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

Ubuntu 16.04 uses the systemd init system, and this config file expresses that these settings should be changed before MongoDB boots up.\nCreate a file named /etc/systemd/system/mongodb-hugepage-fix.service and add the following content:\n[Unit]\nDescription=\"Disable Transparent Hugepage before MongoDB boots\"\n#WARN: check service name on your system\n# If you are using MongoDB Cloud, service name is \"mongodb-mms-automation-agent.service\"\nBefore=mongodb.service      \n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled'\nExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag'\n\n[Install]\n#WARN: check service name on your system\n# If you are using MongoDB Cloud, service name is \"mongodb-mms-automation-agent.service\"\nRequiredBy=mongodb.service\n\nTo load the file into systemd:\nsystemctl daemon-reload\n\nTo activate the file as a boot-time dependency of MongoDB\nsystemctl enable mongodb-hugepage-fix\n\nIf you want to activate the changes immediately (before the next boot)\nsystemctl start mongodb-hugepage-fix\nsystemctl restart mongod\n\nThis solution is not suitable for Ubuntu 14.04, which uses the Upstart init solution instead of systemd. \n\nA: GRUB will change after upgrade, and rc.local will run only after mongo is started, so maybe we should add service mongo restart  at the end of rc.local like this \nif test -f /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled; then\n  echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\nfi\n\nif test -f /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag; then\n   echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag\nfi\n\nwait 1 && servie mongod restart\n\nor maybe someone successfully added the lines above to init script in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: Since we are deploying machines with Ansible I don't like modifying rc files.\nI tried using sysfsutils / sysfs.conf but ran into timing issues when starting the services on fast (or slow machines). It looked like sometimes mongod was started before sysfsutils. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it did not.\nSince mongod is an upstart process I found that the cleanest solution was to add the file /etc/mongo_vm_settings.conf with the following content:\n# Ubuntu upstart file at /etc/init/mongod_vm_settings.conf\n#\n#   This file will set the correct kernel VM settings for MongoDB\n#   This file is maintained in Ansible\n\nstart on (starting mongod)\nscript\n  echo \"never\" > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\n  echo \"never\" > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag\nend script\n\nThis will run the script just before mongod will be started.\nRestart mongod (sudo service mongod restart) and done.\n\nA: After reading a little bit in the warning log I've added these two lines in /etc/sysfs.conf y voilá\nkernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled = never\nkernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag = never\n\nReboot the machine after applying these changes.\n", "Q: Keys are not working properly in ubuntu 14.04, long key press only working I'm using Ubuntu 14.04,Processor Intel® Core™2 Duo CPU P8700 @ 2.53GHz × 2\n.

How can I resolve this issue?\nEDIT: Output of ls /dev/ttyUSB* : \n\n/dev/ttyUSB0    /dev/ttyUSB1    /dev/ttyUSB2\n\nThe modem is /dev/tty/USB2.\n\nA: To fully control your modem, best is to install minicom by using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install minicom\n\nthen look which device your modem is using by:\nls /dev/ttyUSB*\n\nand configuring minicom by:\nsudo minicom -s\n\nand selecting serial port setupEnter and entering the ttyUSBx you found earlier where x is your modem.  Then save the set-up and exit.\nNow you're ready to communicate directly to your modem...  to do this start minicom by executing:\nminicom\n\nand type ATEnter.  If the modem is ready and working, it should respond with OK.  If that does not work, go back to configuring minicom and change the BAUD rate until it works. (look up the maximum BAUD rate of your modem in its manual)\nThe full Huawei AT command set can be found in this document.\n", "Q: Taking more time for svn ci/commit I am doing a real time project.

My client machine(which is a desktop) has PXE capabilities for sure with wake on LAN.\nIs there anyone who tried this or similar sort of things.\n\nA: Are you sure the macbook is handling the DHCP request and not your router? This is important because you have to set some options in your DHCP configuration which makes clients connect to the PXE server.

How can I do this?\nThanks for help.\nBR\n\nA: I don't know whether this is \"simple\" enough for you, but it can be done using tools already included in the system.\n\nThis can be easily accomplished using the chmod and chown commands. With chown you can set the ownership of files and directories and with chmod you can set permissions.\nAs you may want multiple users to access a single directory, you'd have to create a user group for it and add users to it:\ngroupadd g_project_1\nuseradd -G g_project_1 user_1\n#Repeat useradd for every user who is to access project_1\n\nNow you set the ownership group of project_1 to g_project_1 (I don't know whether it's necessary, but you may want to keep www-data as the ownership user of the directory) so you'd execute this command:\nchgrp g_project_1 project_1\n\nNow you need to set the directory permissions to 0770 (rwx* for the user, rwx for the group and no access for others):\nchmod 0770 project_1\n\nTo ensure files and directories inside receive the same ownership at creation, also execute the following command:\nchmod g+s project_1\n\nDo this analogously for other project directories and users. Please try it on one dummy project first, it may well be that I made a mistake...\n* Executable permission on a directory controls whether someone can enter it (cd), whereas reading permission controls seeing its contents (ls)\n", "Q: Ubuntu File and folder permissions sudo chmod -R 777 /opt/lampp/htdocs\noutput is \nchmod: changing permissions of ....  Operation not permitted\nI want to give every permission to htdocs and all its sub-folders and to every file on all the sub-folders  .\nThanks\n\nA: I'd rather recomment you to have different permissions for directories and files, because you'll need to run some commands inside of directory (like ls, cp, cat etc.), and they require \"executable\" permission.\nAt the same time I strongly recommend you to add \"executable\" bit only to that files, that should be executable - some scripts, commands, etc. \nYou may use the following scheme to set permissions on files&directories separately:\nsudo find . -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \\;\n\nfor directories\nsudo find . -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \\;\n\nfor files,\nInstead of ‘.’ you may use the full path to needed file or directory. 775 & 664 - are binary-written permissions. More information about them you may receive there - http://linuxcommand.org/lts0070.php\nIf you'd like to provide full permissions on files and directories, you may perform the following:\nsudo find /opt/lampp/htdocs -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \\;\n\nfor directories\nsudo find /opt/lampp/htdocs -type f -exec chmod 666 {} \\;\n\nfor files.\nAlso take care about owner:group_owner parameters, they're also important for you. \n", "Q: How to restrict write/read access to HDD for certain apps I have an old secondary internal HDD installed in my desktop PC on which I primarily do backups.

After I unmounted the HDD my PC's performance dramatically increased. I really want the backups to be automatic and at the moment thats impossible since the drive needs to stay unmounted the whole time unless I plan on using it.

Or is there a setting I need to modify to prevent the old HDD from slowing the system down? Thanks for any help in advance.\n\nA: Even though you discourage it, my suggestion is to modify your backup-script to automatically mount your disc before running backup and unmount it afterwards.\nThere are other possibilities, which may or may not work in your case, depends on circumstances:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you running your backup as root?\n\n*Where are you mounting second HDD\n\n*Do you need to have access to this mount point for any other reason than running backup?\n\n*What kind ob backuping software do you run?\n\n\n\nSuggested script:\n#!/bin/bash\ngvfs-mount -d /your/device/file\ndeja-dup\ngvfs-mount -u \"/media/cube/Backup HDD\"\n\n", "Q: Lost my Unity sidebar / dock I did a quite drastic removal of packages from my Ubuntu, and seem to have lost the sidebar / dock in Unity.

You get there by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1. You get back to the graphical surface (TTY7) with Ctrl+Alt+F7. In the TTY, you have to login first by manually entering your username and password.

On my SSD I have installed Windows 8.1, and my HDD's sole purpose is to hold some data. I needed access to Ubuntu, so I installed in on a pendrive and it's working fine if I've choosen booting in Legacy mode (and put pendrive before SSD with Windows bootloader). However, it doesn't work in UEFI mode at all.\nI don't want to use this Legacy mode, as I want my Windows to be available ASAP and UEFI simply works faster. However, I want my Ubuntu start if this pendrive is attached to my laptop. During installation I showed that I want to have bootloader installed on my pendrive.\nWhat can I do?\nMy version - Ubuntu 14.04LTS.\n\nA: First, be aware that Windows 8 uses various tricks to reduce boot time. One of these is to turn shutdown operations into suspend-to-disk actions, which enables faster startup. The problem with this is that filesystems are left in an unclean state; only Windows (indeed, only the specific instance of Windows that was most recently \"shut down\") can safely access the filesystem. Dual-booting in such a configuration is unsafe, since the EFI System Partition (ESP), which holds boot loaders, is affected. It gets worse if you try to access the Windows partition or any shared data partition from Linux. To safely manage a dual boot of Windows 8 or later and Linux, you must disable this \"fast startup\" feature, as described here (among many other places).\nSecond, you can boot a BIOS-mode Linux installation by setting up an EFI-mode boot loader. In the case of your installation on a flash drive, you can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an EFI System Partition (ESP) on your flash drive and install whatever EFI boot loader you like on there as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. You'll then need to use your firmware's built-in boot manager to select the USB flash drive to boot, much as you'd do if you wanted to run an Ubuntu installer.\n\n*Install your EFI boot loader of choice on the hard disk's ESP. You'll have to configure it to boot the kernel from the USB flash drive, or at least to boot a kernel from the hard disk's ESP and use the USB flash drive's root (/) filesystem.\n\n\nThe first approach makes your USB flash drive installation easily portable to other systems but may be a little more hassle to use. The second approach means you won't have to monkey with the firmware's boot manager, but you'll be altering your boot path even when you want to boot Windows, which will slightly slow things down.\n", "Q: Can't run genymotion, because \"AMD-V is disabled\" When I'm going to use genymotion, and open a phone I have chosen, it says \"AMD-V is disabled in the BIOS (or by the host OS). (VERR_SVM_DISABLED)\". How can I fix this problem?\n\nA: It is saying what is the problem. All you have to do is enable AMD-V in the BIOS. It is mostly disabled in BIOS. So, reboot the desktop and enter the bios menu. The traditional way is keep on pressing \"Del\" key on the keyboard and you'll be seeing the BIOS screen. If it doesn't work, try F12 or F2 etc.\nOnce you are in the BIOS setup, look for Advanced BIOS settings or something which relates to that phrase. You'll find something related to \"Virtualization\" there. Just move the arrow keys downwards and enable it. After that press F10 to save and exit setup.\n", "Q: dpkg error code So I'm new to ubuntu, everytime I try sudo apt-get install I get this\n ryan@ryan-nBook-4300:~$ sudo apt-get install\n    [sudo] password for ryan: \n    Reading package lists...

Or if you want to just restage the software if you install a later version or such.\n(2): If you want the packages to reinstall their defaults, try sudo dpkg-reconfigure [package] or sudo apt-get purge [package]; sudo apt-get install [package].  purge will force the removal of all configurations.

I have tried slashes, quotes, and double quotes.\nWhen I use slashes, the output states that it is a success but I do not see any transferred files.\nrsync -avz /path\\ with\\ spaces/ user@remotelocation:/media/another\\ path\\ with/spaces/\n\nWhen I use single or double quotes, it tells me that permission is denied after entering my password\nrsync -avz '/path with spaces/' 'user@remotelocation:/media/another path with/spaces/'\n\nWhat can I do?\nThank you.\n\nA: look at rsync option –protect-args (-s), no extra slashes needed\n\nA: Expanding on rzr's answer with example code and references, just add the -s flag, quote the paths, and don't worry about escaping spaces in the remote path:\nrsync -avzs '/path with spaces/' 'user@remotelocation:/media/another path with/spaces/'\n\n\nFor reference, the options specified by the OP:\n\n\n*\n\n*-a, archive mode, equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)\n\n\n*\n\n*Includes:\n\n*-r, --recursive, recurse into directories\n\n*-l, --links, copy symlinks as symlinks\n\n*-p, --perms, preserve permissions\n\n*-t, --times, preserve modification times\n\n*-g, --group, preserve group\n\n*-o, --owner, preserve owner (super-user only)\n\n*-devices, preserve device files (super-user only)\n\n*-specials, preserve special files\n\n\n*-v, --verbose, increase verbosity\n\n*-z, --compress, compress file data during the transfer\n\n\nThe additional parameter needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*-s, --protect-args, no space-splitting, wildcard chars only\n\n\nA: You need to escape spaces in both local shell and remote shell. Try this:\nrsync -avz '/path with spaces/' 'user@remotelocation:/media/another\\ path\\ with/spaces/'\n\nThe source, /path with spaces/ in the local shell can be escaped only via putting single quotes around it i.e. '/path with spaces/'. \nOn the other hand in case of the destination, the local shell is escaped by putting single quotes and the spaces are escaped in the remote shell by using escape character (\\) in front of the spaces.\n", "Q: Dynamic object creation im QML I am new to QML and would like to understand how object creation works when splitting code over different files (as it feels like a good code practice).\nI know I can call property of an item within the same file:\n// MyItem.qml\nItem {\n  id: myItem\n  property string name: \"Myself\"\n\n  onClicked: {\n    console.log(myItem.name)\n  }\n}\n\nbut how do I create an instance of the same item in a different file?\n// Main.qml\nButton {\n  onClicked: {\n    console.log(myItem.name)\n  }\n}\n\nThrows a ReferenceError: name is not defined error which I suppose means: \"can not call property name of an undefined object\".\nIs this common practice in QML (don't see a lot of examples doing this) or does everyone simply put everything in the same file?\n\nA: You do something like:\n// Main.qml\nMyItem {\n    id: thisIsMyItem\n}\nButton {\n    onClicked: console.log(thisIsMyItem.name)\n}\n\nThe idea is that you can use the components you declared in the same document referenced by their id. You call these files \"documents\" in QML.\nAnother thing is that you don't need to use the myItem id in MyItem.qml, you can simply reference the name property with its name. Of course, using the id is necessary when you have multiple components in the same document with the 'name' property.\n// MyItem.qml\nItem {\n    id: myItem\n    property string name: \"Myself\"\n    Item {\n        id: secondItem\n        property string name: \"Second Item\"\n        Component.onCompleted: console.log(\"This item's name is \" + name + \", and parent item's name is \" + myItem.name) \n    }\n}\n\nOne remark: that onClicked in your MyItem.qml would give a syntax error, as Item has no clicked() signal.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: On 14.10, nonstop problems trying to get intel i915 and Nvidia 860M to play together I must have spent 3 total days on this, and I keep running in circles.  Essentially I just want to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the intel i915 drivers as the main display drivers \n\n*Have NVidia drivers installed\n\n*Be able to use CUDA.\n\n\nEarlier I was able to get lucky and get NVidia to be the display driver.  It would lock up once every few minutes, and I had switch to TTY6 then back to TTY7 to get it back.  Then a Ubuntu update happened, and it wouldn't boot to the login prompt.\nAfter hours of trying every option I can think of, I'm trying to start from scratch and remove all NVIDIA stuff and just get it to display in Intel mode.  Just to start from somewhere.  \nI did a full purge of everything nvidia related, I ran as many reinstall tips as I could find online, and it at least boots and lets me log in.  But once I log in, I get a background wallpaper, a mouse pointer, and nothing else.  \nXorg.0.log gives a possibly helpful error:\n(II) LoadModule: \"glx\"\n...\n(EE) failed to load /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xorg/extra-modules/libglx.so: libnvidia-tls.so.331.113: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nAny ideas on what I can try?  How do I get rid of that nvidia thing still in there?  Is there a way to install glx for the i915 intel drivers?  \n\nA: I spent another day on this, and an answer is pretty straightforward.  \n\n\n*\n\n*I did a reinstall of Ubuntu, and doing that installed the i915 drivers but not any NVidia drivers. \n\n*I then grabbed the CUDA drivers by downloading the .run file.  I made sure to run it by adding on this command line option:\n--no-opengl-libs\n    Prevents the driver installation from installing NVIDIA's GL libraries.\n    Useful for systems where the display is driven by a non-NVIDIA GPU.\n    In such systems, NVIDIA's GL libraries could prevent X from loading \n    properly.\n\nIt said it is installing the display driver, but it doesn't appear to do it.  It complains that it had issues with libGLU.so libX11.so libXi.so libXmu.so libGL.so.  That's fine, it seems to mean it didn't install the display drivers.\nI did a reboot, and I was able to build one of the sample projects and verify it works.  Running sudo modprobe i915 and sudo modprobe nvidia both worked without errors.  \nWhat I avoided was trying to install the cuda drivers through apt-get or getting updated cuda drivers through the edgers repository. I saw this option recommended often, but it caused me nonstop problems.  At least on this laptop, all Nvidia display drivers through apt-get would have the display hang every few minutes and I'd have to context switch between TTY1 back to TTY7 to get it back.  I could at least use the NVidia prime tool to switch back to the intel driver.  But every time I switched back to intel, sudo modprobe nvidia gave errors.  I also struggled to undo many of my setting changes.  Each time one attempt failed, I just reinstalled Ubuntu to start fresh and tried again.\nI don't plan on doing heavy graphic gaming on this laptop, so this solution works for me.  \n\nA: I am answering this one 'gingerly'  From my own experience(I have a fairly high-end desktop) if you have an nvidia card installed, you will most likely have not one, but two separate places where you can plug in your monitor(s)  One is for the nvidia card.  The other is for the intel graphics(being a part of your motherboard...does that make sense to you?)  This means plugging your monitor into the nvida port will leave the intel graphics unreachable.  If I am wrong, will someone please correct me on these points?\n", "Q: Corsair Padlock USB does not list under /dev/sd* \nI have a Corsair Padlock USB Thumbdrive that used to work fine but it does not mount to Ubuntu 14.04 anymore.\nIt shows up with lsusb command, also with dmesg and /var/log/syslog file however it is not assigned a /dev/sdX.\nThis is an encrypted USB drive with pin code entry buttons on it.

Ubuntu just freezes randomly. It begins with a previous version of Ubuntu (al least 14.02) but maybe it begins before. I believed this would have been corrected quick but nothing happens. So am I alone to get this problem ?\nUbuntu totally freezes. (Screen freezes with no black screen)\nNo keyboard. No mouse. All key shortcuts (REISUB ...) just fails. \nSometimes firefox is opened, sometimes it is not. I dont know how to find where it comes from. What logfile would be useful for debug?\nConfiguration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel core I5 2500K\n\n*P8P67 Rev B\n\n*Geforce GTX560Ti\n\n*Samsung SSD drive\n\n*8gb RAM\n\n*Dual boot (Windows)\n\n\nCtrl+Alt+F1 have no effect on the computer. The screen remains totally frozen. I get these random freezes with ubuntu 12.xx as well.\nI tried several (4) Nvidia drivers but for all configurations I get freezes. This is so annoying !!\nRandom freeze means that I can run linux for some minutes then the system freezes and I can not do anything, except restart.\n\nA: Could you please try to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 the next time it happens?\nIf you are able to see a black screen with white font you are able to use the \"screen\" as a CLI. \nLogin and then try to execute the command \"kill -9 -1\". \nAdd the result to your question. \n\nA: I have had this problem, seemed to be related to Nvidia drivers.  I did a ctrl+alt+f1 then a cltr+alt+f7 to get it back.\n\nA: I think what you are facing is a very elusive bug.  I had the same issue for a while.  I thought it might be the nVidea graphics card, but when I got my new computer, it had the same problem with an Intel graphics card.\nI went back to 12.04 on my new computer and left 14.04 on my old desktop. I discovered that some time after I have been on the internet, sometimes between minutes and about two hours, the computer would systematically freeze up.  First, I may or may not notice the mouse getting sluggish, then, the mouse would not click.  I could move it, but the screen was pretty much frozen.  \nLater, I discovered that I could often break it by pressing ALT-CTRL-DEL and then ENTER.  That would log me out and I could go back in.... sometimes.\nThis ability leads me to think that the graphics is frozen and not the computer.  At least until you have moved the mouse and clicked a bit after it freezes.  \nI also suspected Firefox for a while but discovered the problem occurred with Chrome as well, and also it occurred if I never used the browser.  However, when I moved my email, etc. to my new computer, it ceased to crash unless I accessed the browser.  Later, I left it running without using the browser and eventually checked email with it.  About an hour after setting up email, it froze up again. \nI since disconnected it from the internet so it could do some disk rescue.  It ran continuously for four days - a record!   Once I connected it and did the updates, it crashed within 2 hours.  \nI am not the expert, but the way I interpret my experience is that there is a bug that is somehow related to connecting to the internet.  The more I access the net, the more likely it is to occur.  The first effect I sometimes see is the mouse stall a little. Then, the OS no longer updates the screen, just the mouse.  Finally, the whole system freezes.  It isn't directly related to nVidea unless it is also related to Intel graphics (different drivers.)  It isn't related to Firefox, Chrome or Thunderbird.  But, I may have not ruled out any association with updates.  It definitely seems to be related with connecting to the internet.   \nI recently re-purposed my 14.04 drive so I no longer have 14 installed.  \nI changed back to 12.04 where I no longer have the problem.  \nIf you search for 14.04 freeze, I think you will find a lot of others having similar problems, but no solution.  \nI hope that the information I just gave can be used by someone who knows a lot more about programming/debugging Ubuntu to help find the solution.\n", "Q: Intel pro 5100 AGN wireless connection problem Hello ladies and centlemen.\nI recently grow an interest about Ubuntu OS.

A username and password would work if there's a solution with that but I could just not tell anyone about how to access it while he downloaded the files.\n\nA: Dropbox or another file sharing service would be one easy way. \nYou could try python simple HTTP server as well.\nOpen up a terminal and type:\n$ cd /home/somedir\n$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\nThat's it! Now your http server will start in port 8000. You will get the message:\nServing HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...\n\nThen they can point their browser to 24.Your.IP:8000\nCrude, but simple.  (You may need to install Python though).\n\nA: Best approach seems to be a SSH server. Basic introduction and setup instructions here.\nBenefits:\n\n*\n\n*They get remote access to their files when they need; (if the HDD is connected to powered computer)\n\n*The file transfers are secure;\n\n*Particular files can be transferred.\n\nYou need to install SSH server, configure it, create an user account for the remote party, mount the USB disk in the home directory the new account. Bonus reading: configure public key-based login credentials.\nAlso you have to configure your side of the Internet connection to allow traffic from remote computers to the computer where SSH server is running.\nWhen you have this the remote party can use Putty SSH client (this is Windows application) to access your SSH server with the user credentials of the new user.\n", "Q: Broken Sudo and no write privilige on file system I had upgraded ubuntu12.04 to ubuntu14.04 and it didn't boot unless I edited this line in the grub menu\nlinux ${rel-dirname}/${basename} root=${lINUX_HOST_DEVICE} loop=${loop_file_relative} ro ${args} \n\nfrom ro to rw but I didn't save this change and boot by press F10.

Rebooted, then booted straight to Ubuntu. Used Bootable Windows 7 USB and fixed the MBR in command prompt. Then rebooted and it booted straight to Windows, no Ubuntu option, used Live Ubuntu and installed and ran Boot-Repair this worked, but after reboot I finally got grub, but it only shows ubuntu.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/10612519/\nHope someone can help me out, really would love to be able to learn how to use linux and maybe use it standalone in the future.\n\nA: I have encountered quite a lot cases where Windows wouldn't boot any more after the alongside installation of Ubuntu.

No grub on sda I installed Windows 8 on sda and I installed Xubuntu on sdb, but I don't like using Ubuntu grub to change sda mbr. I like to use a simple F12 solution for dual boot. How can I remove grub on sda and install grub only on sdb?\nWhat should I do? \nWhen I boot Windows 8 on sda, I don't want to see any grub screen.\n\nA: The easiest way to accomplish this is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot with the Windows 8 repair disk\n\n*Repair sda\n\n*Use the BIOS to boot\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem with Windows 8 and Ubuntu. To install grub into sdb you have to choose the partition to install boot-loader as sdb. Since you already installed Xubuntu, you can use Boot-Repair tool to reinstall grub on sdb.\nHaving said that, neither during installation nor with Boot-Repair I could manage to place grub on sdb. No matter what I choose they placed grub on EFI partition in sda. Then I physically disconnected my first HDD (sda), there was no other choice and installer had to place grub on sdb. You can also try creating a second EFI partition on sdb during installation and see if that works out.\nRemoving grub from sda is tricky. For me, fixmbr did not solve the problem since it only reinstalls Windows boot manager. You may have to go and manually delete grub on EFI partition. Otherwise It will just copy itself to BIOS in every restart.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*run command line on Windows as administrator\n\n*run diskpart tool\n\n*list volume\nAfter this, it will list your hard drives. Select the one your OS's are on.\n\n\n*\n\n*select volume 0 (0 for first hard drive etc.)\n\n*list partition\n\n*select partition 0 (select EFI partition, usually first partition. So 0. EFI partition should be the one no letter assigned to it)\n\n*assign letter=Z (or some other letter, this makes EFI partition visible in Windows explorer)\n\n*exit (exit diskpart)\n\n\nNow you have run explorer as administrator to access EFI drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*taskkill /im explorer.exe /f (kill explorer)\n\n*explorer.exe restart explorer as administrator\n\n\nNow you can go to your Drive Z: (EFI partition) and delete ubuntu folder which contains grub.\nAt the end, start diskpart again repeat the same procedure to remove letter=Z and make EFI partition invisible again. \n", "Q: LibCurl: how do I compile the example code?

My girlfriend is running Ubuntu 14.04 on her entry level laptop.

If the variable is set to no (or -N/--no-user-group is specified on the command line), useradd will set the primary group of the new user to the value specified by the GROUP variable in /etc/default/useradd, or 100 by default.\n-N, --no-user-group\n  Do not create a group with the same name as the user, but add the user to the group specified by the -g option or by the GROUP variable in /etc/default/useradd.\nThe default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are not specified) is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs.\n\nI believe that what happens is that any user created actually ends up belonging to two different groups, the default one created by omitting -g (which perhaps has read/write permissions on multiple directories) and the one specified by useradd -G $group $user\n\nA: Right I have spent 3 or 4 days trying to sort this out.

I recently installed Ubuntu Utopic 14.04 LTS on a new server box I built specifically to host some virtual machines. The network configuration for this box, which contains two NICs, exposes the two NIC's only through virtual bridges - one to a private network, one to the public-facing Internet. One guest VM will access both bridges via taps, serving as the firewall and gateway for the host in particular and the private network in general. The other VM will simply be a separate guest server on the private network. The host will only directly participate on the private network via the corresponding private bridge.\nAs a result, neither eth0 nor eth1 will only be \"up\" other than the context of their corresponding virtual bridges. When Ubuntu boots, however, I believe upstart's failsafe is incorrectly assuming (insisting?) that at least eth0 be up independently before it will allow the system to get past the 20/40/60 second delays failsafe imposes. Yet the delays have almost no hope of being resolved until boot finishes and the guest VM's are allowed to start unfettered! See the paradox? To be honest, I'm not sure eth0 nor eth1 will ever reach the state failsafe is demanding. \nAt a raw, reactionary level, the frustrated, non-Ubuntu side of me wants to rip out failsafe, because each reboot for a configuration change is forcing me to wait up to two minutes for a status change that I'm 99.9% sure will never happen by design. Bottom line - no failsafe dependency. I'd just like to make the extra hoops I'm realizing failsafe is forcing just go away.\nBy the same token, I'm trying to be at least somewhat open-minded about what Upstart is trying to do with failsafe, as this is my first exposure to it. I've seen some (very vague) info that one approach to this involves changing the way /etc/network/interfaces is set up, moving my bridge setups into their own Upstart tasks, but I would really prefer to leave my interface definitions alone, happy, and working. \nSo, what are my choices? Can I just eliminate the failsafe tasking, or modify it to change its conditions? If so, how? Must I hack up my interfaces file?\n\nA: First, let me apologize for answering my own question. \nSecond, I have, in fact, conquered the failsafe.conf startup delay problem. While I realize there's been no torrent of activity on this question, I've seen enough activity on various other threads about similar failsafe/boot delay problems that I'm posting my research and solution for the benefit of others in a similar pickle.\nOverview\nAs noted in the initial post, the problem as I saw it was one where the failsafe upstart job was imposing an unwanted constraint on the booting of my system. I then researched the issue further, found out why failsafe was behaving as it was.\nAnalysis \nBy default, failsafe.conf defines a start condition that effectively fires it at boot time (as soon as filesystem and the loopback interface are available), and defines one of two possible stop conditions:\nstart on filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=lo\nstop on static-network-up or starting rc-sysinit\n\nFailsafe's insistence upon the delays arose by virtue of neither 'stop' event firing. The second condition, rc-sysinit, is one of the final system initialization tasks upstart runs, which has its own start condition \nstart on (filesystem and static-network-up) or failsafe-boot\n\nWith failsafe not stopping, it's apparent rc-sysinit is not starting. Failsafe will emit the failsafe-boot event once its timeouts expire. Given failsafe has started, 'filesystem' is implied, thus leaving the sole remaining condition common to both events being 'static-network-up'. Failsafe is running because it doesn't think any network interfaces are 'up.'\nThe cause\nWorking backward through /etc/network/if-up.d, an upstart script is defined that iterates through all the network interfaces defined in /etc/network/interfaces defined with an \"auto\" qualifier, meaning that interface is to be brought up at boot time. The definition of how an interface is considered 'up' becomes an important semantic issue I'll describe later.\nIf and only if all \"auto\"-configured interfaces are 'up', the upstart script will emit the famed 'static-network-up' event. That would, in turn, allow rc-sysinit to fire and terminate failsafe - hence the root cause of my problem. None of my network interfaces have an IP address at boot time - by design. But 'static-network-up' doesn't abide the idea of an interface being 'up' without an IP address, hence failsafe hangs until timeouts expire.\nFor my situation, I slave the two physical NIC's in the box to bridges and expose them via taps to two different VM's. One VM serves up DHCP across one tap, the other is just a server on the same network. For the bridges to function properly as tapped by the VM's, the NIC's must at least be \"UP\", passively allowing packets through. Hence, 'auto' seemed appropriate in /etc/network/interfaces. It was not appropriate, however, in the eyes of failsafe, hence the only solution had to be one that abided failsafe's semantics.\nThe solution to my problem, then, was twofold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the 'auto' declaration from every network interface I'd defined (other than loopback).  \n\n*Create upstart jobs to bring up the previously \"auto\" interfaces \"manually.\"\n\n\nI defined one job four each of four devices - two taps and two virtual bridges - by mimicking a solution provided here. \nIn this configuration, with no 'auto' interfaces, the networking script should now immediately emit 'static-network-up', thus forcing failsafe to terminate. A final modification required me to add a \"post-up\" clause to each tap's interface definition to call 'brctl' and create the corresponding virtual bridge, previously done as part of the 'auto' configuration.\nSo, my /etc/network/interfaces (in part) now looks like:\n#auto tpRED  (commented out)\n  iface tpRED inet manual\n  pre-up /usr/sbin/tunctl -t tpRED\n  post-up /sbin/brctl addbr brRED\n\n#auto brRED\n  iface brRED inet manual\n  bridge_ports eth1 tpRED\n  bridge_hw xx:yy:aa:bb:cc:dd\n\nThe acid test\nThe acid test? Reboot the server. And when I did, the failsafe timeout was gone, and my network came up in a functionally identical configuration. IT WORKS!! I just wish we had a better handle on the semantics of an \"UP\" network interface!! \n", "Q: How to I parse a file and only keep certain words?

I've been foolish over the years and created a few OpenPGP keys for various reasons (mostly self teaching) and never revoked any of them or changed them etc before re-installs or whatnot. \nAnyhow I was wondering if there was a way to fix my mistakes,  I have a list of all the previous keys I've used on Ubuntu's keyserver and was wondering if there was a way to re-import and revoke them or are they a lost cause.\nI've since learned my errors and abide by a strict backup/revoke policy now.\n\nA: It depends on whether you still have the private key, or not.\n\n\n*\n\n*Having access to the private key:\nYou're lucky, and will be able to revoke the key. It is as easy as running gpg --edit-key [key-id]. Inside the edit menu, run revkey. Import the revocation certificate if needed (gpg --import [file]), and send it to the key servers (gpg --send-keys [key-id]).\n\n*Having no access to the private key:\nThis is very bad, as you're now not the key owner any more, but an \"evil attacker\".\nShort answer: You're out of luck an will not be able to remove the keys, they will stay forever.\nLong answer, with some perspective:\n\n\n*\n\n*In future times, it might be possible to brute-force old RSA 1024 keys within a reasonable amount of computing time. But don't expect this happen soon. Quantum computers might change this situation, once they actually arrive.\n\n*There is another thing you can do to at least hint that you're not using these keys any more: OpenPGP knows so-called designated revocations, where a key may be revoked by another one. You could use your newest key to generate such revocations, but be aware these will not really be valid (as the old keys very likely did not specify your new one as designated revoker). But other users might observe this and draw their own conclusions. In the end, it's the best thing you can do.\n\n\n\nAnyway: you're nor alone, this happens to a lot of people. If the keys do not have any certifications, it's pretty safe to ignore them anyway, as anybody could have created fake keys for your name (and even key ID).\nGnuPG 2.1 automatically generates revocation certificates together with new keys. Make sure to generate one manually if using an older version, and also make sure to have a save backup of this certificate: I recommend creating a QR code (qrencode is helpful here) and print it on a piece of paper you could also hand over to a trusted person (the only thing that could happen is this person maliciously revokes your key, but cannot gain further access).\n", "Q: External USB hard drive, WD Elements, not power off itself I own a Seagate Free Agent external hard drive for last 4-5 years. After plugged in and finished with file transfers I will click menu 'Safely remove'. Then it will gracefully shut down itself, stopping spinning of disk inside. I can feel it if touched. Also, power light will be also off.\nRecently I bought a new external hard disk, WD Elements. If I issue 'Safely remove' for this hard drive, it just get unmounted, but not powering off itself, also the disks continue spinning, I can feel when touched. I also tried 'Power off the drive' button in 'Disks' application comes with Ubuntu. Then also, it just get unmounted only.\nI would like see the WD Elements hard drive gracefully shutdown itself, before I manually unplug it. I assume forcefully unplugging the device before it stops itself may shorten its lifespan.\nIs there any other command or program that will help me to do it? \n\nA: You need an additional package that contains a utility to actually power off the WD as WD does not support Linux out of the box:\nsudo apt-get install usdisks2\nsudo udisksctl power-off --block-device /dev/XdY\n\nwhere X and Y are the letters corresponding to your disk. \n\nA: So far I haven't found a simple alternative to \"safely eject\" in the file manager, so this is my justification for using command line here.\nFirst , you'd need to find out your external hard-drives device id or block id. Then you can use either udisks or udisksctl to unmount and actually power off the device. I have answered related question some time ago , when just started out with ubuntu, so I suggest you refer to it as well. Basically , i use udisks --unmount /dev/sdb1 && udisks --detach /dev/sdb where sdb1 is the mount-point and sdb is the actual disk.\nYou can use lsblk and identify it by mount-point and size; on the other hand, you can use udisksctl status. For instance, I have a Sandisk Cruiser usb drive connected right now. The output of the commands is the following:\n\nAs you can see both report that my usb drive is identified as /dev/sdc. Each time you pugin a usb device it will be identified with different letters, sdb, sdc,sdf and so forth, while sda is always your hard-drive.\nSo in my case , I would eject the usb with udisks --unmount /dev/sdc1 && udisks --detach /dev/sdc or alternatively with what Fabby suggested. With the one-liner I use, I've noticed that the device id is preserved, i.e, if i eject the usd and reconnect it, it still gives the device sdc name.\nTIP: you can use udisksctl status | grep -i wd to show only information for the external hard drive.\nNow, here's something I've done purely for fun, but you could find it useful and adapt to your own needs. What if we could write a script to do the safe-ejecting for us ? \nWe'd need to let the shell know the block id of out external hdd or usb. What would be the output of this command : udisksctl status | grep -i sandisk | xargs echo ? It would be  this: SanDisk Cruzer Glide 1.27 2005425573077FA0AA67 sdd, or in other words information about the usb , delimited by spaces, with the device id being last argument, or the 6th one. Here we can use cut command to extract it like so: udisksctl status | grep -i sandisk | xargs echo | cut -d' ' -f6\nOf course for you, you'd have to use udisksctl status | grep -i wd  | xargs echo and count which element is your block id is, and then use appropriate number on cut -d' ' -fx\nNext , I've put together the script remove-usb.sh. Here it is:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nDEVICE=$( udisksctl status | grep -i sandisk | xargs echo | cut -d' ' -f6 )\n\n\nudisks --unmount /dev/$(echo $DEVICE)1 && udisks --detach /dev/$DEVICE\n\nNext, placed it in my /home/user/bin folder, chmod +x /home/user/bin/remove-usb.sh. Don't forget to have that bin folder to be added to your path. Now you can also create a .desktop file or make script executable in the file manager \nAnd here's the script in action\n\n\nA: Following shell script do the job for me.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nDEVICE=$(udisksctl status | grep -i \"WD Elements\" | xargs echo | cut -d' ' -f6)\n\nudisks --unmount /dev/$(echo $DEVICE)1\nsudo udisksctl power-off --block-device /dev/$DEVICE\n\nIt is actually combination of ideas from posts of both @Serg and @Fabby.\n", "Q: skype install on ubuntu 14.04 dependency hell im trying to install skype since empathy and pidgin doesnt work so im stuck in the installation, anything seems to work, i tried using synaptics, gdeb with the packages from the page, even tried everything in  here too\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2229249\nbut nothing seems to work!\nlibqtwebkit4:i386 : Depends: libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 o\n                              libgl1:i386\n                     Depends: libqt4-opengl:i386 (>= 4:4.5.3) but wont be intalled\nanyone has an idea to what can i do?\nof course i already tried \nsudo apt-get -f install too\n\nA: Don't make it too much complex.

I ran up against this question, and i found it quite interesting.\nWhile researching for that, i found out that a solution had been posted already here on AskUbuntu, plus multiple times on StackOverflow and on Unix & Linux, but all the solutions provided involved the use of xclip or xsel, which are not available in a default Ubuntu installation (i.e. they're not present in a Live DVD, for example).\nQuestion: How to copy the stdout of a command to the clipboard in a default Ubuntu installation?\n\nA: Copy stdout to the clipboard without installing additional software\nAlthough it seemed impossible to me at first (and it is a bit of a detour), it is very well possible without additional software. The only thing needed is python, like it is installed from a fresh install.\nThis solution uses python's ability to copy text to the clipboard, and make it available to other applications, as explained (a.o.) here.\nThe construction\n\n\n*\n\n*The first step is to create an empty textfile, let's say terminal_log.txt\n\n*The command(s) that run in the terminal are followed by | tee /path/to/terminal_log.txt, e.g.\npwd | tee /path/to/terminal_log.txt\n\nThe output will be in the terminal, as well as written to terminal_log.txt\n\n*Meanwhile, a script (see below) runs in the background, detecting changes to the file\n\n*If the file is changed, the change will be copied to the clipboard\n\n\nThe result of the example above:\npwd | tee /path/to/terminal_log.txt\n\nIf I open gedit and press Ctrl+V\n/home/jacob/Desktop\n\nHow to setup\n\n\n*\n\n*create an empty (log-) file, terminal_log.txt\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file.

I realized that my server has many processes runned by lightdm:\n\nCan i killall processes from lightdm?\nIs sudo killall -u lightdm safe?\n\nA: lightdm is the X display manager for Ubuntu and killing the processes will effectively disable the graphical user interface of your system.

The tabs in Ubuntu (Xubuntu 14.04) have a larger font than Firefox. See comparison in attached image. How do I reduce this size?\n\nA: Click with the right button of mouse on the Chrome shortcut and \"Properties\".\nUse this: \nchromium-browser --force-device-scale-factor=0.5\nNow you can scale whatever you want, even bigger shit like factor=2\n:D\n\nA: From here:\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/GCd_JxQ33cU\n\nI found something of a workaround for my own system. You probably know\n  about your ~/.Xdefaults file, Well, it turns out there  is a default\n  value that  helps. Modify the file, and reload using the command xrdb\n  -load ~/.Xdefaults. Then restart Chrome browser,  and, -- voila -- the tab font got larger. The lines I added are as follows: \n!! Xft settings help the problem with small font in google chromium tabs! \n!! Xft.dpi: 96  is the setting that makes the tab font larger \nXft.dpi: 96 \nXft.antialias: true \nXft.rgba: rgb \nXft.hinting: true \nXft.hintstyle: hintslight \n\nI found the above in a thread where people were talking about\n  improving the appearance of fonts in chrome on Linux, and discovered\n  that the 96dpi setting has the side-effect of increasing the font size\n  on the tabs. I should say that I am NOT a font expert, so I cannot\n  guarantee this will work on any system (possible depending on what\n  fonts you have installed?),  but I'd say it is quick and worth a try.\n\n\nA: For window managers that do not handle the font settings correctly, you can use your ~/.Xdefaults file. Set Xft.dpi to e.g. 96:\nXft.dpi: 96\n\nAnd issue the command xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults. Then restart your browser to see the effects of the settings. Tweak the dpi value until you are satisfied.\n\nA: As a Mint user ( using the same Ubuntu packages ) , I've found that everything was fine in Chromium up until 41.0.2272.76-0ubuntu0.14.04.1.1076.

I have google-chrome-stable 41.0.2272.89-1 installed.\n\nA: It may not be exactly what you are expecting, but the Ambiance Theme for Chrome (Maverick) adjusts the font to an acceptable size.\n\n\nA: Install ubuntu unity tweak tool. \nIn appearance secction click fonts and set font scaling factor according to your will.\n\n\nA: You can try to write somewhere like ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini something like this:\n[Settings]\ngtk-font-name=Noto Sans Regular 14\n\n", "Q: Tomcat 8 package in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Do you plan to include Tomcat 8 package in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

I have set up a VPN connection back when I used Unity instead of XFCE as DE for my Ubuntu 14.10. It worked well, but I can't find how I have to connect to it now under XFCE.\nIs there e.g. a panel plugin for XFCE like the one in Unity to accomplish this or do I have to use the terminal or other GUI tools?\n\nA: I have this problem exactly. In 14.04 there was a flaky indicator I could use. It is not available in 14.10. \nIn 14.10 with XFCE4, Settings > Network Connections allows me to set up VPN connections but does not give me the option to connect to any of them. I've looked everywhere for an app offering connections like those offered in the Unity dropdown, but I haven't found one. \nEventually I used nmcli c to get the UUID of the desired connection, then I wrote two CLI scripts, vpnup and vpndown, to toggle the VPN:\n#!\nnmcli con up uuid (UUID)\n[etc...]\n\nThis is easier than switching back and forth to Unity just to change a VPN connection.\n\nA: Edit the file: /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop\nChange the Exec line to read: \nExec=dbus-launch nm-applet\nI don't know why, or if it is related. But my default password mechanism somehow changed. I had to go through all my VPN connection configuration files in:\n/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections \nchanging the line \n\"password-flags=1\" \nto \n\"password-flags=0\" \nThis allows the password to be in the configuration file instead of prompting for the password when the connection is attempted. Then sections and lines had to be added to each configuration file to contain the password:\n[vpn-secrets]\npassword=VPN PASSWORD\nWhere obviously VPN PASSWORD is the password needed for the VPN connection. Once these changes are made in the configuration file, the normal Network Management GUIs can be used to change the password. \nThe changes to nm-applet.desktop and the configuration files provided XFCE4 with the network configuration applet functionality that I found in Unity.\n", "Q: ntfs-3g Failed to decompress file For years the logs of my Ubuntu systems sharing drives with a Windows installation have been routinely flooding logs with:\nMar 17 11:00:50 kemosabi ntfs-3g[483]: ntfs_attr_pread error reading '/pub/TL-WN722N_100629.zip' at offset 23138304: 4096 <> -1: Value too large for defined data type \n\nMar 17 11:00:50 kemosabi ntfs-3g[483]: Failed to decompress file: Value too large for defined data type\n\nNot to mention, the inconvenience of not being able to access so many files in the Windows-formatted partitions (esp. the shared doc & media storages for all OSes, which constitute the majority of the hard drive space, naturally).\nThe root cause of this is known: a shortcoming in ntfs-3g for its inability to deal with (Windows 8?)

What's the difference between deploying a juju bundle with quickstart or juju-deployer?\n\nA: Great question! Juju Quickstart is a user-friendly wrapper application around juju-deployer and Juju. Quickstart's purpose in life is to help users get started with Juju as fast as possible by installing Juju (if it's not already installed), giving you a UI to manage your environment definitions, bootstrapping those environments, and getting you a Juju GUI in that environment in the most light weight way possible. The final feature it does is allow you to deploy a bundle from the charmstore (https://jujucharms.com) or a local bundle you've got on disk.\njuju-deployer is a single purpose python tool used to deploy bundles from any location - such as github, launchpad branches, local charm repositories, and/or deployer files. The general purpose of juju-deployer was to be consumed either directly by developers, or to be consumed by applications. It provides a more in depth control of those bundle deployments by supporting things like retry in case of failure. \nJuju Quickstart uses the deployer but wraps it in an easy to use shell as it presents a single way to get going with Juju as its primary goal. \nHowever its important to note that deployer does expose some additional functionality that you wont find in Juju Quickstart - such as deploying directly from GitHub repositories. (this is subject to change)\nExamples:\njuju deployer -c /path/to/my/bundle\njuju quickstart path/to/my/bundle\n\n\njuju deployer -c bundle:mediawiki-single/7\njuju quickstart mediawiki-single/7\n\nCommand Reference \nThis can be found in juju-deployer -h\nusage: juju-deployer [-h] [-c CONFIGS] [-d] [-L] [-u] [-l] [-D] [-T]\n                     [-t TIMEOUT] [-f FIND_SERVICE] [-b] [-S] [-B]\n                     [-s DEPLOY_DELAY] [-e JUJU_ENV] [-o OVERRIDES]\n                     [--series SERIES] [-v] [-W] [-r RETRY_COUNT]\n                     [--ignore-errors] [--diff] [-w REL_WAIT]\n                     [deployment]\n\npositional arguments:\n  deployment\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -c CONFIGS, --config CONFIGS\n                        File containing deployment(s) json config.

I tried following all of the answers to Which log will tell me why my computer shut down? but all I did was find a messages.1 file which had old messages (3 month old). Other than I found the logs of my own sudo grep commands and that was it. \nMy best guess is it shut off when something got too hot but how can I be sure?\nNB: I have next to no real idea what I am doing with the likes of grep and cat and could easily be getting it all wrong. Log files are not exactly home turf either.\n\nA: This is a quite generic question that it's hard to say what going on.\nHowever that approach you mention instructs to check last logs. You have to be too wise about reading the logs, not just greping for specific words like kernel panic, that's really limits your chance the resolve the problem.\nExamples:\n\n*\n\n*PC have power loss, there may be some errors on file system (check with fsck) and No lines on the log inform about normal shut down (ex: no services stopping ...\n\n\n*Check for other related words may help: error, err, kill, warning, alert...\n\n\n*Some grep flags may help much to get the event timing/sequence\n-e add another pattern to the query\n-n show the line number\n-A show lines after match\n-B show lines before match\n-r search recursively in a folder\n-i case insensitive\nAnother approach that could work only on reproducible problem. To verify your assumption about high temp. You can make a script that generate a log by monitoring the temperature.

I've heard that Ubuntu is an Open source project. \nSo, Suppose I've got Windows 8 installed at this time and I want to build the Ubuntu Operating System myself - by compiling each package, and build a custom kernel. \nHow would I compile and convert it into ISO? I'm very confused. \nHow can I achieve this process. And what's the difference between Ubuntu Kernel source and Ubuntu Source? \nI've heard that Ubuntu is divided into several packages - what does the Ubuntu kernel source code as a package do? \n\nA: You have been correctly informed that Ubuntu is indeed an Open Source Project.\nWhile its completely possible to compile each package - and spend the hour(s) it will take to undertake such a task - it's not really recommended for first time users. Judging by the varying levels of questions here - it seems like this would be a good thing for you to explore in a Virtual Machine so you're not going to disrupt a working PC while you explore and learn the wonderous world of building your own Operating System.\nYou can compile and create your own ISO not just with ubuntu - but any distribution of linux that makes its source available to the public. The primary means behind this process is to pick your base system packages (from a debian based distribution - possibly more) and get started building this with remastersys.\nOnce you've completed this process you can then choose an ISO format to build, and thus install your own distribution. However - its likely to cause you problems if you don't know what you're doing. Again - I urge you to use a Virtual Machine to test anything you build by hand out of remastersys before attempting to install on your primary workstation.\nInformation on Remastersys\n\nRemastersys is a tool that extracts the configuration from a running Ubuntu or Debian installation and then turns this into an installable ISO image. This means that you carry out the customisation using the standard tools that you normally use, such as the package management system and GUI configuration tools. When you have everything set up the way you want it, you can clone the system and deploy it. Additionally, you can use Remastersys to make a clone of a working system.\n\nlink to tutorial here\nIf you want to get started by building everything from source - as other users have pointed out there are distributions that are engineered to provide this experience. Such as a stage 1 Gentoo isntallation - where you literally start from a minimal linux instance in ram - and build your base operating system one piece at a time. The entire process can take up to a day if it's your first run through - and its not uncommon to encounter strange and cryptic error messages that will require deeper learning about the process you're undertaking.\nWhat is the difference between the Kernel Source and Ubuntu Source?\nThis could mean one of three things, and I will attempt to cover all paths.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Kernel source is the official linux kernel source distributed by the core kernel team headed by Linus Torvalds. This is often referred to as a \"vanilla kernel\". \n\n*The \"Ubuntu Source\" may refer to Canonicals fork of the kernel which we keep up to date with patches, vendor hardware stacks (called HWE - shorthand for Hardware Enablement), and other customizations that help Ubuntu to perform and behave in the way you would expect Ubuntu to behave.\n\n*Or the \"Ubuntu Source\" could mean the thousands of packages we have available - which range from basic system utilities like Dash (or Bash), to a full GUI Desktop environment like Unity - which is in reality a meta-package, consisting of several micro-services and components that make up the interactive desktop on Ubuntu. \nWhat does the kernal source code as a package do?\nMost packages you encounter in Ubuntu will be binary distributions. Meaning they are pre-compiled for your CPU architecture, and shipped ready to run with zero compilation required by your machine. This speeds up installation, and gives you a sane set of defaults to consume. \nSome packages, such as linux-headers - distribute the source code for use in compiling other packages. And this can be required to install things like kernel modules, building developer-level packages, or installing the bleeding edge package from a project that requires the linux headers as other code includes. (if you need more information on this subject, I encourage you to find a getting started with programming guide, and give that a thorough read through)\nHopefully this has answered your tiers of questions - and you feel armed with enough information to get moving. Again - please use caution with this advice if you choose to build your own flavor of an Operating System. It's taken teams of people a varying amount of time to build a robust operationg system such as Ubuntu. While its a great learning experience - it's certainly not for everyone.\n", "Q: how to install xampp on ubuntu 14 without using terminal I am new to ubuntu.\n I am wondering is there any way to install xampp on ubuntu without using terminal and software -center. I mean can we install it using package repository for simple installation or make .sh file executable to install it simply like windows\n.\n\nA: No. The creator of XAMPP only supplies a command line installer. It is a 3rd party software so if they do not offer a debian installer you will not be able to install it from Ubuntu Software Center.\nThe better option would be to install our native LAMP. It is superior to XAMPP and tailor made for Ubuntu. If you want to install the task for this the easiest method would be to copy this over to a terminal and have it execute... \nsudo apt-get install lamp-server^\n\nThis will install Apache, MySQL, PHP and also configure it for you. All you need to supply is a password for MySQL and you'll have a running local webserver in a manner of minutes. \n\nsimply like windows .\n\nUbuntu is NOT Windows. Both have their pros and cons. One of the cons is the simple method of installing. That is what leads to all those nasty virusses and unwanted popups. \n\nwithout using terminal and software -center\n\nEverything will need to be installed using apt-get either from terminal or USC.

I have an old Macbook 3.1 with a broken disk drive.  I was going to throw it to the trash when I found EFIs boot great solution which works from USB pendrive.  I was able to install Ubuntu 64bits on it but the issue is that running a 64 OS in a computer with 1G of mem is really low performance.\nThe question is, WHY there is no EFI/BOOT available in any of the 32bits images available?

I am interested in running Lubuntu 32 bits.  \nI did try building my own /EFI/BOOT/BOOTIA32.EFI based on some old post but no luck so far.\nthanks in advance,\nHector\n\nA: I can't speak to the thinking of the Canonical team that makes these decisions, but my understanding is that it all boils down to the Frankeinstein-monster nature of Ubuntu installation media (and Linux installation media generally). In brief, Linux distribution maintainers don't like creating more installation media images than they must, so they go to great lengths to create images that can be burned to CD-R or written to USB flash drives; and that can boot in both BIOS mode and in EFI mode. Doing this means that they have to take advantage of quirks of these various media, and the whole thing barely hangs together. The trouble with 32-bit EFI support is that one of these contortions (providing multiple El Torito images) pushes many middle-aged 32-bit BIOSes past their breaking points. In other words, a 32-bit BIOS/EFI boot medium won't work on many BIOS-based computers. Thus, to support a 32-bit EFI installation, the distribution would need to create a separate boot image specifically for that target. For more on the technical details, see Matthew Garrett's blog post on the subject.\nAs a practical matter, see this question/answer for some pointers on getting a 32-bit EFI-mode installation started:\n32-Bit UEFI Boot Support\nIt can be done (I've done it several times myself), but it's not very well-documented.\n\nA: I have some easy instructions for creating a 32-bit install medium with a 32-bit EFI bootloader:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/715843/463546\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 does not autoboot My Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't autoboot, I've to manually select the default grub item.\nMy /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=2\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nI tried to add this line:\nGRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=$GRUB_TIMEOUT\n\nor\nGRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=0\n\nand make a sudo update-grub nothing happens.\nI also tried to edit /etc/grub.d/00_header overwritting the make_timeout() function changing timeout=-1 with timeout=1, but nope :(\nFinally I tried to restore the defaults with dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc, and nothing.\nAny idea?\n\nA: Try to comment all GRUB_HIDDEN.

Do you have VirtualBox or any other similar software to test the disc with? If not, install it and test the disc for DEFECTS. \nProcedure to check the disc for defects:\n1) Place the Ubuntu disc into the CD/DVD drive.\n2) Wait for the Ubuntu boot screen and press ANY key (I use space though).

Your problem is that you're trying to run Kubuntu, which has the highest sytems requirements of any *buntu edition, on a computer that has only an Intel Atom processor. For a normal performance on a computer with an Intel Atom processor, you should use a more lightweight *buntu edition like Xubuntu 32-bit or Lubuntu 32-bit. Xubuntu 32-bit should run fine on your computer. Lubuntu 32-bit is even more lightweight, similar in its systems requirements to Windows XP.\nIf you don't mind waiting until the official Ubuntu MATE 15.04 is released this April, then I will switch gears and recommend Ubuntu MATE 15.04 instead of Xubuntu because it has better default apps for what you are doing including Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreOffice, VLC, Rhythmbox and the Ubuntu Software Center. Lubuntu 15.04, Xubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu MATE 15.04 all have similar minimum systems requirements.\n", "Q: Move windows between screens in dual screen mode I have a laptop and a 27 inch monitor.

I am using the bridge in order to simulate poor network conditions to everything attached to the \"other side\" of the bridge.\nI was able to ping and ssh into a device through the bridge, but wget would not work.\nI tried disabling IPv6 as described here with no luck.  I also tried messing around with the mtu settings, but had no luck.\nWhat finally worked for me was to use the native Ethernet port on the laptop as one of the bridge interfaces, and use the dongle as the second port in the bridge.  Once I did this, everything worked fine.  So for me, the issue is a bug in the driver for the interfaces that I was using.\n", "Q: ubuntu hotspot wifi for captive portal and authentication via sms I'm trying to install GRASE HotSpot on Ubuntu 14.04lts to realize an hotspot wifi for the captive portal and using sms for authentication users. \nBut during the installation I've received that error:\n$: sudo apt-get install grase-www-portal grase-conf-freeradius grase-conf-squid3 grase-conf-openvpn\nReading package lists...

I tested it on LIVE USB with the daily build and my DWA-582 works fine now.\nSince the Linux kernel v4.4 included with Ubuntu 16.04 is also included in Ubuntu 14.04.5 it should be enough to run a full upgrade of Ubuntu 14.04:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt full-upgrade\n\nIf you only want to install the newer kernel (or make sure that it was actually installed during the full upgrade) run:\nsudo apt install linux-generic-lts-xenial\n\n\nA: I had exactly the same problems with my D-link DWA-582, but the other answers didn't work out for me.\nI uninstalled the Ubuntu network-manager and installed wicd (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WICD) as I read somewhere some problems could be caused by the network manager.

I tried to sort the content of a file in Ubuntu desktop 14.04 (Trusty Tahr). In my case, the expected result should be same as original content, but the actual result is not. Why?\n# cat test.txt\na++-a\na++-b\na++-c\nab\nac\n\n# cat test.txt | sort\na++-a\nab\na++-b\nac\na++-c\n\n\nA: Sort uses alphabetical and numeric sorting, same as us, special characters like + - < > ... are ignored, numbers are treated numerical so 1, 2, 3..  comes before 11, 12 1066 1104 -- see!\nSo your list is seen as: aa,  ab, ab, ac, ac\n\nA: You could use LC_ALL variable, set it to LC_ALL=C before calling sort\n$ LC_ALL=C sort test.txt\na++-a\na++-b\na++-c\nab\nac\n\nRead this answer, if you want to know what is this magically LC_ALL=C. Here is short summary:\n\nThe C locale is a special locale that is meant to be the simplest locale. You could also say that while the other locales are for humans, the C locale is for computers. In the C locale, characters are single bytes, the charset is ASCII, the sorting order is based on the byte values.\n\nAlso, as @KenMollerup pointed, quote from man sort\n   ***  WARNING  ***  The locale specified by the environment affects sort\n   order.  Set LC_ALL=C to get the traditional sort order that uses native\n   byte values.\n\nSo when using sort with LC_ALL=C, sort compare symbols bytewise. Otherwise sort will ignore all non alphanumerical characters.\n", "Q: Will an update to Chrubuntu damage Chrome OS? I am running Chrome OS 40 and Ubuntu 12.04 on my Toshiba Chromebook 2. I was wondering if updating to Ubuntu 14.04 will update my kernel and break Chrome OS. I've almost updated before, but then I stopped myself after it said something about \"kernel updates\". I know Chrome OS uses the Linux kernel, but I don't know if it uses the latest version. I really want to install the latest Ubuntu, but I also don't want to damage Chrome OS. Help! \n\nA: Updating Chrubuntu will not harm the ChromeOS\n(Updating the kernel from a Crouton based install will mess everything up)\nChrubuntu installs Ubuntu in a separate partition, much like a dual-boot setup that has Windows and Ubuntu in different partitions. So, updating Ubuntu won't do anything to the ChromeOS and vice versa.\nHowever, the Chrubuntu script tweaks the standard Ubuntu install to work with the Chromebook/Chromebox hardware. For example, touchpad of the Acer C720 Chromebook is not recognized in the default Ubuntu installation. The Chrubuntu script fixes that. A kernel update or an upgrade to 14.04 will change the Ubuntu kernel (but not the ChromeOS kernel in a different partition). This will undo the tweaks made by the Chrubuntu installation script. I don't know how this will affect Toshiba Chromebook 2.\nNote: This answer does not apply to Crouton based installation. Crouton uses the ChromeOS kernel, and is not a real Ubuntu installation. Any attempt to update the ChromeOS kernel with an Ubuntu kernel will probably break both the Crouton as well as the ChromeOS installations.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Tried Ubdating Kernel; Now, Desktop won't load on startup I get a blank black screen and a message that says \"could not apply the stored configuration for monitors required virtual size does not fit available size\" and says it can't use 3840xy and it's maximum is 1920.

So I switched to alternative players.\nVideo playing was fine, but I could not run some on-line games that needed newer Shockwave Flash. \nI also tried Chrome for these games, it started but got stuck in the middle.\nI did not removed Shockwave plugin, just disabled it and got it out of my mind,\n...until the middle of January, when Shockwave updater suddenly notified me about a new critical security update.\nSo I installed Pepperflash which gave me version 16.0 which is now updated to version 17.0, as recommended by Adobe Security Bulletin.  \nAbout week later with another update I looked at the Adobe Security Bulletin  again. Now it was recommending version 11.2 for Linux. \nMaybe they were so hurry to fix the critical problem that forgot about not updating Linux version, but then fixed it, I do not know. \nSince then everything working, including games.\nThe version 11.2 was not removed.\nNow I have 2 Shockwave plugins, and they keep updating.\nVersion 16.0 recently updated to 17.0.0.134, and another one to 11.2.202.451.\nI prepared a screenshot to post here, but I do not have enough reputation to post images.\nI disable version 11.2, but sometimes it get enabled by itself.  I suspect updates do it.\nOfficial Adobe page suggests version 11.2 for Linux, as before.\nMy questions are:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it safe to use?   \n\n*If yes, maybe it is good idea to copy recent Linux Shockwave flash from my computer and spread in the world? I need instructions how to do it for Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n*If it is not safe, what about using it just for some games sites? \n\n*Should I remove version 11.2?\n\n\nUPD1:\nI am sorry I did not explained it well. \nI have Firefox running on Ubuntu, and it has 2 plugins named Shockwave Flash:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Shockwave FlashShockwave Flash 17.0 r0   \n\n*Shockwave FlashShockwave Flash 11.2 r202.\n\n\nIt was copy/paste from FF add-ons page.\nUpd2:\nI did more research. Well, I was so wrong!\nThe file of \"Shockwave FlashShockwave Flash 17.0 r0\" is libfreshwrapper-pepperflash.so.\nSo I do have PepperFlash and Adobe Flash.  \n$ dpkg --get-selections | grep flash\nadobe-flash-properties-gtk          install\nadobe-flashplugin               install\nflashplugin-installer               deinstall\npepperflashplugin-nonfree           install\n\nThey probably updated at the same day,  so I thought both plugins are from Adobe.\nIt must be the PepperFlash that make the games to work.\nTo add more confusion, Firefox plugin page calls it \"Adobe Flash Player  Shockwave Flash 17.0 r0\".  \nThe only question that remains is:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Do I need both Shockwave Flashes?\n\n\nA: As far as I can tell, the latest version for Linux available at this moment is Version: 11.2.202.451 (I obtained this information from the about:plugins page in Firefox and verified at https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ ). \nIt's entirely feasible that the update recommendations are based on the erroneous assumption that everyone is running a copy of Windows (which IMHO has more security holes than swiss cheese). \nI'm running the version stated above and haven't had any issues. I do not recommend removing it. It doesn't appear as if Adobe feels the need to update the version available for Linux (although they are still providing security back-ports AFAIK)\nSince both plugins are listed in firefox it seems to be handling them fine seperately. I don't think you are losing anything by leaving them as is. Be that as it may, if you do decide to remove one of them and later discover that you need it it worst you'll have to do is reinstall firefox and a plugin or at best a plugin. As I recall flashplugin-installer is what's responsible for putting 11.2 on your system. I can't speak to your safety concerns as AFAIK either way your looking at closed source. You can choose to trust Adobe or Google, the choice is yours.

I wanted to ask\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to install Windows from DVD using grub commands\n\n*OR is there a way to wipe the hard drive in the current position\n\n*OR perphaps flash the BIOS to try and reorder the booting devices.\n\n\nI already tried removing the hard drive and I can then use a Live CD/DVD of any kind. But still don't know which and how.\nAny help is appreciated.\nHope to hear/read from you soon.\nBest Regards!\nTHE PROBLEM IS SOLVED in a rather stupid way. When I was trying to enter the multiboot menu I could only enter a menu where to choose between different versions of ubuntu. When I clicked Esc, I ended up in grub, where with the command exit I was eble to choose where to boot. I chose DVD and installed pure Windows. I hope this helps others with this kind of problem.\n\nA: Short answer:\nUse BIOS boot menu. If not available, then remove the hard drive and clean it in some other computer.\nDetailed answer:\nMost, if not all, BIOSes has something like boot menu. Such menu allows to arbitrarily choose boot device regardless of boot device order that is set in BIOS. To access the boot menu just tap the proper button during the early startup of your machine. Which one exactly - it depends on the BIOS. In mine laptop it is F12, in desktop PC it is F11. Your one can be different, but it is usually listed on the BIOS welcome screen.\nIf you can't access the BIOS boot menu as well, then remove the hard drive from your computer and mount it in another machine. You will be able to clean it and after that mount it back in the problematic computer. You don't need to clean whole disk, just the Master boot record. It can be done using Ubuntu DVD or Windows 8.1.\nCleaning the disk with Windows\nBoot the computer with Windows 8.1 DVD. When you see the first screen, when language options are available to choose, press Shift+F10 - you will see the command line terminal. Run the diskpart program by typing:\ndiskpart\n\nThe diskpart tool (very good and reliable, by the way) will start, and you can see the available disks by typping:\nlist disk\n\nThe list of all disk devices will be displayed. Determine which of the listed disk has to be clean (let's say that is is disk number 2) and select it by command:\nselect disk 2\n\nThen clean the disk:\nclean\n\nAnd exit diskpart:\nexit\n\nYou are done, disk is clean and can be mounted back in its original place.\nCleaning the disk with Ubuntu DVD\nBoot the Ubuntu live DVD and run the terminal. Let's say that your disk device is /dev/sdb, clean it by typing:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1M count=1\n\nBe extremely careful with dd command! That command does not ask of any confirmation and single typo can have disastrous effect, so double check before pressing Enter.\n\nA: If you can't really access the BIOS in any way, you can (always for IDE drives and almost always for SATA drives) force the boot priority by rearranging the drives connections to the motherboard:\nThis will only work if both your hard disk drive and your CD/DVD-ROM drive use an IDE or SATA interface.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the power cord from the power supply unit\n\n*Open the case\n\n*Rearrange the order of the devices on the motherboard according to the type of interface they use:\n\nSATA devices\nRearrange the connections so that the first SATA slot on the motherboard (usually named SATA1) is connected to the CD/DVD-ROM drive, and so that the second SATA slot on the motherboard (usually named SATA2) is connected to the hard disk drive\n\n\nIDE devices\n\n\n*\n\n*If the hard disk drive and the CD/DVD-ROM drive share the same cable: rearrange the jumpers on the back of each drive so that the CD/DVD-ROM is the Master device and so that the hard disk drive is the Slave device\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If the hard disk drive and the CD/DVD-ROM drive use a different cable: rearrange the cables so that the first IDE slot on the motherboard (usually named IDE1) is connected to the CD/DVD-ROM drive, and so that the second IDE slot on the motherboard (usually named IDE2) is connected to the hard disk drive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Reset the CMOS, using one of the following methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the appropriate jumper on the appropriate position on the motherboard (either refer to your motherboard's user guide or look for the jumper and its position yourself: see the picture below for a reference), plug the power cord back and start the system: your BIOS will state something along the lines of \"CMOS checksum incorrect\", asking you to choose wether to restore the default settings or to enter the setup: just shut down instead, unplug the power cord again and move the jumper back to its initial place; then restart again and choose to restore the default settings.\n\n*Remove the CMOS battery for about 1 minute (either refer to your motherboard's user guide or look for the battery yourself: see the picture), insert the battery back and start the system: your BIOS will state something along the lines of \"CMOS checksum incorrect\", asking you to choose wether to restore the default settings or to enter the setup: choose to restore the default settings.\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Landscape openstack juju management I have installed landscape openstack autopilot (Build OpenStack with conjure-up | Download | Ubuntu).\nCan somebody help me to understand how can I deploy services such as ceilometer?\nI download juju configuration, then copy it to .juju/enviroments.yaml.

This way, I can log in to ownCloud and edit my website files. I realize this isn't the most secure thing to do but I'm planning to put more security into it once I figure out how.\nI've read countless tutorials on how to install ownCloud so that's not my problem.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You can mount a directory on your server with the External storage support application (built in) via SFTP.

Also, this increases the security a little bit (emphasis: \"a little\").\nI assume you have set up your Apache/nginx properly and have defined your virtual hosts as well. For now the directory is in /var/www/website.\ncreate a system user for accessing the website's directory\nsudo adduser <username> #we'll call that user 'editor' for now\n\nset proper directory permissions\nsudo chown -R www-data:editor /var/www/website\n\ngrant writing permissions to group editor for that directory and subdirectories\nsudo find /var/www/website -type f -exec chmod 664 {} +; #for files\nsudo find /var/www/website -type d -exec chmod 775 {} +; #for directories\n\nIf you want to know the current directory permissions:\nstat -c %a /var/www/website\n\nSidenote: Take care about the writing permissions! 775 and 664 are not to be considered safe, you'll definitely need to know what you are doing here. The best option is not to set the permissions throughout the whole directory but set them for each subdirectory in particular.\nIf you do so, you should consider changing your SSH configuration to only allow SSH access via public key without password access. Also look at denyhosts, fail2ban, IPtables and all the great tools out there helping in hardening a server.\nGet back to your ownCloud Admin UI and configure an external storage via SFTP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Directory name: your choice\n\n*Type: SFTP obviously\n\n*Host: localhost\n\n*User: editor\n\n*Password: Swordfish (of course)\n\n*Root: /var/www/website \n\n*On the right: Only make that external storage available to your specific user.\n\n\nKeep in mind that SFTP access is pretty slow, but at least it gets stuff done.\n", "Q: Triple-Boot with GRUB on ubuntu I installed the ubuntu first, then windows.

You can try whitelisting the relevant IP too (see this question).\nConsidering you can SSH into them from home or from other servers, if you can't solve this, your best bet would be to use a third party (either your computer or one of those other servers) as an intermediary. rsync from your old server to your third server, then from your third server to your new server. Possibly you can also use SSH port-forwarding if you don't want to leave any data in the middle, though it will still pass through that third server.\n", "Q: I can't see my desktop only the terminal I'm completely new to this, I put in the cd and I get this terminal thing when I turn on my computer it asks for login and password I enter that, and then all it says is:\ntommy@tommy:~$\n\n\nA: I had this problem too.

So when both network interfaces are active, your system use eth0 to connect internet even if internet is inaccessible from eth0.\nOne solution is to edit the configuration on your desktop.  In the end, run sudo iptables -t nat -L in your desktop you should see something similar to\nChain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nMASQUERADE  all  --  10.0.3.0/24         !10.0.3.0/24\n\nwhere 10.0.3.0/24 should be the subnet connecting to your laptop.\nI would recommend another solution, which is to let Ubuntu prefer wlan0 than eth0.  One easy approach is using network-manager package, choose \"Edit Connection\", \n\nor run nm-connection-editor.  Then \"Add\" a new connection for ethernet, configure ip address, gateway, etc normally.\n\nThen click \"Routes...\" under \"IPv4 Settings\" page (and under \"IPv6 Settings\" page)\n\nClick the box saying \"Use this connection only for resources on its network\". \n\nFinally, choose the correct connection, my connection is named by \"USRP\".  Therefore Ubuntu knows limited resources is accessible via this Ethernet, so it would route all the internet traffic via WiFi. \nAll above is tested in Ubuntu 14.04 to 15.04 and gnome/unity desktop manager.  I think it should also work for LXDE. \n", "Q: How to Control FanSpeed on hp envy 15 my computer is prone to over-heating and so I'm trying to control the fan speeds.

The error messages about the failed mounting would at first not disappear. After a reboot the installation would continue after 5 minutes or so of error messages about the failed booting. \nThen the message about the CD which could not be found appeared. One way to solve this is just like you to manually create a link. Because I have 3 internal disks my USB was the sdd. By typing the following command in the kernel during setup it worked:\nmount -t auto /dev/sdd1 /cdrom\n\nThen after the installation would stop at the package manager for some reason. \nThe final solution was in the software used to make an image on the USB device.

The problem is that other sudo commands within that script don't necessarily inherit root permissions, but are executed as the controlling user. This can often produce the error you see from sudo, even if the parent script itself is allowed via sudo but the subcommands are not. \nWhat's happening is the nested sudo call within that script is failing because sudo would normally prompt for a password, but there's no controlling shell so it can't. This generates the slightly ambiguous sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified error that you see.\nAn easy way to illustrate this is if, like your example, an init script contains internal calls using sudo.  Running:\nsudo /etc/init.d/startvpn\n\ncan fail if your own user doesn't have sudo rights to all the sudo calls within, and might give you the sudo tty error. However, running it like this:\nsudo sh /etc/init.d/startvpn\n\nwould probably work. In the latter case, sudo sh creates a command shell as root, so anything that is run within that shell actually does execute as root. Root generally has unrestricted sudo permissions so it no longer matters if a command is run with sudo or not.\nSome things worth mentioning:\n\n\n*\n\n*As others have pointed out, most of this mess can be avoided by not using sudo within scripts. Often sub-commands that fail when run with sudo can work fine without it (when the parent script is run with sudo).\n\n*While running the script with sudo sh may solve the issue, again there are security implications to doing so. Consider that sudo behaves this way as a sanity check, to ensure that the contents of the script are not doing something they shouldn't, even if the script itself is allowed.\n\n*If the user you are running sudo as also has sufficient blanket permissions, you may not see any of these problems. But they can surface later, say if you develop a script with your own privileged account, and in production it's ran as a non-privileged service account. \n\n*In general you should avoid granting broad sudo permissions to user accounts as a way to solve this kind of issue. If really needed, limit the account access rules to that user and that specific command.\n\n\nA: I found the solution to the problem. \nI removed all of the individual sudo commands in my vpnon.sh script, and passed in sudo from outside of the script. \nIn my  /etc/init.d/vpnstartup file, I changed the su username -c to sudo $VPN_DIR/vpnon.sh\nwhich looks like this now:\ncase \"$1\" in\n    start)\n        sudo $VPN_DIR/vpnon.sh\n        ;;\n\nthen called sudo update-rc.d vpnstartup defaults\nand now the VPN connects on startup! :)\n", "Q: using ibus-table for latex I have ibus in my ubuntu 12.04 and I installed ibus-table for latex.

Since Ubuntu partition and the partition from where I will take the space are separated by Ubuntu swap, someone told me that it would be difficult because the partitions are not adjacent. Here is the position of the partitions:\n\nI want to take some space from sda5/D drive. My plan was going to Windows and shrink the D drive. And then, go back to Ubuntu using Gparted to enlarge my Ubuntu partition. But, some said that it is not that easy because sda 6/Ubuntu partition and sda 5 are not adjacent, there is sda7/swap in between.\nCan somebody give me appropriate steps to do the safe partition?\nUPDATE\nI've resized my partition. In the beginning, there was booting issue. The computer failed to boot, but by using boot repair, it can be solved. \nHowever, there is another problem. My swap cannot be activated. I have tried to activate it by using this way (which is not working, or perhaps I made a mistake in making the formulation):\n \n\n\nOne more thing, if I start my computer, this message comes up:\n\nThe disk drive for UUID=4517f43c-2509-4d76-bf3f-a802956e0c2f is not ready yet or not present.\n\nIf you see the picture above, there is no this kind of UUID in my drive.\nSo, can somebody help me with these two issues?\n\nA: This can be solved mostly with GParted from a LiveCD:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can temporarily disable the swap partition, which GParted should allow you to do through the partition context menu. Otherwise use sudo swapoff /dev/sda7.\n\n*Now you can delete the swap partition. This is safe, because (disabled) swap partitions hold no useful data.\n\n*Re-arrange and grow your partition(s) as you like, but leave some space for a new swap partition.\n\n*Create a new partition in the remaining unallocated space and format it as swap. Commit your changes.\n\n*Now you need to edit /etc/fstab to point to the newly created swap partition as described under https://askubuntu.com/a/166110/175814.\nAccording to your current configuration, you need to change the UUID in the first column of the last line to what you get from blkid for /dev/sda6 (I don't want to transcribe the whole UUID from that image):\nUUID=b42c...  none  swap  sw  0  0\n\nIt would be sensible to delete the second to last line (# swap was on…), because the statement in the comment is irrelevant now.\n\nA: It shouldn't be a problem;\nStart by shrinking D: from Windows, with disk checks & backups.. Then in gparted, move sda5 to the end (it probably won't be after the shrinking, then shift swap along to meet it, and enlarge sda6 to fill the gap. The partition numbers are however out of order; are you sure that's the order they're actually in? There will be an option to renumber them.\n", "Q: Aventail VPN tun0 dropping all packets I'm using Aventail 10.7.1.449 on Ubuntu 14.10 and cannot connect via VPN anywhere, because all packets after the first one are dropped:\ntun0      Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  \n          inet addr:<>  P-t-P:<>  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1452  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:1 errors:0 dropped:190 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:500 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:62 (62.0 B)\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: version 11.4.0.323 seems to have this issue resolved.\n", "Q: How to uninstall utorrent 3.3 in ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS?

My father owns a rather old (2006ish?) Compaq that had Windows 7 installed on it (x64) and has become so bloated, old, and impaired that it froze up every few seconds and ran slower than a snail. He is a bit strapped for cash and cannot afford a new computer, so I offered to install Ubuntu for him, since I have had good experiences with it in the past when my college laptop's version of Vista broke itself. However, I am unable to get any version of Ubuntu to work, and keep seeing the same error message.\nHere's what I've tried so far. When I checked the computer before trying an Ubuntu install, the Windows OS claimed to be 64 bit, so I first tried installing 64 bit versions of Ubuntu (and when that failed) Kubuntu. I first tried via a bootable USB I made following the instructions on the Ubuntu site. The version I tried to install was 14.04.02 LTS. The Ubuntu installation appeared to run and finish installing, but when I restarted the computer and booted it afterwards, it loaded the Ubuntu logo, then gave me this scrambled, gibberish looking glitched image pattern all over the screen and froze. The same thing happened when I tried to install Kubuntu afterwards. I thought perhaps the USB disk was bad, so I tried a few other USBs and different programs to create the bootable disk. The same thing happened each time.\nThis is the error message I keep getting:\n[ 0.125705] pup 00:04 can't evaluate _CRS: 12298\n[ 4.857500] ACPI: [Package] has zero elements {f47c4980}\nNext, I tried installing from an old CD I bought off ebay a few years back (Ubuntu 11.04 & Kubuntu 11.04) - Oddly enough, Kubuntu 11.04 is able to install and run, but cannot update, install programs, or add any software. Ubuntu hits the same error as the 14.04 version does when I tried the USB stick.\nNext, I tried going out and buying DVD-R CD's, and burned my own copies of Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and Lubuntu 14.04, in both x64 and i386, just in the off chance that my dad's old computer lied about being x64. The same thing happens each time I try an install, no matter which flavor I use, or whether i use 64 or 32 bit. When running the install, I get the aforementioned error messages in the terminal, the installation runs, completes, and asks for a reboot, and once I do, it loads just past the Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Lubuntu title screen, then freezes up with some jumbled image that looks like the graphics card had a seizure.\nI have no idea what is wrong, and no idea what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: graphics card seizure hahaha I want to see that :) \nHave a look in your bios settings, recently I've encountered  lot of errors regarding EDID and DVI when installing Lubuntu, which are to do with the screen, guess what the problem was? Not the screen or anything to do with graphics drivers- a setting in my BIOS regarding hard drive recognition was wrong. \nSo I'd suggest having a look at your bios settings- that has been the stumbling block for failed installations on two of my machines. \nI found some more possibly helpful info here;\nhttp://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=284419\nand here;\nhttp://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/acpi-error-and-kernel-panic-on-boot-fedora-12-a-780467/\nP.S.

I know that this question has posted few times before but I have a different problem than those one and those answers seem not to work on me. I have installed PyCharm Community 4 few weeks ago, and now I bought a student license (which is free of charge). I now want to install PyCharm Professional by deleting the Community version.\nProblem is I don't have a separate directory in which I extracted the PyCharm community. I somehow have managed to install it. When I wrote PyCharm in dash home, I am able to execute the program. But for the professional version, case is different.\nWhen I run the sudo ./pycharm.sh it doesn't install like it installed Community version. Every time I run pycharm.sh it asks me my license information, which is not permanent. And Professional PyCharm doesn't appear in dash home.\nHow can I permanently remove Community version and can install professional like I wanted?\n\nA: What version of Pycharm you are currently use and version that you want to install? Now let assume it as Pycharm.x.x.x:\nIf you installed it with apt, removed it first.\nsudo apt-get remove pycharm\n\nDelete you old configuration IDE which located at you home folder, you can use ls -s ~/ | grep pycharm to find it\nrm ~/.pycharm.x.x.x\n\nNow, if you want to install community edition using Ubuntu Make PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-make\numake ide pycharm\n\nTo remove PyCharm installed via umake:\numake -r ide pycharm\n\n\nA: delete the directory pycharm-community.x.x.x also the hidden directory .PyCharm from the home directory\n\nA: I found that this worked well:\nsudo apt-get purge pycharm-community\n\n", "Q: How much space is required for snapshots in ZFS? How much space do snapshots use in ZFS?\nI created a pool and want to create a volume. I don't know how much space snapshots will occupy. Is there any way or formula exist to compute space requirements for snapshots?\n\nA: The actual meta-data of snapshots are negligible.\nAs a copy-on-write file system, ZFS snapshots only require space for modified data; creating a snapshot does not immediately duplicate everything. If you have a snapshot of given size, and then add or modify files summing up to 100GB, the snapshot will \"cost\" you 100GB.\nIt might even be a little bit smaller because of compression and deduplication.\n\nA: A snapshot initially takes a very negligible amount of space.\nIts size grows later when existing data in the snapshotted dataset is updated or deleted.\nThe maximum size of a snapshot is the size of the original dataset unless compression and/or deduplication is enabled in which case you might have a snapshot smaller or larger than its parent dataset.  \n\nA: Prior to emperically testing this, I also believed what other answers said, namely that ZFS snapshots only consume disk space when blocks change, and snapshots taken where no blocks change at all consume no space (or only a very small amount of metadata for the snapshot name and an empty lst of changed blocks)\nTo my surprise when I tested this recently I discovered that the space usage was much larger than I expected: while still small, it was between 1.8 - 4 MiB per snapshot, which was significantly larger than I would have expected. (My guess would have been less than 1 KiB, so this result was over 4000x larger than I expected). See my Server Fault question for the details, but essentially I created a totally empty 200GiB zpool and was able to fill it up with 50,698 snapshots (and no data at all)\nWhat everyone else says is accurate: ZFS snapshots only store changed blocks and their space consumed depends on how many blocks change. But the minimum is not zero bytes, is's a handful of megabytes. (Where \"handful\" translates\" to \"somewhere between 1 and 10 depending on pool size and other factors\")\nWhether or not this amount is \"very negligible\" or not is an opinion question.\n", "Q: Scanner Not Found On Wireless Ubuntu 14.04 I was able to get the printer epson workforce wf-3520 to print wirelessly, but it can not find the scanner.

Chrome on Ubuntu decides it is to run in touch-screen mode.

There's an open issue for it here \nThe easiest workaround is to disable mouse integration in VirtualBox. It's somewhat inconvenient but a lot of people reported that this fixed the problem for them.

However, if you want to count each occurrence (so, count word foo word as 2 hits, not one), you can do:\ntail -1000 file | grep -o word | wc -l\n\nThe tail command prints the last 1000 lines, the grep -o word searches for word and prints each case found (so it will print it twice if it matches twice) and wc -l counts the number of lines returned. \nAlternatively, you could use something like perl to do the counting:\ntail -n 1000 file | perl -alne '$k+=grep{/word/} @F; END{print $k}'  \n\nFinally, note that this will also count things like wordsmith. To match only if your pattern forms an entire word, use grep with the -w flag:\ntail -1000 file | grep -wo word | wc -l\n\nor\ntail -n 1000 file | perl -alne '$k+=grep{/\\bword\\b/} @F; END{print $k}'\n\n\nA: Here is a general pattern:\ntail -1000 file.txt | grep -c \"word\"\n\nThis will print the number of lines that contain the pattern \"word\" in the last 1000 lines of the file named file.txt.

You could try the following method, it solved my problem as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*You must have run startx with root privileges. Doing sudo startx or sudo su; startx makes the root owner of a file called .Xauthority required for X session login by xauth\n\n*NEVER use sudo for opening graphical applications. root will create files which will be owned by it, which others can't access. Since in Ubuntu by default root will have no password set, this can severely mess with your settings and your not being able to access your configuration files. Next time use a gksudo instead.\n\n*Since your .Xauthority file is owned by root, there is no way you can log in. \n\n*Find another terminal, like log in to another account and open terminal, but don't log in to  guest account.\n\n*In case you have only one account which you can't log in, then finding a terminal is difficult since you can get one only if you can log in.\n\n*In that case find a terminal tty1 through tty7 by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1throughF7. This should provide you a terminal in case you have none at your disposal.\n\n*Enter the login credentials of your troubled account.

After that, you can issue:\nupower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0\n\n(change with your name). This will give you the full statistics of the battery.

If the battery is three-four years old, losing a 35% could be a normal thing.\nEDIT:\nGiven the new data on the question, this seems a bug of the power indicator; it is averaging the battery of your bluetooth and the main one.

I did a blog post on it, which you can read here.\nI'll also provide the basic instructions here.\n\nFirst off, you're going to need the CompizConfig Settings Manager software. If you don’t already have it installed, press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a Terminal.\nOnce that terminal is open, enter sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager and hit Enter. You’ll probably need to enter your password, but once you do it will install. Don’t close the terminal. \nOnce installed, go ahead and enter sudo ccsm. This will launch CompizConfig Settings Manager. It will show you a warning about the program being very powerful, probably say something along the lines of “With Great Power comes Great Responsibility”. Just click okay.\nOnce it comes up, search for workarounds and select the only option that comes up:\n\nThen, scroll down and select the Force full screen redraws (buffer swap) on repaint option:\n\nOnce you’ve done that, you can close Settings Manager, and you’re done!

I have a PHP application that can generate quite a lot of log information. I'd like to use logrotate to make sure these logs don't get out of hand over time.\nHowever, I'm concerned about race conditions. Could there be a loss of log messages if PHP is in the middle of writing to a log when logrotate determines it needs to rotate that log, as in the sequence of events below? If not, why?\n\n\n*\n\n*PHP opens log file for writing.\n\n*PHP writes a line.\n\n*logrotate decides the log file should be rotated.\n\n*PHP writes another line.\n\n*PHP closes file resource.\n\n\nWould using PHP's file_put_contents, for example, make any difference? What about, more generally, output that is piped to a log file?\nEnvironment Specifics:\nI'm using php5-fpm (Version: 5.5.9+dfsg-1ubuntu4.6) behind an nginx server on a different machine.\nMy proposed logrotate config (I haven't set anything up yet) would be something like this (in /etc/logrotate.d/my-app):\n/var/my-app-data/logs/*.log {\n    missingok\n    notifempty\n    weekly\n    size 20M\n    rotate 4\n}\n\nA couple of examples of my PHP logging code:\n$res = file_put_contents('/var/my-app-data/logs/general.log', date('[d/m/Y H:i:s]') .

' Starting process...' . \"\\n\");\n// ...\nfwrite($fp, date('[d/m/Y H:i:s]') . ' Something happened!' . \"\\n\");\n// ...\nfwrite($fp, date('[d/m/Y H:i:s]') . ' Something happened!' . \"\\n\");\n// ...\nfwrite($fp, date('[d/m/Y H:i:s]') . ' End of process.' . \"\\n\");\nfclose($fp);\n\n\nA: When an application opens a file, continue to write in it even if it is moved. Therefore, if you want to be sure not to lose information, you should send a signal to the application, so it releases resources.\nYou can try this configuration:\n /var/my-app-data/logs/general.log {\n           missingok\n           notifempty\n           size 20M\n           rotate 4\n           create mode owner group\n           sharedscripts\n           postrotate\n               nginx command to do graceful restart \n           endscript\n       }\n\nThis general.log file is rotated whenever it grows over 20M in size, after going  through 4 rotations, file are removed.\nThe sharedscripts means that the postrotate script will only be run once, not  once  for each log which is rotated.\nAccording to logrotate manual:\n          create mode owner group\n          Immediately after rotation (before the postrotate script is run)\n          the log file is created (with the same name as the log file just\n          rotated).   mode  specifies  the  mode for the log file in octal\n          (the same as chmod(2)), owner specifies the user name  who  will\n          own  the  log  file,  and group specifies the group the log file\n          will belong to.\n\nSo in your case:\n\n\n*\n\n*rotate file\n\n*remove general.log.5 if exists\n\n*create general.log with proper attribute and owneship\n\n*runs postrotate script\n\n\nYour application will continue to write general.log.1 until either closes the file or postscript is executed and nginx perform a graceful restart.\nIf your application always close log file via fclose($fp) or uses file_put_contents you should omit nginx graceful restart.\n", "Q: Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM warning: You have loaded library [...].so which might have disabled stack guard \n\nJava HotSpot(TM) Server VM warning:\nYou have loaded library /tmp/libnetty-transport-native-epoll7650900490225298142.so\n which might have disabled stack guard.\nThe VM will try to fix the stack guard now.\nIt's highly recommended that you fix the library with \n'execstack -c <libfile>', or link it with '-z noexecstack'.`\n\nThis shows up on startup of my Minecraft server\nUbuntu 14.04LTS 32bit java1.8.0_40\n\nI tried uninstalling java completely.\nAnd reinstalling.\n'execstack' is not a command in terminal or java\nIs there a fix for this?\n\nA: Just attempted to correct this issue on my server.\nDid the following:   \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install prelink\n\nthen ran the execstack command only to be told the file doesn't exist\nManually checked the /tmp directory and the file does not exist so it wasn't a path error.\nHow a file can be loaded that doesn't exist is a puzzle unless it was loaded during a java update and then erased....\n", "Q: Can't access my hard drive with my windows files I'm running Ubuntu 12.4 from a flash drive so that I can recover my windows files because my laptop is experiencing boot loop.

I also want to use this USB as live CD to install Ubuntu on any computer.\nHow Can I install Ubuntu 14.04 on my external USB Pen-Drive?\n\nA: Even if you do decide to follow these instructions, I suggest you read the LiveUsbPendrivePersistent wiki page. Reading Wiki pages is a great way to learn and you'll know more about what you're doing - rather than just following steps blindly.\nNormally, I'd suggest that you use the Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu to do this - it has a really simple option:\n\n\nthat allows you to add MB of space to keep stored in reserved extra space. However, there is sometimes a bug with installing the bootloader:\n\nat least for me. You also mentioned that you'd had issues with Startup Disk Creator created USB drives being so.\nSo, I'd suggest you use Unetbootin. It's not quite as polished, but it does the exact same job and has the exact same store in reserve functionality. It's what I use when creating LiveUSBs and has yet to fail me. \nIt's in the default repositories, so you can install it via sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install unetbootin.\nOnce it's installed, open up the dash (Super key - aka Windows key) and open up unetbootin - you'll have to search for it. It'll require the sudo password, just a heads up. You'd need sudo access just to install the app, so that's no problem.\n\nOnce unetbootin starts, you'll want to change the radio button from selecting Distribution (default choice) to selecting Diskimage and then click the ... button. You can then select the ISO and it will show up in the text box.\nOnce you've selected the ISO you want, make sure the type is set to USB drive and that it's targeting the correct USB drive. If you've got USB backup media or other USB sticks attached to your computer, you may want to consider disconnecting them for a bit - just to be safe and sure you don't accidentally overwrite some important data.\nNow, to add the persistence of data, simply change the Space used to preserve files across reboots (Ubuntu only) value. This should create a file-system on the USB stick, along with the ISO contents, that will store your information across reboots!\n\nNote, that if you use Unetbootin to create the LiveUSB, you'll have to specify the space in MB (MegaBytes) not GB (Gigabytes). A simple way to convert this is just punch into a calculator numberOfGigabytes * 1024. That will provide you with the correct amount of space in MB terms (as there are 1024 MB in a GB.)\n", "Q: Booting Into Fresh Install of Ubuntu on Lenovo x120e Finished installing Ubuntu, in what appears to be a successful installation. However, I cannot boot into it (\"No Operating System Found\"). After researching, I came across this article that advises the following steps:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*set BIOS to allow non-EFI boot\n  \n*boot to Live CD\n  \n*make directiry /mnt/1 , mount installed partition to /mnt/1\n  \n*mount --bind /dev /mnt/1/dev ,same to /proc, /sys\n  \n*chroot /mnt/1\n  \n*aptitude update; aptitude purge grub-efi ; aptitude install grub-pc\n  \n\nWas able to create the /mnt/1/ directory, but not familiar with the \"mounting procedures\" described in steps 3,4,5,6.

Then, installed the latest Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS - Trusty Tahr over it. This remedied the boot issue and am now able to boot into Ubuntu on my X120e.\n", "Q: Why does apt-get upgrade give ELF file warning? Executing sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade:\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\ngives the following message, which I think is a warning:\n\n/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/lib/libf2c.so is not an ELF file - it has the wrong magic bytes at the start.\n\nWhere is the origin of that and how can I fix it?

Thank you in advance.\nPD This question is similar to that asked here but it has no solution yet :/\nEDIT: I just found a similar question that was indeed answered:\nSo is this a bug and I can do nothing??!\n\nA: You might have a corrupted file, so try removing and reinstalling the libf2c2 and libf2c2-dev packages:\nsudo apt-get purge libf2c2-dev\nsudo apt-get purge libf2c2\nsudo apt-get install libf2c2\nsudo apt-get install libf2c2-dev\n\nThe question you refer to has another problem, their file is a python script, so of course it is not an ELF file.  \n\nFixed the package names. \n", "Q: Enforce port number for ssh-copy-id EDIT \nI solved this by using ssh-copy-id \"user@host -p 4444\"\n\nFor some reason my remote machine tries to connect to port 22 on my box, so I use commands such as scp -v -oPORT=4444 nickeleres.tar.gz root@nickeleres.com:~ wherein I specify the port number of my nginx config.

But I want to run windows in Ubuntu instead of switching between them all the time. So I am now trying to install windows 8.1 (using the same windows disc and product key) in Ubuntu with virtualbox. While installing, I am given the options of \"upgrade: will move all files, settings, applications to windows directory\" or \"custom: install windows only, will NOT move files, settings, applications to windows directory\".\nWhich one should I choose?\nDoes the first option \"upgrade\" means it will copy the settings and installed applications of the windows I have been using to the new windows in virtualbox, so that I need not, e.g., install MS office again? That sounds great if true.\n\nA: You should choose the second, \"custom\" option.\nBy default, your virtual machine doesn't have access to real partitions on your hard drive. You probably can change this in your VM's options, but I'm not sure that it will work as expected (because I've never tried to do it :)).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10: Error while reading from descriptor - broken pipe Every time when i start my laptop i'll get this error message \nError while reading from descriptor - broken pipe\n\nI don't know what to do.

I just plugged a second ubuntu box into the router, but it gets an 84.210... address. I can ssh to it from the others, but not to any of them from it. What's going on?\n\nA: It seems like your second Ubuntu box has received an external IP address for some (uncertain to me) reasons. And in this case it's not surprising that ssh to your other PCs doesn't work - without port forwarding set up on the router it can't reach the machines which are in the local subnet.\nUnfortunately, some important details are missing, especially this: did it work previously in the same configuration?\n\n\n*\n\n*If no, try to plug your \"second box\" into another port on your router and then reboot the box.\n\n*If yes: first try to reboot the router and the \"second box\"; if this doesn't help, try to remember any changes that were made since the last time it worked.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Insatlling CUDA : Failed to add GPGKEY at http://cuda-repo/repos/GPGKEY to apt keys I have a brand new installed Ubuntu 14.04, my laptop has an NVIDIA GEFORCE 740M. I've been following this guide to install CUDA, and right after tyiping: \nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_6.5-14_amd64.deb \n\nI get an error message \nFailed to add GPGKEY at http://cuda-repo/repos/GPGKEY to apt keys.\n\nI tried what suggested here with no success, and I'm definetely lost right now. How do I fix this problem ?\nI tried the same process with the new CUDA 7 and that gave me no errors but some driver problems arose, I'm trying to install CUDA 6.5 because me and a collegue are wroking on the same project and he already has the 6.5 working so I need to adapt (even though I don't think having another version of CUDA can cause any problem). I'd like to solve the GPGKEY problem, but if that's not the case I'll have to do it another way (in this case any hint would be much appreciated).\nKeep in mind I tried to install CUDA 6.5 with the .run, there I had no problems but when installing the nvidia-cuda-toolkit it only installed the 5.5 version clearly not compatible with the 6.5. So again, I'm open to any other possibility to make it work. It feels like even if I fix this problem, I'd still have issues getting the nvidia-toolkit 6.5. If you need any other information to help me out, I'll be glad to share it.\n\nA: Long story short: The DEB file currently linked on the CUDA Toolkit 6.5 page is broken and after fixing becomes equivalent with the 7.0 one.\nMore precisely, it seems somebody at Nvidia mixed up the file from production testing (containing but an internal network alias) with the one meant for release, which would have pointed to the actual public server.\nTo see that, fully extract it and run grep -R http, you'll get but references to http://cuda-repo.\nYou could fix the file (the linked 6.5-14 will update to the equally broken 6.5-19, so let's go with that) with…\nmkdir tmp && cd tmp\ncurl -O http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1404/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_6.5-19_amd64.deb\nar p cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_6.5-19_amd64.deb data.tar.gz | tar zx\nar p cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_6.5-19_amd64.deb control.tar.gz | tar zx\nsed -i -e 's/cuda-repo\\/prodtest/developer.download.nvidia.com\\/compute\\/cuda\\/repos/g' etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda.list\nsed -i -e 's/cuda-repo/developer.download.nvidia.com\\/compute\\/cuda/g' postinst\ntar czf data.tar.gz etc usr\ntar czf control.tar.gz conffiles control postinst postrm\nar rv cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_6.5-19_amd64.deb data.tar.gz control.tar.gz\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_6.5-19_amd64.deb\n\n… but once you use it, you'll find that apt-get install cuda will just try to get the 7.0 one, and that if you (I) had just tried the DEB for 7.0 to begin with, might have noticed that the package has been renamed to cuda-6-5 anyway. Thank you, Nvidia!\n\nA: To install nVidia cuda, follow the instaructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*first download the .run file from here. (you can check for the latest version available here)\n\n*Place the downloaded file in your home folder (/home/username/)\n\n*now change the tty session with Ctrl+Alt+F1 (before doing this, note down the instructions somewhere else. we are going turn off the GUI session)\n\n*Login with your username and password\n\n*run this command to turn off the x-server:\n\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\n\n\n*Run the cuda installer with this command:\n\n\n\nsudo ./cuda_*\n\n\n\n*Follow the instructions of the installer and install cuda development toolkit.\n\n*When done, run this command to start xserver again:\n\nsudo service lightdm start\n\n\n\n*Finally get back to GUI (tty7) by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7\n\n*Please perform a restart and enjoy!\n\n\nYou can skip steps 8, 9, 10 and enter this command to restart directly after installation:\n\nsudo reboot\n\nI did the exact same process and I successfully installed cuda development toolkit.

The main problem is that if the ssh daemon config is failing how is the server supposed to know that it is failing? In theory you can write a script that replaces the faulty config with a correct backup version but this is only useful if the server can detect the configuration is failing, For example if the ssh daemon crashes then the process is gone which can be sign it is time to put the backup in place.However you can make adjustments that negatively affect ssh connectivity while the daemon still remains active. This is something you can't detect and therefore the backup will not be copied.\n\nA: SSH is started using Upstart, and uses Upstart's respawn option to restart it when the process dies. Therefore you can try detecting when the SSH job has hit the respawn limit, and overwrite the configuration with a known-good one. For example:\n# cat /etc/init/ssh-safe.conf\nstart on stopped ssh RESULT=\"failed\" PROCESS=\"respawn\"\nscript\n  cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config.original /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n  start ssh RESTARTED_BY_WATCHDOG=1 || true\nend-script\n\n", "Q: Driver support for Lenovo X1 Carbon (3rd Gen) in Ubuntu I am a big fan of Ubuntu and I use it with Gnome in my Dell Latitude E7440.

OpenSSH in recent versions have moved to use ECDSA by default over RSA, and this works fine with most implementations that rely on OpenSSH's \"known hosts\" file.\nDolphin's kio_sftp module uses libssh instead of OpenSSH's own libraries, and that library appears to not support ECDSA keys. The workaround is detailed in the KDE bug report - remove the existing key, and either force OpenSSH to cache the RSA host key (an example command line is detailed in the bug report and below), or just use Dolphin to connect directly.\nBecause the KDE bug is resolved, but we still see the bug in Kubuntu 15.04, I've opened a bug on the Kubuntu KDE implementation.\nSample command to reset the host key:\nssh-keygen -f \"$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts\" -R server\nssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa user@server\n\n", "Q: Google chrome opens specific website when ran from launcher I'm having a problem with my Google Chrome.\nWhen I open it from launcher (I mean bar on the left side) it starts with youtube website, and it starts to play some video.

I have a small Dell 1012 Mini (Intel Atom), running 14.04 (installed on an SSD). My music and other media is stored on an external HDD (encrypted LUKS), and my media is found and indexed (stored in a database) without problems (well I have to restart the dlna server because the disk is not unlocked and available before the dnla server starts, when I boot the notebook).\nDuring playback, things generally work fine, except now and again, say every 15 to 30 mins during an mp3 playback (different songs, it doesn't matter what I play) on my ipdio internet radio, the music pauses for about 4 secs before carrying on. The wireless connection is not lost, and the internet radio doesn't complain. The pause happens, and then music play continues.\nI used to use an iomega NAS drive for my media, and that was 99.9% reliable. It did also pause very occasionally, maybe once every 30 hours of playback (also using the same ipdio radio playback client). So I think the difference here is now the notebook is the server, and I have a USB encrypted HDD for my media. The iomega NAS drive was standalone, and not encrytped\nThe Dell mini 1012 with the SSD is reasonably quick, but I'm still getting a pause. I'm sure the Dell has more CPU power than the iomega home media network drive.\nI'm thinking, something must be interrupting the stream to the client, but what? I'm sure the internet connection to the client is fine (its wireless), as I can hear internet radio with zero problems. And because both miniDLNA and Mediatomb have the same symptoms, then it is likely to be perhaps the system accessing the media HDD (which is symlinked to my directories in my home directory).\nI've looked at syslog, and see nothing, I've looked at both the logs for miniDLNA and mediatomb, and they do not log any problems\nWhat else could I look at in terms of logs? Might usb access logs help?\nWhat could be causing the random pause of approx 4 secs?\nIs access to a USB encrypted external drive a low priority?\nEven if access to a USB external drive is a low priority, I would of expected not so low that a 4 second pause is heard.\nBasically, how can I go about fixing my audio pause problem, so that I can listen to music without have a random sudden pause for a few seconds?\nUpdate\nI unistalled mediatomb, and went back to minidlna. Because I feel I had more pauses with minidlna than mediatomb. But I have no statistics to back that up. My plan being, if the problem occurs more, I have a better chance of capturing it in a log file.\nI also copy some mp3 albums onto the SSD of the notebook, and setup minidlna to only access the albums on the SSD (so the encrypted symlinked HDD music collection is not being accessed). I'm hoping then this will isolate where the problem area is. Is it the DNLA server and connection to the client, or is it the USB access to the encrypted drive? Well it didn't take long to answer that question. Tom Jones was suddenly paused for a few seconds during playback! So access to the USB encrypted HDD doesn't seem to be a problem.\nThe problem seems to be in the server to the client. The problem could be in the client, but while it worked 99.9% of the time with a NAS drive setup, then its likely not the issue. I'm using the same WLAN router too.

I have a Yamaha R-N500 network receiver hardwired to an ethernet router (Linksys). It currently communicates with the web for such things as net radio and Pandora. Is there a straightforward means to link my Linux-based PC, also on the same router, to the audio receiver? I want the receiver to be able to access and play music files (ex: mp3) off the PC. The receiver has a 'server' option as one of the input selections. I can also read all the data assignments at the receiver as far as addressing is concerned. The big mystery is how to actually implement the media sharing between the two devices.  \n\nA: Getting some search on internet i could find that this model is DLNA capable and Airplay(Apple) capable. So you must install some app to stream your media over your network. Some examples:\nKodi media center (aka XBMC)\nMedia Tomb\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18.04LTS install Rygel (sudo apt install rygel) and add folders, any folders in the standard Settings menu under Sharing.\n\nNo need to fiddle this is standard in Ubuntu 18 and up using the standard Settings GUI.\nYou can add sftp, dav, davs, ssh, dropbox, google drive, smb, sftps, nfs and even AppleTalk afp:// shares. \nThen if you need to share internet radio stations over DLNA this is possible too. \nTo stream SomaFM over DLNA (Rygel) to your DLNA client (Yamaha receiver or any other player) you need to edit rygel.conf. Not just any rygel.conf but the one in /home/$Username$/.config/rygel.conf. (Where $Username$ is your username.)\nGo to the section [GstLaunch] and edit the changes as seen below.\nI have added the complete section of a working version of rygel.conf here.\n[GstLaunch]\nenabled=true\nlaunch-items=audiotestsrc;soma;drone\n\naudiotestsrc-title=Audiotestsrc\naudiotestsrc-mime=audio/x-wav\naudiotestsrc-launch=audiotestsrc ! wavenc\n\nsoma-title=SomaFM SpaceStation soma-mime=audio/mp4\nsoma-launch=souphttpsrc iradio-mode=false location=http://ice2.somafm.com/spacestation-128-aac\n\ndrone-title=SomaFM Dronezone drone-mime=audio/mpeg\ndrone-launch=souphttpsrc iradio-mode=false location=http://ice2.somafm.com/dronezone-256-mp3\n\nNo need to change anything on the Yamaha, just turn on and press the server button. Or go to server if no button has been assigned (YET:) Both Rygel and the Yamaha are DLNA compatible.\n\nA: Ubuntu 19.10’s new ‘Media Sharing’ toggle in Settings > Sharing means you can share media photos, videos and music over your local network. It all works using the ubiquitous DLNA/UPnP protocols and your local network — no third-party cloud server or media centre set-up required. (Source: OMG Ubuntu).\n\n\n*\n\n*To activate media sharing in Ubuntu 19.10 just pop open the main Settings app and select the ‘Sharing’ option in the sidebar:\n\n\n*Click on the ‘Media Sharing’ option that’s greyed out in the main pane. A small modal dialogue will appear:\n\n\n*Slide the switcher in the header bar of the modal dialogue to ‘On’, and then select a network from the list to share your media on.\nDisclaimer: DLNA sharing isn’t a secure way to share media. Everyone on the same network can access (but not edit/delete) shared media.\n\n*You’ll notice that 3 folders are shared by default: Pictures, Videos and Music. If you don’t want to share one/any of these just remove them from the list using the x ion to the right of the folder name.\n\n*To add your own media sources just scroll down the dialogue and hit the + button. Then use the folder picker to navigate to and select a different folder on your system. Repeat the process to add additional directories. \nFor more details, please read the article on OMG Ubuntu.\nIt looks like it is based on Rygel and this tool is now integrated in Ubuntu. Be careful it sometimes autostarts by default/mistake after upgrading to 19.10 but a fix is on its way (Nov 2019).

So I'm rebuilding my storage server. For stability, I want to use Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS as the OS. However, I'm planning to use Btrfs with RAID 5, and this has been greatly improved in kernel 3.19. So I want to use that kernel with 14.04.\nI know that 3.19 is the kernel that will be used in 15.04, and is scheduled to be released in August as a HWE kernel and the default for 14.04.3. But I need to build this server now.\nI don't want to get into funky custom set-ups that will break things in future. So what is the most trouble free way I can use that kernel now on top of a 14.04.2 installation, that can be easily reverted to standard in August, when I can dist-upgrade to 14.04.3 and get the kernel I want as standard?\n\nA: The easiest way to upgrade kernel to 3.19 in Ubuntu 14.04 is to run:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\nThis will install meta package, that will pull everything else. Image and headers will be installed.\nThis method is good, because 3.19 kernel will get security updates and bug fixes through routine update & upgrade process.\nOld kernels 3.13 or 3.16 will not be removed. They will be bootable using grub menu. And they will get updates too.\nIf you do not want 3.13 or 3.16 kernel to be updated, you can remove meta packages:\nlinux-image-generic linux-headers-generic for 3.13\nlinux-image-generic-lts-utopic linux-headers-generic-lts-utopic for 3.16\n\nA: You can install a newer kernel\n\n\n*\n\n*as described in Kernel/MainlineBuilds or\n\n*in this case more simply with the packages built from linux-lts-vivid from the trusty-updates repository:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\nThis meta-package always depends on the most recent version of Canonical's v3.19 kernel branch.\nThe equivalent for the v4.4 kernel branch of Ubuntu Xenial is linux-generic-lts-xenial (what a surprise).\nSince kernel packages of different branches don't replace each other, there is virtually no danger, that either of the above steps will make your system unbootable¹. If the newly installed kernel doesn't run, you can select to boot different/previous kernels in the GRUB menu during boot.\n¹ The most notable exception is a broken GRUB configuration. If update-grub (called by the kernel package post-installation and post-removal scripts) doesn't work without the new kernel, it won't work with the new kernel either.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n\n*Enter the most recent v3.19 directory (today it is v3.19.2-vivid)\n\n*Download 3 files:\nlinux-headers-3.19.X-ZZZZZZ_3.19.X-ZZZZZZ.YYYYMMDDHHMM_all.deb\nlinux-headers-3.19.X-ZZZZZZ-generic_3.19.X-ZZZZZZ.YYYYMMDDHHMM_ARCH.deb\nlinux-image-3.19.X-ZZZZZZ-generic_3.19.X-ZZZZZZ.YYYYMMDDHHMM_ARCH.deb\n\nBe careful, one of the linux-headers is common to all architectures (_all.deb). The other linux-headers and the linux-image must match your machine's architecture (_i386.deb or _amd64.deb).\n\n*From the terminal, install all of them by running:\nsudo dpkg -i linux-{image,headers}-3.19.*.deb\n\nOr just use the TAB auto-completion to help you typing the full file names.\n\nA: You can now install the \"latest\" (3.19) Ubuntu kernel directly from the repositories:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-vivid linux-headers-generic-lts-vivid\n\nThis will install stable Ubuntu kernel for Vivid. And the headers that are needed for building several modules on your system.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Dual Booting Ubuntu Alongside Windows 8.1 So I had Windows 7 and tried to dual boot and ended up writing over my Windows 7 bootloader, but I really wanna try to dual boot with Ubuntu. I now have Windows 8.1 and want to try dual booting with Ubuntu again. Is there anyone that could walk me through this? I don't wanna mess up again.\nEdit: So i read up on wubi, it does not work on windows 8. I can install using it, but i cannot then reboot into, it doesnt do grub right or something.\n\nA: I regularly dual-boot.  Typically after installing Windows OS you have to rebuild the grub bootloader.\nI install an Ubuntu Live CD and fire that up in Repair mode.  You will see an option there to repair grub.  Ubuntu does its thing and afterwards you get a menu to pick the OS you want to boot into.\n\nA: This works. In the grub, there should be a system setup, open that and choose the windows boot manager. That will open windows.\n", "Q: How can I run ubuntu running of a live USB and get it to keep all my data and not be really slow How can I get Ubuntu to run off a USB drive but on shutdown it keeps all my data intact.\n\nA: If you already have Ubuntu installed on your pc, you can use the Startup Disk Creator that is already preinstalled. It has the option to store documents and settings in a reserved space, of which you can define the size. It won't be as fast as a normal install when using USB2 (I'm not sure about USB3), but it will be fast enough once Ubuntu has been loaded into your RAM, for me at least.\n", "Q: RecordMyDesktop video and sound off? so with RecordMyDesktop for some odd reason it is fast forwarding the video and slowing the sound the two are not matching up at all. so can some one tell me how to fix it or what to use to fix the speed of the video?   \n\nA: According to this discussion this might be due to your computer being too slow.

How do I \"rebuild\" or \"repair\" aptd?\nI don't mean up the various utilities to rebuild and reconfigure which has not solved my problem suggesting that something more fundamental is damaged. I am looking for a totally fresh and clean replace/rebuild with all old cache etc cleaned out as not knowing what I need to fix I am hoping this more aggressive approach will simply wash away the fault.\nIf aptd came on a disk as int he old days I would uninstall and reinstall at this stage. As it is (as far as I know) the process for doing that I don't know what to do.\nBackground\nThe problem I am trying to solve with this question may have been triggered during the upgrade process itself.\nA huge apt log file from failed upgrade - what went wrong & how do I fix it?\nI figured out how to shut down aptd and apt-get and get my CPU back but this does not address the underlying problem that aptd is actually damaged. I think if I can do this that the problem will be addressed.\nHelp: “aptd” is maxing out my CPU?\nI should point out that the most complicated thing I compiled and ran a make file for was no more complex than \"hello world\". I may need baby steps.\n\nA: The answer (that I needed) appeared to be that maybe aptd was fine but the /boot area was a bit too full - fixing this was the \"repair\" that was needed. I discovered this quite by accident while browsing related questions (and their related questions).\nHowever what I originally thought was that APTD was corrupted and needed to be purged and rebuilt. It's a whole other debate as to if this is even an answer to the wider question that I asked.\nWhat I did\nRemoved the old config files which, according to an answer here (My /boot partition hit 100% and now I can't upgrade. Can't remove old kernels to make room) is safe to do.\nI also tried sudo dpkg -r linux-image-2.* which just seemed to be recursive and broken in some way that was beyond me. Killed it with control+C.\nSwitched to synaptic package manager and uninstalled a few older kernels. Then tried to get the out of date packages to update. It has been awhile since apt-get has been able to do anything so I felt this was something that needed to be done ASAP.\nThis had the effect of locking up synaptic and I had to terminate it it with killall -9.\nThen a comment on my question about this (Is it safe to remove old vmlinuz.* files from /boot) led me to How do I remove old kernel versions to clean up the boot menu? and this command:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge $(dpkg -l 'linux-image-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d')\n\nThis cleaned up just shy of 3MB of disk space.\nI then ran sudo apt-get upgrade which started the upgrade of 1260 packages. Needing about a Gig of archives.\nThen I waited.\nThe next day I came back to it to see that it was waiting for me to respond to a prompt regarding gnome config. I chose the default option.\nThat completed successfully. I then did a clean, update and clean (because I am a newbi) and did sudo apt-get upgrade again and installed 3 more upgrades.\nTL;DR: I think I needed to remove old kernels... that seemed to work.\n", "Q: Bash History is not Working I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 Server Edition.

You're running in NTLM compatibility mode and any shared resource only gets its ACL checked whenever you're trying to access it...\nOnce accessed, it gets cached in an internal Windows shadow account and revoked only when you reboot the Windows system (for sure) or do a netstat -R (not sure, this has been a while) \nNow, the best way to circumvent this \"feature\" is to create the same user ID/password pairs on the Ubuntu box as on the Windows machines and then you'll never see this again!\n", "Q: Why kernel are updated regularly, even more frequent than os releases I have been observing that Linux kernels are updated regularly. What I believe is that the kernel provides a basic layer for the OS to interact with different hardware and software. It is open source and in earlier days it seemed logical for kernel to evolve fast. But now, all the kernels are pretty good, still we are seeing continuously kernel updates. If we look at OS X, the base system is not updated very often, even both have comparable stability and functionality.\n\nA: You observation of more regular kernel updates is partly the fault of the kernel being one giant blob of stuff that needs to work very well with the (in Ubuntu case, apt) package system (or your system will be unbootable!)\nWhile various software bugs and security flaws serious enough to push an update are only affecting those with the respective software installed, everyone using GNU/Linux will have the Linux kernel installed. So while various apps get various updates - everyone gets the kernel updates. Consequently, each individual gets many kernel updates but only few other software updates in comparison - simply because his system has only specific software installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a terrible flaw in some RAID driver that will occasionally\nrender important data unreadable? Ubuntu must ship an update, for anyone\npotentially affected = everyone using a kernel version including the\nfault = probably everyone using a supported version of Ubuntu.\n\n*A terrible flaw in the MP4 module of the nginx web server is discovered,\npotentially allowing a third party to take over a streaming server? Most Ubuntu \nusers do not get an update, even most who are using nginx are not getting, because\nthey do not have that specific module installed, and only the package containing \nthat module need to receive a security update.\n\n*A terrible flaw in Windows is discovered, making user applications using the\nWindows System certificate store accept malicious certificates and consequently \ndisclose some of their meant-to-be encrypted traffic. Since patchday was last week, \napplication vendors will work around the bug until next month. A single kernel \nupdate is shipped for all collected updates then, also creating some illusion of \nfewer updates.\n\n*A terrible flaw in a user application on Windows is discovered.\nSince Windows does not have a package manager, nobody notices. The user reinstalls his machine months later, when realizing he was part of a large botnet.\nRule of thumb: If you don’t need feature updates, use the Long-Term-Support (LTS) updates. All updates shipped to those version are, to some extent, important bug and/or security fixes.\n\nAnother note on the frequency of updates on Linux distribution in general and Ubuntu specifically: The way Microsoft and apple deploy updates is, from a security standpoint terrible. It's not that they do better software and need fewer updates, it's that they deploy updates from an economic standpoint, which means they usually don’t, even though some users (but not a economically relevant share) is affected by bad bugs.\nOn Linux, you see security flaws fixed within hours of being known. On some proprietary systems, maintaining companies ask security engineers to withhold information about flaws from the public for 3 months (e.g. Microsoft) and only responsibly release those until a fix is released in the usual cycle, e.g once monthly (e.g. Microsoft).\nThink about the implications of security flaws getting fixed in a well-planned, but SLOW way versus the way Linux does it: best-effort as fast as possible. You'll understand why many admins prefer the open-source and Linux approach, despite increased update frequency and all potential problems such comes with.\nTL;DR: Fast an frequent updates are a good thing, as long as their installation is undisruptive and seldom causing fails in automatic mode.\n\nNote: Kernel updates will become less of a hassle in the future. Architecture for handling installation and removal of older versions via apt is being improved right now, also various Linux distributions are eyeing and/or exploring methods of deploying smaller fixes as live-patches that can be applied to a more-or-less \"running\" system without you needing to care a lot about it.\n\nA: This might also be why it seems so much more stable. Remember every windows or mac update there are a lot of complaints about everything breaking. If there are minor bugs with the changes and there are less of them at once it results in less stuff breaking. \nImagine if all of the fixes came at once and each had issues from untested use cases, and maybe even some of them are made worse by other unrelated changes.Updates sometimes break stuff for me however they generally feel minor and are seem easier to fix when I am on a linux distro like arch which updates a lot.\n", "Q: failed to download package sources I am trying to download package sources for all the installed packages in 14.04.2 release version.

And that really should be configurable.\nSadly, “modern” display managers seem to often not care about /etc/X11 much anymore, and re-invent the wheel… badly.\nProbably because it is rather hard to find out why things are the way they are. (I tried. I still don’t know why there are so many files/scripts and what all their purposes are.)\nE.g. SDDM doesn’t use .xsession-errors at all, and logs to some other strange location, if at all.\n\nAddendum\nThe second question should really be separate.\nDue to me still not knowing all about it, I can’t help with that.\nBut I think I can say that you probably shouldn’t create another custom session file.\nMaybe the LightDM documentation helps you there…\nAbout the third question: The man page for xinit and its associated man pages (from the same software package) explain this. There’s a list of alternatives, some in $HOME, some in /etc, some even in /usr/share/… sub-directories. But I think if there is none, some default is assumed too.\nSorry, this should probably be separate too. I only post what I do know.\n", "Q: Detect interface promiscuous mode in my network How can I detect and get the name or MAC address or IP address of any device in my network where the mode of its interface is promiscuous using a Python script.\n\nA: Pretty unclear question.\nYou can see if a PC is in promiscuous mode on a LAN, go here: How to find out that a NIC is in promiscuous mode on a LAN?\nIf you're trying to get in promiscuous mode using python on Linux try this:  Python Sockets: Enabling Promiscuous Mode in Linux\nOther than that if you're trying to find an IP/MAC address, PC name, etc. through a LAN even if a user is in promiscuous mode, then I'd have to look more into it, otherwise trying asking or looking around on Stack Overflow.\n", "Q: How do I count text lines? How do I count how many lines are in text file.\ne.g :\ncommand file.txt\n\nNote, I want to only count the non-empty lines (lines without counting white space and tabs)?.\n\nA: Using grep:\ngrep -vc '^$' file  # or\ngrep -vc '^\\s*$' file    \n\n\nA: You can use:\ngrep -cve '^\\s*$' file.txt\n\nIf you need a command for that, just paste the following lines into your .bashrc and restart your shell session or open a new terminal:\ncount_lines()\n{\n    grep -cve '^\\s*$' $1\n}\n\nExample:\ncount_lines file.txt\n42\n\n\nA: With awk:\nawk 'NF{++count} END{print count}' file\n\nExplanation:\nThe NF indicates the total number of fields, and hence this prints only non-blank lines, since in non-blank lines NF is greater than 0 and evaluates to true. So increment the count flag when awk found a non-blank lines and print the latest value of count flag at the end by END{print count}.\n\nA: Try sed:\nsed '/^$/d' file.txt | wc -l\n\nIf you have any lines containing only spaces or tabs and if you want to ignore them as well from count:\nsed '/^[[:blank:]]*$/d' file.txt | wc -l\n\n\nA: The above answer are correct but slightly different, you can use the grep to for easier code such grep -vc '^$' file.txt\nFor example(A):file.txt\n$grep -vc '^$' file.txt\n\n1    First line         #This is two tabs to comment.\n2    \n4\n3    Fourth line        #Another two tabs to comment.\n\n$2\n\nFor example(B):file.txt\n$sed '/^$/d' file.txt | wc -l\n\n1    First line         #This is two tabs to comment.\n2    \n4\n3    Fourth line        #Another two tabs to comment.\n\n$4\n\nNotice the result is 4! when we want to expect only two. but this counts the tabs in between the content and comment as well.\nNotice the counts from 0 and counts from 1 its different from the grep to the sed as I remember for more details search for grep or sed.\n\nA: Edit: you can just add the c option to grep instead of piping everything to wc, see @muru's answer for a more compact version\n\nWith grep:\ngrep -v '^$' file.txt | wc -l\n\n\nA: Perl solution\nPerl can do that. In general counting lines works as so:\n$ perl -ne 'END{print $.}' input.txt                                                                                     \n\nIf we want to exclude all empty lines, we'll do something like this:\n$ perl -ne '$c+=1 if not /^$|^\\s+$/;END{print $c}' input.txt                                                             \n\nLet's say we have input file like this\n$ cat -n input.txt\n     1  Cat; Dog; Squirrel\n     2  ORGANISM Animalus terrus\n     3  \n     4  Sequence: ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT\n     5  \n\nThere's 5 lines total, 2 empty lines. The command we have would output:\n$ perl -ne '$c+=1 if not /^$|^\\s+$/;END{print $c}' input.txt                                                             \n3\n\n\nMulti-file improvement\nThis works well for a single file. If we want to have it working on multiple files, we can do something like this:\n$ perl -ne '$c+=1 if not /^$|^\\s+$/;printf(\"%d %s\\n\",$c,$ARGV) and $c=0 if eof' input.txt /etc/passwd                    \n3 input.txt\n52 /etc/passwd\n\n", "Q: Can I use Java to develop gui for ubuntu I'm developing a GUI for Ubuntu using Quickly tool.

However, recently (I don't know what caused the change) when editing files in VIM it will sometimes insert a 001B character in a square box when pressing a \"wrong\" button.\nE.g.:\nWhen at the beginning of a line and I press h to move left, it will print one of those OO1B characters in a box over the leftmost character. \nOr, when at the top of a file, and I press k, it will print such a character again. \nOr when pressing . to repeat something without having a command to repeat, it will print such a character.\nEach time it prints the character at the current cursor position. I have no idea what causes this.\nMy terminal profile uses:\n\n\n*\n\n*Source Code Pro, Medium - font (but it also happens with system fixed width font)\n\n*Terminal character encoding is set to UTF-8 (But it also happens with other encodings)\n\n\nIt seems like it prints both a 001B in a square box, and a 'g' at the same cursor position. But it doens't actually 'write' it in the buffer. They are just shown on the screen and remain there until for example I change the character at that cursor position in the buffer. In which case it now shows the correct character again.\n\nAnybody have any idea what might be causing this? I'm at a loss.\nI use the solarized colorscheme, but it runs together with CSApprox because that's the only way I got the colors working almost completely (background for dark background is still off, but everything else is fine).\nThat's why my .vimrc has the following:\nset t_Co=256  \" To make CSApprox not nag\nlet g:solarized_termcolors=16  \"so that solarized uses my terminal presets which I've configured to the solarized colors.\n\nI use syntastic for highlighting syntax errors.\n\nA: I have found the reason those escape appear by disabling everything in my .vimrc file and reenabling incrementally. For those people with the same problem, it is caused by the following setting in the .vimrc file:\nset visualbell \"Use a visual error indicator instead of a beep\n\nRemoving the above line fixed the problem.\nSilly and logical, but well...

Do I need to install kernel source to apply the patch?\n\nA: The short answer is: Yes. \nThe long answer is, that you will need to compile your own kernel. So after installing your sources from repo, you need to patch them. This is the point, where to use the patch command from above. I think here you can find a good start as documentation how to do it on your Ubuntu system.\n\nA: You have a 3.16 kernel. Why do you have to install kernel source? The patch is to augment the _local errors you get when you compile  \n     ./build/utest/utest_run\n\nwhich would be fixed in Linux kernel 4.2. Since you are using an older kernel, the patch will fix the 15-30 errors you get when you compile \n             ./utest_run.\n\nOne thing you have to do that the documentation did not mention is to log on to root (sudo su) before you apply the patch. If you take a look at the first line of that patch, you would see that the patch goes through the /drivers directory in your root folder.\nDo this, apply command parser if you have to, and run ./utest_run all over again.\nBe sure to report your output here to help others in the future.\nGoodluck!\n", "Q: Which openstack version will be installed with juju?

Then it reads the input file, and uses its line number to look up what output file number to write each line to.\n\nA: Another simply awk solution is :)\nawk -F, 'NR==FNR{ X[NR]=$0; next } {print X[$1] RS X[$2]>\"out\"FNR}' file lines\n\nExplanation:\nNR==FNR    - Execute next block for 1st file only (*file*)\nX[NR]=$0   - Create an associative array with key as 'NR' (line number) and copy\n             whole line ($0) into it as its content.\nnext       - Jump to reading the next row from *file* (1st file)\n\nprint X[$1] RS X[$2]   \n           - Print those line from array X that its line-number is the same as \n             value of first field in *lines* file then print a new-line(RS) and \n             print the line that its line-number is the same as value of second \n             field in *lines* file again and redirect the result into out#\n\n\nA: Another bash solution, assuming input as the input, pattern as the pattern and output as the output:\n#!/bin/bash\ni=0 # set the output number to 0\nwhile read row; do # for each line in file `pattern` as $row\n    columns=$(<<< $row tr ',' '\\n') # store each line obtained by transforming ',' in '\\n' inside $row in an array $columns\n    for column in $columns; do # for each member in array $columns as $column\n        sed -n \"${column}p\" input\n    done > output$i # write column $column in `input` to `output$i`\n    ((i++)) # increment the output number\ndone < pattern\n\n\nA: The python script below will do the job as well:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n#--- set the paths below\nf1 = \"/path/to/predifined_rows.txt\"; f2 = \"/path/to/outtakes.txt\"; save_to = \"directory/to/save/the/outtakes\"\n#---\n\nrows = [l.strip() for l in open(f1).readlines()]\nouttakes = [eval(l.strip()) for l in open(f2).readlines()]\nfor i in range(len(outtakes)):\n    s = (\"\\n\").join([rows[n-1] for n in outtakes[i]])\n    with open(save_to+\"/\"+str(i+1), \"wt\") as out:\n           out.write(s)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy it into an empty file, save it as outtake.py\n\n*In the headsection, set the path(s) to f1, f2 and the directory to save the files to\n\n*Run it with the command\npython3 /path/to/outtake.py\n\nWhat it does\n\n\n*\n\n*it reads the numbers from the second file, reading the lines as a list of numbers\n\n*for each of the rows, it collects the corresponding items of the first file (by index) and writes it out, to separately numbered files, in the directory defined in save_to\n\nA: You can use the tool split. A bunch of examples can be found e.g. here\nHowever, in your case something like \nsplit -l 2 <inputfile>\n\nwill create a set of files with two lines called something like xaa, xab ... \n", "Q: Horizontal video tearing I am using Xubuntu 14.10 on Dell Vostro 5470 (GPU is Intel HD 4400).\nI have serious problems with watching videos (no matter if on Youtube or on local storage), video keeps tearing when there are fast movements etc.\nI installed Intel graphics installer, changed output in VLC to XCB, but nothing changed. \nPlease help!\n\nA: To be more precise,It is just small marginal tearing during high motion video correct? If so, I recently had this problem on Ubuntu and fixed it via compiz settings (setting v sync to blank and undirecting full screen windows). It is to my understanding that Xubuntu uses its own compositing/window manager so I wouldn't be awfully much help, but if you try playing around with that it may work. I found this video as a great reference tool for how much tearing was going on: btw I have the same intel HD 4400 GPU, I think this is the root of the problem haha.

The standard recovery image does not permit adb access, so you need to supply one to ubuntu-device-flash which will allow adb to work. This image is a good choice:\nhttp://people.canonical.com/~jhm/barajas/recovery.img\nYou can then type\nubuntu-device-flash touch --bootstrap --channel ubuntu-touch/stable/bq-aquaris.en --recovery-image recovery.img\n\nWhich will reset your phone (including a data wipe!) to factory state.\n\nA: Try recovery with wipe/data factory reset option during boot before flashing device from image.

I want to use Chrome or Chromium on Ubuntu 12.04. I have installed Adobe Flash plugin from the Ubuntu Software Center, but it only works for Firefox, not for Chrome or Chromium web browser. \nI have also tried to install by .tar ball. placed .so file in chromium browser installation directory and usr folder in /usr, but all in vain. \nIs there any other solution or am I missing something? My Ubuntu Software Center is not able to locate Pepper flash plugin. \n\nA: Pepper Flash Player is built-in with Google Chrome web browser, so it doesn't need to be installed separately. Google Chrome can play flash videos without installing any other software. Pepper Flash Player is not built-in with Chromium web browser, so it must be installed separately. Pepper Flash Player in Chromium is the same as the built-in flash player that Google Chrome uses.\nTo install Pepper Flash Player for Chromium in Ubuntu 12.04, open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:skunk/pepper-flash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pepflashplugin-installer  \n\nIn order to configure Chromium to use Pepper Flash Player, open /etc/chromium-browser/default from the terminal in nano text editor using the command sudo nano /etc/chromium-browser/default and add the following line to the end of the file on a new line:\n. /usr/lib/pepflashplugin-installer/pepflashplayer.sh    \n\nPress the keyboard combination Ctrl+O and after that press Enter to save the file being edited.

We are planning to migrate from an older version of Ubuntu to (10.x) to the latest release of Amazon Linux. I'm trying to identify how to replicate the K and S scripts in the rc0.d, rc1.d etc directories.\nMy question is, how to determine which is the default level? \nThere is no /etc/inittab, and the man page says it's been replaced by files in /etc/init. But they rcx.d directories contains references to specific apps within our system, while the /etc/init contains a bunch of .conf files. I'm thinking this somehow points to the rcx.d directories, perhaps via the rc.conf, rcS.conf or rc-sysinit.conf but can't lock down the actual startup level.\n\nA: Ubuntu has replaced the traditional SysV init with Upstart. To somewhat stay compatible with SysV or runlevel based init, Upstart still supports the SysV traditions.\nYou can find (and change) the default runlevel in the /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf file. The following command will do:\n$ grep \"env DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL\" /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf \nenv DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL=2\n\nAs you can see the default runlevel is 2, you can also change it to your desired runlevel.\n", "Q: Audacity playback speed much too fast, on Ubuntu Mate 15.04 I just had a major issue with Audacity, on the first Ubuntu Maté distro. I was doing some sound work, and recording directly from microphones and audio monitors; but when I attempted to play back the sound, it was consistently done at an extremely high pace. Further experiments uncovered that even generated sound, like tweets, was playing back maybe 10x too fast—I could see it on the time bar.\nSince I didn't really have time to mess around with it, I tried just uninstalling it, deleting all config files, and installing it from scratch. It works now, at least for the time being (thankfully!), but does anyone know what could have caused this?

I'm wondering why does sudo actually NEED the password, when the user has already logged in?\nThe fact that the user has managed to run sudo means that the user has passed authentication and is authorized to do that. \nSo why does sudo need to ask for authentication again?\nNOTE: I'm not actually trying to disable the password; just asking from curiosity.\n\nA: sudo asks for your password by default.  It is not recommended, but you may bypass passwords for users/groups for all, or limited commands, if you chose to do so.\nHere is why sudo asks for a password by default:\nLinux is a multi-user system, and the easiest way to see this is to look at the root user, vs your own user.  Major system-critical components are protected by being accessible by only root.  This is why people suggest you create an alternate user than root when doing daily tasks.  Imagine the following command run as both users (root and you):\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get purge ubuntu-desktop    #DO NOT RUN THIS\nIf you're cruising around as root, you've just removed ubuntu-desktop;  If you're logged in as a normal user, you'll get an error.\nNow, imagine how many different programs you run, and how connected to the internet they all are.  Each of these clients/internet-connectable programs that you run are attack vectors or ways for people to gain entry into your machine.\nLet's say that there is a new exploit for your favourite browser firefox that allows the attacker to gain shell.  Would you rather the user have YOUR shell, or your ROOT shell?\nThis is why sudo asks you for your password.\n\nA: The user you are logged in as does not have all of the abilities necessary to perform all commands, this is to protect the system from accidental or intentional damage.  Normally root and your username will have different passwords and only the system administrator will know the root password.  It is a little different on a 1 user system where your username and root's password tend to be the same.  So while it may been like you already have been authorized this is not the full picture...\n\nA: Your account is member of the wheel/sudo group which allows you to perform super user commands, but it's not an \"administrative\" account like root. \nIt is possible to use your root account to log on, removing the need to sudo. However, that practice is discouraged since it would expose the system to serious threats. \n", "Q: Using iproute2 in /etc/network/interfaces When you're adding a static route to /etc/network/interfaces, how can you use iproute2 commands instead of net-tools commands? For instance, I added the following line:\npost-up ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 dev eth0\n\nto my interfaces file and rebooted, but didn't seen the effect in the new routing table.\nIs my syntax wrong or am I forced to used net-tools in 14.04-LTS? I know /etc/rc.local is one solution, but I'd rather keep networking stuff all in one place.\n\nA: Use either pre-up (before the interface comes up), up (after the interface comes up), down (before the interface comes down) or post-down (after the interface comes down) followed by the command you want to run. In your case, you'll likely want to use up and down.\nHere's a block that I use for assigning an IPv6 address to my internal network:\niface eth0 inet static\n        address 192.168.0.1\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        broadcast 192.168.0.255\n        up ip -6 addr add 2001:DB8::/64 dev eth0\n        down ip -6 addr del 2001:DB8::/64 dev eth0\n\n\nA: I suppose before that line is a iface eth0 inet <static|manual|dhcp>\npost-up should run the command only  after the interface comes up, to do so there is no need to reboot, just ifup eth0.\nTo better understand the problem post your interfaces file.\n\nA: This is a complete PDF about route in Linux.

I have installed TexLive2014 under scheme-full using the latest iso file. But terminal still doesn't recognise the 'tex' or 'latex' commands. Do I need to install extra packages outside of the iso file? If so, why are they not included in the iso file?\n\nA: You have two possibilities here: \n\n\n*\n\n*install the version released with your Ubuntu. For example, 14.04 ships with TeXLive 2013 (not 2014). This is the easiest way; just type \nsudo apt-get texlive-full \n\nand be done. \n\n*You can install directly the newest version of TeXLive. Follow for example the instruction in https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1092/how-to-install-vanilla-texlive-on-debian-or-ubuntu/95373#95373. Be warned that installing software outside the package management can led to some complex situation; in that post you have some hint. \n\n*There are instruction also in Upgrade from Tex Live from 2013 to 2014 on Ubuntu 14.04 \nThe option #1 is the recommended one, unless you really need some cutting edge version of the packages (I am for example a quite advanced LaTeX user, and rarely do). \nThat said, it seems that the only problem you have is that the installation path is not in your PATH. It is explained in \"finishing the installation\" in the first linked post, or in point #5 of the second one(1). If you find that part too complex, I really advise to follow option #1. \n\n(1) they are different methods/philosophies, but they have the same final effect. \n\nA: You should install it from the official Ubuntu sources.\nsudo apt-get install texlive\n\n", "Q: How to configure netbeans 8.0.2 for C++ in ubuntu 14.04?

It containes only a number with level of KB backlight.\nThis failes:\nedison23@edison23-N56VM:/sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/leds/asus::kbd_backlight$ sudo echo 3 > brightness \nbash: brightness: Permission denied\n\nThis succeeds\nroot@edison23-N56VM:/sys/devices/platform/asus-nb-wmi/leds/asus::kbd_backlight# echo 3 > brightness \n\nWhy?\nThanks\n\nA: \nIs it bad to have at all times (one) terminal logged in as root? If so, why?\n\nYes. Well. The idea of logging out your root terminal is due to the fact that Linux is a multi-user system. So other users could walk to your terminal and issue commands you do not want them to issue. With the introduction of desktops (that are often single user) this is less of an issue.\nThe 2nd issue is that some files depend on the user being the owner of files. If you touch those as root they will be saved for the user root and you can lock yourself out of the desktop.  We have several questions about that on Ask Ubuntu.\nBut besides that: Ubuntu does not use root. We use \"sudo\" and (by default) you have to supply the \"sudo\" password every 15 minutes. So there is no need for \"root\". No need at all. Learn to live with the way Ubuntu does it. It has proven it works over the past decade or so. \nBut... It is your system. It is your data. If you believe you need \"root\" go for it. Most of us will not. When you mess up it is  on your head (but that is also doable using \"sudo\" ;) ). \nMake regular backups. Check that you can restore backups. And you should always be able to restore your system.\n\nA: \nIs it bad to have at all times (one) terminal logged in as root? If so, why?\n\nI can only say that I worked the same way as you, until I made a huge mistake... most of the time I forgot to add sudo in front of my commands to get the privilege for systemuser. \nThen on one day I executed as root the command\nrm -rf / var/www/filenotneeded.html\n\n... as you may see there is a space after the / which means it deletes / and all subfolders until rm itself is removed.\nIf I had used sudo maybe I had checked it twice because I still forget sudo today. Since I use sudo the error rate was getting down and and I feel a bit more secure then before. I dont say you will do the same error... I just want to warn that with root you destroy the system in microseconds and sudo tells me that I should check the command before I execute it.\n", "Q: ncmpcpp stops highlighting current song Hi I'm recently working around with ncmpcpp and I've configured it pretty nicely to what I want.

I have the latest Ubuntu version and I am a total beginner.\n\nA: Just temporarily go to terminal to install synaptic package manager\nMy understanding is that it is the precursor to software centre and is basically less glitchy\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\nonce that's installed, open it and go to software centre > right click > reinstall or whatever it says\nalso try reinstalling skype through there - it should tell you (unlike software centre), what other bits of software are neccessary for skype to run smoothly\non that note can't you just install the binary for linux here?\n", "Q: Is there a 3dmark for ubuntu I don't want this to test my gpu I would only like one to have on my big monitor playing and I don't know if I can get 3dmark for ubuntu\n\nA: 3dmark test DirectX performance. Ubuntu / Linux uses OpenGL. So simply: No there is no 3dmark for Ubuntu.\nMaybe this helps you to test your system:\nIs there a benchmark tool for Ubuntu?\nWhat I recommend you to test the systems 3D performance cross platform is the Unigine Heaven Benchmark:\nhttps://unigine.com/products/heaven/download/\nThis Benchmark is free and uses OpenGL and is available for Linux, Mac and Windows.\n\nA: There is no current version of 3DMark for Linux, even though they DO have OpenGL benchmarks (Ice Storm (which has an Android version) and a downgraded version of Cloud Gate called Slingshot). Both are quite light and are not that great for testing PC gaming hardware (I get ~300 fps on a gaming notebook from 2011 when running Ice Storm on Windows).\nThey currently do not have any plans to create a linux version, but they are watching SteamOS carefully and may release Linux versions if SteamOS becomes very popular.\nLike Flatron said, for now just use the Unigine Benchmarks like Heaven and Valley.\nSource:\nhttp://community.futuremark.com/forum/showthread.php?181979-3DMark-for-Linux (Source #4 is a futuremark employee)\n", "Q: Runescape application using wine I downloaded runescape mmorpg and play it using wine. it continuously shuts down on me.

It comes with a Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4 wireless network adapter. I have not been successful getting this wifi to work. I have tried some suggestions for Yogas but they, apparently use a different adapter. I have also tried ndiswrapper without any luck. I downloaded a windows driver which installed fine and indicated that it found matching hardware, but still no wifi.\nIf I cannot get it working soon, I'll have to send the machine back. Life without Ubuntu is not to be considered. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I was able to get my Qualcomm Atheros 61x4 running on a ubuntu 15.04 clean install. Actually not for the Lenovo model but for an Acer Aspire VN7 Nitro 791G These are the steps I accomplished:\n\n\n*\n\n*install kernel sources: apt-get install linux-headers-(uname -r)\n\n*downloaded the athk master sources from kvalo: git clone https://github.com/kvalo/ath.git\n\n*downloaded the backports tree: \"git clone\ngit://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/backports/backports.git\"\n\n*built the new backport tree according to the instructions found on linux-wireless: https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/ath10k/backports\n\n*downloaded the firmware from sumdog and copied it to /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/ : \n\n\n(Sorry I am not allowed to post more than two links) \n\"wget github.com/sumdog/ath10k-firmware/raw/5faf5bb7c7413f9bbde54cca6fff58e/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/board.bin\" \nand \n\"wget github.com/sumdog/ath10k-firmware/raw/5faf5bb7c7413f9bbde54cca6fff58e/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/firmware-4.bin\"\n\n\n*\n\n*created athk10 config file as described in this post before:\nsudo echo \"options ath10k_core skip_otp=y\" > /etc/modprobe.d/ath10k.conf\n\n*copied firmware-4.bin to firmware-5.bin as dmesg claimed about not finding firmware-5.bin\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: EDIT:\nThe Intel 3160NGW card is the one to get for the Yoga 3 11 and Yoga 3 14. I did the replacement and can confirm it works. If you do this, make sure you get a card with FCC ID PD93160NGU, other IDs will not be recognized by the BIOS.\nOriginal post:\nI've got a Yoga 3 11, which has the same Atheros card (QCA61x4). I've been tracking the driver issue closely, and it looks bleak. There is some movement for a QCA6174 driver, but I'm sort of sure it won't work for the QCA61x4 (different PCI listings -- 003e for 6174, 0041 for 61x4). I can imagine eventually we'll have linux kernel support, but it will be a while.\nI like the computer a lot, so I'm keeping it. In the meantime, I'm using USB wifi, and I ordered a replacement intel wifi card (3160NGW). The yoga has a picky BIOS, and the 3160 is the one to get for our model based on reading Lenovo's published compliance documents. If you decide to replace the wifi card, make sure you get one with a matching FCC ID. For the 14 model, I would verify that the wifi also uses the M.2 connection.

I would like the 'window' to occupy the upper half of the desktop, and show the 20 most recent lines.\nI use the line ${execi 3 tail -n20 ~/myfile.txt} in my conky script file but the results get truncated when conky displays them on the desktop.  I have measured this to exactly 256 bytes (including spaces).\nSo I get 2 or 3 lines worth of contents only instead of 20.

This buffer is used for intermediary text, such as individual lines, output from $exec vars, and various other variables. Increasing the size of this buffer can drastically reduce Conky's performance, but will allow for more text display per variable.

However, it's rather ugly...\nI followed the instructions here for getting started, and one of the points was adding the exec --no-startup-id gnome-settings-daemon line to the ~/.i3/config file that was supposed to make everything look good again. However, after re-logging, nothing seems to have changed.\nNow, I'm guessing that those instructions were intended for use with an Ubuntu install that uses GNOME as the default DE and I use Unity. \nI also looked at this question, which points to installing lxappearance for this issue in Awesome Window Manager. However, I again doubt this would apply to my case, since I use Unity & it's i3 I'm dealing with.\nDoes anyone know what I need to do to \"de-uglify\" i3? I really like it, and I'll probably continue using it even if I don't have the nice GTK themes, but obviously it would be nicer to have things looking pretty again.\n\nA: lxapperance will do what you want for i3.\nYou also want QT, GTK 2.0, and GTK+ to look the same as your chosen theme.\nInstall:\n\n\n*\n\n*lxappearance\n\n*gtk-chtheme\n\n*qt4-qtconfig\n\n\nThese applications allow you to configure the theme, QT, and GTK to have the same appearance. (They are good if you don't feel comfortable getting into GTK engines or editing a bunch of config files, and they run independent of Gnome!)\nsudo apt-get install lxappearance gtk-chtheme qt4-qtconfig\n\nStart with lxappearance and choose a theme; then choose it in gtk-chtheme. In qt4-config, there is a dropdown menu setting to make qt take the GTK+ settings. That seems to work best for me. (It makes VLC and KeepassX look good.)\nAs for applets, the Network Manager applet is the most important one. In your i3 config file, add this line to the end:\nexec --no-startup-id nm-applet\n\nIn your web searching, when you find other applets you'd want to start, you do it exactly the same way:\nexec --no-startup-id <applet name>\n\nWhen you logout and log back in, the Network Manager applet should appear on the lower right.\n\nA: All of the suggestions that I am giving represent only my opinion and one may or may not agree with them.\n\n\n*\n\n*One of the best tutorials, on ricing (de-uglifying) your i3 can be found in this youtube video\n\n*Further, you should also install i3-gaps, its absolutely beautiful.\n\n*You should also checkout the reddit /r/unixporn for amazing ideas for ricing your i3.\n\n\nA: I was trying to solve the same issue and found a direct solution to what was being asked about here, namely the i3 window borders.\nFrom a blog post @ http://hndr.me/blog/making-my-new-linux-less-ugly/\nclient.focused          #3F8AC2 #096BAA #00BAA7 #00DA8E\nclient.focused_inactive #333333 #5F676A #ffffff #484e50\nclient.unfocused        #333333 #424242 #888888 #292d2e \nclient.urgent           #C10004 #900000 #ffffff #900000\n\nAre lines to append to ~/.config/i3/config that control the foreground and background colors of i3's window titlebars.\nChange the font with \"font\" (it's likely already there). It's recommended to use pango for better font renderings. For example, I use the following:\n\nfont pango: Dejavu Sans Mono 14\n\nwhile the linked blog uses\n\nfont pango: Ubuntu Mono 10\n\nAdditionally you could add another 'font' line within the 'bar {} '\nblock to use a different font in the status bar. For example of what that may look like:\n\nbar {\n    status_command i3status\n    position top\n    font pango: sans 12\n\n     colors{\n           background #232323\n           statusline #DCDCDC\n    }\n\n}\n\n\nA: You can also take help from config files that Manjaro uses for i3. They are highly customized and you can learn a lot from them.\nI found the dot files here: https://github.com/Airblader/dotfiles-manjaro\nPS: I do not own this repo.\n\nA: I really like this simple, dark solarized configuration: https://github.com/tobiaszwaszak/i3wm It looks good and has no special dependencies.\nCopy the main config file to ~/.config/i3/config and the i3status.conf to ~/.config/i3/config (to be clear, you want to rename the .conf file to config, not create a subfolder under i3status). MOD+Shitft+R reloads i3 and you should see things look much better instantly.\nNote that this config uses Alt for the MOD key and does other non-default things you may want to customize.\n", "Q: What does linux-headers-`uname -r` do? What does the following command do?\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nsudo executes the statement with elevated priviledges. apt-get is a command to retrieve a specific package/program. What does the rest of the switches/flags do? \nI'm trying to reset my wireless adapter's drivers to \"factory default\" settings.\n\nA: --reinstall install:\nNormally, this is written install --reinstall, but both work just fine. This simply is telling apt-get to reinstall the package(s).\nlinux-headers-:\nlinux-headers- is the beginning of a package name. If you run dpkg -l | grep linux-headers- you can see a full list of any packages installed that begin with that:\n\nHeader files are, from the GNU site:\n\nA header file is a file containing C declarations and macro\n  definitions to be shared between several source files. You request the\n  use of a header file in your program by including it, with the C\n  preprocessing directive ‘#include’.\n\nAnd, as you can see from the response from dpkg -l | grep linux-headers-, the packages that start with linux-headers- are the header files for the Linux kernel.\n`uname -r`:\nThis is what is known as Command Substitution. (The link is to the faqs.org page about the BASH command substitution capabilities.)\nThis runs the uname -r command, which returns the current kernel version:\n\nand then puts what is returned from the uname -r command into the sudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-headers-`uname -r` command. \nFrom the faqs.org page:\n\nCommand substitution allows the output of a command to replace the\n  command itself. Command substitution occurs when a command is enclosed\n  as follows:\n$(command)\n\nor\n`command`\n\nBash performs the expansion by executing command and replacing the\n  command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any\n  trailing newlines deleted.\n\nAlso, see this Unix/Linux Q/A about understand BASH backticks.\nNow, you don't see this happen - you just see the results. However, if you did see the command after the uname -r response was put into the command, this is somewhat it would look like (changing for your current kernel version obviously):\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-headers-3.16.0-31-generic\n\nSimplified version:\nYou're telling apt-get to reinstall the linux-headers package for your current kernel version.\n", "Q: Automatic wake from suspend when power restored to laptop I'm using a Chromebook with Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS installed as an embedded system of sorts.  I've figured out how to have it automatically suspend when disconnected from power by adjusting the power manager settings.\nBut I would like to find a way to have it automatically wake when power is restored.\nIf it isn't possible to detect that event and wake up, I also have a powered FTDI USB serial interface connected that could generate an event to wake on, but it doesn't appear in the list of /proc/acpi/wakeup devices.\nNote that when I run upower -d, I see things that could be potential triggers.  For example, device /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/line_power_AC has a line-power/online field (set to yes when plugged in).  Device /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 has an on-battery field (set to no when plugged in).\nI'm open to switching to a scenario where I automatically shutdown when the battery is low, if it's possible to configure the computer to automatically turn on when power is restored.  I've seen it do that on occasion, but not reliably.\nIf it matters, I'm using a John Lewis ROM which boots Ubuntu through GRUB.\n\nA: After further research, I found that I could get the desired behavior with my setup.\nI went into the Power Settings and configured battery power as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Suspend when inactive for: Don't suspend\n\n*When power is critically low: Power off\n\n*When the lid is closed: Do nothing\n\n\nLikewise, when plugged in it's set to not suspend when inactive or the lid is closed.\nTo test, I unplugged the Chromebook and waited for the battery to get critically low and power off (overnight).  When I reconnected power the next day, it automatically booted and all was good.\nMy previous tests had failed because I was shutting the system down manually, instead of having Ubuntu do it.\nI was unable to find a solution using suspend and wake.  It could potentially work with additional USB hardware with an ability to send a keyboard event to wake the Chromebook up when power is connected.\n\nA: I'm making several assumptions here, since I don't know exactly what hardware you're using. Generally speaking, there is an option in a computer's BIOS called Power Loss Restart or AC Power Loss Restart (see here for a little more info). If that function is not enabled, try enabling it.\n", "Q: Muon Discover toolbar has disappeared I am running Kubuntu 14.04.2, and have Muon Discover as my package manager.

The option can take  up  to\n               three  numerical values, or the `force' flag followed by a DPMS state.  The `force' flags forces\n               the server to immediately switch to the DPMS state specified.  The DPMS  state  can  be  one  of\n               `standby',  `suspend', `off', or `on'.  When numerical values are given, they set the inactivity\n               period (in units of seconds) before the three modes are activated.  The first value given is for\n               the  `standby'  mode, the second is for the `suspend' mode, and the third is for the `off' mode.\n               Setting these values implicitly enables the DPMS features.

However when you're running it using ./myfile.jar you're asking the shell to determine the interrupter to run it with, which it's unable to do. \nThe shell looks for the shebang line at the beginning to the script to known which application to run the script with, which is why you'll see shell scripts starting with:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nOr python scripts start with\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nWhat you're telling the shell, basically, is to run the script using the application you find at /bin/bash or /usr/bin/python. In the case of your jar file, the shell is unable to find the shebang so it doesn't know how to execute the code.\nIn the past I've used wrapper scripts to execute Java applications, so something similar to:\n#!/bin/bash\n\njava -jar /path/to/myfile.jar\n\nThen you just need to make that executable, using chmod and you can run it as you would any other shell script.\n\nA: I had installed jdk using sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk and jre using sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre but still I was facing this problem.

What is the difference?\n\nA: You can use dd or fallocate (or head or a few other tools) to create a file to act as your container. Then as Vincent Yu stated cryptsetup can handle the loop setup/teardown for you.\nfallocate -l 100M mypath/filecontainer\nsudo losetup # Debug for demonstration, not necessary in a real script\nsudo cryptsetup -y luksFormat mypath/filecontainer\nsudo losetup # Debug for demonstration, not necessary in a real script\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen mypath/filecontainer filecontainer\nsudo losetup # Debug for demonstration, not necessary in a real script\nsudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mapper/filecontainer\nsync\nsudo cryptsetup luksClose filecontainer\nsudo losetup # Debug for demonstration, not necessary in a real script\n\nIn the debug sudo losetup output, note the AUTOCLEAR = 1 for the filecontainer entry. You could instead go crazy with loopdev=$(sudo losetup -f); mount -o loop <etc>, but letting cryptsetup handle it is WAY nicer.\nThe key is you want to make sure you FIRST use cryptsetup luksOpen containerfile mappedname to have it mounted to /dev/mapper/mappedname by default (you can give it a full path starting with / and it will mount there instead I believe, and THEN format the /dev/mapper/mappedname target and makes sure you are NOT touching the filecontainer directly, otherwise you are bypassing the encryption engine and just creating an unencrypted loopback file.\n\nA: If you don't manage the loop device yourself, cryptsetup will automatically set up a loop device and close it when it is no longer needed. So there is no difference between the two; cryptsetup always works on the loop device. See man cryptsetup:\n\nNOTES ON LOOPBACK DEVICE USE\nCryptsetup  is usually used directly on a block device (disk partition or LVM volume). However, if the device argument is\n  a file, cryptsetup tries to allocate a loopback device and map it into this file. This mode requires Linux kernel  2.6.25\n  or  more  recent  which supports the loop autoclear flag (loop device is cleared on last close automatically). Of course,\n  you can always map a file to a loop-device manually. See the cryptsetup FAQ for an example.\nWhen device mapping is active, you can see the loop backing file in the status command output. Also see losetup(8).\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to manually start Juju hooks? I know you can debug hooks in error state by running juju debug-hooks nodemane and then running juju resolved --retry nodename. Is it possible to run or rerun hooks that are not in an error state?\nThanks\n\nA: Yes using actions https://jujucharms.com/docs/1.20/actions\nActions are exposed as of Juju 1.23. In Juju 1.22, they are only enabled in the CLI when JUJU_DEV_FEATURE_FLAG=actions is set.\nIf you don't need the hooks to execute in a 'hook environment' then you can just execute them via ssh as a normal script.\n\nA: An alternative way is to use 'juju run'.\njuju run --unit someunit/1 'hooks/some-hook'\nWhen using 'juju run' for a unit or all units of a service, the working directory is set to the charm, so you can access the hooks directly.\n", "Q: After dualboot installation, screen stopped working I had a dualboot working, but needed a fresh install.

You don't want to damage your system by carelessly installing hardware with short circuits. After that you can install the hardware and check if it is detected properly by looking into system logfiles.\nS.M.A.R.T.can be used to check the condition and wear of consumer HDDs and SSDs. You can run the Disks program from a live session which will display all SMART data for each drive in a submenu. The general recommendation is, if any of these values is not okay, then you shouldn't use the drive any longer and try to backup what you can. ddrescue is recommended over dd, but it should be noted that such programs put very much stress onto a device, so using dd to \"format\" a drive in an unknown condition may not be a good idea in the first place.\nA similar question has been posted on the Unix & Linux site of the StackExchange network (which AskUbuntu is part of): Hard disk drive disappeared\n", "Q: Bash script in terminal on boot Is there any way to run a .sh script in a terminal window on boot?\nMy computer boots slowly and I want to be able to press the button and leave to save a lot of time. \nThis script is a looping server and requires command input and monitoring. It must not run invisible or I will be unable to shut it down properly, which will result in damage to the files.\nUbuntu 14.04LTS 32bit\n\nA: You can try openvt , though interactive script on boot will be tricky.\nthis answer might help. answer implements openvt\n   link \n", "Q: How is a cubic root done in gnome-calculator?

Using the PPA repository, I added java 8.\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\nThat made java 8 the default. So, I tried to use update-alternatives to make java 7 the default.\nsudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java\n\nThat causes \njava -version\n\nto fail.\nIt looks as if the problem might be that there is a long list of alternatives for java, and I need to move them all around together. is there a way?\n\nA: Because Java is made up of many programs, you'll want to use update-java-alternatives instead. Run update-java-alternatives -l to get a list of installed Java environments. Then, to set an environment as the default, run update-java-alternatives -s codename, where codename is the first part of the output.\nFor example, I have OpenJDK 7 and 8 installed. Here's the output for me:\n07:52:36 ⌂134% θ70° [:~] $ update-java-alternatives -l\njava-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64 1071 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64\njava-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64 1069

Having just played around with Arch a little bit, the thing about it that impresses me the most about it is the AUR. With a tool like Yaourt, you can really easily install bleeding-edge software, some of which is from git, and it automatically compiles and installs it for you. Is there something like this for Ubuntu? I know about PPAs, but I don't really think they're an equivalent. \nEdit: here's why I don't really think PPAs are the same as the AUR: \n\n\n*\n\n*PPAs have compiled packages, while the AUR features both compiled packages and source packages, along with scripts for compiling them on any platform. This means that a PPA has to be maintained by someone who builds them, whereas with the AUR, uncompiled packages can be built on the user end. \n\n*Since PPAs are specific to the Ubuntu release, many PPAs are out of date. The packages would still work if the PPA maintainers would just update their PPAs to the latest version of Ubuntu, but often they go stale. Sometimes I've had to hack a PPA so that I can keep using the same package that worked in a previous release. \n\n*Many PPAs don't build properly, even though the projects are more or less stable. I'm thinking of FinalTerm, which mostly works, but the Ubuntu PPA almost never has passing builds, so it's impossible to install on Ubuntu without manually compiling. \n\n*PPAs don't seem have a rating system where users can vouch for working package repositories. I think this kind of consensus is very useful towards avoiding malware and/or non-working packages. \n\n*There are tons of AUR packages that come directly from GitHub, so installing a package like something-git will usually give you the latest package straight from GitHub. PPAs aren't updated dynamically like this, and so packages there are typically very out-of-date. \n\n\nA: Yes, PPAs. That's the closest you can get right now. If you don't think they're equivalent enough for you, then the answer right now is simply \"no\". Some comments on your claimed differences:\n\nPPAs have compiled packages, while the AUR features both compiled packages and source packages\n\nPPAs ship source packages too. PPA uploads must be source uploads. Users can access both the source (for example they can rebuild the sources themselves), or binaries built from those sources.\n\nSince PPAs are specific to the Ubuntu release, many PPAs are out of date.\n\nThis is true. However, users can quite easily copy a package from any PPA to their own PPAs, including to a different release, while choosing to rebuild them if necessary on the way. See the Package details -> Copy packages page. If there is anything that needs updating to work with a newer release then that won't work, but I presume that's the same with AUR.\nIn terms of PPAs being up to date, that is presumably simply a matter of volunteer time (who can do the same pocket copy as above), rather than any fundamental difference between PPAs and AUR.\n\nMany PPAs don't build properly, even though the projects are more or less stable\n\nSame answer as above. This has nothing to do with infrastructure or mechanism and everything to do with volunteer time.\n\nPPAs don't seem have a rating system where users can vouch for working package repositories.\n\nAgreed.\n\nThere are tons of AUR packages that come directly from GitHub, so installing a package like something-git will usually give you the latest package straight from GitHub.\n\nYou could arrange for this to happen automatically in a PPA, but I admit it is far from trivial to set up.\n\n\n*\n\n*Arrange for an automated VCS import from Github.\n\n*Create a build recipe.\n\n\nNone of this is exactly the same, I'll grant you. If you want more ABS/AUR -like functionality in Ubuntu, I think you need to go into more detail of how exactly your proposed changes would work in terms of what Ubuntu already has.\n\nA: Old question, outdated answers!\nThere's two alternatives you can take a look at:\nMPR - The makedeb Package Repository\nPacstall - The AUR for Ubuntu\nThey're both new-ish projects, but Pacstall's documentation is a bit sparse so I recommend MPR instead. MPR also has install helpers (akin to yay for the AUR) as well, such as una.\n\nA: Something similar could be https://launchpad.net/. \nAfter you register on Launchpad, you can make your own repo, which can be easily added to any Ubuntu with apt-add-repository command. A lot of interesing projects are running on private ppa repos, sometimes they provide the only solution to keep up-to-date older systems or abandoned softwares. Ofcourse, there are also ppa's with newer versions like the official Ubuntu repos. (I am using for example the ppa for LibreOffice - which provides the nightly builds of the named software.)\n\nA: I wanted to add an answer here because I too had asked myself the same question!\nAUR is not only like Ubuntu's PPAs but it's similar to the APT-BUILD also. AUR has a GUI app that allows you to first search the main repositories and if you don't find, or you rather compile the package from source, you can click on the AUR tab and find the package there, compile it, then install. Therefore, it's like our PPAs plus APT-BUILD.\nMy complaint about APT-BUILD is that I don't believe it truly accepts our configuration from the apt-build.conf. AUR will accept very find control over such things as CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and even the linker. If you were asking if Ubuntu had something like AUR because you wanted to creation something for us, I hope that you do! We need something beyond APT-BUILD and compiling it from CLI.\n\nA: AUR for the win! \n... but you might also like OCS-Store, \nwhere you can search and install AppImage files from the Apps category,\nfor example the Ungoogled Chromium.\nFor me, with large fonts, the layout is broken, so i have to scroll down for the 'Install' button.\nTo handle AppImage files more automatic, install AppImageLauncher\nYou also might have a look at SnapD and SnapCraft. [via Anbox the android emulator]\nsudo apt install snapd\n\n# for example ...\nsnap search anbox\nsnap install anbox\n# for anbox, you also need kernel modules, see\n# https://docs.anbox.io/userguide/install.html\n\n# update $PATH and run /snap/bin/anbox\nsource /etc/profile.d/apps-bin-path.sh\nanbox\n\n\nA: The main difference between PPAs & AUR is that PPAs are not likely to break your system, whereas with AUR, you get to break your installation at least once a week.  \nBut this is part of the kudos of being an Arch-user; because hey, if it ain't broken then it can't be fixed, and if you don't learn how to fix a broken installation then you don't learn how a Linux system really works.\n\nA: I have a script that can be used as an \"AUR\".\nIt is https://github.com/Felipecconde/br - A script called \"BashRun\".\nThis script runs any Bash script directly with a word (BR ID), or you can type the argument \"-u\" to run a Bash script by the link.\nYou can take a look at the BashRun official repository (You can upload your own scripts on it using the issue page on the GitHub page) by typing \"br appstore\" (or, directly, \"br repoappstore\").\nTo create a BR ID, just follow the steps at the BashRun help screen, typing \"br -h\".\nI will be happy if you can use it and help the project! :)\n", "Q: Question regarding dual boot (BIOS/UEFI, SSD) I'm totally new to ubuntu and want to ask some things before diving into it:\nFirst off I have an Asrock z77 extreme 4 and 1 SSD with Windows 7 installed.\nOn my second (empty) SSD I want to install ubuntu and I read that the setup is a bit different if you have UEFI firmware. \nMy mainboard is supposed to have UEFI and I naturally see the correspondant Interface when I go into the menu with 'del' on starting the PC. The problem is: When I search through \nC:\\Windows\\Panther\\setupact.log\n\nthere is\nCode:Callback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected boot environment: BIOS\n\nwhich confuses me. Normally UEFI would have to be specified at the end of the line and not BIOS.\nCan anyone explain that to me? \nCan I use this tutorial now: http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2014/05/31/dual-boot-ubuntu-14-04-windows-7-on-a-pc-with-2-hdds-and-uefi-firmware/\nor do I use the non-UEFI one? On the Boot menu of the UEFI interface i can specify PCI ROM priority (set to \"Legacy\" now, changeable to \"EFI compatible ROM\"). Does that cause this line in the logfile?\nFurthermore I have read that a swap partition is not good for the SSD and I understand the reasoning. Since I have 8 gigs of RAM it might not be necessary to create one. Is it recommended to use a programm for dynamic allocation of the swap area like Dynamic Swap Space Manager?\n\nA: Most modern computers support EFI, but most also provide a BIOS compatibility layer called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables booting in the older (BIOS, CSM, or legacy) mode. Thus, your computer may be using that mode and booting Windows much like an older computer would. If so, you should be sure to install Linux in the older BIOS/CSM/legacy way, too, because switching between boot modes can be a little awkward, or at least require special software. (GRUB can't do it, for instance, although my rEFInd can.)\nThe partition table your computer uses is the best clue to your Windows boot mode. Windows ties its partition table type to its boot mode; it boots to BIOS/CSM/legacy mode ONLY from MBR disks and to EFI/UEFI mode ONLY from GPT disks. See my page on this subject for more details, and also for tips on how to determine your boot mode in Linux. (You might want to drop to a shell and check to be sure you install Ubuntu in the way that matches your Windows boot.)\nAs to swap and SSDs, I wouldn't worry about it. Modern SSDs are much better able to cope with frequent writes than the ones sold a few years ago. Furthermore, if you're like most people, your swap space won't really see all that much use, so you probably won't overtax the SSD.\n", "Q: Apache won't start - PHP issues?

If you are not planning to use more than 4 partitions in the future - and it looks like you don't, as you want to assign all the available space - just delete it, and then extend your sda3.\nIn other words: sda4 is not an actual partition with files, and you don't have to worry about merging any data, just extend sda3.\n\nA: Extended partitions can certainly have data, traditionally it just meant that you had more than 4 primary partitions at one time.\nSOP is to find another disk, and copy the partitions, leaving space for your intended growth between them rather than after them.\nThen resize the filesystem to fill the larger partition. You can then copy the whole disk back.    \n", "Q: Install ChruBuntu on SD card or USB flash drive on Chromebook I have a question.

Here's a quick screenshot of a multi-tab session:\n\nqpdfview also offers an overview of all open tabs via the Tabs menu.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 14.10 create password protected archive I installed Kubntu 14.10 and when trying to create a new rar or 7z arhive, I see no option of adding a password to protect the file.

I then downloaded Java 7 JDK and configured it. I started Android Studio and it took me around three hours to download the packages, but afterwards it literally stops downloading further packages of \"Google repository support\" or something. So I decided to download Eclipse and work on it. Eclipse is not giving me any \"Android application\" submenu when I try to click New Project. I found out that in my ~/home folder I have an Android SDK folder. Many sites insisted that I should check it by running the command \"android\" in the terminal, but as expected it gave me an error that said: command not found. \nCan anyone please help me to configure Eclipse (I have already downloaded it from the Ubuntu Software Center) along with Android SDK? I can still open the Android SDK Manager, but I haven't got a clue how to manage the Android virtual device. I didn't even find out how to configure it.\n\nA: First of all I would like to thank all the repliers here who has motivated me to move ahead and find the solution.. Thank you @karel for editing my question and turning it into  meaningful and sensible...\nI have got the answer to configure it...i will explain all the step by step to configure eclipse and android sdk...\n1) download android sdk from the google site : http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html \nthis will give u a folder named android-sdk after you extract it in any of your desired location...move on to the directory, /home/'usr'/Android/Sdk/tools and you will find the file named \"android\"....open your terminal (shortcut key is alt + ctrl + t) and paste the file in terminal and execute that file..(you can also do it going to terminal using 'cd' command) ....once you press enter you will have the sdk manager screen and download  and install your desired packages...\n2) Now time to configure java...most of the time your eclipse supports java 7 jdk ...to configure java...as i mentioned earlier open up your terminal and type: sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk , or what you can do is you can open your software center and type java runtime on the search bar and you can install it from there too...\nto check whether you have configured your java or not , open up your terminal and write this code: java -version  and you will get output as shown below:\n3)its time to download eclipse now and configure it with Android sdk..\nopen your software center and type eclipse..\nafter you install it, open your eclipse software...\njust recalling it (you have now, android-sdk, java, and eclipse...)\nso after you got all your files..you need to download the adt(Android Development Tool) plugin...(and this is where I got stuck) \n4) you have your eclipse software now opened, so go to Help  -> Install New Software and you will get a screen for inputs\nyou will see a ADD button, click on it, and now you will be asked whether local or location, so in location type this address: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/ \nyou will get the names of all the plugins available and from this list, find out Android Development Tool listed and click next till you download and install it restart your eclipse \n5) now its time to point your eclipse to android sdk.\nafter you restart your eclipse it will ask you to point your sdk  \nclick browse and point your directory till /home/'usr'/Android/Sdk \n6) there you are, it will ask for further inputs from you and you can follow the screen.\n7) you can also see the virtual device option in eclipse if you have configured eclipse properly\nenjoy developing!! :-)\nlet me know if there are any issues faced...or if there is any mistake with these steps.\n", "Q: System boots directly in to Windows without showing boot-loader option I have installed  Windows 8.1 as dual-boot with Ubuntu 14.xx . dual boot of my system is working fine.... but last night boot-loader is not appearing and the system boots directly in to Windows,My BIOS is set to UEFI?\n\nA: If you are using the windows boot loader use \nbcdedit /timeout 15\n\nIf you are using grub use the Shift key, to get the menu.\n", "Q: Wifi not connecting Broadcom wireless I am new to Linux, so still don't understand much.  Last week I installed Ubuntu 14.04.2 on my laptop with a dual boot configuration with Windows 7.  At first, the wireless setup was not working.  After reading and searching the web, I found in the Broadcom website a Linux driver for the wireless device to be setup in Linux.  I followed the instructions, and after 30 minutes I finally got the driver installed and the wireless setup appeared in the menus.  I configured it to find my wifi, found it, but after a million tries, it keeps asking for the password and never connects.  I tested it on Windows, and I connect perfectly.  Then I disabled the security in my wifi router (turned off the WPA/WEP security) and voila, the network connected in Ubuntu Linux.  When I turn the security back on, it goes back to square one, asking for the password in a never ending cycle.  I have searched everywhere on this problem, found a lot of people have encountered the same issue, followed their steps to fix the connection, but still no avail.  I have reconfigured the network settings, driver, my router, and nothing. I doesnt want to accept the WEP/WPA security settings at all. Anyone have an easy fix other than the complex ones I have found on the web?\n\nA: *\n\n*Remove the driver that you installed, if do you have a fresh ubuntu install without data, please reinstall it, else try to uninstall the driver.\n\n*Assuming that do you have a wired, connection, connect it.\n\n*Install the package b43-fwcutter from the Software Center or with the command sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter\n\n*Reboot\n\n", "Q: Change kernel version from command line Is there a way to reboot with a different kernel version from the command line? \nI have Ubuntu PXE booted on a VM, and there is no graphical interface, but I need to downgrade the kernel (which is installed).\n\nA: Edit your grub configuration as necessary - if you want to use it for longer, and install the new grub setup then to disk(s).\nThis I believe will help you understand grub configuration:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Setup\nOtherwise I think kexec may also help you.\nInstall kexec with:\nsudo apt-get install kexec-tools\n\n\nA: *\n\n*If you want to one-time reboot selection consider using grub-reboot command;\n\n*If you want to set selection permanently use grub-set-default command.\n\n\nBot these commands require MENU-ITEM as parameter, for listing yours see:\nHow to list GRUB's “menuentries” in command-line?\n\nBut, you can always hold Shift while booting, to show Grub Menu, isn't it possible in your VM manager?\n", "Q: How to list GRUB's \"menuentries\" in command-line?

You can do this with:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure maas-cluster-controller\n\nAnd you need to input the IP address of the region controller in the form of:\nhttp://<ip-address>/MAAS\n\n\nA: In my case (new install using Ubuntu Juju) the problem was that neutron was misconfigured with the wrong ip address for the metadata server.\nThis is good: http://techbackground.blogspot.ie/2013/06/metadata-via-dhcp-namespace.html\nThat pointed me at: \nroot@neutron:/etc/neutron# cat metadata_agent.ini \n...\nnova_metadata_ip = 192.168.100.151\nnova_metadata_port = 8775\n...\n\nI fixed the nova_metadata_ip and restarted the neutron metadata service and that solved the issue.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with an 8-node deployment (3 controllers, 1 logging, 4 computes) where any instances created on the tenant network could not be logged into b/c they did not have the necessary SSH key installed via the metadata agent service. The nova console-log showed failed attempts trying to reach the metadata agent service on the tenant network neutron router gateway (192.168.227.1). If I logged into the neutron router and arping'd the instance, it would start to work. \nPerforming a packet capture on the compute node, I found the instance sending ARP requests for its Neutron gateway 192.168.227.1. The MAC returned was not a Neutron MAC, but rather a Cisco one. Because traffic is getting routed to that Cisco device (where no metadata service exists), requests to the metadata address failed.\nThe proposed solution was to confirm the possible existence of an SVI with 192.168.227.1 configured on it, and remove it since the address should be configured on the Neutron router.\nWhile editing the metadata_agent.ini file is a work-around, I would strongly caution using that as a 'fix' since those values are pulled from the openstack_user_config.yml file. If set correctly there, it should work as configured and with the default values in the .ini file.

If your hard-drive has bad sectors, it might be a little trickier, but because the system does boot, I'm thinking that there isn't any concerning corruption.\nThe following assumes that all your files are actually intact and not lost in a corrupted hard-drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu and log in to your account.\n\n*Open up Nautilus (your file manager), and create a new folder where you will be copying/moving your Windows files to. For the purpose of this tutorial, the folder will be called 'BACKUP'.\n\n*Open Nautilus in another window and look in the side panel for additional devices and drives. Determine which drive has your Windows installation on it.\n\n*Open the drive and navigate through the file system, clicking and dragging the desired files and folders to your BACKUP folder.\n\n*Wait until the processes complete, and you'll have a copy of your desired files under your Ubuntu installation.\n\n\nNote that you probably don't want to copy programs, .exe or .msi files, to your Ubuntu installation, since Linux can't natively run them.\nIf you can't access your Windows partition in Ubuntu, then there is probably something wrong with the file system or partition. If that's the case, it'll be more challenging to recover those files.

Now I am panicking whether that some of the partition cannot be recovered if I decide to remove Ubuntu and still won't get it back even when I delete the partition.

There might be something else going on in addition to what Takkat wrote, though, which might be a small part of the answer.\nDisk, partition, and filesystem sizes have long been measured in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using SI units -- power-of-10 multiples of bytes (B) or bits (b), as in kilobytes (kB, 1,000 bytes), gigabytes (GB, 1,000,000,000 bytes), or megabits per second (Mb/s, 1,000,000 bits per second).\n\n*Using IEEE 1541 units -- power-of-2 multiples of bytes (B) or bits (b), as in kibibytes (KiB, 1024 bytes) or gibibytes (GiB, 1,073,741,824 bytes).\n\n\nThe IEEE 1541 units are relatively new. In the past, SI prefixes were applied to both power-of-10 and power-of-2 units, with rounding occurring to get similar values -- for instance, \"kilo\" was applied to multiples of 1024. This was inaccurate when applied to power-of-2 units, but the difference was small. At the kilobyte scale (as for instance when measuring the capacity of 5.25-inch floppy disks), the difference is only 2.4%. The difference between an SI terabyte and an IEEE 1541 tebibyte, however, is almost 10%. Disk manufacturers tended to stick to the canonical SI meanings of the prefixes, probably because it made their disks sound a little bigger than they were, given that most everybody else used the power-of-2 meanings.\nToday, people unfamiliar with these distinctions can become confused when they see that their 4TB hard disk shows up in a disk utility as having just 3.6TiB of space. Both figures describe the same capacity, though.\nIn your case, the difference between a GB and a GiB is nowhere near enough to explain the difference you see. That's why I say that this distinction might be just a small amount of the effect, and Takkat's answer is probably the bulk of what's happening.\nAs a side note, please notice that I described an uppercase \"B\" as the abbreviation for byte and a lowercase \"b\" as the abbreviation for bit. In most contexts, a byte is 8 bits, so a 20Gb partition is really just 2.5GB. In the context of your question, your intended meaning (GB or GiB, not Gb) is clear, but that might not be the case in some situations. Data transfer rates are often expressed in (multiples of) bits per second, which can lead you to very wrong conclusions if you mis-read the abbreviation!\nAs a second side note, although a lot of programs and manufacturers are now taking greater care to distinguish between SI and IEEE 1541 units for disk capacities, RAM is still often being mis-measured using SI prefixes to refer to IEEE 1541 units. This is worth noting so that you don't misjudge something.\n", "Q: While installing ubuntu pc switches back to windows I am using a lenovo Z50-70 (intially with a free MSDOS os) now it has windows 8.1 .I have been trying to dual-boot ubuntu on my laptop and every time i select ...\n\"install ubuntu while keeping all files safe\" option, and i click continue...it asks for no partion nothing, INSTEAD IT SWITCHES BACK TO WINDOWS while installing ubuntu.\nPLEASE HELP\n\nA: As your problem seems to be a little bit vague, I try to guess a little bit.\nI guess you are in Windows8 and put in the Ubuntu-CD and use the installer.

I have a usb with two partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*the 1st is /dev/sdb/\n\n*and the second is /dev/sdc/\n\n\nThe two partitions are \"read only permission\". I try to remove this partitions and make a normal usb with programs like \"gparted, disk...\" but I can't. Someone help me please.\n\nA: The possibilities I can think of are:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are doing something very wrong. It is telling that you mention /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc. Those are normally different devices entirely, meaning that one of those is not your USB stick. Partitions would be e.g. /dev/sdb0 and /dev/sdb1. So make sure you are dealing with the devices you think you are. You may wish to take a look at the output of dmesg for some information about which device is which (e.g. dmesg | grep sdb and dmesg | grep sdc before and after inserting your stick).\n\n*You are not root, but you need to be, or at least you need to be logged in as some user that has write access to those /dev nodes.\n\n*If these partitions are part of the out-of-the-box configuration, often manufacturers will create a special partition for their own software and, via special programming in the controller, will not let you remove these partitions. Cruzer, for example, is particularly bad with this in my experience. In this case, there is nothing you can do.\n\n*If your USB stick has a write protect switch (relatively rare these days), turn it off. However, if you can currently write files to the existing partitions without issue, then that rules out this problem.\n\n*If your USB stick has failed or is about to fail, many manufacturers add code to the firmware to kick the stick into permanent read-only mode when failure is imminent. If this is the case, there is nothing you can do. However, if you can currently write files to the stick without issue, then that also rules out this problem.\nOf all the possible causes, those 5 are the most common. I believe 1 or 3 would be the most likely causes in your case.\n", "Q: SFTP Ubuntu 14.04 - Patient Records Download I need to build out a server for Insurance Companies / lawyers to download patient records.

A secure tunnel is a must for delicate data like this. \nIf I where you, I'd put something like a pfsense in front of that (a GW-Application, it also contains OpenVPN). At least put an iptables Firewall on the server itself, both would be even better.\nOn top of that, use a secured transportation. Vsftp(d) is quite a good choice for your endeavor.\nFor Storage:\nI'd recommend to use normal system-Users (maybe with encryted Home-Folders better yet a luks encrypted home partition?) and a disk quota could come in handy, too. \nI'd use an extra partition for /home\nFor the User:\nYou simply could use WinSCP or Filezilla, simple to work with, easy to install, works.\nFor your department:\nMake sure that the admin-interface of the web-application has limited access to the staff and admin only (Deny from All, Allow from IP('s)) via webserver config.\nIf your company has a fixed ip use an additional IPSEC-Tunnel to the GW-Application or to the server.\nConcerns about ssh logins:\nNo need for that if you disable password logins and activate ssh key only login.\n", "Q: Why did lolcat stop working after installing rvm?

If you could, I would do the following.\n1) enable automatic logging in and boot straight to command line\n2) gut (keep important stuff though) the /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc file and add the following:\nexec java -jar /path/to/jar.jar\n\n3) add in the rc.local to execute startx on boot\nThis should boot into your jar on boot.\nIf you can pull this off let me know, because I am working on a similar project.\n\nA: This is indeed one of the possibilities, here's a walkthrough for setting up mir and a simple QML based application and a video\n\nMy java knowledge is limited at best to get the other part of the question answered correctly.\n\n", "Q: How to fully remove all packages installed by 'gnome-session-fallback'?

When running a dumcap via Wireshark, I've noticed a couple of odd occurrences lately. Firstly, after disconnecting from my VPN, with the hypothetical IP address of 10.8.0.13, I see this:\n.............13.0.8.10.in-addr.arpa..................13.0.8.10.in-addr.arpa.....\n\nAnd let's say my VPN server IP is 123.456.78.91, than the queries look like this:\n9143    584.912799000   localhost   localhost   DNS 88  Standard query 0xc198  PTR 19.78.654.321.in-addr.arpa\n\nAnd of course, the answer to these queries are always this:\n9144    584.912945000   localhost   localhost   DNS 88  Standard query response 0xc198 No such name\n\nIt even happens for broadcast addresses:\n125 37.371037000    localhost   localhost   DNS 90  Standard query 0x8e53  PTR 250.255.255.239.in-addr.arpa\n\nEverytime this happens, the queries are followed by a bunch of 'conntecion resets' and other warnings. Is this normal? Is dnsmasq interfering with DNSCrypt-proxy? I tried running dnscrypt without a dns cache, but than I noticed that queries to my localhost and sometimes local network were being forwarded to the nameservers. And if that's not bad enough, I've had to reset my router twice in last week (OpenWRT) because sometimes DNS would break altogether, and Wireshark would show that my local domain, \".lann\" was being added to every single query the system made, for example: \naskubuntu.com.lann\n\nHow should I fix this? It seems my DNS is totally broken. I'm totally confused.\n\nA: while using tcpdump, use -n This will tell tcpdump to NOT to resolve any IP's or domain names.

So I just installed Ubuntu on my Chromebook. Now the main issue is that the internal memory is limited. I am thinking of using a 64 GB SD card to expend the memory. \nWould it run as smooth as it does now? I can jump from one system (Chrome OS) to an other (Ubuntu) in a split second.\n\nA: Yes, you could do this, however you should do a live install, instead of a full install. Live systems are designed to run from your computers RAM, and minimize the number of read/writes to the flash drive. This is important because flash drives have much more finite life spans than hard discs, and a full install, although possible, will burn the drive out quickly. It would also be very slow, trust me I tried it myself once...\nYou can use the Ubuntu startup disc creator, Unetbootin, or even the dd command to create the live system. These methods will work on both sd cards and USB discs.

It currently has Windows XP installed.\nI have very little knowledge of BIOS, but I did make it into the boot menu. I changed the directory to boot from the CD-ROM drive (external, as there is no installed drive). When I attempt to install Ubuntu 14.04.2 from a DVD, it shows a black screen with a cursor on it, but even after a few minutes, nothing appears on screen. Should I be seeing a landing page?\nI am also wondering if I should bother updating any drivers. I can't connect wirelessly right now, and I think the card cannot recognize WPA or any \"newer\" wifi routers. This laptop is circa 2005 iirc. Correct me if I'm wrong.\nAny help would be appreciated. I'm new but willing to learn. Thanks!\n\nA: Portege 3500's have a wide variety of boot options but only through a modified win98 boot disk still available from Toshiba(found it on the first page of search results when looking for how to install a new OPSYS.) It provides numerious options and drivers for USB,cardbus,PCMCIA drives and network installs.You will need a USB floppy drive,mine was a generic NEC drive and of course a blank disk. Unaware if you would need to modify the disks files. I know XP is setup to ignore Linux. As far as WiFi,the solutions I have seen require opening a terminal and utilizing the command line as well as inserting a script to make the connection automatic on boot. The problem seems to have something to do with the Toshiba cards firmware.\n  Ubuntu 14.xx.xx 32 bit might be a bit heavy for the 3500 as it was released in late 2002,has a Early PIII mobile and a max 1 Gig ram. A lighter distro with tablet functionality would most likely give a better result.  L.L.G.\n", "Q: The node /hbase-unsecure is not in ZooKeeper.

I have a large number of photos I would like to tag using data recorded with my GPS tracker. Ideally I would like to correlate the time-stamps of my photos with the positions reported by my tracker at those specific times. \nWhat's the fastest and easiest way to achieve this?\nNote: The pictures are standard jpeg files, the GPS data is formatted as a KML file.\n\nA: CLI solution \nOverview\nWhen dealing with metadata of any sort exiftool should always be the utility of choice. It comes with a plethora of different options and commands that allow you to tag images at your will.\nFor instance, if you want to tag all images in a specific folder with the geodata provided by a KML file you can use the following commands:\ncd image_folder\nexiftool -geotag gps.kml *.jpg\n\nOf course there are far more options and settings available. For all the intricate details surrounding GPS-tagging with exiftool I'd advise you to consult this section of the exiftool documentation.\nInstallation\nexiftool is part of the official Ubuntu repositories and can be installed with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl\n\n\nGUI solution\nOverview\nThere are multiple front-ends to exiftool available. GPicSync is one that specializes in Geotagging images. The interface is simple and easy to use:\n\nHaving specified the image folder and the GPS file you want to use, you simply click on Synchronize to update the image metadata with GPS tags. \nAdditional options allow you to set a time offset and to even view your images in Google Earth.\nInstallation\nInstalling GPicSync requires manually setting up its dependecies and downloading the python source code. There have been calls to package GPicSync in Ubuntu/Debian, but all available packages are outdated.\nHere are the steps you will have to follow to install and set up GPicSync:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install all dependencies\nsudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl python-unidecode python-imaging python-wxgtk2.8\n\n\n*Check out the latest python source\ngit clone https://github.com/notfrancois/GPicSync.git\n\n\n*Navigate to the cloned folder, make GPicSync executable, and run it:\ncd GPicSync\nchmod +x gpicsync-GUI.py\n./gpicsync-GUI.py\n\nThat's it. GPicSync should be up and running. To better integrate the app into your system you could look into creating a launcher for it.\nI have tested these installation instructions on Ubuntu 12.04. Package names and dependencies might differ on newer releases.\n\nConverting between different GPS data formats\nOverview\nOne downside to GPicSync is that it only supports two input formats, GPX and NMEA. Compared to exiftool that's very little. However, if need-be you can always convert between different GPS data formats by using GPSBabel. E.g., to convert from KML to GPX you could use the following command:\ngpsbabel -i kml -f gps.kml -o gpx -F gps.gpx\n\nAnother option would be to use one of the many online converters such as this one.\nInstallation\ngpsbabel is part of the official Ubuntu repositories and can be installed with:\nsudo apt-get install gpsbabel\n\nFurther reading on gpsbabel usage.\n", "Q: Alternative to iTunes for syncing with iPhone? iTunes software is needed to sync Musics and Videos with Apple iPhone which I have.\nDoes Ubuntu have something for alternative iTunes?\nMobile Ubuntu has not been published yet in Seoul, Republic of Korea where I live.\n\nA: Amarok and, if I recall correctly, Banshee, have some level of support for syncing music with iPhone.

Just want to write here for formatting and length.\nOk a couple questions I have...  You use network manager(default wireless connection program in Ubuntu) to pick network and enter password, correct?  It appears as thought your AP Bell76 is the issue.  It is sending Deauth packets to your wireless card which causes your card to gladly disconnect. The network-manager then automatically connects again until it receices the next Deauth packet.  This is what causes the drop in wifi server I believe.\nThe line that causes me to think this is from your syslog as seen below.\nMar 20 21:29:57 bbpgrs-VPCEH18FA kernel: [ 8419.673299] wlan0: deauthenticating from d8:6c:e9:24:55:85 by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)\n\nReason code 3 means:\n3   station is leaving (or has left) IBSS or ESS\n\nSo to me it seems to be that the router is sending a deauth packet.  Now if it is a directed packet(only addressed to your MAC) or if it is a broadcast deauth(a deauth packet sent to everyone on the wire) I do not know.  This could be caused by several things.\nDo you live around other people or is your house out of range of any other wireless networks?\nWhat router do you have? \nEDIT\nSomething else I noticed is that your txpower is kinda low, don't know if it is because your card is only capable of 20 or if you set it like that.  You might consider raising the TX power, this may help your signal but also may cause your wifi card to run hotter.\nTry:\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 txpower 30\n\n", "Q: procedures for creating the bootable usb not working for me Paragraphs 2-4 comprise my original elaboration on this problem.

Thx.\n\nA: Fist step after an installation always is to upgrade all packages including open source graphic drivers to get bugs fixed. This can be done from a terminal or TTY even if graphics are not working: \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIn general, for an AMD card, the Open Source radeon driver is supported very well and should only be replace by a proprietary driver in case of issues.\nIf after that we still had grahics card issues we should proceed using the tested drivers from the official Ubuntu repositories accessible via System settings > Software & Updates > Additional Drivers (proprietary drivers (restricted) repository needs to be activated first):\n\nHere shown for Nvidia\nIf after that the issue was not resolved we may look for a repository, a ppa or a Debian package providing a more recent graphics driver for your specific AMD card. This will already introduce a high risk of making your system instable but in case your system breaks at least it can usually be reverted.\nOnly if after all that the issue still was not resolved we may try our luck with downloading the bleeding edge untested newest and possibly buggy driver from the manufacturer website. This may also involve runnign a proprietary installation with a custom-made install script. In case our system does not work afte that we can not easily revert the changes we had made. So this step really should be a last resort reserved for rare cases that can not be resolved otherwise (e.g. a brand new high end card). Before you do that you should read other people's experiences, and you should also be sure that your issue will be resolved.\nAlso see\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD?\n\n*AMD/ATI drivers from website vs. proprietary drivers in Ubuntu 12.04 Repos?\n\nA: The drivers for all of AMD's graphic cards are at their website here http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/. The first thing you should do is to download the appropriate driver(s) for your system. \nNext, install the operating system. Don't worry if the graphics don't work after install. Once system boots up, press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to go to one of virtual consoles. From there you can install the driver. \n\nA: Seems that the Ubuntu 14.04 is too old for your graphics card (both card and the OS are released almost at the same time). The Live-mode runs free driver from the Linux kernel which can't handle your graphics card properly.\nSo, try Ubuntu 14.04.4 that ships modern kernel 4.2.

How can I install a .deb file in Ubuntu-Touch?\n\nA: While technically you can download a .deb and install it, it's probably not a good idea in many instances.\nYou need to make the phone read-write (it ships read-only by default) which is not a good idea for most non-developers because the archive used for the phone isn't the full archive, so you may not even find the deb you want. We don't test apt-get installed scenarios on the phone and if you use apt-get upgrade, you may install packages which haven't yet been fully tested as part of image based updates.\nThat said, you can make the phone read-write:-\nadb shell\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /\n\nYou can then install a deb using usual tools:-\nsudo dpkg -i PackageName.deb\n\nHowever, you can break the phone and may need to re-flash from scratch if it breaks.\n", "Q: Get the download link of file downloaded in Software Center I am really asking a question which is many times tagged as [DUPLICATE] but I found no answer. I am downloading FLIGHTGEAR Game which is 1.0 GB with software Center. Unfortunately the power cuts off and download stops and the download speed there is also low. I restart download each time. It gets downloaded 700 MB then power cuts off and when i restart computer and starts download again, it initiates from 0 KB and this process goes on. Please show me the way to get its download link to be used in a download manager and get rid of the problem. Any type of help will be appreciated.

It is however a reasonable threshold, to prevent unintended access (mounting) to a specific partition or drive.\n\nAn option, that also can be used as a more temporary solution on any user account is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the following to the sudoers file (/etc/sudoers, running sudo visudo):\n<your_friends_username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/umount\n\nThis will enable him to unmount a drive without sudo password\n\n*In your friends' account, copy the script below into an empty file and save it somewhere as nomount.py (or better, a less revealing name :) )\n\n*Test-run (still in your friends' account) the script by the command:\npython3 /path/to/nomount.py /mnt/data\n\nand try to mount the drive.

If so, it will immediately (forcefully) unmount the drive, with the command umount -f <drivename>.\nEdit\nA bash version of the script:\n#!/bin/bash\ndrive=\"$1\"\nwhile true\ndo\n    if [ -n \"$(lsblk | grep $drive)\" ]; then\n        sudo umount -l $drive\n    fi\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\nSet up and use it similarly to the python script, only:\n\n\n*\n\n*save it as nomount.sh\n\n*run it by the command:\nsh /path/to/nomount.sh /mnt/data\n\n(like the python version; use the drive to make unavailable as an argument)\nEdit 2\nAbout security:\nWith the right skills and information, practically all solutions can be surpassed. A simple example: with enough time, all solutions would break by simply starting up from a startup usb, unless you encrypted the drive.\nIn the solution above, the most obvious way would be to open a terminal window, run ps -u <username>, look for the process to kill (the script), and kill it. Your friend would however need to have the skills to do that, the intention to do that and the knowledge to suspect that it is done this way.\nYou can make the process less likely to be recognized, by a few simple additions to the setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Give the script a disguising name like unity-desk (I checked if the name didn't clash with an existing command) without extension*\n\n*Make it executable, to be able to run it without the preceding sh or python3. \n\n\nThis way, you can run the script with the command:\nunity-desk /mnt/data\n\nIn both ps -u <username> and ps -e the process would be mentioned as unity-desk. Not really a process (-name)  you'd likie to kill on first sight.\nThe command to reveal the fact that it is a script would be to run ps -ef which would show the path and the language. However, that would however again be a step further.\n\nA: After a long search I've found what the problem was.

That method worked when it comes to Linux Mint 17.1 and Clonezilla live CD, but when I tried to create bootable USB for Ubuntu 14.04 or Kubuntu 15.04 beta 1 there was an error copying files.

I don't happen to have a 15.04 beta CD image handy, but I do have a 14.10 image, and I ran the command against it:\n$ find /mnt/cdrom -type l \n/mnt/cdrom/dists/stable\n/mnt/cdrom/dists/unstable\n/mnt/cdrom/ubuntu\n\nThose are all the symbolic links on the image file. I can't say I know precisely why they're there. If you can install from a medium that lacks these links, though, chances are everything will be fine and there will be no long-lasting problems caused by the fact that your installation medium lacks these links.\nOne more point: My preferred method of creating a Linux installation medium is to use dd, thus:\nsudo dd if=imagefile.iso of=/dev/sdc\n\nChange the if= and of= values as necessary.

Your best bet is probably going to be something like filtering on the description, although I believe that most scripts that need to know this right now simply hardcode the list since it changes infrequently.\nAlso, please don't use \"edge\", as it's long-obsolete and exists only for compatibility.

LTS are the longest supported so there'll never be a non-LTS outliving an LTS. Eg:\n>>> [s.name for s in lp.distributions['ubuntu'].series if s.active][-1]\n'precise'\n\nAlso, LTS's are released in April of even-numbered years, so to get ALL currently supported LTS you could do a trick like this:\n>>> [s.name for s in lp.distributions['ubuntu'].series if s.active and s.version.endswith('.04') and not int(s.version.split('.')[0]) % 2]\n['trusty', 'precise']\n\n", "Q: How to customize login screen for Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS is there a way to customize the login screen for Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS.

For your instance, test must exist in /tftpboot.\nYou can see the reason in the tftp man page BUGS section.\nI'm struggling to solve how to put a new file via tftp, but still don't know how.\n\nA: Check syslog and you will see that :\n tftpd: serving file from /srv/tftp\n\nBasically there is a bug and you will need in your case to move all files from the folder /tftpboot to /srv/tftp (make the folder /srv/tftp if doens't exist) and make sure you give 777 permissions and to all file inside, restart xinetd and it will works!\n\nA: This could be because 14.04 has a tftp server setting in /etc/inetd.conf:\n#BOOT: TFTP service is provided primarily for booting.  Most sites\n#       run this only on machines acting as \"boot servers.\"\ntftp    dgram  udp wait    nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /srv/tftp\n\nyou can comment out this line and try again. \nI got this from here:\nhttp://www.beer.org/blog/tftpd-and-xinetd-on-ubuntu.html\n\nA: As leondgarse mention, you cannot upload new files directly with your settings. But you can add \"-c\" to server_args, like:\nservice tftp\n{\n   protocol = udp\n   port = 69\n   socket_type = dgram\n   wait = yes\n   user = nobody\n   server = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd\n   server_args = -c -s /tftpboot\n   disable = no\n}\n\nFor detail, you can see man page of \"in.tftpd\":\n   --create, -c\n          Allow new files to be created.  By default, tftpd will only allow upload of files that already exist.  Files are created with default permissions allow‐\n          ing anyone to read or write them, unless the --permissive or --umask options are specified.\n\n\nA: In my case it (Debian 9.9) I resolve it by editing /etc/inetd.conf and modifying the line :\n\ntftp            dgram   udp     wait    nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd \n  /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /srv/tftp\n\nby\n\ntftp            dgram   udp     wait    nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd \n  /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /tftpboot\n\nThe file \"/etc/xinetd.d/tftp\" was not reading.\n\nA: Not sure if this is something with the design of TFTP but when doing a put it does not let you create a file.\nSolution:\nCreate the file before hand and give 777 rights. Run transfer again and it should work.\n\nA: Please check the files mode bits.\nIn my case, the tftp root directory is /opt/tftpboot/\nUsing ls -l command, I could see the file mode was 600, so when I try to access tftp to get this file with anonymous, it reports an access violation.\nThis may be the cause of this error. But there may be another reason for it.\n\nA: Troubleshooting TFTPD Server on Ubuntu 14.0.4 by Dayanand Ambawade\nStep-1: Edit /etc/inetd.conf\ntftp    dgram  udp wait    nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /srv/tftpboot\nStep-2: Write script for tftpd\nsudo nano /etc/xinetd.d/tftp\nservice tftp\n{\n   protocol = udp\n   port = 69\n   socket_type = dgram\n   wait = yes\n   user = nobody\n   server = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd\n   server_args = /srv/tftpboot -s\n   disable = no\n}\n\nStep-3: Create Directory and set the permissions\nsudo mkdir /srv/tftpboot\nsudo echo \"Test TFTP Server\" > /srv/tftpboot/test.txt\nsudo chmod 777 -R /srv/tftpboot\nsudo chown -R nobody.root /srv/tftpboot\n\nStep-4: Start service\nsudo service xinetd restart\nsudo service inetutils-inetd restart\n\nStep-5: Test Server\necho \"get test.txt\" | tftp 127.0.0.1\ncat test.txt\nTest TFTP Server\n\nHopefully this will solve the problem.\nRegards\n", "Q: How to change a specific third level character?

You will see the parent folder (e.g. 2012, then go to the empty folder, e.g. December) and then you can delete it.\nClick for bigger image.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Print only one line at a time from text file how can I print or display only word from a text file at a time.\nWhen I run my script it should only display each word from the text file one by one, but only display that word.\nThis is what I have done, but it displays each word on separate line, but it shows all of them:\nFS=$'\\n'      \nfor j in `cat read`\ndo\n    echo \"$j\"\ndone\n\nI want the output to look something like this:\nroot@matrix:~> first word  ---> this word disappear when second is displayed\nroot@matrix:~> second word ---> this disappear when third is displayed\nroot@matrix:~> third word  ---> this disappear when fourth is displayed and continues like this to the end of the file!\n\n\nA: You can use sleep and clear commands in your script as following:\nfor word in $(< read)\ndo\n    echo \"$word\"\n    sleep 1\n    clear\ndone\n\nExplanation:\nThe sleep command make delay for a specified amount of time (in seconds). With sleep 1 delay would be for 1 second. You can change for more time delay by incrementing the second parameter or for delaying less than 1 second divide it to low units; Like sleep .1 for 1/10 second delay or sleep .001 for 1/1000 second delay and etc.\nThe clear command clear the terminal screen.\nEven better you can do this through below awk command:\nawk '{i=1; while(i<=NF){ print $((i++)); system(\"sleep 1; clear\") }}' read\n\nExplanation:\nIn awk, the NF specifies the total number of fields in the current input record/line, so by using a variable as a counter (i) and looping over it, we are printing all of them from 1st position to the end of them (NF). Then by using the system(\"sleep 1; clear\") part, we are telling to awk to calling the system commands to sleeping for 1 second and clearing the screen.\n\nIn above we are displaying the input file as word by word. If you are going to display it line by line add IFS=$'\\n' in the script like:\nIFS=$'\\n'\nfor word in $(< read)\ndo\n    echo \"$word\"\n    sleep 1\n    clear\ndone\n\nAnd change the awk command like:\nawk '{ $0; system(\"sleep 1; clear\") }1' read\n\n\n\n*\n\n*$0 specifies the current line. and the 1 on end enables the default awk's print command. \n\n\nA: With bash, I'd do:\nwhile IFS=$'\\n' read -r line\ndo\n    printf \"%-${COLUMNS}s\\r\" \"$line\"\n    sleep 1\ndone < file\n\nBy using the carriage return (\\r) instead of line feed (\\n), you can overwrite the current line. The -${COLUMNS} pads the output with spaces so that previous lines are completely overwritten.\nFor a per-word solution, I think a double loop is needed:\nwhile read -ra line\ndo \n    for word in \"${line[@]}\"\n    do\n        printf \"%-${COLUMNS}s\\r\" \"$word\"\n        sleep 1\n    done\ndone < file\n\n", "Q: How to use Higan 094 on Ubuntu? I installed higan emulator (I'm running a virtual machine with Ubuntu 14.10 in a windows 8 notebook) to play some SNES games. The problem is that higan only gives me a black screen and a library screen. So how am I supposed to access settings? (there is no button, no nothing).

The first number is some kind of controller ID and the following maps the buttons. My controller ID happens to be 64db7df00e8f0003. My second question was if somebody knew how to get this number. Using the 'evtest' it says: 'Input device ID: BUS 0x3 vendor 0xe8f product 0x3 version 0x110', so I see where some parts of the ID comes from.

As long as my TV was on when the system is booted everything is fine (audio and video).  However if I turn the TV and leave it off, the next time I turn it on, the bottom half of the display gets distorted.  I tried switching to the proprietary ATI driver but that didn't help this problem.  The top half is still the correct resolution but just the bottom half is messed up.  The only way to get the screen correct again, that my limited knowledge knows, is to reboot the system.  I'm assuming the problem has to do with the computer recognizing that there is no connection on the HDMI when the TV is turned off but not readjusting when the TV is turned back on.\nIdeally, there'd be a setting to have the computer ignore when the TV is turned off and never change the display as a result of the TV being turned off.\nIf that can't be achieved, is there a way I can reset the video without restarting the whole system from the command line (or a script)?\n\nA: There are two different fixes that I've found.\nIf I sudo apt-get install fglxr instead of just relying on the the Additional Drivers gui then it seems to work.\nThis method has the downside of VDPAU not working.  It complains of a missing nvidia file which is obviously a contradiction as it's an AMD card.\nIf I use the OS driver the vdpau works but the screen does the weird distortion thing after it has been power cycled.  Instead of rebooting the computer I can run DISPLAY=:0 xrandr -q to see the device name of my TV then run \nDISPLAY=:0 xrandr --output HDMI-0 --off\nDISPLAY=:0 xrandr --output HDMI-0 --auto\n\nto reset the display.  With that command I can make a script which I can map to a hotkey which I can map to my remote to make the glitch essentially non-existent.  \nThe second solution was courtesy of this post on forum.kodi.tv.\nThere was a third (actually first but it didn't work) solution proposed of saving the firmware edid (I'm probably not using one or both of those terms correctly) to a file and forcing its continued use which, for me, didn't work.\n", "Q: not able to boot any OS Windows or Ubuntu My system is Samsung laptop with a 128GB samsung ssd I've installed Ubuntu as dual-boot with Windows from live USB.

When you compile c/c++ code on a linux machine it (typically) forms an ELF binary, which windows (and mac) cannot use. You can, however, use mingw-w64 to crosscompile from a linux host to a windows binary, and you can do similar things for cross compiling to mac (but the process is by and far more complicated).\nThen comes the fact you mention libcurl. Perhaps you just compiled the source of that, or you wrote your own program that depends on libcurl. In the former case, the presence of libcurl on the target machine does not matter, in the latter, depending on whether you static or dynamicly link libcurl into the program, you may need the appropreate library (dll or dynlib) on the target machine.\nRegardless, across widely differing operating systems one cannot simply copy/paste a binary from one to the other and expect it to work.

So, the new sed command will work for all mentioned cases. \n\nA: with awk it is much simpler syntax\nawk -F, '{print $4\",\"$5\",\"$6\",\"$1\",\"$2\",\"$3}' file.txt\n\n\nA: The golden rule of regular expressions is \"less is more\". You should always try to write the simplest regex that matches your data. That not only makes it much easier to read and understand, it is also much more robust and won't break with small changes in format. So, in your case, you could simply do:\n$ sed -r 's/(.*), ([^,]+,[^,]+,[^,]*$)/\\2\\1/' file \nFriday, Mar 13,2015 16:59:42blah, blah, blah, \nFriday, Mar 13,2015 16:51:11yadi, yadi, yada, \n\nThat matches everything from the beginning of the line until a comma and space ((.*),) and, because the pattern is surrounded by parentheses, saves it as \\1. Now, because the second captured group (second pattern in parentheses) goes up to the end of the line (that's what the $ means), we know we're matching the right part in the first one. \nThe second looks for a stretch of one or more non-comma characters ([^,]+), a comma, another set of non-commas, another comma and then as many non-comma characters as possible until the end of the line. That way, we can correctly identify the last fields as the date. The s/// is the substitution operator which here simply switches the order of the 1st and 2nd captured pattern.\nYou could also do the same thing in awk. Presumably, the text before the date is variable so we can't assume the same number of fields for each line. Therefore, we will need to count the fields backwards from the end of the line:\n$ awk -F, '{ \n            printf \"%s,%s,%s, \", $(NF-2),$(NF-1),$NF; \n            for(i=1;i<NF-3;i++){printf \"%s,\", $i} print $(NF-3)\n         }' file \n Friday, Mar 13,2015 16:59:42, blah, blah, blah\n Friday, Mar 13,2015 16:51:11, yadi, yadi, yada\n\nOr in Perl:\n$ perl -lpe 's/(.*), ([^,]+,[^,]+,[^,]*$)/\\2, \\1/' file \nFriday, Mar 13,2015 16:59:42, blah, blah, blah\nFriday, Mar 13,2015 16:51:11, yadi, yadi, yada\n\n$ perl -F, -lane 'print join \",\",@F[$#F-2,$#F-1,$#F,0..$#F-3]' file \n Friday, Mar 13,2015 16:59:42,blah, blah, blah\n Friday, Mar 13,2015 16:51:11,yadi, yadi, yada\n\n", "Q: Suddenly cannot switch keyboard layouts All of a sudden the keyboard layout icon disappeared from my bar, and even the keyboard short-cut that I usually use to switch between german and russian layout stopped working.\nThe \"Text Entry\" settings screen is now also completely unusable - none of the UI elements work there.

I am building a computer and have a 1 TB hard drive and a 250GB SSD. I would like to install both OS on the SSD and have them both be able to access the HD. Would it work to install both on the SSD and just partition the HD in half? \nHow should I dual-boot Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu on two storage devices?\n\nA: Yes, it's definitely possible and the Ubuntu installer allows it when choosing the option \"something else\". Just plan the partition layout of both drives accordingly. You can create the partitions beforehand with GParted, if you feel more comfortable with that tool.\nIn my personal experience, the Windows installer doesn't like some partitioning schemes (with its boot and recovery partitions and whatnot), even though they should be fine, so\n\n\n*\n\n*I usually start out with an empty partition table and then create the partition(s) for Windows from its installer with the desired size(s),\n\n*then I create the partition(s) for Linux/Ubuntu from a live DVD/USB (optionally), and\n\n*finally I install Ubuntu with the \"something else\" option, creating and/or assigning all the partitions as needed.\n\n\nA: For a beginner I would recommend disconnecting the 1 TB from the motherboard while installing windows and ubuntu on the SSD. I would partition the disk before installing either OS. Also for a beginner I would install windows first. Then install Ubuntu. If you are not a beginner and are versed in partitioning disks and OS installs then disregard the previous. Connect the 1 TB disk again. Once you are done boot to windows 8.1. You will want to disable Fast Startup because in this mode when windows shuts down it hibernates all your hard disks rather than truly powering them off. When you boot ubuntu after a windows 8.1 shutdown you will not be able to access any NTFS partitions from ubuntu. You will get a read/write error saying that disks were not shut down properly to boot into windows and correct this. This does not apply to the Restart function. Here is a link to do this.

It worked fine with Xsane on 12.10.\nNow I have the strange effect that I can use the scanner with scanimage all the time, but as soon as I use Xsane or any other frontentd, it does only produce black images (the scanner does not move at all). Occationally I can scan once (mostly preview) and the second attempt produces only black again. I can use scanimage afterwards and it is fine. \nSeems to be a kind of reset problem to me, because when Xsane comes up and the scanner makes a short noise, the first scan seems to work. Also when you scan, the scan arm does not return to the start position. Afterwards it creates black images.\nThe reset problem occurs with other front-ends as well.\nSuggestions welcome. Running the latest 1.0.25 sane version (compiled from source). Also the default install did not work before, hence I tried my luck with latest.\nAny debug help welcome.\n\nA: Ok. Solved the mystery myself. It is related to USB autosuspend. It seems to kick in too early and the UIs do not wakeup the device properly, only scanimage does it. \nI use TLP to control powersaving settings. So I got the device id using lsusb and added it to the USB_BLACKLIST line of the tlp configuration file found at /etc/default/tlp. Works as expected right now. \nTook my 10 hours to figure it out, because similar cases had always some different reasons or stayed unanswered.\nThere is probably a different way to put the device on the blacklist.
