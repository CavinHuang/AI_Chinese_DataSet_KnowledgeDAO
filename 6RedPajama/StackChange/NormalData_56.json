["Q: How do I save a text file with a Ruby (.rb) file extension? I am new to Ruby and am trying to learn from a book. However, I have one problem – it says I should save a file so that it ends with .rb but my Mac only lets me use .rtf so that's what I used. But the next thing I needed to do was open it in Terminal and the command cd /Users/username/ruby didn't work for me. I'm guessing the reason for this is because I didn't use .rb it didn't work.\nSo my question is: What should I use for writing Ruby in the end of that command, or for saving with the .rb extension?\n\nA: You could only save as .rtf because the file was rich text. To make it plain text, simply press ⇧ shift-⌘ command-T or go Format > Make Plain Text, then you can save as .rb.\nTry not to use TextEdit: there is no syntax highlighting and code completion, not to mention that you have to manually turn off those wrong quotation marks.\n\nA: What you do is get yourself a proper code editor or IDE. Using TextEdit to write code is a very bad idea. Personally I'd recommend Sublime Text 3 because it has good text highlighting for many different languages, is free (well technically isn't, but for learning like you're doing, not buying a license should be ok), and is pretty lightweight but you should do some research and reach your own conclusions about which code editor or IDE is right for you.\n\nA: Could always use good ole vim YOURFILENAMEHERE.rb within Terminal. \nWhen you want to type, enter insertion mode by pressing i; if you want to exit insertion mode, press ESC. Then to save your file just press :wqEnter (save and then quit).\nOf course you miss out on all of the IDE features but it's a great text editor that is built in.\n", "Q: Can't hear WhatsApp voicenotes on my ear; only on loudspeaker Recently, out of nowhere, I lost the ability to listen to WhatsApp voice notes whenever I take the phone to my ear. When I do, I get the silent logo sign of iPhone, while in fact the phone is not silent. Also the volume is not low and is to maximum.\nWhenever I take the phone away from my ear, the voice note plays normally on the loudspeaker.\n\nA: Ok just open any voice message and take your phone close to ear, now press volume button to make the sound high. Actually you removed the voice totally when you was hearing the message before as some times it’s very loud and we trying sometimes to make the voice less for privacy for sourrondings.\n", "Q: Cannot import AVCHD into final cut pro x \n\nI have a folder called \"from camera\" that contains an AVCHD component. \nI recorded my videos using a SONY-X70.\nI cannot import my media into fcpx. When i use the media importer in FCPX it tells me no importable files as describe in the pictures.\nHow can I import media into FCPX ..AVCHD\nall help is appreciated \n\nA: If the contents of the AVCHD have been altered or become corrupted, FCPX may be unable to import it. Utilities such as Panasonic's (free) AVCCAM restorer will attempt to reconstruct the AVCHD file structure. Backup your file before you attempt it. \nIn the event that the software cannot restore the file, it may be possible to extract the .MTS / .M2TS files from within the bundle, make a copy, place them within a folder, and seek to restore the contents of that folder separately. \nThere are also utilities such as FFMPEG that can easily and almost instantly convert stream files (for example the individual .mts / .m2ts files) and re-wrap them as .mov files. Be aware that converting stream files directly to .mov or .mp4 files may lose useful information which would normally be present within the AVCHD structure.\nPanasonic publish various utilities for AVCHD and AVCCAM file structures on the Panasonic pro camera download site.\n", "Q: AppleScript: copy file to clipboard So I've got the following: \nset mypath to /Users/myuser/Desktop/file.pdf\n\nI want to copy the file of this path to my clipboard. How to I do this? \nI tried: \nset the clipboard to the file mypath\n\nThis does not work. Any idea? I just want to be able to copy this file to any application using the clipboard. \n\nA: There are several clipboards, so even if your file managed to fit in the clipboard, all applications is so broad that it's certain many or most will not grab the file contents as you expect/intend and instead grab a name of the file or pe haps the path. \nThe receiving application decides what to pull off the clipboard and not the script that places something in the clipboard. \nYou'll likely need to write specific scripts for specific apps and potentially re-evaluate AppleScrips since it might not be the correct tool for this job. \n", "Q: Apple Wireless Keyboard A1314 tilde key It looks like keys with tilde ` and section § glyph are not working with OS X. I found a question on Official Apple Support Communities but there is no usable answers.\nI highlighted a keys that does nothing.\n\nI checked that on OS X Sierra on my MacBook 12\" and on hackintosh with El Capitan 10.11.6. I do not have older version of Apple desktop OS to check that keys is physically working and not broken inside or on keyboard logic board.\nI think that keys must be physically okay because this keyboard was into cardboard packaging as I bought it for a few years and now I found it and want to use with latest OS X.\nOnly workaround I found is open keyboard window and click that keys if I want to print them. But I'm a programmer and it's not really handy.\n\nA: I'm not 100% clear on what you're asking, but what I can tell you is:\n\n\n*\n\n*I use a number of Apple Wireless A1314 keyboards with various iMacs and MacBook Pros and the tilde ~ key works fine on all of them. \n\n*I haven't actually used any of this model keyboard on a Mac running macOS Sierra, but I have on Macs running Mac OS X Snow Leopard all the way up to Mac OS X El Capitan and the ~ key works fine on all of them.\n\n*If you actually meant the ` key (which on my keyboard is the same physical key as the tilde ~ key), then this also works on all of them.\n\n*As for the Section Sign (§), I've always achieved that with a option6 keyboard shortcut (i.e. there is no physical key labelled as § on any of my Apple Wireless A1314 keyboards.\n\n\nIf the above isn't helpful, you could try starting your Mac in Safe Mode just to see if that makes any difference in your scenario.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of whether your keyboard now works as you want?\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restart your Mac as normal\n\n*Test your keyboard again\n\n\nOnce you've tested in Safe Mode and afterwards, let us know how you went.\n\nA: This was really supposed to be a comment, as I'm just throwing around guesses, but it got too long.\nI've had a similar issue before where these exact keys input the wrong characters. You're saying they just don't seem to work, so I'm not sure if this is the same problem or not.\n\nThe problem I'm talking about is one that may present itself when you ignore the Keyboard Setup Assistant first time you plugin the keyboard  or if you accidentally press a wrong key in the Keyboard Setup Assistant. \n\n...the solution to the above problem is to redefine the keyboard type:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard (1st tab) > Change Keyboard Type (button that launches Keyboard Setup Assistant). \n\n*If you don't see the Change Keyboard Type button, you can put this in Terminal: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist\n\n*insert admin password when prompted\n\n*then reboot and you should be able to see the button. You can alternatively try to replug the keyboard and Keyboard Setup Assistant should show up.\n\n\n\n\nIf that doesn't help, maybe you should try Karabiner. It has this EventViewer, that you could use to figure out what keys it thinks you are pressing and what they are outputting. If the keys really are not broken, you should be able to reassing them to output what you want using Karabiner. \nKarabiner has tons of presets for changing keys, but you can also use private.xml file to add your own key changes.\n\nA: If your main problem is making a tilde, a workaround for this is to switch to the US International PC layout and use Option - n plus space.\nOr you can switch to the British PC layout, where you make tilde via Shift \\ .\n", "Q: Automator use current directory location my goal is to use Automator to open an application with arguments\nopen ./MyApp.app -arguments\n\nvia running a shareable Buddy.app with Myapp.app (the Automator/workflow). both apps should be shareable together with anyone so they run straight off.\nthe simplest way to do so, seems to be to run the Buddy.app from within the same folder as MyApp.app.\nthen i can move the Buddy.app with MyApp.app anywhere, and they will still work together\nto set up the relative file locations in bash script,\nopen \"$(pwd)\"/myapp.app -arguments\n\nonly problem is that Automator uses the home directory instead of the application directory.\nie pwd is the home directory, and not the actual file location.\nin Automator the output from\necho $(pwd)\n\nis my home directory, /Users/User\nso the question is, how to get Automator (Buddy.app) to detect the current folder location and run MyApp.app ?\n\nA: Have your workflow figure out its own path (more robust)\nThis works as long as your Automator workflow lives in the same directory as MyApp.app; you can create copies of either the workflow or the app at your discretion and reuse those copies wherever you want; nothing needs to be unique.\nSteps\nThese are the steps to automate launching MyApp.app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the workflow in Automator.\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action. Remove all the boilerplate code inside and replace it with the following lines:\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \":\"\nset appPath to (text items 1 through -3 of (path to me as text) & {\"MyApp.app\"} as text)\ntell application \"Finder\" to open file appPath\n\n\n*Save the Automator workflow in the same folder as MyApp.app.\n\n*Run the Automator workflow; it should launch MyApp.app.\nExplanation\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \":\"\n\nThis means “Watch out, I’m going to split a string soon; and I want you to use the : character as the split boundaries.”\npath to me as text\n\nThis instructs the workflow to figure out the path to itself; path components are delimited by a colon (:), which is a remnant of Classic Mac OS.\ntext items 1 through -3 of […] & {\"MyApp.app\"}\n\nThis cuts off the last part of the path, and appends MyApp.app to the path.\n[…] as text\n\nThis pieces the path back together (again with : as a delimiter).\ntell application \"Finder\" to open file appPath\n\nLastly, this final line causes MyApp.app to launch.\n\nA: In Automator, create a workflow with Run Applescript first:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set p to path to me\n    return p\nend run\n\n.. and then chain it to a Run Shell Script that has Pass input: as arguments:\nAPP_PATH=$1\ncd \"$APP_PATH/Contents\"\n...\n\nSave it as an Application.\nHere's a screenshot where I use this to start SQLWorkbench/J:\n\n(SQLWOrkbench/J's zip file is unzipped into the resulting app's Contents folder)\n\nA: Use the target app’s bundle identifier (more flexible)\nDo you plan to keep only one single copy of MyApp.app on the entire system?\nIf so, you can take advantage of MyApp.app’s bundle identifier, and have Launch Services figure out all the nitty-gritty details for you.\nThis solution is rather flexible; it has the benefit that you can put your Automator workflow wherever you want – it does not have to be in the same location as MyApp.app, nor in any fixed location relative to it.\nSteps\nThese are the steps you want to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app and run the following command:\nosascript -e 'id of app \"'\"$(mdfind MyApp.app)\"'\"'\n\n\n*The previous step should have printed out one single line as a result. Note what that line says (e. g. com.example.MyApp).\n\n*Open your workflow in Automator.\n\n*Add a Run Shell Script action with the content:\nopen -b com.example.MyApp\n\n\n*Save the Automator workflow in any folder at your discretion – no need to put it in a fixed location relative to MyApp.app.\n\n*Run the Automator workflow; it should launch MyApp.app.\nExplanation\nLaunch services\nThis solution takes advantage of a part of macOS called Launch Services, which maintain a system-wide database of apps and their properties:\n\nWhenever a new application becomes known to the system (such as when the user drags it from an installation disk into the Applications folder), the application is registered with Launch Services, which copies the needed information about the application into its database. Launch Services can then use this information to determine the preferred application for opening a given document file or URL.\n\nThe plan\nThe piece of information we’re interested in is the bundle identifier, or bundle ID.\nAn App developer typically assigns to each of her or his apps a (hopefully) globally unique bundle ID. We can take advantage of this uniqueness if and only if there is no more then one single app with the same bundle ID on our whole system – and only one single copy of that app. No duplicates.\nFiguring out the path\nThe command\nmdfind MyApp.app\n\nis just a fancy way to run a Spotlight search as a one-time shortcut in order to figure out the app’s path as of right now. We need the path only once in order to extract the app’s bundle identifier.\nSpotlight will (hopefully) return with something like this:\n/Users/watermelon/foo/MyApp.app\n\nExtracting CFBundleIdentifier\nWrapping the app’s current path in the following AppleScript command:\nid of app \"/Users/watermelon/foo/MyApp.app\"\n\nis simply a convenient way to **extract the CFBundleIdentifier ** from the MyApp.app bundle.\n(You could have also looked up the bundle ID manually by right-clicking the app in Finder, choosing Show Package content, navigating to the Contents subfolder and opening Contents/Info.plist in TextEdit, search for the key that says CFBundleIdentifier and find its String value one line further down. I think this is tedious, therefore I always prefer to use the AppleScript/mdfind snippet.)\nLaunching an app by bundle ID\nFinally, let’s have a look at the command you’re actually going to use in your Automator workflow:\nopen -b com.example.MyApp\n\nThis command is just a technical way of saying “Hey macOS, you’re good friends with launchd, right? Can you have it launch this app for me? Oh btw, I never bothered to look up the full path to it. What I do know though is its CFBundleIdentifier, which is com.example.MyApp; just go ask Launch Services and they will figure out the path”.\n", "Q: Sync iOS device from terminal Since I work with Xcode and plug in and out iOS devices multiple times per day, I don't want iTunes to automatically backup them every time I plug them in.

According to Apples documentation:\n\nMacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2016) and late-2016 MacBook Pro models support 60Hz refresh rates over HDMI when used with a supported HDMI 2.0 display, an HDMI Premium Certified cable, and a supported USB-C to HDMI 2.0 adapter\n\nMy setup have all those things I still cannot run my monitor at 60hz (it runs at 30hz by default, and I can't change it anywhere). Is it supposed to work out of the box or am I missing some configuration?\nEDIT:\nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot in safe mode. This revealed the option to set the refresh rate, however only to 24hz, 28hz or 30hz. When booting normally this option was again not there.\n\n*Reset NVRAM. Did nothing.\n\n*Reset SMC. Did nothing.\n\n\nI'm not sure this is a duplicate question as suggested in the comments as this monitor supports HDMI 2.0. If the monitor for some other reason doesn't support the 2016 MBP I would be interested in knowing that.\nEDIT2:\n\n\nA: I didn't manage to solve the problem with the current setup. It seems like Apple still has some work to do regarding HDMI 2.0 @ 60hz. It simply doesn't work out of the box, at least not with this monitor.\nFor the sceptics:\n\n*\n\n*Safe mode reveals the option to change the refresh rate, but still doesn't allow more than 30hz.\n\n*Resetting NVRAM and/or SMC did not help.\n\n*I tried using another monitor (same brand), another late 2016 MBP, another Apple USB-C to HDMI adapter and several different HDMI cables.\n\nHowever:\nUsing a USB-C to Displayport cable immediately solved the problem. I used this one: https://store.google.com/product/usb_type_c_to_displayport_cable\n\nA: Since you can't see the Refresh Rate option in your display preferences, I would try booting into Safe Mode first to see if you can reset your display resolution to default settings. If that doesn't work, then I'd reset the NVRAM and SMC (in that order). See below for full steps for each.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps boot your MBP into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*The very act of starting in Safe Mode will perform a whole heap of functions (such as deleting a whole heap of cache files, verifying your startup disk, etc) so it will take longer to boot.\n\n*After booting into Safe Mode take note of your display preferences (i.e. do you see the Refresh Rate option, etc)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by rebooting your Mac as normal\n\n*After booting normally take note of your display preferences again\n\n\nIf this resolves the issue, no need to proceed. Otherwise proceed to resetting the NVRAM.\nResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). To reset the NVRAM on all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote 1: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nNote 2: These steps will also work to reset the NVRAM (or PRAM) for all Macs. However, the late-2016 MBP models actually required the commandoptionpr keys to be held down for 20 seconds, while earlier Macs did not require this, but doing so does not cause any problems either.\nIf this resolves the issue, no need to proceed. Otherwise proceed to resetting the SMC.\nResetting the SMC\nTo reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your model of MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button (or Touch ID button)\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n", "Q: Login user when connecting via ssh on MacOS I've added MacOS Sierra machine to a corporate Active Directory domain and have enabled the remote login for several users in an AD group.\nThose users can log in locally via UI and even can log in via opened SSH to mac.\nThe business requirement that this was done for is to allow users to connect to a Xamarin Build host from Visual Studio to develop for iOS, but this is outside of the scope of this question. So ultimately the connection from Visual Studio is done via pure SSH. Once the remote MacOS machine accepts the ssh credentials that are entered in VS UI, it tries to deploy a program part required by VS to perform needed tasks, a Broker application. The log of the attempt is the following:\nStarting connection to Mac mac.mydomain.net...

Not only does your setup likely violate the explicit terms relating to Remote Desktop functionality in the software license (assuming your company didn't negotiate a custom license agreement with Apple), many subsystems, tuning parameters and scripts are designed for one primary user at a time. \nLong term, you'll probably choose to re-architect your build toolset to set up some mix of:\n\n\n*\n\n*a continuous integration server that builds without GUI\n\n*Apple's server.app and leverage Xcode server service to handle logging in to the GUI so you don't need to script and automate the local windowed session for the shared build account \n\n*multiple Mac for each developer so they can build locally instead of remotely. \n\n\nTLDR; the system wasn't designed for 5 remote users - you'll experience oddities and issues if you run that way for long\n", "Q: Blinking screen on Macbook Air 2011 13\" I have some issue with my macbook air mid 2011 13\" One day screen start blinking and flickering.

Can one application (Viber) have such big impact to the graphics output and besides its own window affect the output of the whole screen?\nWith Skype video everything works fine.\n\nA: This sounds a lot like GPU driver issues or application issues where the developers of the fiber app can fix things. Tons of libraries make hardware assumptions and might need to be updated for the new Apple hardware and GPU. \nif this is something you can easily reproduce on new hardware, the chances of Apple or vibes fixing it are high. Unless you don't need the latest GPU and can exchange for the non touchbar Mac - I'd work with software side to get the bugs addressed even though that can be slow and frustrating and sometimes opaque as companies typically shield engineering staff from users with bugs to report. \n", "Q: How to lock Xcode files or make files expire after a time? I have a xcode swift project which I will be sending to someone. \nis there a way to make it locked with a licence key or time expiration so that they won't misuse my code?\n\nA: No - there is no provision for locking or expiration of files and Xcode is even designed to archive parts of builds so don't give your code to anyone you don't trust or can't realistically enforce violation of an agreement to not use/disclose your work. Also, macOS has time machine so there's that way to go back and look at files as they existed in the past. \nThe typical way to control this is to upload the program / results of a build to TestFlight for testing or valuation. Those apps generally expire after 60 days.

For that particular message I would only want it on my Mac.\nConversely, if someone sends me a text message to my cell phone, I only want that to show on my iPhone.  I got this part right by going into Messages preferences and deselecting my cell phone number.\nHowever, if I try to remove the email address from Messages on my iPhone I get the message that \"You will no longer be able to receive iMessages at _____ on any device\".  By device do they mean iPhone, iPad etc or does that include Macs?\n\nA: What's happening is iCloud is syncing your message settings across devices. You'll need separate accounts to accomplish this.\nYou will need to first remove this email from your AppleID (presuming it's an alternative email on your AppleID). \nCreate an iCloud account for your Mac using just your email and log into that on iMessage on your Mac. This way you have a totally disconnected account and changing the settings won't effect all of your iCloud-connected devices on your first account.\n", "Q: Macbook always at lowest brightness I have a Early 2011 Macbook pro.

Therefore, to fix it, I plugged it into my external monitor and readjusted the brightness from the System preferences. Nothing changed! \nIf I look closely at the screen, I can see that it's still working. I'm thinking (hoping?) it's just a bug. Any ideas on how to fix it?\n\nA: I agree with IconDaemon's comment, so don't think there's much help you're going to find here.\nHowever, one thing you could try is resetting your System Management Controller (SMC). Now, before doing this I should add that while resetting the SMC is usually a totally safe thing to do, you may get unwanted results in the case of liquid damage. So, if you have the option of using your MBP with an external display and keyboard, you may want to just opt for that.\nAnother thing you should do is ensure you have a good backup of your data. Not just because you should have a backup anyway, but also because of the liquid damage. Your MBP is at a much higher risk now of just one day not working anymore.\nIf you'd like to try the SMC reset, follow these steps for doing so on your model of MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nI'm assuming, of course, that the left shiftoption and control keys still work.\n", "Q: Can the onscreen iPad keyboard move the cursor? One of the oddities of the iPad is that when I activate the screen-based touch keyboard, there are no arrow keys. There are arrow keys on a physical Apple keyboard, but no arrow keys on the touchscreen keyboard. Am I missing something, or some shortcut?\nWithout arrow keys I end up fumbling around trying to touch with my finger the exact place in the text where the cursor should go, but since my finger is the diameter of 2.5 lines of text, this is a trial and error process.\n\nA: I'm not sure about arrow keys, but one thing that may help with getting the cursor placed is to tap and hold and a bubble will appear above your finger showing you where the cursor is, you can then drag that around until it is in the correct spot. It's a little bit better than trying to accurately tap to place the cursor.\n\nA: You can find 3rd party keyboards with arrow keys, e.g. ProType.\n\nA: If you use the GBoard keyboard, you can move the cursor left and right by pressing and sliding over the space bar. \nUnfortunately, I'm not aware of a feature in GBoard to move the cursor up and down. \n\nA: If you tap and hold with 2 fingers on the software keyboard it turns it into a touchpad-like view which you can drag around on to control the cursor.\n", "Q: Touch Bar no longer controls iTunes I installed the Google Play Music app on my Macbook (Sierra 10.12.4) then uninstalled it. Now my Touch Bar music controls no longer work with iTunes. How can I reset it?\n\nA: What does work is quitting iTunes and playing a video on YouTube via Safari. This kicks/resets the media controls, and re-opening iTunes now correctly binds to the media volume. \nThe problem is iTunes (exists on 12.7.1.14, running macOS 10.13.1). I've yet to find the root cause of this problem (either when a phone call comes in via Handoff or some other problem) underlying cause.\n\nA: The first thing I would do is reset your NVRAM.\nResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). To reset the NVRAM on all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nIf resetting the NVRAM doesn't resolve it, try resetting your SMC as well. \nResetting the SMC\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac\n\n*Unplug the power cable from your Mac\n\n*For 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the shiftcontroloption keys (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*After 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button \n\n*Plug in the power cable\n\n*Turn your Mac back on with the power button.\n\n\nLet me know how you go, as there are other things you can try. However, I've found that resetting the NVRAM and also the SMC will usually resolve unusual or random issues pertaining to the Touch Bar.\n--[EDIT]--\nThis edit adds further things to try in order to resolve this issue. However, since macOS 10.12.5 has just been released, I would update the OS prior to trying the following solutions.\nUse Terminal to kill the Control Strip\nThis is a straightforward way to manually reset the Control Strip. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Terminal app (by default located within the Utilities folder)\n\n*Enter the following command killall ControlStrip (or you can just copy and paste it in)\n\n*Press return\nThere is no need to restart the Mac after doing this.\nChange what the Touch Bar shows\nIn System Preferences you can change what the Touch Bar shows. I would change this, exit System Preferences, and then change it again (if necessary).\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Got to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on the Keyboard preference pane\n\n*Ensure the Keyboard tab is selected\n\n*Around the centre of the screen you'll see a Touch Bar shows drop-down list\n\n*Change the selection to Expanded Control Strip (if this is already selected, change it to App Controls with Control Strip)\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n*Test your Touch Bar music controls\n\n*If it doesn't work, repeat steps 1 to 5 and change the Touch Bar shows drop-down list selection back to the original selection and test again\n\n\nTroubleshooting steps\nIf all else fails, you can try these troubleshooting steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Function keys - Press the fn key and try using the F7, F8, and F9 keys respectively as your media control keys and see what happens.\n\n*Use another user account - Try using another user account temporarily to determine if the problem persists. If you don't have another user account, you can add one in System Preferences > Users & Groups. Once you've added it, log into it and see how your media controls work.\n\n*Safe Mode - Boot your MBP up in Safe Mode and try using the media controls keys. To do this, hold the shift key down as you boot up. This will take a little longer to boot as your Mac cleans caches, runs some diagnostics, etc. Once you've tested, exit Safe Mode by restarting your MBP and then test your media control keys again.\n\n\nOnce you've tried these troubleshooting steps, report back on what you found.\n\nA: Google Chrome is the issue for me. iTunes now works fine with the media controls (Mo Firouz's answer above got it working again with the Safari idea), and so does Safari and even Spotify. But the moment I open Chrome, the media button becomes unresponsive\nagain. \nTry quitting Chrome, and either use Safari to make it work again, or just restart (ensuring Chrome won't automatically open). \n\nA: Because you say that the rest of the bar works even in iTunes, I really think this is probably an iTunes issue. I would try & reinstall.\nTry to throw iTunes in the trash - if it doesn't let you (it probably won't) you'll have to change the permissions. Right click & select Get Info. Set everyone to 'read & write' under permissions & it away again, then go to the App Store and go to Software Update to install it again.\n\nA: Uninstalling iTunes and reinstalling did not fix the problem.\nResetting the NVRAM and/or SMC and changing the Touch Bar settings did not fix the problem.\nThe installation of iTunes 12.7 fixed the problem.\n\nA: This function is broken. \nDownload HIGH SIERRA MEDIA KEY ENABLER from http://milgra.com/high-sierra-media-key-enabler.html to fix it\n", "Q: Ransomeware v Time machine and iCloud Can time machine or iCloud backups overcome ransomeware encryption of your hard drive?\n\nA: Well, if your Time Machine or iCloud backup was done before some ransomeware encrypted your hard drive, and assuming that the ransomeware didn't also encrypt your backup, then yes, you can restore from backup once you got rid of the ransomeware (probably by restoring your Mac from scratch).\n\nA: Update: I've just answered the question that this is marked as a duplicate of, and will maintain that answer, rather than this one.\nProbably not.  \nRansomware will have a relatively hard time deleting or encrypting online Time Machine backups.  Even as root/superuser, it's hard to delete Time Machine backups:\nsudo rm /Volumes/BK1/Backups.backupdb/Orion/2017-03-18-184155/BOOT/var/du--sortedALLk.13224.bak\nPassword:\noverride rw-r--r--  root/wheel for /Volumes/BK1/Backups.backupdb/Orion/2017-03-18-184155/BOOT/var/du--sortedALLk.13224.bak? y\nrm: /Volumes/BK1/Backups.backupdb/Orion/2017-03-18-184155/BOOT/var/du--sortedALLk.13224.bak: Operation not permitted\n\nBut it's far from an insurmountable problem.  I think folks should assume that the additional step that the ransomware would have to go through (which I'm familiar with but choosing not to publicize - I'd rather not help script kiddies) to be able to delete or encrypt TM backups is something most Mac ransomware you're likely to become infected with will be programmed to take.\nTime Machine users are encouraged to allow backups to run often, which makes them vulnerable to ransomware.\nTherefore some backup drives should be connected less often and kept more secure - not fully accessible to the system - specifically to protect from ransomware.  \nTypically, victims realize they've been infected with ransomware only when the ransomware announces its presence.  So it's likely you won't be able to tell that the computer is infected with ransomware before it has a chance to encrypt the data on a frequently or continuously connected external drive. Assuming otherwise is far from a safe assumption. The ransomware threat makes better disaster preparedness, including having more numerous physical backups, more important.\n", "Q: How can airplane mode interfere with WiFi? I am in a hostel for the second night.  WiFi worked great yesterday.  Today, it asks for the password instead of remembering, but doesn't accept it.  Keeps asking.  I have airplane mode on to prevent cell usage but WiFi and Bluetooth on.  \nSo I turned off airplane mode and the WiFi immediately connected without asking for password.  (However, it later disappeared.)\n\nA: Airplane mode turns WiFi off\nFrom the Apple Support article\n\nWhen Airplane Mode is on, you'll see [an airplane icon] in the status bar of your screen or on your watch face.

Context:\nI have an AppleScript .scpt file that speaks the selected text in the System Voice. The selected text is copied to the clipboard, and then the text is spoken via the say command. The script is triggered by keystroke via FastScripts. \nBecause the macOS Text-to-Speech volume is too loud by default (and there is no global volume control for the Speech), I use AppleScript to set the volume as a fraction of the current volume. I learned how to achieve this from this post:\nHow to change volume of “say” in AppleScript?\nHere is the part of my code that is relevant to my question:\nset the clipboard to (\"[[volm 0.35]] \" & (the clipboard))\nset this_say_Pid to do shell script \"LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pbpaste -Prefer txt | say > /dev/null 2>&1 & echo $!\"\n\nThe above code speaks the clipboard text at a volume that is 35% of the current system volume, which is what I desire. (Yes, the audible Speech is really that loud by default.)\nThe code works well, except I've discovered a bug.\n\nHow to reproduce the bug:\nTo observe this bug, copy the following text to the clipboard, and then run the above code:\n\n \n- This is a test.\n\nThe problem-text is difficult to format in Markdown (which is what Stack Exchange uses) because 1) blank newlines are automatically removed, and 2) a hyphen-space combination is converted to a list bullet point. This is why the above text formatting looks wonky; I had to use a blockquote to get around issue one, and I had to add a code block to get around issue two.\nHere is the problem-text, literally spelled out in words (if you want to open a text file and recreate the text):\nnewline\nhyphen space Text\n\nMake sure that you include the blank newline when you copy the text onto the clipboard. Make sure that there is a space between the hyphen and the first word of the text. Otherwise, the bug will not surface.\nThe problem-text must be the very beginning of the clipboard text. That is, if the problem-text is in the middle or at the end of the clipboard text, the bug will not surface.\n\nAdditional ways to reproduce the bug:\nThe hyphen (-) can be substituted for an en dash (–) (⌥ option + -) or an em dash (—) (⌥ option + ⇧ shift + -), and the bug will still surface. As far as I have found in my tests, there are no other punctuation symbols that can be substituted for the hyphen that will trigger the bug.\n\nThere is another way to trigger the bug, which does not involve a hyphen or dash. If the text is preceded by at least 2 newline characters, the bug will surface.\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*If there is 1 newline character, the bug will not surface.\n\n*If there are 47 newline characters above the text, the bug will surface.\nWhether there are any spaces between the 2+ newline characters and the text does not matter; the bug surfaces either way.\n\nThe effect of the bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*When running the AppleScript code with the problem text on your clipboard, the volume is not decreased one bit; the clipboard will be spoken at the system volume level.\n\n*Also, there is a noticeable delay before the text is spoken.\n\nTo be clear, while the context of my question is an .scpt file, this is not technically an AppleScript bug. The bug exists when using say directly in Terminal.app. For example, type the following in Terminal to reproduce the bug:\nsay \"[[volm 0.35]]\n- This is a test.\"\n\n\nIs it possible to remedy this bug, so that, when the clipboard contents begin with any type of problem-text, my script remains sensitive to the custom volume, and a delay is not introduced?\n\nA: The best is to put '[[volm 0.35]] ' into the shell (not in the clipboard), like this:\nset this_say_Pid to do shell script \"say '[[volm 0.35]]\\\\ '$(LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pbpaste -Prefer txt) > /dev/null 2>&1 & echo $!\"\n\n\nOr, if you want to put \"[[volm 0.35]] \"  into the clipboard, use the single quotes, like this:\nset the clipboard to (\"'[[volm 0.35]] '\" & (the clipboard))\nset this_say_Pid to do shell script \"LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pbpaste -Prefer txt | say > /dev/null 2>&1 & echo $!\"\n\n\nA: Simply add a comma after the [[volm 0.35]] part of your shell script. A space after the comma is probably not required.\nset the clipboard to (\"[[volm 0.35]], \" & (\"\\n- This is a test.\"))\n\nThis also eliminates the second error (hyphen and text without separating space).\n", "Q: Stop opening Dictionary.app when three-finger-tapping non-text in Google Chrome I have \"Look up & data detectors\" set to three-finger tap in the Trackpad preference pane. This means that when I three-finger tap on a word, I get a dictionary tooltip/overlay like so:\n\nThis is something I use and want. However, there is also something I don't want. When I three-finger tap on something other than a word, like the blank background of a page, or a nonselectable word, Dictionary.app opens, like so:\n\nBizarrely, this Dictionary.app happens in Google Chrome, but not Preview or Finder, where three-finger tapping on a background does nothing, as expected.\nIs there a way to keep the dictionary lookup tooltips for words, but get rid of the Dictionary.app opening for non-words?\n\nA: In google chrome, you cannot change the functionality of the \"Look up & Data Detector\" three-finger tap. You can only turn it off completely. More information on the functionality below.\nThis functionality is called \"Look up & Data Detectors\" in your trackpad options. This can be turned on and off.\nThe reason this happens in Google Chrome but not other Apple applications is because it is an Apple functionality. For example, doing a three finger tap in Safari on a hyperlink will cause it to open up a smaller preview window of the page or other very detailed information that the OS can find if it was just a single word.\nHowever it won't do this in Google chrome. In chrome it'll only give a basic dictionary definition, or anything very basic about the word tapped on.\n", "Q: iCloud shows that it is full but I am 100% sure it is not My iCloud shows that storage is full. I have closed the photo Photo Stream that relates to iCloud and I've double checked the memory using on Pages, Numbers etc and there is not much in there:\n\nWhy is iCloud showing my storage as full? How do I check and/or fix this?\n\nA: Photo Stream has no impact on your iCloud storage. Additionally, iCloud storage is not just about your iCloud Drive - in addition to other data (e.g. Mail, Contacts, Notes, iCloud Photo Library, etc), your iCloud storage also includes any iOS backups you have enabled (i.e. from an iPod, iPhone and/or iPad).\nIf you have an iOS device, you can go to Settings > iCloud and check whether you have Backups enabled. While there you can also check what else is enabled.\nIn addition, you can also go to Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage and then tap on Manage Storage at the bottom of the iCloud list. This will give you a breakdown of your data usage.\n", "Q: macOS 10.12.4 keeps losing Wi-Fi connection I have a mid-2014 MBP Pro which I have updated to macOS 10.12.4. \nAfter running this update, the laptop refuses to connect to any Wi-Fi network. \nNeedless to say, every device on the network has been reset and they are all able to connect to the house Wi-Fi, with the exception of the MBP. The MBP can see all the wireless networks, but can't connect to any of them. It can also see the hotspot from my phone, but can't connect to it. \nDoes anyone know of a fix?\nUpdate: This is a bug in 10.12.4 \nI have reformatted the laptop, installed a fresh installation of 10.12.4. The bug is basically this, if the laptop goes to sleep, your ability to connect to a Wifi network is gone forever. \n\nA: I would totally remove your Wi-Fi service, restart, and add your Wi-Fi service back.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Network\n\n*Select the Wi-Fi service on the left-hand side\n\n*Click on the cog icon at bottom-left and select Make Service Inactive\n\n*Now delete the service by clicking on the minus sign (i.e. the - button) at left of the cog\n\n*Click on the Apply button\n\n*Exit Network preferences\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Network\n\n*Click on the plus sign (i.e. the + button) at left of the cog\n\n*In the pop-up window, ensure that Wi-Fi is selected from the drop-down menu\n\n*Click on the Create button\n\n*Make sure Wi-Fi is on and connected (it should remember your previous settings, but if not just re-add your Wi-Fi network again)\n\n\nLet me know if this resolves the issue.\nBoot into Safe Mode \nSince removing the Wi-Fi service etc didn't work, let's try booting your Mac into Safe Mode: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac \n\n*Restart your Mac \n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you \nhave FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice). \n\n*Test to see what happens\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal \n\n*Test again to see what happens\n\n\nNote, booting into Safe Mode will take longer than usual.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nOkay, time to test your hardware.

The app complains that there is no connection possible whether I check to use encryption or not. In the server logs I see that the iPad connects but does not issue a STARTTLS command.\nI found these questions 1, 2 that suggest that iOS does not support STARTTLS but this sounds quite unreasonable. So I would like to confirm that iOS does not support STARTTLS or that the error has to be found somewhere else. Other devices can connect without problems.\n\nA: The problem was not STARTTLS, I was able to verify that the mail app supports STARTTLS. My problem is that the iOS 9 mail app does only support old and insecure SSL/TLS protocol versions. Usage of these versions (TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, SSLv2 and SSLv3) is forbidden by my mail server for security reasons. Since the iOS 9 mail app only supports these insecure protocol versions no connection is possible.\nSee also 1 and 2.\n", "Q: Open CSV wtih Excel from Finder Is it possible to open a CSV file with Excel direct from Finder and have the data grouped into columns.

I'm trying to find the process that takes care of what applications are open. For example, an app I closed stills shows as open in Dock and Force Quit, so I want to kill/restart that process (which takes care of what processes are open). Logging out would solve it too, but I can't right now. Restarting Dock does not work.\nFor example, I'm 100% sure I have killed Safari, using kill -9, but it still shows up in the Dock and in Force Quit. The process is definitely killed, but the Dock and Force Quit haven't got that, because the process that lists which applications are open have frozen. I want to know the name of that process.\n\nA: The process which keeps track of all processes is launchd (PID 1) which is the first process launched when the OS starts. There is no standard way of killing it (technically speaking sending the TERM or KILL signal will not kill it), if you could it would immediately lead to a reboot.\nIf Finder still shows an application running despite it being killed, you can also try killall Finder in Terminal to restart Finder without reboot.\n", "Q: Are OS installations on a disk linked to a system? I have a MBP17 with an SSD (Sierra) which I want to switch with my husband's MBP13 for work related reasons.\nWould taking out the SSD (OS and files intact) from the MBP17 and placing it in the MBP13 without re-installing anything render any problems? Meaning is the harddrive linked to an installation in any way, leading me to have to re-install Mac on the SSD before I can use the MBP13?\nWould it matter that the MBP13 is still on El Capitan and the MBP17 on Sierra?\n\nA: This shouldn't be a problem. I have done similar things both with an external disk and an internal disk. The first boot may take a very long time, but it is working — leave it to do its thing. Of course, double check your backups before performing something like this.\n", "Q: Does USB-C to HDMI take more processing power than direct USB-C to DisplayPort? I have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Two USB-C ports). My company bought a USB-C to HDMI adapter to connect a screen that has both HDMI and DisplayPort.\nI'm having some issues unrelated to the question (I have to unplug and plug back the HDMI cable for it to work). So I was wondering... Would a USB-C to DisplayPort work better? not only in terms of getting rid of having the unplug/plug the HDMI cable but also in overall performance?\nHow does a USB-C to HDMI work vs USB-C to DisplayPort?\nFor instance, I know that if you plug this HDMI adapter to a 4K screen, this will run at 30Hz. On the other hand, when using a direct USB-C to DisplayPort cable, the same screen would run at 60Hz. Is this because of the limitations of HDMI itself? or is it because it requires significantly more power to run an HDMI adapter?\n(I'm more interested in the performance part and how the Displayport and HDMI connections are different, if any, than in the issue I'm having with my current adapter).\n\nA: Technically speaking, your Macbook has two Thunderbolt 3 ports.  From Apple.com:\n\nTwo Thunderbolt 3  (USB-C) ports  with support for:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Charging\n  \n*DisplayPort\n  \n*Thunderbolt (up to 40 Gbps)\n  \n*USB 3.1 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps)\n  \n\n\nSo, the adapters you have are actually Display Port to HDMI;  USB-C is just the physical port type.\nSo, the question is actually: \"Which would work better?  Display Port to HDMI or Display Port to Display Port?\"\nPersonally, I don't like converting signals from one to the next - I would go with a Display Port adapter and keep everything the same end-to-end.  The less you have to convert, the less overhead and the less compatibility issues.\n", "Q: Macbook to iPhone tether, hotspot or wifi If I am connected to wifi on my iPhone, and I turn on my personal hotspot, and then tether to my MacBook will my MacBook use the wifi that my iPhone is connected to or will it use my data via personal hotspot? MacBook is not connected to wifi, only the usb tether to the iPhone, which is connected to wifi.\n\nA: When using you iPhone as a hotspot, it will use your data plan. In the screenshots you see my iPhone connected to WiFi, and when a device is connected to it's hotspot, my iPhone will be disconnected from the WiFi.\niPhone connected to WiFi:\n\niPhone not connected to WiFi, but network still available\n\n", "Q: MacBook 4K/60Hz adapter is working directly, but not via USB-C hub I have the Apple MacBook 12\" (2016) 1,1GHz 256GB Silver and a 4K/60Hz monitor.\nI have tried this hardware to connect the displays at 4k/60Hz:\n\n\n*\n\n*Anker® Aluminium USB C Type C to HDMI Converter, Supports 4 K/60Hz to\nHDMI Converter \n\n*Kanaan USB-C HDMI Adapter | USB-C USB 3.1 Type-C to\nHDMI Adapter Converter\n\n\nThis works perfectly when the USB-C port is connected directly to my MacBook.\nI have only 1 USB-C port on my MacBook. \nWhen I add a Belkin USB-C hub or even try to use the USB-C port of the Apple Multi-AV adapter, both adapters don't work, they don't provide any video output.\nI have these USB-hubs/adapters:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adaptor \n\n*Belkin USB-C 4 Port Mini Port Expansion Hub\n\n\nAm I missing something here? In my ideal situation I'd like to be able to connect my 4k/60hz monitor, 1440p/60hz monitor and the charging cable at the same time, but the 1440p monitor isn't that important. I'd settle with both the 4k/60hz and charging cable at the same time.\n\nA: The reason that when you plug in your (known to be good/working) USB-C to HDMI video adapters into USB-C hubs is because the USB-C hubs don't pass the video signal that originates from the MacBook Thunderbolt port.\nIf you need a hub for connectivity and you want to have HDMI output, you either have to get a dock or a hub that specifically passes the video signals like the Anker Premium USB-C Hub with HDMI and Power Delivery.\nApple tried to make everything simpler with having one type of port, but (IMO) they made it more confusing.  A few things to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB-C is the physical port type.  USB 3.1 is the USB specification that sets the standard for how the port functions\n\n*Thunderbolt 3 is the actual port on your MacBook.  It just happens to use USB-C.  \n\n*Thunderbolt 3 has many functions built into one connector\n\n\n*\n\n*Video (HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2)\n\n*Power Delivery\n\n*USB (3.1 Gen 2)\n\n*PCIe (PCI Express 3.0)\n\n\n\nThat's just a quick summary;  for full details, see Thunderbolt 3.\nSo, just because an adapter \"says\" USB-C, dosen't mean it's going to carry all those signals/protocols.  USB-C is often gives the end user the perception that \"if it fits, it works.\"  Unfortunately, now you have to verify that that what you want to do is supported by the adapter.\n\nA: Yep - the USB-C port on the Macbook can't support 4k at 60Hz PLUS fast data transfer so all devices like the LG 4k monitor have USB 2 data speeds. If your main issue (like mine) is to display 4k at 60Hz while charging the Macbook the only adapter I've found that says it will do that is Hyperdrive's USB-C dock with Displayport because the USB sockets are USB 2 slow speeds only. I haven't got one yet so can't vouch for it but I've done a lot of research and it's the ONLY one that I've found that allows charging while displaying 4k at 60Hz on an external display (that isn't one of the few USB-C monitors).\n\nA: \nI have the Apple MacBook 12\" (2016) 1,1GHz 256GB Silver and a 4K/60Hz monitor.\nI have tried this hardware to connect the displays at 4k/60Hz:\n\nThat computer simply cannot support 4K @ 60 Hz.  It also cannot support more than one external display.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/SP741?locale=en_US\nUse your Apple AV multi-port adapter and be done.\n", "Q: `dd` never terminates on OS X Working on both Linux and OS X (10.10.5), I'm using the command line tool dd to copy the contents of a USB flash drive to and from a compressed archive. To create the archive, I use the following on an unmounted drive (on Linux the format is something like /dev/sdb; on OS X it's something like /dev/disk2):\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk1 bs=1m | gzip -c > disk.image.gz\n\nwhich copies the entire drive's contents, compresses it, and then writes it to disk.image.gz. To unpack the image into a new drive, I use:\ncat disk.image.gz | gunzip -c | sudo dd of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m\n\nwhich takes the compressed disk image, uncompresses it, and then writes it to the drive. (You can check the progress of either command by executing the following in a separate window on Linux:\nsudo killall -USR1 dd\n\nor on OS X:\nsudo killall -INFO dd\n\nwhich in both cases signals dd to output a couple of lines on the amount of data transferred.)\nBoth processes work well on Linux. However, although the reading and compression work well on OS X, the decompression and writing never terminates. dd keeps writing data and more data, even though the (decompressed) source file has ended, and the disk drive should be full. If I wait until more data has written than should fit on the flash drive, and then ^C to terminate the command, the resulting drive seems to mount and operate just fine. But, it worries me that the behavior isn't what I expect.\nAny idea why dd's writing never terminates, even though it is no longer receiving data?\n(BTW: if you're using this as instructions to burn your own disk drives, MAKE SURE you have the right device identifiers (e.g. the /dev/sdb or /dev/disk2 mentioned above). dd does exactly what you tell it to do, so if you get the wrong identifier and tell it to overwrite your boot drive, it'll happily do so. Look elsewhere on how to determine the right device.)\n\nA: This might not really answer the question, but might provide a solution.\nInstead of using dd which seems to behave oddly for you, just use cat or cp. At least on OS X, they work very well on block devices.\nSo:\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk1 bs=1m | gzip -c > disk.image.gz\n\nbecomes\nsudo cat /dev/disk1 | gzip -c > disk.image.gz\n\n\nIf you want the reverse, just redirect gunzip's output:\n\ncat disk.image.gz | gunzip -c | sudo dd of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m\n\nbecomes\ngunzip -c disk.image.gz | sudo tee /dev/disk1 > /dev/null\n\n\nIf you just want to copy a block device\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk1 of=disk.image bs=1m\n\nbecomes\nsudo cp /dev/disk1 disk.image\n\n\nIf you just want to copy an image to a block device (e.g. Raspbian to SD card)\nsudo dd if=disk.image of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m\n\nbecomes\nsudo cp disk.image /dev/disk1\n\nThis also prevents any hassle with block sizes.\n", "Q: How to stop Mail from automatic \"mark as read\" behavior? (in Sierra) I'm curious if there's a way to deactivate the feature/behavior in Mac Mail (Sierra) where mail is automatically marked as read when clicked (I want it to remain unread until I click otherwise). I know that I can use the \"Classic View\" to remove the preview feature, but that doesn't accomplish what I'm aiming for (I want the preview to remain active). And I know there used to be a plugin called TruePreview which offered this feature, but it's no longer available. Any ideas?\n\nA: \"Mail Act-On\" by SmallCubed has a feature to \"Do not mark message as read\". It currently costs $30 and that is a lot if that is the only feature you plan to use (it's main purpose is to help you create advanced mail processing rules).

I have a badge stuck on the app of 1 unread email even though when I actually go into the app, I have 10-15 unread emails, for which I did not receive a single notification.\nIn the settings, Gmail is allowed background refresh, all notifications and access is allowed to Gmail. I do not use the default Mail app, which is why I have turned email sync off and just left the calendar sync on. I have tried removing the app several times and reinstalling it to no avail.\nDoes anyone else experience this issue? Has anyone found a way to fix it? Any help is much appreciated.\n\nA: I reset my phone and set it up as a new phone. The issue is fixed and it seems like and app was blocking the google synchronization.\nMy suspicion is that it is purevpn and its profile that could be getting in the way.\n", "Q: Downloaded Songs/Music Videos Stopped Playing After iOS 10.3.1 Update After upgrading to iOS 10.3.1, my iPad Air 2 is no longer playing music videos (TV icon), which I downloaded using Syncios. I can see that the music videos are there on my device, but they won’t play.\n\nA: I have seen this problem mentioned with a few other third-party audio/video apps. The solution offered was to delete the local song, video or audiobook from your iPad, then re-download it. This is a bug caused by iOS 10.3.\n", "Q: Different keyboard mapping on external keyboard Currently I have a challenging keyboard setup. My MacBook Pro has a fr_FR (French AZERTY) keyboard, but the layout is currently set to fr_CA (Canadian QWERTY). Even if the keys are not labelled right, it works perfectly fine for me who's used to a French Canadian keyboard.\n\nNow, I recently bought an external Mac keyboard that turns out to be en_US (American QWERTY). I would like it to also have the fr_CA \"feel\", but it seems to behave differently – seems like it simply applies the locale from my physical keyboard without \"assigning\" the keys based on the different layout that en_US is compared to fr_FR.\nHow could I make sure that the location of the keys on the en_US honours the layout of a fr_CA, different from the physical fr_FR keyboard?\n\nA: At this time, macOS does not support having different layouts on internal and external keyboards. Source: Me. I've dug around on the System Preferences in macOS Big Sur (11.1).\nHowever, you may find value in Autokbisw, an \"automatic keyboard input source switcher\". Source: I heard about Autokbisw from https://superuser.com/a/1150616.\n\nA: The mapping of the input source you have selected in the \"flag\" menu should always apply to both the internal and external keyboards.  The standard US keyboard has one less key, so it will be slightly different:\n\nIf yours does not behave that way, something is wrong.  \n\nA: Go into Apple preferences, open Keyboard. Once your macbook has recognised your external keyboard it will not tell you again. There are two drop down menus from which you can add any nationality of keyboard on those menus. This choice will appear in between volume and battery icons, which drops down when clicked.\n", "Q: Airport Time Capsule port forward magic packet (Wake-on-LAN) I have an Airport Time Capsule connected to my internet service provider and a Linux server wired to one of the LAN ports on my airport. I want to be able to use the Wake-on-LAN feature to wake my Linux box from sleep/suspend from anywhere -- not just from my local network.\nFirst approach that partially works\nI've gone into Airport Utility and set up a stable IP based on the MAC address of my Linux box's Ethernet controller. I then set up port forwarding for magic packets on public UDP port 29999 to private port 9 and the 10.0.1.x address I assigned to my linux box.\nThis works from both outside and inside my network, but only for about 15 minutes after the linux box sleeps. After that I guess the Airport loses track of it and doesn't know where to route the packet.\nSecond approach that seems like it would work\nIf I forward the magic packet to the broadcast IP for my network, 10.0.1.255, then the box does wake even after a long time has passed...at least that works from my local network where I can tell the wake program on my Mac or WOL app on my phone which address to send the packet to.\nBut I can't test it from outside my network because the Airport Utility won't let me forward to .255.\nFix for this\nI found several posts (which I can't find again today) that say if you can't forward to the broadcast IP at 10.1.0.255 to set the subnet mask to 255.255.255.128 and then forward to 10.1.0.127, but Airport Utility doesn't have anywhere to set the subnet mask.\nI found another post yesterday (which I can't find today) which suggested exporting the Airport Utility configuration file and editing the subnet mask in there and reuploading. I did that, but it didn't work.\nTL;DR\nI need to port forward a Wake-on-LAN magic packet from the Internet, through my Airport Time Capsule to the broadcast IP of my private local network.\nThe broadcast address is 10.0.1.255, but Wake-on-LAN won't let me enter 255. \nHow can I wake my Linux box from the Internet? Is there a way to send the packet to the broadcast IP? Is there some other solution that changing the subnet mask?\nIs there some other solution that I should be thinking about?\n\nA: The configurability of the Apple routers is (for some advanced use cases like the one you describe) perhaps a bit lacking. I hope someone else can provide a definitive answer as to whether it will be possible to actually broadcast that WOL packet using only the router!\nI propose to you an alternative that is slightly more complex (and therefore not ideal), but to me feels like a robust approach that will work in all home network environments, so that you can avoid relying on any advanced capabilities of the network hardware. \nThe idea would be to set up a machine on the LAN (such as a $5 Raspberry Pi whose power draw will likely be comparable to that of your linux server in S3 suspend) that is always running and which you may access remotely. However this is done is entirely up to you, you may connect them via WiFi or Ethernet and with static or DHCP addressing, and this is what I mean by flexibility, you may have to do specific configuration to deal with the NAT traversal and security aspects. As it applies to your situation (similarly to you, I have an Apple router as well) you'd probably just assign this machine's MAC to a static IP and forward the ports needed for remote access, such as port 22 for SSH, port 3389 for Windows RDP, port 5900 for VNC, and that's about it. It's hard to beat something like using SSH with a private key for passwordless secure access. \nThe other piece that will be relevant is if you have residential service from your ISP, your router's IP will be dynamic, and a service should be set up to periodically check that this address has not changed. I implement this myself using a cronjob and a python script that sends emails to me, but you can readily find tools to handle that job. Indeed, this aspect of residential internet service is hard to address without a programmable client machine, although I'd imagine that highly configurable routers might offer equivalent functionality.\nOnce you set things up to allow you to reliably and securely access your machine from the wider internet, you can now use that to broadcast the WOL packet on the LAN, at which point you may connect to the woken-up host via the usual means (which may also require configuration). \nI just like this approach because it's so powerful and you can administer many more aspects of your home remotely once you have this kind of setup.\nI have more than enough raspberry pi's but I already have desktops (which happen to run Windows) that I keep running 24/7 at home, so when I need to send a WOL to my macbook (if it's at home, it will be sleeping) I can just use any of those machines to do the job since they're going to be up all the time.\nBut if you have a small and low power machine you can just set it and forget it on the network and it will just always be there for you, that peace of mind is really great.\n", "Q: With Latest MacBook Pro and Radeon 460 Graphics, How To Tell How Much Memory in Use? I've got the latest MacBook Pro with the touch bar.  4GB Graphics memory and I'm trying to figure out how much graphics memory is in use when I run certain apps.  I also run Parallels which dedicates part of that memory to itself so I want to make sure I don't starve it for my normal mac use.\nI can see in Activity monitor that what I'm running requires High Perf GPU but I can't tell how much memory is being used.\nWhere can I see that memory usage?\n\nA: I would recommend using iStat Menus.\nHere's a direct quote from their website:\n\nCPU & GPU\nRealtime CPU graphs and a list of the top 5 CPU resource hogs. CPU\n  usage can be tracked by individual cores or with all cores combined,\n  to save menubar space.\nPlus, GPU memory and processor usage on supported Macs, and the active\n  GPU can be shown in the menubar.\n\nIn addition to the above, iStat Menus monitors a whole range of things that you may find useful. \nYou can download it for a 14 day trial to test it out prior to purchase.\nNOTE: I have no affiliation whatsoever with iStat Menus.\n", "Q: Command Line - Enable Remote Login and Remote Management For my job, before I deploy a new Mac laptop, I need to enable these two settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences - Sharing - Remote Login.

It's ugly and I need it gone.\n\nA: First we'll look at what the command did. The echo part returned the value of the arguments to the standard output. In this case, it wrote cd plus the response of the command pwd which returns the current directory. The >> part of the command writes the output of the command before it (in this case, the result of echo) to a file. The file it wrote to was ~/.bash_profile, which is a file of commands to run when bash is invoked. In this case, when you start your terminal.\nTo fix it, you can simply remove the lines that the command added. To do so, you can use Nano, which comes with your computer. Run nano ~/.bash_profile in terminal, and then remove the lines that say cd /Users/Dakota/Documents/School/Spring. Save your changes by pressing ctrl + x, and then press enter. Now, when you open a terminal window, you shouldn't be seeing those lines of text :)\n", "Q: App Store download paused due to internet disconnection I tried to download Xcode from the Mac app store and the internet connection stopped at some point.

Well I recently updated macOS 10.12.3 to macOS 10.12.4, and while my audio issues were fixed (the machine would sometimes not start the audio daemon on boot and was thus left soundless.) I am now facing a much larger, much more annoying issue. After the post-update reboot I found that Night Shift was enabled, the entire screen was now encased in a yellowish haze. However as I said previously my model does not officially support Night Shift, so I could not disable it via settings. I have also tried manually creating a new colour profile to fix the tone, but setting the white space value to 9300+ created an equally annoying purple haze, and anything below was still too orange to use. What's worse is that the dock and menu bar are seemingly unaffected by the colouration issue, but every open window is.\\\nI am the kind of person who stays up through the night programming, and relying on a combination of the bright blue spectrum light from my TV and a copious amount of coffee to make it into the next day with no sleep, so as you might be able to imagine, aside from the fact that all of the colours simply look wrong, and generally washed out compared to what I've come to expect from macOS over the last many years, it also causes problems with my schedule.\nPerhaps the most annoying issue here however is that the Night Shift mode doesn't even turn off during the day, so the focused window is perpetually a dingy washed out yellowish colour compared to everything else. Night Shift is the kind of gimmick I could only see myself using in a very limited set of circumstances, but now I'm stuck with it 24/7 and It's making my Mac (previously my machine of choice for just about everything.) just about unusable.\nI need some way to control or disable Night Shift via the Terminal, because as was previously mentioned the settings tab doesn't exist for me. Any help is greatly appreciated, and please don't hesitate to provide a suggestion even if you aren't sure, because if this is anything like the No Audio Output Device Detected bug it's likely a lot of people will be having the issue in varying circumstances and will need a universal way to fix it.\nEDIT: It turns out the issue is not an incompatibility with my model, but the fact that I am exclusively using an external monitor, and cannot access the Night Shift preference pane as a result. If anyone knows how to trick the system into thinking an external monitor is the internal screen please let me know.\n\nA: There is also another method described here for making your Mac think that your external display is primary:\nFixing Night Shift incompatibility with external monitors\n\nA: You could try to patch CoreBrightness to pretend your Mac is supported, which should allow the preference pane access to the on/off switch.\n\nnm /S*/L*/PrivateFrameworks/CoreBrightness.framework/CoreBrightness|grep _ModelMinVersion\n000000000001d490 S _ModelMinVersion\n\n\nSee Supported Mac models for Night Shift in Sierra 10.12.4+ for more information and #comment-9146 for step by step instructions.\nNight Shift not disabling in the daytime is actually a bug I’m facing occasionally with my supported Mac — seems like a buggy implementation.\n\nA: FWIW, I had the same issue immediately upon upgrading to Sierra, and solved it by uninstalling the NVIDIA Web Driver (not the CUDA driver) as seen below.\nThis is on a 2014 MacBook Pro with the NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB graphics GPU.\n\n", "Q: I am trying to \"split text to column\" on a .csv file in pages I have one column that is asking for my customer's name, some of my customers put just one and others put several names (first, last, title, etc.) I am trying to change this column to split at the space. I found an answer on here that gave me the following formulas LEFT(C2, FIND(\" \",C2,)) and =RIGHT(B2, LEN(B2)−FIND(\" \", B2)) This is working for me BUT if there is no space (they only put their first name) then it won't split out to the first column making half my users not have a first name.\n\nA: In the event that the user inputs one name with no spaces, the formula in the OP could be wrapped in an IFERROR formula.\nIFERROR(TRIM(RIGHT(B2, LEN(B3)−FIND(\" \", B2,))),\"\")\n\nThe IFERROR statement returns simply and empty string \"\" if there are no spaces.  (No spaces returns an error because FIND() results in an error when it cannot find a space.) The formula returns the characters to the right of the space. If no spaces found, it simply returns the contents of B2. (Of course, there is no way for the computer to know if the single name entered is a first or last name, even tricky for humans.)\nSomething similar could be used to return the first name or just the name in the original string:\nIFERROR(TRIM(LEFT(B2,FIND(\" \", TRIM(B2)))),B2)\n\nThe only gotcha will be if there are several names.  But this is a good starting point. A useful resource is the Formulas and Functions Help for the Mac apps—Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and iBooks Author.  Look for Text Functions.  Good function combinations can give the desired result.  Work from the inside out.  For example, TRIM(B2) will remove all leading and trailing spaces. Then, FIND(\" \",TRIM(B2)) will look for the first space without having to worry if there was a leading space.  Hope this helps!\nExamples:\n\n", "Q: Can't switch on Wi Fi after internet sharing stops due to VPN dropout We use a VPN to get around geoblocking because we now live in a different country to our native homeland. We do this by using an iMac to connect to the internet via an ethernet cable. I then connect to the VPN service and share that connection with internet sharing from the iMac. How this works is I use internet sharing to share the VPN connection via the iMac's Wi Fi antenna.\nThis all works fine and has done for over a year. The only problem we've ever had is that the VPN connection does drop out sometimes. I'm used to this, and its always been a simple case of reconnecting to the VPN from the iMac and all is swell again.

Use spotlight to search for the apps you want to delete and see if you have multiple copies. \nWhen that's done, you need to rebuild your spotlight index. That feeds both spotlight search and the launchpad icon list. \n", "Q: Find emoji description on MacOS or iOS Someone sent me an emoji in a text on an iPhone. How can I lookup the \"description\" of what it represents using the native UI? \nIdeally I want to lookup the unicode name / description, but a data point will do. I'm interested in an answer for current versions of iOS and MacOS.\nOn MacOS it's fairly easy to extract the data point from the emoji by looking at the hex codes of the character, but that doesn't work on iOS.\nI know that I can find an emoji from a text description when sending a message. But I see no obvious way to \"reverse map\" the emoji when I receive one. \nFor reference I was sent this: ❤️ \n\nand want to know how I could send that \"left pointing finger\" myself.\n\nA: On iOS\nOn iOS (and watchOS) you can use the Workflow app (which incidentally Apple has just purchased). It's free and is a fantastic tool for many reasons.\nWithin the app, one of the included workflows is called Name That Emoji.

I am in need to clean up my outlook for mac 2016 and looking forward to an organized mailbox. But before that, I need to backup all my email database from outlook mac so that I don't lose any emails. The Outlook for mac export is taking a lot of time to export the mailboxes as they are quite large in number. Is there any other way around to backup the outlook for mac 2016?\n\nA: Let the export complete. The internal storage of mails in Outlook 2016 for Mac is a cached version for all imap / google accounts that changes internally from version to version. \nThe export yields a far more standard and stable data dump which serves the purpose of being importable at a later date. \nIf you have local folders - on my Mac then things are slightly more complicated. Perhaps that's part of the slower export?\n\nA: *\n\n*What exact Mac model do you have?\n\n*What exact Mac OS are you running?\n\n*For Outlook, do you have Office 2008, Office 2011, or Office 2016? I have used all 3, but am most familiar with Email cleaning for Outlook 2011 and (currently) Outlook 2016.\n\n*Have you ever done any disk cleanup/maintenance/repairs, from a software perspective?\n\n*Are you making backups to an external device? And if so, what software are you using for that?\nNow, regarding Outlook, I assume you have deleted Emails in the past. Also, you should consider deleting any you do not need. For Outlook 2011, there is a way to rebuild its database (ie, Identity \"file\") to permanently remove deleted Emails. (For Outlook 2016, the procedure is different).\nHere's a link for outook for mac 2016 database rebuild:\nhttps://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1274738-office-2016-for-mac-manual-database-identity-rebuild\nIf that also does not work then you can opt for third party apps, one which is making headlines now a days is mail backup x, check out one of the articles:http://www.mailbackupx.com/how-to-scenerios/how-to-backup-outlook-mac-mails-on-mac.html\nPlease note that all the third party apps are paid.

Not just within macOS and iOS, but also when using third party apps online?\nI've read some articles that suggest installing software on browsers, but that's only for computers. How can I protect my online activity from prying eyes regardless of whether it's in a browser or other app, or whether it's on a Mac or iDevice?\n\nA: Your question may be considered as too broad or primarily opinion-based, and because of that could be closed. Protecting privacy can mean so many things to different people, but since your question specifically talks about internet privacy and ISPs, I will attempt a factually based generic answer that will give you what you need.\nThe most obvious way to protect your internet privacy is to disguise your IP address (and therefore a whole heap of other information about you, including your browsing habits). And the best way to do this is to use a VPN service.\nA VPN (Virtual Private Network) is totally legal (although some people use them for illegal purposes).\nYou can use your search engine of choice to research VPNs and decide whether this is for you and, if so, which one best suits you in terms of location, price, your needs, etc). \nFor example, if you're a heavy torrent user, some VPNs won't be suitable. Likewise, if you're trying to bypass geolocation restrictions to access media content, some VPNs will work for that and others won't. Regardless of the VPN they will provide instructions on how to use them for each of your devices. \nOn the other hand, if all you're concerned about is masking your internet usage on Apple Macs, iPhones and iPads, you can just use software such as Tunnelbear. \nRegardless of the option you pick, a VPN basically disguises your location by making your IP address appear as though you are in another location (usually another country). And because all traffic is routed via the VPN, it doesn't matter whether you're just browsing the web, playing a game, or using any other app that sends/receives data online. All that traffic is routed via the VPN.\nNote: If you intend to use an Apple TV you will need to connect it to another device that is routing all traffic through the VPN, as an Apple TV won't connect directly to a VPN.\n", "Q: How do I set \"Show in finder\" to reveal location rather than open files (in default program)?

So in El Capitan (and probably earlier), I was able to go to Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup and copy that folder to an external hard drive, delete the old folder on my internal drive, and use terminal to create an alias folder of the one on my external hard drive to place where the folder went on my internal drive (ln -s /Volumes/INSERT HARD DRIVE NAME HERE/MobileSync/Backup ~/Library/Application\\ Support/MobileSync/Backup). The alias folder had the same name (\"Backup\") as the \"real\" one and so, as long as I had my external drive connected while I was trying to run iOS device backups, it worked. iOS device backups were saved to the external hard drive instead of internal SSD.\nHowever, in Sierra, this doesn't work. Even if I do it the other way of highlighting the \"Backup\" folder on the external drive, pressing ⌘-L, and manually moving the alias folder to where it would go on my internal drive, it still doesn't work. Everything in Finder looks just like it did in El Capitan, however I get \"iTunes could not backup the iPhone because an error occurred\" when I try to backup my iPhone.\nI am running the latest version of Sierra, the latest version of iTunes, and my iPhone is running the latest version of iOS. I've restarted both my Mac and iPhone and even tried backing-up a family member's iPhone, but to no avail.\n\nA: A slight correction in terminology may help. Theres no such thing as an alias folder at the Unix level, but what you are actually creating is a soft-link to a folder.\nDepending on how the target is specified ln may not complain if the folder still exists, but it will not overwrite it.

I originally wrote this as a guide for fixing a specific issue that occurred on builds of macOS shortly after Night Shift was introduced as a feature. The issue occurred because of a known glitch for handling enabling of Night Shift at installation time when  upgrading a <10.12.4 macOS installation to 10.12.4 - 10.13.6 builds. Specifically this issue only occurred for people who were not using either an Apple monitor or the one model of LG monitor Apple \"supported\" at that time. Coinciding with their statement that they would \"not support\" other models of monitor for external displays on Macs with embedded displays (due to the way display drivers were handled at the time this also effected all Hackintosh users), Apple included code in macOS that would detect a monitor's brand and model by EDID and disable the Night Shift pane in settings. This led to a situation where the upgrade would enable Night Shift and the user would be left unable to disable it. The topic of this post has nothing to do with damaged cables, improperly seated cables, or an attempt to get the equivalent of Night Shift functionality on non-Apple/LG external displays. It is not a general thread for Night Shift as a feature and is intended to act as a guide to fix a known technical issue/incompatibility in a specific combination of macOS builds and monitors. I humbly request that users stop filling up the answers thread and muddying the waters with unrelated answers to unrelated Night Shift issues. Thank you. -OP\nIf you use an external monitor for your Mac of any shape or size and recently updated to macOS Sierra 10.12.4, chances are you've had some trouble with Night Shift.\nCommon issues include:\n\n*\n\n*the inability to configure Night Shift from your external monitor\n\n*Night Shift being impossible to disable (as a result of the former)\n\n*a substantial loss of colour quality (as a result of both of the former happening at once on some connection or screen types, most commonly DVI-D to VGA, DisplayPort, and LCD screens of all kinds.)\n\nHow do you get past these issues? Is there a way to enable access to the Night Shift pane on any display?\n\nA: Unplug the cable and insert it again.\nIt works for me.\nUpdate for Catalina (macOS 10.15): For secondary monitors, you may have to unplug primary monitor, so that the secondary monitor is the primary monitor. (Doing this once should be enough)\nby @Michael_Scharf\n\nA: After trying above solutions without success, I found the \"true tone\" setting in \"display settings\" of \"system preferences\", unchecked it, and external monitor became normal white again. Just in case it may help someone. I have an LG 4k with a USB-C cable.\n\nA: Another option is to download Flux. It is an alternative to NightShift, and reliably works on both internal and external monitors. It acts as a replacement to NightShift, so should not be run together.\n\nA: For me the following worked:\n\n*\n\n*disable night shift\n\n*disconnect external display\n\n*reconnect external display\n\n*enable night shift\n\n\nA: After two days of searching, I've found a solution that allows users to get past the Night Shift incompatibility issues with external monitors. This solution helps to enable access to Night Shift on any display.\n\n*\n\n*Connect your external monitor, disable your internal monitor, and make sure your external monitor is set as the default.\n\n*Download required files. You will need two programs (and a third optional) to proceed. The first is FixEDID, which can be found here: FixEDID, the second is DarwinDumper and can be found here: DarwinDumper, and the final (optional) one is KextWizard, found here: KextWizard\n\n*Open FixEDID, wait for the fields to auto-load, and minimize FixEDID, do not close it.\n\n*Open DarwinDumper, click Deselect All, check the EDID box, and click Run. You will be prompted for your password, and the dump directory will auto-open when it is done. Close DarwinDumper, and copy EDID.bin to your desktop.\n\n*Unminimize FixEDID, click Open EDID Binary File, select your EDID.bin. Now in the drop down menu under that button choose the internal monitor for your model of Mac (this will usually be the first option), and click the Make button. You should have a few new files now, but you can ignore all of them except DisplayMergeNub.kext, which you will need.\n\n*(Kext Wizard Version) Open Kext Wizard, click the Installation tab, click Browse, choose DisplayMergeNub.kext, and click Install. You will be asked for your password. Once it has finished reboot your Mac.\n\n*(Manual Installation) Open Terminal.app and run the following command sudo mv $(whoami)/Desktop/DisplayMergeNub.kext /System/Library/Extensions/ && sudo reboot. You will be asked for your password, and your Mac will automatically reboot as soon as the operation finishes.\n\n*Upon rebooting you can go to Apple > About This Mac and under the Displays tab you will find your Mac now considers your external monitor to be your internal monitor, as a result Night Shift should not be auto enabled anymore, and you can now access the Night Shift preference pane from Settings.\n\nA Quick Note\nFor those who want to reverse this process so that your external monitor is no longer considered a built-in display by your Mac, you can simply run the command sudo rm /System/Library/Extensions/DisplayMergeNub.kext && sudo reboot.\nAs with the previous command this will ask for your password, and automatically reboot your Mac after the process is finished.\nUPDATE: 01/04/2019 As of later versions of macOS 10.13 and all versions of 10.14 external displays are being recognized natively when they are the only connected display. Thus this information should be considered deprecated except to those using a secondary external display, or those running macOS versions 10.12.4-10.13.4\n\nA: What worked for me was switching cables. At first I was using a USB-C to HDMI adapter. When I changed the plug to connect the monitor with my MacBook without the adapter it started to work without any issues.\n\nA: For me it works when I change the resolution (and change it back to the initial value afterwards again).\n\nA: I have multiple monitors and this happens sometimes, with one or more but not all monitors stuck in Night Shift.\nWhat worked today, inspired by earlier answers to this question: System Preferences → Displays → Arrangement, drag menu bar from one monitor to another to change primary display, then drag it back to restore things to how they were.\n\nA: I have 2 UHD 4K 27\" LG 27UD88-W USB-C monitors hooked up to my 2017 MacBook Pro w/ Touch Bar via a single Thunderbolt 3 cable. This is achieved by way of an Elgato Thunderbolt 3 dock. (The monitors did not have enough power for the laptop alone and wouldn't offer a reliable single-cable solution.)\nI initially had issues with one of the two monitors being recognized reliably.  It was always the one connected to the dock via USB-C. (The other connected via DisplayPort.) I figured this was probably some driver issue.\nI installed their DualController and OnScreenControl  Mac OS software. Both installers required a reboot. The reboot did seem to help. However, I'm not sure if it was the software, the reboot, or both that ultimately fixed my issue with Night Shift failing on both of the monitors. I had already rebooted the system after introducing the Elgato Dock the day before.\nThe moral being, I'd suggest seeking out any software packages offered by the monitor manufacturer just in case they bundle drivers with them.\n\nA: make sure to check your monitor display profile.\ndisplays > color > display profile\nin my case i found that the profile was stuck on a Flux scheme (i used this previously) and it seemed like night shift was not going away. once i selected my monitor's profile the issue went away\n\nA: if anyone is looking for a very simple solution...\nIt is not Night Shift, but...\nbrew install redshift\n\ndoes the job well enough (for me anyway on this 2011 MacMini 5,1 with macOS Mojave)\nnot sure how it does on dual monitors, however\n", "Q: Why is my mac replacing my name on all my email as \"Holiday In The United States\"?

The bad thing is this has been a bug (for want of a better word) that seems to appear from time to time and it's been around for way too long!\nThere is no single catch-all solution that works in all cases, so it's not so easy to provide a quick answer here. However, you may find the following online discussions useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*My gmail name comes up as Holidays in the United States\n\n*Why does my name say Holidays In United States\n\n*Mail changes my name to some odd contact or calendar group\n\nA: This has bothered me for years and I just fixed it.\nI went to https://contacts.google.com/search/holidays and there was the rogue contact entry.

My solution is slightly left field but has the advantage of being utterly reliable - rather than trying to rebuild OSX spotlight or force mail to reindex mail, I instead archive mail into EagleFiler (https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/).  EagleFiler maintains its own separate search index so is unaffected by system spotlight issues which I find difficult and time consuming to resolve.

This threw an error:\nAn error occurred. Unable to import the certificate.\nError: -26276\n\n, but still the certificate ended up being listed in Keychain Access. Next, opening Mail and creating a new Email I was able to use the certificate. I decided to delete the certificate from the Keychain and re-add it in order to resolve the error. Therefore I deleted all entries containing the name of the trusted source I have used for my certificate (I believe).\nNow adding the same certificate again, still an error appears but the then listed entry says: This certificate was signed by an unknown authority, and Mail doesn't let me use it anymore...\nI have also created and added a new certificate with the same authority leading to the same result.\nIs it even possible I have deleted the default trusted root certificates from inside Keychain Access, or why else can I not use the certificate anymore? Is there a way to reset or fix it?\n\nA: If you have in fact deleted a trusted root certificate, then you must\n\n\n*\n\n*add it again\n\n*trust it again\n\n\nIn order to trust the certificate, open it by double-clicking on it in the keychain, open the Trust section, then set When using this certificate: Always trust.  \nIn order to make Mail accept the newly trusted certificate, it may be necessary to quit and re-start Mail.\nIf all fails, you could re-install your macOS over the existing installation which will most probably restore all pre-installed root certificates again.\n\nA: \n\nTHIS IS JUST TEXT TO FULL FILL THE 30 CHARACHTER LIMIT. \n\nA: #when in doubt, delete#\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 1: Deep Breath.\n\n*Step 2: Open Keychain. You should have two sets of tabs, one at top, one at bottom. Select \"LOGIN\" on top and \"CERTIFICATE\" on the bottom. \n\n*Step 3: Sort this by last modified. It should be one or two lines, I want you to right click, services > Revoke. If you do not see a function like that in services, then head on over to GPGTOOLS DOT ORG. The forum limits my amount of links, sorry. Download GPG Suite Beta 3, its on the home page. Right click > Services > Revoke them. If you did it through Comodo previously, go to the email and click the revoke button there and enter the password to revoke it. \n\n*Step 4: After revoking, delete them. Right click and delete. It will give you prompts about it. Again, it should only be one or two lines, there may be other line items right above and below that may have your email, don't to those. Do it by Date. \n\n*Step 5: After you delete them from the keychain. Delete the .P7S files in the directory structure where you downloaded them and send them to the trashcan. Ok, everything should be cleared out. Just in case, select \"My Certificates\" now instead of \"Certificates\" and make sure you don't see it duplicated there and its officially gone. \n\n*Step 6: Head to COMODO website and start the process here. USE SAFARI on this one, dont use firefox like it says. I have included the link below here. Sign up for the free one, its super easy. \nhttps://www.comodo.com/home/email-security/free-email-certificate.php\n\n*Step 7: After downloading. Close that GPG software if you have it open. You will still get the error, just keep moving on though. Double click the .PZS file you see there. A screen will come up asking where to put it and will offer a drop box to select. Choose \"LOGIN\" and click okay. \n\n*Step 8: Open Keychain, if it isnt open after that import. Select the LOGIN keychain and \"Certificates\" on the bottom and you should see it there in the list. It should have a expander and it will expand with a key below it. Double click the key, not the certificate. If you click the certificate, the wrong dialog box will open. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 9: Now you will see another diologue box come up. Select the \"Access Control\" Tab at the top. Then click the \"+\" button and search for \"MAIL\" and select the program. Close the window, not keychain. Then close APPLE MAIL completely, then reopen it again. Compose a message and you should see the blue lock on the right, make sure the email is the correct one.\n\n\n-Step 10: If you still don't see the encryption in Apple mail, go back to keychain and click the \"login\" keychain at the top and \"KEY\" category at the bottom. There won't be a modified date next to it but check to see if you have the \"Key from Secure Comodo Com\" in there, one should be private the other shared. \n-Step 11: If its not there and still not working, in keychain, select \"Certificates\" again and right click on the one you just imported. Right click, select, NEW IDENTITY PREFERENCE, and type your email exactly how you have it in mail, select the certificate below that name. Close apple mail, reopen it and it should now work.

Since the C-Error 10.12.4 update, my Macbook Pro no longer allows me to set/save my Mouse Tracking Speed in the System Preferences and the mouse tracking speed is stuck on slowest speed.\nWhen I open System Preferences, the mouse tracking speed slider is on ‘Slow’.  For a moment after I pull the slider to a higher speed, the mouse speeds up but then immediately returns to the slowest speed, though the slider stays where I set it.\nThe slider stays at my setting until I exit the System Preferences, whilst the mouse moves as though it's set to the slowest speed.  When I return to the System Preferences, after closing it, the mouse tracking speed slider is back to the ‘Slow’ setting.\nMoving the slider again repeats what I described above.\nI have tried using defaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling 8 but that has no effect after logging out and back in.  Using defaults read -g -g com.apple.mouse.scaling returns 2 initially, and after I set the speed to fast, it shows 3 on subsequent reads.  I have also reset NVRAM but to no avail. However, resetting NVRAM had the, undesired, effect of wiping my UEFI boot settings and now I can't boot into my Ubuntu partition.

In order to do this by the method I am recommending, you must have been using time machine with a hard drive regularly backing up your computer or you have been using some other hard drive that has recently backed up your computer. I have a 2 TB Lacie hard drive and time machine backs up my Mac every day. \nReboot and immediately hold Command/R until a dialog box with four choices appears. Click the top choice, MacOS Utilities. You soon will see a list showing dates, times and operating systems. Pick the very last one that occurs just before the the first presence of 10.12.4. I did it today, April 8th, 2017 at 4:30 AM and picked something around 4:00 AM on April 7th, one day earlier. \nAfter you click continue, you will be asked if you really want to erase your hard drive. Click in the affirmative. What will happen is your entire hard drive will be erased and replaced with everything that was on your hard drive just before you upgraded to 10.12.4. If you have an important file that you have just written, I suggest printing it out. I printed out a page in notes. Upon the restoration, at first it was missing, but then was unexpectedly restored after all. The erasing and replacing took one hour. \nWhen done, a screen appears that includes an earth icon at the top with a field right below where you enter your administrator password. Then click the right arrow beside the field. Then some brief Mac setup tasks occur followed by the importing of all your email. You will immediately notice your mouse tracking normally.\n", "Q: Use the column order in Finder List view for all folders In my list view, I keep only four columns: Name, Date Modified, Size, Kind\n\nBy default, Kind is the last column. With a mouse/trackpad, I can finely rearrange its position where I like it: in the second column. The final result is: Name, Kind, Date Modified, Size.\nWhen I change folder though, the ‘Kind’ column comes back to the fourth position. Is there a way of keeping a default arrangement for columns in Finder List View?\n\nA: View → Show View Options (⌘J) and choose Use as Defaults. This uses the settings of your current Finder window as the defaults in the future.\nFor folders you've opened in the past, they will continue to open with the settings they had last. Each folder's settings are stored in a .DS_Store file in the folder. Remove the file from the folder and Finder will use the defaults next time (and recreate the .DS_Store file with the new settings).\n", "Q: Does iCloud Two-factor authentication send a code to the same device as a log in request? My Apple-ID (e.g., on https://appleid.apple.com/ ) is set up to require entry of a 6-digit code sent to my registered Apple products.\nThis code is being sent to the same device I'm currently requesting to log in. I feel this absolutely defeats the purpose of this 2-Factor Authentication: If a person knows my password, this person can receive the code on that device, and access my apple account without any problems.\nIs this a bug or can I set up / change how this security step works? \n\nA: This is how it works and isn't a bug.  It's two-factor authentication, not prevention.\nYes, it's being sent to that device but, as you mentioned, it's also being sent to all other devices signed-in with the same Apple ID.  This is meant to notify the user that a sign-in is being attempted.\nTo use your example, if you're trying to log into a Mac that means you're not currently logged-in.  In that case, the Mac will not get the code because it's only sent to devices that are logged-in with that ID.  Your Mac is not logged-in at that point. \nYou can prevent this in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*mark the browser/device as always trusted (which makes you less secure - the log in request won’t then broadcast to all your other devices)\n\n*remove that device from your trusted list - all sign in requests will require a different device to receive your 6 digit pin (further locking down that one device - at the expense of not being able to use it as an approved for your iCloud)\n\n\nIf you're already logged-in to your Mac and now you want to add a new device to iCloud, your Mac will get the code because it's a device logged-in with your Apple ID and you've previously 'trusted' that Mac.  So now, the code is alerting all your devices that a login attempt is currently being made.\nThis Apple 2FA page can provide additional info.\n\nA: It's not a bug.\nThere is a misconception in your question that leads you to believe that this is bug: You write that the 6-digit code is being sent to the device that you're trying to log in from. This is not the case.\nThe 6-digit codes are not sent to your trusted device (unless you have specifically requested for the 6-digit code to be sent by SMS text message). The 6-digit code is already there, in the sense that it is actually calculated on the device.\nThe only thing sent to your trusted device is a notification that someone is trying to login and an approximate geographical origin of that request.\nUsually you login from a trusted device such as for example logging in on the \"Apple Store\" app on a trusted iPhone. In this case, the 6-digit code is not requested. It is automatically calculated on the trusted iPhone and sent along with your password to the server for authentication.\nThe situation you're describing happens if you use a Mac that you have added as a trusted device (the computer itself) - and then try to login to an Apple service via a browser that is not trusted.\nA browser, such as for example Google Chrome, does not \"know\" that your computer is trusted, and does not have access to the data necessary to calculate the 6-digit code itself - the browser itself needs to be trusted for that to happen. Were the browser trusted, you would not see a request for you to enter a 6-digit code, it would be automatically transmitted.\nIn your case with an untrusted browser, you enter your password and a notification is sent to all your trusted devices. This includes your Mac (on an operating system level - not browser level). You then get a popup with the 6-digit code that is calculated on your device. You can enter this in the browser and optionally choose to trust the browser, so you do not have to do this again.\nThe reason why this is not a bug is that 2-factor authentication in this case means that the user authenticates by \"something you know\" and \"something you have\". In this case the \"something you know\" is the password and the \"something you have\" is the special trust-data that makes it possible to calculate the 6-digit code.\nThe user that is logged on to the Mac in this particular case obviously has both, and as such it is perfectly valid to authenticate them.\nHad an attacker tried to login to the web site with your password that they had stolen, they would have been stopped from authenticating because they do not know your 6-digit code.\nHad an attacker tried to login to the web site from your own computer having stolen your Apple-ID password - without being logged in as your user on the computer - they would have been stopped from authenticating because they do not know your 6-digit code. It is not sent to the computer, so they cannot just \"snoop\" it from network traffic.\nHad an attacker tried to login to the web site from your own computer having stolen your Apple-ID password - and they're already logged in with your user account on the computer - then this won't stop them. They already have access to the trusted data and they know your password. Even if the notification was not sent to this device, but only to your other devices, it wouldn't have helped anything - the attacker could just generate the 6-digit code themselves on the computer. The good thing though is that you get a warning on your other trusted devices that someone is trying to log in.\nTo conclude: This is not a bug - it doesn't reduce security. This is how 2FA systems are generally designed.\n\nA: Whether it is a bug is arguable.  It obviously reduces security.\nSuppose I'm a bad guy who sees an Apple device that the owner failed to log out of or lock.  I decide to see what I can get away with.  First thing I try gives me image A (A.jpg). Oh, cool, the owner's keychain will fill in the password for me\nTwo-factor authentication ON THE SAME DEVICE asks me to approve me (the bad guy) sign on to the device.  That's security?  (image B).  Convenient for the bad guy, who doesn't know where the other devices are.\nAgain, ON THE SAME DEVICE, I am asked to enter a verification code which I can easily do, because it is displayed for me ON THE SAME DEVICE.  (image C)\nBefore Apple introduced this design error (yes, my opinion, firmly held), I turned OFF 2FA because I was frequently locked out of my device when the other device was not available.  Unfortunately, sometime since, they decided (another error IMHO) that we are no longer allowed to turn it off.\n", "Q: How to reduce Safari/WebKit logging verbosity? I only recently updated to Sierra (10.12.4). Now when I use the Console program to view console messages, I see a massive amount of logging by WebKit, especially about \"Current memory footprint\":\n\nThis makes it very hard to use Console to view messages by any other application.  Is there any way to hide specific application messages in the new version of Console? Failing that, is there a way to make Safari stop logging this level of detail, or log them elsewhere?\n\nA: While the accepted answer probably represents the right thing to do, there’s another way to narrowly answer the question, i.e. how to reduce the logging verbosity of the WebKit subsystem (permanently):\nsudo log config --subsystem 'com.apple.WebKit' --mode \"level: error\"\n\nNow, only error-level messages should be logged.  (Caveat:  I haven't tested it.)\nBut I won't recommend this;  rather just filter for the messages you need.\n\nA: Select one of those \"com.apple.WebKit.WebContent\" entries and right-click. There are a few different options to help you hide these verbose WebKit entries. You can filter them out by process name, process ID, category, etc.\n\nSimilarly if you want to just focus on the output of one application, you could right-click on one of its entries and select \"Show Process 'com.mydomain.myapplication'\" to only see entries generated by that application.\n\nA: Also on the Console app under the Action menu item one can [un]tick the Include Info Messages and Include Debug Messages to change the level of information displayed.\n", "Q: Is it OK to put a sleeping MacBook pro (Mid 2015) in your backpack and carry around? Is it OK to put this MacBook Pro in my backpack to carry around?\n\nAppreciate hardware analysis.\n\nA: The mid-2015 model is only available with SSD. I.e. you do do not have a hard drive with moving parts to worry about.\nIt is therefore safe to carry the MacBook Pro in your backpack and carry it around.\nJust be sensible: don't drop the backpack, don't sit on it, etc.\n", "Q: WD Passport Ultra can't mount on Mac, flashing lights, but can be read on Windows. What is broken? Update:\nAfter about 3 weeks. I plugged in again into my MacBook and left it there. After more than an hour I came back and the drive showed up on my Mac again.  (So somehow the problem got fixed.)\nI ran First Aid on Mac's Disk Utility. It says the drive appears to be OK. So I don't know what fixed it exactly.\n\nProblem: \nWhen I plug my WD Passport Ultra 4TB external hard drive WDBBKD0040BBK-0A (with 2TB of family photos) into my MacBook Pro it has fast flashing of light and can't be mounted. It can be read on a Windows laptop (after Windows automatically fixed an error).  I tried opening up Disk Utility on my Mac, but it just spins forever trying to mount the external hard drive. Nothing ever shows up on Disk Utility.\nHow it broke:\nThe WD Passport Ultra was plugged into my MacBook on battery. I was not actively reading or writing to the external hard drive, but it did have a list of directories open (no individual photo files, but just the directory names).  The battery ran out. \nWhen I charged up my Mac again it says that the disk was not ejected properly. Ever since that my WD hard drive has the flashing problem and can't be mounted on my Mac.  I tried changing the Mac laptop, changing the USB cord, same problem.\nI then plugged in my WD hard drive to a Windows laptop. It says that it detected an error and had the option of automatically fixing it. I clicked \"Start\" and let it ran, but it didn't have a progress bar and just had a \"Cancel\" button. After running for 3-5 minutes, my mom came in and unplugged the external hard drive forcefully (I yelled at her for doing that). We tried plugging it into the Windows laptop again, and my files and photos could be read!!  But it still can't be read on Mac and has the flashing problem.\nWhy is it like this? What is broken?  How can I test what is broken?\nI'm asking because I have had accidentally unplugged other WD external hard drives without ejecting in the past while not writing data, like in this case, but the drives never broke. What is up in this case?\nI'm curious if this is something that happens a lot or if it's just a less durable hard drive I got. Because I'm at a point where WD's warranty can give me a new drive to replace it, or I can fix this drive myself.  (I have copied the photos out to a new drive on a Windows machine.)  Because if it is something that happens with the same frequency in all drives, shouldn't I just fix it?\nWhat is the best free software program on Windows that might potentially fix my problem?  Mac programs are good too if they can actually access it since my Mac can't even mount it.\n\nA: You can try the following solution.\nIn Terminal use the following commands:\ndiskutil list\n\nFind your WD HDD identifier.\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk*\ndiskutil eject /dev/disk*\n\nReplace * with your version\nAfter that, you should be able to mount the HDD successfully.\n\nA: This happens because OSX \"forces\" a disk check/repair in the background before mounting the drive (since it was ejected improperly), so it will simply appear to not be mounting until that completes.\nIt seems it was fixed for you when you let the check complete---\nA quick way to \"fix\" this is to manually force quit the fsck process from activity monitor.\n\nA: As you have backed up the photos on the windows machine, you should try to use disk utility to fix your drive. There might be a volume mounting error or a format error, which can be fixed by using a function in disk utility  called \"first aid\".\nOn your Mac, spotlight search for disk utility. It should show up. When it opens you should see a column on the left with all your disks listed there.\n\nAs you can see, this column has both internal and external drives listed there. Be extremely careful, do not tamper with the internal drives. Go over the list very carefully and select your external drive. It should be fairly obvious which one it is. In your case it should be labeled as something similar to WD passport ultra. If not, you can look at the storage capacity and check if it matches with your disk's (here, 4TB).\nNext you need to run first aid. A self explanatory button placed towards the start of the row on the top says first aid. Click and let the magic happen! If it doesn't start right away, you may have a different version of macOS. In the case of this, click on verify the disk. Next, click on repair.\nWhile doing this, please make sure no one yanks the cable out because that will be very, very bad.\nIf these situations occur:\n\n\n*\n\n*You see the outputThe volume \"diskname\" appears to be OK., but the problem still isn't fixed\n\n\nor\n\n\n*You see the output Scan complete. Problems were found, but Disk First Aid cannot repair them.\nthen you can try to install and use DiskWarrior or try other solutions given on this thread. You could also try reformatting the disk, the steps for which I can edit in later.\n@jksoegaard's method looks promising too.\nGood luck!\n\nA: At first i tried to run First Aid on Mac's Disk Utility. But it didn't work. I unplugged the WD external, shut down my macbook pro, restarted it again,ran First Aid on Mac's Disk Utility again and finally it worked! It took about 5-6 min and my hard drive showed again :)\n\nA: A good idea would be to run the disk check in Windows to completion.\nPlug in the drive, right click the drive in Explorer, select Properties, and then in the Tools tab you'll find \"Error-checking\". Click \"Check Now\" and let it scan the whole drive fixing any errors it finds.\n\nA: I tried all the above, stressed for one afternoon, and then, from disk utility, clicked on the blue eject button on the top of the dialog box. Didn't ejected, but when I clicked then on the unmount and mount button. It mounted and appeared in my finder! ouf!\n\nA: I had the same issue and went to the disc utility and did pretty much what Haroon, above, did-clicked on the eject button.  It said it could not eject because the files were being used, so I tried repair and it looked like everything was fine, so I hit eject again and it still wouldn't unmount.  I then went out of disc utility.  It still wasn't there in finder, but when I pulled out the USB and put it back in-there it was!!\n\nA: For Macs, if your External Hard Drive is not showing up in Disk Utility. And you have ruled out damaged drive and cable. The next step you should try is using Terminal.\nSearch Bar:  Terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Type diskutil list, press enter\n\n*Find the Name of your External Hard Drive, it should show up here if it is not damaged. \nThe External Hard Drive name is the next line under EFI EFI.  Example \"Productivity\", \"Universal\" etc.  \n\n*If name is Universal, Type diskutil mount Universal, press enter\n(instead of typing the name of the drive, you can also type in the identifier, eg. \"disk3s1, disk2s1, etc\")\nThe External Drive should show up on Finder or Desktop. Good Luck, hope that works for you.\n\nA: The same happened to me...\nHere's what fixed the problem for me...\nIt was ejected improperly because my Mac went to sleep mode or shut down because the battery drained, so it will simply appear to not be mounted until that completes.\n\nFor the fsck process to complete, it may take as the amount of time relevant to the memory stored on your Disk. Please connect your Disk\n  and allow it to sit for few minutes to hours.\nIt took me about 10-15 mins (My 1TB Disk was 250GB full and 750GB\n  empty)\n\nA quick way to \"fix\" this is to manually force quit the fsck process from activity monitor. (not recommended because you have to restore the disk [i think])\n", "Q: Could my spotlight search index have really been 2.5 GB on a 256 GB drive? I have a MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2012) with El Capitan 10.11.6 and a 256 GB SSHD. I was having fan/CPU usage issues with mds and using the lines in this answer turned it off and deleted the index.\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\n\nsudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/*\n\nIt's quiet now, and cool as a cucumber. But I was surprised to see 2.5 GB of hard drive space freed up at the moment I deleted the index.\nMy 256 GB drive is fairly full, so that's about 1%. Does that sound right? About 1% of the size of my stuff is used for indexing? Just curious.\nI have quite a mix of file types, years of photos, lots of text and pdf's for research, youtube downloads, python's numpy and other text and non-text data files... does it all somehow get indexed?  \nIs there some magic way to stop it from opening file types I'm not interested in indexing?\n\nThis is the \"before\" situation.

But you can exclude folders, by either adding .noindex to the folder name, or by going into System Preferences → Spotlight → Privacy. You may want to move all the files you don’t want indexed into such a location.\nAlso see How can I make spotlight ignore certain file types and directories?

I'm used to having Command-Left Arrow (⌘+←) and Command-Right Arrow (⌘+→) to switch between tabs, going to the previous and next tabs. I have configured these keys in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts for Safari.app.\nHowever, configuring these shortcuts only works sometimes in Safari 10.1 under macOS 10.12. The behavior is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*When pressed in a tab with an active text box, the caret moves to the beginning and end of the row instead\n\n*When pressed in a tab with history forwards or back, Safari goes forward or back in history instead\n\n*Only when pressed on a tab that doesn't have the two above conditions, Safari switches to the previous or next tab\n\n\nHow can I disable the two other behaviors or configure the keys correctly so that I can use ⌘+← and ⌘+→ as previous and next tab shortcuts?\n\nA: You can use Keyboard Maestro to overwrite that ambiguous behavior in Safari and map ⌘←/⌘→ to switch between tabs regardless of any context (text field, history availability), to make it work just like it does in Chrome.\nIt's a pretty straightforward macro like \"When ⌘← hotkey is pressed, execute “Previous Safari Tab” action\" in a macro folder limited to Safari. However, Keyboard Maestro is not free.\nMaybe you could also create a free Applescript service to run Window⟶Show Next Tab command (since this command ignores context, unlike the respective keyboard shortcut) and change system shortcut ⌘←/⌘→ to run that service instead (would like need to add Safari to Accessibility to allow a script manipulating menu items).\n", "Q: Cannot find Python.frameworks in OS Sierra I am trying to find Python.framework under ~/Library/Frameworks but it's not there.

But as of recent updates, it only focuses the URL bar.\nI have the search bar hidden... so this sort of makes sense. However when I want to search for something with periods in it, Firefox treats it as a URL. For example: document.getElementById().\nIs there a way to restore the old ⌘ cmd K functionality of opening a true search field?\n\nA: This seems to work, in that it allows you to search in the URL bar for things that Firefox interprets as URLs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Command+K\n\n*Enter document.getElementById()\n\n*Hit the TAB key (or the down key) once to change selection from http://document.getElementById() - Visit to document.getElementById() - Search with Google\n\n*Hit ENTER\n\n\nA: When searching from the URL bar, I prepend a space before search terms containing a ..

Run This script in terminal:\nfor f in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Mobile\\ Applications/*.ipa; do\n    (echo \"$f\" ; unzip -Z1 \"$f\" | egrep -i \".app/Info.plist$\" | \\\n        awk '{ print length($0) \" \" $0; }' | sort -n | cut -d ' ' -f 2- | head -n1 | \\\n        xargs -I file unzip -p \"$f\" file  | \\\n        plutil -p - | egrep -i \"\\\"MinimumOSVersion\\\"\" ) | \\\n        perl -e 'while (<>) { if (m!^/!) { chop; $fqn=$_; } if (m/\"(.+)\" => (\".+\")/) { $e{lc($1)}=$2; } } print \"\\\"${fqn}\\\",$e{\\\"minimumosversion\\\"}\\n\";'; \\\ndone\n\nIt will list apps like this:\n\"/Users/username/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/app1.ipa\",\"7.0\"\n\"/Users/username/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/app1.ipa\",\"8.0\"\n\"/Users/username/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/app3.ipa\",\"7.1\"\n...\n\nIf you want the output in a file you can save the script in a file (minimum.sh for example) then run this command in the terminal:\n$ sh minimum.sh > output.csv\n\nThen open output.csv with Apple Numbers and sort the table with second column. Minimum iOS versions required are now observable.\n", "Q: Screenshot go 'nowhere' after Dropbox installation I installed dropbox and now my screenshots go to dropbox, I tried disabling \"Share screenshots using dropbox\" but now screenshots don't go to the folder but also not to the clipboard\nHow can I store screenshots again?\n\nA: To check where screenshots are currently assigned, in Terminal type\ndefaults read com.apple.screencapture location\n\nBy default that would actually return no answer, as the line should only be written if you ever change it - so I'm assuming Dropbox did change it at some point.\nTo reset it to the default desktop location, type  \ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop\n\nfollowed by  \nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nThis should cover for  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   3  &  4  screenshots.

(The Mac already does this when the battery is at 100% to, well, have the battery stay healthy.)\n\nA: I still don't understand your question.\nYou want to plug it in but not charge the battery? Why?\nMy vague understanding about batteries speaking with hardware repair shops, etc. is that it's no longer truly worth worrying about. You charge when you can, you use the battery when you must. While plugged in, the battery charges until full and then stops charging. Presumably, at that point, it's using the power cord and not the battery.\nThe other thing that I seem to recall is that it's all about the charge cycles. You want to keep that number down. So, if you work from home one day, it would be better to leave it plugged in all day because that would only be one cycle (assuming you plugged it in first thing in the morning). If you plugged it in until it was charged, then unplugged it and used it until it was low on battery, then repeated, that would be 2, 3, or 4 charges during the day depending on how you use the computer.\nSo, what I've heard from people much more knowledgeable than I, is that the potential gains you might experience doing \"the right thing\" are not worth the effort required to realize those gains.\n", "Q: Size of /Users folder is way too low, where is my data? My client called me because she had spilled some water on her MacBook Pro Retina.\nWe did all the standard things: turned it off, unplugged it, turned it upside down, etc.\nShe brought it to me and I'm having a look. I have little faith that the keyboard/logic board will be ok, but I had no reason to believe the SSD would be a problem.\nI plugged the SSD into my external enclosure, attached it to my Mac and voilà! \"Macintosh HD\" (999.33 GB) appeared on my desktop. Yay! I open it up and I see this:\n\nBut....Users folder is only 32.2 MB?! This computer was in active use, so Family Photos, Mail, Documents, etc.\nSo, then I looked at the Get Info for the disk:\n\nThis makes no sense to me. Until now, my belief was that either the SSD would be unmountable or it would be 100% fine.\nThis is clearly somewhere in between.\nHas anyone else encountered this? If so, was anyone able to retrieve data?\n\nA: Finder is probably just counting the /Users/Shared folder or other public folders. You probably don't have permission to the folders containing data for the user, so even though the data is there, Finder can't enumerate it to calculate the size. All you need to do is navigate within the Users folder and give yourself permission to the inaccessible folders (e.g. Documents) with Get Info.\n", "Q: Is there a way to update the emoji font? As you probably know,  and Unicode keeps adding new emojis, but, if like me, you can't or you don't want to update to the latest version of macOS, you don't have those emojis. I know that there are several emojis fonts such as\n\n\n*\n\n*EmojiOne\n\n*Twitter Emoji (Twemoji)\nBut, I don't want to have this kind of library, I would like to have the \"real\" emojis from  (Yes, I ❤️ to use the Apple logo and emojis ).\nIs there a way to update the emoji list from the  emojis?\nThis is my question, I think it's technically possible, but I have no idea where to find those emojis and how to update them.\n\nA: You have to either obtain a copy of the newer Apple Color Emoji font from a newer OS version and install it in your machine, or manually edit the one you have using a font editor app which can handle this kind of font.  I think the second option is not very practical for most users in terms of the work and skills required.  \n\nA: If you're on El Capitan, it's quite easy. You need to temporarily disable SIP and copy the TTC file over to /System/Library/Fonts. You should turn SIP back on after you copy the font, since that imposes a security risk, since any app can have unlimited access to the /System folder once you grant it access to file system.\nYosemite and earlier are the easiest. All you need to do is copy the file to /Library/Fonts, and maybe reboot for the changes to fully take effect.\nCatalina is slightly different. Once you disable SIP, you need to remount the /System partition as Read/Write (again, another security risk) by typing sudo mount -uw / into the Terminal. Copy it to /System/Library/Fonts\nWith Big Sur, you can't replace the font. However, it's still possible to update the font. Simply install the font, and disable the preinstalled font through Font Book.\nMake a back up of the original font!\n\nA: The font file you need to use a more recent version of is /System/Library/Fonts/Apple Color Emoji.ttc and is about 135MB.\nThe High Sierra version of the file and the process to install it to /Library/Fonts can be found here:\nhttp://stephenradford.me/install-high-sierra-emoji-on-older-versions/\nNote that the Emoji & Symbol picker will not list the newer emoji added since your version of macOS. For that to work you would also need to update at least  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreEmoji.framework and maybe some other files.\n", "Q: Myth need to be solved: will the battery drain faster in places with poor wifi signals? Will an iPhone's battery drain faster in places with a poor wifi signal (or phone signal)? My bedroom is far from the wireless router, usually the signal is very weak and flickering, but I have to discover, that after waking up from sleep my battery lost around 25 % for 7-8 hours, while actually I don't do anything with my phone, but it takes more energy than average when idle. \nSomeone can explain this for me, is it true?\n\nA: This is not a straightforward Yes or No answer. Consider the following points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cell reception - Having poor mobile (or cell) reception will drain your battery faster than if you don't. This is because all mobile phones (iPhones included) check regularly to determine signal strength. When there is no signal, your iPhone will keep trying to find and connect to a signal and this will impact your battery. If you are ever anywhere for any period of time where you know you have no cell reception, best to go into Airplane mode (or, if you have Wi-Fi, go into Airplane mode and then just enable Wi-Fi).\n\n*Wi-Fi - In the scenario you describe (i.e. your iPhone sits idly while you sleep and is not being actively used), the impact of having a poor Wi-Fi signal will depend on how many background processes you have running that require an internet connection. One example, if Mail is set to fetch data every 15 mins then it will check for new mail 32 times during that 8hr period - this obviously requires a data connection and will use more battery power than if it's set to fetch mail hourly (i.e. 32 time v 8 times). However, unless you have a lot of apps trying to use the internet in the background while you sleep, a loss of 25% battery power is not expected.\n\n*Wi-Fi Assist - The other complicating factor (especially in your scenario) is Wi-Fi Assist. Assuming you have iOS 9 or later, your iPhone can use Wi-Fi Assist to automatically switch to your mobile (or cellular) data connection when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection. Wi-Fi Assist is designed so that your iPhone can stay connected online even when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection. You can see then how this complicates your question a little - if you're sleeping for 8hrs and your iPhone has a weak Wi-Fi signal while you have a whole heap of background processes still continuing, and if Wi-Fi Assist is enabled, then your battery will drain faster still.\n\n\nIn summary, how much the battery will drain is affected by the above factors and your individual usage (the Apps you use, what settings you have, the health of your battery, etc).\nDo your own Five Day Test\nYou can conduct a 5 day test to determine the answer to your question for your exact scenario. Your test would go along the following lines:\n\n\n*\n\n*Day 1 - all on - Fully charge your iPhone and unplug it from charge and leave it as you normally do for 8 hrs while you sleep. Take note of the remaining charge afterwards.\n\n*Day 2 - Wi-Fi only - Fully charge your iPhone and unplug it from charge. Put your phone into Airplane mode. Then, enable just your Wi-Fi and leave it for 8 hrs while you sleep. Take note of the remaining charge afterwards.\n\n*Day 3 - Cellular only - Fully charge your iPhone and unplug it from charge. Switch only your Wi-Fi off (but don't put your iPhone into Airplane mode). Leave it for 8 hrs while you sleep. Take note of the remaining charge afterwards.\n\n*Day 4 - all off - Fully charge your iPhone and unplug it from charge. Put your phone into Airplane mode and leave it that way (i.e. no Wi-Fi or anything - it's totally off). Leave it for 8 hrs while you sleep. Take note of the remaining charge afterwards.\n\n*Day 5 - all on with Wi-Fi Assist settings changed - This will almost be a repeat of Day 1. Fully charge your iPhone and unplug it from charge. Go to Settings > Mobile (or maybe Cellular in your case). This is the screen where you'll see Mobile Data etc. Now keep swiping up until you get to the very bottom of the screen. If Wi-Fi Assist is on, turn it off. If Wi-Fi Assist is off, turn it on. Exit Settings and leave your iPhone for 8 hrs while you sleep. Take note of the remaining charge afterwards.\n\n\nNOTE: You will need to ensure you have the exact same apps running for each night to improve the validity of your results!\nAfter doing the above tests you'll have your answer. You'll know how much your battery drains under various conditions for your own personal circumstances.\n\nA: Yes, it does drain faster in areas of poor reception. I work as an engineer with antennas and radio systems. When the phone is on its periodically listening for a tower and pinging to find a response. When there isn't one, some systems ramp up the power a bit and try again, and repeat till max output...and stay there if no answer. Others will increase 'ping' rates, also a power eater. \nOnce found, systems will usually throttle back to the least possible power to maintain the link as a battery saving strategy. In areas of poor or no reception, this doesn't happen. This is why a drive in a rural area with poor or no reception seems to drain the battery quicker even if you're not using it. \n", "Q: Safari and Firefox displaying different colors than Chrome On this website, the blue button has the defined color #1E9AE2.

When the game is running fairly CPU-intensively the wifi menu bar symbol turns to 'off' for a few seconds and then reconnects, hence booting me from the game.

Annoying and long.\nI tried to use some AppleScript code that checks that the script that wants to run is the one for today and today only (not for the days before etc.), but I could not find a way to discriminate between repeating events: they all have the same properties!\nAnyone has a way around? macOS 10.12.4\n\nA: You can store the date the script was last run and only run your script if the script hasn't already been run today:\nproperty prev_date : \"\"\nset curr_date to date string of (current date)\nif prev_date is not curr_date then\n  set prev_date to curr_date\n  -- your existing code here\nend if\n\n", "Q: When I try to open System Preferences from the dock it opens directly into the iCloud pane I would like to open directly to the System Preferences pane, but instead it diverts to the iCloud pane. I have tried deleting the Users>Library>Preferences>.com.apple.desktop.plist file, but this doesn't exist--instead I only see .com.apple.dock.plist. Will this do just as well to delete?\n\nA: Does System Preferences have a badge (red 1) on it? This might indicate that iCloud is prompting you to turn on two-factor authentication. If that is the case, go to System Preferences > iCloud > and where it says “Two-factor authentication” click Continue to the right of it and then select your preferences.\nFor screenshots of this process and more discussion of it, see Apple Discussions – “System Preferences Dock Icon has red circle with 1”.\n\n\n\nI would recommend doing research into two-factor authentication or two-step verification before turning it on. It is a high level of security that comes with greater responsibility for you to go through the steps to validate trusted devices – all of which use iCloud and need manual steps.\n", "Q: Updated iPhone asking for passcode I'm trying to update my sisters iPhone 5 to the new iOS update but it's asking for the passcode to do the update. We have tried the passcode to unlock the phone and all the other passcode she can remember but we're still unable to update. Last time we had to use iTunes and then reinstall everything but that took forever to do. Is there anyway of resetting it? I've tried checking the restrictions thing - it's already turned off as well.\n\nA: The only password that gets asked when updating directly on the phone is the password you need to unlock your phone (or need to enter after restarting your phone). If she doesn't remember any of them, you must fully restore the phone through iTunes.\n\nA: iPhone 5's are unable to receive iOS 10.3.2 and later. Apple dropped support for 32-bit devices with 10.3.2. Remembering the passcode is irrelevant here. I was wrong. 10.3.2 isn't out yet :P\nSee if this works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iTunes and plug in your sister's phone. (Optional but recommended in case anything goes wrong: make a backup of the phone)\n\n*When you see the summary of the phone, see if it says \"iPhone5,1\" or \"iPhone5,2\".\n\n*If it says \"iPhone5,1\" then download this. If it says \"iPhone5,2\" then download this. These are large, so it may take a while.\n\n*Go back to iTunes and shift (or option)-click on \"Check for Update...\" and select your downloaded IPSW.\n\n*Unlock the phone if it isn't already.\n\n*Wait for it to update!\nIf this doesn't work, then I don't know what to do.

Make sure you're using DHCP and no DNS servers are hard coded. Also make sure you don't have some kind of proxy software or VPN running on your computer.\nEdit: try connecting your phone via USB and choosing that connection when you turn on hotspot and see if it works\nEdit2: original poster posted a screenshot showing a hard coded DNS server. I recommend clicking on all hard coded DNS servers, clicking minus, and removing them.\nedit3: the other issue may not be the wifi, but the modem to your internet provider.\n\nA: Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open network preferences.\n\n*Select your WiFi card on the left.\n\n*Click \"Advanced\"\n\n*Click \"Proxies\" tab.\n5.Enable \"Automatic Proxy Configuration\"\n\n*Close Network Preferences\n\n*Quit Safari.\n\n*Reboot your Mac and try again.\n\n", "Q: Sierra update - wont recognise external soundcard Recently updated to Sierra 10.12.3 on my early '11 macbook pro.

How might I run 3+ versions of google chrome so I can log into to 3 different google accounts.\nMore specifically I am looking to have separate icons in the dock for the 3 separate running applications.\nHow might I run duplicate and or copy versions of the same application.  The following linked question on SuperUser by Mark works for a lot of applications but not for Google Chrome.\nIt appears the following might work link.\n\nA: Google Chrome Canary is a bleeding-edge version of Chrome which uses its own profile, so it can be run in parallel to a regular copy of Chrome. The Canary browser is the least tested version of Chrome in their development pipeline (Canary → dev → beta → stable), but contains the newest features. For this reason it may not always work as expected, or sometimes not at all. It receives updates every single day. This SO post describes it in more detail.\n\nA: I used to do that some years ago. Just tested it and it still works.\nAdd two different accounts \nSystem Preferences->Users&Groups\n+\nFull : Chrome1, Account : chrome1, Pass : password, Ver : password\n+\nFull : Chrome2, Account : chrome2, Pass : password, Ver : password\n\nOpen a Terminal (Applications->Utilities->Terminal) and launch Chrome under these accounts (Plus, launch one under the account you are logged in to get at total of 3)\nsudo -u chrome1 /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome\n\nOpen a new tab in Terminal cmdT and enter:\nsudo -u chrome2 /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome\n\nYou will have 3 separate \"Chrome\" icons in the Dock now. Now sign in separately into each Chrome. \nI recommend that you login once to these accounts using the GUI, otherwise you will get Keychain errors when you quit Chrome.\nTo put direct \"links\" to open these browsers into the Dock\nApplications->Automator\nFile->New\nIn the search field, enter \"script\", add a \"Run shell script\"\necho yourpassword | sudo -S -u chrome1 /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome\n\n(Change yourpassword of course)\nFile->Save->Applications->Chrome1.app\nClose Automator\nOpen /Applications in Finder\nDrag \"Chrome1\" to the Dock\nClick Chrome1 in the Dock\nHope this works for you as for me.\n\nA: Perhaps a relatively new feature in Chrome might do the trick, except you won't have two icons in the Dock, and only one instance of Chrome running:\n\nYou can have multiple user's accounts at the press of a button:\n\n\nA: I recommend Incognito Mode for a second instance of Chrome.\nFor Windows, create a desktop shortcut and use this line:\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\" -incognito\nFor macOS, use this method found here:\nHow do I open Google Chrome in Incognito mode by default\n\nA: It really depends on the application. More specifically, it depends on wether the application needs exclusive access to it's support files.\nIf all you want to do is use a second online user, you want a second browser, not specifically a second session of Chrome. Use Safari.\n\nA: You just need to create a different user data directory for each chrome instance. Something like this:\nalias chrome1='/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --user-data-dir=/Users/<USER>/chrome-config/chrome1 > /dev/null 2>&1 &'\nWhere you would create /Users/<USER>/chrome-config/chrome1 directory to keep config data for this instance.\n\nA: There are different ways to login as two users.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new desktop and open the Chrome again.\n\n*Add another person to your Chrome account. Go to Chrome > Settings > Add Person\n\n*Open a new Incognito window and sign in as someone else.\n\n\nA: One of the easiest solutions for me was to find a custom build of the browser. In Russia, those are Yandex Browser and Atom.\n\nA: You can run Google Chrome and Google's nightly developer build, Canary (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html), on the same machine at the same time.  \n", "Q: After the image has been saved, can I still edit text-boxes & shapes in Preview.app?

I'm looking at the /EFI partition, and it has 2 .scap file.\n/EFI/APPLE/FIRMWARE/MBP112_0138_B18_LOCKED.scap\nand\n/EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/Firmware.scap\nThey both have 2 files with GUID's that are present in the other, however the contents of each are different.\nThe file with the GUID C3E36D09-8294-4B97-A857-D5288FE33E28 in /EFI/APPLE/FIRMWARE/MBP112_0138_B18_LOCKED.scap contains the text $IBIOS$  MBP112 88Z 0138 B18 1610201654 Copyright (c) 2005-2016 Apple Inc. All rights reserved.\nHowever the file with the GUID C3E36D09-8294-4B97-A857-D5288FE33E28 in /EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/Firmware.scap contains the text N $IBIOS$ ROMEXT1 88Z 0002 B00 0710231738\nWhat is the Firmware.scap file, and how come when I delete it, nothing changes except that it boots faster?\n\nA: The file\n/EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/Firmware.scap\nis the EFI extension that shipped with the latest operating system installed on that disk. You can also find it at the following location when booting that macOS system:\n/usr/standalone/i386/Firmware.scap\nThis file contains EFI extensions that your Mac may need to boot, e.g. because it cannot boot from an APFS file system otherwise. Some Macs also require it as without that file they cannot boot from external drives or only from some kind of those. In some cases it must change the state of hardware at boot time otherwise the hardware will not work correctly or not work at all. It is even required in some cases to perform a recovery installation over the Internet or booting over a local network.\nIf you delete that file, your Mac may fail to boot macOS from that drive. Yet all of the above always only applies to the version of macOS that this file came from. So even if your Mac fails to boot that version of macOS without that file, it may still be able to correctly boot an older version from another partition or disk. And if your Mac is somewhat recent, it will also boot without that file as it already has (most or all of) those extensions embedded into its EEPROM firmware. The older your Mac is, the more likely it will depend on that file being present during boot.\nIn case you accidentally deleted it and this causes trouble, you can easily restore it as long as you still have a way to mount the EFI partition and copy the file there from another macOS installation. If you deleted it and there is no problem, the system will still restore it on certain occasions (not on every boot but on every system update for instance).\nThe file\n/EFI/APPLE/FIRMWARE/MBP112_0138_B18_LOCKED.scap\ncontains a copy of the latest EEPROM firmware update installed. When Apple ships an EEPROM update (as part of a system update or stand alone), it is copied to /EFI/APPLE/FIRMWARE/, an entry named efi-apple-recovery is written to NVRAM (run nvram efi-apple-recovery in Terminal to see the content of that entry) and on next boot, the system performs an EFI firmware update (writing the content of that file into the EEPROM).\nThe EEPROM part of EFI is the part that is loaded directly after boot. It's the part that needs to initialize hardware to the point it can detect keyboard keys pressed, display something on screen, and access the EFI partitions of detected drives. Thus it also contains a file system driver to read that EFI partition as only then it can actually load EFI extensions from there. This is the part of the EFI firmware that is always there and will stay there when your drive is swapped as it is directly \"burned\" into a chip.\nFor those who are not familiar with (U)EFI, think of it like this:\nThe EEPROM EFI part is what used to be the classical BIOS that gets your computer into a bootable state after power cycle. The extension EFI part on the EFI partition is like a boot loader, that takes over when booting the operating system supposed to start and it may contain any kind of additional hardware/filesystem support relevant to booting systems. Yet a dedicated complex boot loader isn't always needed. Also with the classical BIOS it wasn't always required to have a complex boot loader installed at all on your hard disk; sometimes the BIOS would just read the MBR (master boot record) to RAM and execute the code found in it and the system booted.\n\nA: I suspect the second file is a security update. The 1st one most certainly is a no-fly zone.\nHas to do with firmware I think.\nHowever, never ever mess with your (U)EFI partition, or you may have a very expensive Apple doorstop on your hands...\nWell, my own EFI partition is mounted here. You can mess around with it all you like on an external bootable USB stick.\nI'm doing this just to see if I'm able to run an unallowed version of OSX on a very old, already scrapped Mac Mini.\nOS bootloader seems to depend on (U)EFI, namely...\nRevive a broken bootloader/ EFI partition, and you may do wonders. I think.\nJust look at this:\nhttp://xpcboot.weebly.com\nHave fun, but don't break a working Mac...\n\nA: Mac OS X does not use the EFI (extended firmware interface) partition,  it can boot with an empty EFI partition.\nThe EFI partition is more or less a standard in the GUID partitioning scheme used by Mac OS X.  It is always the first partition in the device.\nThe EFI partition is used for booting other operating systems like Linux.  Linux people call it ESP like EFI system partition.\nAlso EFI and UEFI mean more or less the same thing.\nI believe that the EFI partition is used for firmware updates and this is consistent with the presence of Firmware.scap.\nA recent post on this\n", "Q: Simple image-editing program to add shapes/text to an image that are still editable after saving? If I add text boxes and shapes to an image using Preview.app, save that image, and then close the image window, the next time that I open the image in Preview, all additions are uneditable. Preview saves the edits directly to the image.\nI am looking for a basic program that can do the same thing as Preview.app (i.e., overlay shapes and text onto an image), except that I need the ability to edit or remove the new image elements later.\nAdobe Photoshop can accomplish this obviously, but I am looking for something more user-friendly and simple (à la Preview).\n\nA: All the software I would normally recommend are probably out of scope considering your comments about Adobe Photoshop, and the fact you're looking for something more user-friendly and simple.\nSince you just want to be able to annotate an image and then edit this again later, one option for this type of thing is to use MS PowerPoint (which you already have). \nI've shown many people over the years how they can use PowerPoint and most of them have been happy with the results, so give this a go before you dismiss it.\nUsing MS PowerPoint\nOne feature of MS PowerPoint 2011 and above is that you can group items on the slide and save them as a single image. So, you could do what you want as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the image into your PowerPoint slide.\n\n*Use shapes etc to draw arrows, lines, etc.\n\n*Use text boxes to add in your comments.\n\n*Format them as necessary (color, line weights, etc).\n\n*Select all items (i.e. the image and any shapes, etc.).\n\n*Right-mouse-click on your selection and go to Grouping > Group to group them together.\n\n*Right-mouse-click on the grouped items and select 'save as picture'.\n\n*Select from PNG, JPEG, GIF and BMP for the image format you want (you can also select PDF as an option).\n\n*Now also save your PowerPoint presentation.\n\n\nAnd there you go - you've got yourself an edited (annotated) image you can use that is separate from the original file, and if you save the PowerPoint slide you have a way of going back and editing it again.\nPowerPoint also gives you some pro editing features such as the ability to arrange items (e.g. Forwards, Backwards, Front, Back) as well as adding shadows, transparencies, etc. If you take the time to really get to know it, you'd be surprised what you can do.\nI hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of using your profile pic to do a quick edit with it in PowerPoint just to give you a taste of what's possible.\n\n\nA: You could press Pages or Keynote or PowerPoint into service but for layered document work on the Mac, my favorite apps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Acorn - http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\n\n*Pixelmator - http://www.pixelmator.com/mac/\nPixelmator seems to be more of a photoshop replacement (which you can rent monthly if you prefer that option) but both are awesome and fully Mac like. \n", "Q: SSH Client not working?

Lightspeed POS has Lightspeed Retail / Lightspeed Restaurant / Lightspeed Onsite /Lightspeed eCom - each of which has a couple of variants, each of which has dozens of versions.\nThe vendor made a script to make all the changes to your system, so with a product like this, the chances they have a specific uninstaller for your specific situation is highly likely.\n", "Q: Apps in Dock creating new icon I have just changed to Sierra - 10.12.4\nSome apps (e.g. Aquamacs, Moneywell) in the Dock when you start them do not get a mark saying they are running but create a new icon that represents the running instance. This icon seems to have as its app one under /private/var/folders but with the correct app name not one in /Applications\nWhy is this happening and how can I get things back to how previous OSX versions worked.\n\nA: The issue is caused by Gatekeeper. It uses \"path randomization\" to run applications, until the user moves the app in it's final destination (/Applications for example). This causes the app to be run from /private/var/.. and Dock treats this as a new app.\nTo remove the quarantine attribute execute (removes recursively com.apple.quarantine):\nsudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Application/SomeApp.app\nRecursion (the -r flag) may be needed for apps that contain helpers.\nTo list the current attributes for an app execute:\nsudo xattr /Application/SomeApp.app\nor \nls -l@d /Application/SomeApp.app\n\nSources:\nOn Gatekeeper and the Lifespan of Little Snitch Rules\n", "Q: iBooks library location incorrect The volume containing my user folder was unexpectedly ejected, now iBooks wants the library to be in \"Volume 1\" instead of \"Volume\".

It happens with random applications, not just Terminal.\n\nI found where Terminal through Finder (to make sure the app shows up with the proper icon in finder) and then I closed the open Terminal app and opened a new Terminal session by double-clicking through finder instead of using spotlight.\nNow I get the correct Icon:\n\nIf I get the \"generic\" Icon again, I'll come update.  If it works for 24 hours, I'll come back and post the answer.\n\nA: Upon re-reading your question after your edit I see you're comfortable with using Terminal, so I've added a second potential solution for this. You do not need to try these in any particular order - try one first and if the issue returns, then try the other. Option 1 sometimes only works temporarily, but Option 2 requires entering commands in Terminal.\nOption 1: Reset and restart the Dock\nOne remedy is to reset and restart the Dock. However, in doing so, you will need to re-add any non-default icons to your Dock. (I usually find it's a good opportunity for people to start afresh and only add things as they actually use them).\nSo, if your solution doesn't pan out, you can reset and restart the Dock as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder\n\n*Press and hold the option key down\n\n*Now go to the Go menu\n\n*Select the Library option to open the User's Library folder. You can let go of the option key now.\n\n*Go to the Preferences folder (i.e. within the Library folder)\n\n*Find and move the com.apple.dock.plist file to the Trash\n\n*Now open Terminal (usually located in Applications > Utilities)\n\n*Enter this command killall -KILL Dock\n\n*Press enter\nThis should resolve the issue - but remember you'll need to re-add some apps back to the Dock.\nOption 2: Reset icon cache\nIf the first solution above doesn't work (or it only works temporarily), you can try resetting the icon cache.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal (usually found in the Applications > Utilities folder)\n\n*Enter the following three commands, one at a time:\n\n\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ \\ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \\;\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ \\ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \\;\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store\nLet me know how you go.\n", "Q: Is there a way to download a setup file for macOS Sierra on Windows computer and then install later on my mac os For a long time I avoided upgrading to macOS Sierra, reason being my slow home internet connection. At my home, it predicts to take something like 1 day 2 hrs. \nOn the other hand, my workplace internet speed is very fast. So I was thinking of downloading the Sierra setup file at my workplace and then verifying the installation media (if there is a way for verifying mac os because Xcode does have a way of verifying) and install it on my MacBook Pro. Only problem being my workplace computers have Windows operating system. So is there a way to download the setup file for macOS on Windows? I tried searching on Developer downloads and Support downloads but the only thing  I could find there were just updates and no main setup file.\n\nA: There is probably no legal way to download macOS Sierra on a Windows PC. Non-legal ways (it depends on your country jurisdiction) are either macOS Sierra torrents or a macOS VM transferred to your PC (which requires some type 2 hypervisor like VMware Workstation or VirtualBox) to download the Sierra installer from within the macOS VM.\nBut: since you own a MacBook Pro, why don't you simply take it to your workplace and download macOS Sierra there?\n", "Q: How can I install all brew packages listed in a text file?

Will I be able to use this to install all the packages it lists in one command on the new machine?\n\nA: brew leaves > my_brew.txt\nxargs brew install < my_brew.txt\n\nUse xargs instead of a for loop to avoid IFS.\n\nA: You can do brew leaves > my_brews.txt and then on the new machine do\n for i in $(cat brew_leaves); do; brew install \"$i\"; done. You can use newlines where there are semicolons above. [assuming bash]\n\nA: MERM provided a working answer, but others may be interested in a solution that, while not included with Homebrew, is published by the same people. Homebrew bundle is a brew package that is designed for this purpose, also handling casks and, I think, Mac App Store apps (with the mas package).\n", "Q: What app is making my phone vibrate, without putting a corresponding notification up?

So, as a minimum, the commandspace keyboard shortcut will need to remain as is. \nThe question then becomes whether you can activate Spotlight via another keyboard shortcut, in addition to the default shortcut. This may be possible, particularly with an applescript that is run by an Automator Service (which in turn is activated by a keyboard shortcut). However, this will not be possible with the use of command (or any other modifier key) on its own, which leaves you with the option of investigating whether Karabiner Elements (or for users of an earlier macOS, Karabiner), can do the job.\n\nA: You can assign the left command key as a shorcut using the BetterTouchTool.\n\n", "Q: Mac laptop cannot connect to disk on Mac desktop I have two Macs, both running Mac OS Sierra.

I have Sharing turned on, both AFP and SMB, but I cannot connect via either. I've tried connecting to the desktop via smb://, smb://.local, and directly by its local IP address (and the same for afp://). ssh <hostname>.local works, so it's not a DNS resolution issue.\nThe specific error I get is:\n\nThe server may not exist or it is unavailable at this time. Check the server name or IP address, check your network connection, and then try again.\n\nEdit: I should mention that when I try to connect by selecting the machine through the Finder sidebar, it doesn't connect, and clicking \"Connect As\" fails before getting to the password screen.\n\nA: Make sure you have the user enabled in sharing (File sharing/options)\nThen try ssh localusername@hostname.local\n\nA: The problem is my fault; I'd set up File Sharing not only in Sharing preferences like normal, but also in the Server app, and I'd set an access restriction so that only clients with 172.16.*.* IP addresses could connect and my network is configured as a 192.168.*.* network.\n", "Q: Can not create a bootable drive / partition on iMac This is a very frustration issue and I am banging my head against the wall.\nI have an old iMac Intel 21.5\" EMC 2389 iMac I salvaged from my parents and the drive failed.

If I select the drive in Disk Utility and click the info button the drive is listed as bootable = no.\nSo the installer plugs away, installs the first wave of files then reboots expecting it to boot from the target but it can't so it goes back to the installer USB stick again.\n\nA: Why are you installing from  usb?\nI recently replaced a hard drive in a 2008 mbp with samsung 850 evo. Using Target Disk mode, connecting mpb to my imac via 1394b/tb, i used the online restore to write the install image to the mbp after using the same connection with DiskUtil to partition journaled mac format.\nDespite what the interweb blathering to the contrary claims this works as designed. \n", "Q: What should the permissions on the /EFI partition be?

I rescued an old Bondi Blue iMac and have plans to turn it into a terrarium.  I have all the internals taken out and I am left with just the plastic shell.  I would like to glue all the seams together so it will hold together tightly, but I am unsure what kind of plastic was used for the shell.  I understand that you need to match the adhesive to the exact type of plastic or it could form a weak bond or even melt the plastic. I've looked for the little recycling symbol, but I can't find one on it to rule out some classes of plastic.\nCould someone tell me what kind of plastic material was used or how to determine this?  \n\nA: I believe that the plastic casing is polyvinyl chloride (PVC) because of it's durability and physical characteristics.  However, I don't have access to that machine to do any definitive testing.  That said, with a small sample of the plastic, you can determine what type it is with some very simple tests you can do at home;  see below.\n(I don't believe it to be Lexan (acrylic plexiglass) due to how easily it scratches with a fingernail.)\n\nPersonal note:  Way back when, I worked for an electronics manufacturer that reverse engineered products to see how they could make them cheaper (they were based in the good ol' USA).  One of the engineers taught me how they identified certain materials like plastics.  I had to go look this up since it was so long ago I actually used this type of info.\nBasic Plastic Testing1\nThere is some basic tests you can do to plastics to identify the type of plastic material.  Basically, the test involves:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look:  Is it transparent, translucent or opaque?\n\n*Feel: Does it bend? Can it be scratched? What does the surface feel like?\n\n*Cut:  Does it cut easily? Are the edges smooth or jagged? Does it crumble or flake?\n\n*Float:  Does it float or sink? (Note: not applicable to expanded foam materials. Water should be around room temperature).\n\n*Burn:  What is the size and colour of the flame? Do molten drips fall from the sample and continue to burn? Does the sample self-extinguish? Is there any odour when the flame has been extinguished?\n\n\nLow density polyethylene (LDPE) \n\n\n*\n\n*Transparent only as thin film, translucent in thicker sections\n\n*Fairly flexible; soft, 'waxy' feel, easily scratched\n\n*Easily and smoothly cut\n\n*Floats\n\n*Not self-extinguishing; molten droplets which usually go out on reaching bench or floor; blue flame with yellow tip and little smoke, smell of burning candle/paraffin when flame is extinguished\n\n\nHigh density polyethylene (HDPE) \n\n\n*\n\n*Transparent only as thin film, translucent in thicker sections\n\n*Fairly stiff and hard, can be scratched by fingernail\n\n*Easily cut with smooth edges\n\n*Floats\n\n*Not self-extinguishing; molten droplets which usually go out on reaching bench or floor; blue flame with yellow tip and little smoke, smell of burning candle/paraffin when the flame is extinguished\n\n\nPolypropylene (PP) \n\n\n*\n\n*Transparent only as thin film, translucent in thicker sections\n\n*Stiff; hard, can be scratched by fingernail\n\n*Easily cut, fairly smooth edges, when cut with chisel leaves white mark\n\n*Floats\n\n*Not self-extinguishing; molten droplets which usually go out on reaching bench or floor; flame mainly yellow with a trace of clear blue at the bottom; smell of burning candle/diesel when flame is extinguished.\n\n\nPolyvinyl Chloride, Unplasticised (uPVC)\n\n\n*\n\n*Transparent (unless fillers or pigments have been added)\n\n*Stiff; hard\n\n*Fairly easy to cut, smooth edges\n\n*Sinks\n\n*Burns with difficulty, self-extinguishing; yellow flame, blue-green at bottom edges; unpleasant, acrid odour of hydrochloric acid.\n\n\n\n1 How, using simple manual tests, can I identify an unknown plastic material? \n", "Q: How to install a Canon MX860 on MacBook Pro running MacOS 10.12.4?

Keep in mind that this is for the main server.  You can set individual server names in the VirtualHost definitions\nFor instance, if you called the server - mywebser.local, that should be the ServerName.\nPersonally, what I like to do, even in a home setup is to have a main definition that goes nowhere  and is very restrictive and create virtual hosts in separate directories so each one can be referenced by a different hostname.\n\nA: As per message:\n\nSet the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message.\n\nyou need to find your httpd.conf Apache configuration file for example by this command:\napachectl -t -D DUMP_INCLUDES\n\nFor example: /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf.\nthen edit it and uncomment the line with ServerName (make sure it has the valid server name).

Usually I take photos with my iPhone. On my Mac I have a more extensive photo library, and the masters are referenced from an external hard drive. \niCloud Photo Library is enabled on my iPhone, but not my Mac, because I don't want all of the full-resolution DSLR photos on my Mac to fill up my iCloud space. However, now when I take photos with my iPhone, it seems the Mac doesn't download them because iCloud Photo Library is off.\nCan I somehow instruct my Mac to download photos & videos from iCloud, but not upload to it? (I see that Photo Stream is a separate option, but I believe it doesn't support videos. It might work to simply not open Photos while my external drive with the large library is connected, so it doesn't upload them, but continues to download in the background — but I'm not really sure that will work.)\n\nA: Photos on the Mac can have two libraries. You could declare a new library as the \"system\" library that syncs with iCloud to get a downloaded copy of those images. That is the best you can do if you don't want all the Mac photos to upload to iCloud (short of using another program than Photos app).\nIf that meets your needs, you could hold option (alt) when you start the app to create a new library and/or switch between libraries. As you correctly observe, everything in the system identified library syncs up to iCloud. This syncing happens both ways in the background whether photos app is running or not. \nI don't recommend two libraries in Photos for most people - multiple libraries sounds good to many, many people and after a while, the majority of them regret making two (or more) libraries. You could be the exception, but I'd consider trying to make one library work for you if at all possible. I'm quite pleased with letting iOS and my MacBook compress images as needed and my Mac Pro keep full size versions of everything. A 150 GB library takes about half that space on my devices that have less than 300 GB of storage and I've never once missed the quality of an image.\n", "Q: Forcefully un-suspend a Parallels VM without starting Parallels I recently updated to Mac OS X 10.12.5, which is a beta version as of right now, and Parallels Desktop has subsequently refused to start. It sits for a little bit with a spinner and then quietly dies. The log entries shown in Console.app for \"parallels\" are not helpful, so I decided to try using VMware Fusion instead. Unfortunately, the virtual machine that I want to import to VMware is suspended and VMware refuses to accept suspended VMs. So, I tried deleting the .mem file for the VM, but VMware still refused to open it. I deleted the suspended.png image for the VM and VMware got a little farther with it, allowing me to select my target location for the import, but it still just ended up saying \"This virtual machine can not be imported in Hybrid Shutdown state.\" I'm at a loss for how to import my VM to VMware since I can't shut it down via Parallels, since it won't open. Anyone know how to forcefully un-suspend a Parallels VM without starting Parallels?\n\nA: Check that you have option ShutdownReason\"0\" in config.pvs.\nI think you have \"2\". It works for me.\n", "Q: Homebrew installation requests to use my confidential keychain information. Should I allow it to do so? I was installing Homebrew on my MacBook Pro (as per the instructions on this page), when the following message popped up:\n\ngit-credential-osxkeychain wants to use your confidential information stored in \"github.com\" in your keychain.\n  The authenticity of \"git-credential-osxkeychain\" cannot be verified. Do you want to allow access to this item?\n  Always Allow | Deny | Allow\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it normal for this message to appear while installing Homebrew? Why does it need to use my keychain? What is it going to do with it?\n\n*Do I have to click 'Allow' for the installation to complete successfully? What will happen if I don't?\n\n*If the answer to the previous question is that I have to click 'Allow', what risks do I run doing so? Is there anything I can do to reduce the risks?\n\nmacOS Sierra version 10.12.4\n\nA: My answer to question 2 (\"Do I have to click 'Allow' for the installation to complete successfully? What will happen if I don't?\") is - click \"deny\" and see what happens. The worst that could happen is that you'll have to reinstall Homebrew.\nA wee bit of context from my experience in installing Homebrew: when I installed brew I didn't get this pop-up. However, after installing brew I set up a launchd job to brew update once an hour, and I ran into a daily limit which prevented hourly updates. Brew advised me the solution to this was to (a) create an account at Github, and (b) generate a token\nfor brew. My assumption is that you already have an account at Github, and that brew install is checking your keychain for a token. In my experience it's not needed for install, and you can generate a token later if you need one.\n\nA: The following helped:\nbrew untap homebrew/dupes\n\nYou can dig the output of:\nbrew update -dv\n\nto find the cause, the log flood will stop when the message box pops up.\nIt was asking for several other taps, but it was sufficient to untap and tap them again to finally get rid of the nasty popup.\n\nA: I think it's asking to get your GitHub password from the keychain. I changed it to use git over SSH instead of over HTTPS with this (dangerous!) sed command:\nsed -i '' -e 's$    url = https://github.com/$      url = git@github.com:$' /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/*/*/.git/config\n\nnow, because I have configured an SSH key for GitHub, it doesn't prompt me for my password.\nUnfortunately, brew doctor will complain about this change:\nWarning: Suspicious https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core git origin remote found.\nThe current git origin is:\n  git@github.com:Homebrew/homebrew-core\n\nWith a non-standard origin, Homebrew won't update properly.\nYou can solve this by setting the origin remote:\n  git -C \"/opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core\" remote set-url origin https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core\n\n", "Q: Bash Tab-Completion for OSX Specific commands I've been looking around and I can't seem to find a bash completion rule set for macOS specific utilities. (i.e. diskutil, kext(*whatever), networksetup, defaults, launchctl, etc.) comparable to tab-completion for git commands.\nSpecifically, I would like to have TAB print a list of the options for the tool.\nDoes that exist?\n\nA: If you use a package manager (Homebrew, MacPorts, etc) it's worth checking if it provides any - brew search completion returns launchctl-completion, for example, though the other tools you mention aren't listed. You don't mention tmutil, but if it's useful there's a completion for it here:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash \n### 補完関数。\n_tmutil(){\n  list=$( tmutil | /usr/bin/grep -v ^$ | /usr/bin/grep ^Usage | awk '{print $3}' )\n  COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W \"$list\" ${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}  ) ) \n}\ncomplete -F _tmutil tmutil\n\nThat might also be a good basis for hacking your own completions?\n", "Q: iPhone asks for Mac password (or Mac asks for iOS password) During iPhone update to iOS 10.3.1, I was asked for my password using the correct machine name for my Mac mini. To be clear, the request was not for my iCloud password, my actual local user account password for macOS. This can also happen in the other direction - setting up a Mac may ask for verification for you to enter your iPhone / iPad passcode (and not your iCloud password)\nI could not find any information about this kind of access. I was thinking it was security for iCloud and possibly related to two step authorization or two factor authorization. This is the first time I can think of that I entered a desktop password outside of that actual desktop.\nI don't have a screen shot but I recall an implication that some files in my Mac are encrypted and need my password. '... need to enter the password for .' \nAre there settings I can I control this assuming it's a legitimate part of iCloud setup process or iOS setup process?\n\nA: This is a legitimate security prompt to validate you know the passcode / pin / pass phrase on another iCloud validated device. The current passcode overview documentation is at:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204060\nI don’t think we can control how this works since Apple makes the code and policies on the back end.\nThe passcode works to validate shared Keychain items and link your devices and accounts together as well as ensure someone that has your phone and passcode but doesn’t know your Mac password can’t get at your secrets put into iCloud from your Mac.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/passwords-devices-iph82d6721b2/ios\n\nTo approve iCloud Keychain when you don’t have access to your other devices, follow the onscreen instructions to use your iCloud Security Code.\n\nI think of this as a for, of two factor where they use the device passcode as the second factor instead of you accepting the push notification to another device to authorize.\nWhen you reset all settings or restore a backup from iCloud (or set up a device as new), the Keychain / iCloud and local USB trust pairings are removed and you should be prompted to trust the Mac when it connects to your iPhone.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202778\nAfter the trust setting dialog pops up (if you are connected over USB), there is now a screen that asks you to enter your iCloud password to finish setting up the iOS device. I have not seen the follow on passcode/password page ever until today. In my case, it wanted the passcode on another iPad and not a Mac ( I have two iPads, an iPhone, Apple Watch, two Mac connected to my iCloud account as primary accounts / keychain sync enabled on all).\nEnter Passcode for Other iPad\n\nAccess to your account is protected by the passcode for \"iPad\". Your passcode is encrypted and cannot be read by Apple.\n\nIn my case, the iPad in question is named iPad Air 2 and there's a blue link with the text \"Forgot iPad Air 2 passcode?\" Tapping that lets me select another device to enter a passcode. I then selected my Mac Pro and the text changes to:\nEnter Mac Pro Password\n\nAccess to your account is protected by the password for \"Mike's Mac Pro\". Your passcode is encrypted and cannot be read by Apple.\n\nI do have two step authentication enabled for my iCloud account so this seems a legitimate change that Apple has implemented recently to secure backups and/or joining a \"new\" device or OS to the keychain syncing / trust chain.\nAfter entering the password, there was a long delay (the iPad screen went dark) and the next step was the iCloud Keychain dialog which also was slow to continue when I tapped that.\n\nA: I just went through this for the first time. To avoid entering the other device's password on the new iOS device, I followed this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the \"Forgot [other device] passcode?\" link.\n\n*After several confirmation dialogs, this should bring up up a list of other devices to choose from. \n\n*Tap the \"Forgot passcode for all devices\" link at the bottom of the list.\n\n*After additional confirmation dialogs, you should receive an alert on your other device(s) prompting you to approve the new device.\n\n*Follow the prompts on one of your other devices to authorize the new device.\n\nA: I had a similar password request and I have a screen shot.\n\nThis seems very strange to me. They could send me identification codes to all the devices but why do they ask for a password of a different device? Unless I see an official document by apple, I will not enter any passwords. I do not use icloud anyway.\nThis request comes without connecting to the mac.\nSo, here is the solution: Just press: \"I forgot the password\". The phone will warn you that all the top secret info in the cloud will be deleted. But if you do not have anything in the cloud you can safely ignore this. After this everything is fine. I think apple is a little bit confusing with asking for things it does not need (in cases of users that do not use icloud).\n", "Q: iCloud: How to rename a folder on macOS Sierra?

OpenSSL/0.9.8h \n\nThis is a very old (and unsupported) version of OpenSSL you are using here which has no support for modern protocols like TLS 1.2 and modern ECDHE ciphers. Chances are high that after the upgrade your server now requires such protocol and/or cipher and thus connecting with your old OpenSSL version will fail. \n\n* SSLv3, TLS handshake, Client hello (1):\n\nThis might also indicate that your client is trying to use SSL 3.0, which is usually disabled today because it is an insecure protocol. You might try to enforce to use TLS 1.0 (which is supported by OpenSSL 0.9.8) by using curl -1 or curl --tls1 in the hope that the server still supports TLS 1.0 and has ciphers configured to be usable by the old OpenSSL version.\n\nA: In order to re-enable TLSv1 (or other protocols), it is required to modify the proxy configuration in /Library/Server/Web/config/proxy/apache_serviceproxy.conf, adding the required protocol to the <VirtualHost *:443> section like so:\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n  ProxyPreserveHost On\n SetEnv proxy-chain-auth on\n RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto \"https\"\n RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port \"443\"\n RequestHeader unset Proxy early\n <IfModule mod_ssl.c>\n   SSLEngine On\n   SSLCertificateFile \"/etc/certificates/${CERT_ID}.cert.pem\"\n   SSLCertificateKeyFile \"/etc/certificates/${CERT_ID}.key.pem\"\n   SSLCertificateChainFile \"/etc/certificates/${CERT_ID}.chain.pem\"\n   SSLCipherSuite \"HIGH:MEDIUM:!MD5:!RC4:!3DES\"\n   SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1 +TLSv1.1 +TLSv1.2\n   SSLProxyEngine On\n   SSLProxyProtocol -all +TLSv1.2\n   SSLProxyCheckPeerCN off\n   SSLProxyCheckPeerName off\n </IfModule>\n [...]\n</VirtualHost>\n\nAccording to my tests, SSLProxyProtocol need not be modified. Also, changes in the other files mentioned in the question do not have an effect, so they need not be touched.\nCaveat: Upgrading your Server app will probably always overwrite /Library/Server/Web/config/proxy/apache_serviceproxy.conf. After an upgrade, you will have to reapply the modification.\n\nNote: I have tried to move the changes to a separate custom configuration file apache_serviceproxy_customsites_myserver.domain.conf, which should stop Server upgrades from reverting these modifications. In addition to that, the protocol change could be limited to a specific domain.

I'm usually good with noticing changes with audio in general. A few days ago, I've realized that sound was a bit like balanced to the right.

I tried deleting the site, then stopping and restarting the web server, and finally re-adding the site from scratch, but the warning continues to show up in the log.\nWhat is wrong and should I care?\n\nA: I was getting the same message. It turned out to be a VirtualHost definition that was missing a ServerName directive. In my case:\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n  ServerAlias hostname-old.domain\n  Redirect permanent / https://hostname-new.domain/\n</VirtualHost>\n\nWhich should have been:\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n  ServerName hostname-old.domain\n  Redirect permanent / https://hostname-new.domain/\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\nA: Check the configuration file of your website for \"SSLEngine off\". In my case, this setting had been changed by the upgrading process. Changing that line to \"SSLEngine on\" solved the issue.\n", "Q: Weird remotedesktop folder in usr/local - safe?

My disk space is full and keep getting alert message.\nWill it be possible to add an extra hard disk or change the hard disk by increasing the size on my macbook?\n\nA: Most probably yes. Almost all MacBooks, except for some newer ones, have upgradable storage. If you want to see if you can upgrade yours, I would look up your MacBook on EveryMac.com. It uses your serial number, which can be found by clicking the Apple logo on the left end of the menu bar, and selecting \"About This Mac\".\nOnce at EveryMac.com, scroll down to the Storage selection where it will specify if it can be upgraded.

My Mac was issued me by my company - could they block that feature?\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.5 Beta (16F43c)\n\nA: In case this is your company's computer, it could have been deactivated through a management software, like jamf:\nhttps://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/20997/disable-icloud-desktop-and-documents-in-sierra\n\nA: These ports need to be open on your company's firewall/security appliance to allow iCloud in general:\n\nTo allow iCloud to function, Apple has a list of ports which need to be allowed for iCloud to function on your client devices. The ports used by iCloud are:\nTCP 25\nTCP 80\nTCP 443\nTCP 587\nTCP 993\nTCP 5223\n\nSee this Meraki page for more details.

I don't like an unnecessary permanent open port from the Dymo Label Webservice when I use the Dymo Application every few weeks.\nIs it possible to remove the web service and still use the Application to print a label every now and then?\nAll I found on the web were instructions to remove the Dymo software completely, which is not my intention.\nI have installed the newest version 8.6.1 of the Dymo Label software.\n\nA: Turns out it's really easy. I got this from Dymo customer service:\nGo to: Macintosh HD/Library/LaunchAgents/ and remove the file called: com.dymo.dls.webservice.plist.\nThen restart. The local printer still works, and the online service is gone.\nI expect that if you do want to use the online service, just save that launch agent pref file somewhere else on your hard drive, and replace it in the LaunchAgents folder when you want to reactivate it.\n\nA: Method 1: Unload Launch Agent.\nThe Dymo Label Webservice is started by a launch agent while booting (or better: logging in with a user). You should be able to simply unload the related launch agent:\nsudo launchctl list | grep dymo #check if agent com.dymo.dls.webservice is loaded\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.dymo.dls.webservice.plist\n\nYou may have to use the force switch: ... unload -w ....\nMethod 2: Set RunAtLoad to false.\nIf you are not successful you can try to change the RunAtLoad key in /Library/LaunchAgents/com.dymo.dls.webservice.plist with \nsudo nano /Library/LaunchAgents/com.dymo.dls.webservice.plist\nfrom\n<key>RunAtLoad</key>\n<true/>\n\nto\n<key>RunAtLoad</key>\n<false/>\n\n\nReboot and check if your Dymo label printer also works without the open port of the webservice.\n\nA: Just delete it, or block the port using a firewall and see if it still prints for you. If not you might have to reinstall the application (or stop blocking the port) to get it working again.\nI use Little Snitch as an easy way to block particular connections. Someone smarter than me could probably tell you how to configure the built in firewall to block the connection for free, but you could use the free trial of Little Snitch to at least see if the software keeps working when you keep it from phoning home. \n\nA: Download the Dymo installer from\nhttp://download.dymo.com/dymo/Software/Mac/DLS8Setup.8.7.3.dmg\n\n\n*\n\n*Run it.\n\n*After the accept license step you will be on the Installation Type page, click Customize.\n\n*Check the box to uninstall and uncheck the box to update the Web Service.\n\n*Run the rest of the installer.\n\n*When it completes run the installer again.\n\n*This time on the Customize page uncheck the box to update the Web Service and complete the installation.  \n\n\nA: Open your startup options and disable it from Startup. \n", "Q: Can I configure Mission Control so any space can be summoned on any monitor? I'm new to Mac and trying to get dual display spaces to behave like my previous system. \nIt seems like my choices are to have up to ten dual display spaces. Or I can separate the spaces, and get five on each screen. \nI'd like to have ten independent spaces that aren't bound to a particular screen. e.g. Spotify usually lives on the right because it's secondary but I like to glance at it. If I'm working on a playlist, I'd like to bring its space to the left monitor. Can I do this without moving spotify to a different space?\n\nA: System Preferences → Mission Control and enable Displays have separate Spaces.\n\nMission Control will show different Spaces on each monitor. To move a space between monitors with this enabled, open Mission Control and drag the space to your desired monitor.\n", "Q: External Drive With Every Version of OS X/macOS Is it possible to install every version of OS X / macOS to a bootable thumb drive/external hard drive so you can boot off of it?\nedit: so I'm ignoring PowerPC stuff because it is rather old now.  Also my main question wonders if the max number of partitions could be an issue.\n\nA: No. Newer os want GUID partition scheme. Others want apple partition map. \nYou can surely put all the images on one drive, just the bootable aspect is problematic. \n", "Q: Apple Music - The code you entered is not valid My father created a family membership for apple music, and I created an apple account (icloud.com) for that purpose (I'm in the family group).\nI'm trying to login from the Apple Music Android app, and keep getting The code you entered is not valid. Try again. in the account review part.\nWhat should I do to set it up correctly? It's a new account, I've never used Apple services before and I also don't have any products except this membership. Should I login to an Apple device, download iTunes for my PC, or anything else? What am I missing?\n2018 Update: After more than a year, I still haven't got a response from the customer support. It won't happen ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \n\nA: An Apple Music Family Membership requires iCloud Family Sharing to be set up.\nAccording to Apple:\n\nFamily Sharing requires a personal Apple ID signed in to iCloud and iTunes. Music, movies, TV shows and books can be downloaded on up to 10 devices per account, five of which can be computers. iOS 8 or later and OS X Yosemite or later are required to set up or join a Family Sharing group, and are recommended for full functionality. Not all content is eligible for Family Sharing. Content can be hidden by family members; hidden content is not available for download. Content downloaded from family members or acquired via redemption codes is not subject to Ask to Buy.\niCloud requires iOS 5 or later on iPhone 3Gs or later, iPod touch (3rd\n  generation or later), iPad Pro, iPad Air or later, iPad or later, or\n  iPad mini or later; a Mac computer with OS X Lion 10.7.5 or later; or\n  a PC with Windows 7 or Windows 8 (Outlook 2007 or later or an\n  up-to-date browser is required for accessing email, contacts and\n  calendars). Some features require iOS 10 and macOS Sierra. Some\n  features require a Wi-Fi connection. Some features are not available\n  in all countries. Access to some services is limited to 10 devices.\n\nSince you're saying you're already in the family group, I expect the problem you're having is that you're using an Android device (the above seems to imply you need to be on macOS, iOS or Windows). I would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contact Apple to check if there is a way around this conundrum and, if not,\n\n*Send feedback to Apple as well as an email to support@apple.com (that's the email address they use for support re their Android apps).\n\n\nI would think that since Apple offers the Apple Music Android app that this is an unintended consequence of how things are currently set up, so sending feedback is the only way of getting things changed.\n", "Q: Lightweight SQL server to serve .sql content I have a python project that needs to access sql data. I actually have the contents of this database as .sql files and I'm wondering what's the fastest/lightest way to run my project\n\n\n*\n\n*The python project uses the import MySQLdb statement.\n\n*This led me to install pip install MySQL-python and brew install mysql-connector-c and then I'm trying to set up a MySQL server so I can finally run the program\n\n*If possible I'd like to avoid the huge official MYSQL editions I can find on the internet\n\n*I'm rather looking for lightweight alternatives\n\n\nIt it actually possible to find some lightweight (my)SQL server that would successfully let me connect from python or is there no avoiding the heavy official MySQL editions ?\n\nA: I use DB Browser for SQLite. It's free and has the feature I need, but it's pretty lightweight, so you won't have some features like SQL Procs, etc. I think it supports triggers though, so I guess you can get around the no-sql-proc issue by writing some triggers.\nThe database runs on SQLite, which is a pretty popular free version of SQL, so you should be able to find compatible Python packages for it. Like these for example: 11.13. sqlite3 or 12.6. sqlite3, but I don't use Python so I haven't tried either of them.\nAnyhow, it works well for me. I use it for managing data that's too messy to parse with excel. For doing analysis I use the Julia programing language (but Python should work just as well).\nEdit:\nIf you do decide to try SQLite and are wondering how to get your MySQL data into SQLite, here is a StackOverflow page that talks about exactly this.\n", "Q: Is there any alternatives to Karabiner in Sierra, which lets you use whatever keybindings you like to open an application? I have used Karabiner on El Capitan, but it is no longer working in Sierra. I used it to do whatever I like to do via keybindings, such as the followings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open an application\n\n*Switch to different languages\n\n*Automatically back to English when I open Alfred\n\n*Automatically back to English when I try to type in the search box in Chrome or Safari\n\n*Open any folders in my filesystem\n\n*Delete a character\n\n*Move to the first or last part of the sentence\n\n\nHowever, all of them are no longer working as Karabiner doesn't work in Sierra and the developer has not found much progress so far, which would likely take far more time to finally adjust to Sierra. I’ve not had success with Karabiner elements and specific tasks like swapping the colon and semicolon. \nSo I would like to use any alternatives, if any, to let me set whatever keybindings I want to do the set of tasks above. Is there any such app or workarounds on system that makes it feasible?\n\nA: You should try 'Keyboard Maestro' as an Alternative. You can bind actions to different Application-States as Macros, f.e. when Application X is open, do Y etc.\nThey offer a Testperiod, so you can try before you buy and test if it is meeting your requirements.\n\nA: I found that Hammerspoon is suitable for these sets of tasks. You write your own keyboard remapping, application shortcut, etc... on init.lua script. Some Lua knowledge might be required but if you have any programming experience in other languages, it is not that difficult.\nI have implemented all of the tasks on the question except Move to the first or last part of the sentence, and it sounds working well so far. It took me some time (around 20 hours) to fight with the script, though. \n", "Q: Install old version of Homebrew on Snow Leopard So I have a computer that is stuck on Snow Leopard.\nHow do I install Homebrew on such a old computer? Is this even possible?\nI tried the following command:\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nHowever this gives me an error about needing git and I don't know how to install an old version of that.\n\nA: Don't use Homebrew, use MacPorts!\nMacPorts does lots of work to support old versions of OS X. They backport kernel symbols and standard libraries. They maintain bespoke patches and a Snow Leopard build bot. MacPorts might just have the best legacy support of any Mac project under active development, and it's really kind of incredible.\nRunning Snow Leopard in 2021, and choosing Homebrew over MacPorts, is absolute madness!

They conduct consumer surveys at departmental stores using our inhouse built iPad app. They record consumer responses and give back to consumer a printout (A4 size) of the consent to participate in survey along with brief summary.\nProblem:\nMost sites either don't cooperate with our agents to provide them internet or they don't allow our printer (most of our printers are HP LaserJet M130 fw) to be on their network if they let them use the 'Guest' WiFi. For iPad printing both iPad and printer need to be on the same network. Is there any solution to it? We don't want to use cellular internet because of poor coverage and signal strength drops off frequently. So in short our agents need to be independent operative at their site without using their resources.\n\nA: If you have the option of buying new printers, you can buy a portable Bluetooth printer for them to use. Using Bluetooth you're no longer dependent on any WiFi, and the iPad can use its WiFi to connect to a guest network for internet access or anything you like.\nUsing a Bluetooth printer is possible because you have an in-house built app. The app would require slight tweaking to support the printer.\nFor example you could use the HP PJ-763MFI Bluetooth printer which is created for use over Bluetooth with iOS:\nhttps://www.brother.co.uk/mobile-printers/pocket-jet/pj-763mfi\nThe HP printer support A4/letter size paper.\nAnother option for smaller paper sizes are the popular Zebra printers that are certified for use over Bluetooth with iOS:\nhttps://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/printers/mobile/mz-series.html\nYou can also find similar printers from Star and others.\n", "Q: Recursively search for images, and move them to a date folder Asked a question 9 months ago about how to copy images to a backup folder.

A package is just a directory, apparently, but somehow Finder and Path Finder know it's a package. \nHow is this indicated in the file system? I've tried a few changes to a directory to make it a package but to no avail.\n\nA: As I have made a document-based application for macOS, I may help you understand a bit. Although @Monomeeth's answer is right, dealing with GUI is a lot better than Info.plist. People usually use another path. They subclass NSDocment, which provides the basis for file/bundle saving and loading. Then, people go to Xcode and under the \"General\" tab, define a document type, then go to \"Exported UTIs\" and export an UTI that conforms to com.apple.package. They read in with the NSFileWrapper class. This way, people won't have to do some tedious work with stuff like NSData.\nIf you want to create a bundle, check this answer. Simply create an empty macOS app and edit the \"Exported UTIs\" sections to taste.\n\nA: Had the same question, and found all the answers far from satisfactory. Here's my take (after 2 weeks of research).\nMost important thing to understand: MacOS (also iOS, iPadOS tvOS, watchOS) maintains some dynamic database of registered Universal Type Identifiers. Can't elaborate much here - big subject - but I'll say that a formal UTI can be paired with several \"tags\" (identifiers from other \"spaces\", like for example --- a filename Extension.\nEvery time a new application hits the Mac file-system, the OS peers into its Info.plist, and adds whatever new type definitions it finds there to its database.\nThe MacOS Framework responsible for communicating with this database is called LaunchServices and I now saw many of its APIs are deprecated and are to be replaced with the new UniformTypeIdentifiers framework - only available in MacOS Big Sur (11.x) and onward.\nThese frameworks are used by Finder, and all other facilities, to determine what data type to use for specific File, Directory, Package, data-in-memory, Paste-board object etc.\nSome higher-level Cocoa objects (NSURL, NSFileManager, NSWorkspace and others) also wrap around these frameworks, to provide type-related functionality (e.g. to give you the URLs of applications that can open a specific data-type, or to know whether a file/directory is actually a document's package, or to have an educated guess about a file for which you do NOT have an application on your Mac).\nTo directly answer the OP's question - I was NOT able (even looking down at kernel level) to find a \"package bit\" or \"bundle bit\" you can set to a directory - but EVEN IF IT EXISTS, it will NOT determine OS behavior towards some directory. It is always LaunchServices being consulted on the matter.\nAnother important distinction is between a Bundle and a Package. A \"Package\" is a file-system-object (file, directory, alias, whatever) that is to be presented and manipulated AS IF it was a single object (document file). If anything relies on the mysterious \"bundle bit\" --- it is the \"Package\" aspect of a directory/file/whatever.\nA \"Bundle\" on the other hand, is a FORMAL STRUCTURE of a directory, including an Info.plist with required entries, and other elements (such are apps, kernel-extensions, plugins etc.) that can be a package (like .app) or not (like .framework).\nI don't know if OPs question comes from their development needs, but I'll provide here a few related APIs that can be helpful.\nBOOL isPackage = [[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] isFilePackageAtPath:_filePath ]; // will only help with EXISTING path. DO READ the documentation in the header for this method.\n\nNSURL *fileURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:_documentPath isDirectory:YES];\nNSError *error = nil;\nNSNumber *value = nil;\nisPackage = ([fileURL getResourceValue:&value forKey:NSURLIsPackageKey error:&error] && [value boolValue]); // a more powerful alternative - read header for more \"resource keys\" you can use in this method - e.g. for determining content-type and not only the package. Again, this is meant to be used for existing files/directories.\n\n // this one is lower-level Core-Foundation tool that will work for non-existing objects - a \"what if\" question to LaunchServices.  \n CFArrayRef types = UTTypeCreateAllIdentifiersForTag( kUTTagClassFilenameExtension, (__bridge CFStringRef _Nonnull)(_filenameExtension), kUTTypePackage);\n CFIndex typeCount = CFArrayGetCount(types);\n switch (typeCount) {\n     case 0: _isDocument = NO; break; // no package UTI with this filename extension is known to LaunchServices.\n     case 1: {\n          CFStringRef type = CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(types, 0); \n          isPackage = ! CFStringHasPrefix(type, CFSTR(\"dyn.\")); // LaunchServices may synthesize a dynamic UTI when it doesn't know a filename extension.\n          break;\n     }\n     default: isPackage = YES; break;\n }\n CFRelease(types);\n\n\nA: Short answer\nTo register a document as a package, the developer of DayOne would have had to modify the document type information in the DayOne app's information property list (Info.plist) file.\nLong Answer\nA package is a file system directory used by macOS and iOS. It's basically a directory that will appear as a single file, but which may in fact contain a preserved state of files and folders. So, a folder could have a number of subfolders and many files, but as a package it will be displayed to users like a single file. For example, in macOS the Finder will see a package as a single file to avoid users mucking around with the actual  contents. However, users can view the contents through various methods such as right-clicking on the package and selecting Show Package Contents from the context menu.\nApple's Bundle Programming Guide, available on their Developer site, has a whole section on Document Packages. Below are some relevant quotes:\n\nTo register a document as a package, you must modify the document type\n  information in your application’s information property list\n  (Info.plist) file. The CFBundleDocumentTypes key stores information\n  about the document types your application supports. For each document\n  package type, include the LSTypeIsPackage key with an appropriate\n  value. The presence of this key tells the Finder and Launch Services\n  to treat directories with the given file extension as a package. For\n  more information about Info.plist keys, see Information Property List\n  Key Reference.\nDocument packages should always have an extension to identify\n  them—even though that extension may be hidden by the user. The\n  extension allows the Finder to identify your document directory and\n  treat it as a package. You should never associate a document package\n  with a MIME type or 4-byte OS type.\n\nSource: Bundle Programming Guide\nOn the off-chance you can't access the document, let me know and I'll include some additional quotes from the page.\n", "Q: White Screen of Death \nAs seen in the picture above, my Mac Pro is getting the white screen of death.

How? My iPhone was stolen 2 months ago and now someone is trying to blackmail me by the photos I had on the phone. I had a 4 digit home screen lock password and I activated Find my iPhone just after they stole it and I also activated the erase my iPhone option a couple of days later. I received an email from Apple once saying that \"erasing iPhone has started\".\nThe blackmailer has been sending me messages and photos which I only had on that phone and he also sent me a photo of my camera roll and home screen with a date and time matching the time he sent it (it seems like he took the photo just when he was texting me so I'm pretty sure he is not bluffing).\nHow do they have access to my photos? Is it possible that 'Lost Mode' and 'Erase iPhone' aren't working? He keeps asking for my Apple ID password even though it seems he already has access to the phone. What do you think is going on?\n\nA: Question 1\nYes, the Find My iPhone service is working along with its various actions (e.g. Lost Mode, Erase iPhone, etc).\nQuestion 2\nThis leaves us with how they accessed your data and what may have happened in your case. No-one can give you an absolutely 100% certain answer and in that sense this question could be judged as too broad or opinion-based to even be on topic for this site.\nHowever, in your question you state:\n\ni have activated find my iphone just after they stole it and I have also activated the erase my iphone option a couple of days later.\n\nNote the words I have bolded? It's not clear what just after means - that coud be in the order of mins, hours or more. And clearly, it's a couple of days after this point that you actioned the erasure of your iPhone.\nSo, presumably this person certainly had time to access your camera roll before the phone was erased.\nNow, the more difficult part to explain is the fact you had a 4 digit passcode on your iPhone. I see the following possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*The easiest possibility is that the iPhone was unlocked when they acquired it and they proceeded to change the Auto-Lock settings to never in order to access the data in the immediate short-term.\n\n*They already knew your passcode (i.e. they had seen you enter it; they do actually know you; they're in cahoots with someone you know; you previously fell victim to a phishing scam or similar; they obtained it somehow from someone you know, such as a child; etc).\n\n*Your passcode is something that wasn't hard to guess (e.g. you use it elsewhere, it's a D.O.B., etc).\n\n\nObviously from your comments, the person sending you the texts is unknown to you - but this does not eliminate the possibility that they know of you (either through a mutual friend/colleague/etc or because they've accessed some info from other sources). And if they are strongly motivated the perpetrator may have the time, budget, and equipment necessary to try and crack your 4 digit passcode. However, this is extremely unlikely - I would almost say impossible.\nThis is where it becomes extremely difficult for anyone to answer your second question. In this sense it is too broad as we just don't have all the necessary info, but I suspect the answer lies in the bullet points above.\n\nA: There are apps on desktops that one can use to connect to the phone while in airplane mode where you can see and copy everything without a passcode.\n", "Q: Issues after macOS Sierra upgrade I recently updated to macOS Sierra on my MacBook Air.

For uses like this, it generally means that you need to display the logo in a 'proper' way; what 'proper' means varies from company to company, but it usually includes things like not changing the color of the logo.\nFor the content, again this will vary per company, but usually you have to sign an agreement when using the SDK of said company. I don't know the specifics for Instagram, but this could include a section about giving you permission to show the content in your app, provided that you give attribution (to the company, the author of the photo, or both).\nFrom the documentation:\n\nIt’s your responsibility to determine and follow regulations that apply in each territory.\n\nThis is probably so that such third parties cannot sue Apple because there is an app available in their App Store violating the regulations; Apple will forward such complaints directly to the developer of the app.\n", "Q: All Tags Not Showing on Mac Right Click Ok, this is a simple one that has been bugging me for months. I've searched here, Google, everywhere for an answer. There is plenty of info about creating tags, changing the names/colors, assigning tags to Finder folders, even customizing the right click menu itself.\nMy tags just disappeared from the right click, not the tags section, just the tag color bubbles themselves. I could always click on the 'Tags...' button and that would load a tags dialog that I could then select the tags I wanted, but to more quickly tag I should see them below that.\n\nA: Finally, just annoyed one night I called Apple support since I still have coverage on my new Macbook. The lady struggled just like me, no articles there about it, couldn't figure out. But after about 30 mins of poking around, she figured it out. And it's WAY simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder > Preferences\n\n*Click on the Tags menu option\n\n*Here you will see a list where you can show/hide in your sidebar\n\n*Below that there is a little box, you can DRAG the tags from the upper section to the lower section which determines which tags show in your right click.\n\n\nThat's it. Simple. I'm dumb. Hopefully this helps someone.\n\nA: I encountered this problem after upgrading to current High Sierra. Green and Red tags did not appear in the Finder sidebar but previously tagged folders and documents did appear when \"All Tags...\" was selected from the Finder sidebar. Likewise, if I selected \"Documents\" in the Finder sidebar the previously tagged folders and documents appeared along with their previously tagged colors. I solved this by deselecting each previously tagged folder/document and then reselecting the desired color tag. Also, the red and green tag selections did not appear in the Finder sidebar, but these were easily added by just dragging them to the sidebar and placing them in the desired order under \"Tags\" in the sidebar.\n", "Q: Why is there static noise when playing media at zero volume on iPhone? I have iPhone 6 on iOS 10.3.\nRecently, while watching a video (not stored on my phone, but on YouTube on Firefox browser) with volume set to zero, I put the bottom speaker on the iPhone to my ear (because in the silence of the room, I heard something), and I heard static, despite volume being zero! I closed the tab, which caused the static noise to stop, then opened the Music app and played a song on zero volume, and when I put the bottom speaker next to my ear, the static noise had come back!\nIs this normal? Why is there static noise when media is playing at zero volume instead of no noise?\nMy Bluetooth is turned off, and the Alerts switch (whatever it's called) is turned off (I.e. You can see the orange line next to the volume buttons).\n\nA: Hmmm...I did the same thing and I noticed the static too! So, I contacted Apple Support via Online Chat with the exact same wording you provided as above and a helpful representative provided the following answer:\n\"Now light static is going to be normal on your device even if it is fully down because there’s audio playing. You don’t have anything to worry about.\"\nI replied:\n\"Ok, because I was worried that despite being on zero volume that the audio would suddenly start playing out loud! It's just that I wasn't aware of this before\"\nTo which Toya, the representative, replied:\n\"Yes I definitely understand. That’s never fun, but you’re good. Now if it ever becomes loud static or screechy you have a problem.\"\n=====================================\nSo there is no issue here!\n", "Q: iPhone 5S touchscreen become unresponsive, how to properly calibrate it? Recently my iPhone 5S has become frozen as there was no or very little memory to save even a picture, I thought it was a software issue and later when I tried to hard reset it by pressing the wake & home button the red screen appeared. Later I restored the iPhone with iTunes on a Windows PC. Everything went normal and restoration was successful with no issues, but later the touch screen became buggy. Especially the keypad freezes often and also every time the touchscreen freezes I supposed to lock and wake the phone again and again to make the touchscreen responsive. \nThere is less chance it would have a hardware damage. Because I am using a very rugged hard case cover as well the iPhone is wrapped up with Touch Screen Protector, hardening the glass. The phone is out of warranty as well. I never dropped even accidentally as well I always keep my phones in my pocket or either on my desk.   \nI even have tested the touch screen by removing the Hard Glass screen protector also, still the problem persists even after cleaning the phone properly. Moreover my phone has enough space now after the hard reset and restoration, more than 9 gigs to do IO read/write.\n\nA: I would suggest taking a full encrypted backup of the phone using iTunes. Then restore the phone with the latest iOS without restoring your backup.\nIf the problem with the touchscreen freezes persist, you most probably have a hardware error (or at least an error that is not user-fixable). If so, you'll have to take it in for repairs.\nIf the problem with the touchscreen disappears, the problem could be a corruption in the settings in your backup. If you can do without restoring the backup, that would be ideal - otherwise you'll have to use third party utils to pick and choose stuff from the backup and copy them to the device again.\n", "Q: File-paths in iCloud: Tilde ( ~ ) within the paths. What's the meaning? The tilde-character is a short-cut for the home-directory of the currently logged-in user (in UNIX-like operating systems).\nIn the paths of iCloud-directories it is included too. \nFor example:\ncom~apple~CloudDocs\n\nor \ncom~apple~mail\n\nWhat is it's meaning there?\nAnd in general:\nWhat's the reason for these weird file-paths?\n\nA: The reason for naming things like that starting with top level domain and going down to being more and more specific is to have them grouped automatically when listing them. This is common practise for things like java classes or preference files (but usually separated by dots).\nUsing the tilde character has nothing to do with the home directory tilde. I guess it's just one of the last remaining symbols of the standard charset without a special meaning in this context, while .:;<>$/\"*# and so on may have conflicts with different interpretations.\n", "Q: Exchange old MacBook keyboard with newer I have a MacBook Pro from Late 2014 (I think).

The keyboards are not compatible.\n", "Q: How to upload the 4k videos taken to YouTube? iPhone 7 Plus can take 4k videos, but if you click on the Photos app and upload to YouTube, for some reason it is limited to 240p. If you click on the YouTube app and upload, then it is 1080p.\nIs there a way to upload directly from iPhone to YouTube in 4k resolution?\nI think one way that will work is to transfer the video to the computer first, and then transfer from the computer to YouTube, but is there a way to directly do it on the iPhone, I wonder.\n\nA: This is a limitation of Apple's Photos.app as of iOS 10.3.1.\nPhotos.app limits video uploads to 720p/1080p.\nTo upload 4K videos from your iPhone to YouTube you can use Apple's iMovie for iOS. iMovie for iOS is free for all users since April 18 2017.\nUnfortunately you have to use a second app to accomplish a 4K upload.\n", "Q: How to get around space limitations in iOS? Apple seems to take out a lot of profit-margin on Memory.  I don't like to pay that much \"Just to be sure\".   How easy is it to get around the limitations?\nI am thinking of something like wireless disks, moving stuff to/from backup locations and silently pushing recorded photos and videos to somewhere else.\nI know this can easily be done for different kinds of space hogs?\n(I know it can easily be done for movies)\n\nA: If you're asking if this can easily be done for different kinds of space hogs, the answer is yes.\nFor example you could be using iCloud to push photos, videos, etc. out in the cloud to limit the amount of space used on the device itself.\nYou can also purchase wireless disks, tethered disks, etc. to store files on there. They usually come with third party apps to manage the space and move files around.\nNote however that you cannot keep apps anywhere but the local device if you want to be able to run them.\n", "Q: GENKI Vocab Cards app doesn't play sound I have just purchased the GENKI Vocab Cards app for reviewing vocabulary from the GENKI Japanese textbook.

If I open this application using Safari on iOS and complete the login screen, iOS asks me if I want to save my credentials.\nbut it doesn't work the same way if I add this webapp as a link on the springboard. In that case, iOS doesn't ask me to save my credentials.\nWhy iOS handle these 2 cases in a different way ?\n\nA: It is handled differently because it is two different web engines powering the two.\nWhen you use Safari you're using the newer Nitro-accelerated Javascript engine similar to the WKWebView, you can use in your own apps.\nHowever, when you add the app to the home screen and open it in full screen, it won't be powered by the Nitro-accelerated Javascript engine, and will run in what is essentially the same as the UIWebView, that you can also use in your own apps.\nEarlier Apple only allowed third party apps to use UIWebView, and not the newer Nitro-accelerated engine. The reason for the home screen links to be subject to this restriction is probably a leftover from that policy.\nHowever, the reasoning behind why Apple choose to do it this way is impossible to say.\n", "Q: Videos not autoplaying in Safari in 10.12 In website sites like Twitter & Facebook, I used to (can’t remember when things “broke”) have videos autoplay, but they no longer do.

My internal HD (disk0) now looks like this:\n\n\nI have a backup of my internalHD on disk1, so I could just delete the disk and reinstall everything but I'm curious if the HD can be restored without doing this, so no worries about data loss if the attempt fails.\nMy thoughts on how to solve this are to implement the following procedure:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Copy the ESP from disk1, and add it to a new partition on disk0 (I don't know if this can be done simultaneously, so the newly created partition has the exact size of the ESP, or if I need to create a partition and then copy the ESP into it).\n  \n*Move the newly created partition from disk0s3 to disk0s1, and then disk0s3 (internal HD) to disk0s2.\n  \n\nI don't know if this will solve the problem, of it can be done, and if so, how to do it.\nAny suggestions are welcome!\n\nA: Googling the error message I get a plethora of different causes: e.g. no space on the main volume, broken SATA cables etc.\nSo restoring or rebuilding the EFI partition probably won't solve your problem.\nRecreating a/the EFI partition should be easy though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create some OS X installer thumb drive\n\n*Detach your external drive\n\n*Boot to the thumb drive.\n\n*Open Terminal in the menubar > Utilities\n\n*Enter diskutil list to get the disk identifier of your internal disk (probably disk0) - you will get about 12-14 disks almost all of them related to the thumb drive. Check the sizes to get the right one - below I assume it's disk0.\n\n*Unmount disk0 with diskutil umountDisk disk0\n\n*Check partition table:\ngpt show -r /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Remove the two existing partitions:\ngpt remove -i 1 /dev/disk0\ngpt remove -i 2 /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Create a new partition and re-add the other two:\ngpt add -i 1 -b 40 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk0\ngpt add -i 3 -b 1952255592 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 1951845952 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\n\n*If the disk is stubborn destroy the gpt and a add a new one:\ngpt destroy /dev/disk0\ngpt create -f /dev/disk0\n\nNow repeat the previous step and add the three partitions.\n\n*Attach the external drive\n\n*Get the disk identifier of the external drive with diskutil list (probably disk14 or even higher - below I assume it's disk14)\n\n*Unmount disk0 with diskutil umountDisk disk0\n\n*Unmount disk14 with diskutil umountDisk disk14\n\n*Clone the EFI partition of the external drive to your internal drvie with:\ndd if=/dev/disk14s1 of=/dev/disk0s1 bs=1m\n\n\n*Enter reboot to reboot your Mac\n\n", "Q: Apple watch always displays the wrong high temperature I'm having trouble understanding the Apple watch high and low temperature values. They are never correct. \nIn Nyc, the high is going to be 81 today. However when I looked this morning it said 72 degrees.  When I scroll forward I get time travel to update the weather values. Somewhat. \nRight now as I scroll the low value for the day is 57. But as I scroll the high value keeps changing. \nIs this a bug?  What is the frame of reference? (High in the past hour, past day, etc)\n\nA: I've found that this happens because of the delay introduced by the network and retrieving the temperature for your location. \nMany things have to happen to show you the temperatures. I see this same thing on my iPhone but I think it's more noticeable on the Watch because you're staring at it, waiting for the data.   You can be looking at the old data while the app gets the latest updates and then the numbers will change as the new data rolls in. \nIn addition, some apps, such as Weather Underground, take an extremely long time to do their updates. I've even given-up using some weather apps because of this delay. \n", "Q: Choppy Audio with Plantronics USB headset after software update My MacBook Pro Retina updated last night (10-APR-17).

I own the MacBook Pro 13\" 2016 model. It has two thunderport 3 ports on the left side of itself.\nI have two Samsung monitors with a HDMI IN on both monitors. \nDo I need to buy two Thunderbold 3 to HDMI adapters, to connect both my monitors?\nI just tried connecting them with a HDMI Splitter, but it only shows the same content on both monitors. I just found out, that a single HDMI cable can only show content for one monitor or split the same content to two monitors. So that just failed hard. \nBut the only option is to then have two adapter connected at the same time, to get use of both my monitors...? \nEDIT: I've tried to search for similar answers but could not find anything. Also I have a HDMI splitter, which just simply displays the same content on both monitors, so that was little to none help.\nI've got on Thunderbolt to HDMI, 2x USB and another Thunderbolt port. \nBest solution would be a adapter with one Thunderbolt port but with two HDMI ports.\n\nA: If you want a single cable solution, have a look at the CalDigit Thunderbolt Station.\nYou will need to go from DisplayPort to HDMI and then Thunderbolt/USBC to HDMI (another adapter), but you will be able to connect two HDMI monitors ultimately from one (Thunderbolt) USB-C cable from your Mac.\n\nNow, if your Samsung monitor supports Display Port, I would use that interface instead of going to HDMI.  So, I would use a Display Port to Display Port cable and a USB-C to Display Port adapter (instead of HDMI).  \nThere's a really good review of it on YouTube\n\nA: Yes, you need to use a USB-C/Thunderbolt3 to HDMI adapter.\nmacOS will update the display output as you connect them to your MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: Relogin in apple services after Apple ID password is changed Is it necessary to relogin (logout and login again) in apple services on MacOS after Apple ID password has been changed?\n\nA: It's not necessary but it's a good practice.  Some services will not work because they can no longer log-in.\nThe services you use for iCloud, iTunes, etc, will be trying to log-in using an old password.  That will fail and it will prompt you for your password.  This will keep happening until you enter the correct password.\nIf you want to bypass all those notifications you can log-out and then log-in again with your updated credentials.\n", "Q: Google Authenticator on iPhone 7 can not edit/remove entries I have been handed this phone from my workplace and have to use it.

This will show you all the bootable partitions that the Mac can find. If the partition Internal HD in your internal drive does not show up then EFI has not discovered the required files for a boot partition and the OS on it can be considered damaged and should be replaced.\nFrom what you describe I suspect some sort of damage to the low level formatting of the partition.\nAt this point I would boot from another partition and use Carbon Copy Cloner or a similar tool to backup the damaged partition and then erase and reformat the entire drive before installing a new System or a known good backup.\n", "Q: Restore/synchronize Messages history Is there a good way to \"force-synchronize\" the Messages history between two Apple devices?

Unfortunately, for whatever (probably music industry-enforced) reason, Apple's own AirPlay technology does not allow sending audio from a Mac or Windows PC to an iOS device. Fortunately, there are 3rd-party solutions that do allow this, like AirFoil. \n", "Q: Erased /usr/local/bin directory by mistake I am a somewhat newbie to Unix.  I recently started a bash tutorial where I created a hello world bash script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\necho 'Hello World!'\n\nthen, I moved it into /usr/local/bin using this command:\nsudo mv hello.sh /usr/local/bin\n\nnow /bin under /usr/local is no longer a directory, but a file, and when using ls -l on it, I get this output:\nMacBook-Pro-de-Omar:local omarnavarro$ ls\nbin\nMacBook-Pro-de-Omar:local omarnavarro$ ls -l\ntotal 8\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 omarnavarro  staff  32 Apr 11 19:27 bin\nMacBook-Pro-de-Omar:local omarnavarro$ cat bin\n#!/bin/bash\necho 'Hello world!'\n\nI understand that /usr/local/bin is part of the $PATH, and so I believe there must have been lots of commands in there.  Will this affect me much?  how can I restore the commands that previously lived in /usr/local/bin when it was a directory.  I can't believe I screwed up so badly!\n\nA: The canonical answer, of course, is to restore /usr/local/bin from your latest backup...\nThe good news is that if that mv command succeeded and created a file called bin, then /usr/local/bin didn't already exist as a directory on your system, and you've lost nothing. Otherwise, hello.sh would have been moved into the /usr/local/bin directory (which was presumably the intention of the tutorial), it wouldn't have replaced it. \nThis is not unexpected, as /usr/local/bin doesn't generally exist on Macs until you or a 3rd party app creates it. But now you have learned the awesome power of the command line, you know why it's important to keep good backups ;)\nHad you mangled /usr/bin you'd need to reinstall the system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleted /usr/local/bin and /usr/bin on OS X\nThe good news is system integrity protection (SIP) is making it harder to mangle system files with sudo\nPS: An easy way to prevent the issue from happening is to always add a trailing / if moving files to another directory (or rely on tab completion wich does the same thing): sudo mv hello.sh /usr/local/bin/. This way you'll get an error message if the target directory doesn't exist.\n", "Q: Time Capsule & 3TB HDD Raid 1 setup I have the Airport Time Capsule (3TB) connected to a 3TB HDD via the Airport Time Capsule's USB2 port.\nHow can I set them up with RAID 1?\n\nA: The time Capsule would need to be jailbroken and modified to get RAID drivers into that software stack. It would probably be easier to physically remove the drives and build a new enclosure that can support RAID with the drives and then either connect that to the network or somehow connect the controller to the hopefully still functioning Time Capsule via USB. \nBasically, including time capsule in a raid is a \"no\" answer, you can't reasonably do RAID 1 mirroring or any standard RAID level. \n", "Q: How to write a service to get some string?

I have 50GB of iCloud storage and want to backup all my photos. If I make a regular iCloud backup it says the following:\n\nSo I assumed it was my backing up my photos until I stumbled upon this page a few days later.\n\nBefore I had iCloud Photo Library switched off and now I switched it on it says it is uploading 4000 photos. \nI'm a little confused. Does iCloud not backup photos unless you switch on iCloud Photo Library? Or does it? \n\nA: [NOTE: The following comments are based on using iOS 12 (I believe the same is true for iOS 11)]. \nIf you turn iCloud Photo \"off\" (i.e. your photos will not be uploaded to iCloud for syncing across devices), then you'd want to make sure your photos/videos are being backed-up as part of your routine iCloud backup (i.e. the process that takes place when your phone is connected to power, locked, and connected to wi-fi). To do this using your iDevice, go into Settings > click on the Account Name > iCloud > Manage Storage > Backups (note: this will list all your device backups stored on iCloud) > then click the applicable backup file based on the device name). If Photo Library is \"off\" then your photos are NOT being included in the routine device backup.\nThat being said, if you are not using iCloud Photo, then you'd want to make sure the Photo Library option is turned \"ON\". That way, if you ever switch devices, your photos/videos can be restored to the new device using the latest device backup. So it's important to make sure the routine backups are happening which should be the case if powered, locked, and connected to wi-fi.\nIn summary - use iCloud Photo for connivence and for syncing photos/video automatically across devices. The photos/videos will be backed-up (i.e. uploaded) to iCloud automatically. If you use this option, then your Photos will NOT be included in your routine iCloud backup as that would mean you'd upload the media twice and quickly burn through your available iCloud space. \nIf you do not use iCloud Photo, then ensure the Photo Library option (which is part of your device's routine iCloud backup) is turned \"ON\" to ensure your photos/video are included in the routine backups. But also check to ensure your phone is actually doing the backups - remember, your device must be connected to powered, locked, and on wifi....so don't just assume it's happening because your phone isn't being used.\nSuggestion: If you have multiple Apple devices and want carefree sync options, then using iCloud Photo might be the way to go - esp if you have good storage available on iCloud and your device.\n\nA: iOS does backup your photos as part of its normal backup process, unless you enable iCloud Photo Library, in which case:\n\nPhoto Library is backed up separately as part of iCloud Photo Library.\n\n\nThrough the normal backup process (iCloud Photo Library disabled), your photos are backed up at most once every 24 hours along with the rest of your data, when your iPhone is on Wi-Fi, charged, and locked. Those photos can only be recovered by restoring your iPhone from your iCloud backup.\nWith iCloud Photo Library enabled, your photos get uploaded to iCloud every time you’re on Wi-Fi. This is a syncing process rather than a “backup” per se. However in the event that you lose your iPhone you will still be able to recover your photos from iCloud (even without restoring your new iPhone from backup). Therefore this option acts as a backup for your photos.\nThis distinction is a bit of a technicality, but the important part is you can consider your photos backed up to iCloud, no matter which option you choose. Since there is no need to backup your photos to iCloud twice, iOS only does one or the other.\nWhat you’re seeing in that second screen is your photos being uploaded to your iCloud Photo Library specifically. It’s a different/separate method from the regular backup, which is why the photos need to be uploaded again. It doesn’t mean your photos never got backed up before.\nIf you have multiple Apple devices, I would advise you to keep using iCloud Photo Library, since that presents many advantages beyond a simple backup: quicker backup of your photos, synchronizing photos across devices, saving storage on your iPhone, allowing you to bring all your photos onto a new device, etc.\n\nA: NO! It does not back up your photos if iCloud photo library is switched off. I lost 9000 precious pictures and memories of my daughters first year of life because I didn't know this. Along with all the photos I use for my online business. The AT&T guy didn't catch it.\nMake sure your photos are backed up and check if photo sharing on iCloud is  turned on!!\n", "Q: How to disable scrolling while clicking with the Magic Mouse? I want to disable one finger scrolling with my Magic Mouse while I click with it, because I don't like that it scrolls the content in apps if I click something. I also don't see any practical use of letting this thing enabled.\nVideo about my problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqCo3mEH51A\nVery important, that I want to keep the scrolling on, which I generally love, so shrinking the scroll area with MagicPrefs or disabling scrolling fully is not a good workaround for me.\nAre there any tools which let me disable any scroll events during the mouse button is down?\n\nA: Since we've established that your Magic Mouse doesn't have this behaviour with another computer, I'd reset your NVRAM and also do a boot into Safe Mode.\nResetting the NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). \nSince you haven't specified what model of Mac you're using, below are some generic steps that will work with all models (including all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models):\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionPR keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNow test your Magic Mouse to determine if the issue is still present. If this doesn't resolve it for you, proceed to booting into Safe Mode.\nNote 1: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. test your Magic Mouse)\n\n*Now exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Again, take a note of what happens (i.e. test your Magic Mouse)\n\n\nOnce you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went and we'll go from there.\nTrash Magic Mouse .plist files\nSince your issue persists both in and out of Safe Mode, I would trash the relevant Magic Mouse preference files.\nAs you don't specify what version of macOS you're using, I'll assume you're running a version from Mountain Lion and above. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder\n\n*Press and hold the option key\n\n*While keeping the option key down, click on the Go menu and select Library from the list\n\n*This should open up your user's Library folder in a new Finder window\n\n*Locate and open the Preferences folder (it's within the Library folder)\n\n*Within this folder find the following two .plist files:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.AppleMultitouchMouse.plist\n\n*com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist\n\n\n*Now Trash these files\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n\nYour Mac will now create a new set of default preference files for your Magic Mouse. \nNote: You will need to go back to System Preferences and reconfigure your Magic Mouse settings. However, before doing that I would test the Magic Mouse first to see if the problem behaviour still persists.\nReset Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller\nThis is something I've had a number of users do to resolve issues with 3rd party Bluetooth devices (usually a keyboard and/or mouse, but also headphones etc).\nSince you're using a genuine Apple Magic Mouse you my decide not to bother, but I think it's worth trying.\nIn a nutshell you need to reset both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller. However, this will reset all connected Bluetooth devices, including your keyboard and mouse, so each Bluetooth device will need to be paired again.\nI have some steps you can follow, but I strongly suggest you read all of the steps first before commencing (or perhaps print out the instructions / view them on another device).\nBefore starting, ensure you have the Bluetooth icon showing in the menu bar. If it is not there, open System Preferences > Bluetooth and enable the option Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar.\nAlso, since you're trying to resolve an issue with your Magic Mouse,  you will need to use another mouse to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. Once the menu is showing, release the keys.    \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu, choose Debug > Remove All Devices\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys again and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu,  choose Debug > Reset the Bluetooth Module\n\n*Shutdown your Mac\n\n*Ensure your Magic Mouse is fully powered off\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*On your Mac, click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar \n\n*Select the Set Up Bluetooth Device option\n\n*On the mouse, turn the power on\n\n*Once the Setup Assistant finds the mouse, select it from the list and click on “Continue”. \n\n*Now pair your mouse\n\n*If you have any other Bluetooth devices, you can go ahead and pair them now (or you can do it later). \n\n\nLet me know how you go.\n\nA: The final solution for this issue: a non-documented option of BetterTouchTool:\ndefaults write com.hegenberg.BetterTouchTool BTTBlockMagicMouseScrollWhenClicked YES\n\nA: I found a solution to this that works for me.  When I need \"fine touch\" while clicking, I put two fingers rather than on the mouse.  The mouse is far less sensitive to scroll when it registers two fingers.\nIt took a small bit of getting used to this new behavior, but then there was quickly less foul language and more work done.  ...and I still have the scroll feature (up-down and left-right) for browsing and reading.\n\nA: This might sound like a strange solution, but you should try using your Magic Mouse on a different surface.\nI recently changed my mouse mat/surface and this sort of strange Magic Mouse behaviour has all but disappeared.\nMy old surface was so worn/used it had started to become shiny in patches. My guess is that these shiny patches are causing the mouse to report abnormal patterns of signals, which causes all manner of strange behaviour in general use.\n", "Q: How to tell if certain pre-2015 app is 64 bit?

How can i be absolutely sure, that - just in case the rumors come true - I can still use it?\n\nA: The easy way for me is to install the app on iOS 10.3 (or later) device. \nThen open the settings app.\n\n\n*\n\n*tap general\n\n*tap About\n\n*tap Applications\n\n\niOS will report on the possibility to update all 32 bit apps you have installed on the device by letting you tap to each entry in the App Store where the developer web site is another tap away. \n\n", "Q: My signed .pkg file is not accepted I'm struggling with signing my installer to keep Gatekeeper happy.\n\nWhen building i sign the .pkg:\nproductsign --sign \"3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: GNXXXXXXXXXX (XXXXXXXXXXX)\" UnsignedJaXXXXXXXXXX0.5.pkg JaXXXXXXXXXXt0.5.pkg\n\nusing this certificate:\n\nWhen checking with pkgutil I can see that the file is signed:\n\nHowever still Gatekeeper is not happy.\nspctl gives this result:\n\nWhat am I missing?\nUpdate\nspctl with verbose:\n\n\nA: You're using a signing identity that can only be used for Mac App Store distribution. You cannot sign with that identity and test it on your own Mac before submitting it to the Mac App Store - it won't pass GateKeeper validation.\nIf you want to create an installer for distribution outside the Mac App Store, you'll need to use a signing identity prefixed \"Developer ID Installer\".\n\nA: As jksoegaard said, you need to use a signing key prefixed with Developer ID Installer.\nIf you're using an organizational apple developer account, you may need your account owner to create it. (Current docs suggest any admin can, but I have not found that to be the case)\nAs of today, this option is titled \"Developer ID Application\" and is the last one you can select.\n", "Q: Batch replace substring with another in filenames I have a bunch of files named similar to this:\n1_1.pngEND1_1.png\n\nHow would you replace .pngEND with _?\nI've googled this problem and tried  literally 5+ solutions, non of which worked on mac.\n\nA: There are tons of ways to do this, for instance\nfor i in *pngEND*.png; do [[ -e ${i/.pngEND/_} ]] || echo mv \"$i\" \"${i/.pngEND/_}\"; done\n\nRemove the echo if the output looks sensible. \n\nA: If your not familier with terminal or scripts, you can use the mac app called NameChanger (free to use). You can change almost everything in batch on filenames / file extentions.\n\nA: Unless you need a solution you can use in a script, you can do this directly in Finder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the files you want to rename\n\n*Right click one of them, and choose Rename N Items...

It also has a dry run option so you can test before you execute the changes.\n", "Q: Cursor changes position in input line after I highlight some text to overwrite it My problem is that when I highlight some text (doesn't matter where or in which application) in order to write over it the cursor, sometimes, suddenly changes position causing a lot of typos.\nLet's say I've searched the phrase \"stack exchange apple\" in Google.\nNow I want to search for stack overflow so I first highlight \"exchange\" and \"apple\" this way:\n\nand then I simply type \"overflow\" in order to write over the highlighted text. What I sometimes end up with is this:\n\nAnd I can assure you that I didn't press any arrow keys or trackpad or mouse button of sort. I simply wrote in the keyboard \"overflow\" but what happened is that after I pressed \"O\" the cursor changed position and the word ended up like this.\nI'm running macOS Sierra v10.12.4 on a Mid-2014 15\" Macbook Pro\nAre there things that can fail or settings to help with this?\n\nA: The most likely culprit once you rule out Bluetooth mouse / trackpad and any wrist or liquid input is hardware. \nIf you can reproduce this on a clean os install onto an external drive (to avoid wiping your normal drive and files and apps) it could be:\n\n\n*\n\n*failing battery pressing underneath the trackpad\n\n*failing or damaged capacitive sensing grid \n\n*failing chip that processes the capacitive touch sensor\n\n\nIt's unlikely to be software, but I'd still download and install a clean and updated os to be sure unless you have close and easy access to hardware service. \n\nA: Same exact problem.  I'd be very surprised if this were a physical issue.  I have the same problem on two separate Macbook Pro's.  Also happens in multiple applications.  There's definitely no mousepad bumping either. \n Unfortunately, the behavior difficult to reproduce.\n", "Q: Touch Bar Media Play/Pause button controls Safari, not iTunes I often want to pause my iTunes music when watching a video in Safari. Currently on some sites (but not all) the Pause button starts controlling the video in Safari in stead of iTunes. \nHow to permanently link the buttons to iTunes? \n\nA: BeardedSpice, solved this for me. It was intended to allow the media keys to control services in Chrome, but it also can lock the media keys to iTunes.\n\nA: The touch bar is context sensitive and changes depending on which app is running. The touch bar will control the foreground application or the one that is currently active active. If you are watching a video on Safari the toucher will control Safari, to get it to control iTunes you will need to make iTunes the active application.\n", "Q: Installing Xcode from App Store doesn't seem to work I'm having a rather odd problem.\nI've installed Xcode from the App Store three times now. No errors are being presented to me, but after installing Xcode I can press Open (in the App Store) and nothing happens. Refresh the view in App Store and I can press Install again.\nWhat's going on?\nI'm on Sierra 10.12.4 if that matters.\n\nA: Given Xcode.app appears in the /Applications and can be launched, the behaviour suggests Spotlight has yet to notice the newly installed application.\nIt is likely Apple's App Store application uses Spotlight to determine if applications are installed; thus the ability to Install Xcode.app re-appears on refresh.\nI suspect the bug will vanish once Spotlight re-indexes your applications.\nConsider telling Apple directly about this bug through their feedback form.\n", "Q: iPhone untrusted certificate warning My iPhone 7 iOS 10.3.1 randomly started receiving untrusted certificate pop-ups from onboard.info (but I’ve seen it on devices going back to iPhone 5):\nThis was at home last night and I had just unlocked my phone. I tried to get a screenshot of the rest of the certificate details but it was registered as just a home button press and there is no way to switch back into the certificate warning dialogue by changing apps.\nI can’t apply any logic to the root cause of this or recreate it. I’ve never clicked Trust for obvious reasons.\nCan anyone explain?\n21/04/17 - Just happened again.  The irony of the backdrop in this picture is not lost on me.  Is this some sort of MITM attack?\n\n\nA: Yes, it seems to be a MITM attack. The pcr.apple.com has a certificate issued by Symantec for Apple - but you're getting an entirely different, self-signed certificate. \nNote that MITM doesn't mean that it must be a \"malicious\" attack as such.\nYou do not mention the internet source you're connected to when the problem occurs. Some connections, particular public WiFi such as in restaurants, on trains and busses, etc. will use seemingly MITM for presenting sign-on pages for their WiFi, or for the purpose of injecting ads into web pages.\nThe certificate you're getting is from an Icomera system. They supply systems for passenger WiFi on trains and busses. If you're using such WiFi, this is the source of your problems.\nAnd yes, it is a terrible practice for Icomera and others to be building their systems like this.\n", "Q: Why can't I see the three dots when someone with a iPhone is texting me back? Everyone with an iPhone tells me they can see when I'm texting back because of the three dots. My question is: why can't I see the three dots when someone is texting me? I have an iPhone SE.\n\nA: The 3 dots only show when someone is using iMessage. If someone is texting you via SMS you won't see the typing awareness indicator.\n\nA: It is possible your contact has a jailbroken phone and has disabled the typing awareness indicator. The indicator also will not display if they receive the text but, for some reason, lose internet connectivity while they are writing their response.\nIf that person is replying and not using iMessage (eg. if they have it disabled, or temporarily disabled) then the indicator will not appear either.\n", "Q: Does \"Background App Refresh\" only refresh data or does it also allow the app to update in background? I do not prefer automatic updates because they can change the function of an app unexpectedly as well as use bandwidth when I am trying to do something else on the internet.\n\nA: Background app refreshing is just checking for new content and updating it in the app while the app is running in the background. I've never heard of an app actually updating itself and calling it a background refresh, and if it did that would certainly be a case of the developers mistaking the meaning of 'background refresh'.\nAutomatic updating is usually a separate setting (either in the app's preferences or the app store, depending upon which app you are talking about).\n", "Q: Does the TouchBar have its own GPU, CPU, or Ram? I want to know if the touch bar uses a miniature iOS-style CPU and processor, or does it share CPU, GPU, and other aspects with the main computer?\nCan I (in theory) offload tasks (GPU/CPU,etc) to the touch bar? \n\nA: This answer may not get to the crux of what you're wanting to do, but I offer it because I think your question is one that will interest a lot of people.\nApple’s Touch Bar MBP models actually use an Apple designed T1 chip that helps power both the Touch Bar and the Touch ID sensor. I say helps because this works in conjunction with the Intel CPU at the core of the MBPs. This T1 chip is actually the same that sits within the S2 in the current Series 2 Apple Watch models (it's being used as the processor and the Secure Enclave1).\nDuring Apple's keynote it was revealed that in addition to being used for the Touch Bar, the T1 also handles security for the Touch ID sensor, the camera, and the keychain.\nIn terms of the Touch Bar, while the T1 does the sending of pixels to it, the main Intel processor is what actually renders the content that the T1 sends across. \nIn terms of security, the T1 is responsible for rendering any Apple Pay dialogs (because it's able to leverage off the Secure Enclave) while the actual transmission of any Apple Pay data is actioned by the main Intel processor.\nIn terms of what you want to do (i.e. offloading tasks to the T1), I'm not sure if/how this would work as I've only done iOS development. However, I do know that developing anything for the Touch Bar requires a Mac running macOS Sierra and Xcode 8.1 or above. Below are some resources that may be of interest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Human Interface Guidelines for the Touch Bar\n\n*NSTouchBar\n\n*NSTouchBar Catalog: Creating and Customizing NSTouchBar\n1. The Secure Enclave is a segregated portion of the chip used for personal information - the same process used in iOS and Apple Watch devices. You can read more about this in the iOS Security Guide.\n", "Q: Where does Safari store the homepage URL? For unknown reasons I cannot change the once-set homepage URL in Safari (v10.1 on OS X 10.11.6) any more. If I change it in Safari's Preferences window, under General, it simply resets it to the value it was set to before. Same when I use the \"Set to current page\" button.\nThe same problem is with Safari 10.1 on another Mac running 10.10.5. I wonder if it's because they're both using iCloud, sharing their bookmarks. However, the homepage is set to a different page on each Mac, which suggests that this address is not synched with the bookmarks (which is good, IMO). And turning off iCloud Safari sharing doesn't help, either.\nSo I am trying to figure out where it stores the URL on disk, so that I can check if that is somehow locked.\nHowever, I cannot find the current homepage URL in various places. Neither in the Safari preferences file (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist) nor in any file inside ~/Library/Safari/ (including Bookmarks.plist) and ~/Library/WebKit/, at least not in plain ASCII text.\nWhere is that URL stored?\n\nA: In older Safari versions you could set it via defaults write com.apple.Safari HomePage -string \"http://example.com\". Safari seems to have done away with that at least since MacOS 10.11 (and possibly earlier). From this device management thread it looks like it's stored in iCloud, but in a rather opaque way.\n", "Q: Accessing certain files on external HD without entire backup from External HD How do I access certain files without backing up my Mac from entire backup from portable hard drive? My external hard drive is full. It has the same capacity as my Mac internal hard drive. I' did a wipe on my internal hard drive to keep it running. When I plug my external up, it does a complete back up, fills my internal drive and makes my computer error out because my internal HD is now full.\nHow do I upload certain files on my external to my Internal HD without having a full backup? or better yet, How do I delete/remove files on my external HD without it completing a full backup to my Internal HD?\n\nA: If you made your backup using Time Machine, you can restore files from a specific data by selecting the file and then clicking the restore button.\n\nEnter Time Machine\nFirst we need to enter Time Machine. We can do this in 2 ways:\n1. Click the Time Machine icon in the menu bar (it's located in top right corner) and choose \"Enter Time Machine\"\n2. Open Time Machine from the Applications folder.\n\nRestoring a file\nOnce we've entered the Time Machine, browse for the file(s) that you want to be restored. You can choose a different backup time from the right side of the screen.\nWhen you selected a file, you can press the space button to have a preview of the file.\nOnce you are sure you have the correct file(s), click the \"Restore\" button in the bottom of the screen.\n\nSource: Apple Support\n", "Q: Minimum display resolution for macOS Sierra on Mac Mini (2011 or later)? I'm considering getting a secondhand Mac Mini (2011 model or later) for use as a media and backup server. \nMost of the time it won't need a screen attached to it, but I'll need one in order to initially set it up, and perhaps for occasional maintenance or upgrades. I don't currently have a monitor or TV so I'll need to get hold of some sort of screen for it and I'd prefer it to be both cheap and small. \nI can see monitors on sale in the 8\" to 10\" size range, with resolutions from 800 x 480 to 1280 x 800. What is the minimum resolution this screen needs to support, to be compatible with either the Mac Mini hardware or macOS Sierra itself? I can't easily find this information on the Apple site or elsewhere. \nIt doesn't have to be comfortable to use, just possible - i.e. the macOS installer must run, standard dialog boxes must display on the screen, and so on. I'm aware that 15\" and 17\" LCD screens are available for next to nothing, but I really want something smaller due to limited storage space.\n\nA: The minimum resolution supported is 640x480. To get to this resolution (at least on my monitors on Sierra), when I'm in display preferences, I have to Control + click on \"Scaled\". This gives every resolution option, not just the main ones Apple thinks I want to use.\n", "Q: Defective bluetooth in MBPr? I have had a MacBook Pro (Retina, Early 2015) since October 2015.  Recently, I started feeling that the Bluetooth hardware might be defective.  It started a few months ago where I started being bombarded by Bluetooth pairing requests from different kinds of devices (even though the bluetooth settings say that my device should not be discoverable).  \nI did a clean install when I first started to encounter the symptoms.  I tried to follow different workarounds and fixes.  I found one which included modifying the bluetooth plist file but none of them seemed to be effective.  What's driving me crazy is that other people who have Macs in my office do not face the same issue!  \nMore recently, I started getting a \"Bluetooth unavailable\" message from time to time. My Bluetooth headphones also keep breaking up constantly while they are connected to the MBPr. \nI think there might be a hardware issue with my laptop.  Any thoughts?\n\nA: I would install a clean os to the internal drive or an external drive. Since you have so many pairing requests, you should be able to rule out software issues quickly and for free or very low cost. \nThen you would seek hardware repair or service. \n", "Q: How do I upgrade my openssl?

I am worried that I may delete files that the operating system needs, but I don't recognize. Is there a way to tag all of the files that are required by the system, so I can ignore them while cleaning up storage? I'm thinking in terms of a program or some code you may have made/come across.\nCurrently using MacOS Sierra version 10.12.4\n\nA: macOS Sierra comes with SIP (System Integrity Protection) which protects all important files from getting removed. So an additional tagging is not really necessary. \nIn finding disk space hogs some of the answers to How can I figure out what's slowly eating my HD space? might be helpful.\n", "Q: Change Font Size of entered text on PDF in Preview 9.0 I've read several similar questions but they appear to be outdated.  Many mentioned a \"show fonts\" option in the \"Tools\" menu which does not exist.  Others mention a couple ways to show the markup toolbar, which does include a font formatting option, but changing these options does absolutely nothing to the text I'm entering. I've tried highlighting existing entered text and modifying the values, and I've tried changing the values before entering new text. Nothing seems to be working, and my text is far too large to fit on the field I'm trying to fill out.\nAny other ways of changing the font size that I'm not seeing? Is this maybe a bug with this version that'll be patched soon? \nThanks.\n\nA: In the markup toolbar, all you have to do is add a text box and then any text will be customizable using the text formatting options\n\n", "Q: 9,93 GB of 5 GB iCloud storage taken up by Docs - how to find an delete them? How is that possible?\nHow can I locate these files and remove them?\nI cannot locate them neither through the iOS Settings nor at https://www.icloud.com/.\nAll I am using iCloud for is creating a backup with only a small number of applications included and it is usually smaller than 2 GB.\n\n\nA: I was unable to solve the problem myself, so I contacted Apple Support. During a phone call, I was explained that the space was taken by temporary, hidden files like incomplete backups. \nI couldn't delete these myself and the technician did that for me. \n", "Q: USB-C Wall Charger with data ports I have a new MacbookPro with only USB-C ports. Does there exist a wall charger for USB-C that can provide the appropriate power while also providing a sort of built in dongle for USB and an SD card reader?  I am looking for something like the below image, where the extra USB ports also provide data to my mac when plugged in via USB-C. Does such a product exist? I would never need to remember to bring another dongle again, just bring my wall charger.\n\n\nA: Nothing in a very convenient form factor like that or that include an SD Card Reader. There are some good USB-C Docks that provide connectivity and charging Kensington SD4600P USB-C Docking Station or CalDigit USB-C Docking Station but they may not be quite what you're looking for.\n", "Q: How do you specify the type of file you're looking for in an 'open file' dialog with a pattern? On every other operating system except MacOS, when you bring up an Open File dialog, you can type (for example) *.txt or even *recipe*.txt to narrow down the list shown on the screen. \nOn MacOS, there's just a predefined list of filename extensions that you can choose from, but I don't see anywhere to type a file match pattern myself. I want to filter by the whole filename, not just the extension. How do I enable this very basic feature that I take for granted on both Windows and Linux?\n\nA: You have Spotlight available from every file-picker dialog.\n\nYou can search by name or extension/file type, either in the currently open directory or the entire machine.\n\nSidebar hidden to save unnecessary extraneous detail\nIf you know the name rather than the filetype of the document you are looking for, then, same as in any Finder folder, you can start to type the name & the selection will jump to the first match for that string.\neg typing t,e,s will find the first match on test.txt, but you can't use this to find a file type .xml etc as it only searches from the beginning of the name.  \n\n\nA: Following the example screens provided by Tetsujin, immediately prior to entering text in search area, it would be possible to use the Finder menu to Go : Go to Folder... and then enter /tmp in the dialogue box shown. Thereafter entering text in the Search field should find the files of interest.\n\n\nA: Here is an example using a standard Open dialog, specifying text files which are really just any non-binary files, and then doing a contains search so you're not limited to prefixes.\n\n\nUpdate\nThe above doesn't work in /tmp because Spotlight doesn't index hidden folders.  So just use grep at the command line.\n\n\nA: The answer is that only partial functionality is available via Spotlight. If the file you're looking for is anywhere in the Unix-style directories such as /tmp, /etc, /usr, /var, etc, Apple's Open dialog is just broken and you simply cannot filter your view of the files there except by a predetermined set of file extensions.\n\nA: You can access any folder from any file dialog box by pressing cmd-shift-g and entering the directory path.  This is the same as \"Go to folder...\" in the Finder.  Then enter your search parameters in the search box.\n\n", "Q: What's causing kernel panic on mid 2011 iMac? (a freed zone element has been modified) I've got a mid 2011 iMac that kernel panics roughly after 30 to 45mins of being powered on. Then the panics seem to get worst eg after every restart of the imac.\nI've tried x2 different boot drives both using OS X 10.10.5 as the base system, one being a USB drive and other being a thunderbolt drive.\nAt the moment my theories are it's more of a hardware problem then software, either ram or possible gpu. \nSee screenshot of report below:\n\n\nA: This turned out to be one piece of bad ram installed in the iMac.\n", "Q: Is it possible to configure an iOS device to remember credentials for a Wifi SSID but NOT auto-join it? I want to: \n\n\n*\n\n*leave Wifi enabled on the device\n\n*Make iOS remember the password for SSID A (e.g. Private corporate network)\n\n*Make iOS never connect to SSID A silently\n\n\nThis allows the following flow: \n\n\n*Manually connect to SSID A from the Wifi menu\n\n*Upon disconnecting from SSID A, require step 4 prior to re-connecting to SSID A\n\n\nExample: By default, upon entering the range of SSID A, using the iOS device continues to use either built in cellular or SSID B. After step 4 above and until the end of the day, the device will be on the network. \nFor now the workarounds are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Switch Wifi off when at work. Failure point: Forget to do it in the morning, leading to use of the network when not intending to. Further cons: consumes LTE bandwidth unnecessarily, and disables Wifi (which would disable e.g. tethering)\n\n*Forget SSID A in the menu. Dealbreaking pain point: have to use a clipboard manager or other insecure tools or brain power to restore the password for SSID A when actually required to connect.\n\n\nA: There's isn't a great solution but one possible workaround is to set SSID A to use a non routing static IP and just switch it back to DHCP whenever you actually want to use it. Just click the circled i to the right of the network name and click the Static toggle.\nYou'll need to enter a valid (but non functional) static IP and Subnet Mask (I tested with 10.1.1.1 and 255.0.0.0) or it won't keep the static IP setting. This let's you keep wifi on all the time and never enter your password again.\n\nA: So it seems like my phone (i now have an iPhone X) now provides an 'Auto-Join' option for a wifi network.\nSo just switching this to off should in theory implement what I want (a saved network that will not get auto-joined).\n", "Q: Is it possible to configure wifi to disconnect more aggressively when the signal is weak? Something that I notice a lot is my iOS device remains connected to the home network when in the backyard parking lot, about to leave the house. The router is on the other side of the house. \nThe LTE reception in the back yard is very good. The Wifi connection is weak and causes navigation apps to exhibit poor network performance.\nDesired behavior: Poor network conditions are detected and wifi connection is dropped in order to enhance application performance.\nUnsatisfactory workaround: Install network access point near the back yard. This is not a satisfactory solution because all this does is change the geometry of which areas near the house exhibit poor application behavior on account of wifi remaining in range but yielding poor throughput. The goal would be to eliminate the poor behavior happening within these regions, rather than changing the geometry of these regions.\nAnother parallel to this is what happens when a network is not configured properly and your phone connects on Wifi but gets a 169.254.x.x link-local address when DHCP fails. I don't currently have a good overview of how Apple is handling this on iOS, but it obviously needs to fallback to cellular promptly. \n\nA: There is a setting in iOS in Settings > General > Cellular -> Wi-Fi Assist, which uses the cellular data when wifi is bad.\nHowever, this is on by default, so it may not be helping in your particular case. \n", "Q: Previews and Masters in Photos Library After recently recovering my Photos library on MacOS I found another backup that contained the same master files but different preview files. Everything in the other backups's Masters folder were duplicates of my recovered files, but the previews were different, including in some cases larger versions of the masters.\nMy question is this. Is Previews generated from Masters in some manner that would allow me to ignore it if I believe I have all of the master files?\nMore broadly, what directories contain files that are absolutely necessary to make sure I don't lose any original photos? I don't care if I lose album data, face info or modifications to files.\nOS: 10.12.4, Photos: 2.0 \n\nA: The contents of the Masters folder should be the basis for the Previews folder, I'm pretty sure the differences come from what computer or OS version the previews are generated in (retina vs non-retina making the most difference).\nI think it only regenerates them when they already exist if you move a library to a retina computer from a non-retina computer using migration assistant or time machine (my Library was a little larger storage usage wise and thats what I put it down to at the time), and since El Capitan my non-retina Mac (a Mini) has been making bigger previews then it used to as well.\nIf all you really care about if making sure you have your originals, the Masters folder is all you need to keep backed up. In MUCH earlier versions of iPhoto, the Masters folder used to be called Originals, which made a tad more sense :P\nAll a little Anecdotal, I'm sorry, but I mess with iPhoto and now Photos libraries quite a bit.

Preferably, if the pdf gets changed on my office computer, I should see the changes without refreshing the command.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: Take a look at SSHFS. This allows you to mount a filesystem over ssh. There's a good tutorial here.\nEssentially, you will mount the filesystem from your office computer and it will appear as a mounted volume on your mac. Instead of file accesses reading/writing to a local disk, they read/write across the ssh connection to the disk on your office computer.\nSince it's a mounted volume, all the local mac commands to open files work with native associated applications as you would expect. (e.g. in Terminal : open somefile.pdf)\n", "Q: MBP 2013 keyboard & trackpad freeze after USB disconnect while sleeping MacBook Pro 2013 retina. Sometimes I plug my phone into one of the USB ports to charge it. Sometimes I close the MBP and let the phone keep charging. Sometimes I then unplug the phone without waking up the MBP. Sometimes (not always -- just intermittently) when I do open the MBP again after this sequence, the keyboard and trackpad no longer work. An external mouse still works fine. But no combination of switching plugs, re-attaching the phone, sleep/wake, will get me the use of the keyboard again. I'm stuck at the screen saver login page with nothing but an external mouse (can't type password, no option to shut down cleanly). I have to force shutdown by holding down the power button, which is not ideal.\nDoes anybody know a way to un-wedge at this point or re-enable the trackpad + keyboard? I'd love to be able to just get back to work again, or at the very least do a clean logout and shutdown without a force reset.\n\nA: Workaround\nWhen you find yourself in this situation, you should be able to just briefly press the power button. Just a quick half-second press. In doing so you'll be prompted to restart, shutdown, etc.\nPotential fix\nIt may be worth you resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) to see whether this resolves the issue in the longer term.\nTo do this on your model of MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nSome tests\nHave you tested to see whether this behaviour is replicated on all USB ports?\nAnother test would be to boot into Safe Mode and see if it is replicated, either during Safe Mode or again afterwards. I understand it's an intermittent issue, so these sorts of tests will require determination/patience.\nTo boot into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Try testing for the same behaviour\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n", "Q: 2016 Macbook keyboard key barely working I have a new Macbook 2016 and the space bar has been acting up. If I smash it down hard enough I can get the space character to appear but that's not very practical.\nI read the Macbook marketing page (https://www.apple.com/macbook/design/) to confirm that they did change the design (since the keys feel noticeably different from years past). It seems to have had to opposite consequence from their intention in that the edge of my spacebar (right where my right thumb sits) doesn't really work but the middle is fine. \nI tried to blow into the keyboard and I also turned the laptop upside down and pressed the keys to maybe get rid of any crumbs.\nAre there any solutions to this? Should I risk taking the space bar off and checking out their new 'butterfly' design to see if I can fix it?\n\nA: That is obviously a hardware issue on your specific device (maybe some other devices of the same series are concerned).\nThe best thing to do is to contact the Apple assistance (online or via a physical Apple Store) and see what they can do.\nIf you take the space bar off, you'll probably lose your warranty.\n", "Q: How can I explain the value of the Secure Enclave / (TPM chip) to a privacy conscious user? The Apple Secure Enclave offers many opportunities for privacy and security.  Credit card information, Private keys with specific I/O functions (the private data is never exposed), PII, etc are all protected.\nQuestion\n\n\n*\n\n*Has Apple found a way to describe, illustrate, or educate an end user on why this is valuable? \n\n\nAs a techie, I jumped to the iPhones with the Secure Enclave, but I think people are understanding it.  (Some users said it sounded like \"enslave\" and that explained their initial bias against it\n\nA: Well, Apple has explained the Secure Enclave in various communications. How well the value of the Secure Enclave itself gets across to an end user is debatable and obviously a matter of opinion.\nMost end users probably aren't really that interested, they just take it for granted that \"it's all good\". And Apple has achieved that for the overwhelming majority of users - not just via their communications, but also their actions (e.g. taking on the FBI in court). \nAs for those end users who are more interested in the technical side of things, how many of them actually understand the Secure Enclave is another question - but I guess that's what you're trying to get at. :)\nIn terms of end users, Apple's primary communication channel is their website. Many of the pages on their website explain the benefits of the Secure Enclave without getting too technical or even mentioning it. For example these pages (Manage your privacy, macOS Security) mention it, while the Approach to privacy page does not. But all indirectly explain the benefits of it.\nIn addition to the above, most of their individual product pages will reference and/or link to info regarding security features, privacy, etc. So, for example, a user interested in buying the iPhone 7 will eventually come across the following quote:\n\nProtecting Your Data\nPrivacy and security are at the core of everything we believe. And\n  everything we make.\nAt Apple, protecting your information is something we build into our\n  processes from the beginning. When we have an idea for a product, we\n  find a way to make it that ensures your security and privacy. It’s a\n  value we’re deeply committed to because your trust means everything to\n  us. Learn more about Apple's approach to privacy >\n\nAs you can see, it's written for the masses in an easy to understand and re-assuring way, without getting technical or even mentioning the Secure Enclave.\nThe most in-depth information from Apple directly about the Secure Enclave is found in the iOS Security Guide (which is updated regularly), although this is not really geared toward consumer end users.\nAnd of course, various Apple keynotes and patents refer to the Secure Enclave as well.\nAs an aside, you may find what Brian Roemmele had to say about the Secure Enclave interesting.\n", "Q: In AppleScript, what is the easiest way to remove all punctuation from a string? I have an Automator Service that is comprised of a single \"Run AppleScript\" action. The Service receives selected text in any application. \nThe Service incorporates this selected text into a pre-determined URL format. The Service then opens the newly-assembled URL in a new tab in a web browser window.\nHere is a string that the Service might receive:\n\nMy Plant's Dead! (But, Who Cares? I Have 12 Plants.)\n\nI want to use AppleScript to remove every and any punctuation symbol that exists in the string, including spaces. I also need the string to be converted to all lowercase characters. Numbers should not be removed from the string.\nSo, the desired string is:\nmyplantsdeadbutwhocaresihave12plants\n\nI understand that I can accomplish the desired effect by writing an individual text item delimiters statement for every possible punctuation symbol and for 26 uppercase letters. I could use a replace_characters sub-routine to make this method a bit neater.\nIs there an easier or shorter way to accomplish this effect in AppleScript, as opposed to using dozens of text item delimiters blocks? Such as, one line of code that reduces a string to letters?\nI know that other programming languages have a \"strip punctuation\" shortcut, which is why I ask.\nThis is, essentially, an AppleScript-specific \"Code Golf\" question.\n\nA: Try the following:\nset stringToConvert to \"My Plant's Dead! (But, Who Cares? I Have 12 Plants.)\"\nset returnedString to do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of stringToConvert & \" | tr -dc '[:alnum:]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'\"\n\nIt returns: myplantsdeadbutwhocaresihave12plants\ntr commands explained:\n\n\n*\n\n*tr -dc '[:alnum:]' deletes all non alphanumeric characters (including white space).\n\n*tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' converts all upper-case characters to lower-case characters.\n\n\nSee the man page for tr.\n", "Q: 2009 MacBook Pro 15 inch display upgrade I love my current 2009 15 inch MBP but I'm looking to upgrade the display. My understanding is that I cannot upgrade to a retina but is it possible to upgrade to a higher resolution than the current screen? I do a lot photo editing and would love to have a little better screen. I'm not looking to upgrade to a new MBP. I already have a new 27in mac that I use for editing but thats in my office. When I'm home and just looking to edit a few photos it would be nice to be able to use my MBP. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!! \n\nA: This is not going to be possible. Each display is not just a display, it's an entire display module and the whole module needs to be compatible (e.g. cabling connector and length, hinges, etc).\nYou could get more than the native 1440x900 resolution by using an external monitor (up to 2560x1600), but I'm sure you'd already know that.\n", "Q: Using AppleCare before it runs out I have a first generation Apple Watch Sport with some minor cosmetic imperfections and scratches after two years of use, with Apple Care+.\nThe support runs out soon, and I was wondering what use it the cover has. \nSpecifically: If I were to 'accidentally' 'drop' my Watch, could I claim that on Apple Care and get a brand new one, or at least screen?\n\nA: The hardware accidental damage coverage is only good for 2 incidents over the life of the AppleCare+.  Each incident is subject to a US$69 service fee + tax.  \nYou don't have to accidentally drop your Watch, you can just tell them that the glass was accidentally damaged during normal use and you want to make a claim (assuming you haven't already made at least 2 damage claims so far).  You'll be charged a service fee and they'll either repair the glass or provide you with a refurb Sport watch.\nThere should be no need for moral quandaries while doing this.  You bought the coverage to help you for this very purpose. \n\nA: I was in an Apple Store before XMAS to buy an Apple Watch and the salesman sold me on Apple Care + saying I would be covered in the event of damaging the glass. So yes you could do that, but only you would know if you can live with doing so.\n\nA: When you bought Apple Care+ with your Apple Watch, you have an 2 year extended warranty. Regarding the hardware, the coverage is for the following:\n1. Your Apple Watch\n2. The battery (if below 80% charging of original capacity)\n3. Accessories\nWithin the 2 years that you have Apple Care, it is possible to replace your Apple Watch for $69 (Apple Watch/ Apple Watch Nike+) or $79 (Apple Watch Edition/Hermes)\nKeep in mind that if you send in your Apple Watch for repairs, it is possible that you will get a brand new one, but it's more likely that you will get a refurbished device.\nA refurbished device has a brand new case, screen and battery. Other components could be used before in another Apple Watch. A refurbished device does undergo additional quality checks. (I'm not 100% sure if this is true for Apple Watch, but this is the case for a refurbished iPhone).\nService fees may vary for your country. See Apple Care+ for Apple Watch support page (US)\n", "Q: iPhone 6 Battery Expanding I have an iPhone 6, without Apple Care.\nA few months ago I noticed it got unbelievably, incredibly hot during use, both on and off the charger. It would also use the battery quite fast, up to 2% a minute sometimes, and would often be completely depleted by midday from a full charge, after it being in my pocket at school with time and social media checks being the only use. It also was in mint condition, having lived in a Lifeproof case for its entire life. \nHowever, I noticed the case started to bulge just underneath the left volume button on the side, pushing outwards slightly. Could this be a battery problem? Apple Support told me my battery health was fine (90%), so I should go to an Apple Store to get it looked at. As the closest store is 4 hours away, could anyone tell me if this is battery related or not?\n\nA: If by Could this be a battery problem? you want to know whether it's where the battery is located inside the phone, then the answer is yes. \nIn an iPhone 6 the battery is located at left-centre of the device (i.e. if you're facing it with the home button at the bottom). I should mention that the top of the battery is roughly in line with the bottom of the mute switch, so it is quite possible that the battery could be the problem. However, it's impossible for us to say since we can't physically inspect it. \nYou really need to get it checked out, but make sure you make a full backup first!\n", "Q: Printing 2 pages per sheet results in 4 pages Every now and then, I use the \"Layout\" option in macOS's print dialog to fit two pages on a sheet, for instance when printing presentation slides. For some reason, this sometimes leads to 4 pages being printed per sheet, rendering the slides hardly readable. Happened twice to me today.\n\nDoes anyone know why this is happening and how to prevent it?\nUpdate\nIn response to Tetsujin's comment:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm running the latest macOS Sierra 10.12.4 (16E195) but I've been experiencing this issue with previous versions of macOS (formerly OS X) as well so I don't think it matters.\n\n*I print from Preview and Safari and the problem occurs in both cases.\n\n*I usually print two A5s onto one A4.

For some reason certain applications ignore the request and just stay the same size (Adobe products consistently ignore it). You can read the script here, I got this from somewhere else (a stackoverflow post). Why might the script not work for certain windows and how could I possibly fix it?\n\nA: Since you've referenced Adobe products (and Photoshop specifically) in your question/comments, I'll refer to those here.\nThere is really nothing inherently wrong with the script - it's just that some apps are designed to work differently. Below are some considerations using Adobe Photoshop as an example:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you open an image, Photoshop will ensure it's initial state is at a zoom percentage that allows the user to see the whole image. \n\n*Now, if you manually click on the Zoom button (i.e. the little green circle at top left of the window) you will observe how Photoshop works with this button. It's typically not very helpful in the case of Photoshop, and it behaves differently to most other apps. This is because Photoshop has multiple windows (e.g. you want the script to work so that it maximises a window while keeping the top bar & task bar, but Photoshop has other windows on screen such as Tools) so the Zoom button only applies to the image window.\n\n*The only way to essentially change the view of the image in Photoshop is to use the View menu or shortcuts like ⌘0, ⌘1, ⌘+ or ⌘-.\n\n*Photoshop also uses a tabbed window view by default (i.e. as you open more images, Photoshop opens these in separate tabs within the same window).\n\n*You may be able to achieve the view you're wanting in Photoshop by changing the Screen Mode (go to View > Screen Mode).\n\n\nSo, I guess what I'm saying is that many applications use multiple windows (or panels). With Photoshop most users will have the Tools panel, the Layers panel, and so on open while using the app. It's the same for most of Adobe's apps and most other creative apps.\nYou may be able to achieve what you want with a specific script. And you may find the Adobe Photoshop CS6 Scripting Guide a handy reference.\n", "Q: Any way to copy message body from Apple Mail keeping quoted line prefix (\">\")? When I copy the body of messages in Apple Mail and paste to the text editor or web textarea, quoted line prefixs ('>') is alwasy lost.

In the resulting window I can scroll to find the part of the message I want, and select the text I want to copy.  I just tested this on two messages from my Sent mailbox, one with Rich Text, one without.\nBlank quoted lines seem to get an '=20' escape, so you'd want to do a search and replace after pasting.  It might not be too hard to make an AppleScript or Automator thing to help with this.  \nWith an older version of Mail you might find the Raw Source command in a different menu, I seem to remember.  \n", "Q: how to draw good safari button icons?

Today it was mds (indexing Spotlight) but one other time it was the core kernel process (PID 0).\nGoogling suggests that occasionally the machine demands more power than the outlet can provide and borrows from the battery. If this is the case I think it is great failing that this technique does not disable itself once the battery goes into the red. \nIs there anything I can do?\n\nA: First of all let me address the following:\n\nGoogling suggests that occasionally the machine demands more power\n  than the outlet can provide and borrows from the battery.\n\nThis is plain and simply false. Ignore this altogether.\nNow, what almost certainly must be happening is that for some reason the MacBook is not receiving power from the charger and therefore is forced to rely on the battery instead. To clarify, what I mean is that the MacBook is drawing its power from the battery just like it would if there was a blackout, the charger was unplugged, and so on.\nThis indicates that you may have a faulty charger or charging cable, a faulty I/O board, or in the worst case scenario a faulty logic board.\nThe first thing I would try is to reset the System Management Controller (SMC).\nReset the SMC\nTo reset the SMC in a MacBook Air, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your Mac back on with the power button.\n\n\nNow use your MBA as normal and see if the problem returns. If so, I would be regularly keeping an eye on the charging indicator (it should always show either a green or amber light). No light means it's not delivering any power whatsoever which, assuming the mains is on and there's no blackout, indicates a hardware problem. A constant amber light (i.e. one that never goes green) also indicates a problem, usually with the battery but not always.\nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYou can also test you Mac's main hardware components. To do this your model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\n", "Q: Extremely Smart Calendar app needed! Does anyone know of a calendar app that could handle a bunch of iCal events, each dependent on their timing for the placing of the final one, so that the final date could be copied and moved and all the others would stay the same distance apart?\nFor example I might have an irregularly recurring event which is a concert. Two days before that I need to hold a rehearsal and book a hall three weeks before the rehearsal. Five days before the rehearsal I need to have all the music notated and send it out to the performers. At least a fortnight before that, on the nearest Monday afternoon, I need my calendar app to invite my performers to take part and then report back to me whether or not they are available. I then have to start notating music to suit the line-up I can get. I need to allow 50 hours of free time to do this task, so it needs to slot in with spare time I have from other events I might be managing.\nHaving spent hours setting all that up once I wouldn't want to do it again. I would like an app that can take all that and call it one event which can be kept in a library and assigned with the final event to any date of my choosing. It would then work out everything else backwards and tell me when I need to do all the tasks on my calendar. \nDoes anything like that exist?\n\nA: Plenty of Calendar apps, such as Fantastical, can parse your needs with natural language, but I am not aware of any that can string together all your events as you have stated. \nHowever, you can certainly do this with Automator/AppleScript and iCal. There are many resources on the web that will give you instructions and snippets that you can string together with Automator without any programming knowledge. Many of those scripts can be found here on AskDifferent.\n", "Q: Change .jpg quality of terminal screenshots I’m using a terminal script to capture my screen at set intervals.

I want to turn off my MacBook's Wi-Fi automatically when closing its lid.\nIs there any software can do this?\nI have a battery drain problem.  When Wi-Fi is enabled and I close the lid, my MacBook will periodically wake overnight, draining battery.\nI have done ton of research and tried many methods.  Turning off the Wi-Fi before closing the lid is the only way to guarantee that my MacBook will not wake.  But, well, it is annoying to disable Wi-Fi every time.  So I need a script or other software to do this job.  \n\nA: You could combine DFGKApps's script for turning off Wifi and DssW's Power Manager to run the script on sleep.\nThe Terminal.app command to disable WiFi appears to be:\n networksetup -setairportpower en1 off\n\nTo re-enable WiFi use:\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en1 on\n\nBe sure to test these commands using Terminal.app, as I suspect they may require tweaking depending on your network set up.\nBe aware that running a script on sleep does come with limitations. The time available for the script is short and can not be extended.\nI am a software engineer involved with Power Manager, so feel free to ask technical questions about how to use it.\n\nA: Have you tried your Energy Saver preferences?\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Click on \"Energy Saver\"\n\n*On the \"Battery\" tab, make sure \"Enable Power Nap while on battery power\" is unchecked. That should stop it from checking emails while in sleep mode.\n\n*While you're at it, if you don't want it to connect to WiFi at all while sleeping, go to \"Power Adapter\" and uncheck \"Wake for Wi-Fi network access\" and \"Enable Power Nap\" there too.\n\n*To further save power, you could also (on the Battery tab) check \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\". That should help with battery drain - but it's unrelated to WiF-i.\n\n\nYou may have found and discounted that solution already, but if you let us know what other solutions you've tried, it might help to pin it down.\n", "Q: Post data to url using AppleScript I am trying to take user input and send the data to a url on my site to do some checks against my database.

The only thing that matters, is having Time Machine first create the Sparse Bundle on the Time Capsule.\nIn other words, the instructions from #104277 can be followed, even in case the Time Machine backup originated from a case-sensitive file system.\nI however can't rule out that it worked only because there were no case insensitive file/folder name collisions in the first place (e.g., no distinct files named 'file', 'File' and 'FILE' in the same origin folder).\n", "Q: Strange virtual disk. Delete or leave? I have two virtual disks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Main macOS disk\n\n*Bootcamp windows disk\n\n\nWhen I use diskutil listin command line, it shows me:\n\nSo what the /dev/disk1 is? Should I delete it? And what is EFI EFI disk0s1 is?\nP.S. No fusion drive, only one SSD physical drive.\n\nA: *\n\n*The internal virtual disk is a Logical Volume and part of a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group. CoreStorage itself is a logical volume manager similar to Linux' LVM. An LVM is an additional abstraction layer in between hard disks and partitions on one side and volumes on the other side.\nIn macOS you can convert a partition (e.g disk0s2) with a HFS+ file system lossless to a Logical Volume Group which initially contains several nested items: a Physical Volume, a Logical Volume Family and a Logical Volume. The final Logical Volume is slightly smaller than the original partition, because CoreStorage needs some space to save administrative data.\nThe Logical Volume contains the data of the previous standard volume/partition and is mapped to its own (virtual) disk device: disk0s2 > disk1\n\n*EFI system partition - Usage - macOS:\n\nOn Macintosh computers based on Apple–Intel architecture, the EFI system partition is initially left blank and unused for booting. However, the EFI system partition is used as a staging area for firmware updates.\n\nNone should be deleted!\n\nA: It's your macOS partition, the physical partition at /dev/disk0s2. i.e. the physical partition /dev/disk0s2 is the virtual disk /dev/disk1. You can confirm that by running mount in Terminal (or similar) - it should show /dev/disk1 mounted as /, e.g.:\n/dev/disk1 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\n\nAnd do not delete it!\nEFI is, if I understand correctly, the boot partition.\n", "Q: Calls from my iPhone to friend's iPhone always go to voicemail, and he never gets my texts anymore EDIT: For others with the same problem: Phong was right, my friend had actually inadvertently blocked me.\nI have an iPhone 6s and my friend has maybe the 6 or 5, but definitely an iPhone as well.\nWe used to receive each other's calls and texts no problem. Starting about a week ago though, he stopped receiving any of my texts but I still get all of his.\nAlso, any time I call him my calls go directly to his voicemail without ringing (and we tried enough times to make sure that his phone was on and should've rung) but he can call me just fine and my phone will ring.\nI'm not having this problem with anyone else as far as I can tell (my gf and other friends get my texts and I can call other numbers).\nOne thing is that when I text this friend, I never see \"Delivered\" under the text.\n\nA: Sounds like your friend may have blocked you accidentally. Have him open your contact card, and scroll to the bottom. If he did in fact block you, he will see a button to Unblock this caller.\nBlocking requires no confirmation, and that button is present at the bottom of every contact card, so it’s easy to tap on accident.\n", "Q: Apple Mail won't delete messages Lately I have problems deleting messages in Apple Mail (Mac OS 10.11).\nI select one or multiple messages, hit delete key and get an error saying that these messages have already been \"deleted\" (moved to the trash folder in Mail): that's not true, the trash folder is empty and I'm stuck with the problem.\nWhat should I do?

If that tab is on a website that requires an active connection to its server, such as chat apps (Slack, Google Talk, etc.), then that app will disconnect from the server.  Most of them will show you a brief \"reconnecting\" or \"retrying\" message when you select that tab again.\nNot only this is annoying but it also causes that tab to not update or refresh constantly so I would miss a notification, if there is one, or even lose the session from the server requiring me to type my user credentials again. That happens very often with my company's e-mail web app.\nThis is not what the App Nap technology does.  I've already tried disabling that with\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAppSleepDisabled -bool YES  \n\nto no avail.\nIt isn't the \"Stop plug-ins to save power\" preference either, as that is disabled and those websites don't use plug-ins.\nDoes anyone have any tips?\nSafari 10.1\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.4\n\nA: I think the setting you’re looking for is Disable Hidden Page Timer Throttling, located under Debug → Miscellaneous Flags.\nIf you haven’t enabled the Safari Debug menu yet, triple-click the following line and paste it into a Terminal session:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1\nNow completely quit Safari, then reopen it.

Whenever I take a picture or video out my window, it always focuses on the screen instead of what I actually want to take a picture of. I can press on the screen to adjust the white levels, or press-hold to lock the auto-focus, but there doesn't appear to be any way to force it to focus far instead of near. How do I force the camera to focus on distant objects instead of the near screen?\niOS 10.3.1\n\nA: 2022.06.13 As of IOS 14.5, there is still no manual focus adjustment in the phone or tablet's native.Camera.app. Maybe there will never be.\nIt appears that to focus at a different distance, you can lock the point of focus by pressing and holding the screen with your finger on a certain, chosen point. If you want to focus on far-distance, aim the phone to include a far-distant point, lock that point, then re-compose the frame to include what you want.\nWhen it locks, the Camera app will lock the focus distance, exposure level, and color balance determined by the sensor - for the area around the lock-point. When you set the lock, you can manually bias the exposure + or - up to 8 f-stops from the exposure the camera has determined automatically. Do this using the slide-area to the right of the yellow focus-box that appears around your locked focus point.\nThe camera app does not include any other mechanism to modify focus when taking photos. The focus / exposure / white-balance locking has been available since at least IOS 12. As mentioned in the comments, it may be possible that a different camera app could set +/or lock focal-distance using software.\n", "Q: Profiles - maintaining programs on different profiles I'm currently reading a book, The Complete Privacy and Security Desk Reference; Vol. 1: Digital by Michael Bazzell and Justin Carroll.\nThey specify many different types of user accounts and insist that you create several for the different levels of security involved in utilizing each.\nI'm planning to follow their instructions to make multiple user profiles on my MacBook Pro for security purposes.  \nMy question is how would I go about keeping the programs downloaded to each user profile synched without leaving my chosen user profile?\nDo I always have to sign on to each profile and independently download separate programs or is there a system-wide utility for downloading and running programs?\n\nA: You can't have user profiles on macOS (at least not as such), but you can create different user accounts in System Preferences and use these for specific but different purposes (e.g. one account for gaming, one with all your personal documents, one for Internet access, one for your financial stuff, one account for system administration etc.). As long as you only give Administration privileges to the system administration account and apply tight control on data shared between the accounts this may work quite well.\nAs for applications, you usually install them in /Applications anyway which makes them available to all users. What probably would defeat the purpose of the whole endeavor though is to come up with an elaborate scheme to share user-specific configurations between accounts. So if you happen to use Numbers or Pages in several user accounts you will need to set preferences individually in each account.\nHaving said that, I doubt that macOS in its current form (with iCloud access more or less built-in in a lot of background stuff) really allows this kind of separation. The hassle of switching accounts all the time and of tightly controlling data exchange between them probably outweighs the gain in security (of course, keeping the Administrator separated from the everyday user account is always a good idea). \n", "Q: install binary file != move binary to path folder? What is the difference (is there any?) between sudo install -c -o %username% binaryfile usr/local/bin and just moving binary file to usr/local/bin?\n\nA: When you use install, it will copy a file to it's destination, while mv changes the directory listing and is atomic. When you move a file from one file system to another then mv is not atomic and will copy the file to the other file system then remove the source file. Obviously, mv and install have different options with install offering you more fine grain choices.\n", "Q: How to change the iPhone's audio output back to non-bluetooth? (internal speakers) At first I thought Pokemon Go is the only issue, but today I installed Clash of Clans and it is the same situation: the game audio will try to go out through the Bluetooth channel but since there is no bluetooth device around, it is all mute.\nIf I plug in the earbuds, then I can hear something for both Pokemon Go and Clash of Clans. The other way is: if I find and turn on a portable Bluetooth speaker, or if I go to the car and use the bluetooth there.\nBut there should be a way to make these app go out through the iPhone's internal speakers. How can it be done? (if I turn off Bluetooth on the iPhone, it doesn't solve the problem).\nP.S. the iPhone Music app doesn't have this problem. Only the apps do -- so I don't think it is apps' problem. I am using iOS 10.2.1 which is quite recent.\nP.P.S. just as a test, I just installed Angry Birds Rio, and it is exactly the same with Pokemon Go, Clash of Clans: no audio. So I don't think it is the apps' problem.\n\nA: This is a bit of a guess based on an assumption I am making (dangerous, I know). \nMy assumption is that when you're playing games such as Angry Birds Rio that the audio is not actually outputting via Bluetooth at all. \nInstead, I think the reason you do hear it when switching on a Bluetooth speaker is because at that point the iPhone starts outputting via Bluetooth. Prior to that, I think your iPhone is outputting via the iPhone's internal speakers but you're not hearing it because the volume level is not up for games. \nWhat I mean is that iPhones have multiple volume levels. For example, it is possible to have the ringer volume level all the way up while having the games audio level all the way down. \nAs a test, I would start playing one of the games and make sure the volume is turned up (and also that the mute switch is not on). If that solves the problem, great! If not, report back so I or others can dig deeper.\n\nA: Ok, I finally tracked down the reason. It is due to iPhone and iOS having this \"semi-mute\" mechanism.\nSo if you slide that mute button at the side of the phone at some point in the past, it is \"semi-mute\".  The alarm clock will still sound, the counter down timer will sound, YouTube will sound, Music app will sound, Video app (TV app) will sound, Facebook videos and live broadcast will sound, but games will not sound.\nWhy this exception, I am not so sure. Why should YouTube and Music app both give sound but when I switch to and run my favorite game, it should not give sound, I am not so sure.\n", "Q: Dead backlight on iMac, LCD and all else OK The screen on my (desktop, not laptop) iMac is not working .. the backlight only works sporadically.  \nIf I hold a flashlight up to the dead screen, I can see the pixels; the video is working, just not the backlight.\nI've connected a second display (it is mirrored; both show the same desktop), so I can still use the computer.\nThe interesting thing is that if the computer \"sleeps\", upon being woken up, the iMac's display works briefly for a fraction of a second, then it goes dark again.\nAccording to a sticker on the back of the panel, it uses CFL compact fluorescent lamps (not LEDs). The inverter is located on the mainboard (underneath the CD drive); the wires are soldered to that board.. the other ends are soldered directly to the CFL lamps.. but there are connectors in the middle of each wire.\nBTW, the capacitors on the inverter board look OK, I don't see any burn marks, or broken wires, or bad solder connections on that board.\nDoes this sound like a problem w/ the inverter board, or with the connectors in the middle of the wires that go to the lamps? \nEDIT: this is a 2008 iMac 20\" 2.66/2x2g/320/wm/wk\n\nA: Try to reduce the screen brightness to minimum.

You can lock it and mark it as lost on Find My iPhone. That way if/when it comes back online it will notify you and record its location.\nUnfortunately if the thief knows what they are doing, I doubt you will ever see your phone again.\n", "Q: Why is the System Preferences Dock icon showing a Badge? Today I noticed that the System Preferences icon in the Dock has a red badge (containing a white '1' digit).\n\nI presume the app or the computer is trying to tell me something, but I can't figure out what that is.  I tried opening the System Preferences app in the hope that it might badge or highlight the preference pane icon concerned, but everything looks normal.  \nI've tried clicking on several of the preference panes, but the badge stayed.  I suppose I might try clicking on every single one of them and see if or when the badge might go away, but I wonder if you might have seen something like this.  Another thing I haven't tried yet is to look in Console.\n\nA: I just had this. First result in Google search was here (Apple SE). The second result was Apple Support Communities which had the advice: \n\nOpen it up and see what preference pane it jumps to immediately. I think it wants you to sign up for two-factor authentication. You don't have to sign up, but you do have to either accept or reject two factor in order to clear the badge and restore functionality to System Preferences.\n\nFor me, it jumped to the iCloud pane which had a not-so-clear alert about two-factor authentication, which was the issue the badge in the dock was alerting me about.\n\nA: I clicked the iCloud pane, and found it was suggesting I improve my security posture.  When I did something about that, the badge went away.\nI did that only after I'd tried logging out and logging in again.  I guessed restarting the computer wouldn't change anything, so I didn't try it.\n", "Q: QuarkXPress crashes when opening one project I am having a problem with QuarkXPress 9.5.4.0 on an iMac running Mac OS X 10.11.6. \nThe problem is that whenever I try to open a particular project QuarkXPress crashes. I would normally have a backup, but I’ve only been working on this project since yesterday and haven’t got one.\nIs there anything I can do that will avoid losing everything I’ve done up to this point?\nPlease tell me if this is the wrong site for this question. I flipped a coin to pick between this one and the graphic design one. :)\n\nA: QuarkXPress has a built-in process for validating project files that you can use to try and repair any file inconsistencies. To do this follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch QuarkXPress\n\n*Go to File > Open (or press commandO)\n\n*Navigate to and select the project file you’re having a problem with, but do not click on Open yet\n\n*Now press and hold controlshiftoptioncommand\n\n*While still holding these keys down, click on the Open button\n\n\nYou should find that the project opens successfully without crashing QXP, but you may also find that your content has reflowed differently to how you had it originally. Now you should create a new version of the project by dragging the thumbnails from this one to a new one. See below for how to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Still in QXP, create a new project\n\n*Make sure the new project has the same layout and setup (such as facing pages or not) and also has the same number of pages\n\n*In each of the projects, go to View > Thumbnails\n\n*In each of the projects, go to Window > Tile and select either horizontal or vertical\n\n*Now, in your original project click the first page and hold down the shift key while you also click on the last page\n\n*Now drag the pages to your new project\n\n*Save your new project using a different name\n\n*Close both projects\n\n*Now try to reopen the new project you saved at Step 7\n\n\nAt this point, the best case scenario is that your new project opens without crashing QXP. If so, make a backup of it before working to get your design back to how you wanted.\nIf you can’t open the new project, then it’s likely the problem was a particular image, font, etc. If this is the case, follow Steps 1 to 9 again except at Steps 5 and 6 only drag one page across to the new project. If that works, then you know that page was fine, so repeat the steps to copy one page at a time and, as you do that, save your file using a different name each time. This way you’ll hopefully identify the page (or pages) that was causing the problem.\nI know there’s quite a bit in this answer to follow, so if you have any problems or I’ve not been very clear, let me know and I’ll try to help you further.\n", "Q: macOS sometimes can't connect to WiFi hotspot that's really working perfectly Every now and then, my Macbook Pro running the latest macOS won't connect to my WiFi. It just keeps insisting: The Wi-Fi network \"Ubiquiti UniFi\" can not be joined.\nThis happens both at home, and work, and on other random locations. It's only occasionally, it connects just fine most of the time. But when the problem shows up, no matter how often I retry to connect, the error keeps showing up. And then later that day (like a couple of hours later) it randomly connects by itself as if nothing is wrong.\nSomething I noticed: normally when connecting to a WiFi, the connection thingy in the top menu bar in macOS shows an animation with the bars in the WiFi icon lighting up one after another, like this:\n\nNow whenever this connection problem occurs, I noticed the bars do not light up. The animation doesn't happen, the entire icon just stays dim. It feels like it's not even trying to connect, but obviously that's just my interpretation from not seeing the icon animate. \nAlso whenever this happens and I try to connect with my phone (Android 7) or iPad (iOS 10) instead, it works fine all the time. So the WiFi access point itself is really working absolutely fine.\nAlso my signal isn't blocked or weak or anything, I'm literally sitting 2 meters away from the WiFi antenna, with no obstacles in between. And there's not a ton of other WiFi stations nearby that might be disturbing my channel (sometimes I see two or three other SSIDs in the list with weak signals, sometimes I see none).And there's not a ton of devices connected to the same network either. Usually just my laptop, sometimes also my phone or iPad, maybe a phone or laptop from my wife at home or colleague at work, but that's about it. \nI have even tried resetting my Mac's NVRAM and the SMC, unfortunately to no avail.\nAny suggestions what the hell could be causing this, or what I could do about this?\n\nA: It happened again twice since I posted this, and I think I found something that seems to work. On the terminal, I do:\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\n\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport --scan\n\n(that last command shows a list of available networks with their SSID)\nnetworksetup -setairportnetwork en0 MyWifiSSID MyWifiPassword\n\nBoth times this made my connection work again.\nHaven't tried Monomeeth's solution yet, but as it involves more manual interaction and rebooting my laptop, I hope the above 'on the fly' method will suffice.\n\nA: I would totally remove your Wi-Fi service, restart, and add your Wi-Fi service back.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Network\n\n*Select the Wi-Fi service on the left-hand side\n\n*Click on the cog icon at bottom-left and select Make Service Inactive\n\n*Now delete the service by clicking on the minus sign (i.e. the - button) at left of the cog\n\n*Click on the Apply button\n\n*Exit Network preferences\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Network\n\n*Click on the plus sign (i.e. the + button) at left of the cog\n\n*In the pop-up window, ensure that Wi-Fi is selected from the drop-down menu\n\n*Click on the Create button\n\n*Make sure Wi-Fi is on and connected (it should remember your previous settings, but if not just re-add your Wi-Fi network again)\n\n\nLet me know if this resolves the issue.\n", "Q: Activation lock problem I've recently dug out an old iPhone to sell.\nIt has activation lock on it which is pretty normal. However, it's linked to an Apple account which has had its password changed since then. I've also removed it from the iCloud interface.\nIt now refuses to unlock with either my current password or the password I used then... :(\nIs there anyway to reset this iphone without having to go through tech support?\n\nA: Since you removed that device from iCloud list of locked devices, just put the device in recovery mode and restore iOS from iTunes over USB. That wipes everything, including the cached old password. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263\nIf that fails, post a follow up with the details of the failure like error message. \nYou could also go through support if needed to prove if you are the original purchaser of the device. \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I bypass Activation Lock?\n", "Q: How can I copy application settings from one user account to the other on the same machine? I have two user accounts (a work and personal account) on my MacBook Pro 5,3 with OS X 10.11.6.\nOn both I use the same Logitech MX Master mouse in combination with the Logitech Options application.\nI would like to keep the settings (scroll speed, pointer speed, etc...) in sync such that I do not have to do the setup on each account.\nHow can I copy settings stored by an application (Logitech Options in this case) on one account to the other?\nAttempts\nI have looked in ~/Library/Application Support/Logitech/Options. There I find 4 .xml files. However, changing a setting in Logitech Options does not change the Date Modified of these files. Hence I think these files do not store the settings.\nI have also run lsof | grep -i logitech when Logitech Options is open. Unfortunately I only find files in my user directory related to the saved state of the application (~Library/Saved Application State/com.logitech.Logi-Options.savedState/). My understanding is that these relate to the window state of the application, not to the settings stored by it.\n\nA: Most, but not all, applications save some settings in a .plist file in ~/Library/Preferences.\nLook for and appropriately named file containing the name of the application in question.\nCopy this file to the same location under a different User's Home folder.\nNote that you may have to adjust permissions on the file for the other User Account to read/write to the file.\n\nA: You can backup your settings using Logi Options app and restore them from another computer.\n\n*\n\n*Log in or create your Logitech account\n\n*Select your device -> \"MORE\"\n\n*Choose \"Backups\" menu\n\n*Press \"CREATE BACKUP NOW\"\n\nAfter that you can restore settings on another computer from the same menu.\nNotice that settings are being restored for the selected device only; so e.g. if you have Logitech mouse and keyboard, you have to do this procedure for each of them.\n", "Q: Folder displaying in terminal but not finder Alright, so I just started beginning web development using my mac. My localhost says \"It works\" and I read somewhere I need to add my code files etc in Library/WebServer/Documents.\nHowever, inside my Library, I do not see any WebServer folder. I can only see WebKit.\nBut if I try to locate the folder with terminal, it exists right there inside /Library.\nWhat mystery is this? Please help me out.\n\nA: Mac OS has hidden folders within the depths of its hard drive. If you want to make these appear, you have to use the terminal.\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal.\n\n\n*Type the command defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE, then press Enter (Or Return)\n\n\n*Type the command killall Finder (make sure you do the capital F) and press Enter/Return.\nIf you ever want to turn this off, just repeat the commands above, substituting TRUE for FALSE.\n\nA: The default location for WebServer documents is /Library/WebServer/Documents, which is inside the Library folder in the hard disk's root. The WebKit folder you see is at ~/Library/, i.e. the current user's personal Library folder. That folder is hidden by default (if you go to the Home folder, ~, in Finder, by pressing Shift + Cmd + H, you'll either not see the Library folder at all, or it is slightly transparent).\nIn Finder, press Shift + Cmd + G and enter /Library/WebServer/Documents and you'll be where you need to be.\n\nA: The default storage location for web server documents is /Library/WebServer/Documents. You can open this directory without any problems if you enter this code in the terminal. You will then be taken straight to the directory.\nopen /Library/WebServer/Documents\n", "Q: Mac suddenly shuts down and doesn't respond My MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch Early 2013) has been crashing abruptly.

It goes blank and when I try to force restart using the long press on the power button, it doesn't boot up. I just leave my laptop alone for 10 minutes and then try force booting it up using the power button.

If so, then you'd want to run Apple Hardware Test.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Test the computer (i.e. use it, put it to sleep, try to replicate the crash)\n\n*To exit Safe Mode just restart your Mac as normal\n\n\nIf the problem persists in Safe Mode, then use Apple Hardware Test as follows.\nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYour model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\n", "Q: How to access an iPhone app's database and media files? How can I access the database of an iPhone app I have purchased to copy it to an Excel spreadsheet? And how can I access its media files to copy them to my hard drive?\n\nA: If the data does not show in iTunes File Sharing, you can use iExplorer to read your iTunes backup for the app’s container.\n\nA: Here are the steps that have solved my problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Database: Use iExplorer to create a backup of your iPhone. In iExplorer go to X/App - Y/Documents/ where X is the name of the backup folder and Y is the name of the app preceded by the name of the company that sells it. This folder contains an SQLite database file (with the extension .sqlite).\n\n*Media: Open iTunes on your iMac, make sure the app is downloaded (if not - download it), then browse in Finder to ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/. Copy the file Y.ipa to your desktop, where Y is the app's name. In the desktop change the file's extension to .zip. Extract the zip file. Search for the app executable, right-click and select Show Package Contents. All the media files are there.\nStep 1 was suggested by grgarside in his answer on the present thread.\nStep 2 was suggested by Kamil.S in his comments to this post from stackoverflow.\n", "Q: Temperature missing from Today widget A few days ago I noticed that the current temperature in the Today widget in Notification Center was wrong. The Weather widget said it was in the 70's, but the Today widget said it was currently in the 30's.\nI did some googling for solutions, and while I didn't find that specific problem, I found various suggestions to remove the widget and add it back. I did that, and now the Today widget simply doesn't show any temperature at all.\nI also tried the suggestion of unchecking and checking \"Weather\" in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Location Services.\nThe Today widget is in the Notification Center, and it has other information like upcoming calendar and reminder events, just not today's weather.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe weather information has returned to the Today widget.  I rebooted a couple of times over the weekend -- once because my battery ran out, and later because I was installing Security Update 2007-01; maybe that triggered it. However, I don't think the current weather is correct. It says it's mostly cloudy, but it's at least 90% clear, and the weather widget confirms that it's sunny. weather.com says Sunny, winds WNW 10-15 MPH, not NW 17 MPH. And it doesn't include the temperature at all in the Today widget, like it did before the original problem.\n\n\nA: I think I've found the problem. The weather in the Today widget is only correct if Location Services is able to determine the location, which only happens if I enable WiFi. I normally have WiFi disabled because I use an Ethernet connection to my router.\nTemporarily turning WiFi on fixes the weather in the Today widget. The Weather widget doesn't require this because you configure the city explicitly.\n", "Q: Is it safe to eject a hard drive during encryption? I am currently encrypting my external hard drive (1TB), but the process takes a while. I'm always using it on the go with my laptop, so I have to eject it at some point. However, after I eject my hard drive, the light on my hard drive is still on, indicating it's still active. I ejected it properly, but it still flashes on. So I decide to just shut down my laptop and plug out my hard drive.\nIs this safe to do?\n\nA: This is fine — if the disk has been ejected, it is no longer in use. I have done this myself during encryption of my Time Machine disk. Reconnecting the drive continues the encryption process from where it left off. Of course, make sure the disk is ejected before disconnecting it.\n", "Q: Is it free to forward text messages to your Mac? I hate logging in to my bank account from my Mac via 2 step and having my phone in the other room. I want to set up text message forwarding to my Mac, but I'm wondering if it comes with an extra charge. I understand that sending text messages from your Mac will cost you, but what about receiving?\nHow does the forwarding work exactly? Does it send an extra text message or does it redirect it via the internet?\n\nA: Text Message Forwarding works via iCloud on your iPhone and Mac. There is no 'extra' message being sent, however this will incur additional data usage if you are not on Wi-Fi.\nText Message Forwarding purely uses an internet connection, whether that be Wi-Fi or cellular data (if enabled). It does not use SMS to forward messages to your desktop. If you don't have an internet connection, the device will wait for network, then send the message to iCloud.\n", "Q: How do I get iWork / iMovie / Garage Band free of charge? Everything that I have read says that iWorks/ iMovie etc should be free for Mac users after 1 September 2013. \nI already bought Pages but want Numbers and iMovie. My MacBook Pro with retina is early 2015 and I am being charged.  \nWhy is this please?\n\nA: You probably purchased your MacBook Pro used, in which case the “free” downloads were redeemed to the original owner’s Apple ID. This would explain why you still had to pay for those apps.\nFortunately, starting April 18, 2017, Apple has made iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Numbers and Keynote free for everybody. This should take care of what was a very common source of confusion among customers.\n\nPreviously, all of these apps were provided for free to customers who purchased a new Mac or iOS device, but now that purchase is not required to get the software. \n\nHere are the direct App Store links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pages for macOS / iOS\n\n*Numbers macOS / iOS\n\n*Keynote for macOS / iOS\n\n*iMovie for macOS / iOS\n\n*GarageBand for macOS / iOS\n(Note: You sometimes need to provide a credit card or gift card balance to set up an Apple ID for Store use, even for “free” downloads.)\nIf you recently purchased those apps, you may be able to receive a refund by contacting Apple Support.\n\nA: I have a similar question. I bought my MBP in late 2011 but bought iWork then and updates were supposed to be free but it didn't want to give me the newer versions. I got around it by copying the apps from another newer Mac Mini, but we had a different Apple ID on that computer so I need to use that password to update the apps. But why did you buy Pages if it should be included for free?\nAccording to Cult of Mac you should be able to just download a trial of iWork 09 and then upgrade for free, but I don't know if that will work since owning iWork 09 didn't give me the upgrades. Apple really should just make the whole thing free since it's basically free except for odd cases where people lose their copy.\nAlso if you don't want to try the iWork trial or copying from another Mac and want to use iWork for free, you can use the web version on iCloud.com\n", "Q: How to stop MacBook Air desktop being shown on another computer on network I have recently upgraded all computers to macOS Sierra V10.12.4 and found to my surprise that my MacBook Air's desktop files and folders are being mirrored on another, more public, computer on the network.  To avoid embarrassment I want to stop this.  I cannot find a way to do it - any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: On the other computer that is public. Open iCloud preferences and turn of iCloud files. Consider signing out of iCloud entirely on that other computer.\nFor even more protection:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iCloud document sync on the source computer (or move the sensitive files to another folder that doesn't sync to iCloud). This eliminates the ability to access those files from iOS, though.\n\n*Store sensitive files in an encrypted DMG - they will still sync, but without a password to unlock the image - the files are not indexed or accessible.\n\n\nIn the future, Apple's new file system will allow file level encryption so that you can be less selective about sensitive files syncing but more selective about which are locked from inadvertent access (whether spotlight or just opening the file). This is probably 18 months off or more for total iOS / macOS adoption of APFS and file based encryption.\n", "Q: iTunes accidentally deleted on iMac G5 with OS X 10.4.11 - how to install iTunes? I accidentally deleted iTunes on my old iMac G5 running Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.11. It is not in the trash, and I would really like to get it back. I tried getting the latest version of iTunes available for my system from https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1056?locale=en_US. When I tried to open the DMG file it gave me, all I got was a notice that said \"The following disk images failed to mount: iTunes9.2.1.dmg\".\nGot any suggestions? I would really like to have iTunes back.\n\nA: Your downloaded DMG should work, but assuming you still have the Mac OS X Tiger install DVD you could try the following instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the Mac OS X Tiger install DVD\n\n*When Finder opens the Mac OS X Install DVD window, scroll down till you see the System folder\n\n*Navigate to System > Installation > Packages\n\n*Locate the iTunes.pkg and double-click on it\n\n*This should launch the iTunes installer\n\n*Follow the steps to see if you can install iTunes. \n\n\nAssuming you can, after doing so use the Apple > Software Update option to update it or launch iTunes and go to iTunes > Check for Updates option instead.\n", "Q: What's the quickest/easiest way to make a digital signature on an iPad? I need to scribble my signature on an electronic document. I see that Google Drawings has a scribble feature, but I can't get a mouse to produce anything that looks like my written signature.\n\nI can't seem to find this option in Google Drive for iOS (there's no \"New Drawing\" option). I'm not sure if it's buried in another app or if I can use it on the mobile website.\nI'm willing to try other methods, if they're readily available in iOS 10 (native feature, Apple apps, or something not requiring an account or registration).\n\nA: Email the document to yourself, then tap the icon of the attachment. When you do this, it should open, and a small toolbox should be in the top right hand corner. Tap it, and you may add a signature using the signature button at the bottom left corner. There are dedicated apps available on the App Store, like HelloSign. Furthermore, macOS \"Preview\" App also allows for the signing of documents, as does Adobe Reader DC. \nFor signing on Mac, follow instructions that may be found here, which basically says to click on the toolbox icon within preview, then the signature icon located in the menu that just dropped down. \nFootnotes:\n[1] The document must be a PDF and on iOS, it must be opened from the mail app.\n[2] The newest OS is recommended to perform these actions, but it is available on iOS 9 and later. And macOS must be 10.9 or above. \nBest of luck!\n", "Q: how to have holidays of different countries shown on OS X default app? I have US holidays and in the settings there is Chinese calendar too. But I want to have holidays of a few different countries included in the calendar simultaneously. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: Apple has a website with all supported calendars.  You can download and install dozens of different types of calendars on your Mac.  \nSimply find the calendar you want to use, download it, and then install it into your calendar. If you sync your calendar with iCloud, these dates will also be added there.  If you don't know how to do that, see this Apple Support site for directions on how to add calendars.\nIf you have any iOS calendars that sync to this calendar, they will also be updated with the new dates.\n", "Q: Is it possible to backup an iPhone to both iCloud and iTunes? This question is generic but for my case I have an iPhone SE with iOS 10.3.1 and a MacBook Pro running Sierra 10.12.4.\nIs it possible to have my iPhone backup to both iTunes and iCloud? When I connect the phone to iTunes the backup option seems to have a radio option for one or the other.\nBut it seems it would be preferable to have backups in two different places, a more complete larger backup on the computer and a smaller backup to iCloud that has the settings/app list/documents.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible.\nThe options you're referring to in iTunes relate to automatic backups. You can achieve what you want by enabling iCloud backups (either in iTunes or in your iPhone's settings) and then manually doing a backup to iTunes whenever you want. \nTo do a manual backup to iTunes, simply connect the iPhone as you usually do with iTunes and then in the device's Summary screen within iTunes (the one with the backup options) you'll see to the right a Back Up Now button. Just click this whenever you want to also backup to iTunes.\n", "Q: Can't erase my phone I can't erase all content and settings on my iPhone 6s+.\nWhen I enter my passcode, restrictions PIN, and iCloud password it displays an error telling me that verification failed, there was an error connecting to iCloud. \nWhat's causing this and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Have you tried putting the phone in recovery mode and then unlocking the iCloud restriction afterwards? Hold down the sleep/wake and Home button until the iPhone goes into recovery mode and then erase it by connecting it to iTunes via a Lightning cable. Once the phone is erased it will require you to login to your iCloud account to unlock it.\n", "Q: How to save/load workspaces on El Capitan? I've noticed I'm using a few Finder and other app instances per project.\nSometimes I need to easily swap between \"workspaces\" and I've only recently started to use Mission Control and multiple Desktops which I'm getting the hang off.\nHowever, I noticed I use some workspaces more than others.\nI'd like to somehow save a list of Finder and other apps with their locations on screen to save resources, then restore the same layout at a later date when it's needed.\nIs this something that can already be done using El Capitan (preferably with built-in tools) ?\nIf so, how ?\n\nA: To assign a space to an application, you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate the space where you want the application to live...\n\n*Right click the application icon in the dock\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose: Options > Assign to: This Desktop\nThis will make it so that the application always opens to that space.\nApplications typically remember their window location, so as far as that goes, it should in most cases be just set it and forget it type of situation.\n\nIf you want multiple layouts, you might want to try out Moom. Not the only app that does that, but I'd say it's the best one I know. You can use it to save snapshots of  application locations that can be restored via menu or shortcuts.\nShould be noted that Moom doesn't control the application space, just the size and location.\n", "Q: 16GB DIMMs in 2010 Mac Pro I have a Mac Pro running dual Xeon X5675s (3.06 Ghz). I purchased 8 16GB PC3L-8500R DIMMs in the hope of upgrading it to 128GB. It sees all the memory, but it's only running it at 800 Mhz (PC3-8500 should run at 1066 Mhz). Is this a limitation of the amount of memory, or is it something about these DIMMMs that it doesn't like? I tried another CPU card (also with X5675s) and got the same result. With the original 4GB DIMMs, it runs at the expected speed.\nETA: I'm answering my own question. This is apparently a weakness of the architecture. If I remove the fourth DIMM from each bank, the memory runs at the correct speed.\n\nA: It can run 64GB as dual channel [8's] or 96GB as triple [16s].\nFrom EveryMac - Silver-Colored Mac Pro Q&A\n\nActual Maximum RAM\nAlthough \"Mid-2010\" and \"Mid-2012\" Mac Pro systems with a single\n  processor, which EveryMac.com notes as the \"Quad Core\" and \"Six Core\"\n  models, officially support a maximum of 16 GB of RAM, as discovered by\n  site sponsor Other World Computing, they actually can support more.\n  OWC first noted an actual maximum of 32 GB of RAM and later increased\n  this actual maximum to 48 GB of RAM.\nSystems with dual processors, which EveryMac.com notes as the \"Eight\n  Core\" and \"Twelve Core\" models, likewise officially support 32 GB of\n  RAM, but again, OWC found they actually can support more. OWC first\n  confirmed an actual maximum of 64 GB of RAM running Mac OS X 10.5\n  \"Leopard\" and later increased this maximum to 96 GB of RAM running Mac\n  OS X 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\" or higher. More recently, OWC yet again\n  discovered these dual processor models can support up to 128 GB, but\n  only when running a 64-bit version of Windows XP or later or Linux.\n  Mac OS X only can support 96 GB of RAM.\n\n", "Q: How to remove blank icon from launchpad after uninstall app? I have uninstalled an app from Finder->Applications. But in launchpad, icon of the app still exists.

Can't log in Dusting off an old iMac and it was hanging at 50% progress bar during start up.  Since I don't need anything on it I'm trying to reformat.  \nI've booted into recovery mode and erased the drive.  Then selected to install new OS.  Chose the drive (it's also showing a locked recovery drive).  By then it asks me to log into Apple Store.  I do and it's saying wrong password.  But then my phone asks for permission for login with my account.  I approve and it still doesn't let me in on the iMac.  Phone is giving an auth code but no where to enter it on iMac.  \n\nA: The version of the operating system of the recovery partition is probably lower than 10.11.0.\nAccording to Apple you have to append the auth code to the password then:\n\nWhat if I use two-factor authentication on a device running older software?\n  If you use two-factor authentication with devices running older OS versions, you might be asked to add your six-digit verification code to the end of your password when signing in. Get your verification code from a trusted device running iOS 9 and later or OS X El Capitan and later, or have it sent to your trusted phone number. Then type your password followed by the six-digit verification code directly into the password field.\n\n", "Q: Will it notify my mom if i turn my phone on? I got my phone taken away and i found it in my moms dresser turned off. She uses Find my Friends on me so will it notify her if i turn it on? She also pays the bill if that has anything to do with it.\n\nA: Potentially.\nIf your mom selected the 'notify when at this location' switch, your phone will notify her when it comes online at your house. It is highly unlikely that this is enabled, though.\nHowever, this will show your phone as online, so if she happens to check Find my Friends while your phone is turned on, she will be able to see it on the map.\n", "Q: Can I add custom pronunciations to \"Speech\"?

If you prefer a free way, then I recommend using TestDisk, an open source project that will help recover and perform sector by sector scan drives. \nI would just leave the drive plugged in and use one of the applications, if the drive is still able to spin (as I'm assuming it is because it will populate in disk util). In Disk Drill, you can click the settings icon beside your drive and click \"deep scan\". For a 4TB HDD, it takes around 3 days. It should be fine if left running for a few days, and eventually, it will allow you to mount your old drive, and transfer the files to a new drive.

When an auto-renewable subscription is due for renewal, does Apple notify the user ahead of time, via a notification or email? Or is their credit card charged without their knowledge?\nI'm considering using auto-renewable subscriptions in my app, so I want to understand this.\n\nA: Apple sends an email notifying the user about an upcoming auto-renewal about a month in advance.\n\nSOURCE: I use apps that auto-renew.\n\nA: Yes, Apple notifies the user about the upcoming renewal.  According to the Apple developer page that talks about subscriptions:\n\nAuto-renewable subscriptions give users access to content or services from within your app on an ongoing basis. At the end of each subscription duration, the subscription will automatically renew until a user chooses to cancel it\n\nIn your app you can also point the user to the Apple page that points to the subscription management part in iTunes.  This way the user can check on the status of all their subscriptions.\nWhile this isn't an extremely complicated process to understand, I wouldn't call it simple.  I've had to go thru several tutorials before I was able to understand it better.  Apple has a bunch of info on their Developer site, too.\nUpdated based on comments: That page links to several other developer pages.  Those pages indicate that Apple will try to auto-renew the subscription at the renewal date and will not prompt the user for additional input unless there's a problem (source):\n\nThe renewal process begins with a “preflight” check, starting ten days before the expiration date. During those ten days, the App Store checks for any issues that might delay or prevent the subscription from being automatically renewed—for example, if the customer no longer has an active payment method, if the product’s price increased since the user bought the subscription, or if the product is no longer available. The App Store notifies users of any issue so that they can resolve it before the subscription needs to renew, ensuring their subscription isn’t interrupted.\nDuring the 24-hour period before the subscription expires, the App Store starts trying to automatically renew it. The App Store makes several attempts to automatically renew the subscription over a period of time but eventually stops if there are too many failed attempts.\n\nAlso:\n\nThe user can also disable automatic renewal and intentionally let the subscription expire, then renew it at a later date, creating a longer lapse in the subscription. Make sure your app’s subscription logic can handle lapses of various durations correctly.\n\nMy reading of that info indicates that the app will automatically renew without user intervention if they have not turned off the automatic renewal feature.\n", "Q: Cancel iCloud subscription via browser on Windows?

Running the following command will switch Right Command and Right Alt (if you also want to do the Left Command and Left Alt, refer to the technical note to get the hex values and the Python code below to do the or operation).  \nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":\n    [{\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x7000000e7,\n      \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x7000000e6},\n     {\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x7000000e6,\n      \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x7000000e7}]\n}'\n\nThe table at the bottom of the Technical Note has a list of hex values for each key.  To generalize the above answer to switch any keys (at least is macOS Sierra), you must or the hex value from that list together with 0x700000000.  The following Python code demonstrates one way to do this.\nIn [1]: def convert(val):\n   ...:     int_val = int(val, 16)\n   ...:     ref = '0x700000000'\n   ...:     int_ref = int(ref, 16)\n   ...:\n   ...:     return hex(int_ref | int_val)\n   ...:\n\nIn [2]: r_alt = '0xE6'\n\nIn [3]: print(convert(r_alt))\n0x7000000e6\n\n\nA: Do you want to swap Option (Alt) with Command or Control with Command? \nSee Changing modifier keys from the command line\n", "Q: How to reset Spotlight cache/index?

The setup assistant will ask for things like country, computer name, user name, password, wifi settings, etc.\nCan I somehow preconfigure the installation media so that it would complete the entire process without any user interaction?\n\nA: The Apple macOS installer doesn't read settings so people that require a scripted setup add post install scripts or a full fledged MDM to push configuration profiles. You can pick apart the vendor install and roll a combined package - createOSXinstallPkg - but 10.12.4 changes may limit the options there going forward. \nIn the end, your solution for this varies according to your scale and the cost to afford user interaction. \n\n\n*\n\n*5 installs typically you make an image or use ssh / Apple Remote Desktop to script and push out customizations\n\n*50 installs you might use a tool like createOSXinstallPkg or server.app and profile manager\n\n*500 to 5000 installs set up an MDM like munki or jamf pro. \n\n\nOrganizations are successfully deploying \"zero touch\" solutions but that means IT doesn't have to touch the os - end users still need to initiate and handle some subset of the default graphical / interactive steps. Many like iCloud, diagnostic settings, location and Siri can be preconfigured or automated but not everything.  \n\nA: This is hard to do without imaging or management utilities, or both.  Fortunately there is a free one called DeployStudio which can help you set workflows for laying a base image (full image or thin), run scripts, install packages, etc.  You'll still have to do a bunch of research and testing to get things exactly how you want. \nTo get you started... iCloud and diagnostic prompts are stored in com.apple.SetupAssistant.plist.  You'll have to change the keys in both the user template, and in all the user home folders which have this file (which also has to be done after each minor update).  So a launchdaemon would be the easiest way of setting these automatically on every boot.

It shows all my photos from Feb, 2012 - Feb, 2017.  Which is really strange, as I import photos from my phone about once a week.  I.e., I'm imported dozens of times since Feb, 2017.\nHow do I reset/fix this?\n\nA: You could try rebuilding your Photos Library. However, ensure you have a backup of your Photos Library (e.g. a Time Machine backup) before rebuilding the library!\nTo rebuild the library, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that Photos is not running\n\n*While holding down the optioncommand keys, launch the Photos app\n\n*The Repair Library window should appear\n\n*Click on Repair to rebuild your photo library\n\n\nDepending on the size of your library, this may take some time.\n", "Q: How do I play or share a voice memo? \nI can't play this voice memo.

No luck. Although this did work in Windows to create a custom live tile.\nIs there any other way this can be accomplished? \n\nA: Safari doesn't use the HTML of the current page when obtaining the apple-touch-icon. Safari makes a separate HTTP request to the page when you add it as a favourite, and then at regular intervals later on to keep the icon updated.\nYou might find success replacing the icon in the Safari cache, then locking the file so Safari can't overwrite it. You can find the icons at:\n~/Library/Safari/Touch Icons Cache/Images/\n\nOnce you've found the image you wish to change and replaced it, use Get Info to lock the file.\n", "Q: Why is Time Machine not saving Google Chrome History file? I need to restore Google Chrome (Canary) browsing history from a Time Machine backup. It seems Time Machine has backed up all the profile files in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default except the History file. Oops. Why is that, and how can I restore Chrome's History from a backup?\n\nA: Why Chrome history is not backed up\nYou are correct that the ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default location you reference is where Google Chrome's history (among other things) is stored.\nHowever, (and I don't recall exactly where I originally came across this), that App developers can determine which files (if any) they want skipped by a Time Machine backup and that Google doesn't allow Chrome's History to be backed up by Time Machine after changes made in 2009.\nAlthough I only use Google Chrome occasionally, I personally get around this limitation by manually backing up the five files not backed up via Time Machine. The five files in question are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Favicons\n\n*Favicons-journal\n\n*History\n\n*History-journal\n\n*previews_opt_out.db-journal\n\n\nRestoring your missing Chrome history\nNow, in terms of restoring your currently missing history, you may have some luck if you have a Google Account. If so, you could check whether you had Chrome Sync enabled. If you did, Chrome Sync syncs your history (as well as bookmarks, passwords, etc) to your Google Account so you can use them on other devices.\n\nA: There is a different way than trying to back up the History and the History-journal. Because my guess is what you care about is the open tabs that you lost, not the history itself. These are actually backed up by TimeMachine.\nYou can find them here:\n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Sessions\nYou should find 2 'Session_' files and 2 'Tabs_' files there. Close Chrome. Enter TimeMachine from the date of your choosing to the same location. Copy the 4 TimeMachine files. Replace your current 4 files with the ones. Then open Chrome. It will open all your lost tabs.\nI thought I had lost over 200 open tabs in Chrome and got them all back using this method. You might want to back up your current 2 'Session_' files and 2 'Tabs_' as a safety precaution, but you shouldn't need them.\n", "Q: Left AirPods in Washing Machine I stupidly left my AirPods in the washing machine through a whole cycle. I took them out, hand dried them, and they were surprisingly still working. I used them for about an hour after that and then all of a sudden they shut off. \nNow, they won't turn on at all. I've tried holding down the button for 15 seconds and re-charging them with no luck.\nAny ideas for how to fix this problem? Are they permanently dead?\n\nA: Apple support can quote you a repair. Since they have batteries and several processors inside each, immersion and agitation for tens of minutes likely caused an overload / short circuit which will be followed by rapid corrosion of metal in the device. \n\nA: Bag of rice\nPerhaps the bag of dried rice trick as commonly done for iPhones.\nIdeally you would have done something like that before turning them on.

Tried to restart the system and nothing. 3 days ago i updated my Skype and then the icon is gone.\n\n\nA: I can think of three (well, sort of) potential solutions to this. You do not need to try these in any particular order - try one first and if the issue returns, then try the other. Option 1 requires entering commands in Terminal, Option 2 doesn't but sometimes only works temporarily. And the third option is doing both Option 1 and 2.\nOption 1: Reset icon cache\nIf you tried the second solution first and it doesn't work (or it only works temporarily), you can try resetting the icon cache.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal (usually found in the Applications > Utilities folder)\n\n*Enter the following commands, one at a time:\n\n\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \\;\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \\;\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store\nkillall Dock\n\nOption 2: Reset and restart the Dock\nThis remedy is to reset and restart the Dock. However, in doing so, you will need to re-add any non-default icons to your Dock. (I usually find it's a good opportunity for people to start afresh and only add things as they actually use them).\nSo, if your solution doesn't pan out, you can reset and restart the Dock as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder\n\n*Press and hold the option key down\n\n*Now go to the Go menu\n\n*Select the Library option to open the User's Library folder. You can let go of the option key now.\n\n*Go to the Preferences folder (i.e. within the Library folder)\n\n*Find and move the com.apple.dock.plist file to the Trash\n\n*Now open Terminal (usually located in Applications > Utilities)\n\n*Enter this command killall -KILL Dock\n\n*Press enter\nThis should resolve the issue - but remember you'll need to re-add some apps back to the Dock.\nOption 3\nYou may find you need to do both options 1 and 2.\nLet me know how you go.\n", "Q: Could Not Sign In: A server problem is blocking Apple ID sign in.

Because of this, the Forget Network option on the WiFi connection settings isn't really suitable as I'd have to reenter the password to connect each time.\nHow can I remember a specific WiFi connection without having the phone automatically connect to that network when it finds it? I still want to autoconnect to other networks as normal.\n\nA: Forgive me if I'm missing the point of your question, but if you've connected to both SSIDs and your iPhone remembers them (and their passwords), then why wouldn't you just go to Settings > Wi-Fi to manually choose and connect to the network you want when you need to?\nMy point is, according to your question, you'd still like to be able to easily connect to that one when I need to (not that often), and wouldn't this approach achieve that? It's easy to do and since it's not something you need to do often, it's not cumbersome. Your iPhone will remember the password and once you've manually selected a network it'll remain connected to it while the signal is strong enough.\n", "Q: Large dropdown menus (off expected location) I have a problem with dropdown menus appearing in really large size, in a wrong location to where it should be on screen (namely below and to the right of the expected location).

I was having issues with my work laptop so I gave it to our IT guy who sent it to Apple for repairs. When it came back he told me they had to replace the logic board (which made sense based on the problems I was having) and also the SSD (which surprised me because when I was trying to figure out what was wrong it seemed okay).\nThe more I think about it the more I doubt that the drive needed to be replaced. Is there any way to tell if a drive has been replaced?\nMy laptop is a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013). The SSD it currently has is: APPLE SSD SM0512G.\n\nA: If you happened to have written down your hard drives serial number before handing it in for repairs, you could detect replacement by comparing the serial numbers.\nYou probably haven't written down the serial number. Then you could try looking at the drive physically to determine the production year, if written on it. If that is newer than the year your MacBook Pro was bought - it has been replaced.\nYou do not mention which model of MacBook Pro you have, but it must be one of the older models to have a hard drive. It could be possible to check if the disk you have is not one of the models that Apple installed from factory on your specific MacBook Pro model.\nAlso you could consider asking your IT guy how he knows the hard drive was replaced. Perhaps he has paper work to document it. \n", "Q: Transplanting MacBook Air 11\" logic board to a 13\" one I've got an 11\" MacBook Air with a broken screen (big gaping hole due to mishandling). I've also have another 13\" MacBook Air with a broken logic board (won't boot and the beeps seem to say \"memory error\"). What would be the challenges of transplanting the 11\" logic board to the 13\" one?\nI suppose it the 11\" logic board would be somewhat smaller, hence should fit to a 13\" casing with some duct tapes. What else I need to know and how can I adapt those parts?\n\nA: I'm not going to say it'd be absolutely 100% impossible, but unless you had time (and money) to burn on a side project, it really wouldn't be a practical exercise. By this I mean I can't see a way for you to then be able to use it in the usual manner one uses a laptop. \nFor example, your USB and headphone/microphone ports won't line up properly, so how easy will it be to connect devices to them? Sure, you may be able to connect extension leads from the logic board connectors to the exterior of the casing, but this isn't practical on a stationery desk let alone a portable laptop.\nThe other issue is the display module itself. You don't specify the exact models of your MacBook Airs, but the display module needs to be able to connect to the logic board. In order to do so the cabling needs to be in the right location (or long enough) in order to reach the logic board. And, this assumes the connection is the same. Trust me, the cabling inside these devices are no longer than they need to be - everything is a very tight fit!\nSome observations\nHere are some additional comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you did want to do this as a side project, you'd have to be willing to largely accept the device having to either sit stationery on a desk in order to use it, or be willing to do a bit of soldering and custom cabling in order to try and get it to work as a portable laptop.\n\n*Assuming you are willing to do the above, before proceeding you would have to check the cabling (type, location and length) of the 13\" MacBook Air display module and confirm you can connect it to the 11\" logic board. If so, then that's probably the hardest obstacle overcome (as I can't see a way for you to connect the display module otherwise).\n\n*If you have home contents insurance, you may find that your 11\" MacBook Air is actually covered by the insurance policy. It would be easier to determine this and just make an insurance claim. You'll likely find that they deem it uneconomical to repair and will replace it for you.\n\n*If you don't have home contents insurance (or your 11\" model isn't covered by it), since doing what you propose almost certainly restricts it to being a desktop Mac, have you considered just purchasing a used display from a garage sale (or similar) and using it with that? \n\n*As for the 13\" MacBook Air, I sense you may be approaching this in the classical XY problem manner. That is, you have a problem (X) and decide the solution is Y, so you've come here asking a question about Y rather than the actual problem X. To clarify what I mean, your 13\" MBA doesn't boot and beeps at you, so you assume it's a faulty logic board. However, I suggest you ask a separate and specific question about that.\n\n", "Q: How to unlock an iPhone which locked to TalkTalk? I have an iPhone 6S locked to TalkTalk (a UK network) which was bought from Carphone Warehouse - a retailer so it locks to whatever network of the first sim that is inserted (TalkTalk). \nSince TalkTalk sells unlocked mobiles they have no facility of unlocking it.\nNote: TalkTalk is a MVNO and uses Vodafone's network.\nNote: the device is not iOS activation locked. \nHow am I perform a carrier service unlock? And who do I go to?\n\nA: Carrier locking uses the IMEI number to white list and black list devices. Carrier locks are performed at all the cell towers and not in a specific device. Think of this like correcting your home address with several agencies that maintain shared databases of records, you're convincing them to change their records. \nStart with the carrier that you want to pay for service - have them verify that your device is eligible for service. Since you are paying them, they should be able to explain exactly why they won't service your phone. If it was an error by TalkTalk - they have the capacity to request the other carrier fix the registration records on the shared database. \nApple lists carriers that perform unlocks at: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204039\nYou might choose a carrier based on their ability to help you with this problem or error. You might also need a copy of the original purchase if you believe Apple or the original retailer messed up the initial setup of the IMEI for your phone. \n\nA: The only way is to get a Vodafone sim and use it for 30 days and then ask Vodafone to unlock it for you (this is what I did and it has worked for me).\nThe steps are analogous to what you have to if you are on giffgaff but instead, of giffgaff using O2. TalkTalk uses Vodafone (and vodafone unlocks the mobile for free.\nAs mentioned here\n\niPhones bought from giffgaff or direct from Apple do not lock\n  iPhones bought elsewhere (e.g. Carphone Warehouse) lock to the network of the first SIM used - in the case of a giffgaff SIM that's O2.\ngiffgaff cannot unlock it because they didn't lock it.

I've got an older (classic?) black plastic MacBook that can't be upgraded past OS X Lion (10.7.5).

Should I install something like Windows 10 or Linux Mint instead? (If it weren't for security issues I'd be fine keeping it running as-is.)\n\nA: Yes, I would definitely recommend installing an operating system which is currently supported with security updates. Whether that system is a version of Windows, Linux or something else is entirely up to your likings.\nRunning an old, non-supported OS X on a machine connected to the Internet is not a good idea, if you have problems with it being compromised.\n", "Q: Script Editor in iCloud When I open Script Editor (by opening Finder, then clicking on Applications -> Utilities -> Script Editor) the following window shows.\n\nAs can be seen both in the top panel as well as in the side panel, Script Editor is is in the iCloud.

The way the edits work is any time I work on a picture, Photoshop creates a text file with the same name as the picture to which the edits were made.

Thus I now have  a folder with ~1100 RAW images (.NEF), ~1300 text files (.xmp) and a few photoshop files (.psd, .psb).\nI would like to parse this folder, using either AppleScript or a bash command, and either mark or delete the .xmp files that do not have a companion RAW file.

I can mount the network volume and attach the sparsebundle. Running fsck shows no errors. The sparsebundle plist shows VerificationState 0, and doesn't have a RecoveryBackupDeclinedDate.\n\nA: This turned out to be a keychain problem. Possibly I changed the NAS login password and never updated keychain.\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > Time Machine > Stop using \"TimeMachine\" for Backup\n\n*Keychain > search for NAS hostname and delete all matching passwords. I think the problem entries were in the System keychain, but I also deleted entries from the login keychain.\n\n*Settings > Time Machine > Add Backup Disk... > select \"TimeMachine\" > enter password\n\n\nThis situation was confusing because the messages from Time Machine didn't say anything about authentication, and Finder could connect to the NAS volume ok. But apparently backupd uses a different Keychain entry, which was bad or wrong.\n\nA: My problem turned out to be that the Time Machine user account accessing the NAS had exceeded its quota from usage elsewhere in the volume (facepalm).\nThis ended up causing the Info.plist file inside the sparsebundle to be 0 bytes.

I know that there are Apple stores in Istanbul and that Apple gives technical assistance there. However, some says that applecare is not valid in Turkey. They say that in order to benefit from the applecare plan I should either mail my computer to US or bring it to US or perhaps to some nearby EU country where the plan is valid. On the contrary some says that applecare is completely valid for MacBooks in Turkey (though not for Iphones, Ipads, etc.). I would be grateful if I can have the correct answer and, if the plan is valid in Turkey then how the process works. Thank you.\n\nA: Apple products have a global warranty, so you should be covered. \nYou need to contact Apple directly - someone there will be able to organise something for you. You may need to provide proof of purchase, so have that ready (scan it in if you haven't got a digital copy).\nFor your info, below is an experience that may shed some light on this for you.\nI recently helped a lady who purchased a new iPhone from a local online store. About 10 months later the iPhone developed a fault, and while it was definitely under warranty, it took a while to establish this fact because the serial number came up as having been purchased in Thailand, and because it was dated about 7 weeks earlier than when she had purchased it. \nIn this case, she needed to show her purchase receipt to correct the commencement date for her warranty, as it was originally showing as only 8 days remaining compared to the two months she thought she had left. It did get all sorted, but the issue had to get escalated before it was resolved.\nSo, if it was me, I would visit Apple's contact page for Turkey and contact them directly via phone to discuss.\n\nA: While I understand that it has been quite a while since this question has been asked/answered, my wife and I just had this exact situation.  Maybe this will help someone who comes across a search for this question.\nWe have a 2018 MacBook Pro that had 2 issues: 1) a recalled SSD and 2) a failed battery.  We had purchased the MacBook in California last summer with AppleCare and have now moved to Istanbul.\nWe took the MacBook into the Apple Store in the Zorlu Center mall after making a Genius Bar appointment. They looked up the serial number and it was completely repaired in just a few days.\nThey replaced the entire lower 1/2 of the case and it even came back (thankfully) with a US keyboard.  They even had personnel that spoke English, as I'm still struggling with Turkish.\nSuper service!\n", "Q: Is it possible to create a text list of all my apps on the (Mac) App Store?

Sharing an Apple ID may be the answer, but it's not the goal. I know of at least one other possible answer.)\nProblem statement\nHow can I share about 10GB of music on a computer (most of it not purchased from Apple), along with its associated metadata, between two iPhones?\nCurrent situation\nI have a 20GB music collection. I ripped most of it from our CD collection. I got most of the rest from Amazon, Google Play Music, or sites with songs under Creative Commons licenses (free and legal to download). I purchased a couple of dozen songs from iTunes Plus (no DRM); if I need to, I can easily convert them to MP3 files that have nothing to do with Apple.\nCurrently, all 20GB lives on a desktop computer running iTunes. All the music is synced to an iPod Classic.  About 10GB is synced to my spouse's iPhone. The metadata -- playlists, song ratings, playcounts, etc. -- is shared between the computer, the iPod, and the iPhone. All three use the same Apple ID.\nI like the PC/Mac iTunes application. I love being able to simply plug in my iPod or my spouse's iPhone and keep everything in sync.\nI'd love that same simplicity with the new iPhone I'm about to get. I'm not sure what that implies for the choice of Apple ID(s) I'd use with my new iPhone.\nPossible solutions\nThe simplest solution is to sync my new iPhone to the same desktop computer. Would that mean my iPhone would need to use the same Apple ID as my spouse's? How much of a problem would that be?\nAnother simple solution: I could clone my iTunes library (with a new Apple ID) and use it for my new iPhone. The metadata would start the same but fall out of sync; that's unfortunate, but it avoids any problems from sharing an Apple ID between two iPhones. I'd also have to add any new music to both iTunes libraries\nObservations\n\n\n*\n\n*Family Sharing doesn't help because I want to share music not purchased from Apple.\n\n*I don't need to share app purchases.\n\n*Most of our data (e-mail, calendars, contacts, photos) is associated with our respective Google accounts.\n\n*This article describes how to have one Apple ID for \"iTunes & App Store,\" and different Apple IDs for iCloud, Messages, and FaceTime. The article is about sharing an ID to share purchases, which is not what I want.\n\n\n*\n\n*FYI, This \"Think Different\" question goes into even more detail about having different Apple IDs on one iPhone. Edit: so does this article on support.apple.com.\n\n\n*My spouse only uses iCloud for wireless iPhone backups. (I also manually back up her phone to the desktop computer using iTunes.) I expect my iCloud usage to be the same.\n\n*I already have most of my songs (but none of my metadata) uploaded to Google Play Music. Please see \"I'd love that simplicity ...\" above.\nI'm afraid to start setting up my iPhone until I know what Apple ID I want to use. (I think I can begin setting up my new iPhone by choosing \"Move Data from Android,\" then choosing \"Skip This Step\" when I'm asked to sign in with or create an Apple ID. Am I risking anything if start this way?)\n\nA: The iPhones may use separate Apple IDs and share the same music library from itunes, (as you said, all of it is rights free / downloaded from Apple). The Apple ID only comes into play when syncing contacts, calendars, and alternate Apple Services. You shouldn't have any problems with Music syncing between iTunes and your new iPhone. Furthermore, you may download Google Play Music on your phone, and use the already synced content. The choice is yours. \nAll the best!\n\nA: \nThe simplest solution is to sync my new iPhone to the same desktop computer.\n\nThat turned out to work just fine. Two iPhones each with its own Apple ID, one computer.\nWith the iPhone with the Apple ID matching the one in the computer's iTunes: everything Just Works. (I could even manage apps from iTunes. That feature was removed from iTunes. I kinda miss it.) I recently got my spouse an iPad, and everything continues to Just Work.\nWith the iPhone with a different Apple ID: music syncing, backups, and even iOS updates work. That's all I need.\nLife is good.\n", "Q: macOS update closed all my applications? At exactly 4 a.m., macOS gave a popup saying, “Update Available,” then abruptly closed all my applications. I don’t remember receiving any earlier popups or warnings about updates being available.\nIs this normal behaviour? Can I prevent it from happening again somehow?\nHaving this happen at exactly 4 a.m. seems significant. Maybe it assumes I’m not active at that time?\n\nA: You will normally be prompted to install updates as they are detected. However if you were away from your computer you may not see those notifications. Also if you delay them enough times they will eventually be installed for you. Lastly if the updates are detected overnight they may be installed right then as well. This is usually done sometime after 3 a.m.\nYou can go to  → System Preferences → App Store and uncheck the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install app updates\n\n*Install macOS updates\n\n*Install system data files and security updates\n\n\n\nThis will keep macOS from installing updates, quitting apps and/or restarting your system without asking you first.\nYou will still be notified when updates become available, and offered the choice to install them.\n", "Q: How does Script Editor choose the applications to show on the 'tell current application' popup? How does Script Editor choose the applications to show on the 'tell current application' popup? For instance, why doesn't Preview appear on the list (see screencap below)?

If so, how?\n\n\nA: Yes in Script Editor go to menu item Window → Library, then once you see this…\n\nJust click on the + icon and there you can add any other apps you want.\n", "Q: Application created with Script Editor ignores the selected item on the 'tell current application' popup menu Consider the following AppleScript program:\ntell the application \"TextEdit\" to make new document\n\nI saved this script as an Application, and ran it successfully by double-clicking the application icon.\nI then simplified the script by setting the 'tell current application' popup menu to 'TextEdit' and replacing the program with the following line:\nmake new document\n\n\nI saved the script and ran it from within Script Editor. Everything worked OK. I then ran the application by double-clicking the application icon, but now the following error message appeared:\n\nCan't make class document\n  Can't make class document. (-2710)\n\n\nWhat is the reason for this behavior?\n\nA: You cannot create an AppleScript application that only contains the single line of code make new document as it will not execute within the same context it does in Script Editor having made a selection from the \"tell\" application menu.\nAs an AppleScript application you need to explicitly tell the appropriate application to make new document.\nExample: tell application TextEdit to make new document\nIf you only code make new document and save it as, e.g. Code Test.app then make new document executes as tell current application to make new document or more literally in this case, tell application \"Code Test\" to make new document and the Code Test.app lacks the ability to create a new document and therefore errors out.\nWhile in Script Editor, the \"tell\" application menu is a handy shortcut to avoid fully typing out tell application ... and is only for testing code. It is not translated to the literal code that you must be fully type so as to be fully functional within proper context to save as an application (or script for that matter).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro - will 10 hours of continuous fan usage cause damage Is it OK to run a MacBook Pro (late 2013) for 10 hours continuously with fan? \nI am thinking of turning it into a local Android build machine. It has a 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor which means it takes about 8-10 hours to compile my Nexus image (depending on if I have other programs open). The CPU does get hot - close to 90°C. \nI have raised the whole body by keeping it on some plastic feet. \nI am worried if the heat will destroy the logic board or fan will fail soon. \n\nA: You should be fine. 90°C is not that high for a CPU that's under heavy load. I've seen MacBook Pro CPUs run as hot at 117°C when under heavy load.\nAs a point of reference, you can refer to the Intel Mac Temperature Database to get a sense for how hot MacBooks can run. You can search and filter the results as needed.\nAs for your concern that the heat will destroy the logic board or fan will fail soon, these are things that can happen unexpectedly to any computer. However, I wouldn't be worried on the basis of a CPU that runs close to 90°C under load. And, at the end of the day, a computer is a tool and if you need it to be an Android build machine, then that's what you need to use it for. As long as it runs the software and produces the results, then it's capable of doing the work.\nAnd, as always, make sure you have a backup regime in place!\n", "Q: How to stop taskgated on Sierra?

Each folder is titled YYYY-MM FolderName where there are sometimes spaces in FolderName. Within these folders are three folders: Raw, Edited, and Final. My goal is to, with a single bash script, create symbolic links on my Desktop for each Final folder AND rename it to its parent folder. Example: I would like /Volumes/Server\\ RAID/Photos/2016-10\\ Fleet\\ Week/Final to have a symbolic link on the Desktop named 2016-10 Fleet Week.\nI have tried many different varieties of the code I have posted down below, but the code I have included was the most concise code (although it didn't work).\nCode description:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd to Desktop so that symlinks are created there\n\n*use for loop to loop through folders\n\n*create symlink - here is the problem: I need to include the folder name in the file path somehow, but also add \\ before the spaces so that the command doesn't fail.

I stumbled about the problem to loop the results of an mdfind search as quoted or escaped paths.\nCode snippet:\nfor File in $(mdfind -onlyin $MusicSamples 'kMDItemAudioBitRate >= \"44000\"  && _kMDItemUserTags = \"Sample\"')\ndo\n    ln -s $File $DrumFoldr\ndone\n\nThe for loop should create soft links of all matching files in the folder $MusicSamples or its sub folders in the folder $DrumFoldr. The loop works for files with paths/file names without spaces.\n\n\n*\n\n*The answer to a similar question simply suggests to quote $File (... \"$File\" ...). This doesn't work - it simply creates broken soft links with names of the contiguous strings in the original file name: a file named \"1. Artist - Song - Mix.mp3\" will create four or five soft links: \"1.\", \"Artist\", \"Song\", \"Mix.mp3\"  and \"-\".\n\n*Escaping the spaces by piping the mdfind results to a sed command replacing a space with an escaped space \\  will result in something like \"\\ 1.\", \"\\ Artist\" etc.\n\n*Creating an array of the mdfind results with:\nresult=()\nmdfind ... | while IFS= read -r filename; do\n  result+=(\"$filename\")\ndone\n\nand using it in for File in \"${result[@]}\"; do ln -s \"$File\" $DrumFoldr; done doesn't work either.\nHow do I properly escape those spaces in the paths?\n\nA: I just solved a similar problem as I was trying to iterate over mdfind's results of an image search.\ncounter=0\nmdfind image -onlyin $1 | while read line; do \n    ((counter = counter + 1))\n    echo \"$counter: $line\"\ndone\nexit\n\nSo adapting that to your problem, this should work:\nmdfind -onlyin $MusicSamples 'kMDItemAudioBitRate >= \"44000\" && _kMDItemUserTags = \"Sample\"' | while read File\ndo\n    ln -s \"$File\" \"$DrumFoldr\"\ndone\n\n\nA: The best way to handle filepaths with funny characters is to use null delimiters (as fd0 suggested in a comment). mdfind -0 will use this output format, very much like find ... -print0. You can then parse & use the results with xargs -0:\nmdfind -0 -onlyin \"$MusicSamples\" 'kMDItemAudioBitRate >= \"44000\"  && _kMDItemUserTags = \"Sample\"' |\n    xargs -0 -J % ln -s % \"$DrumFoldr\"\n\n(Note that I also double-quoted $MusicSamples and $DrumFoldr, to prevent trouble if either of those contain spaces. Double-quoting variable references is almost always a good idea. Also, this xargs invocation will pass many filepaths with each run of ln -- if this is a problem, you may need to add something like -n1 to make it pass them one-by-one.)\nIf you need to do something more complicated than xargs can handle easily, you can also use a shell while read loop with some special options:\nmdfind -0 -onlyin \"$MusicSamples\" 'kMDItemAudioBitRate >= \"44000\"  && _kMDItemUserTags = \"Sample\"' |\n    while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do\n        ln -s \"$file\" \"$DrumFoldr\"\n    done\n\n(The special options used with read are: -d '' to make it use nulls as delimiters, -r to tell it not to do weird things with backslashes, and IFS= to prevent it from trimming whitespace from the beginning or end of the lines.)\nSee BashFAQ #20: \"How can I find and safely handle file names containing newlines, spaces or both?\" for more info and options.\n\nA: I can tell you I recently found out why the following does not work for me:\n    result=()\n    mdfind ... | while IFS= read -r filename; do\n     result+=(\"$filename\")\n    done\n\nAccording some research on other sites:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/16854280/a-variable-modified-inside-a-while-loop-is-not-remembered\nSo following the CSV example in that answer I can confirm the following works for me:\n    while read -r line; do\n     result+=(\"$line\")\n    done <<< \"$(mdfind \"kMDItemAppStoreCategory == 'Productivity'\")\"\n\n", "Q: Google chrome auto refresh When I try to load a page in Google Chrome without Wi-Fi and then turn on Wi-Fi the page refreshes automatically.\nI do not want this because I don't have time to turn on a VPN before the page loads.\nHow do I prevent this?\nThis is not tab discarding.

Is there an active project supporting these kinds of things?\n\nA: It's not a bug, it's poorly written documentation. The -f option for chown states:\n\nDon't report any failure to change file owner or group, nor modify the exit status to reflect such failures.\n\nThis means the -f option is only applicable if the target file exists and there was an error in changing the owner or group of the file, which of course you can't do on a nonexistent file as in the OP example under macOS.\nTo show that the -f option actually works as intended, use the following compound command in Terminal while not doing so as root or using sudo:\ntouch ${TMPDIR}testfile; chown root ${TMPDIR}testfile; echo $?; rm ${TMPDIR}testfile\n\nThe output will be, e.g.:\nchown: /var/folders/7l/lcvbc47n3sd7jcztdhc9c_pw0000gn/T/testfile: Operation not permitted\n1\n\nIn this first form, without the -f option it fails, exits >0, because the chown command is trying to set the owner of ${TMPDIR}testfile to root while being executed not as root and not using sudo.\nNow execute with the -f option:\ntouch ${TMPDIR}testfile; chown -f root ${TMPDIR}testfile; echo $?; rm ${TMPDIR}testfile\n\nThe output will be:\n0\n\nIn this second form, with the -f option, it succeeds, exits with 0 without having made any change, because it was done not as root and not using sudo, which is necessary to change the owner of a file to root.\n\nNote that each OSes chown is not equal in all functionality to each other. In other words, while I don't have Red Hat, as mentioned in the OP, I do have Linux Mint to compare to, and the man page in Linux Mint -f option for chown states:\n\nsuppress most error messages\n\nAs you see most is the keyword, so it doesn't suppress all error messages in Linux Mint nor is the description of what -f does with chown under Linux Mint as detailed and explicit as under macOS.\nSo while in Linux Mint, not as root or using sudo, chown -f root non_existant_filename will not output an error, however, its exit code is 1, not 0 as it is with the macOS chown example above using -f within its defined context.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (13 inch, early 2015) crashing after use of Dual External Monitor recently I have had a rather odd issue concerning the MacBook Pro 13 inch (early 2015) where it would crash after being unused for periods of 60-80 min when connected with a DisplayPort Cable to an external 4K display.

The initial steps went smoothly until the actual windows installation where I was unable to install Windows on Boot Camp drive. I don't recall exactly if it was a MBR/GPT or NTFS/FAT32 issue, but after formatting the drive I was able to proceed with the installation.\nNow Windows 10 is installed and working as expected, and so is the Boot Camp Utility software inside Windows.\nThe problem is that I have lost the option to boot into macOS. After restarting the machine and holding the Option key, \"Windows\" is the only option I have. Even after setting the default boot option to macOS inside the Bootcamp utility and restarting the machine I am back in Windows.\nI tried the Apple recovery tool by holding the CMD+R at startup and downloading it. After going to the Disk Utility section the the Macintosh HD drive is greyed out:\n\nWhich is solved by unlocking the drive and entering my macOS password.

It will then prompt you to enter your password so it can check to confirm that the encrypted drive is bootable. Then you can select the partition and choose to boot from it.\nNow Reboot as you would normally(without pressing any key while you're doing it) and you should boot automatically inside Mac OS, from there I'd create a new Bootcamp instance.\n\nA: Your disk is not FileVault encrypted. It was decrypted to be resized for Windows' partition and is now attempting to background re-encrypt. FV progress is literally ---- or nothing but Conversion Status:Converting. However the extents ARE successfully encrypted and thus CS sees it as a FileVault partiton. The problem I'm almost certain is from buggy CoreStorage implementation, mainly because CoreStorage is incredibly unfinished... and the fact that BootCamp Installer likely does not know how to treat a FileVault drive that is mid-encryption... on a CoreStorage LVM partition... that it as an MBR/FAT/NTFS based loader needs to resize. I suggest you don't try to layer all these technologies on top of each other in the future. FileVault is especially hard to fix if it get's nuked mid-encryption.\nTry this before attempting to go further to pull the CS partition out of FileVault.\nsudo diskutil unlockVolume 09CCCB6E-6693-4EBB-AA17-D8F91A1DF5C2\n\nuse the password for the FV partition then,\nsudo diskutil cs revert 09CCCB6E-6693-4EBB-AA17-D8F91A1DF5C2 \n\nto disable CS, it may take some time.\nYou should be able to then use standard Disk Utility tools to repair and disable FileVault. You should do this as soon as possible (even if you want to re-enable it later) as your issue is almost certainly down to encryption issues. In the future be very careful with your system in the days after you enable FileVault. It encrypts your drive in the background and sudden power losses can lose you your data.\n\nA: It sounds like you are rebooting without selecting \"reboot into MacOS\" from the system tray in Windows...just a hunch\n", "Q: AppleScript alternatives I've recently discovered AppleScript. AppleScript affords a simple, natural way to programmatically simulate keyboard-and-mouse interaction with Mac applications. AppleScript is great, however it suffers from the following problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The latest stable release is from 2014, and last year the AppleScript product manager was laid off and his position was eliminated.\n\n*The official documentation has not been updated since January 2016, and all of the tutorial and reference books that are dedicated to AppleScript date no later than 2010 (with the exception of this one, which seems to be a copy-and-paste of some stackexchange Q&A with the AppleScript tag). \n\n*Script Editor, the built-in AppleScript development environment, has no debugging capabilities. There seems to be just one commercial IDE for AppleScript*.

Is there an actively developed and supported programming language with a good, cheap IDE, and good, up-to-date documentation, that makes it possible to simulate keyboard-and-mouse interaction with Mac applications in a quick and easy way?

Unlike Script Editor, Smile is free of charge.\n\nA: Since Yosemite, OS X/macOS also supports JavaScript as an inter-process scripting language--officially known as JavaScript for Automation, also referred to as JXA. The documentation (and some would say, the implementation) is somewhat lacking compared to AppleScript, but if you're already more familiar with JavaScript than AppleScript, then it might be an option.\nLike AppleScript, JXA also offers an ObjC bridge allowing you to use Cocoa APIs in your JavaScript.\nOne advantage is that there are many more editors and IDEs out there designed for JavaScript coding than there are for AppleScript, though Script Editor and Automator probably still have the edge for debugging JXA-specific stuff.\nOfficial resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Scripting Essentials (covers AppleScript and JavaScript)\n\n*JXA Release Notes\nSome unofficial resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/dtinth/JXA-Cookbook/wiki \n\n*https://www.macstories.net/tutorials/getting-started-with-javascript-for-automation-on-yosemite/\n\n*https://hackmag.com/coding/getting-to-grips-with-javascript-automation-for-os-x/\n\n*https://tylergaw.com/articles/building-osx-apps-with-js\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript-automation\n\nA: First of all: DON'T PANIC :)\nNo, there are no good/useful/less painful alternatives to Automator/AppleScript. At least not if you really need to automate some workflow within the UI. \n\nA: Script Debugger, which you mention, is free for most uses, with a $99.99 USD fee, (1-2 users), only for certain advanced features.\nI wouldn't be too worried by the lack of development: the language is very stable, and apps (including those by Apple) continue to have support for AppleScript.\nFor instance, Preview's AppleScript capabilities have improved since 2014.\n", "Q: lost phone and password Apple ID I have used iPhone 6s before it was stolen in December 2016. I bought an iPhone 7 Plus but cannot login into my old account. I already tried to sign in but it failed. It seems that the password has changed. I tried all my password possibilities but it still will not work. \nI need to login to my Apple ID because all my applications are linked with the old iPhone.\nI had also tried to enter my credit card number but still not work.\n\nA: If you are sure that you have the correct email address for the Apple ID, you could try to reset the password using the following link: appleid.apple.com\nThe website will ask for your birthday and possibly also your security questions.\nIf you don't know the answer to your security questions anymore, you can contact Apple Care.

I've installed less via\nhomebrew install less\n\nbut less starts the system version of less, not the one installed via homebrew. which less shows:\n$ which -a less\n/usr/local/bin/less\n/usr/bin/less\n\nwhere /usr/local/bin/less is a symlink to ../Cellar/less/487/bin/less (homebrew less)\nand /usr/bin/less  is the system less. echo $LESS returns nothing. How can I start homebrew less instead of system less by default?\n\nA: If homebrew is correctly installed /usr/local/bin/ is checked before /usr/bin/. Check this with echo $PATH, this will show you the path's the OS is trying to find the command you entered and it is trying them in the order that is shown.\nA little fancier\nusing the bash shell:\necho $PATH | awk '{ n = split($0, paths, \":\"); for (i=0; ++i <= n;) print i, paths[i] }'\n\n(using the fish shell):\necho $PATH | awk '{ n = split($0, paths, \" \"); for (i=0; ++i <= n;) print i, paths[i] }'\n\nThis will show an numbered list of the path's tried. Mine shows\n1 /Users/peter/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin\n2 /usr/local/sbin\n3 /usr/local/bin\n4 /usr/bin\n5 /bin\n6 /usr/sbin\n7 /sbin\n8 /Library/TeX/texbin\n\nThe system will traverse the directories in the above order looking for commands, in your case less. If it's not in the first one, it will try the next one until it runs out of options and throw up an error.\nSo if your echo $PATH shows similar results as mine you are using the homebrew version of less.\n\nA: This might be due to bash's hash table of commands in PATH still using the old value. Remove the hash of less, or clear the hash, so that bash re-searches PATH:\nhash -d less\n# or, hash -r\n\nYou can also manually add a path to the table:\nhash -p /usr/local/bin/less less\n\nFrom the Bash manual (emphasis mine):\n\nIf the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no\n  slashes, Bash searches each element of $PATH for a directory\n  containing an executable file by that name. Bash uses a hash table to\n  remember the full pathnames of executable files to avoid multiple PATH\n  searches (see the description of hash in Bourne Shell Builtins). A\n  full search of the directories in $PATH is performed only if the\n  command is not found in the hash table.\n\n\nA: I restarted the shell, and this fixed the problem. Maybe a caching issue.\nIf this doesn't help, make sure that /opt/homebrew/bin appeares above /usr/bin when running\necho $PATH | tr ':' '\\n' | nl`\n\n", "Q: Activation lock MacBook to Apple ID? Is it possible to lock my MacBook to my Apple ID so that if it gets stolen (macOS) is useless when someone tries to reinstall it?\n\nA: New Mac hardware supports activation lock:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208987\nTo use it, you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS Catalina\n\n*a mac with a T2 chip\n\n*activate two-factor authentication for your Apple ID\n\n*Make sure Secure Boot is enabled for your mac (it is enabled by default)\n\n\nHow to Activate it:\n- turn on Find My Mac\nHow to check that Activation Lock is on:\n- Choose Apple menu  > About this Mac.\n- Click System Report.\n- Click Activation Lock Status under Hardware. \nTurn off Activation Lock:\nBefore you send your Mac in for service, sell it, or give it away, you should turn off Activation Lock. \nIf you have access to the device, turn off Find My Mac to disable Activation Lock, and then sign out of iCloud:\n- Choose Apple menu  > System Preferences.\n- Click Apple ID, then click iCloud.\n- Turn off Find My Mac.\n- Click the Sign Out button. \nIf you can't access your Mac and you need to turn off Activation Lock, follow these steps:\n- Go to iCloud.com and sign in with your Apple ID. \n- Click Find iPhone.\n- Select All Devices, then click your Mac.\n- Click Erase Mac. Select Next until the device is erased.\n- Click the X next to your Mac. \n\nA: There's no activation lock on macOS, however you can enable Lost Mode using Find My Mac. This will lock the Mac with a PIN, which will be required to use the Mac again, and cannot be bypassed by reinstalling macOS.\n\n\nLock your Mac\n  You can use Find My Mac to remotely lock your Mac with a passcode. You can also display a custom message on its screen.\n\nIf your Mac is lost or stolen\n\nA: On computers without the T2 (or even with it), you can enable a Firmware password.\n\nFor even more protection, you can set a firmware password. A firmware password prevents users who don't have the password from starting up from any disk other than the designated startup disk.\n\nTechnically this can be bypassed. As apple states on that page\n\nIf you can't remember your firmware password or passcode, schedule an in-person service appointment with an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider. Bring your Mac to the appointment, and bring your original receipt or invoice as proof of purchase.\n\nThis indicates that it is likely possible to bypass it (as opposed to encryption). My guess is that the firmware needs to be replaced which is not a particularly easy process and likely requires mangling with hardware which is why Apple must do it. \nIt's not perfect but its the next best thing if you don't have a T2 Chip.\n", "Q: Shutdown script doesn't work as a cronjob So I have this script to shutdown Macs after 24 hours runtime.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmy_macs=( Mac1 Mac2 Mac3 )\n\nMAX_UPDAYS=1\n\nCURR_TIME=$(date +%s)\nMAX_UPTIME=$(( MAX_UPDAYS * 86400 ))\nADMINUSER=\"pcpatch\"\n\n\necho \"Remote Shutdown Check vom $(date)\"  | tee -a /Users/admin/Shutdown/Log/Shutdown 2>&1\nfor MAC in \"${my_macs[@]}\"\ndo\n    echo -n \"Überprüfe ${MAC}... \"\n\n    if /sbin/ping -q -c3 \"${MAC}\" >/dev/null; then \n        echo \"${MAC} ist angeschaltet.

The shift key is almost always stuck after I wake the computer and login. However this does not affect text for some reason, I can still use the shift key normally in all text fields. It does however affect the slow animation and multiple selection stuff that happens while pressing shift, which makes using the mac almost impossible.\nThis is always fixed after I reboot, but 9/10 times the key is stuck again after I wake it up and login. Additionally, the problem only happens if the laptop was sleeping long enough for the login screen to appear. The key works fine on the hardware side so I'm pretty sure its a Software thing. \nI also couldn't find anyone else with this problem.\n\nA: I have a workaround which works and involves going to the login screen. Sometimes that is enough to fix. If that doesn't work, switch to the guest user and then log out.

One of the things I've seen with macOS when it comes to the Dock is that it can sort of glitch when you've been adding lots of items. This seems to happen moreso with folders (especially if you've added one, removed it, and then tried to add it back again).\nWhat always resolves this glitch when I see it, is a simple reboot of the Mac. After rebooting, it accepts the folder. So I'd try restarting your Mac and seeing if that's what the problem is in this case.\n", "Q: Find images of a specific size and move them to trash from terminal Im sorting images in a kinda large image library, and thumbnails from old iPhoto-library is still in there. And I'm in need of removing them to improve speed of sorting the images.\nI have found this answer here for linux, but how about macOS? Is there a way of searching a folder, recursively, and determine if the image *.jpg, *.png, *.bmp, *.jpeg have the W360 and H270?\nRunning Sierra 10.12.4\n\nA: Here is an example bash script that can achieve the goal natively, no need to install anything.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntargetDir=\"$HOME/Pictures\"\n\nfind \"$targetDir\" -iname '*.jpg' -o -iname '*.png' -o -iname '*.bmp' -o -iname '*.jpeg' 2>/dev/null | \\\nwhile read -r filename; do\n    hw=\"$(sips -g pixelHeight -g pixelWidth \"$filename\" 2>/dev/null)\"\n    h=\"$(awk '/pixelHeight/{print $2}'<<<\"$hw\")\"\n    w=\"$(awk '/pixelWidth/{print $2}'<<<\"$hw\")\"\n    if [[ $h -eq 270 ]] && [[ $w -eq 360 ]]; then\n        echo rm \"$filename\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nAll you need to do is set the targetDir variable to the starting point of where you want the find command to look. The default is the Pictures folder within your Home folder.\nNote: In the example script the echo command needs to be removed from in front of rm \"$filename\" in order for the files to actually be deleted and is there so you can first test the output of the script as to what files will be deleted. You can of course choose to remove it without testing and just go for it, if you're confident that you want to delete any .jpg, .png, .bmp or .jpeg file with dimensions of 270 pixel height by 360 pixel width within the targetDir.\nAlso note that depending on the total file count of the target file extensions, the running of this script can take some amount of time to complete. On my system it found ~1000 files to delete out of 27500 files in my Pictures folder and took at least 5 to 10 minutes to complete.\nThat said, I ran this script, as it's written, and the only files other then the test file I created with the target dimensions, all other files found where in one specific location within my iPhoto Library bundle in the Thumbnails folder. So, wouldn't it just be easier to go into the bundle and delete the contents in Finder? That is, if it's really just those Thumbnails you want to get rid of!\n\nIf you don't know how to use the script, do the following in Terminal:\ntouch delete270x360images\nopen delete270x360images\n\nCopy and paste the script code from above into the opened delete270x360images document, modify as needed/wanted and then save and close.\nIn Terminal, make it executable:\nchmod u+x delete270x360images\n\nNow to use it in Terminal, type the following and then press enter.\n./delete270x360images\n\nWait for it to complete.\n", "Q: iPhone on my account, but activation locked to another account I've had a secondhand iPhone for three years, using it with my iCloud account.

To my surprise, upon reset, it went into activation lock mode and asked for the previous owner's login.\nThe phone is listed in my iCloud Settings. Should I try to track down the previous owner, or will removing it from my own iCloud Settings page free it? (But removing it will also wipe the last evidence that the phone is mine.)\nAnother way of looking at the question: Can a single phone be listed in several iCloud accounts?\n\nA: It seems that the official Apple line on this is that they only provide support if you have the device's original receipt, end of story. They don't want to admit fault for this issue. Worst part is, they should be able to tell when their database has two duplicate Find My iPhone records for the same device.\n", "Q: AppleScript version I've tried to figure out my AppleScript version, and arrived at a contradiction.\nAccording to Wikipedia, the latest AppleScript version is 2.7. According to this Ask Different answer, if I run the latest version of OS X, then I have the latest AppleScript version. I run macOS Sierra version 10.12.4. According to Wikipedia, the latest version of OS X is macOS 10.12 Sierra. Therefore I run the latest version of macOS. Therefore I run the latest AppleScript version. Therefore my AppleScript version is 2.7.\nHowever, according to this Ask Different answer, my current AppleScript version is specified in the 'About Script Editor' dialog of the Script Editor application, and the 'About Script Editor' dialog of my Script Editor application says\n\nAppleScript 2.5\n\nWe have arrived at a contradiction!\nHow can this be explained?

I get the notification on my Mac but my Apple Watch will not ping me. From what I can tell everything is setup correctly to receive notifications on my phone and my watch but when the Mac is on, it steals notifications. How do I disable this so that my watch still buzzes me even when my Mac is on?\n\nA: This might blow a lot of people's minds. After spending hours trying to figure this out with no answers online, here's the answer I figured out.\nThe problem is that Calendar notifications are by default configured to be \"Alerts\" rather than banners. When you have a notification set to an \"Alert\" the device you currently have open (in the order of Mac > Watch > Phone) will steal the Alert from your other devices and you will never be notified because it showed up on your Mac. Thus, the trick is to set the Calendar notifications to be Banners rather than Alerts. In fact, you should set all of your notifications for all apps to be Banners because the Alert style breaks the whole purpose of your Apple Watch. The whole point of the Apple Watch is that it's on your body and lets you know when you need to notified. But if you have any notifications set to Alert rather than Banner style, your notifications will be stolen away from your Watch by your Mac.\nI'm puzzled by the lack of documentation and information on this subject from Apple. \n", "Q: How can I set my mouse to click whenever it stops moving? I have arm pain, and one helpful feature I've used in the past is where the mouse will automatically click whenever it stops moving and lingers on a spot for one second.\nI swear I've used this before on a Mac, but I can't figure out how to enable it. Are there any settings or Mac apps that enabled us?\n\nA: This is not a direct solution to your question but, I hope some of these suggestions will make your life a little bit easier.\nMac accessibility features are awesome.  Once you identify what your needs are and what the computer can actually do for you, You can virtually set up custom dictation commands, and use other accessibility features to control your entire computer. \nThe first thing I would suggest is enabling enhanced dictation commands in your accessibility preferences.  You can create custom voice commands to make your life much easier.  For example, I have set up custom commands to open up any webpage I frequent by simply saying “open Facebook“ or “open youtube“ etc..  Once I realized how easy it was to automate tasks on the computer,  I started reading about AppleScript and learning how to create scripts and applications that I could control with my voice and create custom commands for those also. For example, I created Applescripts that would insert my username and passwords into what ever fields I needed to insert them in.  Now for those scripts, which I made speakable, all I have to say is “insert username” or “insert password”  and my computer does everything for me.\nAlso using the dictation commands, there is a command that you could say “show numbers” in any open application (see image…)\n\nThen all I have to do is say \"14\" If I wanted to click on the highlighted \"Dictation\".  Making life even easier, you can even just select or highlight something, while enhanced dictation is active, and say \"make this speakable\" and your computer will launch the dictation commands set up dialogue for you:\n\nYou may also want to look into these items in the Accessibility preferences:\n\n\nHere is an auto clicking solution you may be interested in.\nActivate “Enable Mouse Keys” in System Preferences/Accessibility/Mouse & Trackpad.\n\nYou can paste this following script in a new Script Editor document then export it as an application (naming it something like “Auto Click”).  \ntell application \"System Events\"\n    delay 1  -- this line is optional\n    key code 87\nend tell\n\nYou can then locate and select that new Auto Click.app in Finder, and once that file is highlighted, you can simply speak the command “Make This Speakable” (assuming you have advanced dictation commands enabled in your system preferences).  You can then configure this new Dictation Command to run the Auto Click.app (which will click immediately wherever your mouse cursor is located) whenever you speak your new command.\nBe sure to add Auto Click.app to the list of applications allowed to control your computer.\n\n\nA: macOS Sierra has built-in Dwell Control, which you can enable in the Accessibility system preferences. It's primarily designed for people using eye- or head-tracking devices, but you can certainly use it with just the mouse/trackpad, so it's probably worth trying that first.\nFor full instructions, see Apple's support article.\n\nA: I found a third-party app that seems to provide this called DwellClick - is that possibly what you were thinking of?\n", "Q: Getting bizarre error message from Mail I have Mail set up to handle two different accounts: [my name]_iCloud, and [my name]_Gmail. \nToday, when I try to send a message from the iCloud account, I get this message:\nCan't Connect to the account \"[my name]_iCloud\".\nEnter the password for user \"\".\nThe message is exactly as I typed -- it does not provide the user name (which would've been [my name]@icloud.com).

I didn't notice the prompt and closed the laptop. When I opened my Mac again, the Mac was at the same state, waiting for me to respond to the prompt.  Finally, I responded to that prompt and the Mac continued to shutdown. \nIssue: After restarting the laptop, there was huge slowness in \"Trackpad pointer speed\" and \"mouse pointer speed\". So, I tried to set the tracking speed to fast, but the moment I close the window, it resets to slow. See below. \nI tried to delete com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist and com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse, so Mac would create a new one, if it had write permissions. The Mac created new files but the issue still persists.\nSame case with the case of mouse speed too. \nAny help is highly appreciated.\n\n\nA: Although according to his comment it didn't help Mattias, the first thing I would try is resetting the NVRAM.\nSince you don't specify what model your Mac is, I've included two different sets of instructions. Choose the one that applies.\nResetting the PRAM/NVRAM on ALL MODELS EXCEPT for Late-2016 MacBook Pro models\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models\nTo reset the NVRAM on all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote 1: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nNote 2: These steps will also work to reset the NVRAM (or PRAM) for all Macs. However, the late-2016 MBP models actually required the commandoptionpr keys to be held down for 20 seconds, while earlier Macs did not require this, but doing so does not cause any problems either.\n\nA: I called up apple on this. Three things we tried.\n1. Login in safe mode, change and save the track speed setting - works.\n2. Create another user, change and save the track speed setting - works.\nBut when I login with my regular account, it does not save the preferred track speed, and resets to slow.\n3. The last option we tried and worked was to re-install the OS, using Command + R at startup. This option took 30 minutes or so. But, kept all my data/preferences intact.\nHTH.\nI haven't tried the solution by @Monomeeth.\n\nA: For whatever reason, I think the issue is with this option. If you select the option, it is causing the track speed reset to slow. I did couple of shutdown/restarts without that option selected and it seem to have fixed the issue. \nThis may or may not be the root cause. \n\n\nA: I had this problem but I had smoothmouse installed.  Once I disabled it for mice it worked just fine.\n", "Q: Need to automate an SMB path into a UNC path before sending to Win10 clients New here, but I'm having difficulty putting together an AppleScript that will basically take an SMB link and turn it into a UNC link before I send it over to a couple of Win10 clients. \nAll same network, we're all using a SNS NAS and it's for Adobe Premiere links. We can do this all manually, but the editors don't have time/patience to convert each link. We're looking for an automated script that we could integrate as a service that will convert selected text.\nI found the article below, but it's the reverse to what we're looking for. I tried reversing all of the functions in it but wasn't able to get it to run properly.\nhttps://gist.github.com/anonymous/2211017\nIt'd also be awesome if the 'service' that is created simple copies the entry into the clipboard so that the end-user can paste it into a couple of different things like email and Slack messenger.\nHopefully someone can help or steer me in the right direction.

If you need to account for anything else, i.e. read the comments to this answer, you'll need to modify the code according to your needs. That said, in all of my years as a Network Systems Administrator and Network Systems Engineer I never created shares containing spaces or other then the need for colons, slashes, backslashes and alphanumeric characters and therefore this simple example is all that I'd need to translate any, e.g. smb://server/folder to \\\\server\\folder, SMB Path I ever used to a UNC Path. YMMV!\n\nIn Automator, create a new Service workflow, then add a Run AppleScript action to it while replacing the default AppleScript code with the code below:\non searchReplace(theText, SearchString, ReplaceString)\n    set OldDelims to AppleScript's text item delimiters\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to SearchString\n    set newText to text items of theText\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ReplaceString\n    set newText to newText as text\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to OldDelims\n    return newText\nend searchReplace\n\non run {input, parameters}\n    set selectedText to item 1 of input as string\n    set convertedText to searchReplace(selectedText, \"smb://\", \"\\\\\\\\\")\n    set convertedText to searchReplace(convertedText, \"/\", \"\\\\\")\n    set the clipboard to convertedText as string\n    return convertedText\nend run\n\nThen save the Service as: Convert SMB Path to UNC Path\nNow Convert SMB Path to UNC Path will appear on the Services menu or Services context menu when text is selected and when the Service is used, the UNC Path is placed on the Clipboard. (This of course assumes the selected text was actually an SMB Path, otherwise what's placed there is just whatever text was selected when the Service was run which will include any substitutions made.)\nExample SMB Path smb://server/folder will be converted to UNC Path \\\\server\\folder and placed on the Clipboard.\nNote: Note the settings of the Service in the image below. The Output replaces selected text checkbox is unchecked. You may check it, if that's what you want, however, if the selected text is not actually replaceable then the Service will not appear on the Services menu or Services context menu.\n\n", "Q: osascript and AppleEvents I logged the AppleEvents that get sent from a Terminal window. The event that the osascript command sends to the AppleScript compiler/interpreter wasn't logged. How come?\nIn greater detail, the following argument consists of three hypotheses followed by their logical conclusion. However, experiment shows that the conclusion is false. Hence the argument is faulty. Unfortunately, I don't know why it is faulty. Where does it break?\nHypotheses\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS comes with a built-in AppleScript compiler/interpreter that is installed as an OSA component.\n\n*The Terminal command osascript does not \"know\" AppleScript. When passed a line of AppleScript code, it passes it on to the AppleScript compiler/interpreter via the OSA architecture by sending out an AppleEvent.\n\n*The following line of code, when run in the Terminal, will cause all AppleEvents sent by commands that are executed from the same Terminal window afterwards to be printed out in the Terminal:\nexport AEDebugSends=1\n\nConclusion\nAfter running the following two commands in a Terminal window:\nexport AEDebugSends=1\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to activate'\n\ntwo AppleEvents should be printed out:\n\n\n*\n\n*One directed from osascript to the AppleScript compiler/interpreter to compile and run the command 'tell application \"Finder\" to activate'.\n\n*One directed from the AppleScript compiler/interpreter to Finder to activate itself.\n\n\nActual output\nOnly one AppleEvent gets printed out, the one sent to Finder:\n\nAE2000 (4085 ): Sending an event:\n  ------oo start of event oo------\n  aevt('misc'\\'actv' transactionID=0 sourcePSN=[0x0,e00e \"Finder\"] timeout=7200 eventSource=3 { &'subj':null(), &'csig':magn(65536) })\n  ------oo  end of event  oo------\n\n\nA: tl;dr : Language components are just dependencies used by the executable and can be accessed through the shell without Apple events.\nA: Your argument breaks at a couple of points made in number 2.\na. \"The Terminal command osascript does not \"know\" AppleScript.\"\nAgreed, it does not have all of the languages it supports self contained in one executable.  However, that's where dependencies come in, and when you think of it that way; it's not too troubling that it can access dependencies through your shell like any other application can. \nb. \"it passes it on to the AppleScript compiler/interpreter via the OSA architecture by sending out an AppleEvent.\"\n\n\"When a scripting component executes a script, statements in the script may result in Apple events being sent to applications (developer.apple.com)\".\n\nThe executable is not limited to only using either code within itself or an Apple event call. Similar to almost every process or application on your machine, it relies on various core libraries and specifically it uses the osa language components installed on your system. It does not use Apple events for passing your script to the language component. \n\nsee supported languages:\n\n❯ osalang \n\n\nthese language components live here:\n\n❯ ls /System/Library/Components/\n\nSince osascript can access your system's language components directly through the shell, you'll never seen an Apple event triggered just to process/interpret the script input.\n\nfor example compare these two commands where the first uses the AppleScript language but does not interact with any other applications:\n\n❯ osascript -e 'set myVar to \"hello\" & \"world\"'\nhelloworld\n\n\nand the second where we tell terminal to do something:\n\n❯ osascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\" to do script (\"echo helloworld;\")'\nAE2000 (63917 ): Sending an event:\n------oo start of event oo------\naevt('core'\\'dosc' transactionID=0 sourcePSN=[0x0,dd7dd7 \"Terminal\"] timeout=7200 eventSource=3 { '----':utxt('utxt'(TEXT(\"echo helloworld;\"))), &'subj':null(), &'csig':magn(65536) })\n------oo  end of event  oo------\ntab 1 of window id 32644\n\nOnly the one that interacted with an application, not just the AppleScript language itself, triggered an Apple event.\nRead over this article again and you will see how this explination fits now.  OSA Architecture implemented via Apple events is the powerful construct allowing for automating between applications; but interpretation of the input script itself is just done by your system's compatible language component behind the scenes.\n", "Q: Can automator create symlinks but skip existing files? Today I discovered the awesome Create Symlinks action from JuneCloud.  It works great, but creates duplicate files (appending a number to each one) for any symlink that already exists in the final location.  I want it to just ignore those files and keep on trucking.\nI tried using a shell script ln -s but that just plain fails with a The action “Run Shell Script” encountered an error. message after hitting a file that already exists.\nIs there a way to create a symlink but SKIP existing files?  I know I can us -f to overwrite but I'd rather just skip.  How can this be done either in Automator or shell script?\n\nA: Yes! You can do it easily in the shell script. The -h flag fits the bill, as described (sort of) on the ln man page. So instead of doing ln -s, do ln -sh.\nHere's an example. Say you wanted to make a symbolic link of each of your downloads, which would exist on your Desktop, but you already have some symbolic links there. Then you could do this:\ncd Downloads\nfor f in *; do ln -sh ~/Downloads/\"$f\" ~/Desktop; done;\n\nFor any files that you have that you already have symbolic links for, the command will print out:\n    ln: /Users/******/Desktop/FlashPlayer.dmg: File exists\n\nThe command does this printing after running so it does not throw any errors nor require any additional inputs.\n", "Q: Highlight scientific paper with preview Scientific articles are usually formatted with two columns.

I don't like the series Mail/iCal from Apple, reason why I bought Outlook 2016 for Mac. I was able to transfer the contacts but I am facing difficulties transferring the email database. It seems that outlook doesn't support the email format of the apple mail. \nIs there a way to transfer all the emails with their categories from Apple Mail to Outlook 2016 for Mac ?\n\nA: Apple Mail archives its database in .mbox format and outlook for mac can only import either .pst or .olm format files. It definitely cannot import emails exported from apple mail. If you have an Imap enabled account then you can directly sign in to the outlook mac, it might take a while depending on your email database size, your files will start uploading.\nYou can take alternatives as well, where some application are available that can convert the file format.

I was just given an old iMac without a Hard Drive.\nThis is the model (image from the software Mactracker):\n\nIt only gives the following details about the hard drive:\n320, 500, 750 GB, or 1 TB 7200-rpm\nHowever, when I consulted ifixit to see how I could replace the hard drive, and clicked on the suggested replacement hard drive, some instructions said:\n\nImportant: To ensure compatibility with the 2009 and 2010 21.5\" or 27\"\n  iMac, the replacement hard drive must be of the same brand as the\n  original. The model number of the hard drive does not matter as long\n  as the brand matches. 2011 and up iMacs cannot be supported by us.\n\nWhich doesn't help since I have the 2008 model. I am also not sure whether a 2.5 or 3.5 hard drive is required. The \"About this Mac\" menus are not available since the computer doesn't power on. I don't know what the RAM is (2.8 or 3.06).\nWhat is the exact reference for a compatible model for this iMac Early 2008?\n\nA: I'm going to try to answer your question as best I can.\n\n\n*\n\n*The drive is definitely a 3.5\" SATA disk.\n\n*The notice doesn't apply to your model.\n\n*I'm not sure why the notice suggests to choose the same brand. For one, the drives are likely co-branded, with markings for both Apple and the company that made the drive. The companies that would have supplied the drives would be, AFAIK: Western Digital, Seagate and (possibly) Hitachi.\n\n*I'm not sure how similar you have to go in terms of storage. I'd guess you could probably use any SATA drive, but because of the temperature sensor, if I were you, I'd use one of the ones suggested in the guide, depending on your storage requirements (1-4TB).\n\n\nTL;DR: If you're super worried about compatibility and need to get the machine working fast, disassemble it and look at the HDD to determine the brand, then order that brand. Otherwise, I would suggest you buy whichever of the listed HDDs strikes your fancy - I doubt that it really matters.\n\nA: The only tricky bit I've seen is where some SATA2 controllers in that era had an issue with most brands of SATA3 SSDs. Not sure about the iMac but I encountered it on a 2009 MBP.\nBased on the Macsales/OWC page, your iMac will have a 3.5\" space so if you use a 2.5\" drive, you'll need a caddy.\nDoing this on an iMac isn't for the faint of heart so watch the OWC install video for an SSD (it will be the same process for a spinner) and make sure you have the exact tools required. Those tiny screws are easy to strip if you try to use something \"close enough\". If you can at all swing it, I'd install a 480GB OWC SSD instead of a spinning drive as it's going to run much, much better. Even if you go for a spinner, I'd talk to OWC first and spend the extra few bucks to get one from them. If you encounter an issue, their tech support is good.\nhttps://eshop.macsales.com/shop/ssd/owc/imac/2008\nInstalling an old 3.5\" drive would be way down my list.

It's not something I've done a whole lot until recently so I was trying to find a solution to the problem that when I'm working in an application on the connected monitor, how can I always have the dialog boxes for that application open on that monitor, and vice versa? It's pretty annoying and definitely slows down work a bit, especially if an application open on the other monitor is in full screen.\n\nA: If you open System Preferences - Display, then click on Arrangement, you will see a white bar above one of the displays. This is where the menu bar is and will be the primary display and probably the screen that the dialogue boxes are opening on. To change just drag it across to the other screen in the Arrange window and this should then make the dialogue box appear on that screen.\n", "Q: Boot Camp can't see new internal SSD I have a 15-\" MacBook Pro Retina from mid-2014 which came with a 250-GB SSD (which I will henceforth refer to as \"the old SSD\").

Sometimes, I can use it with no problems, but sometimes it slows down the entire computer and freezes processes.\nFor example, spotlight might stop working, and if I kill it through the Terminal, no new spotlight process launches. And for example the dock might freeze, not responding to anything and just showing a beach ball when I put my mouse on it. Same thing with Finder.\nSome things still work but the more I use the computer with the hard drive in, the more processes freeze, for example if I quit Safari I can't open it again. However, if I just unplug the cable suddenly every single process starts responding/working again instantly, with no problems.\nI have tried to repair my hard drive through Disk Utility, but it finds no problems.\n\nA: This is a common issue with mechanical HDDs (non-SSD).\nmacOS sends a command to the external device (your HDD) but the device responds slowly.

I download DaisyDisk to discover why so much of my space was gone after only 4 months. This showed me that com.apple.bird was taking up 89GB!\nSo I researched this also and an answer to this question (What is com.apple.bird? Why does it grow so big?) suggested using a script to tell me what apps are using this 89GB. I actually got the script to work (pat on back for me!) and this tells me that WhatsApp is the problem.\nNow I'm freaking out because my friends and I all use WhatsApp to talk about school, parties, life and I don’t know what to do. I use WhatsApp on my iPhone 5c mainly, but the answers to the question about com.apple.bird are really scary to me because it's not clear if i will lose everything if I delete what's in com.apple.bird? But, if I don’t delete it, I'll run out of space soon!\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: Although not addressing your bird issue directly, whenever these things happens to me I have to assume it is going to happen again in the future. That's why after WhatsApp and iMessages grew too large on my phone I decided to migrate my conversations to the Telegram service, which is basically the same thing but cloud based. That means people can send me 100's of MB of video and the size of the app remains the same — WhatsApp OTOH just grows with every video I receive. \nGranted, your problem might just have been a caching bug and you're otherwise fine with the app size, but I hopefully never have to do housecleaning again and couldn't be happier with the switch. \nCurrently on my phone:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMessage 512 MB\n\n*WhatsApp 189 MB\n\n*Facebook Messenger (clean install -- never used) 165 MB\n\n*Telegram 37 MB\n\n\nNot affiliated with Telegram in any way\n\nA: If you don’t already, I want to suggest in the strongest terms possible that you have a Time Machine backup of your data. A portable 1TB hard drive is not expensive and you can plug it in and Time Machine will prompt you if you want to use it for backups. I would do that before proceeding with any answers provided (mine included).\nAs for that huge 89GB of data, this is actually safe to remove. However, please don’t do this manually. Instead, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone ensure you have iCloud activated\n\n*Make sure your MacBook is connected to the internet\n\n*On your MacBook, go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on iCloud \n\n*At the top where you have the iCloud Drive checkbox ticked, untick it\n\n*A somewhat scary message will appear - click on the Delete from Mac button. Don’t worry, your documents will still be on iCloud (and that’s another reason why we made sure iCloud was activated on your iPhone at Step 1)\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n*Within about 5 minutes most of that 89GB in com.apple.bird will be freed up\n\n*Once you’re satisfied that you’ve freed up all that space, repeat Steps 3 & 4\n\n*At the top you can now tick the iCloud Drive checkbox again\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\nLet me know if my steps aren’t clear or if you have any problems.\nRemember: - Make sure you regularly backup your MacBook.\n", "Q: AppleScript execution stops when a error popup show up I am trying to execute an apple script to attach a file to outlook.

The files are image files (PNG, JPG, TIFF, PSD, etc.) and only the smallest size is affected.\nIn column view at text size 12 only the generic jpg, or png icon shows, but not the image content itself.  If I change the text size (in view options) to 13, the icons slightly increase in size and laod and display correctly.\nIn icon view the same happens with the icons set to 16x16.

I have my work iCloud account that needs to be primary for Keynote collaboration etc. \nBut all most Notes are in my personal iCloud account. I can use my personal iCloud account for iMessages and iTunes, is there a way to also use my personal iCloud account for notes? \nDid a bit of searching and found this answer - Notes from iCloud account don't sync with devices when added as secondary account - that is a bit confusing with the various upgrades downgrades of OS. I am on all the latest OS versions. \n\nA: As of now, it is not possible. I tried adding a secondary iCloud account in Notes>Accounts and Apple restricts the sync of Notes, etc and only supports Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and Reminders on secondary iCloud accounts:\n\n\nA: I'd try (no guarantee) to connect the secondary iCloud via the \"Others\" button in the mail settings, where you'd have to put in the imap/smtp-server-adress from iCloud. \nYou can find these here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202304\nAfter that you can enable the Notes and deactivate Mail. The best way to find out is over trial and error although it takes up time...\n\nA: While you may not be able to sync multiple iCloud notes with other iCloud accounts, you can still share those notes directly from the web (or other devices) so that they appear directly on your personal devices. This will allow you to read and edit the notes along with syncing them to your account. \nThis is very helpful when using separate Apple IDs.\niCloud: Share notes on iCloud.com \n\nA: The workaround I found is this:\nLet's say W is your work iCloud account.\nAnd, let's say P is your personal iCloud account.\nNow, to access your \"notes on W\" \"from P\" what you can do is:\nPut all your notes in a folder called \"Shared\".\nQuick tip: you can simply drag and drop your folders as well as individual notes inside the Shared folder.\nThen, click on options for the shared folder and share it with \"P\".\nOnce sharing is activated, \"P\" is going to receive an invitation link on the Mail client. If the invitation link is not received, then simply copy the link for the folder that gets generated after sharing is activated on your Shared folder while on the Notes app for W.\nOnce the link is copied, save it online on https://www.protectedtext.com/\nBelieve me, it's a really good website to securely store and share your information. I don't store info that is way too confidential anyway just for the sake of safety.\nNow, on your other device, where you are logged in with P account. Open up safari and head onto the protectedtext.com website where you have saved the link and then click on the link. The link is going to open up on your Notes app in your Mac. And once it opens up, you would be successfully joined on the \"Shared\" folder by W.\nNow, W and P can work on inside the Shared folder and their changes are going to sync across.\nNote that: W is the owner of the folder, so only W can add more people.\nNote that: If P deletes the files, the files will be delted on W's end as well.\nBut if you don't want that to happen. You can create a copy of the folders and files inside the shared folder and make P the owner of it. To do that, simply select the folder for which you want P to be the owner of and then drag it outside the Shared folder. Let's say if the folder you selected was \"A\". Then, now you will have a copy of the A folder within Notes of which P will be the owner while you still have the original A folder inside the Shared folder which both W and P can work on but W is the owner of.\nSorry, it's boring enter image description here. You may not be looking for this but I thought this might help you and many others.\nCheers!!\nP.S. Option clicking and dragging a folder called A inside folder called B is going to copy and paste the folder A inside the folder B. However, doing the same inside the default \"Notes\" folder will not copy and paste folder A inside folder called \"Notes\".\n\n\nOpen that link from a device signed in with P.\nSharing is done.\nCopying and pasting using option click and drag is rest of the things.\n", "Q: Using Automator to script an arbitrary scriptable application Is it possible to use Automator to script an arbitrary scriptable application the way it is possible to load the application's dictionary to Script Editor and use AppleScript to script it?\n\nA: If I understood what you want...\nWhat you got on the left side of Automator (Action Library) is basically that. \nHere you can see an example of Transmit Automator Action showing up in the menu.\n\nIf you can't find application Actions there, then it's likely that the application doesn't support Automator. In my personal experience, not many applications do.\nAlthough sometimes they fail to show up in automator. If that happens, I'd check the application contents (right click > show contents) and find a folder that contains the automator actions. You can then just open the files and Automator should open up and ask if you want to install the actions. It should move the actions to  ~/Library/Automator/\n\nAutomator is often used to create a trigger for scripts, since it's more common for applications to have Applescript support. Alternatively you can just force things to happen in the application by navigating the application menu with a script or triggering shortcut keys the application supports. Of course you can also use countless other applications for triggering scripts, it doesn't have to be Automator.\n", "Q: iPhone 6s backup and restore from iTunes My iPhone 6S had an intermittent issue with the touch screen that was not responding to touch.\nI backed it up using iTunes version 12.6.0.100 to my laptop.\niPhone was on version 10.2.1 when it was backed up.\niStore replaced the phone with one that also had 10.2.1 installed on it.\nI tried to restore the backup to the new iPhone and got this message:\n\niTunes could not restore the iPhone \"xxxx\" because the backup was\n  corrupt or not compatible with the iPhone that is being restored.\n\nI took the phone and computer to the store and they loaded iOS 10.3.1 and said that this was the problem.\nHowever, updating iOS did not fix the problem.\nI still cannot restore the backup to the new iPhone.

Sometimes there are glitches in the backup that cause it to be corrupt, and we fix those issues to make a version of the backup that is restorable in iTunes again.\nBefore getting to our software though, I would double check a few more things, such as trying a different cable, usb port, etc, just in case, if you have extras handy.\n", "Q: connecting my laptop to iPhone HotSpot using Ethernet adapter Can someone suggest an adapter to connect to iPhone hotspot through Ethernet data cable?\nWireless hardware in my laptop has stopped working and I am using Ethernet cable to connect to Internet. But once in a while, I want to use it outside and I am looking for some kind of hardware to connect to iPhone HotSpot. \nI looked at IOGEAR Universal Ethernet to Wi-Fi N Adapter and it could have worked but their customer support said they have had problems to connect to hotspot and they haven't tried iPhone hotspot yet.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UAKCS6/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_YL-9ybAKFN7NK\n\nA: How to Use Your iPhone’s Personal Hotspot to Tether on Windows and macOS\nFirst of all: not every cellular carrier includes this feature in every plan. If your cellular data plan doesn’t allow for tethering, you may not see the Personal Hotspot option at all on your iPhone’s settings screen. You may have to pay extra to gain access to it.\nSecond, it’s important to remember that when you use your iPhone as a data connection, you are using your mobile data plan and as such, if you have a data cap, then it will count towards that. If you have unlimited data or a large cap, then this might not trouble you, but you’ll otherwise want to be mindful of what you’re using you computer for when connected to your iPhone as a hotspot.\nEven if you have unlimited data, there’s a good chance you have a limited amount of tethering data — or, at least, high-speed tethering data. Your carrier may charge you extra if you need more tethering data. Check your cellular plan for more details about your plan’s hotspot, or tethering, capabilities.\nLastly, Wi-Fi tethering will also drain your phone’s battery more quickly. I recommend connecting your iPhone to a power source–or plug it into your laptop via USB cable–while tethering. Be sure to disable the hotspot when you’re not using it, too.\n\nHow to Turn On Your iPhone’s Personal Hotspot\nAs the wireless hardware in your laptop has stopped working, there are two ways to connect to your iPhone and use its data connection: Bluetooth, and USB. When you turn Personal Hotspot on, it will allow you to use any of these three options–you don’t need to alter any settings.\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app and tap Personal Hotspot to access the\nPersonal Hotspot settings.\n\n*Turn Personal Hotspot on using the switch along the top of the\nPersonal Hotspot settings.\n\nNext, it’s time to connect to your hotspot on your laptop using Bluetooth, or USB.\n\nConnect to Your Hotspot via Bluetooth\nUSB is faster than Bluetooth, but if you’d prefer to use Bluetooth to connect to your hotspot, you can do that too.\nOn Windows\nTo connect via Bluetooth from a Windows computer:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Bluetooth icon in the system tray and select Join\na Personal Area Network.\n\n*Click “Add a Device” in the upper-left corner.\n\n*Choose your iPhone from the resulting screen and click Next to\ncontinue. (Like any other Bluetooth connection, you’ll be shown a pair code on your computer and your iPhone.)\n\n*Compare the two passcodes, and if they are the same, tap Pair on your iPhone’s screen and Yes on the Windows pair screen. (Allow your Windows machine to install the necessary files on your system.)\n\n*Right-click on your iPhone to connect it as an access point. You’re\nready to surf the Internet, check e-mail, chat, and so on.\n\nOn macOS\n\n*\n\n*Head to System Preferences > Bluetooth, find your iPhone in the\nlist, and click Pair next to your iPhone. (You’ll be shown a pair code on your Mac’s screen and on your iPhone.)\n\n\n*If the codes match, tap the Pair button to confirm the connection.\n\n\n*From your Mac’s menu bar, click the Bluetooth symbol, then highlight your iPhone in the list, and click Connect to Network.\nYou’ll now be able to access the Internet through your iPhone’s Bluetooth connection.\n\n\n*When you want to disconnect, click the Bluetooth symbol once more,\nhighlight your iPhone, and then Disconnect from Network.\n\nConnect to Your Hotspot with a USB Cable\nConnecting via USB is by far the easiest method to tether your phone. As long as you have your Personal Hotspot turned on, all you need to do is:\n\n*\n\n*Plug your phone in with a USB cable and you should be good to go.\n\nOn Windows\nOn our Windows’ network adapters, we can see we’re connected via Apple Mobile Device Ethernet.\nOn macOS\nOn our Mac, we can see in the Network settings that our iPhone is connected through our USB connection.\n\nWhich Method Is Best?\nUSB is the fastest but most inconvenient, requiring your iPhone to be physically connected to the computer. Still, it’s super simple to set up, requiring zero configuration.\nBluetooth is the slowest of the two, also requiring the most configuration, though once it’s done, you don’t have to worry about it again.\n\nA: Just for grins and giggles, I thought I'd give this a try and I could not get it to work.\nHardware was an iPhone 8 running iOS 13.3, Apple Lightning to USB 3 camera adapter, power from a third party power brick, Apple USB to Ethernet adapter, with an Ethernet cable to an older MacBook with built-in Ethernet.  Cellular service is from AT&T if that matters.\nI was able to get a hotspot working fine with a Lightning to USB cable to the same laptop so I know the hotspot function works.  To set up the test I disabled WiFi and Bluetooth on the iPhone and MacBook to avoid either device from looking elsewhere for the internet.  I verified a live Ethernet connection between the two by pinging the iPhone from the laptop.\nAfter verifying that the hotspot function didn't work I wanted to check that the Ethernet would do more than a ping.  I set up the laptop to share WiFi internet on Ethernet to the iPhone and the iPhone was able to load web pages, with airplane mode enabled to assure it didn't connect by other means.\nWhen enabling the hotspot function on the iPhone it did report that it was sharing the internet by USB-only, Ethernet was not mentioned.  Checking the settings on the Ethernet port I saw no IP address configured when left as auto-configure.  Internet sharing still did not work when I tried manual configuration.\nI don't know if anyone cares about this anymore as I am resurrecting a zombie thread.  I was looking on if others tried this and I found this thread.  My intention on doing this was to ditch my poorly performing cable internet and instead use an old iPhone 7 for internet, to avoid having to tether my iPhone 8 every time and wanting Ethernet so I can share it on multiple wired computers without having to dedicate a computer for routing the internet.  It looks like if I do go with cellular internet at home then I'll have to stick with WiFi and USB from the iPhone, and anything on a wire would have to be connected by USB to the iPhone directly or have a computer in the middle to route from the iPhone to Ethernet.\nUnless I missed something important somewhere I guess I have my answer.  I just thought I'd share my experimental results since so far it looked like educated guessing, and some time has passed which may have changed the result.  So, thanks and I hope this helps.\n", "Q: Pay for iCloud with Apple Pay iPhone 6\nThe credit card in iPhone's iCloud Settings/Apple ID/Payment & Shipping/Payment Method (Payment Details) has just expired. I received a new card ( new expiration date and verification code) and entered it into Apple Pay a few weeks ago.\nNow I've misplaced the new credit card, so I can't update the iCloud payment method for that card. I can enter a different credit card number, of course. But why can't I pay for iCloud with Apple Pay?\n\nA: The real answer is because Apple Pay stores the card info locally on your phone/watch. That's why when you get a new device, you need to re-sync and re-setup all your cards.\nIn contrast, iCloud subscription is billed directly from Apple's servers with whatever payment method they have on file. They don't have access to the card in your Apple Pay which is stored securely on your individual devices.\nIn the article about Comcast posted by oa- in the other answer, the actual thing Comcast is allowing users to do is to open their app and make a bill payment from the phone using the Apple Pay card stored on that phone. It still doesn't allow reoccurring automatic payments, because it can't.\n\nA: While it may seem natural to select Apple Pay as your payment method for iCloud, it is not possible to do so.\nApple Pay is meant to be a payment solution for single transactions.\niCloud storage upgrades are reoccurring payments and thus can not be used with Apple Pay.\nThere are some instances where Apple Pay can be used for reoccurring payments, but it has to be enabled explicitly by the seller.

How do I get those playlists from old Mac to new Mac (and ensure the songs are placed in the playlists)?\n\nA: Save a copy of your playlists from iTunes on macOS\nYou can export a playlist—for example, if you want to save a copy of the playlist, or import it to a different computer so you have the same playlist in both places.\nYou can also export information about a song (or songs) to use in a database or in another app.\nWhen you export playlists or transfer song information, the actual songs or videos aren’t included—just the information about them or the playlist.\nSave copies of playlists or use playlists on another computer\nDo any of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Save a copy of a single playlist or use it in iTunes on another computer: Select the playlist, choose File > Library > Export Playlist, and choose XML from the Format pop-up menu.\n\n\n*Import an iTunes playlist: Choose File > Library > Import Playlist. The imported playlist includes only songs and videos already in your iTunes library.

I can go into Recovery Mode and Safe Boot Mode and my computer runs normally too but the one thing that I can't do is I can't go into startup manager, I've tried to hold the alt key before and after the power on and nothing happens.\nNote: I've upgraded my stock graphics card to a newer one so when I boot I don't see the apple logo because the graphics card takes a while to start up, normally, I turn on my mac and hear the chime and wait for it to turn on but my monitor doesn't run, I just have to wait until the initialization has finished for the graphics card to finally start running and my monitor working. When I turn on my mac and hold down alt to get to the startup manager the computer starts up normally but my screen won't turn on and I can't hear my graphics cards fan running which is usually an indication that the start up is almost done so my computer says it's on, my graphics card isn't doing anything and holding alt is useless even for the longest times, I have a feeling it's at the startup manager but my graphics card is still asleep, I can boot normally after a restart.\nIf there's a solution to this or an alternative method to help me boot from my USB, Its been quite frustrating.\n\nA: Are you using a wireless keyboard? To boot from USB  you will need a wired keyboard. \nFrom Safe Boot Mode, or even from Recovery Mode, you can try to undo recent changes in the system, like the installation or removal of a kernel extension related to the graphics card. If that graphics card is one of the officially supported models, you can also  try to reinstall the operating system from Recovery Mode, without erasing the disk.\n\nA: I've been in the same situation with the same model machine. The best I can tell is that you've triggered the boot manager in the startup sequence, but without a recognized display device it gets stuck and you have to power cycle the machine to get out of it. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that you can blindly hit arrow keys and 'return' to choose startup devices without a supported display.\nThe only way I've found that I can boot from another device (HDD or USB) is that you have to do it from the System Preferences -> Startup Disk applet and then reboot. If you end up in a situation that it is stuck booting a disk that won't bring up your display, you have to do the PRAM reset to bring it back to defaults and reboot.\n", "Q: After resetting default keychain, I cannot connect to Wi-Fi I used at that time I was going to install vim on Xcode; and I saw I've gotta reset default keychains (or something like this; system language is not set to English) and I did so.\nThe wireless access point I connected when I reset keychain stopped working; but other aps work as usual. The system says it cannot connect to Wi-Fi network and suggests to start diagnosis.\nThe diagnosis didn't give me any solution and I have no idea to solve this. Other computers successfully work with that Wi-Fi though. How can I get my computer connected to Wi-Fi?\n\nA: When you reset your keychain you are actually discarding the saved password for websites and wifi networks. So, unless you are able to retrieve the old keychain in the Keychain app, I am attains you will need to enter those passwords again. \nYou can also check if you have enabled the option iCloud Keychain in Preferences > iCloud, in case you have used it before. It stores passwords in iCloud. So if you have disabled this inadvertently, maybe you can make it work by reenabling that feature.\n", "Q: iTunes library .xml vs. .itl I have iTunes 12.6. I read that after 12.2 iTunes doesn't create .xml to store playlists. Is the .itl the same thing?  Will it have my playlists?  I tried importing the library.itl to my new computer, but nothing happened.  How do I get my playlists to a new computer when using iTunes 12.2 or later?\n\nA: It sounds like the reason you've run into problems is that you've tried to manually migrate across your iTunes data from your Time Machine Backup.\nWithout knowing exactly what you did, if you copied the entire iTunes folder from your TM backup to your new Mac, one thing you can try is to tell iTunes where that folder was copied to. To do this you would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Go to iTunes > Preferences (or just press command,)\n\n*Select the Advanced tab\n\n*Now you'll see an option where you can set your iTunes Media Folder location\n\n\nMigration Assistant\nSince you're migrating to a new Mac, you'd probably be better off starting again and using Migration Assistant to transfer all your data across. This will give you the option of migrating what you choose from a Time Machine backup or directly from your other Mac (if you have a way of connecting to it). Migration Assistant also provides other options.\nTo use Migration Assistant:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your new Mac, open Migration Assistant (by default it's in your Applications > Utilities folder)\n\n*If you happen to have another user logged in, you'll be prompted to log them out first. If not, you'll see an Introduction screen instead.\n\n*Click on Continue\n\n*You may be prompted to enter your password - if so enter it and click OK\n\n*You'll now be asked how you'd like to transfer your data.\n\n*Select the option applicable to you (most likely the first one which allows you to transfer from a Time Machine backup)\n\n*Click Continue\n\n*Follow the prompts to migrate the data you want\n\n\nNote: This process may take some time.\nFor more information see Move your content to a new Mac.\n", "Q: Increase the time of the pmset countdown Is there a way to change the delay time until a scheduled sleep/restart/shutdown occurs? It starts at 10 minutes (10:00), but I want to change it to 30 minutes (30:00).\n\nAs you can see above, the computer is scheduled to restart in 10 minutes via pmset.\n\nA: As far as I'm aware there's no way to change this value because a Mac must be awake for at least 10 minutes past the scheduled time. It's because of this that the 10 minute value is set and cannot be altered, although I suppose there's no reason why it couldn't be extended beyond that (such as the 30 mins you want). Regardless, I'm not aware that this can be done.\nAccording to Apple:\n\nTo shut down automatically, your Mac must be awake at the time that\n  it's scheduled to shut down, and remain awake for at least 10 minutes\n  past that time. If it's sleeping at the scheduled shutdown time, it\n  continues sleeping instead of shutting down. If it's set to go to\n  sleep after less than 15 minutes of inactivity, it might go back to\n  sleep before it can shut down. To make sure that your Mac shuts down\n  even when sleeping, set it to start up or wake 5 minutes before the\n  scheduled shutdown time.\n\nSource: Set a startup, wake, sleep, restart, or shutdown time on your Mac\nOne thing you could do is check the man page for pmset on your system to double-check, as different versions of the OS will provide different options (and sometimes particular hardware can offer different options depending on it's type and location).\nTo check the man page for pmset on your system, launch the terminal and enter man pmset.

If any are found, this will be your problem (or at least part of it), so you will need to resolve this.\nIf no issues are found, then proceed below.\nExport a Developer ID-signed app\n\n\n*\n\n*Still within the Archives organizer window, select the archive for the app in question\n\n*Click on the Export button\n\n*A dialogue box appears asking you to select a method for export\n\n*Select the Export a Developer ID-signed Application option\n\n*Click on Next\n\n*In the next window select a team from the pop-up menu\n\n*Click on Choose\n\n*Click the Export button\n\n\nOnce your app is exported you should test with Gatekeeper enabled and again with Gatekeeper disabled.\n", "Q: How to create an index.html page with a web address In Windows there is an option to allow you create an index.html file which opens a specific web address when clicked on it. How can I create a similar file in Mac?\nI want to have a file called index.html and when clicked, a web address www.example.com should open in the default browser. \n\nA: If you are determined to use an HTML file, you can create one with a text editor (e.g. the built-in TextEdit; make sure you use the Plain Text view rather than the Rich Text which is the default).\nYour HTML file should contain a so-called meta-refresh tag for this:\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; url=http://www.example.com/\" />\n\nThe page will automatically redirect upon loading.\nAlternatively, because this sounds like an XY-problem: create a shortcut to the page on your Desktop, as described by Joonas.\n\nA: Drag favicon from a browser to the desktop or into Finder.\nThis creates a .webloc file, which will open in the default browser when opened.\n\nIn some sites you may have to drag the lock icon, info icon... or whatever is on the immediate left from the site url in the address bar. You may also try selecting the url and dragging that, but that doesn't work in Chrome at least, I believe.\n\nWorks in Safari, Chrome and Firefox\n\nI should also mention that you should be able to do this with any link elements in a website as well.

Is this a bug or is there somewhere else I should look to delete this 30.15GB of data?\n\n\n\nA: Be patient. It takes some time for the Mac to rebuild the index that determines the (exact) size of each section.\nKeep a mobile Mac connected to a power source if you want to accelerate the process.\nYou could also rebuild the spotlight cache, but it's barely worth it just to update the view.\n", "Q: How can you change the iCloud account name on iOS 10?

Nobody can delete it, except root, can somebody help me or tell me a better idea to prevent a user from deleting a file?\n\nA: You did need permission — Finder asked you for your password and you provided it. That gave Finder permission to use root access to delete the file, because the staff group are in sudoers.\n", "Q: Wallpaper not switching with desktop I have issue with wallpaper. When I am switching desktop, wallpaper is not moving along but \"stays under\". killall Dock fixes this but recently it is occurring so often that it became annoying.\n\nWhat could be issue? Is there permanent solution?\n\nA: It's not obvious to me why the killall Dock command would help with this, but since it does it may be worth you doing a reset and restart of the Dock.\nReset and restart the Dock\nIf you go ahead with resetting and restarting the Dock you will need to re-add any non-default icons to your Dock. (I usually find it's a good opportunity for people to start afresh and only add things as they actually use them).\nTo reset and restart the Dock follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder\n\n*Press and hold the option key down\n\n*Now go to the Go menu\n\n*Select the Library option to open the User's Library folder. You can let go of the option key now.\n\n*Go to the Preferences folder (i.e. within the Library folder)\n\n*Find and move the com.apple.dock.plist file to the Trash\n\n*Now open Terminal (usually located in Applications > Utilities)\n\n*Enter this command killall -KILL Dock\n\n*Press enter\nRemember you'll need to re-add some apps back to the Dock.\nIf this doesn't resolve your issue, it'd be worth also testing what happens when you're booted into Safe Mode and afterwards again.

Is it possible for a third party app to access macOS's clipboard content?\nI am asking in relation to copy & paste sensitive data such as passwords and sensitive file content.\n\nA: Any process with sufficient permissions can read your clipboard at any time, and you can't easily prevent this. Security is always a trade-off with usability, and this is the choice that most (but not all) OSes take when implementing the clipboard.\nSome apps that store sensitive data (e.g. 1Password) implement a timeout such that any information you copy out of that application is cleared from the clipboard a short time later. If you'd like to do something like that globally, you could look at the answers to this previous question for ideas.\n\nA: No security for data that is in one of the system clipboards is possible by design. This appears to be changing with 2020 features in publicly announced betas where Apple potentially will notify us each time an app copies content out of the clipboard. Some very common apps appear to be abusing the privilege and even if your password manager clears the contents quickly, this could easily be abused to steal keystrokes and passwords or other sensitive data.\nThe macOS clipboard is a public billboard open to all processes. Clipboard is the mechanism to let all apps read / modify shared data.\nPractically you can Either restrict your set of apps installed to those you trust with the data you put in the clipboard or don't restrict sensitive content by never placing it into the clipboard so that the least trusted app only gets data you can permit it to see / log / capture / exfiltrate.\nFrom here, the rabbit hole for developers and security minded people using macOS begins with an overview of secure text input options within programs to prevent key loggers in addition to pasteboard snoopers from grabbing secure input:\n\n*\n\n*Technical Note TN2150: Using Secure Event Input Fairly\n\n*insecure keyboard entry - a blog post by Daniel Jalkut\n\n*How secure is “Secure Keyboard Entry” in Mac OS X's Terminal?\n\n*https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/\nThere are some things you can do, however, to mitigate this.

I'm trying to track down the .icns files for these icons:\n\nAny ideas?

Note that there are several .car files in the Resources folder, however looking at the open files for Mail.app in Activity Monitor, there are .car archives outside of the application bundle that are open as well, e.g.:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/VibrantLightAppearance.car\n/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/SystemAppearance.car\n/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/Assets.car\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AccountsUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Assets.car\n/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources/FunctionRowAppearance.car\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Check in Activity Monitor on your system for a complete list of open files for Mail.app.\n\n\nDoing a few Google searches, I found a few different apps, both GUI and CL, and had mixed results in both viewing and extracting assets from the .car archives. However, that was using only precompiled programs, and there are a few Xcode Projects I didn't test.\nThe one in the image below is ThemeEngine and while is actually showed more objects then Asset Catalog Tinkerer did, and opened some .car files that Asset Catalog Tinkerer couldn't, the drawback is ThemeEngine doesn't have an export function like Asset Catalog Tinkerer did. However, I could still copy and paste out of ThemeEngine though. Maybe the Xcode Projects would work better if I compiled then on my system, but just don't have the time to try.\n\n\nA: Go to the Applications folder, right click on the Mail icon, click on the \"Show Package Contents \", double click the \"Contents\" folder, double click the \"Resources\" folder.

A few releases of macOS (Mac OS X) ago, many native apps (such as Preview, TextEdit, etc) changed their closing dialog options from \"Don't Save\", \"Cancel\", and Save\"…\n\n…to \"Revert Changes\", \"Cancel\", and \"Save\".\n\nThe former set of options is still available in most third-party apps, as shown in the first screenshot above. \n\"Don't Save\" and \"Revert Changes\" do the same thing, but the former set of options can be activated from the keyboard via commandd, esc, and return, whereas the latter has no shortcut for \"Revert Changes\" (as far as I can tell). \nCall me picky, but this renders the native apps nearly worthless. \nHas anyone yet found a way to activate \"Revert Changes\" from the keyboard, rather than having to use the trackpad to click the button? \nI've tried mashing various key-combinations into the keyboard.

I tried using the find and replace template in Automator but it simply wasn't working with copied text.

If it is, it pipes the output of the printf command to pbcopy, which writes to the clipboard. You can add this to an AppleScript and have it repeat with:\nrepeat\n    do shell script \"[[ $(pbpaste) == \\\"10.10.8.24\\\" ]] && printf \\\"192.168.10.11\\\" | pbcopy; exit 0\"\n    delay 1\nend repeat\n\n(You have to doctor it up a bit with the \\ and ; exit 0 so it runs in AppleScript, but this should check every second and replace the clipboard)\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina 2015 heating up I have MacBook Pro 13' Retina 2015. When I connect the charger the magnet connector heats up, but when charging is complete and the green light comes on everything is normal with no heat.\nAlso, when I am using the Mac whether on battery or while on charge, the area above the fans heat up too - especially when using Google Chrome. Other times it wont heat up.  \n\nA: I've had similar issues. A laptop stand seemed to help. \n\nA: At the risk of oversimplifying things, when your MBP is charging it needs to receive enough power from the AC outlet in order to charge the battery. However, when charging is complete and if the MBP is still connected to AC power, the charging process effectively goes into a float phase where it just keeps your battery charged and does not require the same amount of power coming through. So, it makes perfect sense that while charging there will be more heat as compared to while it's floating (for want of a better word).\nIf the heat while charging seems excessive to you (or you're just concerned about it), you can reset the System Management Controller (SMC). To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter doing this, use your computer for a while (incl.

The latest iMovie version is v10.1.5 and the minimum system requirement is OS X 10.11.2 or later. When you open iMovie, it may inform you that there is a update on the MAS, but it also asks you to update the OS.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 15\" Late 2011 - Swap HDD with SSD - Fan always 2000 rpm I installed a HDD+SSD setup on this MacBook Pro 15\" Late 2011.\nAt first I installed the SSD where the Superdrive was with an optical bay HDD caddy, but then I saw in System Informations -> SATA that while the speed link was 6 Gigabit, the negotiated speed was 3 Gigabit.\nSo I swapped the location of the HDD and SSD putting the HDD in the caddy. I was getting much better performances (booting Sierra in 18 seconds, instead of 30 seconds when it was in the Superdrive location).\nThe problem is, as soon as I make the smallest action (like opening Finder), the fans start going at 2000 RPM (which seems to be the minimum speed on this machine) and you can always hear them in background.\nWhen I leave the MBP alone for 10 minutes, it becomes quiet again (you can't hear anything) but as soon as I start the simplest application, there go the fans at 2000 RPM.\nThat's strange because my other MacBook Pro (Mid 2010) is always quiet while I work, you start hearing the fans only under load.\nWhat I already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting NVRAM and SMC\n\n*Using all popular fan control programs\n\n*Checking the temperatures (always very low)\n\n\nSierra is a clean installation. What am I missing?\nOne thing that I like in Macs is that you never hear the fans while you work. I'd like it to be like that.\n\nA: You most likely have a malfunctioning sensor, and it's not necessarily restricted to the CPU.\nThere are sensors for ambient air, the heat sink/pipe, the palm rest, the CPU, the GPU, the hard drive, etc.  Any/all of these could be malfunctioning (or detecting) a malfunction to cause the SMC to spin up your fan.\nTo diagnose this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Return your MacBook Pro to it's original configuration.  If the problem goes away, then you know it's due to an issue that was introduced due to the modification.\n\n*Run Apple Diagnostics.  Regardless if the problem goes away in the previous step, run Apple Hardware Test (AHT).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.    If there is an problem, this tool will likely tell you what the issue is (if there is one).\n\n\n*\n\n*No issue - you have a good baseline to start working with\n\n*Issue - you will have a diagnostic code to start working with to solve the problem\n\n\n*Install the SSD in the HDD location.  Since this is your objective, this is the next logical step.  If you encounter issues here, it's related to the SSD installation.  You will want to run AHT here again to verify all is well.\n\n*Install the HDD in the optical bay caddy.  This being your final step, install it and check performance.  Run AHT again. Verify that you don't get any issues.\nThe key here is to do each step individually to see where something could have gone wrong.  It's also entirely plausible with the disconnection/reconnection of components something wasn't connected properly.  Double check your work. Double check that you didn't accidentally knock something loose.\nA note on the inner workings of your MBP\n\n\n*\n\n*The fans never stop, they are always spinning.  1000 RPM is typically the lowest speed.  \n\n*Fans spin up because a sensor indicated there was a temp spike and the SMC responded by spinning up the fan\n\n*Controlling the fan is a bad idea.  Fans remove heat that's generated by the different components.  If the fan can't remove the heat (quickly enough) it will throttle your CPU to generate less heat.  \n\n\nWhen you control the fan, you treat the symptom.  If you really must have it quiet, treat the cause and lower your CPU speed, thereby reducing the heat, the fans will follow.  You will sacrifice performance but not endanger your CPU.\n\nA: Although the way this question is phrased, three points would need or profit from clarification. But that is also part of what you are missing: \n\n\n*\n\n*2000rpm is the minimal fan speed for this model. They should always spin at this level at least. How is the fan speed measured? Sensors can be defect and then do not report what is the case. Abnormal value readings might be indicative of a defective sensor.\n\n*2000–2500rpm should be almost inaudible to all but the youngest ears very close to the fans. How 'loud' do the fans get in terms of rpm? A Mac that has settled from re-installation (i.e. no more Spotlight indexing) should usually settle to quite 'cool' (~60°C internal CPU-die sensor) and quite quiet fans (2000 rpm, with this model: almost inaudible).\n\n*How do you measure the temperatures and how many sensors do you read out? What is 'normal' or \"always very low\" in degrees Celsius?\nWhat you are missing is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Graphics switching. Depending on several settings and your version of the operating system your discrete GPU might get switched on and produce quite a bit of heat even if you wouldn't suspect it doing very heavy 3D related actions. Such is for example the case when an external monitor is just plugged in or an otherwise innocent looking application just requests it explicitly.\n\n*A \"clean install\" is not necessarily a \"clean install that has not seen Migration Assistant\" (MA). MA might have brought over background tasks, or settings that cause too much load. Even if MA wasn't used you should also check Activity Monitor and Console for abnormal demands on the processing power available.\n\n*In addition to what you have tried already you should also re-check the hardware. That machine is getting relatively old now and will have accumulated quite a bit of dust and other debris inside the hardware. The likelihood of dirty fans and fins on the cooling system is increased with every day in operation even in the cleanest of real environments possible. Other mechanical blocks within the cooling system are possible and should be addressed as well.\nTherefore: open the laptop up, just the bottom case, inspect the fans and fins. Even when installing an SSD means you opened it up before and should have seen gross abnormalities on the fans, the fins on the heat spreader are usually not diagnosable without shining a light through them after disassembling the fans to get a better view.\nIf they are dirty use a can of compressed air to clean both components while making sure the fans stay put and do not rotate from the blown air (just hold them down). While your at it: blow air through every nook and cranny, dust just has to be removed from every place in there.\n\n*Given the age of this system again it is also possible that other key parts in cooling the system have reached a point of trouble related to old age. \n\n\n*\n\n*The thermal compound on the heatsink might still be the original. That means first it was probably applied a bit too generously in the factory and therefore not performing optimally anyway. Thermal grease also looses a bit of its cooling characteristics over time. That would mean a thinly spread re-application of high quality thermal grease should bring a bit of betterment.    \n\n*The fans are mechanical – and getting old. It might simply be that they get louder while on  previously inaudibly shy levels of rotational speed. If they are too loud now for what they are supposed to be doing and clean: The fans are very easy to replace and not that expensive. Buy new ones.\n\n*Several other components on the logic board (like capacitors) are now known to be quite vulnerable to heat stress and might have gone bad, producing even more heat while they are dying.\n\n*The battery has to diagnosed separately and carefully.\n\n*These bullet points might be calling more for a specialist technician than those aspects before. –– Do not tinker with the hardware when you feel even in the slightest uncomfortable with what you are about to do.\n\n\n", "Q: Unmute specific app when iPhone is in silent mode I recently downloaded an app that tells me when someone in my direct area is in need of CPR (as I am an first aid worker). This app will sound an alarm to alert me, but this alarm is muted when I put my iPhone 4s in silent mode.\nIs there a way I can specifically unmute this app and keep the rest muted?\n\nA: Short answer:\nNo, that's not possible with third party apps.\n\nLong answer:\nThird party apps can not override the mute switch. It only works for Apple's own \"Find my iPhone\" app. The only possibility I know of is to jailbreak your phone and to use a tweak that lets you put some apps on a white list. Jailbreaking, however, is not recommended.\nYou may try to use \"Do not disturb\". It lets you add specific contacts to a favorites list. Only these contacts will ring with DND enabled.\n", "Q: Using iMessage with my phone number when I don't have an iPhone anymore Until recently, I was using iMessage on both iOS and macOS. Now, my phone is dead with a black screen, so I did a full erase from iTunes. (\"Find my iPhone\" and iCloud was turned off already.)\nCurrently, I am still able to use iMessage from macOS. My iMessage account is connected only to my phone number, not my email address, and I'd like to keep it that way.\nIf I don't buy a new iPhone, but a basic phone, can I use my phone number for iMessage on macOS forevermore? Or will this \"time out\"? What must I do to avoid running into a situation where I will be forced to have an iPhone to continue using iMessage with my phone number?\n\nA: I believe there is not gonna be a timeout. iMessage on macOS has no reason to ask you to log again once you already signed-in.\nHowever, I advise you to link a mail address, because in case your mac gets into trouble, I think you will have a hard time to get everything back with your phone number only.\nEdit: In that last case, I guess the Apple Support will be your friend.\n", "Q: MacOSX Installer signed but Gatekeeper complains My C++ daemon for MacOSX is being successfully signed with productbuild:\nproductbuild: Wrote product to Installers/app.pkg-unsigned\nproductsign: signing product with identity \"3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: myCompany\" from keychain key.keychain\nproductsign: adding certificate \"Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority\"\nproductsign: adding certificate \"Apple Root CA\"\nproductsign: Wrote signed product archive to Installers/app.pkg\n\nThe certificate I am using has been created by first creating an App ID for my daemon, then by requesting a Mac Installer Distribution certificate for the particular App ID.\nI can verify that the .pkg is signed with pkgutil --check-signature app.pkg, both with the fresh package file AND with the same package uploaded on Google Drive and then re-downloaded to simulate the download from an exteral site.

I am not sure if I am the only one who is facing this problem, but interesting thing is that my Iphone 5S(IOS 10.x.x) vibrates everyday 12 O'clock for several seconds and there is no way I can stop it. It is really annoying at work place. I checked if I have any alarm for 12 O'Clock, but I did not find one.\nAny clue does it happen and how to stop it? Thank you in advance!\n\nA: It could be anything from an alarm, to push notification from an app you have installed.  The best way to find out what it is, is check your Notification Center.  Pull the bar at the top down to see all your recent notifications. You should be able to see which one happened at 12 noon and take it from there.\n", "Q: Disable two-factor when I don't have an iPhone anymore Until recently, I was using iMessage on both iOS and macOS. Now, my phone is dead with a black screen, so I did a full erase from iTunes. (\"Find my iPhone\" and iCloud is disabled on both devices.)\nCurrently, I am still able to use iMessage from macOS. My iMessage account is connected only to my phone number, not my email address, and I'd like to keep it that way.\nMy Mac and iPhone has two-factor setup, so you confirm stuff with the other device other. Since I now don't have an iPhone, how do I disable two-factor without breaking iMessage or anything?\n\nA: Apple Support addresses this very scenario:\n\nWhat if I don’t have access to a trusted device or didn't receive a verification code?\nIf you're signing in and don’t have a trusted device handy that can\ndisplay verification codes, you can have a code sent to your trusted\nphone number via text message or an automated phone call instead.\nClick Didn't Get a Code on the sign in screen and choose to send a\ncode to your trusted phone number. You can also get a code directly\nfrom Settings on a trusted device. Learn how to get a verification\ncode.\n\nIf you trusted device is your iPhone and you say that it's connected to your phone number, this is a good thing.  What you will need is a (cheap) replacement phone that can receive calls/SMS (text messages).  Depending on your carrier (i.e AT&T or TMobile) you can just move your SIM card to another phone to receive the call/text message with the verification code.  If it's a carrier that doesn't use SIM cards (Verizon, Sprint), you will have to get them to activate the cheap phone for you.\nOnce you get the call/SMS, you can now validate your account to disable two-factor authentication.\nIf all else fails, you still have another option...\n\nIf you still can't sign in\nIf you can’t sign in, reset your password, or receive verification\ncodes, you can request account recovery to regain access to your\naccount. Account recovery might take a few days or longer, depending\non the specific account information you can provide to verify your\nidentity.\n\n\nA: At this writing it is not possible to disable two factor authentication if it has been enabled and two weeks have lapsed. I just ended a chat with Apple support seeking to do this, and was informed of this (but that it really is the best security option).\nhttps://www.apple.com/feedback/\nI never needed the option, it was a mistake to switch it on, and now I can't switch it off.\n\nA: You might want to try logging into iCloud and disable 2FA there, in the settings.

I typically have my work machine set to 'AppleShowAllFiles TRUE' so I notice that the shares are accumulating '.smbdelete...' files. These are hidden for most users, but they are getting a little annoying for me because the file listing of one share in particular is getting long.

So the following tweak is needed for the accepted answer:\n# assuming you have the backup disk connected & root privileges:\n# get the latest backup to exclude from deletion\nlatest=$(sudo tmutil latestbackup)\n# the 4th line after the last space from `tmutil destinationinfo` output\n# contains the mount disk name\nmountpoint=$(tmutil destinationinfo | sed '4q;d' | sed 's/.* //')\necho \"latest is $latest\"\n# delete all the backups excluding the latest\nbackups=$(sudo tmutil listbackups)\necho $backups | while read timestamp; do\n    if [[ \"$timestamp\" != \"$(basename $latest)\" ]]; then\n        echo sudo tmutil delete -d $mountpoint -t $timestamp\n    fi\ndone\n\n# if you want to keep the last, say, 3 backups, pipe \"sed '$d'\" 3-1=2 times:\nbackups=$(sudo tmutil listbackups | sed '$d' | sed '$d')\n\nIt should look like sudo tmutil delete -d /Volumes/TimeMachineBackups -t 2021-04-10-004103.\n", "Q: Having Automator send downloaded files to DEVONThink I'm trying to do this with Automator:  I want to keep my Downloads folder always empty and as I use DEVONthink I would like to send them to DEVONthink. \nI can select the files but I don't know how to Right-click Send to Devon-Inbox.  I tried recording actions to make a Watch Me Do, but the files are not being copied.  Just selected and then deleted from the download folder. \n\nA: This Folder Action will automatically import any files that are downloaded into your Downloads folder into your DT database.\nCreate a Folder Action in Automator and after pointing it to your 'Downloads' folder add the following Actions to it: \nGet Folder Contents\n Set Current Group (and then select the desired folder within your DT database) \nAdd Items to Current Group\nIf you wish to take a more manual approach, you could create a 'service' in Automator with the following actions: \nGet Specified Finder Items (and then 'Add…' your Downloads folder) \nGet Folder Contents \nSet Current Group (and then select the desired folder within your DT database) \nAdd Items to Current Group (and then select 'import')\nYou can then right-click the Downloads folder and run this from the Services sub-menu. You could also add a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services.\nNB For the ‘get specified’ action, you may need to check the ‘ignore this action’s input’ or get duplicates. Set as follows: 'Service receives selected ‘folders’ in ‘Finder’’.\nAs an alternative, you could substitute ‘get selected finder items’ for the ‘get specified…’ above. Then select all the items in the Downloads folder when you run the service. This would allow you to ignore some files if you don’t actually want to import them to DT. \nYou have a few options depending upon how you would prefer it to work. For example, you could add a ‘Move Finder Items to Trash’ action which would presumably trash the files after importing them into DT.\n\n", "Q: Screen doesn't work properly - iPhone SE I have an iPhone SE in almost perfect conditions (I never dropped it).

The problem happened at least 1 time per hours and I already tried to clean the screen and restart my iPhone, do you have any ideas?\n\nA: If you have a screen protector or case on your phone, try removing them as that may be your issue.\nOtherwise, it's most likely a hardware issue.

Since 10.10 the sync between Chrome and MacOS Keychain stopped working for me.\nIs there any trick to make this work again?\n1Password or other 3rd party password managers are currently no option for me, as I don't trust their security. (see here or here)\n\nA: I found this:\n\nYou can no longer share Google Chrome passwords with iCloud Keychain.\n  Google Chrome 45 was the last one that could do it. Since then its\n  been removed as an option.\nPerhaps reaching out to Google Support and giving them something to\n  pass on to the devs for Chrome for Mac could inspire something.\nUntil they replace it, I recommend using a 3rd Party option since they\n  work with nearly every platform and device type. Such as LastPass,\n  Dashlane, Roboform, Keepass, 1Password, Privacy, GNOME keyring, etc.\nThey may work with Keychain and gather passwords saved in Chrome.\n  Thats the only auto-sync solution that is available.\n\n\nA: open Safari ,click menu File->Import From->Google Chrome, select password and click import\n\nA: Unfortunately, I do not believe that there is an easy way to do this.  I think your only options are to either:\n1) Use a third-party manager after looking up reviews for it;\nor\n2) Whenever you make a new password, you input it into both Safari and Chrome.\n\nA: While it's true that you can't use the keychain in Chrome, I can suggest a solution that I've made.\nThe explanation involves some web dev, so skip to the end if this is too boring.\nThe extension has two parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*The extension itself.\n\n*A static website at https://winchpass.com that your iDevice opens.\n\n\nThe extension generates a QR code and you scan it with your regular iPhone camera.\nIt opens the static website (hosted at GH pages) with the necessary parameters in the query string.\nBecause the website is static, it receives no data.\nThe QR code URL also contains a one-time pad encryption key. This key is passed through the URL hash.  \nYou use the Keychain on your iPhone to enter the password, which is encrypted using the key and sent to the extension using WebSockets. The key is unusable after that. The built-in Safari functionality allows you to save the password for later reuse.\nYou can get it here: WinchPass - iCloud Keychain for Chrome\n\nA: You can use Apple Keychain passwords in Chrome on iOS (you cannot update them or create new ones from Chrome).\n", "Q: How to boot Mac from CD from verbose command line So already I've tried booting Ubuntu on a USB from the Mac's command line (verboes or something like that).

I can't open up the boot menu as all of the important drivers are gone from the computer.\n\nA: Mac hardware will always boot to an os chooser holding down the option key. You of course need a USB / thunderbolt / FireWire drive with bootable media at that point.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255\nNewer Macs use internet recovery to net boot and from there you can repartition any drives and reinstall all drivers needed to boot macOS and start again.\n\n*\n\n*Accessing Internet Recovery\nFor a PowerBook, you might also use cd / DVD media since internet recovery isn't an option for PPC hardware.\n", "Q: Are there keyboard shortcuts for emoji on a bluetooth keyboard for iOS? I've recently started using a bluetooth keyboard with my iPad. I was wondering if there are any keyboard shortcuts for emoji ? Switching to the on screen keyboard is possible but forces me to take my fingers off the hardware keyboard and tap the screen which is a huge waste of time. On Mac the autocorrect replaces stuff \"<3\" with their emoji equivalent but iOS doesn't seem to do that.\nRegards.\n\nA: I've found a workaround using the \"text replacement\" feature. In Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Text replacement, you can add the emoji and assign them their equivalent text-based shortcuts, like in the screenshot below.\n\n", "Q: Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable vs HDMI to HDMI I have MacBook Pro with Retina, and Iiyama Monitor that has HDMI input. Is there a difference (in performance or anything) between connecting MDP-HDMI cable into Mac's Thunderbolt and between using HDMI cable into Mac's HDMI output? I have both cables, but so far I am unable to tell what's the difference. I think that both options are actually HDMI's in the end, but I am not sure yet.\n\nA: Using your Thunderbolt/MDP connector just to convert HDMI will work, but will consume your Thunderbolt port. As DisplayPort is not compatible with HDMI, the cable will actually contain electronics to convert the DP signal to HDMI. While this does not downgrade the quality, it is another thing that can break, consumes power and costs more than a HDMI cable.\nYou should use the HDMI port to connect your display.\n", "Q: How to go back to list view of songs in playlists on iTunes 12.6 How do I get the old Songs list view within playlists on iTunes 12.6? Some of my playlists (whether old or new) are now showing up in the stupid huge list that shows the album cover and all kinds of extra crap, and I only have about 8 songs per screen that I can see at once without scrolling. How do I go back to just the text-only list view within individual playlists (not just the main library) in iTunes 12.6?\n\nA: View menu > View as.\nPick your favourite.\nPlaylist has 'mini covers' Songs is most minimal, text only.\nUnfortunately, it's not a global setting, it's per playlist.\n\nA: I don't know how to change the default view mode for new playlists, but you can run a script like the one below in Script Editor to change the view mode of all existing playlists.\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    repeat with p in user playlists\n        set view of browser window 1 to p\n        try\n            tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"iTunes\" to click menu item \"Songs\" of menu 1 of menu item \"View As\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"View\" of menu bar 1\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nWithout the try block the script above would exit with an error when it reaches a \"special\" playlist like the \"Songs\" view where the \"View > View As > Songs\" menu item does not exist. You can remove the try block if you replace user playlists with user playlists whose special kind is not none and smart is false. In my version of iTunes, tell application \"iTunes\" to name of user playlists whose special kind is not none returned {\"Music\", \"Movies\", \"TV Shows\", \"Podcasts\", \"iTunes U\", \"Audiobooks\", \"Purchased\"}.\nI use a script like the one below to create most new playlists.

(-1719).\n\nA: In iTunes using Mac, to make songs within a playlist in list view, simply click on the playlist you want, then click on View on the top menu, then click on As Songs, that gives you the list view.\n\nA: This has been frustrating me for years; how have they mimicked so many other (now standard) behaviors like navigation history, but not made views global? \nEssentially the closest thing I've read (and implemented) to solving this is loading a fresh install of iTunes, and creating the first list, then setting it all the preference on it, then in the future all lists will actually inherit the settings of the original list. \n", "Q: How to merge folders based on file content rather than filename I have multiple folders containing thousands of deletion-recovered files from multiple recovery scans.\nAs per usual with deletion recovery, the recovered files have different names than the originals, and different names from one recovery scan to another.\nSo, short of writing a custom program, is there a tool (or product) that can compare files by content and ignore the filenames?\nIdeally, it would allow deletion of recovered files when they content-match files in an \"original\" directory tree (e.g. iTunes library folders),\nand, allow merge of two folders based on file contents rather than filenames.\n\nA: Why wouldn't you have a script to loop over all the files and rename them with the value of a hash based on the file contents.\nmd5 file.png \nMD5 (file.png) = d5438a3187b73fa362dceb269e158908\ncrc32 file.png \n87a1ffdd\nshasum -a 256 file.png \n34d126a6990b59dd45a4d7d19e471943569060bc54cb3b42b3d0be1934f16f11  file.png\n\nI've listed these in order of fastest to slowest on my Mac - you should test for a few files if you can't just let the script run overnight and do care about performance of the script.\nThen you could merge based on file name since the same content would be the same name, barring any collisions in the space of the hash.\n\n\n*\n\n*When is CRC more appropriate to use than MD5/SHA1?\n", "Q: Activating Sierra Finder Window options In Finder in Sierra, in the menu Window, all options are disabled.

The brother supported Apple printers site shows the HL2030 model as unsupported on MacOS Sierra. I have tried Gutenprint which says it supports the HL2030, but it doesn't work, I think due to this bug. Is there anything else I can do?\n\nA: In the end I found that the official driver from the Brother site for the next model up - the HL2130 - worked fine. I don't know why they say they don't support the HL2030, but it seems to print OK so far.\n", "Q: Why does my cellular iPad not have the cellular capabilities? I’ve recently purchased an iPad Air advertised as ‘Wifi Only’ but it has the sim card tray & antenna. I’ve got the exact same model A1475 in a different storage capacity variant side-by-side with it, the model numbers match. Both are indeed Wifi + Cellular models.\nUsing Apple's site https://checkcoverage.apple.com and entering the serial number to check the service and support coverage of the devices, both are shown to be 'iPad Air WiFi, Cellular'\nThe serial numbers on the back of the devices match the serial number in ‘Settings->General->About’ for each device respectively.\nThe one lacking cellular capability also lacks the following fields in the ‘About’ section: Network, Carrier, Cellular Data Number, IMEI, ICCID, MEID, Modem Firmware. It does not have ‘Cellular Data’ or ‘Carrier’ in the first category of settings either as the older iPad does either, usually 'Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular Data, Carrier'.\nI've tried 2 different sim cards, both which work in my phone and other cellular iPad but there's absolutely no indication that it's been inserted or lack thereof.\nOther suggestion around the web and on the Apple forums indicate to restore the iPad, users have reported only WiFi firmware is compatible and resetting network settings (I've reset the entire device), all to no avail for other users either.\nBrowsing other forums I’ve learnt that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The software setting up the antenna may have failed during a software update therefore no longer has the cellular capability. (iPhones are not prone to this however)\n\n*The board within the device or certain components could have been removed in order to remove an iCloud lock that existed on the device.\nI picked up both second-hand for dirt-cheap prices and the newer iPad was originally advertised as ‘WiFi only’ anyway so there’s no issue with that, I would just like to find a way to resolve the issue is possible. I’d be grateful for any suggestions.\nEdit 01/06/2017\nI opened up the iPad and found that a cable from the sim card tray to the motherboard where the screen ICs are connected was unplugged. When turning the iPad on, it attempts to look for a signal (shows the 5 empty circles) but then changes to the text 'iPad' but without the pop-up that reads 'No sim card inserted'.\nI may have damaged the cable when inserting it, it was a mission to get in, that's probably why the last person who repaired it didn't put it into place.\n\nA: My wife had an iPhone 4 for a long time and at one stage the iPhone fell in some water.  We did all the usual tricks, turn it off, put it in rice, etc.   After a few days the phone was fine and worked as normal except the wifi never worked again.\nI would suspect something similar happened to this iPad.  The cellular module is probably damaged, for some reason or another, and doesn't work.  The seller most likely advertised it as Wifi Only so you couldn't complain back to them later.\n", "Q: Ubuntu dualboot alongside OS Sierra -- \"This computer currently has no detected operating system installed\" I am trying to install dual-boot Ubuntu 16.04 alongside OS Sierra.

However, in my case there are no other existing Apple components that might be interfering.\n\n\nAny suggestions on a fix?\n\nA: I found a solution which is a variant on this advice, which suggests extracting the files and installing the components manually in a particular order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract iTunes64Setup.exe (I used 7-zip)\n\n*Run AppleApplicationSupport64.msi\n\n*Run iTunes64.msi\nSuccess!

Following the update to iOS 10.3.1, my phone warned me (unnecessarily as it turned out) that I had too little space to store all my photos at full resolution, and suggested that I switch to \"optimized\" storage (which for those unfamiliar with the feature stores a uselessly blurry simulacrum of the original only), which I foolishly did.\n\nI immediately realized my mistake, and restored the \"Download and Keep Originals\" setting. But this appears to have had no effect. I still see only the placeholders, until I click on an individual photo and wait for it to download.\nSo the question is: what does \"Download\" mean? Does it mean\n\n\n*\n\n*download all photos automatically (e.g., in the background over time) or \n\n*download a photo only when it is viewed?\n\n\nIf the answer is 2, is there a way to force all my photos to sync at full resolution to my iPhone without clicking on each individual photo (which would take about a month of continuous clicking, with no breaks for sleeping)?\n\nA: To downloads all photos, Download and keep originals will retrieve all images from the cloud and save them to your phone.  Optimize storage will only download when photos are viewed and/or are needed by an application.  \nIt may require you to plug your phone in, connect it to Wi-Fi and wait for a bit for all of the photos to download, as you said there are quite a few.  It may help to have Photos open beforehand too.\nSource: Experience & Apple Support documentation. \n\nA: In some cases waiting does not help (there are multiple threads about it on apple forum. )\nWhat worked for me to force downloads was to select as many pictures as I could and choose to share them (for instance via AirDrop). That required iPhone to download originals which I later synced via photos (sharing won't work with live photos)\n\nA: It does work in the background and can take some time. If you turn off icloud for photos and get a message warning you that x number of photos are still not downloded, then you know it’s still downloading them. Cancel and check again later....\n", "Q: How many backups does iCloud save for iPhones? I've noticed that after restoring or erasing an iPhone and setting it up, you're offered backups to restore from iCloud.\nHow many and how old are these backups.

Unfortunately I have been getting kernel panics for a while now. I am not 100% sure but I think it started after I let the battery drain completely one night with the MacBook being in Standby. The next morning it wouldn't turn on and I did not just have to reset the SMC but bypass it. After I started the MacBook that way I could restart normally. This was about two months ago and I think since then I get the kernel panics every now and then.\nMore Information:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Early 2008)\n\n*6Gb RAM\n\n*Mac OS X 10.11.6\n\n*2,4 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT 128MB\n\n\nI also experienced the kernel panics in Safe Mode and during start-up and while I was trying to reinstall macOS. Right now I have the MacBook running while bypassing the SMC and I haven't had a panic yet.\nThe kernel panics appear randomly. I have the feeling that it happens more often when watching videos on youtube, but I can't say for sure. The battery is pretty much wasted and only holds for about 30 minutes. The MacBook usually turns off at 6-10%.\nThen there is another problem, which might be related: When I use the MacBook on battery and with the internal keyboard and trackpad it sometimes hangs for a few seconds in which it first doesn't take any input, and then takes the input but doesn't show it until a short moment later. This has been a problem for a long time now.\nAlso I have recently noticed that I have been using the MacBook with a 60W power supply unit instead of the normal 85W unit. The original one was broken and I just grabbed another one that was laying around, not knowing that Apple MacBooks actually had different power supply units.\nThe Apple Hardware Test doesn't find any problems.\nOne more thing: My login screen shows a weird background. Kind of like the background is made for a screen with a lower resolution. This background is shown on the internal screen and on an external screen.\n\nA look into the kernel panic reports shows that most of the are due to page faults with error code 0 (meaning that a page was requested, that doesn't exist).\nI would put all the reports up, but that might be too much in this question? Here are the two last recent ones.\nSat Apr 22 17:27:51 2017\n\n*** Panic Report ***\npanic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff80021ce6fa): Kernel trap at 0xffffff8002182e33, type 14=page fault, registers:\nCR0:

keyboard and trackpad only. It happens independent on the power source. With less RAM now, it eventuelly freezes and doesn't come back. It still reacts to external devices and the power button works as well.\nThe MacBook doesn't boot with the battery removed. I have done several SMC resets. Without the battery I can only boot by bypassing the SMC.\nI have not had a kernel panic since I removed one RAM module, but of course this could just be, because it just hasn't happened yet.\n\nA: Troubleshooting is a process of elimination so we're going to need to have some patience. :)\nUsually this site is geared to answering one question per question, but you've got a number of issues which may or may not be related, so we'll see how we go.\nBefore proceeding let's ensure your MBP is running isolated from other hardware (no external displays, hard drives, etc).\nKeyboard/trackpad\nLet's start with your keyboard/trackpad issues. I suspect this may be due to your battery, so we need to test for that. Since you can't boot without your battery, I'd try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your Mac as per normal (with the battery inserted and your Mac connected to AC power)\n\n*Now put your Mac to sleep via the Apple menu\n\n*Once it's in sleep mode, close the lid \n\n*Remove the battery \n\n*Open the lid \n\n*Assuming your Mac is still on and you can use it, test your keyboard and trackpad\n\n\nNow, if your keyboard and/or trackpad are fine then you know their issue(s) are related to the battery. If this is the case, it's a simple fix - you need to replace your battery (although you may not want to do that until you know what's causing your other issues).\nKernel panics\nFor now, if you can still use the MBP after Step 6 above, use your Mac (watch videos etc) to see if you can generate a kernel panic.\nLet me know either way how you go.\n", "Q: How to set up Mail so To: auto completes based on Contacts info? When I type \"mom\" into the \"To:\" field, Mail.app doesn't load my mom's email addy:  \n\n...but when I click the blue \"circle/plus\" button and type \"mom\" it does:  \n\nIn Contacts.app I have my Mom's contact info set up so that her \"title\" is \"Mom\".\nHow do I get Mail.app's To: field to auto complete based on her Contacts.app title? Or, is there something I can do in Mail.app so that \"mom\" will autocomplete her email addy from the To: field?  \nmacOS Sierra 10.12.4\n\nA: Title is intended to be used within the scope of a company. If you want Mail to recognize names such as “Mom,” try using the Nickname field instead:  \n\nOn the macOS version of Contacts, you can go into Contacts → Preferences → Template → Add Field and check Nickname. That field will then become available by default when editing any contact, without requiring you to add it through the + menu.\n", "Q: Mono not working I had 2 versions of Mono installed, one via Homebrew, the other downloaded from Mono website (http://www.mono-project.com).\nThis was causing issues with versions, so I tried removing both.\nI uninstalled Homebrew with brew uninstall mono and the other one with \nsudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework\nsudo pkgutil --forget com.xamarin.mono-MDK.pkg\nsudo rm -rf /etc/paths.d/mono-commands\n\n(as per website instructions.)\nI then re-downloaded and installed the latest package from http://www.mono-project.com. It installed successfully, but when I try to mono from Terminal, I get /usr/local/bin/mono: No such file or directory\nI tried brew unlink mono and brew rm mono, but still nothing.\n\nA: Solution from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32542535/how-to-install-mono-on-macos-so-mono-works-in-terminal\nexport PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/:${PATH}\n\n", "Q: How to change file icon based file's extension (.txt, .cpp, .docx, etc) Desired result:\nAll .py files show a nice Python icon, regardless of what default program they opened with. (Same for .cpp files, .txt files, etc)\n_\nHow it currently works:\nFiles (ex: .py files) are associated with their default program (in my case, Sublime text editor). The program (Sublime) then gets to choose what icon to show. It is possible to manually edit the program's (Sublime's) code to change the icons.\nDetails:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/178316/how-to-set-an-icon-for-a-file-type-on-mac\n(I have done this with Sublime)\n_\nWhy this result is not enough:\nI recently switched to the Atom text editor which broke all the icons I had setup in Sublime. In addition, I can't change the icons for Atom like I did in Sublime. The Atom editor's plist file and resources folder is not setup like Sublime. (It is still possible, but rather than renaming/replacing things, Atom actually requires additional code to be written/modified, and I don't have the skill/knowledge to just write the necessary code, and I cannot find any tutorial for learning how)\nI (and I believe many others) would prefer that the file icon was set independently from what the default program is. (I mean an Excel file should look like an Excel file whether or not I open it with Microsoft Excel, Numbers, or Sublime)\n_\nPossible solution:\nIt might be possible to fix this with an opener-app. If an opener-app is made the default opener for all file extensions, it would be able to set the icon for all those extensions. Then when the opener-app opens a file (for example .py file) it could then open that file with another program (for example Sublime). This way the default program could be changed through the opener-app, (for example, changing  the opener-app to have all .py files open the Atom Editor) but, because the opener-app is still technically the default, all the file-icons remain unchanged.\n_\nQuestion:\nDoes anyone know of an app that does this already?\n(If you know of any resources on how to create an app like this, I'd be happy to use them to make the app myself, and post the answer here)\n\nA: (note, this appears not to work as of MacOS Big Sur v11.1 )\nI was able to hack together an app that does this.\nI created a repo explaining it here\nYou can download the app using the download button on this page\nYou can change the icons for existing file types. The only code I had to write for it was the following applescript:\non open this_item\n    tell application \"Visual Studio Code\"\n        open this_item\n    end tell\nend open\n\nSetup For yourself\nOpen script editor (a built-in Mac app)\nChoose File -> Open -> where ever you downloaded the app\nYou will then be viewing the grand total of 5 lines of code I wrote. Change \"Visual Studio Code\" to whatever app you want to be your default.\nSave the file (command + s).\nMove the app to your applications folder.\nFind a file you want to change the icon of (lets say a text file). Click the file once (highlight it), press command + i, go to the open with section. Choose DefaultOpener from the list, then click change all.\nYou will probably have to reboot and toggle the show icon preview button (found in Finder's View Options) a few times for the icons to refresh and get replaced.\nI have a few default icons already loaded up ( Text files, cpp files, bash/shell files, python, and about 7 others), but if you want to add your own:\n\n*\n\n*Open your applications folder\n\n*Right click on DefaultOpener\n\n*Choose show package content\n\n*Then open the content folder\n\n*Then open the resources folder\n\n*Then replace whatever icon with your own icon!\n(Note your replacement icon will need to be a .icns file)\n\n*Restart and toggle the show icon preview button a few times\n\n*List item\n\nEdit: All of the sublime code referenced in an earlier answer has been fully removed from the app\n", "Q: Should I upgrade Mavericks to Yosemite? I have MacBook Pro 5,5 Mid 2009 Core 2 Duo with 4GB of RAM running Mavericks\n and I am wondering if should I upgrade my system to Yosemite.\nDoes Yosemite make my system run faster what about performance and heat?\n\nA: \nDoes Yosemite make my system run faster what about performance and\n  heat?\n\nFaster?  Not that you are going to be significantly notice.  If your apps were slow to begin with, they are going to be just as slow with an OS upgrade.\nPerformance?  Heat?  (I assume you are talking about efficiency here.)  You will probably notice increase stability in your apps. Any performance gains (speed) will be negligible. Again, if your app is slow on Mavericks, it will continue to be slow on Yosemite.\nHeat is a topic that seems to get way more attention than it deserves.  The temperature of your CPU/GPU is dependent on how much work it's doing. If you have no processes running that consume CPU cycles, it won't generate any heat.  Conversely, if you have lots, it will generate lots of heat.  If the CPU gets too hot, it will shut itself down.  In large data centers we concern ourselves with heat, but not to the degree (pun intended, maybe) here.  Worrying about very minute temperature changes of a CPU is academic at best.\nShould you upgrade?\nYes.  Beyond any perceived performance enhancements, you need to get security and bug fixes.  Holding on to an old version of an OS can potentially lock you out of important fixes.  That said, I have personally held off on Sierra because all the perceived benefits it brought are outweighed by the myriad of issues it has (El Cap is still current, so it's not a problem).\nHowever, I wouldn't go to Yosemite;  I would go to El Capitan and be done with it (it's the highest OS supported by your MacBook Pro).  Personally, I have found El Cap to be extremely stable even on older MacBook Pros such as yours.\nAlthough Apple has traditionally killed off the ability to download older versions of macOS unless you \"purchased\" it previously, they have made the El Captain installer available for users with Macs unsupported by Sierra. \nOn a side note, I suggest \"purchasing\" (aka downloading) every macOS version that comes out even if you have no plans on using it immediately.  This will link it to your AppleID and you will have access to it long after it's no longer supported.  You can delete it once the download is complete, but the \"purchase\" record will be there.\nUpgrade your hardware.\nIf you want to see higher performance (and less heat), you should upgrade your RAM to the max of 8GB.1  This will ensure that more of your apps reside in RAM rather than on you hard drive (in swap).  You will also want to upgrade to an SSD which runs significantly cooler and faster than a traditional hard drive.\nThis, more than anything will give you a performance boost.

Does time machine version this file after each change, or is it intelligent enough to see into the library, even though I can't?\n\nA: All Apple iLife and iWork apps are optimized for storage to make Time Machine run well.\nWhen you see a 50 GB library in finder, you can control click and show package contents. The \"library\" is a highly ordered collection of files, so when you are editing clips and effects and assembling a project, only the small changes you make are backed up each time. The large clips don't change as you add them to a project and transform them.\nBe sure you don't move/ trim / edit / delete any files stored inside a package directly. That will usually break the program and require you to retrieve a backup where the database that tracks all the component files matches the files you actually have on disk.\nIf you're interested in the command line - the tmutil compare option is handy. As soon as a backup finishes, you can run that to see the files that change often (there are tons). Then you could open iMovie (and only iMovie) and make a small change - then rerun the tmutil compare to convince yourself that small file changes mean small incremental writes the next time a backup starts.\n", "Q: iPhone automatically deletes every single email on Yahoo server? I have been using the same yahoo mail account for about 9 years and all the emails I received were stored there perfectly. My 2009 Macbook stored every email as well. After setting up my email account on a new iPhone on the Mail app in 2014, the app only displayed emails which I received in the past month or so. My Macbook was still storing every single email.\nI recently (2016) bought a new Macbook, and I noticed that only the emails which I can see on my iPhone are shown in the Mail app on the new Macbook. Checking my mail account via browser, I saw that every mail has been deleted except for the mails on my Phone and new Macbook. All the mails are still in the inbox of my old Macbook.\nIn short: New iPhone deletes emails on the email server permanently so that my new Macbook cannot access them. Old Macbook still stores old emails (even those not on the server) in the inbox and just adds new emails to the old ones.\nMy thoughts so far: I think that it must be something wrong either in the mail preferences on the iPhone or in the yahoo server. I don't know why the old Macbook still syncs with the server and keeps the old mails.\nWhat I have found so far: According to yahoo, they had similar cases in which apps accessing the mail account deleted old emails. And I have read that some Mac-users have experienced the same problem.\nIs there some way to stop the iPhone from deleting emails? Can I maybe re-insert my old mails from my old computer into the server?\n\nEDIT: The account uses IMAP.\n\nA: All the devices were using the same email account. But every device except the old Macbook accessed it with IMAP, the old Macbook used POP. (I realised this very late.) This caused that the old Macbook downloaded all the emails and deleted them from the server, and that's why the other devices couldn't see the emails.\nSOLUTION: Created new IMAP account in Mail, then copying all the emails from the POP account to the IMAP account. The other devices were then automatically able to access all the emails.\n(For someone not knowing anything about IMAP or POP, just google the difference between them.)\n", "Q: iPhone 6s noticeably slower (geekbench) I have got an iPhone 6S on October of 2015.\nSometime in 2016, I downloaded Geekbench 3, to benchmark the device.\nMy baseline results are: (5 runs)\nSingle: ~2500 (2450-2550)\nMulti: ~4400\n\nNow, I feel like my iPhone is becoming slower, so I did the benchmark again. (11 months later)\nMy new results are: (5 runs)\nSingle: ~1500 (1200-1800)\nMulti: ~2100\n\nAnd it seems that it is somewhat dependent on the battery percentage (low battery => low result. but even 100% battery is ~1700)\n\nI understand these are synthetic benchmarks, and are not fully representing the device's performance, but it seems odd, and I want to know if my device is defective? Do I have a case for a phone replacement? Or, am I reading too much into it, and devices just decay over time?\nNote: I'm not sure if this is relevant, but my device is part of the apple recall for battery replacement, but because the apple re-seller in my country does not supply phone replacement, I did not change it.\n\nA: It would appear to be an intentional change in how the phones perform as the battery ages, to prevent early shutdown in exchange for slower performance.\nFrom Geekbench - iPhone Performance and Battery Age\n\nPerformance and Battery Age So what’s going on here?\nFirst, it appears the problem is widespread, and will only get worse\n  as phones (and their batteries) continue to age. \nSecond, the problem is due, in part, to a change in iOS. The\n  difference between 10.2.0 and 10.2.1 is too abrupt to be just a\n  function of battery condition. I believe (as do others) that Apple\n  introduced a change to limit performance when battery condition\n  decreases past a certain point. Why did Apple do this? kadupse on\n  Reddit offers the following explanation:\n\"Many iPhone 6s devices were shutting down unexpectedly, even after\n  the battery replacement program (Which many people weren’t entitled to\n  use). Because degraded batteries last much less and end up with a\n  lower voltage Apple’s solution was to scale down CPU performance, it\n  doesn’t solve anything and is a bad experience… but it’s better than\n  having your device shutdown at 40% when you need it the most.\"\nApple acknowledged the sudden shutdown issue that affected the iPhone\n  6 and iPhone 6s earlier this year. However, does the same issue affect\n  the iPhone 7? Apple appears to have added a similar change to iOS\n  11.2.0 for the iPhone 7.\nIf the performance drop is due to the “sudden shutdown” fix, users\n  will experience reduced performance without notification. Users expect\n  either full performance, or reduced performance with a notification\n  that their phone is in low-power mode. This fix creates a third,\n  unexpected state. While this state is created to mask a deficiency in\n  battery power, users may believe that the slow down is due to CPU\n  performance, instead of battery performance, which is triggering an\n  Apple introduced CPU slow-down. This fix will also cause users to\n  think, “my phone is slow so I should replace it” not, “my phone is\n  slow so I should replace its battery”. This will likely feed into the\n  “planned obsolecense” narritive.\n\n\nA: Your answer is on this post on the geekbench blog.

But I have a good mouse: Microsoft sculpt touch mouse. It lost too, I have to pick a wired mouse or restart the Macbook.\nThis mouse already has the random lost of connection when Macbook is awake but it always reconnect (I am aware this is a common problem with bluetooth mouses, at list with El Capitan). As the PAN connection, bluetooth is lost almost every time I close the Macbook or after sleeping. Sometimes, the mouse come back after a while (minutes later) - mysterious! \nI have researched around the web about, there was a solution for Yosemite by command line to restart the service, but won't work on Capitan. I could kill the Bluetooth but could not restart it.\nYosemite solution in githubgist\nI found a complex solution that needs home-brew and blue tools installation, will monitor the wake up and restart the bluetooth service automatically (If I understood right).

One thing was working: move the mouse to wake it BEFORE opening the Macbook. Always worked. I did reset all Bluetooth and delete the .plist file - observing the behavior...\n\nA: I have come across many cases of various Microsoft Bluetooth mouse users having issues, so as a minimum some of their Bluetooth mouse products appear to be very fussy. \nHowever, one thing I have seen that does work in some cases is to make sure it's the first Bluetooth device paired to your computer. \nIn a nutshell you need to reset both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller. However, this will reset all connected Bluetooth devices, including a keyboard and mouse.\nIn other words, this will remove all existing pairing information for Bluetooth devices, so each will need to be reconnected.\nI have some steps you can follow, but I strongly suggest you read all of the steps first before commencing (or perhaps print out the instructions / view them on another device).\nBefore starting, ensure you have the Bluetooth icon showing in the menu bar. If it is not there, open System Preferences > Bluetooth and enable the option Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar.\nAlso, since you're trying to resolve an issue with a Bluetooth mouse,  you will need to use another mouse to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. Once the menu is showing, release the keys.    \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu, choose Debug > Remove All Devices\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys again and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu,  choose Debug > Reset the Bluetooth Module\n\n*Shutdown your Mac\n\n*Ensure your Microsoft sculpt touch mouse is fully powered off\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*On your Mac, click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar (obviously with a USB mouse)\n\n*Select the Set Up Bluetooth Device option\n\n*On the mouse, press the power button down and keep it down for at least 5 secs. From memory a blue light should start blinking\n\n*Once the Setup Assistant finds the mouse, select it from the list and click on “Continue”. \n\n*Now pair your mouse\n\n*If you have any other Bluetooth devices, you can go ahead and pair them now (or you can do it later). However, the point is to pair the Microsoft sculpt touch mouse first before any other Bluetooth devices!\nLet me know how you go.\n\nA: Why bother reseting bluetooth via the debug menu if restarting the macbook pro.

So, to rephrase your question, Can you remove the drive from the dead MacBook and connect it to the functioning Mac to transfer the data?\nThe answer is yes.  You will need to basically do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the SSD\n\n*Install it into a USB enclosure\n(You didn't specify which MacBook Air you have and it is very important as the drives are very different).\nRemoving the SSD\nThe procedure for removing the SSD for all MBAs is essentially the same - you remove the back cover, remove the retaining screws of the SSD and disconnect the SSD module.  \n\n\nIfixt.com has excellent instructions and this procedure is rated as \"moderate\" (no idea why, it's super easy) and only 5-10 mins to complete.\nInstall in USB Enclosure\nNext, you install it into the USB enclosure - just plug it in - it only goes in one way.

I'd hate to have to service it. \n\nA: More than likely, the Reed switch1 that detects when the lid is open/closed is momentarily making contact and sending your MacBook into sleep/hibernation mode. It could be faulty. \nThis YouTube video shows a MBP going to sleep when a magnet is applied to the area where the switch is located.\nIt's happening on the train because there is enough movement or bumps in the ride to cause the switch to close.  Closing and opening the lid \"resets\" the switch which then sends the signal to wake up.  Normally, these switches are pretty robust and movement like that of a vehicle isn't enough to to trip them, but I have seen defective ones that would fail by simply turning the machine upside down (Dell, not Apple).  That said, in over 25 years in IT, I can count the number of times on one hand I have seen this type of symptom.\nIf you still have Apple Care, take a video of the MacBook going to sleep on the train and how you wake it back up.  Take the video and the MacBook to Apple and have them fix the issue for you.\n\n1 Wikipedia:  Reed switch The Reed switch is an electrical switch operated by an applied magnetic field\n", "Q: My photos disappeared after reprogramming my iPhone 4 I have a huge problem. My iPhone 4 went off and went to a service to fix it. I said to him that I have too many photos there and he should be careful. He said he reprogrammed my iPhone, and when I turned on the phone all my photos and apps were deleted. I had my entire life there, is there any way to get at least my photos back. \nTo be clear, I have never done any back up with iCloud or iTunes.\n\nA: Since you don't have a backup, you will want to put the phone in airplane mode and stop using the device. Then see what companies do data recovery from iPhones. \nIt is trickier than recovering data from a hard drive since SSD/flash storage allocates things differently than a sector based disk does. Also, the passcode and pairing procedure make mounting the raw storage harder. \nYou should expect to pay some $$ for the service. The specific model of iOS and hardware will increase or decrease the cost as will your location in the world and if you need quick service vs sending it off to a lower cost location for the recovery work. \n", "Q: Why Homebrew is connecting to Google analytics and how to disable it? I've noticed that when I run :\nbrew update\n\nHomebrew is connecting to Google analytics. Why? And how to disable it?\n\nA: According to the official documentation : Anonymous Aggregate User Behaviour Analytics\n\nHomebrew has begun gathering anonymous aggregate user behaviour analytics and reporting these to Google Analytics. You will be notified the first time you run brew update or install Homebrew.\n  Why?\nHomebrew is provided free of charge and run entirely by volunteers in their spare time. As a result, we do not have the resources to do detailed user studies of Homebrew users to decide on how best to design future features and prioritise current work. Anonymous aggregate user analytics allow us to prioritise fixes and features based on how, where and when people use Homebrew.\n\nYou can disable this feature with :\nbrew analytics off\n\nor by setting\nexport HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS=1\n\n\nA: The anonymizing flag is hardcoded as enabled, the Google Analytics anonymous IP setting, with further remarks:\n\nIt is impossible for the Homebrew developers to match any particular\nevent to any particular user, even if we had access to the Homebrew\nanalytics user ID (which we do not).\nAs far as we can tell it would be impossible for Google to match the\nrandomly generated Homebrew-only analytics user ID to any other Google\nAnalytics user ID. If Google turned evil the only thing they could do\nwould be to lie about anonymising IP addresses and attempt to match\nusers based on IP addresses.\n\nBut the only solution is to use a firewall. It's been normalized for most apps to track everything from heat maps to the people at Google trying to the your formulae collection fingerprint to your next online purchase.\n\n", "Q: Correct way to provision multiple laptops? I work as a Linux system administrator but I also wear many hats. One of those hats is Apple laptop provisioning and maintenance.\nIn my naiveté with the Apple Way of doing things, I've been using the same Apple ID to provision new laptops. This has caused some problems, such as users not being able to perform software updates on their own laptop.\nUsing a separate apple ID for each laptop is untenable: it doesn't scale, isn't manageable, and is tied to users (i.e. owned by people), not to a central, shared management resource. Which is why using the same Apple ID made sense to me.\nWhat is the recommended way to provision and update multiple laptops?\nEDIT: I realized that this question doesn't quite address my real concern, which is the initial provisioning of Macbooks.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the Apple Volume Purchase Program help with intial \"imaging\" of\nlaptops?\n\n*How is imaging and initialization of laptops handled in\nthe Apple world? Does Apple have tools for this or third parties are\nbetter?\n\n*How do people handle the installation of required\nsoftware and then hand that off to end users? I want my end users to perform their own updates. Does\nVPP do this? (Example: I build a laptop with software XYZ on it, but I\ndon't have access to the end user's Apple ID to install it, so I\ninstall it with my corporate Apple ID. How does the end user then\nupdate package XYZ?)\nI am primarily a Linux sysadmin, so this whole notion of having software maintained by an actual person vs maintained by a system user seems bonkers to me. So that's where my disconnect is.\nLinux example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Root installs package XYZ via Apt or Yum. The packages come from a package repository which is similar in many respects to Apple Store.\n\n*Root is a system user\n\n*Root access is granted to a real user. But there's no direct tie between the actual user, the system, and the package repository. i.e. Any user with root access can install and upgrade any package on the system. You never get these Apple messages that the wrong Apple ID was used to install software XYZ and you can't upgrade it.\n\nA: The Apple suggested solution is to use volume purchase and let your users manage their AppleID and you manage the licenses. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/business/vpp/\nThere is a program for business and another for education.

At work I have an older Dell display and at home I have a new LG UltraFine 5K Display (I picked it up from Apple mid January 2017).  When I travel I turn the power to my laptop off (I don't travel with it hibernated)\nIf I go to work in the morning and hook it into my work monitor (USB-C to thunderbolt2 plugged into a Belkin Thunderbolt dock connected to the Dell monitor via HDMI) everything works fine.\nWhen I come home and connect my laptop to my LG monitor using the single USB-C cable that came with the monitor.  Every time I start the laptop up in this configuration the LG monitor's brightness is set to the lowest possible setting.

For additional security, my Mac is requesting that I enter my iPhone passcode. My iPhone passcode contains non-English letters and other special characters. On my iPhone entering this passcode is done by accessing other keyboards or holding down a key for additional letters.\nHowever, when entering the passcode on my Mac, I have no option for additional keyboards. And holding down a key does not provide additional letters, it just repeats the same letter. Also, I am hindered by being unable to see the passcode (only asterisks) so entering a character mapping code would be difficult, if that is even possible. The only option I see is to select \"forgot your passcode?\" even though I know my passcode. Is changing my passcode to a more limited character set, my only option?\n\n\nA: On the Mac - open System Preferences.\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard\n\n\nYou can use the Input Sources section to add Unicode Hex Input and enter any of the 120,000 characters in that standard by value.

It is a Gmail account, and it doesn't appear on my google calendar. \nFor some reason, it's not letting delete from my iCal.\n\nA: Calendars that are part of your Google account cannot in general be deleted from within Calendar.app. To delete the calendar, go to https://calendar.google.com/ (or in your case possibly https://www.focuster.com/ ) and manipulate your calendar subscriptons there. \nDifferent pieces of software interact with Google calendars using a variety of protocols - Exchanage ActiveSync, CalDAV, http, and maybe others. Some of these protocols do not support all the calendars visible in your Google account, or need to be configured to show calendars beyond those listed as \"My Calendars\" in the Google web interface.\nInformation about using Apple's Calendar.app in macOS or iOS with Google Calendars is here:\nhttps://support.google.com/calendar/answer/99358\nUsing the controls at https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect you can select the calendars that are visible to Calendar.app - this would allow you to turn off the syncing of calendars you do not want to see (like the \"Focuster\" one mentioned) without needing to delete them entirely from your Google Calendar account. \nIt is possible that a system like Focuster will recreate their calender if deleted or turn it back on for syncing if it is turned off, so you may have to manipulate it through their system rather than just using the Google controls.\n\nA: Because Focuster automatically schedules your to-do list in your calendar it assumes that the calendar might have been deleted in error and will re-create it.\nYou'll want to login at https://focuster.com and contact the support team if you want to remove your account and delete the calendar.\n", "Q: rsync cron job for backup not working I'm trying to run a backup from one HDD to another at 10pm everynight on a Mac Pro.

Keep in mind that macOS usually mounts external drives as noowners (set to ignore permission). You should consider enabling permissions on any external drive with the proper access for that user.\nThen set the preference file-/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/autodiskmount :\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/autodiskmount AutomountDisksWithoutUserLogin -bool true\n\nNote: I didn't test whether this preference file works in Sierra.\n", "Q: Can Siri be used effectively by someone who stutters when they speak? I am curious if Siri can be used effectively by those who stutter when they speak. By effectively, I mean that the error rate where it misunderstands what you are intending to say is low enough that it can be used without undue frustration in day to day life.\nI would ideally like to hear from someone who has firsthand experience with this. \n\nA: It’s hard to answer definitively, because it greatly varies depending on the degree to which the person stutters.\nI have a stutter, though it’s fairly mild these days thanks to a few decades of working to correct it. I do make a conscious effort to form my thoughts completely before speaking to Siri, and I’ll still stutter on occasion. Sometimes the result is workable, because Siri doesn’t need to recognize exact sentences, but instead relies on general meaning and keywords; other times I just have to start over.\nIt happens infrequently enough that it doesn’t bother me. Now if you stutter a lot it might become frustrating, but that depends on your patience level, and once again on the extent to which you stutter. And even someone who stutters “a lot” may do so in a way that is easy for a machine to correct, if that makes any sense.\nAs an aside, I think most people have to form complete thoughts in their heads before speaking to an AI. The state of the technology doesn’t enable it to deal with what would be considered “normal” speech patterns anyway, with all its hesitations, self-corrections, etc.\nFrom my limited knowledge of speech impediments, different people struggle with different phonemes, certain sounds in specific arrangements, etc. Myself, I struggle greatly with the “W” sound at the start of a sentence (among other things). This is highly workable with Siri, because if I can get past the very first letter of a question, then I’m usually good to go \nFor the most part, interactions with Siri are fairly short. “What time is it?” “Shuffle my Favorites playlist.” “Give me directions to Starbucks.” I’d say if you have reliable mechanisms/tricks for working around your hurdles in short bursts, you’ll find Siri pretty usable.\nSorry for all the “It depends,” but hopefully this helps at least a little. There is solace in that Apple has been focusing on Siri’s error rate, and accessibility is an area of importance to Apple.\nAnd quite frankly, even native speakers with no speech impediment complain about Siri’s error rate all the time  I’m just trying to say there is going to be a baseline amount of frustration with the technology no matter what.\nI would recommend relaying your experience with Siri to Apple. Also Tim Cook appears to read all emails he receives, though he may not always respond. He cares deeply about users with accessibility needs, as he has made evident on numerous occasions. I’m not going to post his email address here, but it’s easy to search for.\n", "Q: Will Game Data be Erased from iOS Restore if Connected to Game Center? After forgetting my passcode for my iPad, I have decided that I need to restore my iPad through recovery mode (which I am aware that it will completely erase everything else). However, will that erase my Apple ID and Game Center data? In other words, if I restore and wipe my iPad clean, then enter again and download my game and sign in to Game Center, will all that game progress still be saved somewhere online or something via Game Center or Apple ID, or is all that information only stored in the iPad itself and not online/in a cloud/etc and will be lost? \n\nA: I have done this before and no, it does not erase your Apple ID or Game Center data. However, not all applications and games use Game Center or iCloud to store data so keep that in mind.\n", "Q: Install Adobe Reader DC without uninstalling Adobe Reader? How can I install the Adobe Reader DC without uninstalling the old Adobe Reader (11)?\nI want to manage the installation of Adobe Reader DC on my clients without deleting their old Adobe Reader.\nIs there a official download site from Adobe or could I edit the .pkg package?\nI got a free Adobe Enterprise License also but I can only find the installer at Adobe which installs the DC but uninstalls the old Reader.\n\nA: Are you talking about Acrobat (Pro) or Adobe/Acrobat Reader?\nIn the second case, you would not get the \"official\" download file from Adobe (because that is just a (IMHO extremely crappy) install manager. Instead you would get the actual Reader installer from the enterprise page of the Adobe website\nAs you are on Mac, multiple versions can be installed in parallel, and even do run concurrently.

Onyx is quite a capable utility and it's free - if you like it, donate a bit for the Author though he does a great job with this app.\nYou can do this by launching Onyx, entering your admin password and choosing the login tab:\n\nThere are also tons of other options you can check out. Tinkering with Onyx is quite secure since you can roll back to defaults with one button press, so don't worry about bricking something - but still be aware what you click ;)\nIf you want to do this without any extra software, you would need to edit your defaults by importing/exporting them. I wrote a script for the exporting part, it writes each domain into a separate file for easier overview and keeps system namespace/user namespace separate + sorts out system/apple defaults from those that were changed/set by any software the user installed.\nI use it mostly for filtering crap leftovers from tests to keep the defaults tidy- since the background/login is also set there- that's what you need to edit.\nIn some cases, you might need to parse binary .plist files, and this needs an editor that can parse those- easily done with TextMate (or Xcode if in need of \"vanilla\").

It is supposedly used to sync passwords for Internet Accounts to multiple devices, but it exists and causes trouble even if you don't use iCloud (I don't).\nThe solution is relatively easy, but very annoying:  First stop all apps, then entirely remove (or move to the Trash in case you're afraid you might want to have the option to restore it) the sub-directory (or directories) called ~/Library/Keychains/U-U-I-D/ (where U-U-I-D is a long hexadecimal UUID), and then immediately reboot.  I also removed the old mail account password items from the login keychain, but this may not be necessary.  Either way you may have to re-enter passwords for various accounts, but this time they should appear in both your normal login keychain and the magic Local Items keychain.\nAfter rebooting you should see that directory re-created, and in Keychain Access you should see the Local Items keychain unlocked when the login keychain is unlocked -- if not then lock and unlock the login keychain.\nAlso make sure you have disabled (un-checked) all of the 'automatically manage connection settings' boxes for both incoming and outgoing servers in all Mail accounts (found in Mail Preferences under Accounts/ServerSettings).\n", "Q: Permanently prune backups created by Time Machine I am cleaning up old Time Machine backups, which slows stuff down to a grind.

Since an application wasn't closed (that's Oracle VM VirtualBox, if it helps; an instance of VM was operating) the previous night, I saw a dialog asking whether I would continue to log out (probably in order to let me deal with the unsaved VM state). Also, I saw a file called \"logout\", 0KB in size, resided in the Downloads folder, which was created in the midnight.\nPlease help me figure out why this happens. It feels really strange.

Is this possible? My MacBook is connected to monitor via computer's USB-C to monitor's Display Port with one cable. Given that MacBook only has one USB-C port, my computer cannot charge while using the monitor. If the computer is not charging the display will shut off when the MacBook's lid is closed thus requiring me to leave the lid open, which is, in turn, draining power quickly. \nIs there a way to power the computer via the monitor while plugged in?\n\nA: This isn't a USB-C compliant monitor so it's not going to supply power.1  DVI, DP, and HDMI don't support power delivery.  Looking at the Tech Specs page for this monitor, it supports:\n\n\n*\n\n*DVI\n\n*HDMI\n\n*VGA\n\n\nTo charge your MacBook and connect your external monitor, you need something like the Apple USB-C Multiport AV adapter.\n\nSo, you won't be able to charge your MacBook via this monitor because your monitor doesn't support power delivery, but you can have both your monitor and power adapter connected by using this adapter.\n\n1 USB-C Power Delivery Specification.  http://www.usb.org/developers/powerdelivery/\n", "Q: Siri is unable to hear me I’m unable to use Siri on my MacBook Pro with macOS Siera 10.12.4.

Any app to do that? So I have a long conversation on my iPhone in the iMessages app. It is a long text message conversation with a friend. Now I want a copy of the whole conversation so I can send to another friend.\nRight now I do: take a screen shot of every block of the conversation and send to my friend ⇒ 20 screenshots. Not practical for me and my recipient.\nI know you can have iMessages in your MAC by using your Apple ID but I don't want to use my Apple ID with iMessages. I want to continue to use my phone number.

When you click on a link containing to a CSV file, Safari renders it by default.  Most other browsers will download them in this circumstance and I'd like to make Safari do the same.  \nWhat's the setting to make that happen?\n\nA: Let Safari open the CSV, then press Command/Control + S to save it.\n\nA: I have the same issue and have done some web searching and have not found a good answer.  This does work consistently for me in Chrome so when I need to export a CSV, I just do it in Chrome.  I have been able to cut/paste the Safari text into TextEdit, switch it to \"text only\" formatting and then save the file as a CSV, but this is so clicky -- if I'm going to do it more than once or twice, I just switch to Chrome for that browser session.\n", "Q: How do I restore my notes on macOS Sierra?

However, when I open iTunes on my laptop I see 2.29 GB of unused storage space showing on the usage bar at the bottom of my screen. Which is correct?\n\nA: iTunes does not see content downloaded for offline listening on iPhone. For example, content downloaded from Spotify will not appear to take up iTunes storage but will take up iPhone storage and iCloud storage if you are using iCloud to back up content and access content across multiple devices. \n", "Q: How can I listen to just part of a single song, or just skip some time? Sometimes I just want to listen to part of a song. \nIn Youtube I can set start/end times for a particular video.  I'm listening to this song and only want to start at 2:50, and end somewhere else. \nThis example is a 6 minute song... but I'm sure there are other refrains/etc in pop music that could want this.\n\nA: If you have access to a Mac, you can right-click the song, then go into Get Info → Options, where you can then set both Start and Stop times.\nThese preferences will propagate to your iOS devices next time you synchronize them to your iTunes Music Library. If you subscribe to iTunes in the Cloud (via iTunes Match or MUSIC), that will be done over the air.\nThis is a persistent modification that will apply every time you listen to that song (until you reset the Start and Stop times).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Touch Bar control strip gone The control strip of my touch bar is not working anymore.

This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \n\nA: The issue with the TouchBar issue is related to a grounding problem between the motherboard an the standoffs underneath it, what happens is that it grounds out from time to time depending on where you press on the back casing of the MacBook Pro 13 2016 (this is my personal issue with it). I did a Top Case replacement (everything except, logic board, TouchID, and screen) and the issue remained. \nI now have to come up with another solution to figure it out but my guess or solution is to put thin round rubber dampers over the logic board screw holes then put the logic board back over them (same ones used on the strip covering the battery ribbon), poke a hole into into them an put the screws back in. This lifts the logic board slightly an keeps a shortage from occurring.\n\nA: In terminal type:\nsudo pkill TouchBarServer\n\nThis terminates the ill-fated touch bar process, at which point your OS will restart a fresh, uncorrupted copy, restoring your crashed touch bar.\nIn my case the soft keys were still responding but were not lit, so I couldn't see what I was pressing. I had this happen after several weeks of not restarting my MacBook Pro. None of the non-invasive solutions above worked and I didn't want to restart my MBP.\nIf that doesn't work for you, you can also try opening the Activity Monitor and stopping TouchBarServer\n\nA: Go To System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Tick \"Show Control Strip\" Box -> Change Touch Bar Shows To Extended Control Strip or anything else that you like\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and the only thing that worked was a factory reset.\nI hope that works for you too :)\n\nA: I would make one backup of files and apps and settings you need or let Time Machine get a backup. Then boot to internet recovery and reinstall the same OS you have. \nThat runs through the needed EFI, recovery and bridge OS updates and likely will ensure the drivers you need are loaded. \nYou can revive or restore your Mac as well if you want to control that explicitly. Make sure you have a complete backup, since you may erase everything based on which path you choose.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-2/revive-or-restore-mac-firmware-apdebea5be51/mac\n\nA: A force restart (press and hold power button until the computer shuts down) did solve the problem for me.\n", "Q: How can I record synthesizer music to iPad? I have an iPad Air 2 and I just bought Loopy HD.\nI also have a Roland synthesizer with MIDI output. Is there a MIDI to lightning cable?\nI want to play something on my synth and add it to Loopy.\nThanks!\n\nA: As long as the synth you have is core MIDI compatible. You may use a Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit or the Apple USB 3 Camera Connection Kit if it requires a bit of power output.\nOther alternatives to just straight up USB for non-core MIDI products (products that require drivers) include iRig accessories, or plugKEY. \nYou will need this cable to make it work.\nBest of Luck!\n", "Q: Did my Time Machine backup copy over properly? I have an old WD hard drive that I used for Time Machine for a while, but the drive is showing signs of age (it starts buzzing loudly if left on for a while), so I bought a new (Toshiba) drive to replace it. I had on the WD hard drive a Time Machine backup for someone else's computer also that I didn't really need anymore. The total size between the two backups was about 300 GB (100 for theirs, 200 GB for my computer). Anyway in the morning I dragged the backups folder with both backups from the WD to the Toshiba. Took like 5 hours for it to finish \"preparing to copy\", and by the time I wanted to go to bed it still had like 70 GB left to copy. I didn't want to leave it running so I hit cancel, figuring that the next day I could delete the other computer's backup and try again. So today I was going to do that, and I saw it actually had already copied my computer's backup to the Toshiba HDD and part of the other computer's Time Machine backup. It seemed like it did the folder for my computer first and then moved on to the backup of the other computer. But when I compared the folder for my computer's backup between the new and old hard drives, the old folder showed about 300 MB larger than the new one. It's pretty close but it makes me wonder.\nSo I set the new HDD as the Time Machine drive, Time Machine seems to work normally, it even did a backup to the new drive like normal. Does it sound like it copied properly? Can size variations like that between large directories of copied folders happen, maybe there are certain unnecessary things that don't copy, or size is read differently? I would very much like to avoid wiping the backup off the new hard drive and re-copying everything.\nSecondarily, if it's possible that some files in the backup didn't transfer, would the fact that it did a new backup onto that drive fill in any gaps or missing files if I needed to, say, restore from a time machine backup?\n\nA: Time Machine does not make a 100% perfect copy, nor does it necessarily make a BOOTABLE copy should you need to swap it in suddenly one day.  A better way to upgrade to a new SSD (don't spend all that time only to put in another slow spinning drive that only lasts 2-3 years these days!), is to also purchase a usb-to-sata transfer cable for $10-$20, use Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) on the old mac to make a bootable mirror image, including the hidden recovery partition (and possibly update it!), then swap drives and go about your life.  Optionally wipe the old drive to use for testing or backups if it's still safe to use at all.. likely not if it's several years old.  CCC is a fantastic paid backup app, but I think you can get away with making a full bootable clone without buying it first.  This may have changed.\n", "Q: Blue bar for \"Google Maps is Using Your Location\" missing Typically, if Google Maps is closed while in use, there will be a blue bar indicating that Google Maps is still in use. Recently this bar has stopped appearing for me.\nWhy might the location bar have stopped showing up?\n\n\nA: iOS 11\nAccording to Techcrunch, iOS 11 will show the blue location bar when an app is using your location regardless of your privacy settings.\n\nIn iOS 10, if an app was set to use location “Only While Using the App”, and you pressed the Home button, a blue bar would appear. In iOS 11, the blue bar functionality has been expanded to those apps that are set to “Always,” too.\nThat means the blue status bar displays when those apps are using the continuous background location service – sort of like how the green bar shows up when a phone call is active, but you’ve exited from the Phone app to go to your home screen.\n\n\niOS 10\nCheck Settings → Privacy → Location Services → Google Maps and make sure location access for Google Maps is set to \"While using the app\". The blue bar won't show up if it's set to \"Always\".\n\n", "Q: AppleScript: How to check if the clipboard consists of a file (instead of text)? If my understanding is correct, there are two types of content that can be copied to the Mac global (systemwide) clipboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*text\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*file\nEven though they are two different, discrete data types, they share the very same clipboard. For example, if you have an image file on your clipboard, and then you copy a text sentence, the sentence will overwrite the image file, and vice versa. Please correct me if I am wrong.\nMy question is, how can I determine if the clipboard does not contain text, using AppleScript?\nThe context of my question is an AppleScript .scpt file that speaks the selected text in the System Voice at a specified volume. The selected text is copied to the clipboard, and then the text is spoken via the say command. The script is triggered by keystroke via FastScripts.app.\nEvery so often, I am given an error dialog that states, \"Error Number: -1728.\" This error occurs when, instead of text being highlighted, I have highlighted or selected an actual file. Mac's Speech function cannot speak a file; Speech can only verbalize text.\nSo, I would like to create an if...then statement in my script to catch this error. Ideally, I would then like to convert the file to text, if possible in the way that TextEdit does.\n\nA: If the Clipboard contains a file object, then clipboard info will contain, e.g., «class furl» (a file URL), along with many other classes.\nThe follow example code will check for the presence of «class furl» in the clipboard info:\nif ((clipboard info) as string) contains \"«class furl»\" then\n    say \"the clipboard contains a file named \" & (the clipboard as string)\nelse\n    say \"the clipboard does not contain a file\"\nend if\n\n\nUpdate:\nAs I mentioned in one of my comments, there are other ways to code this, and this approach will return either an empty list or a list containing one list, which should be faster instead of the 14 that the first example returns if it contains a file. If the Clipboard does not contain a file, then the list returned is empty and it errors out, setting cbFile to false, and if not empty, setting it to true, which then is tested against in the following example.\ntry\n    (item 1 of (clipboard info for «class furl»))\n    set cbFile to true\non error\n    set cbFile to false\nend try\nif cbFile then\n    say \"the clipboard contains a file named \" & (the clipboard as string)\nelse\n    say \"the clipboard does not contain a file\"\nend if\n\nBy the way, I ran the purge command in Terminal in between testing these two examples and it felt like the second example is a bit faster, however YMMV.\n", "Q: Waking Mac over WiFi by Linux Does anyone know if a mac can be woken up from the sleep state by a Linux machine over WiFi? The router is non-Apple.\n\nA: Under System Preferences -> Energy Saver, select the checkbox \"Wake for network access\". Note that for Mac laptops this can only be enabled while the laptop is connected to a power source.\n\nAccessing the Mac over the network from your Linux machine, such as through SSH, will wake the machine.\n", "Q: Mac says password is wrong but it's right. I have to enter it twice to start Mac every time. How could I solve it? Mac says password is wrong, but is right, and wants me to enter it again to start Mac every time. My password is used to be characters and numbers. I changed my password into all numbers but it doesn't work.\nHow could I solve it?\nThanks.\n\nA: If you are talking about the user password and you are locked out of your mac, you can try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into the Recovery Drive by choosing the ‘Apple‘ menu > Restart, hold down the ‘command’ + ‘r’ keys on the keyboard during the start up process, when you see the start up screen you can let go. When the machine boots eventually you will see the macOS or OS X Utilities screen.\n\n*Go to the Utilites menu and select Terminal\n\n*At the prompt type ‘resetpassword’ (hit enter)\n\n*Reset your password\n\n\nKeep in mind that this deletes your keychain, so your saved passwords are lost\n\nA: I have the same issue. I found out when I watch what's happening carefully, as I type my password the first time the Mac resets and clears the text area (shortens the line of asterisks) and I have to enter it again - making sure it's not a partial entry. Seems something is still waking up in the background. Type slowly and observe if the line of '***' becomes suddenly shorter. Frustrating.\nOther causes have to do with unlocking FileVault if you have that set up. Found on discussions.apple.com.\n\nA: I have noticed that you need to wait for the \"Enter Password\" text to appear in the input box.  If you begin typing sooner, those characters won't be captured.\n", "Q: Command in $PATH not found I've created a symlink using:\nsudo ln -s ~/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert /usr/local/bin\n\nI can see the command ebook-convert in /usr/local/bin.\nThen I've added /usr/local/bin in my $PATH.

Now could I install the OSX system into this hard drive and boot from it every time? And whether the reading and writing is fast enough?\nThank you.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. For full details refer to How to set up and use an external Mac startup disk. If you have any problems, feel free to come back here and search for an answer (or ask another question if you can't find a solution).\nIn terms of your Samsung MZ-750250B, if you actually meant a Samsung MZ-750250GB then this is actually a SSD and supports a sequential read speed of up to 540 MB/s and a sequential write speed of up to 520 MB/s.

I lookup key in a first column and insert a value from the second one. I've encountered an issue when a wrong key is looked up. Here is a simple example:\n\nThe RBYourselfNotUsedRule is not present in Table 1 and 271 belongs to RBVariableReferencedOnceRule. Does anybody have an idea why RBVariableReferencedOnceRule was looked up for RBYourselfNotUsedRule?\n\nA: If the LOOKUP function can't find the search-for value, the function matches the largest value in search-where that is less than or equal to search-for.  This is why, when the formula cannot find the match, it returns the closest thing it can find.  \nFrom Apple's Documentation:\n\nLOOKUP(search-for, search-where, result-values) search-for: The value\n  to find. search-value can contain any value.\nsearch-where: The collection containing the values to be searched.\n  search-where can contain any values.\nresult-values: An optional collection containing the value to be\n  returned based on the search. result-values can contain any values.\nNotes\n  VLOOKUP compares a search value to the values in the leftmost\n  column of a specified collection. Unless an exact match is required,\n  the row containing the largest left-column value that is less than or\n  equal to the search value is selected. Then, the value from the\n  specified column in that row is returned by the function. If an exact\n  match is required and none of the leftmost-column values match the\n  search value, the function returns an error.\n\nWhen opting for the exact match, you could wrap the formula in a IFERROR() function to catch the \"no match\" error and return whatever you specify.  i.e.: \"\" empty string or other message. \"No Match\" as a example.\nYou may need to use the more powerful function VLOOKUP().\nExample:\n\nA more powerful combination of functions to perform lookups is INDEX(MATCH()). [This function gives much more power for looking up references without having to know the exact column number.]  For more information and an example, see Using INDEX MATCH for Advanced Lookups | Deskbright.  Even though this reference is for Excel, Numbers supports these functions just as well.\n", "Q: Backtick as a non-dead key?

As far as I can see, the major cloud-based backup services that exist for Macs - for example iCloud, Backblaze, or iDrive - back up only your work files. \nThat's great, but it doesn't achieve the comfort of Time Machine which backs up the entire system state, allowing you to restore your backup to a different Mac and continuing with your work without having to first set up your work environment, like with those services that only save your files.\nIs there a product that does this, either as a cloud-based service or a tool that allows you to upload state to your own online space (Web, Amazon S3...) via FTP or similar?\nAlternatively, is there a sane way to do this using Time Machine, say by hosting a TM volume on a virtual private server?\n\nA: Dolly Drive comes to mind. My understanding is they offer exactly what you want, although you'll have to double check if they do it in a manner that suits you. They do offer a fee trial, but this is limited to 100GB - so it probably won't allow you to test it properly for your purposes.\nSince you mentioned using a virtual private server, you could do this without the need of purchasing any extra software. You will, however, need access to a VPN you can use (usually at a monthly or yearly cost). This option also requires that you understand how to use SSH (to run commands, and to edit files). If this is something you're comfortable with, you can check out Configuring Time Machine to back up to your own server over the internet\nAnother possible option is to just use rsync to regularly copy your data to a cloud service. Rsync is a Unix tool to synchronise data between disks or servers, and it supports incremental updates. This option, of course, requires you to be willing/comfortable to use Terminal. As a starting point you can launch Terminal and enter the man rsync command for details.\nI'm sure others here will have suggestions for you.\nMy personal view\nYou can choose to ignore this little blurb, otherwise read on. :)\nMy preference is not to use the cloud for this type of backup. The cloud is great for low volume data storage and file services (e.g. Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, MS OneDrive, etc), but for this type of backup it's not (at least not yet). And, in terms of the OS you can always restore macOS directly via Apple online.\nMy recommendation to users is to always alternate two TM backup drives and store one of them offsite. By way of example, I'll explain how I do this for one of my Macs (but I follow a similar process for all my machines!)\n\n\n*\n\n*This iMac has a 500GB HDD\n\n*I have purchased two portable USB 2TB external hard drives\n\n*I have labelled these hard drives as iMac TM Backup HD 1 and iMac TM Backup HD 2\n\n*I set both of these external drives to be TM backup drives\n\n*As both drives are set up with TM they are alternated whenever both drives are available\n\n*Once the initial backups are done, I physically remove one of the external drives and take it 'offsite'\n\n*On the same day each week, I then swap them over\n\n*The net result is that both hard drives will have backups in the order of one week on, one week off (but between them I have a full set of backups).\n\n\nNow, in terms of keeping one of them offsite, you have a number of options. Over the years I have used as my offsite location any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*My workplace\n\n*A shed in the back yard\n\n*My car (but this may depend on your climate and where you 'garage' your car)\n\n*A family member's/friend's place (assuming you trust them!)\n\n\nBasically, the idea is that your offsite drive is somewhere that protects your data in the event your house burns down or you get robbed. My strong suggestion would be in a locked drawer at your workplace (unless you work at home). Most people's workplaces are air-conditioned, secure, and convenient.\nRegardless of the 'offsite' location you choose to keep your hard drive, there are some key factors to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always keep the drive safe from large magnetic fields!\n\n*Ensure the location has a temperature range between 10 degrees celsius (50 degrees fahrenheit) and 43 degrees celsius (110 degrees fahrenheit). So, keeping it in a car would usually not be a good idea.\n\n", "Q: This content can't be played on this Apple TV Just watched Suits - S6; E13. I bought the season pass a while ago.

He sent me the developerID_installer.cer file via e-mail and I added it to my Keychain. However, when I try to sign the installer I get the \"productsign: error: Could not find appropriate signing identity for [common name]\" error.\nproductsign does not complain when I sign with a 3rd Party Mac Installer certificate that I requested (which of course is not the Developer ID required by Gatekeeper), while it does complain with another 3rd Party Mac Installercertificate requested by another member and freely available for download.\nTherefore I figure it has something to do with the private key of my Team Agent missing, but I don't like one bit the idea that my Team Agent has to share HIS PERSONAL PRIVATE KEY with any developer wanting to sign a Mac Installer. Is it alright to ask my Team Agent his private key? Will it solve the problem?\nCan someone confirm this is the right way to do things?\n[EDIT] I thougth right now that maybe the right way is to ask my Team Agent to generate a new Developer ID Installer with a .csr (CertSignignRequest) file coming from my Keychain. If my intuition is correct the .csr file contains the private key so that the resulting .cer is valid for that particular user. Is it so?\n\nA: Yes, I guess that each Developer ID Installer is related to the public / private key  with which the CSR was generated.\n", "Q: MacBook display has vertical black and white lines on startup My MackBook, on startup, its showing the following:\n\nThey are just a bunch of vertical black and white lines, and it gets stuck there.\nWhat could be the problem?\n\nA: It's definitely hardware.  It's either the display has gone bad or your GPU (logic board) has gone bad (most likely case)\nThe first thing I would do is hook it up to an external monitor.  If it's present there as well, then you know it's GPU/logic board related.   If it goes away, then run Apple Hardware Test (AHT) to get some details.

It almost fully succeeds (75%) to reinstall iOS, however iTunes then says Unknown Error (-1). I have read online that this could mean a hardware failure, but since the phone is able to get 75% of the way reinstalled, and it looks fine inside, surely nothing too serious has occurred. I don't care if I have to reinstall officially or via special software or jailbreak, as long as I can get this phone running again. Also, after iTunes displays the error, the phone just sits at the 75% mark on the installation screen (Apple logo with bar underneath).\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: I'd try putting the phone in DFU mode (Device Firmware Update).

The iPhone uses your Apple ID to secure multiple layers within the software stack on the iPhone, such that it is impossible for anyone or any tool to access your phone without your password. This is done on purpose, so that neither Apple, a bad guy or good guys acting like bad guys, can access your personal data.\nThis Apple Support article suggests that you can wipe your iPhone, and start all over, losing your data.

This tool is designed to verify your EFI firmware by reading data from the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash and verifying its signature is valid (i.e. it hasn't been tampered with). Basically it's doing this to prevent system stability and security issues.\nSo, if you had installed either of these betas, that would explain what caused  this. If you didn't install either of those betas, then I'm at a loss - except to say it's highly likely the eficheck tool will be included in the public release of macOS Sierra 10.12.5. I don't believe it was a part of the public release of mac OS Sierra 10.12.4.\nEither way, you can check for it by entering the kextstat command in Terminal and searching the output via the Find CommandF shortcut and searching for eficheck.kext (or part thereof).\nI see the file eficheck.bin, how can I tell if my EFI firmware is OK?\nOnce again, I'm working on the assumption you had the beta installed. If so, I would not worry about it as many users reported seeing this even though their firmware was not modified etc.\nAfter sending this to Apple, what happens next?\nIf you choose to send the relevant data to Apple, only the unexpected changes in your computer’s firmware and only general details of your computer (such as model) are collected and transmitted. In terms of what happens next, well, I'm not sure exactly what Apple will do with this data. Only time will tell.\nMore information was available at: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT207475 but it's since been removed (it was there as recently as three days ago). I include it here because I expect Apple will republish it after the release of macOS Sierra 10.12.5.

It works to get power to the computer but it keeps coming off depending on the angle I try to remove from the computer.  Anyone here have an idea if it's possible to glue or fix it?\n\nA: This can be fixed with an application of Super Glue or other adhesive for metals.\nFirst, clean it with acetone - use a cotton swab (like a Q-Tip) to ensure that the metal is clean.  This will help the adhesive bond properly\nUsing a small amount of adhesive that is made for bonding metals like Super Glue, place it around the edges of the part to be repaired.  Hold for at least a minute (the set time for the adhesive) and you should be good.  For best results, allow to cure for an hour before use.

I did that yesterday. Currently it stands at:\nVersion 10.12.4\nMacBook Pro (Retina,13-inch, Early 2015)\nProcessor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5\nMemory 8 GB 1867 MHz DDr3\nAfter this update,when my Mac goes to sleep or is shut down, about half of the time it displays the flashing ?, prompting hand-wringing from me. I start going through all of the steps for system restore, but often the SSD is not located during the system restore, and when I restart again maybe the mac finds the SSD and starts up normally. This is very annoying behaviour, of course.\nI have had the flashing ? before, and I took it to an Apple service center in Trondheim where they held it for a month before returning it to me, with the diagnosis that the hard drive had unmounted physically and all that was required was re-inserting it. Great. Glad that took only a month.\nI am tempted to believe that this is a physical hardware issue where the hard drive is experiencing intermittent hardware connection. But I've never experienced it shutting down in use, as you would think would happen if it were something like a loose connector, which makes me doubt this hypothesis. \nI asked this question on the apple forum, and I'm going to be reprimanded for the solution that I'm leaning towards: removing the back panel myself and staking the hard drive to the connector with adhesive. Taking it to a service center is unworkable for the following reasons: a) Because I'm currently on a Greek island in the middle of the aegean, and b) because I can't afford to lose my Mac for a month again for some tech to do what I want, which he probably won't because staking a hard drive isn't in the Apple book.\nAny ideas here? I mention the Sierra update because of course, a lot of signs point to that, but the intermittent startups make me think that is circumstantial.\n\nA: I'd do a NVRAM and SMC reset (in that order). Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nReset the NVRAM on your MBP as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your MBP reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your MBP reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\nThere's a couple of ways you can reset the SMC on your MBP, however I prefer the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your computer to determine if the issue still persists. \n", "Q: Can I have Windows share disk space with macOS? I want to dual boot between macOS and Windows 10. But I don't want to give each a fixed amount of disk space, which is hard to change later. I instead want to keep it flexible so that at some times, macOS can use more disk space, and at other times, Windows.\nHow do I do this without using a VM? I don't need or want to run both OSs at once. I want to dual boot.\nCan I install Windows and ask it to boot from a disk image or sparse image on the HFS+ filesystem? Or, alternatively, boot macOS from a disk image on an NTFS filesystem?\nOr is that some LVM stuff that works for this?\n\nA: Short answer \nNo, it is not possible (to my knowledge, at this time) to boot into one of the other operating systems from a disk image stored on another partition.\nWhat I have done in the past is make a third partition that I use to share files between the two. I make both boot partitions large enough to store the most important things and then a third that I can store other files on whether they be Windows files or Mac files. It isn't a perfect solution but at least that way if you want more space for Mac stuff then you can format that partition in HFS+. If you want more space for Windows stuff you can format that partition in NTFS or exFAT or something.\nIf you do decide to do something like that then look into the proper way of doing so before you try. It isn't an easy process but it is at least easier than trying to do what you suggested. You can find some instructions on Ubuntu's website that help explain how to set up a triple boot system. Follow those instructions and just skip the step where you install Ubuntu. Instead, leave the last partition empty for storing stuff. \nIMPORTANT: Don't forget to backup everything before trying any sort of partitioning on your main drive. You were warned.\nAnother option is to install a second drive if possible. I have an older MacBook Pro and I took the DVD drive out and put a second drive in its place. Thats the absolute easiest thing to do if you can.\nAs to your question about LVM. CoreStorage would allow you to set up partitions that can be resized later and the like, but Windows cannot boot from a CoreStorage partition. CoreStorage is strictly a macOS technology that no other OS recognizes. But that is a longer story for another time.\nLonger answer\nYour Mac's firmware that is in charge of finding and mounting a bootable partition does not have that ability. Maybe, just maybe in the Linux world that is possible but I'm not sure. But I know a Mac's firmware doesn't have that capability because that is not something 99.9999% of people would want to do.\nWhen your Mac turns on the firmware (the baked in software that is stored on a chip on the motherboard) is in charge of finding a partition on your hard drive with an operating system that can boot. When booting to macOS the firmware (EFI on a Mac) finds a special partition on your hard drive called EFI (yes, the same name as the firmware), mounts that partition, and lets the software (called a boot loader) take over the boot process. The EFI is very small and has very limited capabilities since it has to live in a small chip on the motherboard. The boot loader can do more because the EFI partition on your hard drive is large enough to store a bigger program.\nThe boot loader then mounts the other drives on your disk and finds the partitions with macOS and depending on which drive you selected in the System Preferences it will boot macOS from the partition you chose (you can have many different partitions on the same hard drive with macOS installed on any of them).\nWhen booting to Windows on a Mac your EFI does things a little differently. As far as I understand the boot loader on the EFI partition isn't used to boot Windows. Instead, the Windows installer puts a little chunk of code at the very beginning of you drive in the tiny space called the MBR. That space is measured in bytes. Not even kilobytes. Just bytes. It is absolutely tiny. So you can't do much with the boot loader stored there. All it does is find the Windows partition and direct the CPU there to finish booting. There is no space on the Windows boot loader to do much of anything else at all. Especially not to mount a drive, find the correct disk image on that drive and then mount and boot from that disk image. It wouldn't come close to fitting in the MBR.\nGoing back to the EFI partition there may be a chance of fitting enough software on that partition to do all the work necessary to boot from a disk image but again I'm not sure its possible. I'm not familiar enough with the boot process to know if it is. All I know for sure is that the current EFI and boot loader do not support anything like you are asking for.\nMaking a boot loader that does what you are looking for may be possible but it would require a lot of work and a strong understanding of how the whole boot process works.\nThe point is it would be a much better use of your time figuring out a better way to partition your hard drive then to try and mount one using a disk image.\nI tried to explain things as best as I understand them but I may be wrong. Someone please correct me if I am.\n", "Q: How to find out which cipher suites an iOS application uses? I'm trying to find out which cipher suites and SSL/TLS protocol an app uses.

Each value has a date that it occurred but the dates aren't equally spaced. Numbers is showing them as if they were equally spaced. Is it possible to plot them relative to their point in time?\n\nA: you need an x-y scatter (or a x-y balloon, though I haven't tried this one) The most important part is to NOT USE the row and column headers! enter your data in two columns, the first column is the time data formatted as such, the second column is the value corresponding to the time. Numbers is not very good at charting. The category style charts are flat out misleading for time-series data, it should not be charted as categories on the x-axis! (this is not just confined to numbers - the other spreadsheets are just as bad). Good luck. You may be able to put the time in any order, and also have multiple y columns (dependant variables). I may get back to you on this one.\n\nA: This can't be done with an area graph. You need to use a scatter graph, or to insert hidden rows for each increment missing. This has been an annoyance of mine for a long time — I have provided feedback to Apple and you may do so too.\n", "Q: What is causing Safari to crash when dragging image or text? I've recently been encountering an issue whereby dragging either an image or selected text on a webpage causes Safari (10.1, on El Capitan 10.11.6) to force reload the page (not a real 'crash', I guess, but a semi-crash). The page gets a slim alert banner at the top saying “A problem occurred with this webpage so it was reloaded” and a modal alert box pops up saying “Safari Web Content quit unexpectedly. Click Report to see more detailed information and to send a report to Apple.”\nI've got a two screen setup with this iMac: the iMac's own retina screen, and a 'regular' resolution screen connected via VGA-thunderbolt adaptor. Further investigation has revealed that the ‘drag crash’ only occurs if the browser window is on the Retina screen. And it only seems to happen in Safari, not Chrome.\nA workaround would be to move the browser to the regular screen before dragging anything, but that doesn't really gel with my workflow.\nAnyone have any ideas how I can stop this from happening?\nThanks. \n\nA: Seems to have something to do with the color profile.\nChanging it to either Generic RGB or sRGB IEC61966-2.1 prevents the crash, if you can live with the uncalibrated color scheme.\nMore here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/31703564#message31703564\n", "Q: Is disabling spell check systemwide still possible in Sierra?

The MacBook was sold to me as refurbished at a very reliable retailer. I don't think it's a hardware issue, I did the NVM and SMC reset. Even created a new \"test\" new administrator user account, that made notes sync well, until my iPhone got involved.\n\nA: Since you have a backup, why not boot to Internet Recovery and reinstall a brand new OS and test things. If there is something wrong with the hardware, you surely can get a feeling of that with a clean install.\nThe reliable retailer would likely help you if you can show that a clean install causes issues.

So just wanted to know if this is normal? Or is there anything I can do for this? Would I be damaging the battery this way. I really don't want to use the MagSafe adapter because of how the cables are setup now. Thanks in advance for your help!\n\n\nA: What you are seeing is the \"current draw\" for charging the battery.  This will fluctuate and is perfectly normal.\n\nYou will see this fluctuate more so when the battery is full or nearly fully charged when it doesn't need much current to bring it back up to 100%.  When it reaches full charge, there's no need for full current draw.\nThe 2015 rMBP has either a 60W or 85W power adapter (13\" or 15\" respectively).  54W draw is well within the limit of either adapter which means (to use a Star Trek: TNG phrase) it's operating within normal parameters.  The 54W is just the draw at this particular time; charging the battery and powering the MBP.  Crank up some processes (like video editing) and your draw will go up.

Symptoms: Command-R on boot only takes me to Internet Recovery, and a dated one at that (Lion I believe). Recovery HD still shows up on the main volume in terminal diskutil list (see below), but I can't get into it.\nMy setup, dual drive with SSD in main slot and HD in optibay:\n\n\n*\n\n*Crucial M550 SSD 1TB with about ~720GB full (\"Macbook Pro SSD\") as main volume in the SATA HD slot. 80GB Win10 Bootcamp partition on the same drive.\n\n*Original Macbook HD installed in DVD slot. Not really relevant but this drive is partitioned into a second bootable Sierra partition and a \"Media HD\" drive for files. OS drive is not encrypted and the recovery partion works fine and is visible to select when booting and holding Opt key (but not Cmd-R). \"Media HD\" is encrypted.\n\n*Relevant: I first noticed the issue after I encrypted the SSD using Filevault (but it could have been before as I haven't booted into Recovery for a long time). The process completed successfully including optimization. After that I was able to wipe out an older Bootcamp partition, create a new one and installed Windows 10 successfully.\n\n\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalled Sierra maybe 3x in different ways, once from the Applications folder, once from the second internal volume using a bootable createinstallmedia Sierra install disc partition, and once using the recovery partition on the HD.

Once that disc was gone, I was back to internet recovery.\n\n*I tried http://musings.silvertooth.us/2016/10/recovery-partition-4-0-4/, including disabling SIP first using the terminal in recovery options from the install disk USB (I think the older Internet Recovery wouldn't work or didn't recognize the command).

After some rearranging my bedroom, I had to replace my US plug power adapter to a 3rd party UK plug power adapter, whenever I plug my iPad Air 2 into the 3rd party charger, the screen starts to glitch and it acts almost like there is another (invisible) finger constantly on the screen, this causes issues when selecting different keyboards, playing games, typing and scrolling through internet. But when I remove the iPad from charging, this issue doesn't happen... it's almost like the touch screen having a weird spasm whenever it's got water droplets on it.\nWhen I had my old original Apple US plug adapter, this problem never happened, also I replaced the original short and fragile Apple charging cord to another one that is 3 metres (although I don't think that the cable is the issue because I've been using it for a very long time). \nThis issue is quite new to me and i am quite unsure whether it's the iPad itself or the power adapter...\nWhat should I do?\nThanks,\nSid.\n\nA: It's almost certainly the fact you're using the 3rd party UK plug power adapter (although it's not clear to me how you're doing this).\nRegardless, as a simple test to confirm, all you need to do is plug your iPad into a USB port (e.g. on your Mac/PC) using the same cable. If the problem doesn't repeat itself, you have your answer. \nIf it does still occur, you know then that's it's likely the cable or iPad itself. You could then double-check there's nothing inside the Lighting port of your iPad causing interference/conductivity issues. If there's nothing obvious, retest by using another cable.\n\nA: I encountered this exact scenario under different conditions.\nApple UK 5W folding-pin mains adapter + 2m Amazon Basics lightning cable\nThis has always worked fine when used with standard mains supply.  But I used the same combination on a train which had power sockets at each seat and experienced the same screen/touch glitches on my iPhone 7Plus.  Unplugging the adaptor instantly resolved the issue.\nSo - It would appear the same issue can be caused by what I assume was a below-spec electricity supply.\n\nA: Recent findings....\nFor few days I have been experimenting which component is causing these screen spasms... here are my findings,\nApple adapter + Apple cable = no interference \nApple adapter + 3rd party cable = no interference\n3rd party adapter + Apple cable = interference \n3rd party adapter + 3rd party cable = interference\nPlease note, the original Apple cable that came with my iPad had a slit just before the lightning plug, but this didn't play any role of the interference on my iPad, I had also eliminated the chances that my slit cable was causing interference by using my mum's cable from her iPad Air 2.\nConclusion...\nThe testing and the results shows that the 3rd party adapter did cause the interference, initially I thought it was the screen protector, as it was cracked slightly, bit even when I removed it the interference was still evident. So right now, I can confidently say that some 3rd party adapters do not work well with the iPad, although in my case it didn't damage the iPad itself, please be careful when buying 3rd party adapters, always check the rating before buying, for me the rating was the same as the original Apple adapter.\nPictures of the culprit 3rd party adapter...\n\n\nFYI - I used the 2.1 amp socket in the plug (labelled 2.1A) and I haven't yet tested the 1 amp socket yet whether it will still produce the screen interference. The adapter seems to be unbranded and manufactured from China, and was bought by my dad a very long time ago from Amazon to replace his faulty iPhone 4s adapter. \n", "Q: How can I determine where network data is going?

Please don't tell me it is the speaker magnet. I assure you it is not. Have had it a couple years, and this just started a few months ago. It will pick up nuts and bolts, I can toss it up against my fridge, it will stick. Same on my gunsafe, toolbox, car, and anything else metallic. This is not normal, and not healthy. So what is the answer? Anyone?\n\nA: I know you said Please don't tell me it is the speaker magnet, but I have opened a number of iPhone 5 phones and this is the only magnetic part within the whole iPhone 5 - so it can't be anything else.\nAnd when you say I assure you it is not the speaker magnet, how do you know? What evidence do you have?\nThe reality is it can't be anything else. If you check this iPhone 5 teardown you'll see everything that's inside your iPhone 5. While some parts are magnetic in the sense that they will stick to a magnet, the only magnetic source is the speaker magnet. \nAlso, because the iPhone comes with a compass, it has been very carefully designed so that any magnetic fields do not interfere with that. In other words, Apple hasn't placed any unnecessary magnets in the phone except for the speaker magnet (which can't be avoided).\nFinally, while I'm no medical expert, the concern around mobile phones has always been around the electrical signals they require to operate, not about magnets. If you're concerned you can use an appropriate case (if you haven't already got one) and/or use a bluetooth earpiece/headset for calls.\n", "Q: How to invoke osascript 'Generic Scripting System'? The terminal command osalang list the following installed OSA languages supported by osascript.\nAppleScript\nJavaScript\nGeneric Scripting System\n\nUsing AppleScript or JavaScript works. For example:\nosascript -l JavaScript \\\n    -e 'Application(\"iTunes\").currentTrack.name()'\n\nHowever, something like to following returns a \"found unknown token\" error.\nosascript -l 'Generic Scripting System' \\\n    -e '#!/bin/bash' \\\n    -e 'echo $HOME'\n\nHow does one invoke osascript for 'Generic Scripting System' from the command line for some non-AppleScript, non-JavaScript scripting ... without using any (intermediate) AppleScript or JavaScript?  Is this even possible?\n\nA: According to OS X system internals, the \"Generic Scripting System\" is a generic class to contain the two flavors of scripting supported:\n\n\n*\n\n*AppleScript\n\n*JavaScript\n\n\nIt's not some third option that adds one or more new dialects, but a container to hold the existing ones. This is indirectly explained in Apple's documentation - they list the two languages and don't mention the wrapper class (or whatever it's proper name is):\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Automation Scripting Guide -  part of which is the list of languages\nIf you needed other languages, I would call AppleScript \"do shell script...\" to then call whatever shell executable that ships by Apple or you have installed (bash, sh, python, swift, perl, ...).\n\nA: What osalang is actually doing, is talking to the Component Manager and returning all components of type osa  (the space at the end is intentional, since this is an OSType aka FourCC). The Component Manager is a software plugin framework which was originally introduced on Classic Mac OS, first for use by QuickTime, and was later heavily used by many Classic Mac OS components, among others Open Scripting Architecture (OSA). In OS X / macOS (and\nespecially so in recent versions), it has been deprecated and is used far less than Classic Mac OS used it, since there are now much better alternatives (such as Objective C classes). The only two things in recent macOS releases that still use Component Manager are OSA and certain audio APIs. (By contrast, in Classic Mac OS it was used for a lot of other stuff, like QuickDraw GX and ColorSync, which have since been replaced by newer technologies.)\nSo, macOS comes with three osa  type components out of the box: ascr (AppleScript), jscr (JavaScript), and scpt (Generic Scripting System). Developers can register additional components to implement further OSA languages, although that is rarely done. What scpt does, is it isn't actually a language, instead it is a programming layer which developers can talk to instead of having to talk directly to the underlying scripting components such as ascr and jscr. Think of it like a middleman, an intermediary. If you look at the macOS SDK, you can find its API declared in OSAGeneric.h which can be found in OpenScripting framework. One of the features it adds to the underlying OSA language components, is routing of .scpt files. Basically, a program (such as osascript or \"Script Editor\") can call an API (OSALoad) to load a .scpt file. There is a field in the file header or trailer which states which actual scripting language is being used. The Generic Scripting System contains the code to interpret that file header/trailer and then sends the contents of the .scpt file to the appropriate language engine. So, talking to \"Generic Scripting System\", instead of directly to the underlying language engines, is actually important for developers if they want to support loading .scpt files in any language.\n", "Q: Does \"pmset schedule wake\" work when the lid is closed at the designated time? I am using Air, which is in the sleep mode almost all day. I want to have it run a shell script every morning, so I set my Air to wake up at 7:00 using \"pmset\" command and run the script at 7:01 using another command. However, this does not work when the lid is closed and is unconnected to power at 7:00, and the script is not run until I wake it up by myself. \nDoes \"pmset schedule wake\" work when the lid is closed and connected to power? \n\nA: My understanding is no, because the act of having the lid closed is designed to put the Air to sleep (this is done with magnets). The only exception is closed clamshell mode where you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*power connected\n\n*display connected\n\n*external keyboard + mouse or trackpad (bluetooth or USB)\n\n\nYou can watch the power events with pmset -g pslog so if you were to set a wake and then have terminal.app or other command line to watch the log, you could look at things when you wake up the Mac via lid open or external display. Power Nap would be the only way you might get some events run with the lid closed and not in clamshell mode.\nAlso, while I haven't tried doing what you're trying to, I have noticed that allowing 5 minutes for a scheduled wake event is usually a better way to go.\nSo you could try running the script a little later (e.g. 7:05), or perhaps setting the Air to wake at 6:56. However, as I stated above, the lid being closed means the magnet will trigger a sleep event.\n", "Q: How can I get full information from Console in macOS Sierra?

My trusty MBP 17\" 2011 is now hitting the failing AMD GPU issues.\nThis is what I understand from my research:\n\n\n*\n\n*This has been a known problem, and Apple addressed with an extended warranty on these models's GPUs, which ended Dec 31st 2016.  My local repair shop, which is usually pretty handy, says it can't fix it.\n\n*You can revert to using just the internal Intel graphics.  Basically, boot into Single User mode and move some of AMD*.kext files from /System/Library/Extensions/ elsewhere.\nThis covers it pretty well:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyDu-Y_G1D8&app=desktop\n\n\n*Unfortunately, the System/Library/Extensions directory fall under Sierra's SIP protection so I can't carry out those instructions. crutils disable, to disable SIP, won't work in Single User mode. SIP can only be disabled in Recovery mode... which fails because it is a graphical environment and I have a failing GPU.\n\n\n[EDIT re point 3 only] (as far as just the SIP issues goes:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/276433 is correct: Cmd + R + S, at least on Sierra, gets you recovery and single user and you can csrutil disable from there).\nQuestion: Can I do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot my Mac from a bootable Linux USB, mount the HD and move those AMD*.kext using Linux, thereby forcing use of the Intel graphics?\n\n\nAnyone have any experience doing such a thing?  A particular challenge I have is that I'd have to prep the bootable USB from a Windows or Linux machine, as my Mac is stuck in single-user mode.\nWhat Linux distribution/USB prep tool should I be using?  Mind you, I don't need to boot into a graphical Linux, just the command line is good enough and less likely to hit the GPU issue.\n\nA: There is a fix to this that allows you to bypass the discrete GPU and always use the integrated GPU! You will have to boot into archlinux to bypass SIP and disable the discrete graphics card.\nMoving just the AMD Kexts will allow you to boot up the Mac, but it will be very sluggish and slow. Following this method will allow you to completely use your Mac again!

The application is live since I can see it in the Task manager (Command+Tab)  I wonder if there is something that I can do from the Terminal command line.\nPlease, no external apps suggestions, if possible!\nThanks.\n\nA: Your description is a bit difficult to understand, but if you got an application window outside of the screen area and you need it moved without dragging, then this should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the native Script Editor application.\n\n*Open a new blank document and paste in the following code:\ntell application \"Microsoft Word\" to set bounds of window 1 to {0, 22, 600, 622}\n\n\n*Click the play button to run the code.\nThis should move the Word document window to the top left of your screen and resize the window to 600x600px (note that this will only move 1 window).\n\nA: Powerpoint usually does this for me and I usually solve the problem by switching to the app, and although it's screen is offscreen, the menu bar is accessible, so you can do Window -> Zoom. This brings the app, even if it's offscreen to your current screen area.\nObviously this only works if your app has a menu bar, and supports the zoom / maximise functionality. Most OSX apps are fine (Word included), but you might still need alternatives when using for example XQuartz based apps.\n", "Q: Why does McAfee Endpoint Protection keep auto installing? I want to know how I can permanent uninstall McAfee Endpoint Protection. I've used the uninstall command found here, and it works. It uninstalls the software. But after some time it will auto install itself again. Is there somehow a way I can prevent that from happening?\n\nA: More than likely, you are on a corporate owned/controlled computer and they have installed the ePO (ePolicy Orchestrator) agent deployed on your machine.  This is a mangagement tool that allows your organization to ensure that end point security is installed and updated.  Additionally, it will reinstall the software if it happens to be uninstalled.\nIt's working as it should.\nFrom McAfee's web page:\n\nThe McAfee Agent is the distributed component of McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (McAfee ePO). It downloads and enforces policies, and executes client-side tasks such as deployment and updating. The Agent also uploads events and provides additional data regarding each system’s status. It must be installed on each system in your network that you wish to manage. The agent collects and sends event information at intervals to the McAfee ePO server. It also installs and updates the endpoint products, and applies your endpoint policies. Systems cannot be managed by McAfee ePO unless the McAfee Agent is installed.\n\n(Emphasis mine).  \nUnless you have rights to remove the ePO agent, you won't be able to uninstall the software.  Even if you were able to uninstall the software or boot from a different drive to which you had rights, the ePO server would, after a predetermined amount of time, alert the admins that your machine is no longer checking in at which point they would find out what/how you circumvented the security.\n", "Q: Can Sierra be installed on a virtual machine created by Parallels Desktop 10? I’ve just stumbled across this site by accident and you good folk may be my last good hope before I abandon this endeavour. \nMy questions are simple: \n\n\n*\n\n*Can Sierra be installed on a virtual\nmachine created by Parallels Desktop 10? \n\n*If 'yes' to 1, how do I do this?\n—BACKGROUND—\nI’ve heard a lot of conflicting stories about Sierra and would like to test it before taking the plunge of upgrading. I have a 27 inch mid 2011 iMac maxed out with 32GB RAM. I regularly run virtual machines in Parallels Desktop 10. These VMs (Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1) all work splendidly, so I figure I could try running Sierra on a virtual machine too.\nI’ve read Apple’s licensing conditions and this is legal. Since my iMac is capable of running Sierra natively, my conclusion is my hardware will run Sierra fine in a virtual machine too.\nNow the problem…I can’t seem to create a Sierra virtual machine in Parallels Desktop 10. \nI’ve tried following and adapting the steps found at this discussion forum (https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/143196), but with no joy to be found. Only frustration!\nI’ve searched online (including here!) and cannot find confirmation anywhere that I can even do this on Parallels 10. Nothing to say it can be done. Nothing to say it cannot be done.\nApparently I have to purchase Parallels Desktop 12, or get my hands on Parallels Desktop 11 (cheaper) and create an El Capitan virtual machine and then upgrade to Sierra from within the VM (see http://blog.parallels.com/2016/06/16/macos-sierra-vm/). Thing is, I have no reason to upgrade from Parelles Desktop 10 as it meets my needs otherwise. Besides, Apple doesn’t charge for Sierra so why should I spend money to install it on a virtual machine? \nIn principle I believe this should be possible somehow and I’m frustrated within myself that I can’t seem to do it! \n\nA: Yes, this is possible. \nIt’s not actually too hard, but there’s a lot of steps (a couple of which can be fiddly) so be patient and read this carefully. I’ll try and outline all the steps involved, but feel free to let me know if you get stuck at all. \nAlso, some of these steps are not strictly necessary, but I’m trying to make this foolproof so that it's useful to other users, and also because I want to ensure that my Terminal command at Step 12 can just be copied and pasted.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iMac, download the macOS Sierra installer via the Mac App Store\n\n*After its downloaded, the installer will launch automatically. When it does, quit the installer.\n\n*Grab a USB flash drive of at least 8GB in size\n\n*Connect the USB flash drive to your Mac\n\n*Launch the Disk Utility app (by default it’s in the Applications > Utilities folder)\n\n*Select the USB flash drive on the lefthand side\n\n*Click on the Erase tab\n\n*Do not change the default name of Untitled\n\n*Click on the Erase button (do not worry about any of the other settings). Note this will totally erase your drive!\n\n*Quit Disk Utility\n\n*Launch the Terminal app (by default it’s in the Applications > Utilities folder)\n\n*Now enter the following command into Terminal. It may be best to just copy it from here (try triple-clicking) and paste it in. \nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\n*You will be prompted to enter your user password. Enter it now and press return (note that you won’t see the cursor move or display any of the characters you enter)\n\n*At the next prompt (about erasing your drive) press the Y key\n\n*Wait for your USB flash drive to be erased (you’ll see the progress via % values appearing within the Terminal window)\n\n*Once the erasure is complete, you will see a prompt that files are being copied to the disk. This may take a while, so be patient.\n\n*Eventually the copy process will be over and you should see a Done message in Terminal. You can now quit Terminal.\n\n*Now launch Parallels.\n\n*Go to File > New (or press commandN)\n\n*In the window that appears, select the Install Windows or another OS from a DVD or image file option\n\n*Click on the Continue button at bottom right\n\n*At the next window, ignore what Parallels is searching for and click on the Continue button again\n\n*At the next window, give your virtual machine a name and select the location you want it created in\n\n*Now, click on the checkbox to indicate you want to Customize settings before installation\n\n*Click on the Continue button\n\n*Parallels will now create your virtual machine\n\n*When complete, you will be presented with the configuration settings\n\n*Click on the Hardware tab\n\n*Select the Boot Order option in the left hand list\n\n*On the righthand side, tick the Select boot device on startup checkbox. This is a temporary, but critical step!\n\n*Feel free to configure your other settings for the virtual machine \n\n*Once you’ve configured everything, exit the configuration screen\n\n*Click on the Continue button\n\n*You should see a message that your virtual machine is starting. Wait until you see the Boot Menu appear (it’ll probably be a grey screen with blue and black text on it).\n\n*The Continue option will probably be selected. Ignore this and use your down arrow key to select the Boot Maintenance Manager option\n\n*Press return\n\n*Once the Boot Maintenance Manager window appears, use your down arrow key to select the Boot From File option\n\n*Press return\n\n*Once the File Explorer window appears, use your down arrow key to select the second file listed\n\n*Press return\n\n*In the next window, use your down arrow key to select the .IABootFiles option\n\n*Press return\n\n*In the next window boot.efi should be preselected\n\n*Press return\n\n*Shortly the Apple logo should appear on a black screen\n\n\nNow you can follow the prompts to install macOS Sierra. \nNOTE 1: - Once you’re within the Boot Menu screens (i.e. Steps 34 - 44) you can press the ESC key at any stage to go back to the previous screen if you need to.\nNOTE 2: - Please be patient - the macOS Sierra installation process can take a long time within a virtual machine!\nNOTE 3: - Once you're all set up, you will want to go back into the configuration settings for your macOS Sierra virtual machine and uncheck the Select boot device on startup checkbox you ticked at Step 30.\nNOTE 4: - If you get stuck at any stage, feel free to post a comment below.\n", "Q: Windows 10 partition disappeared after resizing My Windows partition disappeared after resizing it.

I already have an old IPH5 which has been well used so the new one is preferable. Can I just transfer my SIM from my old IPH5 to the new one?\n\nA: Yes, this is possible.\nHowever, if you want to keep all your data etc, you will need to do a full backup of your old iPhone (e.g. to iTunes on your Mac/PC) first and then connect the new iPhone to do a restore from the old backup. This assumes, of course, that the new iPhone has at least the same capacity as the old one.

Is it possible to get something like a symbolic link/alias to direct to another folder on an external hard drive and still have the files display on the desktop?\nI used:\nsudo rm -rf ~/Desktop\nsudo ln -s /Volumes/<partition_label>/Desktop ~/Desktop\n\nBut the Desktop is just blank, and when I drag files onto the Desktop, they disappear and are copied to /Volumes/<partition_label>/Desktop\nI recently tried replacing the Desktop with an alias instead, but I now only get a cancel icon popping up next to the cursor when I drag a file over it.  The partition is exFat so it's compatible with my tri-boot. I'm doing this so files are automatically available on each Desktop.\nAny ideas to get this working?\nI was also thinking about an alternative, something that automatically moved a file to /Volumes/<partition_label>/Desktop/<file_name> when it was dragged to ~/Desktop and replaced with a symbolic link or alias on ~/Desktop.  Is that a viable alternative?\n\nA: You can create a folder hard link using coreutils. Remove the symlink you created and install Homebrew if you don't already have it, then brew install coreutils and use:\nsudo gln /Volumes/<partition_label>/Desktop ~/Desktop\n\n(Be careful with removing hard links, since the destination will be deleted if you delete normally. To delete a hard link, use unlink ~/Desktop.)\n\nA: I figured it out, using bindfs, I believe you need to install OSXFUSE:\n\n\n*\n\n*brew install bindfs (if you have homebrew installed - easy way) (or you can build it from source - slightly harder)\n\n*cp -R ~/Desktop/  /Volumes/<partition_label>/Desktop/ To move all files from your local Desktop to the partition's Desktop folder.\n\n*rm -rf ~/Desktop && mkdir ~/Desktop Will delete and create new Desktop folder.\n\n*bindfs /Volumes/<partition_label>/Desktop ~/Desktop Mounts the Desktop folder on the partition to your Desktop folder.\n\n\nNote that with this method, all items that are dragged from your system partition to the Desktop are copied-not moved-and that if you delete any files from within the mounted file system, they are not sent to the trash, rather they are permanently deleted.\n", "Q: How to change the default domain suffix for iPad Pro on screen keyboard?

I have a list of folders which have dates for names. The dates are in the format YYYYMMDD (e.g. 20150129). Within these folders are text documents which are related to that specific date.\nI would like to restructure them in a folder hierarchy going from year to month to date, and to move the text documents into the corresponding 'date' folder lower down in the hierarchy.\nIn other words I would like the 'root' folder to be named after the year like 2015, and then create sub-folders named with months like 01, and then create further sub-folders named with dates like 29 which hold the corresponding text documents.\nSo the path would look like 2015/01/29/file.txt or 2015>01>29>file.txt.\nI have taken a look at Automator and it seems that something like this is not possible although I could be wrong, so I would like to know...\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there some easy solution to this problem that any layman can understand, for example an Automator workflow, or does this require some understanding of terminal commands and regular expressions?\n\n*How would one solve this problem provided there is in fact a solution?\n\nA: You can use the following in Terminal. cd to the containing folder, then run the following:\nfind . -type f -exec bash -c \\\n  'F=$(sed -E \"s#^\\./([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})#\\1/\\2/\\3#\" <<< $1);\\\n  mkdir -p -- $(dirname \"$F\");\\\n  mv -- \"$1\" \"$F\"' - {} \\;\n\nfind . -type f obtains every file in the current directory recursively.\n-exec bash -c opens a shell to run the following commands.\nF=$(…) opens a subshell and uses sed on the file path to manipulate the path into the folders.\n^\\./([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2}) is a regex with three capture groups, as follows:\n\n\\1/\\2/\\3 is replacement, where each capture group (\\1, etc) are separated by /.\nmkdir -p -- $(dirname \"$F\") creates the directories to move the files into.\nmv -- \"$1\" \"$F\" moves each file into its corresponding folder.\nThis takes the hierarchy on the left and converts it to the hierarchy on the right:\n\n\n├── 20170201               └── 2017\n│   └── abcdefghij             ├── 02\n└── 20170302                   │   └── 01\n    └── abcdefghij 2           │       └── abcdefghij\n                               └── 03\n                                   └── 02\n                                       └── abcdefghij 2\n\nIf there are other files in the containing folder with a date as a name, they will be moved as if they are a folder. To prevent this, replace the second line with:\n  'F=$(sed -E \"s#^\\./([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})(?:/.+)#\\1/\\2/\\3#\" <<< $1);\\\n\nThe (?:/.+) ensures that the path has a subsequent component, therefore ignoring anything without a child in the parent directory which are files.\n\nA: Assuming all these YYYYMMDD folders are part of the same parent directory you could run\ncd PARENT_DIRECTORY\nfor d in */; do\n    [[ $d =~ [0-9]{8}/ ]] || continue\n    mkdir -p -- \"${d:0:4}/${d:4:2}\"\n    mv -- \"$d\" \"${d:0:4}/${d:4:2}/${d:6:2}\"\ndone\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The for d in */; do loop reads all directory entries, the trailing / ensures that only directory names actually match\n\n*[[ $d =~ [0-9]{8}/ ]] tests whether the current entry consists of 8 digits, and continues with the next entry if not\n\n*${d:0:4}/${d:4:2}/${d:6:2} uses parameter expansion within bash to create a string containing the new path\n\n*The -- in both mkdir and mv prevents problem in case the directory or file name starts with a -. This can't happen here but it's probably good practice anyway.\n\n\n\nThanks to @terdon and @user3439894 for ideas on how to improve the original script.\n", "Q: Why are some users visible with encrypted system partition on macOS Sierra?

You can use a disk password, recovery key or allowed user passwords to unlock a FileVault disk.\nWhen you do it the \"normal way\" as you mentioned above you won't end up with a disk password. No big deal.\nIt sounds like User 1 isn't allowed to unlock the disk in this case. You can use the fdesetup command for things like this. For example, to see which users are allowed to unlock the disk:\n$ sudo fdesetup list\nPassword:\nmacmanager, 51361A22-B6F2-4384-8E0D-F4973BE74957\n\nWhile logged in as any user you can look in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault and if some users aren't allowed to unlock the disk there will be a warning with a button to enable users.\nYou can also use fdesetup to add users to the list, assuming you know their password:\n$ sudo fdesetup add -usertoadd davem\nEnter a password for '/', or the recovery key:\nEnter the password for the added user 'davem':\n\n", "Q: Connection hangs with Fugu cannot connect I've seen Fugu questions asked on this site, but I haven't found an answer for this:\nMy sysadmin locked my account on the server side, due to unexpected activity from my account.

Anyone else know what this is and how to prevent, disable, or correct it?\n\nA: What you're seeing is to be expected if your Mac is waking from what's called Safe Sleep.\nSafe Sleep is a protective measure used by your Mac to ensure any data stored in memory isn't lost when your Mac shuts down due to a flat battery.\nMy guess is that the reason this only started about four months ago is that either:\n\n\n*\n\n*the overall condition of your battery has changed\n\n*the power adapter has developed a fault\n\n*the way you leave your Mac at night has changed\n\n\nIn other words, for some reason, starting four months ago your battery is being drained to a level that data stored in your memory will be lost because your Mac is going to shutdown. So your Mac is going into Safe Mode to save all this data to your drive.\nWhen it wakes up, you'll see the grey screen and progress bar that appears after Safe Sleep.\nYou can read more info from this Apple support article.\nNow, in your question you state:\n\nBattery fully charged and still in good shape. Laptop is pretty much always plugged in.

It appears in Google calendar just fine. In the calendar settings I can see the iCal URL, but when I attempt to subscribe to that address in Apple Calendar, it says \"A calendar wasn't found on ... Check the URL.\".\nI suspect this is because the calendar is shared with my via my Google account, rather than been made public. Is there anyway to sync the calendar with my Apple devices? Can I re-share it from my Google account so I can subscribe to it from iCloud?\nI tried the syncselect option, which sounded promising, but couldn't see anything happen. I'm not sure how it would work anyway, since I can't see how it would have access to my iCloud account.\n\nA: Inadvertently found a lovely solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences->Internet Accounts\n\n*Add or select your Google account\n\n*Click the checkbox next to \"Calendars\"\n\n\nVoila, all my Google Calendar calendars appear in Apple Calendar, including the one shared with me. Didn't think there was going to be a solution to this, but so simple once you know.\n\nA: This worked partially.  I found one additional step I needed to do:  the account shared with me is a \"delegated\" account.  So I had to go into Calendar Preferences, Accounts, and click on the delegates tab for my google account - and make sure the delegated accounts I want to subscribe to are checked.\n\nA: There are two methods:\nMethod 1:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you open the link of the calendar shared with you. You could click the plus sign at the right corner to add it into your own google calendar.\n\n\n*Go to https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect and check the calendar shared with you.\n\n*Go to the Mac Calendar and you will find it in your calendar list just under your google account. Check it for display.\n\n\nMethod 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*As step 1 in Method 1.\n\n*Go to the Google Calendar and the shared calendar appears in the \"Other calendars\", go to the setting of the shared calendar.\n\n*Scroll down and find the \"Integrate calendar->public address in iCal format\" and copy the address.\n\n*Open the Mac Calendar and go to \"Files -> New Calendar Subscription\" and paste the address into the \"Calendar URL\".\n\n\nHope this would work.\n\nA: In @Song WANG's answer, you can use the secret iCal URL in Google Calendar.

Sometimes this is accompanied by mouse cursor blinking between rapidly between different cursor shape, in a certain point which allows drag&drop (only/especially when drag is started); then the mouse pointer becomes \"stuck\" as if moving in dense syrup, for a few seconds/pixels. But this happens as well when not drag&dropping as well. \n Though, the effect is weaker (though still negatively affects productivity).\nAn extreme case is when doing native HTML5 drag in Chrome...\nPlease note: this is not about scrolling (unlike some questions which seem similar).\nMacBook Pro Retina 13\", late 2013. Two external DisplayPort monitors.\nIf this could be blamed on an app (as opposed to macOS sierra itself), then which kinds of apps would have such power to intercept and affect mouse-move events?\nPersonally in my multiple decades of computing, I've never seen mouse-move being affected in such a way. Usually the mouse was moving the way it should...\nTried Safe Mode (holding shift while booting), but it completely fails to load (progress bar stuck at 100%)...\nTime for a new macbook? Or time to go to Windows? :)\nThis is ruining my productivity (mouse moving at random speeds, sometimes 2-10 times slower).\nThanks for any hints!\nDoes affect magic mouse 2 and logitech usb-cable mouse.\nProblem does not seem to happen on MacBook's touchpad.\n\nA: I just found this because I had the same problem. I noticed that the cursor would come to a crawl whenever I hovered across a list of links on a website. The culprit: I had my mouse cursor set to a larger size. \nSolution: Go to System Preferences › Accessibility › Display, and set the cursor size to Normal (all the way to the left). After restarting Safari, the problem was gone. I can move across a list of links, the cursor switches between arrow and hand, without lag.\n\nA: Since you can't seem to boot into Safe Mode, I would try either (or both) resetting the NVRAM and trashing the Magic Mouse .plist files.\nResetting the NVRAM\nYour Mac uses Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). \nHere’s how to rest it on your model MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nTrash Magic Mouse .plist files\nSince your issue persists both in and out of Safe Mode, I would trash the relevant Magic Mouse preference files.\nAs you don't specify what version of macOS you're using, I'll assume you're running a version from Mountain Lion and above. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder\n\n*Press and hold the option key\n\n*While keeping the option key down, click on the Go menu and select Library from the list\n\n*This should open up your user's Library folder in a new Finder window\n\n*Locate and open the Preferences folder (it's within the Library folder)\n\n*Within this folder find the following two .plist files:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.AppleMultitouchMouse.plist\n\n*com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist\n\n\n*Now Trash these files\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n\nYour Mac will now create a new set of default preference files for your Magic Mouse. \nNote: You will need to go back to System Preferences and reconfigure your Magic Mouse settings. However, before doing that I would test the Magic Mouse first to see if the problem behaviour still persists.\n[EDIT - following successful Safe Mode boot]\nSince you've now been able to boot into Safe Mode and the problem wasn't present, the first thing to do is to startup normally and see if the problem is still there. Sometimes just the act of booting into Safe Mode will resolve the issue.\nIf the problem is still there, the first thing I'd check is your login items. Login items can be incompatible sometimes with other software/hardware.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on Users & Groups\n\n*In the lefthand pane, select your user name\n\n*Now select the Login Items tab (near top right)\n\n*Take a screenshot of the list that appears (ShiftCommand4 and select the list with your mouse cursor) or just write down the list\n\n*Now click on the first item in the list so it's highlighted (i.e. click on the name, not the checkbox)\n\n*Press and hold the Shift key while you click on the last item in the list\n\n*All items should be selected now. \n\n*Let go of the Shift key\n\n*Click on the minus - button (at the bottom) to remove all items\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n\nOnce your Mac has booted up, test to see if your mouse is now working properly:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your mouse works fine, then start to add the items back one by one (using your list or screenshot). However, only add one item at a time and restart your Mac after each one. This process will help you identify which item was causing your mouse problems. Once you know which item it is, then remove that again from your Login Items.\n\n*If your mouse doesn't work fine, let us know.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and rebooted my computer which did not help. \nIt turned out when I turned off my Thunderbird email application, the sticking went.\nSo it appears this is what is causing the issue. \nMy Thunderbird email application has over 20,000 messages so it may be causing a memory issue.\nSo turn off applications to try and identify the application.\nHope this helps you.\n\nA: I've been having the same problem for a while now. I've tried different mice, bluetooth and dongle, changing batteries, using a wired mouse, etc. After each change it seemed to get marginally better for a little while and then went back to awful. Moving the cursor by using the track pad sometimes seemed to unstick it, but that is not a viable option -- that's why I'm using a mouse. Last night the wired mouse seemed to be the solution, and today the problem was back.\nGoogle searching lead me to this page so I tried the \"reset the cursor size to default\" trick, while I have this web page open. I had a difficult time getting the mouse to go down to the Settings icon in the Dock to make the change, it kept sticking.\nI searched Settings for \"Cursor\", opened Accessibility, again with more sticking, made the change, and instantly my mouse started behaving properly. Not a single glitch in now almost 10 minutes of testing, where previously it was glitching every few seconds.\nI really don't like the default, tiny cursor on my large monitor, but at least the Shake Mouse option still works to help me find it on the screen.\nThanks for your help in getting me unstuck. Maybe I don't need to retire my bluetooth mouse.\n\nA: For me, removing all type-c charging cables works.\n\nA: This started happening to me yesterday with my mouse + RF dongle.\nI tried changing cursor size back to normal, moving the mouse's RF dongle to another port on the hub. No, still stuttering and dragging.\nAnd how did I fix this?

I contacted Apple Support with the problem soon after I made this post. Two weeks and many hours of phone and chat support later, we seem to have found an answer. The problem appears to have been with the indexing at the root level (which is why reindexing from System Preferences didn't work), likely caused by the macOS 10.12.4 software update. The solution was simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable all backups (Time Machine, Carbon Copy Cloner, or similar)\n\n*Open the terminal app and execute these three commands in this order:\nsudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/Server\\ RAID/\nsudo mdutil -E /Volumes/Server\\ RAID/\nsudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/Server\\ RAID/\nFollowing this, the mds and mdworker processes get right to work reindexing (spotlight shows reindexing progress).\n", "Q: Unable to enter safe mode.

I can only assume that somehow the host key capturing done by the virtualbox machines wasn't correctly returned on application minimization and that by closing the running virtual machines the host key (command) was returned to the host (mac) os.  \nThat makes more sense for the built in host key (command) shortcuts but the custom shortcut that had stopped working only when the finder menu was displayed doesn't use the hostkey.  It was ctrl-shift-f15 and why it was only not working when the finder menu was visible is also really odd.  The built in shortcuts completely stopped working - though the spotlight search icon from the menu tray continued to function properly.   \nI would have tried logging out and back in or rebooting if I had suspected that this shortcut had previously worked when the finder menu was active but due to my relative recent switch over to mac I didn't notice that it stopped working - only that it wasn't working.\nThanks for all the help and suggestions on this issue!\n", "Q: How can I neglect a update in App Store?

It says \n\nWhich devices can be enrolled in DEP?\nAny Apple Mac or iOS devices purchased on or after March 1, 2011 can\n  be enrolled in DEP. Mac or iOS devices purchased from participating\n  Apple Authorized resellers or carriers must be added to your DEP\n  instance to be included. All iOS devices must use iOS 7 or later, and\n  all Mac computers must have OS X Mavericks v10.9 or later. Once\n  configured, automatic enrollment in MDM occurs at the time of device\n  activation if a profile has been assigned. If a device has already\n  been deployed (activated), you can trigger automatic MDM enrollment by\n  erasing and restoring the device.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*what are the consequences of allowing DEP, and is it reversible?\n\n\n\nDEP supervises and enrolls the device into your Meraki MDM. Any\n  configuration profiles are going to come from Meraki, not DEP. If\n  there are configuration profiles that you want to remove, make the\n  change in Meraki... either remove the device from the \"Clients in\n  scope\" list under the profile, or remove the profile completely from >Meraki (if you don't want it on any device).\nDEP allows for the changing of the following: App Lock (Single App Mode)\nGlobal HTTP Proxy\nActivation Lock Bypass\nAutonomous Single App Mode\nWeb Content Filter\nSet background & lock screen\nSilent App Push\nAlways-On VPN\nAllow managed app installation exclusively\nAdditionally, you can block/disallow:\niBookstore\niMessages\nGame center\nAirDrop\nAirPlay\nHost pairing\nCloud Sync\nSpotlight internet results\nHandoff\nErase\nRestrictions UI\nInstallation of configuration profiles by UI\nNews\nKeyboard shortcuts\nPasscode modifications\nDevice name changes\nWallpaper changes\nAutomatic app downloads\nChanges to enterprise app trust\nApple Music\nMail Drop\n\n\n\n*how to contact the person who has DEP and ask them to remove it from the program?\n\n\n\nThe line under \"add to enrollment\" will tell you who is running the\n  DEP. You may see details by clicking add, and it will bring up\n  preferences. Under this, you may read (in plaintext) who is trying to\n  enroll you, and you may find out who it is.\n\n\n\n*When buying a new mac, how to know if it's on DEP? (the most important question)\n\n\n\nReset it. See if it bypasses Setup. \n\n\n\n*Someone on IRC said that if i was unable to authorize my machine from itunes then the machine is on DEP.. is this correct?\n\n\n\nYes. It would bypass this under MDM or under a DEP. \n\n\n\n*The same person on IRC says that there could be a previous owner, and this owner can format my computer and see all of my files even if i have my own icloud on it, is this correct?\n\n\n\nThis is true. \nThe Device Enrollment Program enables IT to easily leverage the\n  advanced capabilities of supervision without the need to physically\n  tether a device to a master computer running Apple Configurator –\n  supervision can be turned on with the click of a button OTA. IT also\n  benefits from the avoided risks associated with unmanaged devices.\n  With the Device Enrollment Program, IT can leverage un-removable MDM\n  profiles and even require devices to re-enroll after being wiped or\n  reset.\n\nBest of Luck!\n", "Q: Clear Terminal command history I'm trying to clear the history of commands that have been run on Terminal, I found an article which said I can do it with rm ~/.bash_history\nHowever, I am still able to see the previous commands that I've ran by pressing the up arrow\n\nA: Update 2022-05-05: For macOS 12 Monterey and above, you'll need to use this command to clear the Terminal history:\nrm ~/.zsh_history\n\nAlternatively, you can open your user folder in Finder, press Command + Shift + . to show all files, and manually drag the hidden .zsh_history file to the trash.\nYou might also want to check and clear the .zsh_sessions folder too, as it also might contain the history of previous Terminal sessions.\n\nA: An easy way to accomplish this is to close all terminal windows, and then open a single new terminal window, where you run:\nrm ~/.bash_history\n\nYou'll need to close the terminal and open it again.

You can set the schg flag using\nsudo chflags schg /etc/hosts\n\nRemoval of the protection depends on your kernel security level. Run sysctl kern.securelevel:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 means you need to boot to single-user mode to run chflags noschg /etc/hosts,\n\n*0 means you can simply sudo chflags noschg /etc/hosts.\n\n\n\nInstead of schg, you can use System Integrity Protection's restricted flag in El Capitan and later. You can boot to the Recovery HD to set the flag using chflags restricted /etc/hosts.\nThis protects the file from modification whilst SIP is enabled, which is enabled by default and can only be disabled by booting to the Recovery HD and running csrutil disable.\nCheck the status of SIP by running csrutil status: if it is enabled, any files with the restricted flag cannot be modified without disabling SIP from Recovery first or by installers signed with Apple's Software Update certificate (even root cannot modify the file).\n", "Q: commandline equivalent of PDF export with preview I have several PNG images that I intend to include in a LaTeX document, but it does horrible things to non-vector images.

Is the manual backup going to include health data now or do only automatic backups include those?\n\n\nA: Yes, since the check box is selected, the local backup is encrypted and includes your Health data.

But, whenever i tried to open a game ( far cry 2) it crashed. \nThings I've done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed direct x 9 . Didnt work\n\n*Installed every required .NET library and VC redistribution. Didn't work.\n\n\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: Just a little bit of research on Far Cry 2 we get the following:\nSystem Requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*2GB RAM\n\n*256MB VRAM\n\n*Windows XP 32bit\n\n\nYour MacBook Air came with either 4 or 8GB of RAM.  Regardless, if you are running Boot Camp with a 32bit version of Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, whatever), the most RAM you are going to be able to access is 3.5GB\nIntegrated Graphics:\nIntel HD 6000 uses up to 1.5GB of shared memory.  From Apple's website:\n\nApple computers using newer versions of Intel HD Graphics as the\n  primary GPU dynamically allocate up to 1.5 GB of system memory.\n\nSo, you are at a max of 2GB RAM.  Win10 requires a minimum of 1GB of RAM with 2GB recommended.  You're at the very edge of what the system calls for.  Additionally, it specifies Windows XP 32bit.  If you are running a 64bit OS, there's no telling how this will function, if at all and there's no compatibility statement that I could find with respect to Windows 10.\nHowever, from a discussion forum there's this little quote (re:  FC2 on MBA w/ HD3000):\n\nI can say with 100% certianty that a vid card like yours being intel\n  onboard junk will NOT run the game in any way. Infact i suggest\n  against buying anything made in the last 5 years and trying to play.\n\nand\n\nI highly doubt that. The only way to be sure is to try, but I think\n  you'd be wasting time and money.\n\nSo, you may get it to work in Boot Camp under Windows XP 32bit but because of the architecture of the MBA, it may not be worth the effort.  \n", "Q: iOS Spotlight search for, then edit a contact I can't for the life of me understand how, in iOS 10.3.1, I do what I've done many times before iOS 9/10, namely:\n\n\n*\n\n*Spotlight search for a contact\n\n*Then edit that contact\n\n\nThis is what I see:\n\nBest search hit\n\nCancel, Notes, Share Contact\nI.e. no way to edit nor to view it in the contacts app. I don't have 3D Touch. \n\nA: From your second screenshot, 3D Touch on the profile photo, then tap on the name at the top of the popup to open the contact in Contacts.app.\nWithout 3D Touch, this is not possible.

Does this have any truth to it? Is it possible to know how much longer I'll be able to install MacOS and XCode updates?\n\nA: There is no official timeframe that Apple hardware will support the latest operating system or versions of particular software. It will vary depending on the type of enhancements that occur in hardware and what impact this has in terms of what the latest software needs in order to be able to perform certain tasks.\nThe person who told you that Apple has an \"8 year support window\" may have been getting confused with Apple's policy on Vintage and obsolete products, but this relates only to hardware/parts support and has no implication in terms of the operating system and other software. \nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Vintage products are those that have not been manufactured for more than 5 and less than 7 years\n\n*Obsolete products are those that were discontinued more than 7 years ago.\n\n\nHowever, even the above will have some exceptions depending on local laws.\nUsing macOS Sierra as a guide, it is officially supported on:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac: Late 2009 or newer\n\n*MacBook and MacBook Retina: Late 2009 or newer\n\n*MacBook Pro: Mid 2010 or newer\n\n*MacBook Air: Late 2010 or newer\n\n*Mac mini: Mid 2010 or newer\n\n*Mac Pro: Mid 2010 or newer\n\n\nSource: Apple\nAs you can see, in some cases support goes back to 2009 models, while in others it goes back to 2010 models.

I am working with dnsmasq 2.77 installed via Homebrew, and macOS 10.12.5. I had 29,000+ hosts defined in /etc/hosts, which was fine until some point - upgrading macOS or dnsmasq, perhaps.\nI made a backup of /etc/hosts and then removed all lines from the hosts file except as follows.\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n::1             localhost\n\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n\nAfter trying it with the minimal hosts file, I found dnsmasq working.\nps aux | grep dnsmasq\nsudo lsof -n -i4TCP:53 | grep 'LISTEN'\n\nBut I didn't lose the definitions of hosts to block.

I'm thinking of making my camera app free to download, and let users take 20 photos, after which a dialog pops up asking for a (auto-renewing) subscription. If the user doesn't pay, the app will refuse to work. The user won't be able to take photos, or look at existing photos. The only thing in the app that will work is the payment UI.\nI'm looking to understand what functionality the app needs to have without an active subscription. I do intend to regularly update the app, as the guidelines say. \nThe goal is to let users see for themselves that the app is useful before I ask them to pay for it.\nWhere is this documented by Apple?\nI read the guidelines, and they don't say that apps are required to have any functionality if the user refuses to pay. Neither do they say the opposite, that apps like mine are okay.\n\nA: What you ask is exactly what happens in app review. If you are in a place to push a build for test flight review - you can get a preview of how the review team sees your app.\nAs long as the app is fully functional for the first 20 images, I would imagine you won't get rejected if that's the only issues the reviewer identifies. You could be in thin ice if your app simply monetizes the camera functionality - if an app seeks to make money on what the OS provides, that's grounds for a quick reject.\nYou can and should have one team member go over the App Review Guidelines. Have them pretend to be picky and seek to reject the app for each of the items. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/\nIf you are overwhelmed by the amount of guidance - start with the snapshot of common rejection reasons and run through the comic book version of the review guidelines - those highlight the most common and broad issues with app review. Once you're clear of those hurdles - a more detailed review might be good.\nNothing compares to submitting your app for review, though. Also - think of review as a 3 to 6 month process where you get to know the team and they get to know your app. The App Store is big enough now that coding for a weekend or week and then submitting for sale next week or next month is a rare event. All of those class of apps have well explored by thousands of people by now.\nI doubt Apple will ever come out and say precisely what is too little functionality. That binds them and their review team. What works for the first app doesn't work for the 100th app in category. There will be gray areas and you certainly are in it. If you have an app that refuses to work at all once the trial is over, my guess is you will be rejected. I could be wrong, but if that happens you could always let the free portion be free forever (the first 20 snaps or whatever) and only lock down people that need a subscription to run it.\nI've seen that work very well with low rejection rates - you are clear you need a subscription in that case, so Apple doesn't have to reject your app knowing it might cause some users heartburn if they don't realize what's paid and what's free. Best of luck with your app!\n", "Q: Increasing height of 27\" iMac I struggle with my 27\" iMac, with its fixed size and weight, to have it sit at a comfortable eye sight position for me when I look down at my screen. \nIf your neck aches because the monitor is too high, a few recommendations are available here and on macrumors. I'm soliciting a solution for the opposite problem dismissing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drilling holes to introduce VESA compatibility.\n\n*Introducing a clash with the fine lines of the iMac by putting it on top of one or a few books or reams of paper.\n\n*Getting an absurd-looking box to solve a problem that was contrived in the first place.\n\n\nIs there another method to make the 27\" iMac ergonomic for someone a bit taller than average who does not wish to keep his head dangling over his body while looking down at the monitor?\n\nA: We can separate the possible solutions into intrinsic and extrinsic solutions, as well as sitting/standing solutions.\nIntrinsic solutions (ones that will not look like an afterthought):\n\n\n*\n\n*You can \"[b]uy [an] iMac with Built-in VESA Mount Adapter\". You will not see this option on the usual checkout lane, but Google locates it.\n\n\nThe 27\" iMac weighs 21 pounds (9.54 kg). This could make it challenging to couple it with some random monitor arm on the market.\nExtrinsic solutions (an additional base with a potentially jarring look):\n\n\n*\n\n*Rain Design mBase Stand for 27\" iMac, $69.95\n\n*Bretford MobilePro Desk Mount, $179.95\n\n*A custom solution that matches the desk rather than the iMac.\n\n*Satechi produces a plastic and an aluminum stand. They're not adjustable, but breakage is less of an issue than with glass.\n\n*Fitueyes clear Computer Monitor Riser 4.7\" (thanks, Allan)\n\n*Halter Acrylic Monitor Stand / Monitor Riser 3.675\"H\nThe trouble here may be that you're designing a desk for just one person. If you are pursuing a more fluid ambiance at an office and wish to accommodate someone ranging from, say, 5ft to 6ft 2\", the presence of a base may not be too convenient.\nSit/stand solutions\n\n\n*\n\n*Ikea sells a manual and an electric adjustable desk. They are sitting/standing desks, and so they are a much more general solution for problems in ergonomics. To use while sitting, you will need to look for a really deep keyboard tray (or possibly get a second lower table to position underneath, if you won't find that setup particularly jarring).\n\n*Ergotron WorkFit-A, Sit-Stand Workstation, $595\n\n*Varidesk standing desk Pro Plus, $395 to $595.\n\n\nNote that neither the Ergotron nor the Varidesk solve the problem since the height difference between the keyboard and the monitor platform is constant. A monitor pedestal will still be needed.\nTo conclude, your best bet may be to look for a sit/stand desk (google/bing) and hook an adjustable keyboard tray (google/bing) underneath. Unfortunately that's not a cheap option.\n\nA: This looks promising: http://www.imacmount.com/order.html\nIt was the first thing that came up when I googled it, but I'm sure there are other similar options as well. Good luck.\n", "Q: Terminal gives :command not found, when typing too fast I'm having the weirdest problem on my new MacBook pro, I had the same on the old one and I thought it might have something to do with that.\nOn my old MacBook Pro, whenever I used the pipe char in my Terminal followed by, let's say, grep I'd get a command not found.  If I then just typed grep in plain in the Terminal I'd get the standard output.\nLater I discovered that the problem only occurred when I typed in the command fast:\nLets say I wanted to use tee to inherit something in a few text files.  From another Terminal I'd do:\n\necho \"-r base.txt\" | tee -a development.txt texting.txt production.txt\n\nI know this command and I'm able to type it all in ~3 seconds.  It gives me:\n\n-bash:  tee: command not found\n\nNow if I try the exact same command but really take my time typing it, lets say I use 20 seconds on typing it, then I get:\n-r base.txt\n\nThis is a confirmation that the command was executed properly.\nI believed something was wrong with my old MacBook. Four months ago when I bought a new Mac it was exactly the same.\nI then tried to do a fresh install. I deleted the hard drive and installed macOS from scratch. The same thing still occurs.\nHas anyone else experienced this problem? If so, do you have a fix?\nI also tried to install another Terminal like iTerminal2, I think that's what it's called, but with the exact same problem\n\nA: Your problem is actually not Terminal.app specific.\nThe problem is more caused by you being slow on the keys than fast actually. When you type the | (pipe) character you need to hold down the Alt-key. When you're typing fast, you're actually too slow in releasing the Alt-key.\nThis means that you're not actually typing a space before the next command. You're pressing Alt-Space which gives you a \"non-breaking space\" - which is not the same as a space, but it looks that way in the Terminal.\nThe \"non-breaking\" space is not seen by your shell as a command delimiter, but instead a part of a command or file name. And therefore you get the error that no such file or directory exists.\nTo solve the problem - just remember to lift your finger from the alt key before typing space.\nAlternatively you can change your keyboard mapping so that Alt-Space produces an ordinary space. You can find a guide to doing that here:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/78245/how-to-disable-the-option-space-key-combination-for-non-breaking-spaces\n", "Q: Is there a quick way to “flatten” an image in iOS I use the ‘markup’ extension in iOS Photos to ‘black out’ sensitive information in screenshots, occasionally. Unfortunately, this leaves the “revert” button, meaning that said sensitive information is sitting archived in my iCloud Photos indefinitely.\nI've got the messy solution of texting myself the modified image, deleting the original, deleting it again from Recently Deleted Photos, and then re-saving it from the text-message I sent myself … but that's no fun.\nWhat's the quickest way to turn a modified photo into a flattened copy of itself?\n\nA: One way to do it natively is to save the photo to your Files (tap the Share icon, then scroll to Save to Files). Then go into the Files app, find the image, tap the Share icon there and tap Save Image.\nThis will copy the flattened file back to your Photos. Unfortunately, it looks like you lose some meta-data, but it's the best option I've found.\n\nA: The best way I've found is to use Adobe Darkroom iOS app. You can view and edit photos from your regular albums, then export them to a flat file. Export to a new file, then delete the original via Darkroom. (I just checked, and realized I've been choosing the wrong option, 'modify original' - the details there say the image is still editable...damn). I just tested and in Darkroom I see markups made in the iOS photos app.\nI wish apple would make a 'flatten' option! I'd love an app that flattens all edited photos before I export to windows.\n\nA: The quickest way I've found to flatten an image edited with Markup is to take a screenshot of the edited image and then crop it.\n", "Q: Can I use an iPod nano 8g as a flash drive for windows, and still use it to play the music I paste in that drive?

Let's say I installed an app from the App Store, and my Apple ID is johndoe@gmail.com. Is it technically possible for the app developer (a random person, not an app developed by Apple) to see information such as:\nApp installed by johndoe@gmail.com 24 April 2015 at 12:05 PM\nApp uninstalled by johndoe@gmail.com 20 December 2016 at 2:08 PM\nApp reinstalled by johndoe@gmail.com 15 February 2017 at 5:53 PM\nOr is gathering information on which Apple IDs installed your app blocked by iOS? (I use iOS 10.3.1 on iPhone 6).\nFurther, if I deleted an app (for example, a game), and reinstall it, will the app be able to infer that I had installed it before (assuming my dynamic IP has changed because I turned Airplane mode on and off (I use mobile internet), that I reset the Advertising ID under Settings-->Privacy-->Advertising, and no other apps by that developer are also installed on my device)?\nThanks!\nPS - Sources for any answers you give would be much appreciated!\n\nA: No, apps can't see your Apple ID unless you allow it. Pro Tip: use a unique email address for your Apple ID, that you use for no other purpose. Also use unique email addresses for each app or service that you don't completely trust (i.e., all of them).\n\nBy default, developers don’t have access to your Apple ID, just a unique identifier. If you give your permission, developers can use your email to let others find you in their app. You’re always in control of these permissions and you can turn them on or off at any time. Your data isn’t shared with developers, unless you choose to share or post publicly.\n\nOur Approach to Privacy\nYes, it is technically possible for apps to know that you previously had their app installed. This was the cause of the recent Uber controversy:\nUber responds to report that it tracked devices after its app was deleted\nUnfortunately, it's very difficult for users to prevent this. At the least, from what I've been able to determine, you'd have to not use iCloud Keychain to share data across devices, and you'd have to factory wipe your phone and NOT restore it from a backup.\nSee also:\nWhat unique fingerprinting information can an iOS 10 app collect?\n", "Q: MacOS SFTP Public Key Authentication We can enable SFTP on our MacOS by going into System Preferences -> Sharing -> Remote Login\nThis works fine and we can easily connect to our local server by sftp localhost and then provide the password of the current user.\nNow, some professional FTP Servers, allow you to connect to the FTP server by using a SSH key.

I switched to a VPN port in that foreign country and mail \"sent\" fine!\n\nA: Delete Gmail account, force re-start iphone, TURN OFF WIFI, add account using cellular. Worked for me.\n\nA: I ran into this issue. The problem was that I previously blocked data for apple's Mail app. The error message isn't really clear that this is the case.\nTo fix it, head to Settings > Cellular. Wait for the list to populate, then find the Mail app and tick it so the radio button is green / enabled.\n\nA: I had the same thing happen to a co-worker just this morning, taking a closer look at the emails stuck in his outbox I noticed that one of the recipients was \":)\" and a cc was \"@3@.\"\nDeleted the odd recipient and cc, then sent again, once that one was sent the other emails in the outbox went too.\n\nA: Try opening Gmail in the server, out of the app if it happened in-app. So log in to Gmail in the server, not in an app then try to send again. Or it could just be a temporary issue that may resolve itself in a matter of minutes\n\nA: Just simply restart your iOS device. It will work.\n\nA: I just restarted phone and it worked\n", "Q: Use Homebrew LLVM over Xcode I'm trying to compile an algorithm package received by someone else. Basically all I need to do is run a bash script and everything will be compiled automatically. Now upon executing the script, I get a lot of errors, such as:\nclang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'\n\nMy understanding is that the Apple LLVM does not support OpenMPI, so what I did is install the newest gcc version by installing LLVM (version 4.0) through Homebrew. I tried to add this to my bash profile by adding the following (found on the web – my apologies, this isn't my home terrain):\n# export PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH\n# export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$(llvm-config --includedir):$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH \n# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(llvm-config --libdir):$LD_LIBRARY_PATH \n\nBut this unfortunately didn't do the trick.

I can't use another installer by specifying the version, since it's a long bash script, and I wouldn't know what to change where. \n\nA: You change the script - or better use a build system makefile, cmake, waf etc to have the full path to the C++ compiler and not rely on the $PATH.\nAlternatively see of the package has been ported to Homebrew and use that or if only to fink or MAcPorts see how they changed the script.\nLastly make the build as a Homebrew formula making use of Homebrew's own build tools\n\nA: Didn't think carefully about it, but did you try to \"brew link --force\" LLVM?\nCheck the current compilers, e.g. \niMac:~ sir$ which gcc-6\n/usr/local/bin/gcc-6\niMac:~ sir$ which gcc\n/usr/bin/gcc\n\nthen, do e.g.\nln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc-6 /usr/bin/gcc\n\nyou might have to sudo.\n", "Q: How do I change iPhone language to Lithuanian? I was asked to translate my iOS app to Lithuanian language. I did it, but now I would like to see the result, and...\ncannot change language of my iPhone to Lithuanian. Why?\n\nThere is no such lanaguage on my list, and I am confused.\n\nA: My understanding is that Lithuanian is not one of the 31 languages supported natively by iOS.

Type \"mail\" into the search field at the top of the screen. if the mail.app does not show up you may have accidentally deleted it. This is also an easy fix.\nGo into the App Store, tap on search and type \"mail app\" look for the familiar icon and make sure the developer is \"Apple.\" You can then \"re-install the app like you would any other. There will be no charge to do this.

Yet simply deleting the app, installing 3rd party \"cleaning\" software or any attempts to delete it via the terminal remain unsuccessful. I found out that since Mac OS 10.11 apple features so called 'System Integrity Protection', that basically forbidds its users to modify or uninstall 'system relevant applications'.\nSo how can I remove a pre-installed application on such a system?\nPS: I already know that this may be a bad idea in regard of future upgrades. Nevertheless let's just assume I'm willing to take the risk and am just looking for ways to get this done.\n\nA: You technically can remove Safari by weakening your system's security protections and disabling SIP.\nAgain: Do not do it!\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot on the recovery partition (hold cmd-R while rebooting until the Apple logo appears)\n\n*Open the Terminal from the Utilities menu\n\n*Type csrutil disable\n\n*Reboot\n\n*You should now able to remove Safari (if the Finder does not let you do it, use the Terminal and type sudo rm -fr /Applications/Safari.app)\n\n*I'd highly recommend you reactivate SIP then by rebooting and typing csrutil enable (it won't reinstall Safari)\n\n\nA: If you must disable SIP within macOS Sierra, here are the steps involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup (or restart) your Mac\n\n*Immediately hold down the commandR keys to boot into recovery\n\n*Click the Utilities menu and select Terminal\n\n*Type csrutil disable and press return\n\n*Close the Terminal app\n\n*Select Restart.... from the  menu\n\n\nNOTE\n\n\n*\n\n*I really do not recommend you keep SIP disabled.

I don't see any other advantages of TouchBar xD. So emoji enabled only in certain apple apps.\nI know, that it's app support story, but what about browsers? I want, for example, to use emoji in Facebook chat, or other web based chats in Chrome.\n\nA: Does the Touch Bar support emoji for every field?\nYes.  The touch bar will support practically anything the developer wants to include.  The more appropriate question is, can you enable it?\nNot unless the developer of the app allows you to.\nThe Touch Bar is an extension of the UI and is meant as another interface that the developer can utilize the enhance the experience.  See About The Touch Bar.\nSo, from the same document, you can see that emogis are available via the character picker but that character picker won't be available in the App unless the App developer enables it.\n \n", "Q: Mounting a Network share on login (There was a problem connecting to this server) I have a new piece of software that I've installed that relies on a mounted network share in order to operate. The network share is a hosted MacMini Server, connecting over SMB.\nI've added the share to the user's login items, but whenever the computer boots and is logged in, I see the (There was a problem connecting to the server \"MacMini\") and it doesn't mount.\nHowever, if I simply acknowledge that message, then do Command+K and mount it manually, it will mount without issue.\nI've already saved the credentials to KeyChain, I'm just not sure why it wont mount at login.\nIf anyone has any ideas. Much appreciated.\n\nA: I've been struggling with it for a couple of days myself, and finally found a solution. \nIn Automator, I made a simple three step Application that waits for a few seconds (using \"Pause\") before trying to connect to the network share. I believe the problem is related to the (in my case wireless) network connection not being completely established when the login items run immediately after login.\nThe Application consists of three steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Pause for 5 seconds\n\n*Get specified Servers \"smb://HOSTNAME/SHARENAME\"\n\n*Connect to Servers\n\n\nHOSTNAME and SHARENAME should be replaced with your own parameters. The choice of 5 seconds is arbitrary (and probably is likely dependent on one's own specific conditions) but it works on my own Mac Mini 2011. \n\nPlease note that running this script only works when the network share is not already connected, you need to unmount before running the application for testing purposes.\nUpdate: Now that I've had a few days of experience with this script I've found that it works sometimes and sometimes not, my guess is still that the wireless network isn't ready to connect and that it fails because of that. The reasons why are unclear to say the least, increasing the Pause timer duration definitely helps though.\n", "Q: Startup disk only shows: Mac OS X Base System A 2010 Macbook Pro was dropped. It will not boot in recovery mode. when I boot from a USB with Mountain Lion on it I can see only: Disk 1 -> Mac OS OX Base System.\nI was hoping to get data off the drive.\nI have installed Mountain Lion on an External USB HDD and it will boot and run from that. In Disk Utility no other drive shows up. \nOnly when booting from the USB drive do I see: Disk 1 -> Mac OS Base System.\nThe only option is to \"Verify Disk\" and it checks ok. Repair Disk options are grayed out. \nWould something like DiskWarrior be recommended? \n\n\n\nA: /dev/disk0 (the USB installer disk) is the only physical disk visible here. The rest are all virtual disks of one sort or another -- /dev/disk1 (\"Mac OS Base System\") is a disk image mounted from the USB disk, and the rest are RAM disks used by the Recovery system.\nSince I don't see any sign of your internal drive, even at the /dev entry level, I'm pretty sure you have a hardware problem that nothing like DiskWarrior will be able to help with. The disk itself may be dead, or a cable torn, or a connector knocked loose. In any of these cases, the only chance you have to get data off is will involve opening up the computer, checking cables and connections, and maybe removing the HD. Recent Apple laptops are not very easy to work on, so you may not want to risk doing this yourself. If you want to try, there are guides at iFixit.com; if not, find a repair shop to do it for you.\nIf it's just a cable/connector problem, repairing it and getting your data back is pretty straightforward. If the drive itself is dead, you may have to send it to someone like DriveSavers for recovery (which is expensive).\n\nA: I plugged the original drive into my PC and its perfect. it also works fine as external USB 2.0 (slow) drive. so something is wrong with SATA interface onboard I guess. \nI have an extra SATA drive in the machine now, disk utility sees it, but would not see the original drive? go figure. Disk Utility is having a hard time with the new drive i'll post a picture. says it repairs and just gets stuck at \"repairing volume...1 Minute...\"\nI have ordered and external Firewire 800 enclosure to hold her for now. should work since USB 2.0 works.

How can I best mirror folders between all 3? \nEDIT - Mirroring folders is needed as the MacBook Pro is mobile and will need file access away from the internet. \n\nA: ChronoSync should be able to do what you want.  While they offer an older version that will run on 10.6.8, I would suggest that, instead, you run the latest version on your 10.12 system and use it to sync the files amongst all your systems.\n", "Q: Change all photo durations at once in iMovie 10.1.1 I'm doing a quick project in iMovie but it's anything less than quick!

I also have a second user which has admin privileges. I invoke the privileges of that \"admin user\", when admin privileges are necessary for my \"main\" user.\nI'm now considering logging in to iCloud with my standard Apple ID, with my \"admin\" user. The Apple ID is normally associated with my \"main\" user. What will be the system effects of connecting my admin user to that Apple ID? \nMore specifically, I'm wondering if that will create stuff on my computer that will take up disk space for the admin user, such as iCloud Drive? Is there a risk of conflating application settings of the main user and the admin user which are stored in iCloud? And from a security standpoint, is it advisable not to login to Apple ID with my admin user (which I created just to isolate admin privileges from systems that shouldn't have them)?\n\nA: If you turn on iCloud drive it will take up additional disk space, you can simply disable that part of iCloud to avoid that. Otherwise you will probably see a small amount of disk usage but nothing that will really affect your computer unless you're very low on available disk space.\nAs far as your other concerns I haven't actually tried this but I can't imagine you'd have any problems and if you were a client of mine I'd set it up for you. Think about how many people have 2 users or more users on their computer and share the same iCloud account. iCloud doesn't actually sync a lot of application settings and this would be no different than having two computers setup both with iCloud on them, which tons of people have without issue.\n", "Q: Unable to update third-party apps on macOS Sierra -- temp dir not writeable Since upgrading to macOS Sierra I can't update any thirdy-party app and have to uninstall/install updated app to keep it on the latest.

I know Apple takes additional security measures regarding folder permissions rather than chmod but being initially a Linux user, I'm not sure which are nor which steps should I take to solve this problem.\nI Tried following steps presented here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5275515?tstart=0 regarding home folder and tweaking for my issue, but it still persisted\n\nA: This indicates that the permissions on that folder have become corrupted, or were changed by some other process.  My suggestion would be to follow the directions in the link below, and reinstall Sierra from the Recovery Partition.  Doing so, should reset the permissions on that folder, which should then allow you to successfully run the installer.

We've been trying to figure out this issue for a long time, but haven't had any luck.  I have two examples of related issues.\nOur environment consists of an Apple server that has many user accounts on it (50+).  We have 20+ iMacs updated to Sierra 10.12.4 that users can log in to with these network accounts.  The issue we're having is that certain passwords are being saved to these accounts' \"Local Items\" keychain.\nFor example, if I type in a mail password for user Bill at Desk 7, it will save to the Local Items keychain.  Any time Bill sits at Desk 7, his mail will work without having to type in a password again.  But if Bill moves to Desk 8, we have to type in his password again.  With 50+ users at 20+ gets, that's 1000+ times we have to type in a password for someone.  Originally, this wasn't a problem...I believe prior to Yosemite, Mail saved and checked those passwords in the Login keychain, which travels with the user no matter what desk they log in at.  The Local Item keychain does not travel with the user; it is local based on what desk they sit at.\nWith Sierra, another app is saving to the Local Items keychain.  Our users have SSH-keys created for their some ssh logins.  Originally, these saved to the Login keychain, and now they save to Local Items.  Same problem.  We have to re-type in the passphrase tied to the SHH-key at every individual desk in order for their ssh accounts to log in automatically.\nSo I ask you, is there a better way to do this?  It would save us a lot of micro-management if there was.\n(New user, so if there is a better place to ask this, please let me know.)\n\nA: We were encountering the same issue. Although we did not have any SSH payloads for the users, we do have Apple Mail setup for them.\nAfter having a panic attack over the confusion wrought by this keychain change, I decided to use Profile Manager on the OD Server (ours is OSX) to configure the Apple Mail payloads (for individual users/ user-groups).\nI believe it's possible to configure SSH Payloads in this manner as well.

Is there any good advice for doing that on an iMac. And is there anything you would recommend to upgrade in a iMac 21\" mid 2011?\n\nA: Upgrades\nI'll address your upgrades in the order you presented....\n\n*\n\n*The iMacs from 2011 use the Intel Core i5 or i7 Sandy Bridge processors which support a maximum speed of 1333 Mhz.  (iMacs don't use the Core i7 Extreme which support 1600 MHz).    However, your particular iMac will support up to 32GB of RAM1.  My suggestion is to max out your memory.  I have used this exact 16GB kit from Crucial to upgrade my personal iMac (you will need two 16GB kits total).\n\n\n*Swapping out the SuperDrive for a optical bay drive caddy and making a fusion drive2 is an excellent idea.  I have done this exact thing in MacBook Pros with excellent results.  However, in the iMac, you will find a 3.5\" hard drive which I would swap out for an SSD and then install a laptop hard drive instead of the SSD in the optical bay caddy.\nIf you haven't changed out that hard drive, keep in mind, it's going on 6 years old now which means it near the end of it's useful life.  You are taking the time and effort to do this upgrade, now is an excellent time to address the drive before it fails on you.  What you can do is get a USB drive enclosure and turn it into a Time Machine back up drive.\nIf you need step-by-step directions on how to do this, ifixit.com has an excellent guide.\nMake a Time Machine Backup\nBefore doing any of this, do a Time Machine backup so that you have something to fall back on (and migrate your data from).\nDo a clean macOS install.\nDo a fresh install, don't restore from Time Machine.  Instead, use the Migration Assistant.  Doing a clean install will ensure that orphaned files and apps you no longer need is no longer \"floating\" around your system.\nBefore beginning your upgrade, it's a good idea to take inventory of the Apps you have and want and any custom settings.

Years ago, you could get away with running brew as root just by chowning brew to root, but they removed that feature. So in Homebrew 1.1.6, I used to edit /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/brew.sh to remove the root check (the one that said it's \"extremely dangerous\") so I could run brew as root.\nThe newer version of Homebrew still works with that but keeps reverting the brew.sh file back every time after I run brew, even if I chmod 500 it. I could write a script to change it then run brew automatically, but I'm not sure if this will always work and don't want to take chances. Has anyone found a different method to run Homebrew as root?\n\nA: After making your change to the script, try setting the immutable flag on brew.sh.\nchflags uchg /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/brew.sh\n\nI have not tested. As a general rule, I do not give root to applications whose developers are begging me not to.\n\nA: Typical users shouldn't do this, but you're not typical are you?\nTwo issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can't stop root. If you insist on using root, then root can overwrite brew.sh no matter what.\n\n*You can't stop brew, after all, you're talking about running brew.\nSo we'll work with that. Let's setup an alias to copy over brew.sh then run brew.\nalias brew='cp /<modified>/brew.sh /<actuall>/brew.sh; /usr/local/bin/brew'\n\n(Fix the paths to match your system).\nNow all you need to do is:\nsudo brew <arguments>\n\n(It'll become root, copy over brew.sh, then run brew as root with arguments, afterwards brew will overwrite brew.sh and you'll be ready to do it all over again)\nNote: You could put sudo into the alias too, but this way feels better because you'll be prompted for a password every time.\nTypically you can't use setuid (chmod u+s) to root on shell scripts, for security.

I suggest using a ps like this:\nps -wwwAxo pid,ppid,state,%mem,%cpu,command | grep -i coco\n\nOr grep the PID you discover from the syslog like this:\nps -wwwAxo pid,ppid,state,%mem,%cpu,command | grep 23430\n\nIf my hunch is correct, and it is under your login user's context that the service runs, then locate the offending plist in something like:\n/Users/[your login user's short name]/Library/LaunchAgents\n\nA quick-and-dirty method:\ngrep -r -i \"coco\" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/\n\nThis should identify the offending sneak.  If not, please let me know and we will then take the hunt to the next level.\n\nA: You may want to try the LaunchControl utility. It's free and will show all launchdaemons/agents, what they do, and let you disable/enable.  Very handy.\nhttp://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/\n", "Q: How to erase my iPhone photos completely?

I want to do following updates to it:\na. Processor update from i5 to i7. Upgrade cost = $300.\nb. RAM upgrade from 8 GB to 16 GB. Upgrade cost = $200.\nc. SSD upgrade from 128 GB to 512 GB. Upgrade cost = $400.\nFinal cost of MBP = $1299+$300+$200+$400=$2199.\npros-\na. performance wise it is similar to 2016 non-touch version.\nb. USB and other ports are available.\ncons-\na. It is using 5th gen broadwell processor as compared with 2016 skylake processor.\nb. Since apple dicontinue product after 5 years, so if I purchase 2015 model now I have 2.5 only years before it is discontinued.\nAnd after that if any part need replacement I will not be able to do that even if it is under apple care after 2.5 years.\n2nd choice- 2016 MBP 13 inch non-touch bar version with price $1499. Similar upgrade as above for Processer, RAM and SSD. \nFinal cost of MBP = $1499+$300+$200+$200=$2199. After doing upgrades its price is similar to 2015 model with similar upgrades.\npros-\na. It is using skylake CPU.\ncons-\na. Ports are removed. I need to buy dongle.\nb. There is lot of negative reviews for 2016 model on internet.\n3. No magsafe.\n3rd choice- I have early 2011 13 inch model. I wanted to upgarde its RAM and SSD and use it instead of buying new MBP. But its battery cycle count is 1060 and since apple has discontiued \nthe product I can not get battery replaced with apple manufactured battery and I am not sure about non-apple battery if they will work or not.\nMy choice is 2015 model but main problem I see in that is it has only 2.5 years before it become discontinued and if I buy applecare after 1 year that will make product warranty 1+2=3 years but MBP time remaining for discontinue is 2.5 years. So 6 months apple care will be of no use.\n\nA: The crux of your question/decision seems to lie in the following assumption:\n\nSince Apple discontinue product after 5 years, so if I purchase 2015 model now I have 2.5 only years before it is discontinued. And after that if any part need replacement I will not be able to do that even if it is under apple care after 2.5 years.\n\nHowever, your assumption is wrong.\nI refer you to Apple's policy on Vintage and obsolete products, which outlines their hardware/parts support. \nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Vintage products are those that have not been manufactured for more than 5 and less than 7 years\n\n*Obsolete products are those that were discontinued more than 7 years ago.\n\n\nNote: Bold emphasis mine.\nIn essence, the 13-inch MacBook Pro (2015) model is still being manufactured and has not been discontinued yet. Apple's warranty provides global coverage, and if you purchase Apple Care then you will be covered for the whole of that Apple Care period.\n", "Q: Digital snow on external screens Macbook Pro 15\" 2016 + USB-C Adapter I have this new Macbook pro and this is what is going on after a while. Might be actually a heating issue since I run it in a clamshell mode. But since I can screenshot it I can assume this is a software problem. \n\n\nIt happens when two monitors are plugged in and I think especially after I scroll or open many windows.\nAfter you let it idle it goes back to normal I will check the GPU temperature next time. The strange part is I can screenshot the issue. So I guess that might be drivers fault? The OS is the latest one: Sierra 10.12.4 (16E195) with all updates installed.\nIt is probably not related to the temperature:\n\nAnd the hardware test did not find any defects.\nUPDATE\nAfter observing it, I think I could say that it happens only with external monitors connected through Apple USB-C -> USB/Lightning/HDMI adaptors.\nBut the problem is not in the adaptors or I wouldn't be able to screenshot it.\nUpdate\n\nA: This looks like a hardware GPU problem.  You can run diagnostics by booting the machine while holding D.  Instructions here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202731\nSince this is a pretty new computer I'm sure it will be repaired under warranty (new logic board).

I just 'lived' with it but now I changed to a new Mac with fresh OS and I've never experienced this issue since then.\nI suggest to recheck if all updates are installed. Maybe give us some thermal parameters just to be sure.\nI know this should more be a comment than an answer but I'd like to help, I was annoyed with this as well :-)\n\nA: I had a similar issue with a 2011 MacBook Pro, which turned out to be a known issue with the physical silicon of the graphics processor.  Apple can run the diagnostic for free if you make an appointment at a Genius bar, although they may charge for a fixed price repair if it turns out to be a hardware issue.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for \"replace\" on the dialog box Every time I need to overwrite files on my macOS Sierra Macbook when saving from a different location, I have to necessarily click on the Replace button.

I recently put a new SSD in, it is HFS+ Journaled and Encrypted. When I use Disk Utility's First Aid, it tells me, it needs to be repaired: \n \nThe problem is when I start in Recovery Mode, my SSD is encrypted so does not mount. When I click on it to mount it, the password box comes up, but the keyboard is not working at all. I have looked at other answers on the site but they seem to be for USB or wireless keyboards, not a laptop inbuilt keyboard.\nShort of totally unencrypting the drive, so that I don't have this keyboard mounting issue, then re-encrypting it, what can I do to get keyboard working in recovery mode / mount this drive so the OS can do these repairs?\n\nA: As a first step I would try resetting your NVRAM to see if that allows you to enter your password. It's unclear whether you'll be able to do this, since you need your keyboard to do so - but we actually don't know if the keyboard is the issue. In fact, since the USB keyboard didn't work, I suspect it's something else.\nReset NVRAM\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionPR keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nIf you don't hear your Mac reboot and play the startup chime again, then try the above steps from scratch, but try using the USB keyboard instead.\nLet me know how you go.\nUse Terminal in Recovery Mode to unlock your encrypted drive\nOkay, since resetting the NVRAM didn't change things I suspect that this may not be a keyboard issue, but something else related to entering the password. So let's test this theory by trying to unlock your volume via Terminal. \nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your Mac into Recovery Mode\n\n*Launch Terminal (Utilities > Terminal)\n\n*Enter the filling command in Terminal: diskutil list\n\n*Now, because you have an encrypted volume you should see something like this:\nLogical Volume DriveName on disk2s2\n123E4567-E89B-12D3-A456-426655440000\nLocked Encrypted\n\n\n*Now, to interpret the above example: DriveName will be the name of your drive, and the next line (i.e. the 123E4567-E89B-12D3-A456-426655440000 in my example) will be what is known as the universally unique identifier (UUID). This identifier will be a string of alphanumeric characters in a 8-4-4-4-12 format. The UUID is what you will need to unlock your encrypted drive.\n\n*Enter the following command in Terminal: diskutil coreStorage unlockVolume <uuid>\nNOTE: Replace the <uuid> with the actual UUID for your drive.\n\n*You should now be prompted for your password\n\n*Enter the password (don't worry if you don't see the cursor move)\n\n*Press enter\nNOTE: If you can't enter any commands in Terminal then we know the problem lies with your keyboard input. Either way, let me know how you go.\n\nA: I was able to resolve the problem of the keyboard not working in Recovery Mode by first reseting the System Management Controller as described in the following article: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\nAfter that was complete, when I booted into Recover Mode, I was able to use the keyboard. Also, the Utilities menu appeared in the menu bar after the the reset (before the reset, the only menu item was \"Language Chooser\" which had options).\n", "Q: Does macOS Sierra do mac address randomisation?

I think it reverts upon reboot though.\nThe command is sudo ifconfig <interface> ether <new mac address>\nFor example, sudo ifconfig en0 ether 12:34:56:12:34:56\nYou may need to toggle the interface as well sudo ifconfig en0 down and up\nAs per this site (https://blog.macsales.com/37428-tech-tip-finding-and-changing-your-mac-address-in-os-x) you can make a random MAC like this \nopenssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/.$//'\n\n", "Q: OS 10.11 Can't access photo library from Finder file upload box I'm running OX 10.11.6 and using the stock Photos app. Whenever I attempt to access the media browser from the Finder file upload box, such as when attaching a photo to an email or social media post, I am unable to access my library. The finder gets stuck in a loading state, forcing me to open the Photos app itself, drag the file to my desktop, and then attach it that way. It goes without saying that this manual approach is extremely cumbersome. \nHere's a screenshot of what I see when I try to access my photo library from the finder:\n\nNow I've read numerous posts on this same issue that suggest going to Photos > Preferences > General and checking if the photo library is the system default. This usually solves the problem for people, however I've already done that to no effect. See screenshot below:\n\nI've also tried rebooting my machine, repairing the photo library and then rebooting again, but to no avail. Upgrading my OS X install isn't an option for me because I'm on an older machine (2009 13\" MacBook Pro) that is no longer supported.\nIs there any way to remedy this issue that doesn't involve reinstalling OS X?\n\nA: I'm wondering if an application/bug/corrupted setting is causing this. We can test that by trying it on a completely blank slate by creating a new OS X account real quick. \nYou can do this over in Users, Systems & Groups in System Preferences. Create a new admin user account (no iCloud necessary) restart into the new account & test there, ideally with the same exact photos library.

My touch bar often shows the wrong keys, is unresponsive, or (as is the current situation) only shows one or some of the keys. Right now I'm listening to Spotify and only the pause button is showing whereas it usually has my normal configuration. I have hard-set it to a custom configuration which is almost identical to the keys before the touch bar came out.\nNote - I just started pressing all over the touch bar and the correct buttons came on in each area that I pressed.\nThis thing offers little value and causes lots of problems. I haven't played around with it much or done anything with my computer (i.e. fun/sketchy software) that is atypical. Are there common reasons for the new touch bar to break all the time?\n\nA: I'd imagine the Touch Bar can become buggy for the same reasons that any computer becomes buggy, so what you could do is use Touch Bar Simulator to see what your Touch Bar thinks it's displaying, thereby narrowing it down to if the issue is software or hardware. If it's software, try the usual stuff like disk repair and reinstalling macOS. If it's hardware, it may be time to visit an Apple Store...\n\nA: If it was me I'd reset both the NVRAM and SMC (in that order).

(w/o macOS Server app) First of all, I'm happy to pay the $19.99 for the Mac OS Server app from the app store, so that's no problem, it's just that at the moment I only have one specific need - NFS sharing between my macOS sierra host and a virtualbox VM guest running Debian Sarge (don't ask).\nThis is something I am used to doing in Linux without any difficulty, but the syntax for /etc/exports doesn't seem to be the same? In the man page for exports on macOS it uses explicit flags?\nMy regular line in /etc/exports on Linux:\n# NFS Share to Virtualbox guests:\n/path/to/my/shared/directory 192.168.56.0/24(rw,fsid=root,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check)\n\nCalling nfsd checkexports returns the following:\ngetaddrinfo() failed for 192.168.56.0/24(rw,fsid=root,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check)\nexports:2: couldn't get address for host: 192.168.56.0/24(rw,fsid=root,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check)\nexports:2: no valid hosts found for export\n\nAnd if I simplify and change the etc/exports entry to /path/to/my/shared/directory -network 192.168.56.0 -mask 255.255.255.0 I get the following output from nfsd checkexports:\nexports:2: path contains non-directory or non-existent components: /path/to/my/shared/directory\nexports:2: no usable directories in export entry and no fallback\n\nNote: /path/to/my/shared/directory is obviously a just a placeholder filepath for this question, not my actual entry in /etc/exports \nIs it just because the line in /etc/exports is crap, or I need some other configuration? or do I need the macOS Server app? \nFrom looking at https://help.apple.com/serverapp/mac/5.3/#/apd106E5632-C4E6-4572-8289-B9ACC652E88C it seems like it might not be anything I need the macOS Server app for?\nEDIT:\nWhat I want is the equivalent behaviour and rw permissions of rw,fsid=root,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check in my exporting, I've got it working with NFS Manager where I can mount the folder on my VM guest but read-only.\n\nA: macOS Server is not required at all to share directories over NFS. The macOS client provides all necessary tools.\nTesting various exports with bogus paths, I'd assume your path simply doesn't exist.\nThe most convenient GUI-tool for NFS is NFS Manager. You will be presented with a nag-screen launching it or changing configurations, but it works without further restrictions.\n\nMost of your desired options are available in macOS (check man exports) and can be configured with NFS Manager:\n\nSome details have to be configured in the advanced options (e.g. the access permissions).\n\nA: What was required was the following line in /etc/exports:\n/path/to/shared/dir -mapall=<uid of local user on host machine with correct perms> -network 192.168.56.0 -mask 255.255.255.0\n\nexports(5) is the FreeBSD version, obviously.

I have a 2017 13\" Macbook Pro.  Sadly, there are only 2 USB type C ports and 1 of them is for charging.  I need at least 1x USB and 1x Thunderbolt 2 (for external Monitor).  I bought a USB C -> Thunderbolt 2 adapter for $50 bucks...and honestly it feels like a complete rip off.  I'm hoping for a similar product at this price with more than 1 connection.\nBonus for a dock with a charging light.  The closest thing I've found has no Thunderbolt 2 and terrible reviews.  I'd like to at least obtain parity with my 2014 MBP before I consider keeping this laptop.\n\nA: I am basing my answer off this statement in your question: \n\nI need at least 1x USB and 1x Thunderbolt (for external Monitor)\n\nWhat you need is a USB-C Multi Port Adapter with Power Delivery.  This will connect via the USB-C port, give you an HDMI port for video, USB 3.0 ports for expansion and another USB-C port for charging.\nAs far as the adapter that you previously bought is concerned, you bought a \"Thunderbolt 2/3 converter.\"  What you needed was a Thunderbolt or USB to display (HDMI, DispayPort, VGA, etc.)\nIt's important to note that the ports on your MacBook are Thunderbolt 3 ports with USB-C connectors.

of elimination and usually requires some patience.\nTo start with I would boot your Mac into Safe Mode and determine if it still crashes.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. does it still crash while in Safe Mode)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Test again to see if it still crashes when booted normally\n\n\nOnce you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went and we'll go from there.\n\nA: Why not back up your files and erase install OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*If it doesn't crash - it was software.\n\n*If it does crash - it's hardware.\nIf it's software, bring back either a user folder or apps - test. Then bring back the other - test.\nMost of the time the clean install and then migrating back apps and settings and user data resolves panics that follow an update of the OS. More rarely, it's hardware in general. Most rarely, it's hardware connected and relating to the specific update.\n", "Q: Multi threaded CPU intensive task throttles CPU way before temperatures limits I have written a very CPU intensive threaded task that works as expected on my 2012 MacBook Pro quad core. I turn it loose with 20 threads and the temperatures get up to about 100 °C as measured with Intel Power Gadget with minimal throttling. \nTake the same program and data files home to my 2016 13\" MacBook Pro with a dual core machine and start it up, I would expect that it would also keep up the 3.3-3.4 GHz until the temperature gets near the 100 °C mark. Top command shows the task at 350% (2 cores each dual threaded), but the CPU frequency gets cut to 1.6-1-8 GHz with the temperature only at 60 °C or so with the fans dead quiet.  If I start 4 separate single threaded CPU tasks, the machine behaves as expected with it keeping up the 3.3-3.4 GHz until it hits the 100 °C and the fans get cranking.  The question is why is my CPU being throttled?  \nBoth machines are up to date and running the same versions of gcc. If I even take the binary from the working machine and put it on the 2016 Mac, it has the same problem.\nIf I run 3 or 4 CPU single threads so the machine is going at full speed, then start the threaded program, it slows the frequency down also.\nBoth machines have 16 GB of RAM.\nEdit\nAfter playing around with code, I suspect that it is getting throttled when a task creates too many threads. In this program, I take each record I read and create a thread for it. I only let 20 or so threads go at a time so at no time is there more than 21 threads, but there are 14,400,000 records to be processed so over the 30 minutes or so each of those records will be processed by a separate thread.\nI created a trivial pthread program that sucked CPU time and set 10 of them running. The problem laptop ran that and warmed up to 95C without issues.  \nI guess I will rewrite my code to reuse the same thread instead of destroying them and starting them up again.\nUpdate 5/13/17\nAfter several hours of work, it now only creates n threads and just reuses them, that didn't help.  Other than CPU temperature, what will cause this machine to throttle down?\n\nA: This may be a longshot, but perhaps the difference in single-core performance and/or cache performance between the 2012 and 2016 cpu packages are large enough that the cores are data-starved and throttling down until they are able to work again? \nI'm making that guess because you indicate enough single-thread processes can run full speed on all cores, and a simple multi-thread program can run full speed on all cores.\nThat makes me think there is something in the program design of your real workload vs the test multi-thread workload that isn't letting the CPUs work all the time\n\nA: The kernel extension /System/Library/Extensions/AppleACPIPlatform.kext controls a lot of temperature and CPU safeguards. It's already compiled, obviously, on your system, but it may be available on https://opensource.apple.com (I can't find it, but I only gave it a quick look). It wouldn't surprise me if Apple had very conservative settings on CPU capability.\n\nA: Whenever the os recognizes threads as unpredictable and out of control it will throttle down to remain hardware and system stability, the 2012 model behaves different and might lock up in worst case. Happened to me with poorly implemented thread control, my fault. Just dont run that many threads on an dual core.\n\nA: Happened to me with poorly implemented thread control, my fault. Just dont run too many threads on a dual core CPU.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Tuxera NTFS? I wanted to remove the NTFS support I installed using Tuxera NTFS.

All the cables inside are connected accordingly. NVRAM battery is checked (reinserted on it's place), resetting NVRAM didn't fix the problem. I'm out of ideas how to fix it. The latest try will be bringing it to repair shop.\n\nA: Based on what you described, you most likely have a logic board issue.\nThe SIL (Sleep Indicator Light) will normally come on and stay on until the GPU is initialized at which point the display turns on.\nFrom Apple Support:\n\nWhen you press the power button to turn on the computer, the SIL will also turn on. As the computer starts up, the SIL stays on until the processor (GPU) has initialized and the display turns on. When the GPU initializes properly, the display will turn on and the SIL will turn off simultaneously. \n\nIf you have a problem, the SIL will blink out a \"code\" which you can use for diagnostics.  Since it's shutting down, prior to an error code or a boot, the most likely cause is your logic board.\nIt's time to take it in for service.\n\nA: The symptoms looks like either Power Supply Unit failure or some sort of motherboard associated problem (e.g CPU failure).

When activating the mic to record audio, it seems that both the recording quality AND audio playback quality severely drops to a substandard level (Mono 8.0 kHz).\nFor example, if I invoke Siri on the Mac, whatever is being said and recorded by me, AND the Siri/Mac/AirPod audio  response will be in poor quality. After the recording is done, audio playback quality usually goes back to normal1. Any mic audio recorded to a file will however be in the poor quality; which is why I interpret the issue to affect both recording and playback qualities.\nThe issue appears to be identical to the one discussed in this Apple Support Forum thread. The thread offers possible explanations but no definitive solution or suggested course of action.\nI have this issue with several Macs of various recent models. I don't have this problem when using the AirPods with an iPhone.  I have tried resetting the Mac Bluetooth interface, tried resetting the AirPods, and so forth.\n\nFYI: Using the macOS native application Audio MIDI Setup, I attempted to observe what's happening when AirPod recording is activated. Output quality drops from the standard 2 ch 24-bit Integer 44.1 kHz → 1 ch 16-bit Integer 8.0 kHz.\n\n\n1It has happened that the Mac got permanently stuck in low quality until system reboot, or even whenever the AirPods were connected afterwards. I had to attempt AirPod unpair/re-pair, and even a charging case reset to fix the latter situation.\n\nA: I just created a little menu bar app that forces the default input to be the built-in microphone of the mac if exists, if not you can choose your desired default input source. No more sound quality drops and it also increases the battery life. It is free and open source:\nhttp://www.milgra.com/airpods-sound-quality-fixer.html\n\nA: This problem frustrates me to no end. Recently I noticed that when I start a Vagrant/VirtualBox VM (vagrant up), and it prompts me for administrator access (one time I remember it asked for access to the microphone, and I was a bit confused), the audio drops to the low bitrate connection.\nI always have my mic set to an external USB mic, and speakers set to AirPods, so it doesn't seem (in my case) to be related to the mic input being set to the AirPods.\nHowever, knowing that I can more easily see what's happening with the Audio MIDI Setup app, I opened it up, and sat there messing with some toggles a bunch of times, until I came up with the following process which set the audio back to the 32-bit 2 channel mode reliably without a full reboot!\n\n\n*\n\n*Have some audio playing (e.g. iTunes)\n\n*Open Audio MIDI Setup\n\n*Select your Airpods in the list of devices (the one with 1 out or 2 outs)\n\n*Toggle the 'Format' menu from \"1 ch 16-bit...\" to \"2 ch 32-bit...\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that this will blip the audio for a few ms, but it will switch back\n\n\n*Keep Audio MIDI Setup open\n\n*Disconnect your AirPods to your Mac using the Bluetooth menu\n\n*Re-connect your AirPods to your Mac using the Bluetooth menu\n\n*Wait for some playing audio to return to your AirPods—it will still be tinny and yucky sounding.\n\n*Quit Audio MIDI Setup.\n\n\nThis has worked two times for me; other times I tried restarting... just putting this out there in case it works for someone else!\n\nA: OP here – I'd just like to add to the answer below, that I've been in contact with Apple Support.\nExplanation\nApple claims that the poor Mono 8kHz quality which affects recording and indeed simultaneously playback on Mac when the AirPod microphones are activated, is because the SCO codec then gets employed over the entire Mac audio system. This is supposedly \"expected behaviour\" when trying to use the AirPods and other Bluetooth headsets together with a computer, according to Apple.\nThe AAC codec is normally used when just listening to playback on the AirPods. It's just very unfortunate that SCO – low-quality as it may be – upon AirPod microphone activation is not only limited to doing recording, but also displaces AAC and audio playback.\nApple Support claims that Apple is looking at this issue, and that improvements might be coming in future firmware updates, but I did not interpret that as a promise to be honest. But for the time being, I'd say that the benefits of making calls and so forth with AirPods on Macs are quite limited.\nCurrent best practice\nCurrent best practice is to use the Internal Microphone for Recording, and the AirPods for playback when conducting calls. Input and Output devices can be selected in System Settings > Sound or by ⌥-clicking the Volume icon in the macOS Menu Bar, and selecting devices there.\nSee the screenshots below:\n\n\n\nA: I've been getting crazy with this issue, because as it's described on every call with the iPhone everything was perfect, but not with the mac... which is not very convenient from apple...\nWell, I downloaded the \"Bluetooth Explorer\" from @Alex-Ruyven unofficial link and I tried to force APTx, and it's works partially...\nWhen listening to music, I see it's using the \"SBC\" ( APTx for apple ) code instead \"AAC\". And I hear a bit lower music quality for playback music.\nThe problem is as soon as we connect the microphone, it still changes the code to SCO so still the same problem from the beginning.\nReally hoping Apple fix it quickly because having a 100% Apple ecosystem and this issues on calls it's not the idea I got when I bought the AirPods.\nWell, hope to see an update soon.\n\nA: I found this on the Apple Discussion boards:\n\n... they are aware of the issues and a temporary workaround is to switch\n  the mic from the AirPods mic to the internal microphone.\n\nOn the discussion post you referenced, there was 217 other people reporting that they too had this issue.\nAlso from a May 6th Apple Tool Box article:\n\nMany of our readers are letting us know that their AirPods are\n  experiencing a lot of challenges while using them with macOS.  In\n  particular, when the mic is used, the AirPods’ audio is very low\n  fidelity and sound quality. Some iFolks claim that they cannot even\n  understand the other person when video-chatting with apps like\n  FaceTime, Hangouts, and Skype.  And your callers also report that your\n  voice sounds muddy or that they barely hear you at all.\n\nIs there a fix?\nOther than the workaround to use your internal mic, no.  My advice is to return the unit to Apple.   There may be a fix in a future update to macOS or the AirPod firmware, but only Apple knows when they will issue an update.  Given that Apple \"silently\" released the last update, don't expect too much fanfare with the next one.\nPersonally, I would have returned them and/or opened a support case with Apple as they are the best ones to solve this issue.  \nThis is not an issue with your \"bluetooth chip\" as per the comments.  This would be easy to diagnose - test you MBP with other BT headsets.  If the problem goes away, it's the AirPods.  \n\nA: The problem was: I had created an “Aggregate Device” in Audio MIDI Setup which included the AirPods as one of the in channels.\nBy using the AirPods mic this way, it forced the AirPods to use the SBC codec for its Bluetooth audio communication (which you can verify by option-clicking the Bluetooth menu and hovering over your AirPods device, and it will show you the RSSI levels and audio codec being used).\nThis meant terrible quality mono audio\nTo fix the issue, I simply removed the AirPods as an in channel from the Aggregate Device in Audio MIDI Setup.\nYou may also need to explicitly go into the AirPods out device in Audio MIDI Setup and configure the “Format” menu to be “2 ch 32-bit float (48.0 kHz)” instead of “1 ch 16-bit (8.0 kHz)”.\nNote: changing the format won’t work (it will blip back to “1 ch 16-bit (8.0 kHz)” if you have the AirPods in channels configured anywhere else in Audio MIDI setup).\nAfter doing this, the AirPods reverted to their high-quality stereo output.\n\nA: The workaround to this in the OP's answer is effective, except in one particular scenario I've come across.\nOnline meeting and conferencing software like Zoom can actually override the Mac system settings, so that when you change the settings in your Mac sound preferences, nothing actually happens, which is undoubtedly frustrating.\nThe fix is quite simple: go into your conferencing software (in my case Zoom) and change the mic source there. :)\nAirPods Pro aren't so pro after-all. Hope this helps someone!\n\nA: As the answer already states, it's because the AirPods change to the SCO codec. The bad news is, there is no way to permanently change this in macOS High Sierra¹ - there was a way to fix it in macOS Sierra, so if anyone reads this and hasn't yet updated, try this: \nUse Apple's developer tool Bluetooth Explorer. Then you can use Audio Options (under Tools in the menu bar) to force them to use the alternative codec aptX.\n\n\n*\n\n*Official download, if you're a member of Apple Developer:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/download/more/ (search for Additional Tools)\nThat's also where it states that it requires macOS Sierra.\n\n*Inofficial download, plus description with screenshots:\nhttp://www.theghostbit.com/2015/03/force-mac-os-x-to-use-aptx-with-your.html\nFull disclosure: Unfortunately I can't try it myself. (This is the first time I regret updating to the newest Apple OS...)\n¹ the temporary workaround from the other answer works, obviously, you just have to do it every time.\n\nA: Had this issue today, and I tried everything else in this thread and I couldn't get it working. After chatting with apple support (in the MacBook department, not the AirPods department).\nI had to delete some configuration files and then reset the NVRAM. Here are the files to delete:\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.soundpref.plist\n/Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist\n/Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.SystemSettings.plist\n\nThe first one wasn't present for me, but I deleted the other two. Then I reset the NVRAM following the instructions here.\nGood luck!\n\nA: An upgrade to macOS Monterey seems to improve the minimum sampling rate of both the input and the output of Airpods Pro from 8KHz to 24KHz.\n\nPersonally I have found that this level of quality is sufficient for voice calls, so the workaround using the built-in microphone is not needed anymore.\nI also find the quality equivalent to voice calls I make on my Android phone.\n", "Q: Connecting external displays over HDMI to 2016 MBP Touch Bar requires a restart Any time I connect my two external displays (Samsung S27D850 over HDMI -> A-Data HDMI-USB-C adapters), I have to restart my MacBook Pro Touch Bar (15\") in order for the screens to display the desktop. \nIs there a workaround not having to do this, i.e., just plugging the displays in and voilà? It's frustrating coming back from a meeting to my workstation and having to restart.\n\nA: I found a workaround for my setup with HDMI-USB-C-conversion: first plug the adapter to the computer, then the display cable to the adapter. Then the display works immediately.\nIf I plugged the monitor first into the adapter, it already \"gives a signal\" by showing a black screen instead of the \"no signal\" message. If I then connect the adapter to the computer with the monitor cable plugged into the adapter already, the display would detect, but the black screen would remain on the external display.\nNot perfect for workstation use, but for meeting room situations, it's acceptable.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro retina 2012 vertical line \nI have this vertical line at the side of my MacBook Pro, any idea what could be causing this/how to fix it?\n\nA: This looks like an issue with your display, your flex cable, or some thing in the graphics part of your motherboard (a bad gpu, bad gpu solder balls, or a bad tantalum capacitor for the gpu).\nIf you feel comfortable, reseat the video flex cable and see if that solves it. If you don't feel comfortable opening your laptop, you'll need to take it in for repair. \nMessing around inside a computer can always cause issues, even for experienced technicians, so if you feel uncomfortable doing it, don't risk it.

This is done with a rescue CD or flash drive - the flash drive is connected, the computer is started up, thereby booting from this drive, and the software on the drive can then reload the disk image from an HDD or wherever that image is located.\nI'm looking for the same functionality in a Mac but can't find it, perhaps because I'm using the wrong term for it. I'm new to the Mac world, and the term \"disk image\" seems to mean something different in that world.\nSo how do I get this recovery functionality (-recover to a previous state from a completely unusable operating system) with a Mac?\n\nA: Boot to the Recovery HD by holding ⌘R on boot. Choose Disk Utility, select your system partition from the sidebar, then select File → New Image → Image from \"<partition name>\". Follow the instructions to choose a save location.\n\nTo restore your image, boot to Recovery, create a partition of equal size or larger than the image you saved (if necessary), then select that partition and choose the Restore button on the toolbar.\n\nThe options are greyed out in the above screenshots as I am not booted to Recovery.\nThe Recovery System is part of macOS and should already be a separate partition on your startup disk (hidden in Disk Utility). You can use Internet Recovery with ⌥⌘R on most Macs to perform a NetBoot-esque recovery using Apple's server, for example if you have a fresh HDD that you want to restore on to.\nIf you want to put a Recovery System on an external disk or secondary internal disk, you can use Recovery Disk Assistant (1 GB required).\n", "Q: How do I replace a value in an plist array using plutil?

Issuing a percentage change is ironically also a very discrete action, because it cannot be fine-tuned without having to issue a new voice command. \n\nA: \nYou said:\n\nUnfortunately, \"Now Playing\" is not a proper watchOS application\n\nOn the contrary, Now Playing is indeed an app on the Apple Watch. At least it is now in watchOS 9.1. See the app icon above, a striped red triangle on a white background.\nWhen streaming audio on apps such as CNBC or Bloomberg,  I find the Now Playing app is always showing on the Watch when I raise my wrist.\nThe only exception is if I am recording my “Workout”, “Outdoor Walk”. And even then I can swipe to the left to see Now Playing.\nIf I bring another app to the front, I can easily return to Now Playing: Press the side button to see the Dock showing recently used apps. That list of apps includes Now Playing.\nWhen the Now Playing app is displayed, spin the crown to raise or lower the volume on the iPhone. In the first moment, the volume indicator in Now Playing may be grey before turning green. Apparently this split-second delay of grey-to-green is the Watch making contact with the iPhone. Almost an annoyance, but the delay is actually less than a second.\nI am happy to report on this feature, as the sole reason for my purchase of an Apple Watch SE (2022) was to adjust the volume of streaming audio while walking the dog. Turns out this remote control for volume does indeed work well, mission accomplished. Happy Bonus: I discovered the Apple Watch is so much more useful than just that.\n", "Q: How can I verify if SSH is disabled with the Terminal on Sierra?

I just downloaded your repository into GitHub Desktop with no problem.\nI would first run GitHub Desktop and make sure it is set up properly and you have installed the command line tools. If that doesn't fix the problem then I would try deleting the app and re-installing it.\nThe final possibility would be rebuilding the LaunchServices database using this command:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n", "Q: Macbook Pro (2010, OSX Sierra) has started prompting me to enter password for DHCP again and again and again All of a sudden my mac has started prompting me to enter my password with the dialog: \"Network Configuration needs to update DHCP setting.

You can find the data that it collected in the directory described above in several zip-files.\nDo you remember where you downloaded handbrake? Did you use the update function?\n", "Q: Sierra - Apache localhost user level and phpMyAdmin I've installed the AMP stack (Apache, MySQL, PHP) and phpMyAdmin on my system.\nI set up user level root too (localhost/~user) and it worked.\nThe things that make me still confused are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is it forbidden to access system level root (http://localhost/) now?\n\n*And if I want to use phpMyAdmin on my user level site (http://localhost/~user/) should I install it again on my localhost/~user?\n\n\nA: The \"Forbidden\" (error 403) error message is something that's generated by the Apache web server\n\n\nWhat you need to check in  your httpd.conf (or related files) that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your global Directory has Options -Indexes (this prevents the server from showing an index of the directory and file structure in the absence of an index.htm or index.html file.  Having this option set and no index.htm file will cause this 403 message to be generated.\n\n*You have the line DirectoryIndex index.html index.php specified.  This will ensure it automatically opens either file name upon entering the directory.  You also want to make sure you have an index.html or an index.php file in the directory.\nIf you want to test out your PHP installation, there's a small piece of code you can put into an index.php file (you can name it anything you want, but it must end with .php).\n<?php  \n   phpinfo(); \n?>\n\nWhen you point your browser to localhost you should now see (your settings will vary of course):\n\nphpMyAdmin\nAs for phpMyAdmin, you can put this anywhere.  You can put it in your users directory (not recommended if you have multiple users that need to use it) or your can create a port based virtual host so that it will be available only if someone knows which port it's listening on.  Have a look at the Apache documentation to see examples and explanations.\nAlso, you might want to have a look at Adminer instead of phpMyAdmin.

This happens with any disk, any format type, and regardless of whether I'm using Disk Utility or Terminal.\nI would like to know what might cause this issue?\n\nA: The first time you try to format the disk it 'fails' to unmount the volume then unmounts it and returns an error. The second time the drive is already unmounted, so the erase usually succeeds.

A slightly better explanation I found on discussions.apple.com:\n\nA whiteout node is used are part of a union file system mount, where a 2nd file system is mounted over a base file system, and the files in both file systems appear to be merged.\nWhen you delete a file in the union file system which happens to be in the bottom layer (which is effectively read-only), the top layer gets a whiteout node created to indicate that the bottom layer file should not be returned on a directory lookup.\nSo while I did not find anything about deleting a whiteout node, my theory is that maybe if you create a real file or directory with the exact same name as the whiteout node you created, the file system will automatically remove the whiteout node. Or try renaming a file to the same name as the whiteout node.\n\n", "Q: How can I select preferred languages when I install applications from homebrew?

See this related question: How can I mount an SMB share from the command line?. I prefer using open because it mounts the shared folder under /Volumes which seems kind of OS X standard, the expected thing. Namely this happens by typing\nopen \"smb://guest:@${host}/${path_component}\"\n\n(where ${host} is the host name or IP address of the Samba share and ${path_component} is the path or \"name\" of the Samba share). \nThe result and the main thing is that I can access the stuff from /Volumes/${path_component}.\nThis is very nice indeed. Just there are two problems or nuisance doing this from within scripts. The first is that this will open a superfluous progress indicator and then Finder window. The second, lesser one as there are scriptable work-arounds, is that the command returns immediately without waiting for the mount to be really available.\nIs there a way to (synchronously) mount Samba shares under /Volumes without extraneous windows popping up?\n(I am using the latest OS X (Sierra).)\n\nA: The following is what I use to mount Samba shares via launchd:\n/usr/bin/osascript -e \"try\" -e \"mount volume \\\"smb://guest@${host}\\\"\" -e \"end try\"\n\nUsing osascript's mount means any keychain access needed is done \"automagically\", there's no progress indicator or Finder window, and the command waits for the mount to be available before proceeding (try it with && echo -n \"Done.\"; mount appended to the end of the above command to test this).\n", "Q: egrep: empty (sub)expression : Unexpected behaviour for bash Loop on Mac I have the filling simplified script on Mac OS X 10.12 :\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\necho \"=> BASH_VERSION = $BASH_VERSION\"\nfunction testForLoopMac {\nlocal file\nfor file\ndo\n    echo File=$file\ndone | egrep \"$file\"\n}\n\nfunction testForLoopMacBis {\nlocal file\nfor file\ndo\n    echo File=$file\ndone | egrep \"$file|OK\"\n}\n\ntestForLoopMac $@\n\ntestForLoopMacBis $@\n\nBut the result when I run is :\n$ testForLoopMac.sh example.pdf \n=> BASH_VERSION = 3.2.57(1)-release\nFile=example.pdf\negrep: empty (sub)expression\n\nOn Debian/Ubuntu Linux, the result is :\n$ testForLoopMac.sh example.md \n=> BASH_VERSION = 4.3.30(1)-release\nFile=example.md\nFile=example.md\n\nEdit : With bash4 on Mac OSX 10.12 :\nI changed the shebang to #!/usr/bin/env bash4 and the result is the same :\n$ testForLoopMac.sh example.md \n=> BASH_VERSION = 4.4.12(1)-release\nFile=example.md\negrep: empty (sub)expression\n\nEdit: Thanks to you guys I understand the behavior difference on Linux or BSD egrep is because that at the time of the egrep execution the variable can be empty.\nI'm going the use therefore, the following regExp :\negrep \"File=|OK\"\nThanks again :)\n\nA: The shell expands the subexpression $file on the right hand side of the pipe before the variable has any value. So in both functions egrep is actually called with the empty string in place of $file. The first function doesn't throw an error because an empty pattern is a valid parameter for egrep both on macOS and on Linux. In the second fucntion the difference comes into play because the empty subexpression causes BSD egrep (the one used on macOS) to throw an error.\nExample:\necho foo | egrep \"|foo\"\negrep: empty (sub)expression\n\nas another example with $file having no value\necho foo | egrep \"$file|foo\"\negrep: empty (sub)expression\n\nSo, as a workaround in your function use:\negrep -e \"$file\" -e 'OK'\n\nI have no idea why you are using egrep when you are looking for fixed strings.\n", "Q: How do I install a specific release of a Homebrew formula on GitHub?

I did record a video on iPhone using timelapse mode. It was by mistake. It was very important video for me. In timelapse mode it is useless... is there a way to convert recording to normal video? Need to recover picture and voice.\n\nA: Unfortunately, it is going to be difficult-to-impossible to make a recording look even somewhat \"normal\" from time-lapsed footage. Normal iPhone video footage is shot at about 30 frame per second, while time-lapsed footage varies between one and two frame per second, depending on the length. \nWhat that means is your iPhone only captured your subject about once per second, so if your subject was walking across the room (for example), they would have traversed about 3 feet in the time it took to capture each frame. All the motion in between is lost. \nUnfortunately, iPhone's time lapse mode does not record audio.\nTo adjust the speed of a clip, download iMovie for iOS (free):\n\n\n*\n\n*With your project open, tap the video clip in the timeline to reveal the inspector at the bottom of the screen.\n\n*Tap the Speed button.\n\n*In the inspector, drag the slider to the left to decrease the speed. \n\n\niMovie may not let you slow your footage enough to bring the speed down to normal. You will likely have to save the edited, slowed-down clip and repeat the process again until the speed of the playback appears normal. \nUnless there is very little motion in the video, I don't think you will be happy with the result, but no harm in trying. I hope it turns out good enough for your purposes!\n\nA: Well I see this in from 2017 but going to answer what I have done so far.  I am a stage manager for a play and I record certain things to help the cast.  In the middle of recording my IPAD PRO 2021 had a mind of its own and changed it to slow motion or something.  I was able to change this by importing the video to the editor app INSHOT.  Once in there I was able to save most of the video.  INSHOT has the ability to change the speed.  Now, this is just my first solution.  Looking into why IPAD PRO 2021 just changed the speed.  I have a guess that my IPAD PRO battery was getting low and it slowed everything down, but that is just a guess.\n", "Q: Old MS Outlook Express for Mac copy/export/move Have an original Apple iMac OS 8.5 , with MS Outlook Express for Mac 4.01 .  My wife and I would like to copy/export the old email messages(from our courtship) off that system.  What File Extensions were used for email messages then?  What folder(s) should I be looking for?\n\nA: Your question doesn't specify how you want to be able to view/store them, but I can think of a few options. Unfortunately, MS Outlook Express for Mac 4.01 doesn't offer any export option, so these are all workarounds.\nBackup the actual data\nBefore doing anything else you should backup the actual data.

To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder on your old iMac's desktop\n\n*Open Outlook Express\n\n*Select the emails you want to keep (or you could just select all)\n\n*Use your mouse to drag them all into the folder you created at Step 1\n\n*Open the folder to check that you now have x number of files in there (there should be one for each email)\n\n*Now you need to transfer that folder on to your newer Mac. Probably the easiest way to do this is to copy the folder onto a USB flash drive and then transfer them via the drive onto your newer Mac. However, depending on your setup, you may have other options open to you.\n\n\nOnce you've copied the folder onto your newer Mac, you can open it using MS Outlook. Depending on the version you have, you may need to drag an individual email onto the Outlook icon on your Dock in order to view it.\nUsing various apps as a go-between to view emails in Apple Mail\nIf you're wanting to access these old emails in Apple Mail, one option may be to use others apps as go-betweens to try to get the data into Apple Mail. However, this may be a hit/miss exercise. By way of example, one way this could work is to do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Outlook Express 5 to install on your old iMac\n\n*Download Eudora 5 to install on your old iMac\n\n*Use Outlook Express 5 to import your emails from Outlook Express 4\n\n*Use Eudora to import the email from Outlook Express 5\n\n*Transfer the Eudora data to your newer Mac\n\n*Use Apple Mail to try and import mail from Eudora\n\n\nThe above is not a step-by-step guide, just a broad summary. As you can see though, it requires a lot of importing data into various formats and may or may not get you to your end goal.\nSave your emails as PDFs\nThis option is probably a good one in that you can view them on any device and choose to combine them as one PDF, or make a book, etc from them.\nProbably the easiest way to do this is to download an old version of Adobe Acrobat to install on your old iMac and use that to save each of the emails as PDFs. You can then transfer the PDFs to your newer device.\nAnother option is to do this after you've transferred the emails to your newer computer via one of the above methods.\nSave your emails as Text\nThis option is another good way to go, because like PDFs you can view them on any device. In fact, you can do this directly from Outlook Express as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder on your old iMac's desktop\n\n*Open Outlook Express\n\n*Select one of the emails you want to keep\n\n*Go to File > Save As\n\n*In the Format drop-down menu, select SimpleText Text Document\n\n*Navigate to the folder you created at Step 1\n\n*Click on the Save button\n\n*Repeat Steps 3 to 7 for each email you want to keep\n\n*Now you need to transfer that folder on to your newer Mac (e.g. using a USB flash drive)\n\n\nOnce you've done this they will each open in TextEdit (or another similar app if you're using Windows etc). Once there you can print, save as PDF, etc.\n", "Q: How to add photos for contacts in iPhone 6s?

I use Finder's Search bar a lot to find specific items nested in my folders. It usually works flawlessly and I find all the items I want. Other times it just doesn't do anything:\nImagine a folder with just 10 files, and one of the is an image ending with .png. If you search .png in the search bar, Finder literally doesn't find it!\nThis happens to me maybe once every couple days. I'm not sure why - relaunching Finder doesn't seem to help either.\n\nA: Indeed, the Finder fails to live up to its name in my experience as well. Results seem so frustratingly random as to what is found and what is missed. \nBeware of one setting that may help: Finder > Preferences > Advanced > \"When performing a search` with a popup menu offering \"Search this Mac\", \"Search the Current Folder\", \"Use the Previous Search Scope\".\n\nBeware of the \"Search\" bar with scope filter buttons that appears when typing search criteria into the upper-right corner.\n\nFinding the Finder nearly useless for finding, so in the past I have in the past purchased a license to Path Finder, a Finder replacement/supplement app. There are other such apps as well.\nAnother option is using command-line tools in Terminal.app. For example, this article shows the use of the find command.

When should each approach be used? \n\n\n*\n\n*When should I prefer one over the other? \n\n*Does it matter whether the package I'm installing is small or large (e.g. numpy)?\n\n*Does it depend on the version of python I'm using (2.x vs. 3.x, or Apple's python vs. MacPort's python)? \n\n*Does it matter whether I have multiple versions of python installed on my Mac? \n\n*Can they be used concurrently? \n\n\nI'm hoping for an answer that has a short listing of some pros/cons of each approach with some discussion about when to choose one over the other. \n\nA: You should use pip because it's the Python-native tool for managing package installations but you shouldn't pip-install things into your base Python installation. It can be a mess to have to sort out fixed version dependencies between multiple software repositories if you're pip-installing everything into your base Python installation on your machine.\nInstead, you should pip-install virtualenv and then use it to manage different, virtual Python installations and all the associated pip-installed packages packages for each virtual environment.\nThis allows you to switch from working with, say, beautifulsoup 1.x in one software repository to beautifulsoup 2.x in another repository without having to wade through dependency management hell.\n\nA: They can be used concurrently, and there should be no issue between mixing the two (with one kinda big caveat and a gotcha...)\nThe Caveat\nThe caveat is that macports/homebrew and pip will have no awareness of each has installed vs the other.\nSo, for example, lets say you install python 3.6 on your Mac.  You want nltk, which is not technically available for that version on Macports, but it is on pip.  So you install on pip.  Two months later, you see its installed on Macports and choose to install it.  Now you have two different versions of nltk on your machine, so caveat emptor.\nThe Gotcha\nIf you do use pip with Macports, you need to make sure that it's the pip that is installed through Macports and associated with that python version.  So, for example, you will see a py35-pip, py36-pip, etc.\nOnce you install the proper pip, you use Macports's select command to make sure that it's activated with the appropriate version of python:\nsudo port select\n\n\nA: In general use one package manager at a time.\nNote things change the last time I really looked at setiups was 3 years ago, I don't think much has changed but pip etc does gain more functionality as time goes on.\nMacports and Homebrew are general package managers for all languages.\npip is a pure python one.\nThere is also conda which is python but does some general purpose stuff as well. It seems to have expanded its scope to cover other languages.\npip (with pipenv) and conda also provide python virtual environments which basically allow different sets of libraries for each project and allows you to set a different version of python for each project. e.g. 2.7, 3.7 3.8 in the others you need to use version specific pip for python versions.\nAnother difference is in parts of a package that have non python dependencies. pip needs to compile those which the others will have a more robust compiler setup and usually will provide a compiled binary.\nI think to install pip you need to bootstrap off macports or homebrew, the pipenv page shows homebrew. Just install python, pip and maybe pipenv from this package manager.\nI now use conda as this seems to provide more and is self contained.  I\nHistorically I used macports for the bootstrap and compile any C libraries e.g. numpy (some of the underlying maths packages have more tuning than pip does) and pip/pipenv for the pure python bits.\n\nA: I just did a quick test searching for the same package using Homebrew, MacPorts and pip3:\nbrew search numpy\nsudo port search --name --glob '*numpy'\npip3 search numpy\n\nMacPorts and pip3 had the same package (version 1.18.1), whereas Homebrew had version 1.16.\nWhen collaborating with others, best to agree on how your development environments are configured or you'll start bumping into anomalies and getting different test results. Therefore, the best tool is the one you all agree on ;-)\n", "Q: Batch change creation dates based on file names I have files that are named like \"12. 2017-04-11 063118.jpg\", and \"123. 2016-09-05 115236.jpg\". The number to the left of the \".\" counts up like an index from 1 to 1400. \nHow can I set the creation date and time according to how it is specified in the file name for all 1400 files I have in the folder. I know the command touch -t changes the creation date, but I do not know how to extract the date/time information from the file name and put this into a command so this is done automatically for all files.\nI know from another thread that the below should work. but i don't know how to tweak the text conversion to correctly apply to my file naming convention. \nfor f in *; do\n    t=$(echo $f | sed -E 's/([A-z]*-)|([ ,;])|(\\..*)//g' | sed -E 's/(.*)(..)/\\1.\\2/')\n    touch -t $t \"$f\"\ndone\n\nThe above code works if my file naming convention is like \"clip-2014-01-31 18;50;15.mp4\", however, I have a different format: \"12. 2017-04-11 063118.jpg\", and \"123. 2016-09-05 115236.jpg\".

It is the only device in the entire house that picks up the wrong IP address. Other iPhones, non-Apple devices, laptops, desktops, etc. are fine. But my phone is always assigned a link-local IP-address (169.254/16) instead of a private IP-address (192.168/16).\nDue to this, it won't even connect to the Internet and I have to type everything manually in Static. I don't want to do this. It was fine till a few days ago. I don't understand the computer terms and would want it to be in layman terms.\nAlso, we have only one router at home. Everything works well (except my iPhone). Can I understand why this is happening and what can I do to make it right?\nPS: The phone is fine. Hardware is fine. I tried the network reset. I tried the software reset too (using iTunes).\n\nA: First let's clear up some nomenclature inaccuracies...\nYour iPhone didn't \"pick up\" a link-local address from the DHCP server.  It assigned itself a private IP based on Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).  There's a huge distinction here and is relevant to the problem you are having:\n\n\n*\n\n*DHCP hands out IP addresses based on a configured pool of addresses.\n\n*APIPA self assigns an address when, for whatever reason, it doesn't get one from DHCP\n\n\n\nSo, armed with this knowledge, we know one of two things happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your DHCP server didn't respond or ignored/denied the request for an address\n\n*Your iPhone didn't request or it rejected/ignored the DHCP offer.\n\n\nDHCP server\nIt's entirely possible that the issue is with the DHCP server on your router. It may have been configured for a small amount of leases and at some point you hit the limit (your previous lease was given to another client).  You may have also \"blocked\" your client (iPhone from the DHCP pool).  Given that your iPhone is the only device not connecting, it would be beneficial to look at the router's DHCP config to see if you have any limitations or restrictions in place.  Restarting it wouldn't hurt, either.\nYour iPhone\nIt's also entirely possible that an update or a configuration change has \"hosed up\" your networking configuration.  Usually, forgetting the wireless network and re-connecting will solve the issue.  \nHowever, one of the best ways to narrow down the possibilities is to connect it to another network.  Take it to your favorite coffee shop, a friends house, or anywhere that has a WiFi network that you can attach to easily.  If you can connect there, then you know the problem is with your home setup.  If it fails on other networks, you most likely have a hardware issue which means it's time to take it in for service.\n\nA: Perhaps something changed a few days ago that's affecting your iPhone's network settings (e.g. a carrier update, software update, etc).\nOne thing you can try is resetting your iPhone's Network settings. You do this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to Settings\n\n*Tap on General\n\n*Swipe up and tap on Reset at the bottom of the screen\n\n*Tap on Reset network settings\n\n\nKeep in mind once you've reset your Network settings you will need to reenter any WiFi passwords again you normally connect to.\nLet me know how you go.\n\nA: Thanks so much Alan for a great explanation of DHCP and APIPA, it was direct exposure of what really goes on in the background. \nAfter nearly running out of my mind and armed with clearer insight I engaged my problem with new vigor only to find out, accidentally interestingly, that I had the wrong password all the time! Oddly enough my iOS never informed me that my password was wrong, it would simply connect with the wrong password and refuse to respond to every attempt by the router to communicate. So the router kept on sending bits of data and my iPhone never made a peep. \nSo for those who've upgraded their drivers or changed their routers, please ensure that your password is still THE password, it just might save you the nightmare of a lifetime. \n\nA: My iPhone 4 was connecting to the wrong router (a router upstairs). It started connecting to the correct router once I set HTTP proxy to Auto. On iPhone 4 Settings - WIFI - Click on name of WIFI network - On the bottom of the page.\n\nA: I had this problem on my iPhone mini 12, from the modem settings(gui: http://192.168.0.1 for me) I set the control channel to 36/80 and STBC Tx to off. I also made the wireless connection type 5Ghz. I am using a Netmaster modem, this solves the problem of obtaining the IP address of the phone or computer.\n", "Q: Counter formula that subtracts with each transaction This must exist, but I can not figure it out with Numbers. I have an inventory of products I sell. I want to automatically subtract from the total original inventory each time an item sells. And to do this, I fill out a re-useable packing slip in Numbers. The item and quantity is listed on the packing slip, which in turn automatically deducts from the inventory- a simple sum formula.\nFor example, I have 200 of an item and in Numbers it is listed as such in a certain cell in a table that keeps track of inventory. If I sell 10 of that item to a new client, I fill out a packing slip. My formula in the packing slip automatically subtracts 10 of that item from inventory. Now the inventory states 190 left. Great so far.\nI save a copy of that packing slip for the client as a pdf. And then later that same standard packing slip is zeroed out and used for the next client. \nSo say the next order is a dozen for that same item. Now a problem. The inventory formula only recognizes the latest entry, so instead of now having 178 items left in inventory (200-10-12=178), the inventory states 188 items left because it 'forgets' about the ten already sold.\nI don't want to manually fill myriads of entries in cells that compute each and every transaction just to make this work. I just want to formulate a running inventory count so each time a packing slip entry is made, the corresponding amount is further subtracted from the ongoing inventory count, just like a barcode reader might subtract from the total as a counter. \nAny ideas? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I do appreciate the effort here to help me with creating a running inventory counter. I realized at some point I better take the initiative and delve into some script so as to create an 'action' on command customized to my needs.\nThe idea was to fill entries of a Packing Slip with item numbers and quantities of that item sold. Then on another sheet that kept track of inventory, the quantity of current items sold would deduct from the remaining inventory. So a script was needed. (a formula would otherwise always revert back with each new entry.)\nBasically, on the Inventory sheet (which had columns of item numbers and starting inventory) I used an IfError function with Match and Index nestled to find and transfer the corresponding entries from the Packing Slip. From there it was a simple process of scripting to create a counter.\nProbably preaching to the choir here, but if anyone is interested, I can furnish the procedure, which involved a combination Numbers functions and applescript.\nI also got a little fancier and insert a chime sound on completion as a reminder that the current order deductions were made from inventory, along with a notification banner.\n", "Q: Is it possible to trigger the built-in Trash sound effect via AppleScript? If one moves any file to the Trash folder on a Mac, by default, a short sound effect plays through the Mac's audio output (assuming that the system audio has not been muted).\nI have an .scpt file where nothing is truly being moved to the Trash folder, but I would still like to have the Trash sound effect play.\nI understand that I can download the sound effect onto my computer as an audio file from the Internet, and write:\ndo shell script \"afplay /Users/Me/Desktop/TrashSoundEffect.aiff\"\n\nHowever, I would prefer to reference the built-in Trash sound effect. Is this possible?\nI just don't like the idea of having to rely on an additional file to have my AppleScript function correctly. The built-in sound effect is more reliable, as it is guaranteed to remain on my computer indefinitely.\n\nA: How about this one:\ndo shell script \"afplay '/System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds/dock/drag to trash.aif'\"\n\n\nUpdate:\nTo address your comment, this is covered in Technical Note TN2065 - do shell script in AppleScript under Other Concerns where it says:\n\n\"... how do I make do shell script not wait until the command completes?\" \nUse do shell script \\\"command &> file_path &\\\". do shell script will return immediately with no result and your AppleScript script will be running in parallel with your shell script.

I sometimes run distributed computing projects in BOINC Manager while my iMac is idle. Often, a Force Quit dialog appears displaying the message 'Your system has run out of application memory'. When this happens, all open applications except the Finder are paused and have to be manually restarted, one-by-one, from the dialog box.\nI could reduce the amount of RAM that BOINC Manager can use, but I’d prefer to allocate as much RAM as possible to BOINC projects. How can I prevent macOS from suspending BOINC (or any other app or apps) when the system runs out of RAM?\nUpdate: this issue appears to have been fixed by a recent BOINC update.\n\nA: You most probably do not want to avoid macOS from suspending apps when the system runs out of RAM when you know that the only alternative is to kill the program. I.e. stop the program from running now and here without saving its data or anything like that.\nHowever, you do not have to restart the programs that are paused as in \"close the program and start it over\". Instead you can actually unpause the program when you have sufficient free memory on the system. You can do this from the terminal by running:\nkill -CONT <pid>\n\nwhere  should be replaced with the process ID of the process, you want to unpause.\nYou can find process ID using Activity Monitor or the \"ps\" command in the Terminal (in this case, look for processes with status T as these are the paused/stopped ones).\nAn easy way of unpausing and finding the ID in one go is:\nkill -CONT `pgrep myprogram`\n\nwhere myprogram is the name of the program you want to unpause.\nThe second part of your question where you describe the ideal scenario is very hard to accomplish with a standard program. In general programs can request memory from the operating system, but the operating system cannot request it back afterwards. It is possible, but it requires very specialized programs which is generally not the case.\nThis means that once macOS have granted your program for example 1 GB of RAM, the operating system cannot just take it back when other programs want more memory. If you take away memory from programs that are not specially crafted to allow that, they will effectively crash as soon as they attempt to use the lost memory.\n", "Q: Are Apple devices really Apple centric?

Chromium is the open source project behind Google Chrome and Canary is the bleeding edge \"beta software\". It very similar to the relationship of RedHat Linux, CentOS and Fedora.\nIf you want this functionality, you need to download the respective project and run that browser; it's not something you can enable in the production version.\n\nA: While this was indeed an issue for a long time, the most recent update to Chrome now brings Force Touch lookup functionality in the same way as does Safari.

If you do you'll probably end up with a mess by breaking the links between your media and iMovie projects.\nYour best approach is to delete any media you're not using from within iMovie itself. \nUsing iMovie to delete media is the safest way to preserve your projects as you can visually see if what you're deleting is being used in your project. In fact, if what you’re trying to delete is being used in a project, iMovie will prompt you to remove the clip from the project before deleting it. This safeguard obviously isn't available if you try to delete media manually from within the Finder.\nThe process for deleting media within iMovie will depend on the version of iMovie you're using. In some versions you have a Move to Trash option, while in others it's labeled as Delete Media from Event.\nYou may find iMovie for Mac: Organize media and events of interest. Alternatively, you can access the iMovie for Mac guide.\nIf the above links aren't useful because you're using a different version of iMovie, post a comment to advise what version of iMovie you're using and I can provide some steps for you to follow.

To catch this error, wrapping the formula in the IFERROR function allows the author to supply a default (in the OP's case, an empty string \"\") to display in the event of no match.\nThe following example uses a third table to display the translation.

I have a MacBook Pro that's Continuity-connected to an iPhone 6+ running iOS 10, and when they share a Wifi connection provided by a third device, making and receiving iPhone cellular calls from the laptop works fine.\nNow my intent is to provide the MacBook Pro's internet connection via the iPhone's Instant Hotspot, using Wifi, while still being able to make and receive cellular calls from the Mac.\nIs this setup possible?\nI fear it is not (but I cannot verify it myself, unfortunately), because an Apple support article states states as one of the prerequisites:\n\nEach device is connected to the same network using Wi-Fi or Ethernet.\n\nWhile the iPhone and the Mac are clearly connected in my scenario, the iPhone itself provides the Wifi network, but isn't itself connected to it.\nIs there any way to make this work?\n\nA: Answer\nNo, unfortunately it is not possible to make or receive cellular calls from Mac that is connected to an iPhone using Personal Hotspot.\nYou can avoid this limitation using a dedicated mobile hotspot.\n\nWhat happens if you try it\nTrying to do so will result in a message like this (\"iPhone Not Available\", \"Your iPhone and Mac must be on the same Wi-Fi network.\").\n\n\nExplanation\nAs you already pointed out, it is only possible to handoff a cellular call to another Mac/iOS device, if Each device is connected to the same network using Wi-Fi or Ethernet.\nIf you connect your Mac to your iPhone's Personal Hotspot, your devices do not use the same Wi-Fi network. In fact, only your Mac is connected to a Wi-Fi network created by your iPhone. Your iPhone isn't connected to a Wi-Fi network at all. It connects using GPRS/Edge/3G/LTE using its cellular modem.\nIn order for some handoff (including cellular phone calls) features to work on a Mac, your iPhone and your Mac need a Wi-Fi network to stream the phone call's voice data reliably. While this may result in some negligible lag, it's much more reliable than Bluetooth. You don't need to be in your phone's proximity for this to work as long as both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network.\nFuther details\nThis is technical limitation.\nThe iPhone has two built-in network adapters; en0 (Wi-Fi) and pdp_ip0 (cellular data). When you turn on the Personal Hotspot and a device connects to it, your iPhone transfers the cellular data connection (pdp_ip0) to another network adapter. It's very similar to the macOS's built-in Internet Sharing (System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing). Now the name of this network adapter is not en0 (Wi-Fi), but instead ap1 (Wi-Fi Access Point). This is the Wi-Fi module running in a different mode.\n", "Q: Can I update the flagged emails in Mail 10?

This can be done per mailbox with Mail's Mailbox > Rebuild command, but it can be simpler and quicker to force a rebuild for all mailboxes en masse by manually deleting the index files.\nThese instructions work for Sierra.

If it makes a difference I do not have wifi access only cellular data.  Can I test my Apple ID another way?\n\nA: Before you call your cellular carrier to be sure they're not somehow blocking, try to log in to http://discussions.apple.com\nThat should verify you have internet access and the AppleID itself is active. If not - you'll need help from Apple Support to reset your account or investigate if it's locked. (Or the carrier to get you connected to the internet)\nAssuming you can log in, I would put the device in AirPlane mode and then change the date/time to be about a minute off what you think the time is. \n\nsettings > general > date & time\n\nThen disable AirPlane mode and re-enable automatic time setting and see that the carrier gets your device to the correct time.\nAt that point, try the iCloud preference pane. That should get you a decent chance that the device re-connects to the services. Unless there is a service outage - you should have a specific error message at this point to track down for iCloud settings (or whichever of the other items using your AppleID you start with after resetting the time and network connections).\n", "Q: Mail obsessed with an old message This is on IOS but it has happened on OS X in the past.\nNo matter how many messages I have received, read, or replied to, every time I open Mail, the same five-week-old message is selected, and I have to scroll a long way to get to the new ones.\nNot earth-shaking, but I'd like to find a way to make it always go to the new messages like it used to.\nI moved the message to another folder, which made the inbox not have any selected.  But that's probably temporary—last time this happened, Mail soon began stalking another message.\n\nA: The mail database is probably messed up a little. You can often fix mailbox folder issues by rebuilding them. It's easy to do.\nOpen Mail.app and select the mailbox with the email in question. That's the MAILBOX not the message. From the Mailbox menu select \"Rebuild\" (at the bottom of the menu) and let Mail do its thing. Depending on the size of the mailbox this can take seconds or quite a bit longer.

I've restored my Winclone image to a new (bigger) partition.Just wondering how to get rid of the 'recovery-10.xx.x' drive from the boot menu after pressing option key? Bootcamp and MacOS still show up fine by the way.\n\nA: If I recall correctly (no guarantee of that ;-) the Recovery partition usually shows up in the \"Option boot menu.\"\nIf I am inexplicably wrong likely the only way to get rid of it would be to boot from an OS install thumb drive that you created previously (you did create one previously, didn't you?) and reinstall from scratch. during the OS install open Disk Utility, delete both partitions and then create one new one to install Mac OS onto and install. The install process will re-create the emergency boot partition behind the scenes. Once that is done you can restore your files and apps from your back up that you cleverly thought to make before wiping your hard drive.\nThere I think I have covered most of the bases here...

(on iPhone, there's only one shuffle all control)\nIf no track is playing - it starts playing one of the tracks and for me that's pretty random (i.e. a second press almost always queues up a different track than the last press of shuffle all)\n\nIn the shown track - the items are playing from iCloud - so there is a delay to start playback, but if the track is downloaded or cached it's quite responsive to tap shuffle all several times.\nI do also greatly prefer the Cesium music app on my iPhone for queuing up playlists. It has the traditional - repeat one song, repeat the playlist, or end playing controls visible below:\n\nIt has very nice queuing and gestures to control playback as well as filters to only show music that's downloaded or also include iCloud music. I tend to use this app for road trips or playlists at a party when I know I have a copy of the songs I want downloaded to the device.\n", "Q: What does it mean when the Mac shows a shared folder (named a PC) in the Finder sidebar? I just noticed that in the Finder sidebar, I can see a PC under the shared section. Does it mean someone has access to the files on my laptop?\nI saw online that I can remove it by unchecking certain things from Finder preferences. Does this remove the shared computer altogether or only remove the name from sidebar so I can't see it?\n\nA: No - Finder shows you other servers / file shares so think of this like a directory of other computers to knock on their doors to ask if any files are being shared.\nYour Mac controls sharing from the system preferences pane. By default, file sharing is off and if you turn it on, your password and user account is needed on the remote computer to look at any of your shared files.\nYes - you are correct that the preferences just hides those other computers from your view - that computer is still on the network and still \"advertising\" that it might be sharing files.\n\nThe PC above is actually a HP printer/scanner that has a slot for a SD card to be read. The rest are Apple computers with file sharing or screen sharing enabled. Those wouldn't show up if the sharing system preference was turned off for all the potential items to be shared.\nTechnically - the PC icon indicates SMB sharing of a printer or file share and/or possibly VNC screen sharing. Mac computers sharing a screen or file share shows up with Mac specific icons.\n", "Q: Is there a way to turn off flat UI in MacOS Sierra? I recently \"upgraded\" to macOS Sierra (10.12).

Most importantly, don't take shortcuts.\n", "Q: MZFinance.BadLogin.MacAppStore_message error when signing into Apple ID I get the above error message when trying to sign in to my Apple ID when trying to do a fresh install of OSX on my mac mini.

Recently I noticed my Mac would freeze when I plug in this disc - also there is a directory in the top hierarchy that I could not open.  Since this drive moves around a lot I suspected an unlucky disconnection caused corruption. Checked the drive and the only partition with disk-utility \"first aid\" - which report everything is fine.  Despite this in the system log there are plenty of I/O errors.  Looks like I need to trash it.  But I sure had loved it if my mac gave me any warning that I was using a bad drive (I kinda forgive the PS4 that she didn't warn).\nSo for the future what check should I use?  \nI see that there are older questions discussing a similar questions, though they are 5 years old and also some of the link tools are dead now.  Also this question is not about data recovery, but how to asses a drive.\ntl;dr What program (on mac) can I trust to check my discs?\n\nA: I reccomend Disk Drill.  Their diagnostic and monitoring tools are free, but the recovery functionality (if you need it) is what you will have to purchase.\nThere's also a very robust set of command line (CLI) tools available as open source:  smartmontools.  This is a available as a macOS binary package so you don't need to install via brew or MacPorts.\nImportant:  One thing to keep in mind when diagnosing external drives is that you have two components:\n\n\n*\n\n*the drive itself\n\n*the USB enclosure\n\n\nI have had USB enclosure's fail (the USB to SATA portion) that looked like a drive failure.  The best way to get around this is to remove the drive (if you can) and use a separate USB-SATA Adapter.  What you are doing is eliminating one of the components from the diagnostic equation (the USB interface) with a \"known working\" component.  They are cheap (approx $10) to keep for diagnostic purposes.\n\nThat said, a drive diagnostic is not a \"quick status check.\"  To find bad blocks you may need to do a \"deep scan\" because a bad block isn't reported until the drive encounters a bad block.\n", "Q: What is the case screw length and thread pitch for the 2010 MacBook 13\" Model 7,1? I have a 2010 MacBook 13\" Model 7,1. It has recently gotten some upgrades and one of the screws wandered off and was eaten by a grue. \nWhat length and thread pitch are the eight screws holding the bottom panel on to the laptop body on this model? \nThese screws and panel are shown in this iFxit tutorial. I see that these are 4mm screws. I would like to know the screw size so that I can just order them as generic screws in my next McMaster-Carr delivery. \nMetric screws are measured by the outside diameter of the threads, the spacing between threads and the length as in Ma-b X c. iFixit tells me the length is 4mm. So I have Ma-b X 4mm. I need to know a and b. I suspect that this may be a non-standard or atypical screw size.\n\nA: You didn't mention which screw you lost.  It's important to know because there are a number of different screws specific to that model:\n\n\n*\n\n*3 mm Phillips #0. (Head: 2.75 mm. dia.) \n\n*4 mm Phillips #0.

Any idea how could I disable the CPU reduction?\n\nA: Searching the man page for pmset (man pmset)  on macOS 10.11 - El Capitan for anything related to reducing CPU speed yielded no results; though I was able to find an Apple discussion thread dating back to 2008.\nI suspect that the user ability to regulate CPU speed was removed at some point.  \nThat said, the issue is that you have a failing/failed battery and it needs to be replaced.  Your CPU is throttling itself down becuase it has detected low reserves in your battery and is close to shutting down; this is by design.\nYou didn't mention which specific model you had, but generically speaking, you will have to get the top case replaced.\nHowever, iFixit has some instructions on how to replace the battery without replacing the entire top case.

Is there anyway to retrieve the data? I am posting this for a friend.  For some reason the iPhone 5 suddenly won't turn on anymore.  When the power button is pressed the screen lights up, the apple logo shows and then it switches to another screen where the following url is shown: support.apple.com/iphone/restore, the iTunes logo and the a picture of a cable beneath.\nWhat I have tried:\nI have visited the url and followed the steps listed on the page, namely holding the power and home buttons for ten seconds, waiting and then trying to turn the phone on again.\nI have connected to iTunes and tried to update the phone but this is unsuccessful and produces an error, with error code 26 which gives me this link here: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/ht201210.  I have followed the steps on this page as well.\nWhat I think the problem is:\nI believe the phone started to update but didn't have enough space and at some point the update failed midway and now the phone can't turn on.  I believe this is also the reason why it wont update via iTunes.  I do not know however as I wasn't present during this time and my friend isn't sure either, all she knows is it wont turn on anymore.\nThe phone has no backup and my friend would very much like to keep / retrieve the data on the phone somehow.  Therefore we have avoided trying a factory reset at this point.  \nWe have taken it to a shop and they referred us to a specialist shop saying it would cost ~2000€ to decrypt and retrieve the data before performing a reset which is ridiculous.  \nAre there any steps or methods we could further try before resorting to a factory reset and losing the data or having to cough up all this money?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Disk Drill or iFunbox may be able to help. It is evident that you are able to access the iPhone for a restore, so Disk Drill is likely the best choice. \nDisk drill will create the best backup that it can with the files left unencrypted, and iFunbox will only be able to access whatever the phone can.\nBest of Luck!\n\nA: You can attempt to retrieve the data yourself, or asking some friend who is able to do it.\nBasically, you need to take out the motherboard, take out the flash drive chip using few repair tools, then you can use Flash Memory Chip Programmer For iPhone (~$260), which can read and modify data of NAND flash memory chip (so you can backup the data into another drive).

The laptop has a small SSD, so I use the optimize space feature to keep only low-res photos locally. \nThis all works great, but I want to have a backup of the full-res photos on an external disk, in case the iCloud servers fail. Time Machine will only backup the low-res photos in the local library. I want to continue using the local Photo Library without having the external backup disk connected all the time.\nOne possibility is to create a second macOS user account, set it up with the same iCloud credentials, disable optimized storage, set its Photo Library location to the external disk, and login to this account weekly to do a backup. But this seems sort of clunky. What is the preferred \"Apple way\" of doing this? \n\nA: @Elliott: Do you have the option of creating regular backups of your external disks? If so, you could symlink your photo library to the external source, backup that source however often you like, all the while using your full res photos instead of the low res versions. The photos would not be stored on your Mac hard drive (thus freeing up that space), but would be stored on backed-up external drives instead.\nI've successfully done this before using both iPhoto and iTunes (among other things), and now regularly move all my important things to external drives for safe keeping. Backups of your backups is key, but drive space is cheap!\nLet me know if I can be of further assistance.\n\nA: Unfortunately, no, not for now. There is currently not an Apple way to do this. \nIndeed, there can be at most one photo library connected to the iCloud Photo Library under each Mac user account. And that is simply called the system library. Hence, I believe the way you are doing it is the most feasible one. And this is also true for iTunes.\nApple just assumes that \n\n\n*\n\n*They are a mass market brand whose customers purchase simple, intuitive, reliable and secure products. And the majority of their customers find the solution Apple provides is the easiest to get things sorted out. Therefore, they do not provide iCloud Photo Library access to third-party applications or services, like the way others do.\n\n*When you purchase any Apple product, you have your potential future storage needs clear in mind when selecting the storage configuration (as they are constantly notifying you on their website):\n\nPlease note that the storage is built into the computer, so if you think you’ll need additional storage capacity in the future, it’s important to upgrade at the time of purchase.

They also insisted that installing a hybrid drive would run into similar problems (though their explanation for why that should be doesn't quite jibe with what little I know about how hybrid drives are supposed to work).\nFrankly, very little of what they're saying really jibes with what I'm seeing in various forums, so I need a second opinion as to whether or not what they're saying holds up -- is what I want to do reasonably do-able? I'm seeing a lot of success stories from 2013 or so, but I'm wondering about the long term as well....\n\nA: There is a small element of historical truth in their recommendation. Until quite recently (10.10.4), the Mac didn't support TRIM on 3rd party SSDS. That meant that in some use cases with some SSDs, the drive could theoretically wear out faster and suffer from performance degradation over time. The practical effect was always hotly contested but it doesn't really matter since TRIM for 3rd party drives is supported in Sierra. \nThere's no obvious reason that your WD Blue SSD wouldn't work\nA Fusion drive is a bit trickier as you have to completely disassemble the Mac Mini to install two drives in it. Replacing a single drive isn't too bad as long as you have the right tools, a reasonable amount of dexterity, and are good at following directions. There are a couple of tricky bits and sliding the drive back into the right position can be frustrating but nothing too bad. I've done it about 10 times without screwing anything up. One SSD failed but it was after 5 years so I doubt it was related to the install.\nMacsales is a good source of the right tools, adapters/parts, and instructional videos. They also provide good tech support if you buy one of their drives.\nEither look for another shop that is more comfortable doing the upgrade, tell the current shop that you appreciate the advice but you want what you want, or do it yourself.

But, I have found that if the filename contains a forward slash (/), then the file will not be created.\nLet's suppose that I would like to create a file entitled: This is my / file.txt.\nI can create this file manually in Finder.app without error, which indicates that the OS allows forward slashes in filenames (unlike the colon, for example).\nHere is some code (i.e., a snippet from my Service) to reproduce the error:\nset theCustomFilename to text returned of (display dialog \"Enter filename:\n\" default answer \"This is my /file\")\n\nset thePath to \"/Users/Me/Desktop/\"\nset theFileExtension to \".txt\"\nset theCustomFilePathname to thePath & theCustomFilename & theFileExtension\n\ntry\n    set fileHandle to open for access theCustomFilePathname with write permission\n    write \"This is the document text.\" to fileHandle\n    close access fileHandle\non error eStr number eNum\n    display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"File I/O Error...\" with icon caution\n    try\n        close access fileHandle\n    end try\nend try\n\nIf you run the above code, you will be given the error:\n\nFile /Users/Me/Desktop/This is my / file.txt wasn’t found. number -43\n\n\nA: You should never use the forward slash (/) in your filenames.\nAs an experiment, I opened TextEdit and saved a file with a forward slash in the name\n\nListing out the directory comments we get:\n$ ls\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 areed  staff   102B May  9 02:02 .\ndrwx------+ 29 areed  staff   986B May  9 02:05 ..\n-rw-r--r--@  1 areed  staff   325B May  9 02:00 Test:this.rtf\n\nIt changes the forward slash out to a colon.\nAn interesting thing happens when you use bash's autocomplete function; hit tab more than once and instead of \"stopping\" when it has found the full match, it keeps going:\n$ cat Test\\:this.rtf Test\\:this.rtf Test\\:this.rtf Test\\:this.rtf Test\\:this.rtf Test\\:this.rtf\n\nIn the above example, I typed cat Tes and then pressed Tab 5 times.  Instead of beeping and stopping, it kept repeating as if stuck in a loop; this is not correct behavior.\nDoing a search on this behavior, I stumbled across this article from C|Net:  Do not use \"forward slash\" in Mac OS X filenames, Distiller 6.0 example.  The article is quoted as saying:\n\nThe forward slash should also never be used in the name of a drive or\n  partition, or virtually in any other name field in Mac OS X. The\n  reason behind this limitation stems from Mac OS X's UNIX underpinnings\nIn prior versions of Mac OS the location of a file was noted using a\n  path, with the colon ( :) separating objects. Mac OS X uses the\n  forward slash ( /) in place of the colon.\n\nIt seems that this behavior/limitation is still present in macOS.  Bottom line, don't use the forward slash in your filename.\n\nA: The confusion you are having is because the Finder allows you to use / in a file name by mapping the / to : under the hood. In the file system itself you are not allowed to have a file name contains a / character but you are allowed a : character.\nThis has come about because the original MacOS used the : as the path separator while OS X, like all Unix based operating systems, used / so the Finder was written to map one to the other.\nIn your AppleScript code you are using Unix paths so the code fails. Instead use a : character in your code and you will see a / in the filename in the Finder.\n\nA: There exists a solution.\nI've figured out a method that allows a forward-slash character in a filename. My solution is inspired by the code provided in this answer, written by user3439894.\nUsing the code that I provided in my original post, change this line:\n\n\n*\n\n*set thePath to \"/Users/Me/Desktop/\"\nto:\n\n\n*\n\n*set thePath to POSIX file \"/Users/Me/Desktop/\"\nAnd, change this line: \n\n\n*\n\n*set theCustomFilePathname to thePath & theCustomFilename & theFileExtension\nto:\n\n\n*\n\n*set theCustomFilePathname to (thePath & theCustomFilename & theFileExtension) as string\nYou are now able to successfully include a forward-slash character in the filename, without error, just as you are free to do in Finder.app (or from the Save As menu in TextEdit.app).\n\nLess controversial solution:\nIf you are worried about the admonitions offered in the other two answers to this question, regarding the evils of the forward slash, I have devised a fully \"aboveboard\" workaround. (FWIW, I have never seen a forward-slash character in one of my filenames cause an issue before.)\nOne can simply replace the standard forward-slash symbol in the submitted string with an alternative forward-slash symbol. The alternative symbol looks close enough to the real symbol for the desired punctuational effect of a forward slash to be maintained.\nThis solution is \"less controversial\" because OS X does not bar this obscure alternative symbol as a filename character.\nHere is the AppleScript code:\nif theCustomFilename contains \"/\" then\n    set theCustomFilename to replace_chars(theCustomFilename, \"/\", \"∕\")\nend if\n\nThe above code uses a replace_chars sub-routine. This sub-routine replaces every instance of a defined sub-string in a string, with a new string:\non replace_chars(this_text, search_string, replacement_string)\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to the search_string\n    set the item_list to every text item of this_text\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to the replacement_string\n    set this_text to the item_list as string\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\n    return this_text\nend replace_chars\n\n", "Q: App to run Chrome web extensions on iPad I have now moved from Android to iOS. In Android , I used Yandex Browser in which I can use Chrome web extensions. But in the Yandex Browser iOS app f, I can't download chrome web extension. \nDoes anyone know of a browser on iOS that allows the use of Chrome web extensions?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no such browser. The reasons are the App Store review guidelines, which forbid the execution of downloaded code (such as web extensions).\nYour best bet is to download browsers with lots of features built-in like iCab or similar and hope it covers your use-case.\nOtherwise, maybe you can achieve what you want by having a desktop browser running somewhere and connecting to that using screen sharing from your iPad…\n\nA: Browsers in the iOS appstore aren’t allowed to ship with what chrome apps and extensions need.\nHowever, there are plenty safari extensions available in the appstore though.\nSafari is a browser that also is built from webkit (the first), it comes pre-installed.\n", "Q: Is there any app to always display time in touch bar?

He shutdown the Macbook Pro and a few days later removed the HD. He bought a new Macbook Pro for XMAS and the old HD works fine in an external case. \nLast weekend he gave me his old MacBook Pro. What I would like is to give the motherboard and other components a clean to see if I can get this working. But I have no idea what to use and how to clean it?\nCan someone share how I would go about this and what I would use to clean it?\n\nA: Test it first!!\nOkay, this may seem strange (and many would disagree with me) but based on your question it sounds like the MBP was immediately shutdown after the spill and hasn’t been used at all since for about five months. If that’s the case there’s a very real chance the MBP will be fine if there wasn’t too much coffee penetration and the spill wasn’t near the worst possible areas (you don’t say where the spill was, or how much of it there was). But, being human, I assume the first thing your brother-in-law did (besides shutting it down) was to remove the MBP from the coffee spill and soaking up any obvious external signs of coffee with paper towels. This may be wishful thinking on my behalf, but I figure if he had the sound mind to shut it down, unplug it, and not restart it again (plus the knowledge required to remove the hard drive), that he had some idea of what he was doing. \nI guess what I’m saying is, if it was me I would connect it up to a bootable drive (you can just do this via USB) and power it up. You’ll know soon enough if it’s going to work. If so you’ve saved yourself a bit of effort without the risk associated with cleaning a logic board (i.e. motherboard) etc. If it doesn’t work, your chances drop significantly, but not totally. So below is how I’d proceed to clean the logic board/components. \nWARNING!!!\nBefore you begin ensure the MBP is not connected to an AC power supply. \nRemoving the bottom cover\nThe bottom cover has 10 screws. To remove these you will need a Phillips #00 screwdriver. While you may get away with another method to remove them, don’t do this as you may thread/damage the screws in the process!\nAlso, I strongly suggest as you remove each screw you place them on a towel or similar material so they don’t move/roll away, and that you do this in the pattern that you removed them. This is because these 10 screws are not actually all the same - three of the rear ones are about 3x longer than the others, and the four front ones are shouldered screws - so make sure you don’t get them mixed up! \nRecommended:  I strongly recommend you follow the first four steps of this iFixit guide - it shows you how to remove the cover and how to also remove the battery connector from its socket on the logic board. \nIf for whatever reason you don’t feel comfortable removing the battery connector, you can try to ensure the battery has no charge in it!! When you’re satisfied this is the case, press the Power Button for a while (say 15 or so seconds) and then let the MBP sit there for at least 20 minutes before doing anything else. It’s a good chance to grab a coffee - just make sure you don’t drink it anywhere near the MBP! :)\nTip: It’s also good to use a magnetic screwdriver to remove the screws (just so you don’t drop them on the floor - most are too small to find easily).\nOnce the cover and battery connector are removed, proceed below.\nCleaning dust and other dry substances\nAnything dry, be it dust, the remains of an old insect, etc, should be removed by gently brushing it off with a totally clean brush. You can actually use a small clean paint brush (preferably an artist’s paint brush) or even a toothbrush - just remember to be gentle and not to use anything that’s wet or dirty! \nIn some cases the brush is just loosening these substances and if you can’t whisk them away with the brush, you can use a can of compressed air to gently blow them away. \nNotes re: using a can of compressed air - Make sure you do not shake the can or spray it upside down. Before spraying anywhere near your logic board, spray the can elsewhere first to get used to controlling the air pressure.  When you do use it, try your best not to spray it at an angle.\nCleaning grime etc\nIn this case we know you’ll also need to clean a type of grime (after all, dried coffee is going to be somewhat sticky originally especially if it also had sugar and/or milk in it). Regardless, the process is largely the same for anything that’s a grimy sort of mixture, be it coffee, coke, juice, etc.\nBecause the inside of a MBP is extremely precise and everything fits in perfectly, even dust can have a hard time getting in there (quite unlike many desktops!). Obviously, cooling fans may collect dust etc, but I would give the logic board a really good looking over because the coffee spill may be limited to only a small portion of the interior, in which case you can limit the cleaning only to the affected area!\nIf you find that there’s coffee on any of the removable components, then remove those components (e.g. this MBP has two memory slots, so remove any RAM modules). If the RAM modules look like they’ve been affected by the coffee, then you can clean them separately later. Note: If you do remove any components, make a note of where you removed them from. Also take a photo beforehand!\nNow, I’ve seen a lot of different cleaning solutions used over the years to clean the insides of a computer, ranging from household detergents that do not contain phosphates to methylated spirits (once I saw it done with a paint thinner). However, my strong recommendation and the only liquid I ever use inside a computer is a rubbing alcohol (such as Isopropyl Alcohol). You can buy different grades of purity, but I prefer 100% Isopropyl Alcohol (or close to it). You should be able to buy this from a good electronics store or hardware store. Otherwise if you get stuck, check your local supermarket for what grade of Isopropyl Alcohol they sell. Even if you can’t get close to 100%, a lower grade of Isopropyl Alcohol is preferable to most other cleaners.\nMy personal preferences is to pour a little of it onto a lint free cloth or terry-cloth towel or lens cleaning cloth. If you haven’t got one of these, buy yourself a lint free or terry cloth - it will come in handy many times over. If you get really stuck, you can use coffee filters. Either way, use one of these to clean anywhere on the logic board that has signs of coffee on it.  \nNow, if you did have to remove any RAM modules because they showed signs of coffee, then start by using compressed air (remember my tips above on using these cans) to blow them clean, especially around the contacts. Now also do the same where the slots are on the logic board. Assuming you did get your hands on some strong Isopropyl Alcohol (say 95% +), use this to dampen the RAM module contacts and then insert the RAM in and out of the slots a few times before proceeding to clean the contacts.\nOnce you’re done, the Isopropyl Alcohol shouldn’t take long to dry - but just to be safe you may want to let things sit a while before putting it all back together.\nTesting it\nOnce you’re satisfied everything is dry and put back together properly, try powering it up. If you have no joy, take note of any audible cues you get (e.g. startup tones) or whether there’s any sign of it powering up at all. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you do get audible cues and/or hear signs of it powering up, then there’s things you can try (such as resetting the SMC, resetting the NVRAM, running Apple Hardware Test, alternating memory modules, replacing certain components, etc), but I’ll leave that for another question if it gets to that point.\n\n*If you get absolutely no signs of power you could decide to remove the logic board altogether and inspect it for other areas requiring cleaning. You can view this iFixit Guide to do so, but keep in mind that this is much more involved then the process above.\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*If you decide to insert a replacement drive, you can follow this iFixit procedure for replacing the drive.\n\n*Remember to keep a track of which screws go where!\n", "Q: iMac 5K Bootcamp Black Screen when playing I have an iMac 5k late-2014 with R9 M295x GPU, I'm using the graphic drivers from bootcampdrivers.com, as the default ones don't work with newer games like Forza Horizon 3...

A PC won't work as I know.\nIf you still don't receive the code on your iDevices, try the following on your iPhone or iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Your Name (Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes & App Store) > Password & Security.\n\n*Enter your Apple ID password when asked.\n\n*Tap Get Verification Code\nThis might only work with Keychain enabled on your iDevice.\nIf you don't have any other Apple devices, it could be your last option to reset the iCloud Keychain. But in this case I'd prefer to call the official Apple Support.\n", "Q: What is the gray circle Finder shows next to a file, that is not a tag? Today, I noticed a image I downloaded earlier (one of two) has a large gray circle at the right-hand edge of the Name column in Finder:\n\nNote that the other image made at almost the same time doesn't have it.\nThis is not a tag. When adding the gray tag to the file, it looks like this, with a second small gray circle.\n\nThe large gray circle is something different. What is it?\nThis is macOS Sierra, 10.12.4, on a 2013 model Macbook Pro. Last night, when the image was made, neither had a gray circle.  It's appeared sometime in the last 24 hours.\nEdit: the file is located in Downloads, and (edited from original) was actually a downloaded file from Chrome. I do not have iCloud sync enabled for files. The gray circle was not present last night or earlier today; in fact since I posted the question, the circle has disappeared, reappeared, and disappeared again - only for this file and no others.\n\nA: I've had the same issue. The dot appeared when I edited the original download (eps) file in Illustrator, I've deleted the background. I guess it was somehow linked with the browser and had noticed a difference between the downloaded file and the currently edited one. The gray dot disappeared when I renamed the file.\nI hope this helps, and yes, it is very annoying.\n\nA: Thanks for clarifying the question about the location and your OS. \nIn your case, the grey dot is a progress indicator for a downloaded file. It used to be a horizontal bar, filling up as the download progresses. Now it's a circle filling up clockwise. \nSometimes, the circle does not disappear, like in your case, indicating an incomplete download. \nIMO, it is not directly an application problem, since I have seen this behaviour in Google Chrome as well as Opera and Safari. There was a report here on SE about this being a bug in Chrome (see here), but in the comments, you see other users had had it happened in other apps as well.\nSince the file still opens, it seems to be a finder refresh problem for which there are several solutions. \n\n\n*\n\n*The easiest would be to wait (not clear how long) for it to disappear (like in your case).\n\n*Try restarting the app with which you downloaded the file, in your case Google Chrome.\n\n*You could try forcing a refresh of the finder window by changing the directory, e.g. by moving up or downward a level or closing and reopening the finder window. \n\n*You could logout of your profile and login again (a bit too much IMO).\n\n*There is a similar problem with the finder dock and recommendations are to kill the dock via a terminal command (again look here on SE in the comments). You could do something similar with the finder, but I would not recommend it.\n\n\nI hope it clarifies this problem a bit.\n\nA: Is the file located in ~/Documents or ~/Desktop and do you have iCloud Drive turned on? If yes, this is the upload indicator saying the file is almost 100% uploaded. But sometimes it can freeze. Maybe the last Bit has not been uploaded or you just have to reboot your system to make it disappear.\nOn the other hand, if this file is located in ~/Downloads then it is the download indicator. The issue is similar to the one above. It can be that the file was not fully downloaded.\n", "Q: Find my mac tracking Does the \"Find My Mac\" app automatically notify you every time your Mac is turned on?

I am dealing with a user that is going on vacation, the user has a external HDD hooked up to a Mac Pro that will be locked (not sleep) while the user is gone. This HDD is shared with a team that accesses it regularly. \nShould we be able to leave the drive connected for a week without users losing the ability to see the drive on the network? The Mac Pro is currently set to not go to sleep. However, I don't know if locked for a period of time will sleep kick in. Is this not even really a concern if the sleep settings are disabled?\n\nA: There are a few things I'd do to minimise the possibility of an interruption while your colleague is away. You may already have these done, but just to be sure I go into detail below.\nScreensaver\nTotally disable your screensaver so that it's set to Never. \nEnergy Saver\nEnsure that both Display Sleep and Computer Sleep are also set to Never.\nEnable the Start up automatically after power failure and the Restart automatically if the computer freezes options (although if the Mac Pro doesn't automatically login then someone would need to know the password in order to log in - see Users & Groups below).  \nNOTE: \nYou can use Terminal to confirm these settings by entering the:\nsudo systemsetup -getrestartfreeze -getrestartpowerfailure command.\nUsers & Groups\nIf the user requires a password to login you will need to address the possibility that in the event of a freeze or power failure, no-one will be able to log in while they're away. One option would be to temporarily ensure that Automatic Login is not off so you don't hit any surprises on reboots.\nTo do this go to Login Options and enable Automatic Login.  \nIMPORTANT: If you're worried about security, it may be best to create another user on the Mac Pro for periods such as this and use that user account to share the HD etc. Then, when the user is away on vacation etc, all you need to do is set the machine to automatically log in for this user account instead. (Keep in mind this is just an added precaution in the event of a power failure or freeze.)\nAlso within Users & Groups is the option to have items automatically open upon logging in. So, if you require the Mac Pro to have any particular software running, then you'll want to ensure this is set as a login item. Again, this is just an added protection in the event the Mac Pro reboots for some reason.\nTo access login items, select the user and click on the Login Items tab. Use the plus + button to add items as necessary.\nApp Store\nDuring the vacation period it would probably also be good to ensure that no software updates are automatically installed (as some require the computer to restart - hence causing the same issue as a power failure/freeze because of the subsequent reboot).\nGo to System Preferences > App Store and uncheck the Automatically check for updates option.\nLast resort\nIf all else fails and you run into problems during the vacation period, don't forget you can just shutdown the Mac Pro and then manually connect the external HDD to other computers for users to access as necessary.\n", "Q: How to configure a complex launchd CalendarInterval?

This is a bit frustrating (probably because I've only used it for 2 days), so I opened System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and tried to change the shortcut to Shift + Command and for some reason it refuses to change. \nI tried to test some other shortcuts such as Command + Z and it works fine. I'd still like to change it to Shift + Command. Is there a way I can achieve this?\n\nA: With macOS' system shortcuts you can't set keyboards shortcuts solely using modifier keys.\nYou need to specify an additional (non-modifier) key for macOS to accept and save your shortcut.\nSierra does have an extra setting (in system prefs/keyboard/input sources) for switching between certain keyboards via Caps Lock alone, but that does not help solve your problem.\n\nA: Punto Switcher can do it. This utility helps with language auto toggling but you can disable this behaviour and just set desired key binding. I think it doesn't have UI other than Russian, but you will surely be able to configure it intuitively.\n\nA: I use CommandShift. It's a free and open-source app which \"allows you to change input source using Windows-style shortcut (e.g. Command + Shift, Option + Shift, Control + Shift or Fn + Shift)\"\nSounds like what you're looking for =)\n\nA: I also faced with this issue, so created a small tray application that will remap the default shortcut to Ctrl+Shift or Cmd+Shift:\n\nHere is a link to the GitHub.\n\nA: With freshest version (11.4.0 at 13.12.2017) of Karabiner Elements and Cmd + e for previous language source:\n\nYou can put this json gist to ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/<filename>.json, add gist rule in Karabiner Elements Preferences -> Complex Modifications -> Rules -> Add rule and Enable Languages -> Command + Shift to Command + e.\n\nThis will remap Cmd + Shift to Cmd + e and you can change language source by Cmd + Shift.\n\nA: The best way to change the way to shift between languages from the default is as follows:\nOpen System Preferences and tap Keyboard:\n\nThen tap Shortcuts, then from the side list tap \"Input Sources\", then \"Select Next Source\":\n\n*Note you will have to choose something like CNTRL-SHIFT-1 or another key combo than shift-space, but you can play around with it and find a combo that works for you.\nEdit: If you want to do what you want by only pressing control shift, you might be able to do that by creating an applescript which toggles the languages and using a 3rd party hot key app on the appstore. I don't advise this, but it would be conceivably possible. For the sake of convenience, I have attached such an applescript that you can use for this purpose where if you map say control shift to this applescript, it will execute the CMD space code (or you can change it another code which doesn't conflict with spotlight (my personal recommendation):\ntell application id \"com.apple.systemevents\"\nkeystroke (key code 49 using command down)\nend tell\n\n", "Q: how to use hpn ssh with sftp command I've installed hpn ssh using this command:\nsudo port install openssh +hpn\n\nI want to transfer lost data (100GB at least) using sftp command terminal command.\nI am wondering, is installing hpn ssh all I need to do to gain speed advantage with sftp command? After installing hpn ssh, my current upload speed is around 1.8MB (i have a line of 2.5 MB, so that is pretty close). Sadly, I didn't do a test before installing it. stupid me\nAlso, I noticed that transferring lots of individual files takes a lot more time than transferring 1 big file. Is zipping all the files and than sending that 1 zip the recommended way of transfering to remote host? I would prefer the option to not zip the files first, since zipping 100GB takes some time.\nIf you know a better solution to transfer large amount of data to remote host, I am open to it:) \n\nA: MacPorts would install sftp in /opt/local/bin/. You can test against the OS installed /usr/bin/sftp.\nThe OS installed zip uses gzip compression by default but can be configured to use bzip2 (with the -Z option) which should give you better compression. I would split the 100GB of files into smaller archives.\nNext, consider using tar or xar to create your archives. tar with xz should give you the best compression,xz should already be installed by MacPorts. Of course these suggestions depend upon the tools available on the remote host.\n", "Q: New Mail client does not keep correct coloring of mail I recently upgraded from Mavericks to Sierra. The new Mail client bugs me: My main problem is a change in the way it sends clipboard copies of what was in the Terminal app.\nPreviously, when I sent a clipboard copy of my terminal in the old Mavericks Mail client, it kept the original formatting (i.e. the white characters on black background copied from within the terminal) and when somebody received it, it was as I sent it (i.e. white on black). This was a very convenient way to show what was copied from the terminal. \nNow with Sierra's mail client, the background is changed to white so that the white text cannot be seen by the recipient. This happens even though at my end it looks fine (i.e. white characters on a black background).\nHow can I keep the original formatting as I copy it into Mail, so that when it's sent it is received at the other end still showing the black background?\n\nA: The problem was with the transparency of the terminal window. The formatting kept the transparency value but the recipients' mail client could not handle this information. \nI duplicated my terminal profile and set the background opacity to 100% and marked the new profile under Copy special to use that.\n\n\nNow it works as I wanted\n", "Q: Is Thunderbolt on the same bus as FireWire and Ethernet on a late 2012 Mac Mini I use a late 2012 Mac Mini as a music server.

I am proposing to use a TB/FW adapter. \nAny suggestions please.\n\nA: \nAfter a lightning strike the Mac Mini FireWire and Ethernet ports do\n  not work.\n\nThe Mac mini got hit by lightening and still functions?  I am surprised that you only lost two ports\n\nIs it likely that the Thunderbolt port is also burnt out.\n\nLikely, but it's  impossible to tell from this distance.  To know for certain, you need to plug in a device to test functionality.\n\nI am proposing to use a TB/FW adaptor.\n\nThis sounds like an excellent idea.  If you plug it in and it works/doesn't work then you have your diagnosis.    \nThe only other suggestion other than trying things to see if it works is to run Apple Hardware Test (AHT).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.  \nHowever, it sounds like you lost some key functionality when the Ethernet port died.  It's probably a good time to take it in for service or upgrade to a newer model.\nOn a side note, a good (and cheap) bit of insurance is to get a UPS Back-Up Power Supply with surge protection.  I personally use CyberPower UPSs on all my Apple gear (APC everywhere else) because they are compatible with macOS.  \nSpeaking from personal experience...in 25+ years in IT in the lightning capital of the US (Florida), I have been hit by lightning twice and never lost a single piece of gear.

At this point, ICloud is installed and operating, but the windows installer hangs and requires a reboot if any install or uninstall is needed.  After a reboot, ICloud is automatically uninstalled.  I have tried all fixes recommended on the web, but nothing works.\n\nA: I was told by a Microsoft technician that if your computer had Windows 10 installed as a virtual copy to your computer as opposed to having the physical install disc and installing from disc then the iCloud installation cannot remove the the backup files as they don't exist in reality, they only exist in the virtual copy of the program.

But they are transformed to movie format on QT Player 10.4 on a New Mac.\nHow can I repair/avoid this ?\n\nA: QuickTime VR hasn't been used for at least 10 or 11 years so it's going to be really difficult to find a current player for this file format.  There's likely no path to remedy this.\nEven on Apple's website, it's listed as \"legacy/historical\".  This piece of documentation was updated in 2009 - 8 long years ago.\nFrom a 2016 Business Insider Article:  The inside story of Apple's forgotten project to change how we explore the world from our computers\n\nWhen Steve Jobs returned to Apple, QuickTime VR was de-emphasized. Apple put out its last QuickTime VR-specific press release in 1997, although Apple continued to use it to provide 360-degree views of new products like iPods as late as 2006. \"Quicktime VR all really happened in that Scully window before Steve came back, and I think that Apple does not pay any attention to the stuff that happened during those years,\" Bohrman said. \n\nThere may be some open source or 3rd party applications that support it, but going off Wikipedia, the list is quite small.  \n\nA: You need to install QuickTime Player 7 for Mac OS X v10.6.3 or later from this link:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/dl923\nI can confirm that I can still interact with my QTVR files, both panoramas and Object Movies in macOS Sierra.\n", "Q: I've manually copied files from my time machine backup drive and now I cannot delete them from my computer I got a new computer and I didn't want to do a full time machine restore but rather pick and choose what files I was going to copy off of my time machine drive.\nSo, I went into the directory, found some files I want, and did cp -Rpv dir /Users/username/dir\nHowever, With the -P it kept the same permissions as the files on the time machine. chmod -R 777 dir doesn't work and neither does resetting permissions from within the 'get info' -> 'sharing and permissions' setting.\nHow can I get the permissions for the directory back to something that will allow me to delete the directory?\n\nA: I've sorted it out.

How can I prevent lost commands? I use OS X 10.10.5.\n\nA: The history size is controlled by the variables HISTFILESIZE and HISTSIZE (see man bash).

I used to use Karabiner to remap Right Alt to Right Control (as an Emacs user I use Control MUCH more that Alt) but updating to Sierra broke this.  Downgrading is not an option.\nHow do I manually remap keys in Sierra?  I specifically would like to remap Right Alt to Right Control.\n\nA: Apple's Technical Note TN2450 describes how to remap keys.  Running the following command will remap Right Alt to be Right Control.  \nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":\n    [{\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x7000000e6,\n      \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x7000000e4}]\n}'\n\nNote that the above command is not switching the Right Alt and Right Control.  They will both be Right Control.  If you have a MacBook, you will not notice this until plugging in an external keyboard.  If you want to switch Right Alt and Right Control, you need to add a second switch command, like the following.\nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":\n    [{\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x7000000e4,\n      \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x7000000e6},\n     {\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x7000000e6,\n      \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x7000000e4}]\n}'\n\nThe table at the bottom of the Technical Note has a list of hex values for each key.  To generalize the above answer to switch any keys, you must or the hex value from that list together with 0x700000000.  The following Python code demonstrates one way to do this.\nIn [1]: def convert(val):\n   ...:     int_val = int(val, 16)\n   ...:     int_ref = 0x700000000\n   ...:\n   ...:     return hex(int_ref | int_val)\n   ...:\n\nIn [2]: r_alt = '0xE6'\n\nIn [3]: print(convert(r_alt))\n0x7000000e6\n\n\nA: A more general and user-friendly approach is to use Karabiner-Elements, which is a version of Karabiner that works on Sierra.\n\nA: This is an addendum to Steven C. Howell's answer.\nI have a new MacBook Pro with a Scandinavian keyboard. This new model no longer has an Esc key, which is a significant handicap for me.\nI discovered that the following will translate the § key (upper left, left of 1 and above tab key) - which I don't think I have ever used for anything before today - to produce Esc.\nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[{\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x700000064,\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x700000029}]}'\n\nIn Apple's documentation (linked from Steven's answer) this is labelled as \"Keyboard Non-US \\ and |\" (0x64).\nSeveral of the \"non-US\" keys are hard to discover because they typically refer to keys which have a different label on the keyboard you are using. (I also discovered that \"Grave accent and tilde\" refers to the key between left shift and z, which on my keyboard produces <. I was unable to establish which key corresponds to \"Non-US # and ~\" and did not experiment further once I found my key.) If you want to experiment, try running the script in the terminal until you find the key you need:\nfor ((i=1;i<=128;++i)); do\n    printf '0x7000000%0x\\n' \"$i\"\n    printf '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[{\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x7000000%0x,\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x70000000a}]}' \"$i\" |\n    xargs -0 hidutil property --set >/dev/null\n    read -p \"Type some stuff: \"\n    hidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[{}]}' >/dev/null\ndone\n\nThis loops over the keycodes and changes one at a time, in the hope that you can find through trial and error a key which is not particularly useful  for you.  Try typing something when it asks you to -- if you get a g instead of what you expected, you have found the right key code.

The LG Magic Remote is a strange beast, because by default, the signals it sends to LG TVs tend not to be picked up by other IR controls (I don't know if that means it's communicating some other way, or whether the IR frequency it uses is really unusual). As a result, the Apple TV's \"Learn Remote\" functionality does not work straight away when operating the LG Magic Remote.\nNevertheless, there is a feature of the LG TV to configure its remote to serve as the universal remote of various inputs (i.e. select DVD player on HDMI 2, pick a make, verify it works, and then the remote will start sending IR signals whenever HDMI 2 is active).\nThe Apple TV is officially not supported by LG (per their phone support) and Apple does appear as a valid make when selecting a remote type. So I figured based on googling, that if I picked any nonsense DVD player, the remote would at least start sending IR signals that could be learned using the Apple TV \"Learn Remote\" feature.\nThose linked threads report success, but in fact their advice of \"rapidly mash buttons\" for the Apple TV to learn the IR signal didn't work in my case, and I suspect it's a function of the newest 2017 version of the remote (I'm testing on an LG OLED65C7P). I've tried a dozen different \"set top box\" and \"dvd/blu ray\" device types, and in each case the IR signal for the arrow buttons is not strong enough for the Apple TV to register them at all.\nAny ideas on how to overcome this?\n\nA: I found a really gross workaround.\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy a learning universal remote. I used this old thing\n\n*After selecting any \"DVD/Bluray\" make from the LG TV UI, have the learning remote learn the keys you want to use for ⬆️\n\n*With both remotes, sit by the Apple TV and hold and/or mash that key. After a dozen or so tries the Apple TV should eventually fill its progress bar and accept it.\n\n*Repeat for ,⬇️,⬅️,➡️, OK, and Menu. Note that the button in the center of the magic remote and most settings buttons around it are not programmable, so I had to settle for \"O\" to mean \"OK\" and \"8\" to mean \"Menu\"\n\n\nNot ideal, but better than nothing. LG Magic Remote now works fine for navigating the Apple TV\n\nA: For me, this was working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the Apple TV is not assigned a specific device in the Input Manager app. Delete it if it has one.\n\n*Turn off the LG TV's Quickstart mode.\n\n*Turn off the Simplink mode which turns off the device (Apple TV) when TV power is turned off.\n\n*Set the Apple TV to never go into standby.\n\n*Use the LG TV Magic Remote to turn on the TV.\nSource\n\nA: I got mine to work by activating HDMI-CEC on the \nTV (I have an E7), but with Apple TV I have found if I leave it too long and go back and see the Apple Ariel screensaver is on, the remote becomes unresponsive and you can’t get back to the Apple TV menu main screen.

I regularly use an iPhone 5 to record video of lectures and tutorials. \nIf I transfer the videos to an OTG flash drive, and delete them from iPhone storage, is it possible to play them again (while the flashdrive is connected to the iPhone)?\nIs there any app I need to be download beforehand?\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, OTG flash drives come in either microUSB or USB Type-C versions. \nAs no past or current model of iPhone or iPad natively support these connections, it's unlikely that OTG flash drives will bundle the software and adapter needed to be used by your iPhone. That's because iOS itself would require specific apps to allow data to be accessed from an external device, and also because it'd need to support a Lightning port connection in some way.\nThe only options I've seen that would allow you to do what you want, are custom designed solutions specifically targeting iOS devices. For example, there are iPhone cases that include storage and an app to allow the iPhone to use that storage. Likewise there are specific flash drives that do the same.\nBelow are three examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mophie Space Pack\n\n*SanDisk iExpand Flash Drive\n\n*Lexar microSD Reader\nNOTE: I have not personally used any of these devices - I list them purely as examples of what I'm referring to.\n\nA: I would like to flesh out my comment to an answer.  \nThe key issue is that iOS as (opposed to Android) does not intend the usage of external media.  Though it seems Apple is not too stringent about since they even produce a SD reader, based on which all devices that connect to USB are constructed.\nThe intended use for these devices is to import photos and videos into iPhoto.  This isn't a decent player for longer videos.  Note - that you especially are not supposed to copy videos into the videos app. But there are plenty superior players around anyway - like VLC.\nThere is a number of third party apps that will offer you transfer from iOS apps to external and back.  But so far the options to use data from storage directly are very limited - it's usually transfer to phone first, and then open locally.  Even the very flexible VLC is unable to use external storage.  Though among the examples @Monomeeth found the iExpand claims to come with an app that plays videos.  Personally I would be wary, as one is stuck with the video player provided.\nA bit more promising are the drives with builtin WiFi - like this Sandisk Connect Wireless Stick.  This sounds rather cumbersome but the nice thing is you are freer in the selection of apps.  In addition to the provided app there usually is a web interface through which media can be viewed/streamed.  The way videos are provided is very commons so you can find a selection of video players.\n", "Q: Can I group received emails in Sierra?

I have an AppleScript .scpt file, triggered by a key combination in FastScripts.app, that functions as a thesaurus. The script looks up the selected word in a pre-formatted list, and, if the word is found in this list, it displays the synonyms of this word to the user1.\nThis list is contained in a plain text (.txt) file. The list is already formatted in the AppleScript list format. I would like my .scpt file to be able to accept this text as a true list2.\nIt is important to note that the .txt file contains 2.5 million words3.\nThis is why I am not simply copying the contents of the .txt file into the .scpt file itself, despite the fact that the text file is 100% static and will never be altered. Inserting the text directly into my script would bring with it considerable lag and sluggishness as I edit and compile my .scpt file in Script Editor.app.\nScript Editor.app froze every time that I tried to read the .txt file. The problem is that Script Editor reads into the memory a given text file in its entirety, instead of streaming the contents in a more efficient manner. So, I broke this text file up into 10 smaller text files4, each new .txt file containing about 250,000 words.\nAt 250,000 words, of course, the text files are still extremely large (by any standard).\nHere is a (severely condensed) example of what the contents of each text file looks like:\n\n{{\"exaltation\",\"accolade\",\"adulation\",\"advance\",\"advancement\"},{\"exalted\",\"winnowing\",\"winsome\"},{\"exam\",\"audition\",\"blue book\",\"examen\",\"examination\",\"final\",\"examination\",\"test\",\"trial\",\"tripos\",\"viva\",\"written\",\"written examination\"},{\"examination\",\"Pap test\",\"Socratic method\",\"airing\",\"analysis\",\"anatomic diagnosis\",\"appraisal\",\"work-up\",\"written\",\"written examination\"},{\"examine\",\"air\",\"analyze\",\"appraise\",\"archetype\",\"asleep\",\"assess\",\"canvass\",\"case\"},{\"examiner\",\"analyst\",\"analyzer\",\"asker\"},{\"examining\",\"analytic\",\"examinational\",\"exploratory\"},{\"example\",\"admonishment\",\"admonition\",\"alarm\",\"archetype\"},{\"exasperate\",\"bedevil\",\"vex\",\"work up\",\"worry\"},{\"exasperated\",\"aggravated\",\"amplified\",\"angry\",\"annoyed\"},{\"exasperating\",\"annoying\",\"bothering\",\"bothersome\"}}\n\nAs you can see, the contents of the text file is a nested list5 that is organized in the same way that AppleScript formats a list. Each text file contains no line breaks or paragraphs.\nI am looking for a method to get this list into my AppleScript, with as little latency as possible6. This is why I pre-formatted it. So, speed is key.\n\nFootnotes:\n1. My thesaurus script is similar to the built-in thesaurus feature that exists in Microsoft Word. One notable difference is that my script works system-wide.\n2. By true list, I mean that I can call, for example, item 12 of this list later on in my AppleScript.\n3. My source for the thesaurus data is Grady Ward's \"Moby\" Thesaurus. I found this database from this answer: Looking for Thesaurus Data - Stack Overflow\n4. I had to use Hex Fiend.app to cut from the text file and paste into a new text file. I could not edit the file in TextEdit.app, without TextEdit freezing on me.\n5. The outer list contains each thesaurus entry. The inner lists contain all of the synonyms for that entry. The first item of each inner list is the entry title. Both the outer list and each inner list are ordered alphabetically (with the exception of the first word of each inner list, because, again, this word is the entry title).\n\n6. I understand that even the fastest method will still have several seconds of latency, since the text file is so large.\n\n\nA: Obviously, I do not know the total scope of what you're doing or how you have other things coded, as you have not supplied all the details and code, however, I would take a different approach.\nI downloaded the Moby Thesaurus from the linked page in your question and preformed the following actions on it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Extracted the contents of the mthes.tar.Z file.\n\n*Opened the ./mthes/mobythes.aur file in TextWrangler and noticed two things to change.\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the line endings from Classic Mac (CR) to Unix (LF).\n\n*Removed unwanted trailing commas from 6 lines.\n\n\n\nNote that while I could make these changes in TextWrangler, nonetheless I prefer to use Terminal, and did so using the following command:\ntr \"\\r\" \"\\n\" < mobythes.aur | sed -E 's/[,]{1,}$//' > mobythes.txt\n\nWhich took but literally a second to do (as I actually prefaced the above command with time, out of curiosity). With the mobythes.aur file having now been processed, saved to mobythes.txt and copied to my Documents folder, I will use this new plain CSV file as is, to query the search string for a match to the first field of each record and return the record, sans the first field, as a list to choose from in AppleScript. I found this method to be extremely fast, while searching for \"zoom\" the last record in the CSV file, it took but a second to return and create the list for that record on the fly.\nIn AppleScript Editor I use the following code to test against the plain CSV file as a single file containing the 30,260 lines with 2.5 million synonyms and related words.\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\nset theMobyThesaurus to POSIX path of (path to documents folder) & \"mobythes.txt\"\n\nset theSearchString to the text returned of (display dialog \"Find synonyms for:\" default answer \"\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"Search\"} default button 2 with title \"Search Moby Thesaurus\")\n\nif theSearchString is not equal to \"\" then\n\n    try\n        set theSearchResults to (do shell script \"grep -i -m 1 '^\" & theSearchString & \",' \" & theMobyThesaurus)\n    on error\n        display dialog \"No match for \\\"\" & theSearchString & \"\\\" available.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n        return\n    end try\n\n    if theSearchResults is not equal to \"\" then\n        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \",\"\n        set theSynonymsList to items 2 thru -1 of text items of theSearchResults as list\n        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\n\n        choose from list theSynonymsList with prompt \"Choose a synonym for: \" & linefeed & theSearchString\n        if the result is not false then\n            set theChosenWord to (item 1 of the result)\n        end if\n    end if\n\nend if\n\nIn this example, assuming a search match was made and nothing canceled, then the theChosenWord variable now contains what was chosen from the displayed list and can be processed further as needed/wanted.\nNote that this is of course strictly example code for testing purposes and will need to be adapted to your use case scenario while incorporating appropriate error handling as needed.\nI believe this is going to be the fastest way while leaving the Moby Thesaurus as a single CSV file, and is probably faster then whatever methods you tried thus far.\n\nA: I had devised a solution before user3439894 had posted their answer.\nDespite the fact that user3439894's solution is superior to my solution in every way, I figure that I may as well post my code, if for no other reason than to highlight the fast response time of user3439894's solution. \n\nFile adjustments:\nHere are the two modifications that I made to the source file, mobythes.aur, for my solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*I converted the .aur file to a .txt file, simply by renaming the file extension in Finder.\n\n*I inserted (1) carriage return before the first character of the .txt file (just in case the user ever searches for the first thesaurus entry, i.e., a cappella).\nI realized that I was barking up the wrong tree in my original post—there is no need (or benefit, really) of pre-formatting the .txt file contents in AppleScript's list format, within the file itself. Hence, I did not modify the file's original delimiter structure whatsoever (in the way that I had done so in my original post).\n\nMy code:\ndisplay dialog \"Find synonyms of:\" default answer \"\"\nset theSearchQuery to text returned of the result\n\n-- Referencing the default delimiters of the \"mobythes.txt\" file:\nset theOuterListDelimiter_oneCarriageReturn to (ASCII character 13)\nset theInnerListDelimiter_oneComma to \",\"\n\nset theSearchQueryAsAThesaurusEntry to (theOuterListDelimiter_oneCarriageReturn & theSearchQuery & theInnerListDelimiter_oneComma)\n\nset theThesaurusAsString to (read POSIX file \"/Users/Me/Desktop/mobythes.txt\")\n\nif theThesaurusAsString contains theSearchQueryAsAThesaurusEntry then\n\n    set theSynonymsAsText to extractBetween(theThesaurusAsString, theSearchQueryAsAThesaurusEntry, theOuterListDelimiter_oneCarriageReturn)\n    set theSynonymsInList to splitStringIntoList(theSynonymsAsText, theInnerListDelimiter_oneComma)\n\n    choose from list theSynonymsInList\nelse\n    display dialog \"No thesaurus entry exists for \\\"\" & theSearchQuery & \"\\\"!\"\nend if\n\n\n-- Subroutines:\n\nto extractBetween(SearchText, startText, endText)\n    --  Source: http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=24725\n    set tid to AppleScript's text item delimiters -- save them for later.  \n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to startText -- find the first one.  \n    set endItems to text of text item -1 of SearchText -- everything after the first.  \n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to endText -- find the end one.  \n    set beginningToEnd to text of text item 1 of endItems -- get the first part.  \n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to tid -- back to original values.  \n    return beginningToEnd -- pass back the piece.  \nend extractBetween\n\non splitStringIntoList(theString, theDelimiter)\n    -- Source: http://erikslab.com/2007/08/31/applescript-how-to-split-a-string/\n    -- save delimiters to restore old settings:\n    set oldDelimiters to AppleScript's text item delimiters\n    -- set delimiters to delimiter to be used:\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to theDelimiter\n    -- create the array:\n    set theArray to every text item of theString\n    -- restore the old setting:\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDelimiters\n    -- return the result:\n    return theArray\nend splitStringIntoList\n\n\nRuntime performance comparison:\nOut of curiosity, I conducted a \"shoot-out\" of execution times between user3439894's approach and my approach.\nI commented out every dialog in both of our solutions.

This works well with my iPhone usually in the audio mode, but switches when calling or answering the phone.\nOn my Mac (macOS Sierra 10.12.4) they work as audio only.\nHow do I switch the headphones between modes?\nOn audio only they do not appear in the System Preferences -> Sound output.\nOn odd occasions I have made them appear in degraded audio and microphone mode by moving out of range and losing the connection and then moving back in range but this does not occur reliably. In this case the headphones do show up as a microphone in System Preferences.\n\nA: I do know that the degraded quality can be fixed by switching the Mic (Input device) to your Mac's mic rather than the headphone's mic. It's a software issue as far as I know.\n\nA: Just a couple of pointers for anyone with this issue: in general, the Bluetooth standard (as of version 4 or so) provides 2 codecs for use with headphones/headsets: SBC for high quality audio + high latency + no microphone, or SCO for lower audio quality + microphone + low latency. The point is that they don't provide for high audio quality + microphone at the same time, so at any given moment you have to choose one of the combinations.\nMacOS and iOS tend to switch to SBC when possible, meaning when the headset's microphone is not in use. So the first thing to try to get high quality audio is to switch to the computer's microphone in Sound preferences. And viceversa, if what you want is to use the microphone even if that means lower audio quality, select the headset's microphone in the Sound input prefs. Applications who use audio input (Zoom, QuickTime Player during recording) will usually do this for you.\nLatency is usually only important when doing interactive things, like playing a game or video calling. For plain video watching and such, the OS compensates the audio delay so one won't notice, so SBC is OK. But when low latency or microphone are needed, SBC is not an option.\nIf one cares for high quality audio + low latency, one usually needs to look into gear with specialist BT audio codecs: aptX and its variants are the most heard of. This is a bit of a rabbit hole so I won't go into that here.\nFor those knowing what they're doing, one can get a bit finer control of what the audio is doing in macOS with the included app \"Audio MIDI Setup\". Also, Bluetooth Explorer (one of the \"additional tools for XCode\") allows one to set some deeper details of audio/BT, like disabling/forcing codecs.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use Google Sheets filter views on IOS? I made a sheet in Google Sheets on the desktop with several filter views. Then I opened the sheet in the Google Sheets app on my iPhone. In the iPhone app menu, there is an option to create a filter, but I don't see any way to access my existing filter views. \nIs this possible?\n\nA: Google docs currently list this as not supported on iOS:\n\nNote: Filter views are only available on a computer. See the FILTER article for info about the function.\n\nSource:\nhttps://support.google.com/docs/answer/3540681?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en&oco=2\n\nA: Well you can use DESKTOP VERSION of the Google Sheet WEB APP on any mobile platform.\nJust open your google sheet in a browser, and switch to a desktop version for that page - you will get the FULL FUNCTIONALITY of Google Sheets on mobile.\nTIP: if you want to zoom the whole page, do this on some \"white area\" - the top bar with menu or the context menu (tap-and-hold) for example.\n\nA: Currently it doesn't seem to be supported.\n", "Q: I can not explain my disk usage I have a RAID 5 solution with 4 disks of 2TB. That gives me 6TB disk space. Now Disk Utility tells me that my actual usage is 3,5TB and I have 2.5TB free space. But when I add up the disk usage of the individual folders then this does add up to 2TB. So there is a gap of 1.5TB. \nI have deleted a very large folder recently. Could that explain it ? That disk utility is not reporting the actual situation ? \nEDIT: I have downloaded OmniDiskSweeper and this app gives this list of my disk group: \n\nSo my folders add up to 2.0TB. Here is the disk info that my MAC gives me:\n\nAs far as I can tell I see a difference of 1.5TB. I am no techie so I cannot explain this.\n\nA: First of all, empty your trash, reboot & try out disk utility again if you haven't already. If that doesn't do it though you'll have to dig a bit more.\nHere's the terminal command for finding hidden files & folders: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES. Put sudo in front of that if it doesn't work - you'll have to enter your user password in this case. Once you've done this restart finder by clicking the apple icon in the menu bar and heading into 'Force Quit...'.\nNow if you open Finder, select 'Go' & 'Computer' from the menu bar, go into the drive in question. I would put this into 'list' view and make sure that the size option is on. For any folders that aren't showing their size, highlight them (hold command + click to select multiple) and then hit command + i to pull up the Get Info menu for them. You'll see that under the size field they're 'Calculating Size'. Just keep those windows up & wait for them to finish - for the sizes you're dealing with this could take potentially hours. Add them up again & see if the size is accounted for.\nIf there's still 500gb or so missing I would recommend to backup & reinstall OS X. You can select only exactly what you want to using Time Machine, see the size before you even finish backing up, and then restore.\n\nA: Part of the issue is that there are different methods to calculate space.  I would first run Disk Utility on the RAID array to ensure that the file system structures are good (if they're not, you can get incorrect free space readings), then run OmniDiskSweeper (https://www.omnigroup.com/download/latest/OmniDiskSweeper) on the volume and check again.\n\nA: To find out about your actual disc usage by-folder, open a Terminal (Applications->Utilities->Terminal) and enter the following command\ncd /; du -cgd 1 . 2>/dev/null\n\nThe output will be a list of folder sizes (in GB) like this\n1   ./_CO2\n8   ./_film\n3   ./_ins\n23  total\n\nIf this does not add up, try\ncd /; sudo du -cgd 1 . 2>/dev/null\n\nand give your root password.\n", "Q: How to deal with duplicate file names when moving files in terminal? So I'm trying to move images of a specific dimension to another folder. But working with a huge number of files, the same filename once and a while presents itself. And I have been using this script:\n#!/bin/bash\ntargetDir=\"$HOME/Documents/pixx\"\n\nfind \"$targetDir\" -iname '*.jpg' -o -iname '*.png' -o -iname '*.bmp' -o -iname '*.jpeg' 2>/dev/null | \\\nwhile read -r filename; do\n    hw=\"$(sips -g pixelHeight -g pixelWidth \"$filename\" 2>/dev/null)\"\n    h=\"$(awk '/pixelHeight/{print $2}'<<<\"$hw\")\"\n    w=\"$(awk '/pixelWidth/{print $2}'<<<\"$hw\")\"\n    if [[ $h -eq 270 ]] && [[ $w -eq 360 ]]; then\n        mv \"$filename\" \"$targetDir/hehe\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nI found out that mv had a backup command mv --backup=t but that is just for linux, so I can't use that. But it would be great to have some sort of equal function in this script above.\nSo how can I add a incremental number if the same filename appears?\n\nA: If you are already a homebrew user, you could install GNU coreutils and get quick access to GNU mv. This is installed as gmv so that it doesn't break any scripts that rely on BSD mv's syntax.\nIf you don't use homebrew and do not want to install it, you'll need to do tests with [ -f ${filename} ] etc. (which I expect is what you wanted).\nOnce you have homebrew installed, run,\nbrew install fileutils\n\nThen you can gmv --backup=t as you wished to.\n\nA: This isn't that difficult to do. You need to test if the file exists in the target directory then add an increment to the file name and test if that name exists.\nReplace mv \"$filename\" \"$targetDir/hehe\" in your code with:\nbase=$filename##*/}     # same as using basename but\n                        # with parameter expansion\n\nif [ -e \"${targetDir}/hehe/${base}\" ]\nthen\n    echo \"File exists; $base needs to be renamed..\"\n    i=1                 # initialize the counter\n    shortname=${base%.*} # file name without extension\n    ext=${base##*.}     # the file extension\n\n    while [ -e \"${targetDir}/hehe/${shortname}_{$i}.${ext}\" ]\n    do\n        ((i++))\n    done\n\n    echo mv -- \"$filename\" \"${targetDir}/hehe/${shortname}_{$i}.${ext}\"\n\nelse\n    echo \"$base does not need renaming...\"\n    echo mv -- \"$filename\" \"$targetDir/hehe\" \nfi\n\nThis code will only echo the mv statements and will not rename any files. Please test thoroughly. If you are confident that output will give you the desired results then remove the echo in front of the mv statements.\n", "Q: Complete a movie download on different Wi-Fi I am downloading the movie Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

I have a lightning connector to USB-C I use for programming and development. \n\nWhat would happen if I plugged the USB-C end into my late 2016 Mac Book Pro power supply (87 W)?\n\n*Disclaimer, I already did it, and it works. It charges quickly, but not sure if it's safe to do going forward. \n\nA: It will charge. It's not dangerous. That power adapter is designed to supply UP TO 87W. If you plug a 15\" tbMBP into it, it will draw all 87W provided. If you plug a 13\" tbMBP into it, the MBP will only draw 61W, even though the adapter can provide 87W. Same for you iPhone. It will draw the amount of power it needs (~10W, IIRC), and the adapter has no problem providing only that amount of power.\nHowever, it is interesting to note that the USB plug adapters that come with iPhones provide only 5W, iPhones are capable of pulling more power, and will charge faster when plugged into an iPad (10W) or tbMBP USB plug adapter.\n\nA: It will work just fine and won't damage it.\nIt will charge your iPhone just fine with 2.1 Ampere until it reaches 80 % battery charge. After that point it will charge at a lower rate (also called \"trickle charge\").\nYour iPhone controls how much energy will be drawn, not the charger.\n\nYou'd get same behavior if you charge it\n\n\n*\n\n*connected to a MacBook Pro Retina (or newer) using a USB port\n\n*using the 2.1A/12W charger from the iPad\n", "Q: iMac boot issue I have a 2010 21.5 iMac.  During the boot-up I hear the chime and the fan is working but there's no display, only a black screen.\nI have tried the usual fixes (reset parameters, etc) but it doesn't make a difference. I have connected to a new iMac and tried the target disk mode, however that doesn't help.  \nI am wondering if it could be a logic board issue? \nIs there something else I can check or other troubleshooting I can do? \n\nA: It could be a logic board or a GPU (those GPUs are \"removable\")\nIf you are not seeing the grey screen, try booting in Verbose Mode (it will be a text boot).  \nIf you have another computer, trying pining the iMac.  If you don't know the IP address of your router, you can find it by finding it in the DHCP settings of your router (refer to your router manual for details).  If you can ping the iMac, then the chances are, it's your GPU.\nIf you can't ping it, then it's not booting and it's probably your logic board.\nIt's time to take it in for service.\n", "Q: Managing and sharing photos My wife is a prolific picture-taker, both on her iPhone 6 and her Nikon.

With iOS 10.3 Apple changed the mechanism for trusting a self-signed certificate. Before you simply just send the PEM file to your phone and it would install as a profile and the certificate would be trusted. Now that's no longer the case as even after installing the certificate, the cert is not trusted.\nEven when I use Apple Configurator to make a profile that trusts my cert, it still doesn't behave as trusted on the system.\nHow do I trust a self-signed certificate in iOS 10.3?\n\nA: I've identified that the specific parameter that Apple looks for when allowing you to manually trust a certificate is the CA Basic Constraint (E.G. critical,CA:true). If the certificate has this extension, the system will allow you to manually trust the certificate.\nHowever the process has one extra step (as opposed to iOS 9.3):\n\n*\n\n*Export the certificate as PEM format\n\n*Send the certificate to the device (Safari, Email, AirDrop, etc...) and open it\n\n*A message will appear telling you the profile has been downloaded. \n\n*Open the settings app and tap the \"Profile Downloaded\" item below your Apple ID row. \n\n*Install the Certificate. You will have to provide your devices passcode. \n\n*Navigate to Settings -> General -> About -> Certificate Trust Settings\n\n*Enable full trust for your certificate \n\nA: I solved it on mine on iOS 10.3 I had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all profiles.  (working phones didn't show a profile anyway)\n\n*Delete the offending POP account\n\n*Create a different POP account pointing to a different server\n\n*THEN you can open the server list and delete the offending outbound server.  That deletes the \"bad\" certificate apparently.  No other way to get to it because when you delete the single POP acocunt you lose visibility to the bad cert.\n\n*Once the bad server is removed, reboot to be sure\n\n*Rebuild the original POP account, it prompted me it was not trusted, gave me the opportunity to pick \"trust\"\n\n*Delete extra POP account to other server\n\n*fixed me.  No \"profile\" shown in settings.\n\n", "Q: Looking for information about the inner workings of Back to My Mac I'm looking for a source of information on the inner workings of Back to My Mac.

What I want is, how do I change the word osascript?\n\nA: The above methods all require administrator privileges in the first place, but if you are trying to do this as part of a bash script you want to distribute without requiring administrative privileges or extra setup, you could do something like the following:\nTMP=$(mktemp -d)\npushd \"$TMP\" > /dev/null 2>&1\n/usr/bin/osacompile -e 'do shell script \"echo hello args 2>&1 etc\" with administrator privileges' -o 'My Cool Name.app'\n'My Cool Name.app/Contents/MacOS/applet'\npopd\nrm -rf \"$TMP\"\n\nThis will create a temporary directory, compile the script as an applet, execute it and then delete the temporary directory and applet.\n\nA: I found a much better way of doing this, by digging through the Applescript doc on the Apple Developer's Site. I found this release note for  Applescript in MacOS 10.10\nIt says:\ndo shell script can now specify a custom prompt to use in the password dialog. [15194980]\n\nHowever, it neglects to say how you can do that. After some guesswork, I figured out that there's a prompt clause that lets you replace osascript wants to make changes... with whatever you want when using do shell script...with administrator privileges in a script invoked by osascript.  For example:\nosascript -e 'do shell script \"ls -l\" with prompt \"The Great And Powerful OZ \" with administrator privileges'\n\ngenerates a dialog box that looks like:\n\nI hope this helps someone.\n\nA: Assuming either El Capitan or Sierra is installed, first disable SIP and boot to your main system again.\nOpen Terminal and enter:\nsudo ln /usr/bin/osascript /usr/bin/butterfly\n\nEnable SIP again.\nNow butterfly will ask to make changes after entering\n/usr/bin/butterfly -e 'do shell script \"echo hello args 2>&1 etc\" with administrator privileges'\n\nInstead of butterfly you can use almost any other name. The name shouldn't be the name of an executable already existing on your Mac (especially it mustn't be one already existing in your PATH).\nSo ls or diskutil is a big NoNo but necyria_bellona is OK.\n\nThis doesn't work for APFS volumes (High Sierra and later) , because hard links don't exist in this file system.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use a Mac Pro as four different PC's simultaneously using the multiple display output Wondering if it would be possible to take the following Mac Pro...\nMac Pro 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5\nOriginally released December 2013\n3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5\n16GB memory\n1 TB PCIe-based flash storage\nDual AMD FirePro D700 graphics processors with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each\n...and have it run 4 displays and use each display independently of the other - thinking of partitioning the drive into 4 250gb sectors and running 4 copies of Parallels and 4 copies of Windows (i.e. 4 Windows virtual machines).  \nCould they all run simultaneously?  Would you just need to do it off a single non partitioned disk?  If so - how to assign a copy of windows/paralells/mouse and keyboard to each monitor and be able to run and use them simultaneously?\n\nA: Yes, this is possible to do. However, you will probably find that you'll need a lot more than 16GB RAM to make this practical. \n16GB RAM is more than enough to simultaneously run macOS and a virtual machine. But in your case you're wanting to run macOS and four virtual machines. Remember that you will need to allocate both RAM and VRAM to your virtual machine from the 16GB of RAM you have on board.\nMy recommendation would be that you have a minimum of 32GB RAM installed so as to make the setup workable. Ideally, you'd install more than that. Officially Apple supports 64GB RAM in these machines, however users have found that they work just as reliably with 128GB RAM installed.\nIf I was going to do this, I'd actually have 64GB RAM installed and probably share one of the VMs with a Bootcamp installation. However, that's just a suggestion.\nEither way, you only need to install Parallels once and then use it to create 4 virtual machines. If you do share one of these with a Bootcamp installation, then you'd obviously need a partition for that, but otherwise there's no need for multiple partitions.\nIn terms of the four displays, you would just move your VMs around to assign each of them to a different screen.\nFinally, since you're using Parallels, you could even use it in 'Coherence' mode so you can have any app you're running on any of the screens without having to worry about which VM was running it.\n", "Q: Wifi network option is not showing up I have a problem with my Wifi driver. I get the message  Wi-Fi: No Hardware Installed, which is like the one described here: Wi-Fi: No Hardware Installed\nI followed all the instructions given on that page, and from other sites including Apple support. Finally, I tried to remove Wifi from the system preferences and add it back. Unfortunately, adding back a network has no option for Wifi.\nI tried networksetup -setairportpower airport on as well. This gives me an error of: You cannot set Wi-Fi power because all AirPort network services are disabled. Any help will be deeply appreciated.\nEDIT:\n\nI updated an screenshot with Wifi not displayed in the wifi setup in system utility.\nI tried these approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple hardware test (Short term): No issues found.\n\n*Login in safe mode and then reboot, check system preferences same issue.\n\n*Downgraded to OSX El Capitan (I thought there might be some issue with the upgrade), but the same issue still existed.\n\n*Again upgraded to OSX Sierra but the issue persisted.\n\n\nOne thing I noticed, when booting from USB, There were no errors like Wi-Fi: No Hardware Installed but the spinner was continuously moving and searching for the networks and it had blank dropdown (without any results). My router was on and WiFi for other devices on the network.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires quite a bit of patience. Let's proceed as follows.\nHave you followed Allan's advice?\nI'm assuming you've already booted into Safe Mode and used Apple Hardware Test (as suggested by Allan in his comment on May 11)? \n\n\n*\n\n*If you haven't, then please follow the steps below for booting into Safe Mode and Running Apple Hardware Test.\n\n*If you have, can you please edit your question to provide the results of performing both actions. Then skip the steps below for performing these actions and try the Terminal commands I suggest.\n\n\nRun Apple Hardware Test\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nTake a note of the result and report back.\nNote 1: The extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. do you see the Wi-Fi option in System Preferences > Network?)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Check System Preferences > Network again\n\n\nOnce you've booted into Safe Mode, let us know how you went.\nNow, assuming you still have the problem after already booting into Safe Mode and running Apple Hardware Test, let's proceed with the following course of action.\nRun these Terminal commands\nLet's confirm what macOS believes the status of your Wi-Fi service is. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal\n\n*Enter the following command:\nsudo networksetup -listallnetworkservices\n\n*Press Enter\n\n*Enter your password (note you will not see the cursor move, nor the characters appear on the screen)\n\n\nNow, in the list that appears I assume you will see an asterisk (*) next to the Wi-Fi service. This denotes that it is currently disabled. Assuming this is what happens, let's try enabling it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you're still in Terminal\n\n*Enter the following command:\nnetworksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled Wi-Fi on\n\n*A popup will prompt you for your password - enter it and click on the Modify Configuration button \n\n*Now enter this command:\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Now check System Preferences > Network again\n\n\nLet me know how you go.\n\nA: Can you specify which Mac model & year you're using? \nI suspect that this is a hardware issue that needs repaired. These steps will tell if you that's the case.\nFirst try an SMC Reset. You'll find the instructions for this here and an NVRAM reset, instructions here.\nThen boot into Recovery Mode by holding CMD + R during startup. This is going to take a bit longer than it normally would to boot - let it run it's course even if takes around 15 minutes.\nIf the wifi doesn't work there either even after an NVRAM/SMC reset you can be confident that it's a hardware issue. Recovery Mode is overlooked a lot of times as a test bed but it's essentially another installation of OS X that's never been touched or modified, so if it persists you can be sure it's not caused by a faulty kext/program you might've installed.\nIf the issue is resolved in Recovery it was either by the SMC/NVRAM reset (in which case it will be resolved altogether) or there's an application in your user account causing it, where Safe Mode or creating a new test account in System Preferences > Users & Groups are good next troubleshooting steps.\n\nA: Had the same issues here with no WiFi hardware found, or could not switch WiFi on. WiFi card MAC address showed up in System. Very frustrating\nIt turned out to be a bad WiFi card. Changed that out and everything came back to normal. \nSometimes the most obvious answer is the correct one\n\nA: The same symptom happened to me just now - “WiFi: no hardware installed”. Turns out it was just a corrupted file, not an actual hardware failure. To make your WiFi come back to life, you need to remove \"/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\" as in drag it to the trash.  To find this guy, open a Finder window.  Then go to the menu bar for Finder and select \"Go\" and then \"Go to Folder\".  Then enter \"/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\" in the dialog box and click \"Go\" button.  Inside the folder that appears you will find \"com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\".  Drag \"com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\" to the trash.  A few seconds later, it will magically resurrect itself and the little WiFi symbol in the header area comes back all on its own.  You may need to select the correct WiFi network to connect to, but all is good again.\n", "Q: How to specify what dictionaries should be used by click and press on trackpad?

However, the app fails to copy the image URL to the clipboard on my system, and it doesn't support anonymous upload like ImageShareUr does (did), which I always thought was a great feature.\nAnother app is iPic, also for free on the MAS, but you need to buy the Pro license (in-app purchase) to get imgur support.

Currently there are two partitions on the SSD.\n\nHow can I remove the partitions? I want to have just one partition on the device.\nI have searched through Samsung's website but I cannot find any related software to download (including the driver)\n\nA: You don't need any additional software or drivers, not that I am aware of. You can do everything via disk utility. Please backup your data before performing this (by this I mean actually copying your files onto some other media or the cloud).\nPlease note: The method will vary for different macOS versions, as in the position and labeling of the icons are possibly different but the functionality should remain the same.\nThe steps given below are for macOS Sierra. Warning: Wall of text incoming.\nYour disk utility interface should look similar to this (except the options on the top bar shouldn't be grayed out):\n\nNext, you need to select the whole disk in the column on the left. As you can see in the image above (look at the column on the left), the volumes are stacked under the actual disks and are indented slightly to the right. You need to select the disk, and not the volumes. Your disk should be labeled \"Samsung Portable SSD T1 Media\" from what I can see in the given image.\nNext, navigate to the bar on the top and click erase. There you should get a confirmation message, for which you should select the option \"Erase\". This is immediately followed by a window with a field for the name you want to give the disk, and two dropdowns - one for which format you want to use, and one for which scheme you want to use.\nHere you need to make a decision. You can name the disk whatever you want, obviously. But as for the format you need to consider your use-case. Are you going to be using this disk only for Macs? Or are you also going to plug it in to Windows and Linux machines? Actually, Linux machines can also read Mac OS extended, but I digress.\nIf your use-case is the former, then you should just go with the default options it gives you which should be - Format: Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and Scheme: GUID Partition Map. If not, change it to that.\nIf your use-case is the latter, then you should change the format to exFAT and let the scheme be GUID Partition Map.\nYou don't really need to change the scheme unless you plan to make the media bootable.

Where are the Core Storage instructions stored?\nIn Kevin White's macOS Support Essentials 10.12, White says\n\nThe second partition, occupying the final ~650 MB of the disk is an \"Apple_Boot\" formatted volume that contains the Recovery HD system. Aside from providing macOS Recovery functionality, this second partition is intentionally not managed by Core Storage, since it provides the software necessary for a Mac computer's ... firmware to understand Core Storage volumes.\n\nIf a Mac doesn't have a Recovery HD volume, is it not eligible for Core Storage? \nWill FileVault work? and if so, how does it support encryption during use?\n\nA: Starting up from a core storage volume -- whether encrypted or not -- requires a non-Core-Storage volume to hold the booter file. There's some coverage of this in reference section 26.1 of the Support Essentials book, and also a bit in section 9.1 where it talks about Core Storage and Fusion Drive.\nWhat happens during startup is that the firmware loads a booter file, which then loads the kernel (and kext cache) and starts that off. The firmware doesn't know how to deal with Core Storage (whether or not it's encrypted), so the booter has to be located on a plain Mac OS Extended volume. The booter is then responsible for mounting the Core Storage volume (including unlocking it if it's encrypted) so that it can load and start the kernel.\n\n\n*\n\n*For a plain (non-CS) startup volume, the booter is located on the main\nvolume (at /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi).\n\n*For a CS-with-Recovery-partition setup, the booter will be located on the Recovery HD volume (along with the necessary info to present the FileVault unlock screen and unlock the main volume). In this case, the Recovery HD volume actually has two (or possibly more) booter files, one set up to start from the main volume, and on set up to start into the Recovery environment.\n\n*For a Fusion Drive (a small fast SSD combined with a big slow HD via Core Storage), the booter is located on a small Boot OS X volume on the SSD. Boot OS X is similar to a Recovery HD, but doesn't have the Recovery environment files, just the booter and necessary support files for that. There is a Recovery HD in this setup, but it's over on the HD so it doesn't take up precious SSD capacity. (The reason that the booter is split out and put on the SSD is to make the boot process faster.)\n\n\nIt is possible, under at least some circumstances, to start up from a Core Storage volume with just a Boot OS X volume, not the full Recovery HD volume. But I haven't experimented with the limits of this, so I can't say too much about it. What I will say is that starting up from any Core Storage volume is going to require some sort of second non-CS volume to load the booter from.\nAnd of course, in 10.13 the new APFS volume format adds yet another set of complications to this. I haven't experimented with it much yet, so I can't say much about how it works.\n\nA: Without a recovery partition you can't enable FileVault 2:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837\n\n\"Without a Recovery System, FileVault won't encrypt your startup drive.\"\n\nI'll bet CoreStorage volumes will work, just probably not encrypted ones.\n", "Q: Will the absence of connected charger increase the cycle count? I'm a new MacBook user, so I may be relying on rumours instead of fact.\nIt sounds quite silly, but, from my perspective, if I always hold my laptop connected to a charger, then my battery is always around 100% and it seems like the battery cycle count is not growing at that time. And, if I take my laptop somewhere without a charger, then I get this 40-60% decrease, then I think it's at this moment the cycle count increases more than it would if it is connected to a charger.\nI guess I'm a little confused by cycle counts. What are the facts about how they are measured?\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure I understand your question, but one cycle is equivalent to a full discharge then recharge.\nSo, using your example, if you use the MacBook without a charger and its charge decreases by 40% and then you recharge it, that's effectively .4 of a cycle. \nIn other words, to use a simpler scenario, if you use half of your MacBook's charge in one day, and then recharge it fully, and then the next day you do exactly the same, those two days combined would count as one charge cycle.\nSo, some users may go through a cycle a day, others can use their MacBook for weeks before completing a cycle.\nFor more info on this refer to Determining battery cycle count for Mac notebooks.\n", "Q: kernel_task Virtual Memory Size too high I'm using MacBook Pro (\"Core i7\" 2.5 15\" Mid-2015 (DG) 2.5 GHz Core i7 (I7-4870HQ) 16GB RAM) with MacOS Sierra 10.12.4 on it.

Like 200 each day.\nI have to email every single Portrait via Mail. A gallery with all portraits in one is not allowed because of privacy stuff.\nThe client wants definitely emails.\nI tried to program an Applescript/Automator action to do this automatically. \nMy plan is to name all the files like so: name@client.com_2847.jpg and let the action do the rest of the magic.\nIt kind of works, except that i am not able to extract the mail address from the jpg file.\nHow do I extract the Email from the file (for example deleting the last 9 digits) and putting it in as the recipient?\nI saw a similar question here: Automator -> send file to email (from filename)\nbut for some reason I get many syntax errors.\nthanks!\n\nA: Since in your question, you did not include any code, error message(s), or even how you were implementing your solution, I'll offer the following as an example of how I might automate the task at hand. Note that while I looked at the link in your question, nonetheless, since it was for Outlook and you've tagged the question with mail.app, I'm going to ignore what was linked and proceed my way from scratch.\nIn this example scenario, I created a hierarchical folder structure under ~/Photos, e.g. ~/Photos/Clients/Name/Emailed Photos, and this is the folder that I'll drag the target photos to, that have the naming convention e.g. name@client.com_2847.jpg, and the folder to which the Automator Folder Action workflow will be attached to.\nIn Automator:\n\n\n*\n\n*File > New\n\n*Select, Folder Action and click the Choose button.\n\n*In the Folder Action receives files and folders added to Choose Folder list box, select: Other...\n\n*Navigate to the target folder, the one the action is to be applied to, select it and click the Choose button.\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action to the newly created Folder Action workflow.\n\n*Highlight the default AppleScript code, and delete it.\n\n*Copy and paste the AppleScript code, shown below, into the Run AppleScript action.\n\n*Save the Folder Action as, e.g.: Email Photos to name@client\n\n\n*\n\n*This will be saved as, e.g.: \n~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions/Email Photos to name@client.workflow\nNow when you drag photos having the naming convention, e.g. name@client.com_2847.jpg to the target folder, e.g. ~/Photos/Clients/Name/Emailed Photos, one email for each photo will be created and the target file attached. Initially the email will not be automatically sent until you uncomment, remove the -- from in front of the -- send theMessage line of code, and save the changes. This is initially commented out so you can test with one file and get your subject and message setup to meet your needs. I'd use a file that has your email address in it for testing purposes, doing one at first then several at one time.\nThe email message subject and content are initially set to \"Portraits\" and Photo attached.\" respectively, as placeholders. Additionally there is another line of commented code, -- delay 2, above the -- send theMessage line of code that you may need/want to implement if adding a large number of files at the same time to the target folder which has the Folder Action attached, as rapid sending may cause issues. Note that the value of the delay command may need to be adjusted higher as appropriate to accommodate the conditions and you'll just have to do some testing to see what works for you. While I did do some testing, I used a very small file (3 KB) that I replicated and sequentially named for testing purposes. I'll assume your photos will be much larger in size.\nAppleScript code:\n\nproperty theMessageSubject : \"Portraits\"\nproperty theMessageContent : \"Photo attached.\"\n\non GetTheRecipientNameFrom(theFilename)\n    --      # Get the filename portion of the alias passed to the Folder Action.        \n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \":\"\n    set theFilename to last item of text items of theFilename\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\n    --      # Make sure the filename contains both an '_' and \"@\".\n    --      # This doesn't guarantee a properly formed email address,\n    --      # however it does attempt to validate what was passed as one.   \n    if theFilename contains \"_\" and theFilename contains \"@\" then\n        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"_\"\n        set theFilename to first item of text items of theFilename\n        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\n        return theFilename\n    else\n        return \"\"\n    end if\nend GetTheRecipientNameFrom\n\non run {input, parameters}\n    set fileCount to (count of items of input)\n    set i to 1\n    repeat fileCount times\n        set theMessageAttachment to item i of input\n        set theRecipient to GetTheRecipientNameFrom(theMessageAttachment as string)\n        if theRecipient is not equal to \"\" then\n            tell application \"Mail\"\n                activate\n                set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, subject:theMessageSubject, content:theMessageContent & linefeed & linefeed}\n                tell theMessage\n                    make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:theRecipient}\n                end tell\n                tell content of theMessage\n                    make new attachment with properties {file name:theMessageAttachment} at after last paragraph\n                end tell\n                set i to i + 1\n                -- delay 2\n                -- send theMessage\n            end tell\n        else\n            set i to i + 1\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend run\n\n\nNote that as coded, if a file dropped into the target folder, the folder to which the Folder Action is attached, does not conform to the naming convention of e.g. name@client.com_2847.jpg, then no email for that file should be created, unless the portion of the filename preceding the underscore contains the @ symbol and any other characters. In other words, the only error checking the code, as is, attempts to validate is the filename contains a valid email address only on the premise if it has both an underscore and @ symbol, then it assumes the filename conforms to e.g. name@client.com_2847.jpg. More strict error checking could be coded, however I'll leave that to you if what's presented isn't adequate.\nAdditionally, other forms of general error checking could be implemented, i.e. making sure the file was actually attached before sending, etc., however this answer is meant to be a simple example, not necessarily a fully coded solution. The onus is on you to insure you implement appropriate error checking as conditions warrant.\nAs you might be able to tell by the images below, I wrote and tested this in a pre OS X 10.9 environment, OS X 10.8.6 to be specific and I have \"Enable access for assistive devices\" checked in Accessibility preferences. In OS X 10.9 and later, including the latest version of macOS, Sierra, you may need to add Mail and or Automator to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility in order for the Folder Action to work. I'm not in a position to test in those versions at the moment, however if it doesn't work for you, then add these apps accordingly.\n\n\n", "Q: Mac Pro 2008 3,1 memory upgrade As you can discover, there are two riser cards, each with 4 slots accepting ECC FB-DIMM modules with heat-spreaders operating at 800 MHz, and I've just upgraded from 4x1GB, all on riser A to 4x1GB on riser A plus 4x4GB on riser B for a total of 20 GB. My question is whether it is better to mix the 4GB and the 1GB modules (pairwise) on a single riser card or to do it the way I've done it, segregated.\nI've had a look around on this specific question, beginning with Apple's installation manuals online, and have no guidance so far, so I suspect there isn't any reason to do things differently. In fact, the new 16 GB upgrade was not recognized right away and I had to swap the two riser cards, top for bottom, to see all the RAM. I've done one round of testing using Rember (the GUI for memtest) and it has run tests through \"Bit Spread\" without registering any errors in the 17 GB or so that it is testing.\nMy inclination is to leave well enough alone, but I am curious as to whether my installation the best for the long run both with respect to heat dissipation and memory access.\n\nA: The 'pairs' on a 3,1 are rather confusing & don't map how you would expect.\nThe common confusion is to think that 'a pair' is one stick in the same place on each riser - because that's how the machine shipped when new.\nFrom Apple KB - Mac Pro (Mid 2012 and earlier): How to remove or install memory\nIf you have            Install\n\nTwo DIMMs              One on the top memory card and one on the bottom card\nFour DIMMs             One pair on the top memory card and one pair on the bottom card\nSix DIMMs              Two pairs on the top memory card and one pair on the bottom card\nEight DIMMs            Two pairs on the top memory card and two pairs on the bottom card\n\nSo, in essence you currently have 2 pairs of 1GB & 2 pairs of 4GB & you have them mapped to the best configuration for dual-channel memory.\nThere should be no difference if you mix the pairs to have 2x1 & 2x4 on each riser, so long as you keep each as a pair, next to each other, on any riser.\n", "Q: How to use EasyFind (or a similar application) to search inside ~/Library?

I use the iCloud Photos web interface to move photos from my iPhone to my Mac all the time. This is as simple as logging into iCloud on the web, selecting a photo (or multiple photos) and clicking download. Works fine.\nI have never created and synced an album before, but I see all of my pre-existing iPhone albums in the web interface (like the ones that installed apps will make… Instagram, Layout, Skitch, etc). So, I didn't think it would be a problem. \nI created an album of photos on my iPhone. I logged in to iCloud Photos in Safari on my Mac and expected to see that album there. It's not. Fine. Maybe it take a while to sync. I've given it about 6 hours and still nothing.\nWhat's going on here? Is it a timing thing? Can I force the album to sync? \nI should also note that all of the photo from the album, exist in the web interface… it's the album itself that's missing.\n\nA: I forced the album to appear by doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a new photo on the iPhone\n\n*Add newly taken photo to album on iPhone\n\n*Reload the iCloud Photos web interface\n\n\nThe new photo and the album now appear. \nMy theory is that when iCloud recognized the new photo (which happens fairly reliably… for me, anyway) it looked at its other attributes, noticed it's part of an album, noticed that the album doesn't exist on the web yet… and initiated a full sync.\nWhat a total kludge of solution. Seems to work though.\n", "Q: USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 (mini-Display port) to HDMI I have a monitor which I connect to an older Macbook Air using an HDMI to mini DisplayPort connector.\nI also recently got a late 2016 Macbook Pro with 4 USB-C ports.\nSo, my question is: if I plug a USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 connector into the Macbook Pro, and then HDMI to mini DisplayPort connector into the Tunderbolt 2, would it work?\nIn short, would the following chain work: USB-C -> thunderbolt 2 -> mini DisplayPort -> HDMI work?\n\nA: Technically speaking what you are doing is this:\n    Thunderbolt 3 --> Thunderbolt 2 --> Display Port --> HDMI\nUSB-C and mini Display Port are interfaces while Thunderbolt, Display Port and HDMI are interfaces and signaling/protocols.\nIt's important to note this distinction because you cannot go from USB (A, C, or whatever) to Thunderbolt; you go from Thunderbolt to USB (it's not bi-directional).\nSo, assuming that you are going from TB3 to a TB2 to a mDP to HDMI, it should work because: \n\n\n*\n\n*TB3 is backward compatible with TB2 and TB1\n\n*TB includes the DP signaling\n\n*mDP should convert to HDMI.\n\n\nThat said, you may run into issues due to all the conversations.  First off, the mDP to HDMI conversion can cause issues.  It's best to just stick with one protocol like DisplayPort.  Even if you convert from mDP to DP, you are only changing the physical interface, not the protocol or signaling.\nSecondly, converting from TB3 to TB2 so you can use mDP HDMI is just adding another link in the chain which becomes another point of failure/trouble.  It's always best to limit the number of connections/conversions to ensure reliability.\nFinally, you didn't mention which mDP to HDMI adapter you are using, but you want to make sure you are using an active adapter (see link above for more details).  This will help with reliability of the video connection.\nTL;DR\nIt should work, but you may run into performance/stability issues because of all the conversions.  Your best bet is to to either USB-C to HDMI or USB-C to Display Port (preferred because no conversion is required).\n", "Q: compress jpeg images from terminal I am looking for a way to compress jpeg images on a Mac from Terminal. Basically, a library like pngquant, except it is for jpeg format.\nAre you aware of a software that does that?\n\nA: You can use GraphicsMagick which is a newer and more efficient image processing system than ImageMagick. Both apps are available via download, MacPorts, and Homebrew.\nI suggest using GraphicsMagick as it is smaller and faster than ImageMagic. The commands are the same with the only difference being that you prepend a gm with the GraphicsMagick tool.\nThe commands are as follows:\n\n*\n\n*GraphicsMagick:\ngm convert -quality X% source.jpg result.jpg\n\n\n*ImageMagick:\nconvert -quality X% source.jpg result.jpg\nX is a positive integer value (i.e. 85 for 85%); source and result are the original filename and the output filename.\n", "Q: Numbers for OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 I need Numbers for OS X Yosemite.

After the upgrade to version 7.25 (around April 2016) of Skype for MacOS, the ability to change the conversation volume in a way independent from the system volume seems to have been removed. To be clear, I am referring to the ability to change a Skype conversation audio volume, while leaving the System volume unchanged, so that System's sounds and other applications sounds stay the same.\nIn the past versions this was done via two entries in \"Conversations\" menu, or via the two keyboard shortcuts cmd-alt-up_arrow and cmd-alt-down_arrow.\nIs there a way to have that functionality back?\n\nA: The functionality has not been removed, it is only disabled in the default settings.\nIn order to have it back, go to the Preferences, in the Audio/Video panel, and change the \"Speakers\" drop down menu from \"Same as System\" to \"Built-in Output (Internal Speakers)\" (or any other output you have available, I guess). This gives you back the Skype volume adjustment, independent from the System volume.\nOnce you change the preferences, the two extra menu entries will also be back in \"Conversations\" menu.  \nI have checked this on Skype version 7.49 (274) under MacOS 10.11.2 (El Capitan).\n\nA: On Skype v8.41.0.54 for mac, during a call just move your mouse cursor over the mic icon and wait a few seconds : a pop-up menu appears and you will be able to adjust the volume of the conversation without altering the global volume of your mac. \n\n", "Q: Is using mid 2012 MacBook Pro RAM in mid 2011 iMac 27\" an option? I recently came into possession of a 27 inch mid 2011 iMac. It only has 4GB RAM and I have been pricing compatible memory modules online.\nI  then remembered I also have a 13 inch mid 2012 MacBook Pro that was damaged some time ago. It has 8GB RAM that I have no reason to suspect has any faults as it worked fine before the damage which was not anywhere near the bottom case. So I thought I would investigate the types of memory modules the iMac and MacBook Pro use.\n\n\n*\n\n*I found the iMac uses 204 pin PC3-10600 (1333 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM modules.\n\n*I found the MBP uses 204 pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM modules.\nObviously I'm thinking that if I can use the MacBook Pro RAM in the iMac I can save some money and it's a good way of recycling.\nI understand this RAM would not operate at 1600 MHz in the iMac. My questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Would the MBP RAM work okay otherwise?\n\n*If it would work, does it make a difference if I add them to the original RAM so I have 12GB in total, or will I have to remove the old modules and just use the 8GB instead?\n\n\nA: While I am not a fan of of mixing and matching memory, Crucial, a manufacturer of quality memory components, has this on their website:\n\nMemory is designed to be backward-compatible, so generally speaking,\n  you can safely add faster memory to a computer that was designed to\n  run slower memory. However, your system will operate at the speed of\n  the slowest memory module.\n\nSo, technically speaking, the answer to both your questions is, yes it will work and no it won't make a difference as you can mix and match the different speeds.\nThey also go on to say...\n\nKeep in mind, that the right memory for your computer is the kind of\n  memory it was designed to take. Check your system manual or look up\n  your system in the Crucial Memory Advisor or System Scanner tools to\n  find the memory guaranteed to be 100 percent compatible or your money\n  back!\n\nWell, the \"system scanner tool\" is for PC's but the rest of the statement is absolutely true.  The last part about \"money back\" is why I only buy from reputable manufacturers like Crucial (PNY and  Kingston are excellent choices as well).\nThat said, according to Everymac.com, the maximum supported memory configuration is 32GB1.  Personally, I would (at minimum) sell the  existing memory that you have (4GB modules are going for around $20USD on eBay) and instead buy a  16GB kit so you can max out your memory in your iMac either today or at a later date.\nMy personal iMac runs with 32GB of RAM which allows me to virtualize a Windows 10 machine, and two FreeBSD servers (one for development/testing and the other for a Plex media server).  I am a firm believer in the old axiom \"it't better to have and not need than to need and not have.\"\n\n1 Everymac.com:  Officially, this model supports four 4 GB modules -- one in each slot for a maximum of 16 GB of memory. However, third-parties have discovered that it actually will support 32 GB of memory using four 8 GB modules.\n\nA: The MBP RAM should work just fine on the iMac. The instruction on how to install the memory in the iMac is here. To mix them, make sure you put the pair that came with the iMac in a bank, and the one that came with the MBP into the other (don't mix them basically). If you never touched the memory on the iMac before just put the one on the MBP in the empty slot.\nAlso for reference your iMac supports up to 16GB.\n", "Q: macOS: MacBook goes hibernate during night and does not restore all windows after turning on Using MacBook Pro 13 2015 with macOS Sierra.\nJust closing my Mac lid.

VS has always been my favorite IDE, I don't really like Xamarin Studio. \n\nA: According to the System Requirements for Visual Studio for Mac:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*NET Core SDK 1.1 is required to use .NET Core projects and features. It can be downloaded and installed separately, and requires Mac OS X\n  El Capitan 10.11 or higher.\n  \n*Xamarin.Android requires the 64-bit Java Development Kit (JDK).\n  \n*Xamarin.iOS requires Apple's Xcode IDE and iOS SDK.\n  \n*Xamarin.Forms can target both Android and iOS platforms, given the requirements listed above.\n  \n\nIt makes no mention of Xamarin Studio being required.  \n", "Q: How can I delete one of my devices from the \"lists of known hosts (ECDSA)\" after connecting to it with SSH? How can I delete one of my devices from the \"lists of known hosts (ECDSA)\" after connecting to it with SSH on Sierra ?\n\nA: You can delete a device entry by navigating to ~/.ssh/known_hosts and remove the respective line:\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder hit cmdshiftG, enter ~/.ssh/ and hit Go. Open the file known_hosts with a text editor and remove the line with your device's host name or IP-address and the ecdsa key hint (e.g. ecdsa-sha2-nistp25).\n\n\n*Open Terminal and enter nano ~/.ssh/known_hosts. Move the cursor to the respective line and hit ctrlK to remove the line. To save the modified file and exit nano hit ctrlO and ctrlX\n\nThe known_hosts file looks like this:\nip-address (or host name) key_hint key \n\n→  one line per ip-address/host!\nExample:\nhost.example.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDWn...\n192.168.0.7 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDEIb...\n192.168.2.7 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDEIb...\nhost3 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDWn...\ngithub.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAq2A7...\nhost2.example.com ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHA...\n\nOpening the file in an editor like TextEdit the lines are probably wrapped:\n\nTo remove a host (in the example github.com), choose ip (or host name), key hint and key and delete it.\nEditing ~/.ssh/known_hosts removes the host for the actual user only.\n\nA: Or just simply using ssh-keygen -R ip-address-or-hostname-of-your-device.\n", "Q: Time Machine always makes a full backup I have a new iMac running OSX 10.12.4. It has an internal Apple-Supplied 512Gb SSD, of which about 140 Gb is used. As with my previous machine, I use Time Machine to backup on to an external 2Tb hard disk.\nHowever, I find that every TM backup appears to be a full backup, not an incremental backup.\nHow can I get Time Machine to make proper incremental backups, as it’s supposed to?\nBy way of background,\n\n\n*\n\n*Each backup takes a very long time; so long that it cannot backup hourly because it’s still completing the last backup.\n\n*On the Preferences panel it tells me that it is backing up … GB of 131 GB.\n\n*The space left on the drive corresponds to multiplying the number of backups by the full amount of data.\n\n*After about 18 backups, it starts deleting old backups\n\n*I get the disk full message too soon\n\n\nSo I am convinced that they’re all full backups.\nI have tried everything I can think of, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*turning it off and on again\n\n*re-formatting the drive\n\n*replacing the drive\n\n*reinstalling the OS\n\n*deleting the plist, as per Pondini’s web site\n\n*removing some software suspected of interfering with TM\n\n*excluding additional folders\n\n*putting chicken feathers in a paper bag and waving it around my head\n\n\nI have spent countless hour with Apple support. As a desperation move, they now want me to do a clean install, which, in my opinion is going too far, and certainly not something I am enthusiastic.\nI am aware of this question: Time Machine keeps doing full backups\nbut\n\n\n*\n\n*it’s 5 years old\n\n*the asker says that TM also does incremental backups\n\n*despite the accepted answer, the question is not really answered\n\n\nA: Backups are managed via Apple File System Events (not Spotlight)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSEvents\nIt seems most likely that something is touching your files in a way that convinces TimeMachine a new copy is needed. There could also be something damaging the FSEvent cache which would cause TM to create a new backup.\nYou might want to check the system console log and see if there are any messages there that hint at the underlying problem.\n\nA: My gut reaction is that this sounds like Spotlight isn't indexing properly.  Spotlight is how the system knows which files have been backed up and which files have since changed or been added.  My first step might be to reset Spotlight by opening Terminal and running this command:\n$ sudo mdutil -E /\n\nthat'll delete /.Spotlight-V100 and rebuild it on your main volume.\nFailing that, head on over to http://pondini.org/TM/D7.html - that website is fantastic for troubleshooting Time Machine issues, and that page is dedicated specifically to the problem you're experiencing.\n\nA: This doesn’t resolve why the problem arose in the first place, but it certainly fixed the problem.\nAfter spending many hours with Apple support, somebody finally suggested that I reinstall the whole thing and start again. Needless to say, I was reluctant to try that.\nHowever, an Apple Genius whom I consulted on a different matter did mention that doing this and restoring from a Time Machine backup to a fresh setup actually does things differently.\nI had enough space on my internal disk to partition it so I could try it out without losing everything.\nHere are the steps I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition the internal drive using Disk Utility\n\n*Reboot into Recovery Mode\n\n*Install MacOS into the new partition\n\n*Reboot into the new partion and follow the usual process\n\n*When the time comes choose to restore from a Time Machine backup\n\n\nThere were a few minor issues with reconfiguring some things which TM didn’t have, but over all it worked smoothly. It is a pleasure to see it all working properly again.\nPhew.\n", "Q: How to open PDF files stored in iBooks on iPad in Adobe Reader I have downloaded PDF files and saved them in iBooks on my iPad. I want to open some PDF files in Adobe Reader but there is no option to do so. \nI looked up on internet and it asks for a PC (which I don't have). Is there any way to do so?\nI am using iPad Air 2.\n\nA: Unfortunately iBooks on iOS doesn't have the ability to show a share sheet for a document, and therefore can't share to Adobe Reader directly. A workaround is to tap Share → Email, email the PDF to yourself, then use Mail to open the attachment with Adobe Reader.\n", "Q: Will an internal optical drive from a non-Apple manufacturer be fully functional in a MBP 13\" Mid 2009? I have had a faulty internal superdrive (Apple calls their optical drives superdrives) for the longest time in my MBP 13\" Mid 2009. I want to replace it, but in my area it's pretty hard to come across a superdrive, be it new or used. I considered an external optical drive but quickly dismissed it, as it would be a pain to carry around and from what I've heard MPB's don't allow using external optical drives for recovering from CDs.\nThe next step was to check for any obvious signs of incompatibility. I looked at my MBP's optical drive, and sure enough, on first glance it looked like a standard laptop optical drive. The MBP Mid 2009 is decently upgradeable, with us being able to replace the shipped battery and the HDD. Unless there are some special requirements I am unaware of, I feel this is possible.\nAnother query I have is: Even if the optical drive works for general CD reading, will it work for recovery? Or will it act like the aforementioned external optical drives?\nPlease note: I have already put an optical drive caddy for an SSD earlier, and I didn't quite like it because it added extra bulk to the Mac. In the end I took the SSD out of the drive caddy and replaced the old HDD with the SSD. I removed the caddy too. It made the Mac much lighter. And yes, I have put in the faulty optical drive to check the weight and I find it quite a bit lighter.\n\nA: A SATA drive is a SATA drive.  The fact that you were able to put in a SATA optical bay caddy for an SSD is evidence that an aftermarket SATA drive works.\nLooking at the SATA connector of the \"SuperDrive\" you will notice that it's the exact same SATA data and power connector of pretty much any other SATA drive\n\nSo, the trick here is finding a SATA optical drive that has the SATA connector in the same location.\nThere is no reason for a different CD/DVD drive won't work for recovery.  As long as it can read/write, you can use it.  You can boot from CD/DVD by holding down C while booting.  After all, the MacBook Air requires you to use an external (USB) drive if you want to do recovery.\nSpeaking of recovery, if weight is an issue, why not get a USB flash drive.  You can get a 128GB USB Flash for around $30 and is great for backup/recovery. \nPersonally speaking I haven't used a genuine Apple Super Drive in years - I either use  external hard drives or USB flash drives.  On the rare occasion I need a CD/DVD drive, I have a Plextor USB CD/DVD RW drive which works perfectly.\n", "Q: Where is subpixel rendering handled? I recently learned about subpixel rendering, and was fascinated by how it works. On my mac, I can turn it on and off in system prefs - general - LCD font smoothing, which implies to me that it is handled by the OS, not by individual applications. My first question is, is this assumption correct? How is subpixel rendering handled? On my friend's computer with a retina display, the LCD font smoothing did not seem to add colors to text like on mine. Do retina displays handle it differently?\nSince I was curious about the process, I tried turning it off and back on again. I noticed that some applications took a while to accept the changes, but restarting usually applied them. However! I've turned LCD font smoothing back on, and it works everywhere except this website. This is true in Chrome and Safari. What's the deal with that? Did I mess something up, or does the website somehow prevent subpixel rendering? How and why?\n\nA: For those of you who are still curious, I ran across this site, explaining how to turn subpixel rendering on and off for a webpage. Make sure to check out the demo page. I still don't know how it's handled at the OS level, but I'm guessing that to get any farther I'd have to actually learn about how fonts are rendered, and I don't think I'm prepared to do that. It also looks like there is a debate in the community over whether subpixel antialiasing is better than pixel antialiasing. Here is the case for subpixel rendering.\n", "Q: Installing OpenMP-enabled XGBoost I have scoured the web trying to figure out how to install XGboost.

I have established that I need to carry out the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode and disable SIP since I'm running El Capitan\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Mount the MacProEFIUpdate dmg (for 5.1)\n\n*Run MacEFIRom's utility.\n\n*Shutdown and power back up by holding the power button until light flashes and beep sounds\n\n*Verify Boot ROM Version: MP51.007F.B03\n\n*Boot into recovery mode and enable SIP\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Reset PRAM\n\n\nThe problem comes at step 4. As far as I can see, the act of disabling SIP, also disables my internet connection. This causes a road block because the MacEFIRom utility will only run if the internet is active. So I cannot run step 4 and beyond. I might investigate the possibility of running and Ethernet Cable to the front room where my WiFi Router is, thus bypassing the wireless aspect of the connection. Other than that I'm out of ideas. \nCan any anyone tell me how I can achieve all 9 items on the list? Or indeed, if my list of steps is incorrect please can you correct me?\n\nA: I ran an ethernet cable and was able to progress through the list of tasks. It took two attempts to pass step 5.

But nothing seems to work.\nShe has also sent a request to me. But nothing seems to get through.\nI have read that game center does not allow adding friends in iOS 10. Does that mean it also doesn't work I iOS 9 now? \nNote: my daughter is under 13 and we have entered her age as such. That does kind of limitations in some games. But I had not heard that it would block her from using Game Center friends.\n\nA: Many Game Center's features were removed from the Game Center service itself so they still wouldn't work, including adding friends, even if you have Ios 9 (and in Ios 10 obviously).\nNow, you  can see just the rankings and the goals of the game; you can also invite and challenge your friends only through iMessage, and only if the game supports it.\n", "Q: Garageband—how to change volume of a region (not whole track)? In garageband I have one audio track with many regions. I'd like to adjust the volume for each region. Is there an easy way to do that, or do I have to make a new track each time, and adjust the tracks volume?\n\nA: Finally found the answer, not very intuitive but cool once you know.\nThere's a button to toggle 'automation'. Once that's on you can select from a dropdown whether you want to change volume, echo, reverb, etc. Then you click on the actual waves on the track and a coloured line will appear. Clicking along the line creates break points, and you can move either points or the line segments between points to shift the volume. It's not based on regions—you can adjust it anywhere.\nFor more information:\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/238649/how-to-use-automation-in-garageband/\n\nA: Under “Mix,” choose Show Automation. You didn’t have to do this before. Now you do.\n", "Q: Customise Touch Bar for a specific application So I've been using the MacBook Pro with Touch bar for a week and the Touch Bar seems pretty convenient. However, I haven't found an option to customize the Touch Bar for a specific app.\nFor example, whenever I code via jetBrains phpStorm, I'm used to having the F[0-12] Buttons (which aren't displayed in the keyboard anymore in favor of the Touch Bar). I know that if I'm holding the fn button, I'll be able to see the F[0-12] Buttons. But I want them to be displayed by default without the need to hold the fn button.\nIs there a way I can achieve this?\n\nA: Assuming I understand your question, you can set your Touch Bar to show the function keys as its default display on an app by app basis.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Select the Keyboard preference pane\n\n*Click on the Shortcuts tab\n\n*In the left sidebar, select the Function Keys option\n\n*On the right-hand side click on the plus + button\n\n*Select the JetBrains PhpStorm app\n\n*Add the app\n\n\nNow, whenever you are using the JetBrains PhpStorm app, the Touch Bar should display all the function keys.\n\nA: In addition to Monomeeths answer there's another kind of Touch Bar configuration that is worth mentioning:\nSystem-native way of configuring elements displayed in Touch Bar for specific application is (or at least should be) provided by application itself.\nUsually, but not necessarily, this configuration is in View menu. A rule of thumb is to look for Customise Touch Bar... element in one of status bar menus before you start digging deeper in application preferences. \nThis screenshot is made for Safari browser, however it works the same way for many other applications:\n\nSometimes applications bury Touch Bar configuration a bit deeper inside their own preferences. For example here's where any JetBrains IDE will have it:\n \n\nA: If you want to REALLY customize your Touch Bar, you'll need BetterTouchTool.\nThere is a short post on the official BTT site, linking to a long blog post on medium.com illustrating Touch Bar customization using BTT.\n\nIn the interest of link rot prevention, here are a couple of Touch Bar screenshots from the blog post.\nHolding down Ctrl key for a custom window management bar:\n\nCustomized for the PyCharm IDE:\n\nThere is a lot more, and the above arrangements were customized by the USER, not the Pycharm developers or even the BTT developer.\n\nNote: I am not affiliated with BetterTouchTool in any way, I just use it and think it's the best quality product of its type—and more people should use it!  :)\n\nA: Just to add to @Monomeeth answer if you're using the Jetbrains Toolbox the app will be buried in the Library and you'll have to update the location on each PhpStorm update. If you add the symlink created by the Toolbox it will not work. You need to add the actual .app from the location in the Library and it's kind of very deep in there...\nThe current location in MacOS is ~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/PhpStorm/ch-0/202.7660.42/PhpStorm.app but this will change on each update.\nThere's a related issue to this regarding adding the apps in the dock. See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TBX-669\nTook me while to find the dam location so hope this helps.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra Spotlight search does not find Numbers but Number My Spotlight search behaves strange and I don't know how to fix it. \nAny Ideas?\nWhen I want to open Numbers, I hit command space  and start typing \"number\",\n\nbut if I keep on typing the \"s\", essentially completing the app name Numbers, Spotlight does not know what to do anymore.\n\nDoes the index point into a wrong direction? If I search for a specific file it works.\nI tried the solutions by Anil and Senseful here, but the problem does not change\nUPDATE\nAfter rebuilding the Spotlight library the problem shortly disappeared (one week). But it returned again. So maybe my question is not how to solve this problem but what is corrupting my Spotlight index?\nInterestingly the Spotlight results look a bit different now and shows the App-Store Numbers version (which then automatically opens the local one).\n\n\nA: I would start by rebuilding the Spotlight index.\nFrom: How to rebuild the Spotlight index on your Mac\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Choose Apple menu () > System Preferences, then click Spotlight.\n  \n*Click the Privacy tab.\n  \n*Drag the folder or disk that you want to index again to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Or click the\n  Add (+) button and select the folder or disk to add.\n  To add an item to the Privacy tab, you must have ownership permissions for that item. To learn about permissions, choose Help\n  from the Finder menu bar, then search for “permissions.”\n  \n*From the same list of locations, select the folder or disk that you just added. Then click the Remove (–) button to remove it from the\n  list.\n  \n*Quit System Preferences. Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk.\n  \n\nOr via Terminal:\nsudo mdutil -i off /\nsudo mdutil -i on /\nsudo mdutil -E\n\nSee the man page for mdutil or type man mdutil in Terminal.\n\nA: I would first do as suggested in Hefewe1zen's answer, rebuild the Spotlight index on your Mac.\nIf that doesn't fix the issue, then the next thing I'd try is rebuilding the Launch Services Database.\nIn Terminal:\n/S*/L*/F*/C*/F*/L*/S*/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nI always use the short form of the command above, however here is the long form:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nThere is no manual page for lsregister however, the following command outputs the internal help file:\n/S*/L*/F*/C*/F*/L*/S*/lsregister --help\n\nIf you want to read more about rebuilding the Launch Services Database, Google is your friend!\nIf by chance neither of these suggested answers work, then I'd reinstall Numbers.\n", "Q: MacOS Server: Volume … not responding I have recently installed MacOS Server on my iMac running Sierra 10.12.4.

I don’t think I have so many volumes attached, so I can’t work out what’s going on.\n\n\n*\n\n*how can I discover more about a particular volume from the id?\n\n*why would it keep changing?\n\n\nA: The Mac OS X Server disk watcher is pretty sensitive, and it seems to get triggered by apfs volume snapshot notifications (they will have \"@-snap\" in their names). It may also trigger on mobile time machine volume unmounts which as I recall looks like a uuid. If it is not a volume name that you recognize, I would not worry.\n", "Q: Does macOS's Core Graphic Rendering convert everything into PDF? That is, when you run games like Quake (which are, I believe in OpenGL), is every frame internally converted to PDF and then rasterized?\nOr, when I do a game in UIKit/GameKit, it is also internally converted to PDF, frame-by-frame?\nAt least, I lost as I understood from the source: ARS Technica -Inside Quartz \n\nA: I think it's essential to know where the PDF model for rendering comes into play in the macOS graphics and windowing system.\nFrom the ARS Technica article:\n\nit is important to understand that Core Graphics Services deals with\n  more or less \"ready-to-display\" data sent to it from higher layers in\n  the graphics system. It is a pixel pusher, not a graphics creator\n\n\nSo, everything is built on top of Core Graphics Services.  The PDF engine is used to render essentially what you are seeing on your desktop (for a lack of a better word).  For instance, the rendering of an App like TextEdit, Numbers or Microsoft Word would go through Core Graphics Rendering (the PDF model).\n\nCore Graphics Rendering uses PDF for its internal vector graphics\n  representation. Apple describes its rationale for using PDF as\n  follows:\n\nAs a superset of Adobe PostScript, PDF brings several improvements,\n    including better color management, internal compression, font\n    independence, and interactivity. However, PDF is not a full-fledged\n    language as is PostScript; it is declaratively, not programmatically,\n    specified. Consequently a sophisticated and expensive language runtime\n    is not necessary, as it is for PostScript.\n\n\nBasically, what this is saying is that Core Graphics Rendering (just one of the graphics rendering systems) uses PDF because of its features over PostScript. \nAs for streaming media and \"high performance graphics applications\" like games it will go through a different rendering engine.  OpenGL is a vectoring engine and it interacts directly with a systems GPU.  It would be wildly inefficient to convert to a PDF model then display the rendered results.\nSo, to answer your question (and TL;DR):\n\nThat is, when you run games like Quake (which are, I believe in\n  opengl), is every frame internally converted to PDF and then\n  rasterized?\n\nNo, games that use OpenGL are rendered in OpenGL and passed off to Core Graphics Services which just \"pushes the rendered pixels.\"\n", "Q: Limit automatic updates to software and applications only, but not OSX I manage several Macs, and from a security point of view i would like to make sure they where always up to date with the latest patches for their version of OSX.\nI understand there is an inbuilt tool in the \"mac app store\" application to do this. \nMy concern is that the auto update tool would auto update these machines to the latest version of OSX. eg. Sierra. Because we have to run some mission critical software on a few machines we can not upgrade past Yosemite at the moment so i wouldn't want the auto update to upgrade OSX. Is it possible to get the auto update to upgrade applications and patches, but not OSX itself ? \n\nA: It will not automatically update to Sierra.  It will alert you, and will download in the background (one of the \"features\" they copied from Windows 10) but you have to click on the \"Install\" button to install it.  \nI am running El Capitan with everything set to Auto Update and not once has it tried to install Sierra.  However, the way I got around it was that I downloaded it to make a USB Installer and left it in place.\nThat said, you can turn off the background downloading of automatic updates.  In System Preferences --> App Store:\n\nYou also have the option to install app updates and OS X updates, but it will download items in the background.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro flashing folder, start up hard drive not showing in Disk Utility Out of the blue today my MacBook Pro starting showing a flashing folder with a question mark during the boot process.\nI went into Disk Utility to try and restore or reformat the MacBook, but the hard drive does not even show up and everything else is grayed out.\nHere’s a screenshot that shows what I’m talking about. Thanks.\n\n\nA: What a coincidence, I just had this issue with my SSD (a month or two ago). I hope you have a backup (unlike stupid me) otherwise it will be an extreme P.I.T.A. This comes from experience involving talking to lots of Apple cutomer support representatives and many community members.\nDisclaimer\nI never was, and am not an Apple technician. Contact Apple support, and you might receive better instructions. My method involves lots of praying and does not contain any super-secret terminal codes. Sounds good? Let's jump right in!\n!Caution!\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug you battery from your Mac while poking around its internals. Believe you me, I speak from experience.\n\n*Wall of text inbound.\n\n\nStep 1: What is the Mac telling us?\nLet's start off with the meaning of this sign. The folder with a question mark tells us that your Mac cannot find a startup folder. This can happen because of a few reasons. The next step will be pinpointing the issue.\nStep 2: Determining the cause\nWe need to find what the issue is first to troubleshoot it. There's always the off chance that some SATA cable came loose, and you simply need to plug it back in. So make sure all the wires are plugged in firmly. There's also a chance the wire itself is damaged, so if you have a HDD enclosure try plugging the HDD into that and see if it gets recognized in disk utility. If you don't, you might want to purchase one or even buy a replacement SATA cable for your Mac. Another thing that may sound stupid but worth trying is - making sure your HDD is screwed in properly.\nIf you did all of that and your HDD still refuses to be recognized, we know that the problem is in the HDD itself. Here I can only think of 2 possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*A damaged indexing component. In my case my volume header wasn't functioning normally. I fixed it via recovery.\n\n*A dead Hard Drive. I won't lie to you, this unfortunately seems to be your case. But never lose hope!\n\n\nA word before we get our hands dirty: If you can boot into recovery (command + R) on your damaged disk, not over the internet or from another disk, there is almost no possibility of your disk being dead. Same goes for booting into safe mode (press shift on startup). So try these out first!\nStep 3: Troubleshooting\nYou seem knowledgeable about basic recovery techniques such as: Changing the boot disk via the option key, booting into native recovery, booting from a recovery disk, booting into safe mode, etc. That's why I will not explain too much about the how to do things. Let me know if you need more detail.\nBy now I would assume that you have an HDD enclosure or some equivalent accessible to you. Here I can only tell you one thing: make sure you use one that is supposed to work with all HDDs, otherwise the voltage might be too low and that prevents the HDD from firing up. If you feel vibrations, that's a good sign. Now this may seem fruitless to keep checking if everything external is alright, but hear me out. In my case I first plugged my SSD in via the internal SATA cable. Did not work. I tried with an HDD enclosure lying around. Nada. I bought a new enclosure, to no avail. What was happening? The SATA cable was broken, the HDD enclosure lying around had too less voltage and the new enclosure was faulty. Anything is possible! By now the drive should have popped up in disk utility. If it has, use the verify option followed by the repair option. It usually works. If it doesn't tell me and I'll guide you through other troubleshooting techniques.\nYour disk still isn't being recognized? Chances are, your HDD has failed due to defects or age. It may seem cruel to have gone through a huge answer and then end up with this conclusion, but nothing can be done here. Your best chance is to unplug your HDD ASAP, not use it and take it to a technician. If you're feeling brave and there is not much valuable data, you may try DIY data recovery (find steps for this online). If there is valuable data, screw the technician and search for a data recovery center with a good recovery rate and rush right to it. If this happens you should also check out @Allan's answer to that other question.\nOther software like DiskWarrior also exist, which are more specialized than disk utility for recovery purposes. However, they still require the disk to be recognized. It basically means that if disk utility detects the disk but fails to fix it with the repair option, you can try out DiskWarrior.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Do I need to upgrade the firmware on a Mac Pro with mismatched processor config and serial number?

I’m trying to move them to a Mac and delete them from iCloud in order to clear up space.\nI tried to connect my Mac to iCloud Photo Library by going into the Photos app’s preferences; however it then asks me to upgrade to a paid iCloud storage tier because I have over 5GB worth of local images that Photos wants to sync to iCloud.\nSo I don't think using the Photos app is going to work for offloading pictures to a Mac.\nI then logged in to the Photos app at iCloud.com. I was able to select and download individual images, but it won’t let me select more than one at a time, so I can’t download them all in bulk. Selecting the first image, holding down the ⇧ shift key, then selecting the last image causes only the last image to be selected.\nI could click on all 800 images while holding the ⌘ cmd key, but that’s obviously very tedious.\nWhat’s the most efficient way to download images from iCloud Photo Library to a Mac that can’t connect to iCloud Photo Library without upgrading to a paid plan?\n\nA: I highly recommend ndbroadbent's fantastic Python program the icloud_photos_downloader project. The project repository can be found at his Github account: https://github.com/ndbroadbent/icloud_photos_downloader. \nThere are some great instructions on installation and use in the project README. Once installed, you run the program to download all your photos to a directory called foto_folder; from the terminal \n./download_photos.py ../foto_folder \n    --username=myemail@email.com\n    --password=myp@ss\n    --size=original\n    --download-videos\nAnd viola, it does its magic.\nI've also posted this answer here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/311787/271502\n\nA: Go to https://privacy.apple.com/account , sign-in and request download for photos. \n\nYou can request a copy of the data that Apple stores which is\n  associated with your Apple ID. This information includes, but is not\n  limited to:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Your Apple ID account details and sign-in records.\n  \n*Data that you store with iCloud such as contacts, calendars, notes,\n  bookmarks, reminders, email, photos, videos, and document.\n\nfrom https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT208502\n\nA: Now, you can just hit Control-A on the iCloud Photos page, and it will select all the images and videos. Then just click Download on the top right. \n\nA: I was able to figure out a workaround for this. It will force the underlying structure to select all of the photos on the page and allow you to click the download selected photos button. It will download them all separately as if you had selected all of the photos by hand (but without RSI).\nYou need to use Chrome dev tools. I am sure you can do it with other browsers, I just haven't tried.

Then it'll display and download the next photos from the album every second. It's quicker than going through everything manually.\nThis solution will loop at the end of the album, so you need to stop the script when you see all your photos in your download folder. To stop the script, you just need to close the Chrome tab.\n", "Q: Can a shortcut be created to toggle menubar visibility (that would persist, as the dock's does)? I can choose in Syst Prefs to have the menubar show always or hide with auto-show (auto-show being show on hover or show on focus-by-keyboard-shortcut). \nBut when I'm working, I want the menubar always visible. And when I'm recreating, I want it usually hidden. \nI like that with the dock I can hit commandoptiond to show or hide the dock, and it stays shown or hidden until I press the same shortcut again. \nI wish the menubar worked this way too. Can such a shortcut be created somehow? \n\nA: You asked, \"Can a shortcut be created to toggle menubar visibility (that would persist, as the dock's does)?\" and the short answer is, yes.\nHowever, the longer answer is, while it's technically and natively possible to create an Automator Service workflow that gets assigned a keyboard shortcut to hide/unhide the Menu bar in OS X 10.11 and later, including the current macOS, it's not without its issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*You'd have to assign the Automator Service a keyboard shortcut that does not interfere with an existing shortcut in every app that might have focus when you triggered the service's keyboard shortcut.\n\n*Every app that has focus when the service's keyboard shortcut is triggered would have to be added to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility, in order for the service's keyboard shortcut to work.\n\n\nA possible workaround to the second point above would be if there's a third-party app that can be globally set to trigger the Automator Service work flow (or the AppleScript code as an AppleScript script or app not using an Automator Service). This might include apps like Alfred, FastScripts, Karabiner, Karabiner-Elements, Keyboard Maestro, etc., and having not tested these third party apps under this particular scenario I can only offer that as something to look into.\nSo, how about an AppleScript app you could place in the Dock, so it's readily available to click on, that will toggle the state of the Menu bar? You'd only have to add that AppleScript app to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility, in order for it to work.\nIn lieu of a third-party app or as an Automator Service and just as a plain AppleScript app, you do have a keyboard shortcut built in by way of Spotlight, in that you press ⌘space and the first character or two of the name you gave to the AppleScript app and then press enter. As an example, name it tmb.app for toggle menu bar, the you'd press ⌘spacetmenter to trigger the AppleScript App. After all, I double you already have an app named tm installed. \nHowever, that said, it too is not without possible issues in that it relies on UI Scripting, meaning, it has to open System Preferences to the General settings and click the \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar\" checkbox and close System Preferences. This means once you triggered the app, you have to let it run and not manually steal focus from System Preferences while the UI Scripting events take place. In other words, you have to stop multitasking for a couple of seconds.\nIn part, one of the issues using AppleScript and or UI Scripting to hide/unhide the Menu bar is it's just not as graceful as hiding the Dock with its built-in keyboard shortcut, but it's at least doable. \nThat all said, here's the AppleScript code, that can be used in either an AppleScript script/app, Automator Service, or possibly a third party app, that will toggle the state of the Menu bar in OS X 10.11 and later via UI Scripting.\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.general\"\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        click checkbox \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar\" of window \"General\" of process \"System Preferences\"\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\n\nNote there is no error checking to ensure this code in run under OS X 10.11 and later so don't try using it in versions of OS X prior to 10.11. Also note that the value of the delay command may need to be adjusted as necessary under the working conditions of your system.\n\nA: *\n\n*Made an app with Automator using this AppleScript code by \"@user3439894\".\nYou can try setting the delay to 0.1 which worked for me.\n\n\n\n    tell application \"System Preferences\"\n        reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.general\"\n        delay 1\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            click checkbox \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar\" of window \"General\" of process \"System Preferences\"\n        end tell\n        quit\n    end tell\n\n\n\n*Made a keyboard shortcut for the app and mapped it to cmd-ctrl-9\nWorks great.\n\n\nInstructions here:\nhttps://appleinsider.com/articles/18/03/14/how-to-create-keyboard-shortcuts-to-launch-apps-in-macos-using-automator\n\nA: Making some minor adjustments to the original code from user3439894’s answer.  Running this revised code will not bring system preferences app to the front.  \ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.general\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\" to tell window \"General\"\n    click checkbox \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar\" \nend tell\ndelay 1\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\nIn some comments to my answer, it has been pointed out where I have the delay command in my script, makes the script fail.  On my system this script works.\n\nHowever this script on my system will not work if I put the delay command before the system event.\n\n\nA: I'm posting this as a second answer instead of editing my original answer as this new version of the example AppleScript code accommodates issues raised with the use of the delay command and where it was placed in the code presented by wch1zpink and myself between our versions of the code.\nThe new code wraps a much smaller value for the delay command in a repeat loop, thus making the over all code run faster while accommodating the timing differential based on the system specifications of the computer it's been run on. Additionally, because of the use of UI Scripting, the two repeat loops ensures that the UI Elements are available and or have been changed respectively before proceeding within the code.\nThis code was tested under macOS High Sierra and worked as an AppleScript application, Automator service, as described in my original answer, and as an AppleScript .scpt file triggered by FastScripts with an assigned keyboard shortcut, as with the Automator service.\nExample AppleScript code:\nif running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n    try\n        tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n    on error\n        do shell script \"killall 'System Preferences'\"\n    end try\nend if\n\nrepeat while running of application \"System Preferences\" is true\n    delay 0.01\nend repeat\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to ¬\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.general\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    repeat until exists checkbox ¬\n        \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar\" of ¬\n        window \"General\" of process \"System Preferences\"\n        delay 0.01\n    end repeat\n\n    set cbVal to value of checkbox ¬\n        \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar\" of ¬\n        window \"General\" of process \"System Preferences\"\n\n    click checkbox \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar\" of ¬\n        window \"General\" of process \"System Preferences\"\n\n    repeat until cbVal is not (value of checkbox ¬\n        \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar\" of ¬\n        window \"General\" of process \"System Preferences\")\n        delay 0.01\n    end repeat\n\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n\n    Scroll as necessary to view full code.\n \n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and, other then included error handling, does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the used to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors.\nAlso note that I am not affiliated with Red Sweater Software, the developer of FastScripts, just a satisfied user of their product.\n\nA: There are 2 Apple Scripts\nTo show the menu bar:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell dock preferences\n       set autohide menu bar to false\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nTo hide the menu bar:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell dock preferences\n       set autohide menu bar to true\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nSave them as quick actions in Automator and assign the hot keys. Here is the guide how to do it.\n\n*\n\n*Open the Automator app on your Mac.\n\n*Click \"New Document\" and select \"Quick Action\" from the list of templates.\n\n*In the \"Workflow receives current\" dropdown, select \"no input\" and \"any application\".\n\n*In the search bar, type \"Run AppleScript\" and drag the \"Run AppleScript\" action to the right side of the window.\n\n*Paste your AppleScript code into the \"Run AppleScript\" action.\n\n*Save the workflow with a name that describes what it does.\n\n*Open \"System Preferences\" and click \"Keyboard\".\n\n*Click \"Shortcuts\" and then \"Services\" in the left sidebar.\n\n*Scroll down to the \"General\" section and find your saved Automator workflow.\n\n*Click the \"Add Shortcut\" button next to your workflow and press the keys that you want to use as the hotkey.\n\n*Once you have assigned a hotkey to your Automator workflow, you can use that hotkey to run your custom AppleScript application from anywhere on your Mac.\n\nThe specific steps and options may vary depending on the version of macOS you are running.\nThere is no other way to access the dock preferences settings without using the System Events application. This is because the dock preferences settings are a part of the system settings, and can only be accessed through the System Events application.\nHere are some additional scripts:\nThe script to hide the dock together with the menu bar:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  tell dock preferences\n    set autohide menu bar to true\n    set dockAutohide to get autohide\n    set autohide to true\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nThe script to show the dock together with the menu bar:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  tell dock preferences\n    set autohide menu bar to false\n    set dockAutohide to get autohide\n    set autohide to false\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nI combined the scripts, so this script will change the state of the menu bar - if it is hidden, then shown, or otherwise. It can be used with a single hot key.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell dock preferences\n        set currentStatus to autohide menu bar\n        set autohide menu bar to not currentStatus\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nAnd the following script will show or hide both menu bar and the dock - it can be used with a single hot key.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n tell dock preferences\n    set currentStatus to get autohide menu bar\n    if currentStatus then\n        set autohide menu bar to false\n        set dockAutohide to get autohide\n        set autohide to false\n    else\n        set autohide menu bar to true\n        set dockAutohide to get autohide\n        set autohide to true\n    end if\n  end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: I have made some changes to the previous scripts so that it works in 2022 as the location of the checkbox appears to have changed with the MacOS update. For anyone who wants to put the script to use, you can do so via the shortcut app by clicking the '+' icon and typing in \"run AppleScript\". This way, you can have the shortcut appear in the menu bar. You can also create a service with the Automator.app and define a keyboard shortcut for the service in system preferences.\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.dock\"\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        click checkbox \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar in full screen\" of window \"Dock & Menu Bar\" of process \"System Preferences\"\n    end tell\n    delay 1\n    quit\nend tell\n\n", "Q: External hard drive not recognised by MacBook Pro. Recently my segate 1tb external hard drive has been playing up on my late 2013 MacBook Pro with retina. It has been very inconsistent. sometimes it works fine for a day or two or only 2 minutes, and then other times it doesn't even show up. I have looked in disk utility and I cannot find it there. I tried to run 'first aid' on it in disk utility yesterday but got a message saying something along the lines of \"cannot perform first aid because the drive cannot be un-mounted. Thanks in advance for your help! \n\nA: First off if you notice issues with an external drive like you describe that is the drive trying to tell you that it is failing. Hope you have a backup.\nIf it is not showing up in Disk Utility you could try rebooting the Mac, with the drive attached, a time or two. Power cycling the drive, unplugging it and plugging it back in, all of which might get it working or might do nothing at all.\nIf you can get it to mount and there is nothing you need on the drive try re-formatting it. If that fails then you definately have a bad drive instead of just a corrupted one.\nIf you have a third party disk repair utility (I like DiskWarrior) and it will see the drive run that.\nHonestly it sounds like the drive is dying and needs to be replaced, either under warranty or by buying a new one.\n\nA: There is an app named 'Mountain' that will let you mount or unmount your drive. Even if its malfunctioning.  you may try mounting it with this app.\n", "Q: Why can't I airdrop my notes from my mac to my iDevice?

More specifically, trying to share a note does not give me the option of using Airdrop and if I click on the More... option I also see AirDrop listed with a ticked checkmark (greyed out just like in your screenshot).\nThis is not something I had noticed previously as I haven't tried to share a Note from any of my Macs.\nNow, I also checked whether this is a known issue and found this discussion on Apple's website. Although it was started in January 2015, you'll see that the most recent post was (at the time of writing this) just over a week ago.\nI'm not entirely sure why sharing notes via AirDrop from a Mac isn't an option (although the fact that notes are all stored within the Notes app and can be synced via iCloud may be part of the reason).\nI suggest you send feedback to Apple.\nIf you do need a way to share your notes via Airdrop, then there's a few workarounds online (including within the above-mentioned discussion). The one I like most is to do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within the Notes app, open the note you want to share\n\n*Go to File > Export as PDF...\n\n*Click Save\n\n*Within Finder, navigate to the exported PDF\n\n*Right-click on the file \n\n*Select Share > AirDrop\n\n\nA: In the notes app on your MacBook go to File > Share > Airdrop\nI had the same issue as you, but found this way is simpler than the previous answer.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem when changing macbook.

I know how to do it in Linux and \nWindows, but couldn't find any guide for Mac. Any ideas?\n\nA: Though I have not actually done this it should be possible to redirect your desktop folder to a different location. Since the Dropbox folder is just a folder in your user profile (that the Dropbox app then knows what to do with).\nI would avoid using the dropbox folder itself as the desktop folder just to avoid any difficulties or conflicts between macOS and the Dropbox app. Rather I would put a folder called \"Desktop\" in the Dropbox folder and create a symlink in place of your ~/[username]/Desktop folder that points to ~/[username]/Dropbox/Desktop.\nIf you are not familiar with symlinks (the Unix version of an Alias but works with system processes) this link from GigaOm should be helpful.\nThe only question that remains is will macOS allow you to do this as the default folder structure in your user folder may be protected by the recently introduced \"SIP\" or System Integrity Protection system.\n", "Q: How can I save videos from iCloud Drive or Google Drive to photos on my iPhone? in the past I’ve been able to click a video in iCloud drive, and the option to ‘save to camera roll’ has been there.

I find myself often renaming documents from within the Open and Save As dialog box windows. I hope the description below makes sense to explain what I mean.\nIf you look carefully you can see the picture below is of the Open dialog box of Microsft Word in Windows.\n\nIn the example above, assume I was going to open the document called The Leadership Factor, but before I did this I realized that the filename of the document above was wrong. So I can click on this document (see how its highlighted) and if I want I can now rename it so that it ends with '2017' instead of '2013'. After renaming it, I can then click on the document called The Leadership Factor to open it up.\nCan I do the same thing in macOS?\n\nA: Right-click or control-click on the file to rename it from the open dialog.\n\n\nA: \nCan I do the same thing in macOS?\n\nYes and No. Let me explain.\nYes\nYou can do the same thing from within the Open dialogue window of an application, however it is not done by clicking on the filename to highlight it. Instead, you need to right-click on the filename and select Rename. This then highlights it and you can rename it as you wish.\nIf my explanation isn't clear, please let me know and I'll upload a couple of screenshots.\nNo\nUnfortunately, macOS does not allow you to rename a document from within the Save As dialogue window. This may actually be a bug because right-clicking on a filename does in fact give you the Rename option, it's just that it doesn't actually allow you to rename the document.\nIn fact, now that I'm thinking about this, I suggest you send in some feedback to Apple. When you do select Bug Report as your feedback type, and for feedback area select the Desktop/Finder/Filesystem option. I'll do the same, because you either shouldn't be able to select Rename from within the Save As dialogue window, or it should work since you can select it.\n", "Q: Why does the Messages app request access to your heart rate?

There you can press and hold two fingers until a heart shows up that will pulsate with your current heart-rate.\nThis can of course be considered a gimmick so if you do not want to allow messages to access your heart beat, you can just choose not to share it. The only consequence of that would be that, if you send a heart beat using that feature, it will not be synced to your actual heart beat but use a default value.\n", "Q: Safari only wants to connect to localhost via HTTPS Do a lot of local development and recently I've noticed that I cannot connect to non-HTTPS services running on localhost. If the services provide HTTPS then I am able to connect, but every time I try something like \"http://devsite:8000\", Safari always tries to access \"https://devsite.local:8000\".\nUsing Chrome, I can properly access the site.\nPerhaps the issue is HSTS?\nI am running Safari 10.1 on macOS Sierra.\n\nA: Actually, it looks like it was HSTS.\nI followed the directions posted here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Safari.\n\n*Delete the ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist file.\n\n*Reopen Safari.\n\n\nAnd now localhost sites are working correctly.\n", "Q: Change Permissions on macOS USB Device I need to find out how to set the permissions of a USB flash drive at the device (not filesystem) level.  In other words, I need to grant the user read/write access to a USB device identified by diskutil which is /dev/diskX where X is some integer.\nFor example, I insert a USB flash drive and according to diskutil it's identifier is /dev/disk5.  If I check the permissions of it:\n$ ls /dev/disk5*\nbrw-r-----  1 root  operator    1,  15 May 15 08:35 /dev/disk5\nbrw-r-----  1 root  operator    1,  16 May 15 08:35 /dev/disk5s1\nbrw-r-----  1 root  operator    1,  17 May 15 08:35 /dev/disk5s2\n\nIt has root:operator ownership and rw access limited to root and r access to operators only (this is why you must issue commands that modify the device as sudo).\nWhat I need to do is give rw access to the operator as well and it's not as simple as just chmod 660 /dev/disk5.  The moment you unplug the device and plug it back in, it loses the permissions.\nWhy do I need to do this?\nI need to boot a USB flash drive in VirtualBox.  To do so, I need to be able to create a \"raw\" disk image as a passthrough to the actual USB device.  The problem is, to do this, I must issue the command via sudo which then changes the user I am executing VBoxManage which causes a number of errors since root has an environment completely different than the logged in user.\nThis can be accomplished in FreeBSD (I am sure Linux as well via a different method) by modifying the devfs.rules file and adding in a line like:\nadd path 'da*' mode 0660 group operator\n\nWhich essentially gives rw access to any USB storage device (USB storage is identified by FreeBSD as /dev/da0, /dev/da1, etc.)\nHow do I do this on macOS?\n\nA: I was never able to find a way to get direct access to the raw device, however, VirtualBox has a \"raw disk access\" feature that allowed me to get around this problem.\nThe way this works is a VMDK drive is created that is actually mapped to a physical volume.  This acts as a passthrough so that VB can access a physical device.\nVBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename \"</path/to/file>.vmdk\" -rawdisk /dev/disk#\n\nFor example, if I had a physical USB device with an OS installer I could create a VMDK which I could attach to a VM.  \nExample:\nAssume a USB installer with macOS/FreeBSD/Linux/Windows.  To attach that physical USB to a VM (assuming /dev/disk3 is the USB device), \n\n\n*\n\n*Insert and unmount (not eject) the device.  \ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk3\n\n\n*Create the VMDK\nsudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename \"USB_OS_Installer.vmdk\" -rawdisk /dev/disk3\n\n\n*Take ownership of the VMDK (it was created as root via sudo; replace \"user\" with your username and leave the group \"staff\" as is)\nsudo chown user:staff USB_OS_Installer.vmdk\n\n\n*Attach the VMDK to the VM in VirtualBox's GUI. \nYou now have access to a physical boot media device through your VM.\n", "Q: mycingular.net did not encrypt this message, message sent as email I am receiving normal messages that should be arriving as txt instead on my personal email(gmail) messages from another Iphone User. They should be arriving as messages. He told me he sends the messages exactly the same way as if any txt to anybody else.\nHis phone is set as a backup for recovery of my gmail email. (only added this info in-case it is pertinent). I also own a iphone 5 with software ios at 7.0.4\nFor some reason eveytime he sends me a message from his iphone 6 it sends it like this. But if i initiate the message he then talks with me as if just any other txt(sms) to txt(sms) conversation.\nIs there something i can suggest for him to do to change on his phone so this doesn't happen anymore?  \n\nHere is what link appeared when i click on the encryption message in the picture: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6330403?visit_id=1-636304498701265550-1987472819&p=tls&hl=en&rd=1\nEdit: 5/16/17\nUPDATE\nTalked with my friend, we ran a few test scenario's everytime we tries to send me a direct txt to my phone line it still sends to my email. Does he have to delete my contact and re-enter it? This is really strange. \n\nA: I've had this happen a few times, and it's always been a problem with the carrier (not the phones or Apple's services). His carrier (Cingular) is sending the text message as if it were an email; this clear from the address @mms.att.net.\nThus, I suspect it has nothing to do with data in contacts apps on the phones. Similarly, the encryption warning is irrelevant.\nWhenever I've experienced this before, it has fixed itself. That is, suddenly texts begin working properly. \nYour friends should make sure he has run the latest updates on his iPhone. If that doesn't fix it, resetting network settings might force some carrier updates. (See Settings > General > Reset.)\n", "Q: Accidentally made mine and my brother's data exactly the same I plugged my phone to my brother's MacBook which has wiped my phone and store all of his data to mine. The thing is, I got it new, so I haven't back up any of it and the datas are so important. Is it possible for me to get my old datas back? If it is, how?\n\nA: If you have no backup of your phone then there is really no way to recover the data.\nData recovery works under the assumption that when you erase the file you just erase its entry in the filesystem, marking that space \"free to use.\" So the most important thing to do is don't use the device. If you write data to storage marked as empty chances are the data will be overwritten by the new data, making the old data non-recoverable.\nThis is what happened to your iPhone. It is unlikely that there is any way to recover your data and highlights the importance of turning on the option to back up to iCloud and to back up the phone to your computer so you have multiple redundant backups in case something like this happens.\n", "Q: What is the maximum number of spaces on Sierra? My MacBook runs Sierra 10.12.4 and I have 16 spaces, but there appears to be no way to get more. I find 16 spaces too few. Is 16 the absolute maximum or can I get more? If so how?\n\nA: Officially, 16 is the limit. A workaround to create more (which may be fixed later) is to enable ‘Displays have separate Spaces’ in Mission Control preference pane, then create spaces on an external display and disconnect the display, which moves the Spaces to the primary display.\n", "Q: Camera not working iPhone 5s My camera is not working, it just shows a black screen when I turn it on. Snapchat and instagram cameras aren't working as well.\nIn the restrictions the camera app was not restricted and still it's not working.\nCan anyone help me out?\n\nA: If the affected apps have permission to use the camera, try to force the iPhone to restart: hold down the Home Button and the Power Button at the same time until you see the Apple logo (about 10 seconds).\n\nA: You could try to reset your iphone and restore it from a backup or you could go to the store to see if they can do anything. It seems as if your Camera might be broken. If you have any insurance plan like apple care, they should probably replace your phone for you.\n", "Q: Set different volume for phone and clock On iOS, is there a way to set a different volume (loudness level) for the alarms I set in the 'Clock' app?  I'd like to lower the volume for the alarm I use to wake up in the morning, but without lowering the volume for when I am on a call.  Right now I have to remember to turn down the ringer volume setting each night, then turn it back up when I am talking on the phone.\nCan this be done?  I haven't found a way in the Settings app, but perhaps I'm just not looking in the right place.\n\nA: There is a free application, called Nightstand Central (the one with the moon symbol) that lets you set the volume of the alarm as you like without changing that of the iPhone.\n\nA: Alternative: make you own ringtone for alarm.\nAn iOS ringtone is a short (< 40s) m4a file in .m4r suffix.\nMake it with audio editor (e.g. Audacity). Drag it to iPhone with iTunes.\nIn Audacity, Amplify with a negative value to reduce the loudness\n\n\nA: For if the answer still hasn’t been found:\n\n*\n\n*Go to the clock app\n\n*Click “edit” and press on the alarm you want to adjust (not the red button)\n\n*“Sound” and click on the song you want to use\n\n*As the sound plays, adjust your volume using the volume buttons\n\nThis should lower or rise the volume of your alarm without affecting your call ringtone.\nSimilarly, you can use this to adjust the volume of new alarms.\n\nA: There are many different types of volume for iOS. They can all be adjusted with the two volume buttons (as long this is turned on in Settings>Sounds & Haptics>Change with Buttons).\nThe type of volume controlling your alarms is the Alert Volume. This can be changed by going to the clock app and adjusting volume. You will see a box with a bell labeled \"Ringer\".\nThe type of volume controlling your phone call volumes is a separate volume control that can be changed by placing a call (I just call myself) and using the volume buttons during the call. You will see a box with a speaker labeled \"Volume\".\n\nA: I believe the clock alarm volume changes if you lower the volume for videos, games, etc... unfortunately you need to remember to turn it back up after. Pretty stupid imo.\n", "Q: Insert dots at the end of a phrase I need some help with a table of contents.\nI'm trying to automatically add dots (take a look at red rectangles) at the end of a phrase with the number of the page, as shown in this example image I have found in the internet:\n\n\nA: To add the dots to your table of contents, select the table, choose the Text inspector, then select the leader as dots.\n                                                  \nIf you don't have a table of contents, place the cursor where you wish to insert the table of contents, then Insert → Table of Contents and choose the scope.\n       \n\nA: I just found what I was looking for:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH23640?locale=en_US\nThank you all.\n", "Q: Smart cropping of images and add border I need to perform batch cropping to approximately 3000 images.

Short answer: it can't be done.\nOnce you create an iCloud email account, that account can't be changed or removed from your Apple ID. The only way to delete the email account would be to delete the entire Apple ID account.\n", "Q: Why don't my Photos sort correctly by date? Using OS 10.12.4 and Photos 2.0 (3150.4.120).\nI imported a bunch of photos recently, and selected View > Sort > \"Keep Sorted by Oldest First\".\nMost of them appear in the correct order, but a few are out of order. If I do Get Info on them, I can see that certain photos have a later date than photos appearing later in the album.\nIs this sort order based on a different date? How can I make them appear in the right order? Or is this just a bug in Photos (in which case I'll abandon hope)?\nIt also uses this same incorrect order on iOS 10.3.1, when I sync them to my iPhone.\nI tried putting them in a new album, as well as creating a Smart Album with the photos, but the same order persists.\n\nA: Okay, I solved the mystery.\nAll of the photos in question were taken when I was on vacation, and my phone's time zone was set to the \"away\" time zone. Most of the photos were correctly saved with that time zone.\nBut for some reason, a few photos (the out-of-order ones) were saved with my \"home\" time zone. These photos also had no GPS location saved, so I assume this is a bug that happens when it can't find your GPS location.\nInterestingly, the out-of-order photos did have the correct time, for the \"away\" time zone. It was just the time zone itself that was off. That's why it wasn't obvious that their time was wrong; Photos doesn't normally display the time zone. The only way to find out is to select \"Adjust Date and Time\", since that dialog shows you the photo's current time zone.\nTo fix this, I had to find all the out-of-order photos. Since Photos has no obvious way to filter Smart Albums by time zone, I filtered by \"Photo is not tagged with GPS\". (EDIT: I ended up writing a script to find them, since this didn't find all the right ones.)\nI selected these photos, selected \"Adjust Date and Time\", entered the \"away\" time zone, then adjusted the time back to the original. That way it changed the time zone without affecting the actual time.\nAfterwards, my photos were sorted correctly.\n", "Q: Add Directory Service to macOS image I'm trying to add an Active Directory service to macOS image. I know how to bind AD on a Mac but I was looking for an automated way to do it for a large deployment 50–100 Macs, i.e add it in an image profile. What's the best practice for this?\n\nA: Depends on how you created the image.\nIf you're using the installer as your source then there's a pane for adding directory servers.\nIf you're using an installed system as the source then you may have to use something like the dsconfigad command in a script to bind.\n", "Q: Sierra frozen at login screen - keyboard and mouse unresponsive After rebooting my MBPr, it is now frozen at the login screen showing the list of users.

It turns out I had some bad third-party kexts installed in /System/Library/Extensions.  Removed those and now all is well.\n\nA: I've had this happen a couple of times after messing around with betas, cloning from one machine to another, or after \"awkward\" updates (where things don't seem quite right after the update finally finishes). It is usually fixed by resetting the SMC (which is different than zapping PRAM/NVRAM).\nFrom an OSX Daily Post:\n\nThis is how to reset SMC on most modern Mac laptops, none of which\nhave a removable battery:\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your MacBook Air / MacBook Pro\n\n*Connect the power adapter to the Mac\n\n*On the MacBook / Pro’s keyboard, hold down the Shift+Control+Option keys and the Power button at the same time\n\n*Release all keys and the power button at the same time – the little\nlight on the MagSafe adapter may change colors briefly to indicate the\nSMC has reset\n\n*Boot your Mac as usual\n\nHere’s the key sequence to hold down:\n\nReset the SMC of a MacBook Air or Retina MacBook Pro\nDo keep in mind that by resetting the SMC you will lose power specific\nsettings, like the time it takes to sleep a Mac and other\ncustomizations to power settings. No big deal, but if you have made\nmany changes to your hardware behavior you will want to adjust stuff\nlike sleep behavior again.\nThe boot time after resetting a machines SMC can be a bit longer than\nusual, that is normal.\n\nIt looks like you've used recovery mode to do disk repairs. I suspect Recovery mode is loading a different copy of the drivers than your main partition, which is why it works there but not in Safe Mode and \"normal\" mode.\nIf your concern about reinstalling (should the SMC reset not work) is that you don't want to risk losing data or having to start from scratch, a reinstall from recovery mode won't wipe the disk or mess up your account. Everything will be there like it should be when it's done. I've done that several times too.\nYou could also try remoting in from another machine using VNC or Screen Sharing, presuming you have those set up, or have SSH enabled so you can log in and kick start Apple Remote Desktop.\n\nA: It may be to do with your Login Password.

I know this is maybe a duplicate and I really read a lot of similar threads but either the answer isn't working anymore or I don't see how the answer is working.\nI already figured out that apple wants me to use launchd. Most of the other solutions don't work anymore anyway.\nSo I found this answer but as far as I see launchd does everything when the system starts. I will copy the code below\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n<key>Label</key><string>boot.shutdown.script.name</string>\n\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n  <string>SCRIPT_PATH/boot-shutdown.sh</string>\n</array>\n\n<key>RunAtLoad</key>\n<true/>\n\n<key>StandardOutPath</key>\n<string>LOG_PATH/boot-shutdown.log</string>\n\n<key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n<string>LOG_PATH/boot-shutdown.err</string>\n\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nand the script\n#!/bin/bash\nfunction shutdown()\n{\n\n  # INSERT HERE THE COMMAND YOU WANT EXECUTE AT SHUTDOWN OR SERVICE UNLOAD\n\n  exit 0\n}\n\nfunction startup()\n{\n\n  # INSERT HERE THE COMMAND YOU WANT EXECUTE AT STARTUP OR SERVICE LOAD\n\n  tail -f /dev/null &\n  wait $!\n}\n\ntrap shutdown SIGTERM\ntrap shutdown SIGKILL\n\nstartup;\n\nUnfortunately there is no tutorial for launchd which include very basic explanation. So for example the arguments of the key brackets are more than just strings they trigger something but I can't find a list of which words trigger which action.\nI would like to understand the basic idea of launchd. Especially which are the commands for running a script when the systems starts and when the systems shuts down.\n\nA: I think I would approach this differently to what you're doing, but then again my suggestion is a bit of a workaround compared to what you want.\nMy approach would be to have your script set up so that it triggers the shutdown as part of its code. In other words, instead of having the Shutdown trigger the script, have the script trigger the shutdown. \nThe advantage of this is that you can use this as your usual shutdown option if you want, but if you ever need to shutdown without also running your script you can (e.g. if you're having to shutdown multiple times for troubleshooting purposes, or if an installation automatically shuts down your Mac, etc).\nIf this is an acceptable option for you, then the Applescript code you need is as follows:\ntell application \"Finder\" to shut down\n\nIn other words, you effectively need to add the above code to whatever your script is. \nOnce your script works as you want, I would then create an Automator Service that runs it. This isn't mandatory, but it does mean you'll be able to run your script from the Application menu of any application. And, it also means you can create a keyboard shortcut to trigger it.\nIf either or both of these options interest you, proceed below.\n1. Create a service using Automator\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator (usually found within your Applications folder)\n\n*Go to File > New\n\n*Select Service and click Choose\n\n*In the top right hand of the window that appears, ensure that \"No input\" is selected from the Service receives drop-down list\n\n*Ensure the In drop-down list is showing \"Any application\"\n\n*In the second column containing the long list, find \"Run AppleScript\" and double-click on it\n\n*This will add the Run AppleScript window on the right\n\n*Now, replace the (* Your script goes here *) with your script \n\n*Save the service using a meaningful name (e.g. ShutMeDown).\n\n\nNow you should be able to run the service (and therefore your script) from any application by going to the Services list within any Application menu (e.g. Finder > Services, Safari > Services, TextEdit > Services, etc) and select the service you just created. \nIf you'd also like to set a keyboard shortcut to trigger things, proceed below.\n2. Creating a keyboard shortcut\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n*Select Services from the sidebar\n\n*Find your service (it'll be in the list on the right-hand side)\n\n*Add a shortcut by double clicking on the service name\n\n*Now go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy\n\n*Select Accessibility in the sidebar\n\n*Click on the + sign (you may need to unlock the padlock if it's locked)\n\n*Add Automator.\n\n*Add Finder (to find this you will need to navigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app).\n\n*Exit your System Preferences.\n\n\nNow you should be able to use the keyboard shortcut to run the service (and therefore your script).\nNOTE: I am aware that for some users keyboard shortcuts do not seem to work even though they've been assigned to a service. This is a whole other topic, but if this happens in your case, at least you can run the service from within any application you're using.\nIf you decide to give this approach a go, feel free to comment me if you have any questions/problems.\n\nA: I will tell what I figured out so far:\nAs mentioned in this Run script before shutdown you can use a logouthook to achieve the goal. However, apple stopped the support of rc.shutdown and maybe will do the same to logouthook. The alternative apple is offering is launchd but I couldn't find a command which let me execute a script just before logout.\nlaunchd works fine as substitute for a loginhook or cronjobs. Nevertheless there is a workaround so that you can use it instead of a logouthook. The solution is already posted in my question. I just want to mention how it works:\nIn fact the script will be executed when the computer launches but the trap command waits for the shutdown signal so that the desired function will be executed when the signal is sent.\n", "Q: Validate signature on Apple updates I had a short window of opportunity to install the 10.12.5 update today, but the update wasn't showing up on the App Store, so I decided to download it directly.

My company develops an app that needs to be deployed internally (outside the App store). To do so, we need an Apple Developer Enterprise account.\nWe went through the process of getting a DUNS number for our business (a registered LLC) and making sure it met Apple's requirements.\nAfter the account sat in pending status for weeks, Apple informed me over the phone that, after internal review, our application was denied. They could not provide any additional information, nor outline the criteria for entry into the program. The stated conclusively that we would not be able to get an account, without providing a reason.\nDoes anyone know the best way to appeal this rejection?\n\nA: How many employees do you have as an LLC that only just created their DUNS? A dozen? Installing your app on a dozen devices without enterprise license but just the developer license is no problem at all. \nThere have been a few cases recently where enterprise licenses have been abused to distribute malware, so Apple will have some rather high standards for enterprise licenses. \n\nA: The good news is you can now start development and load apps on your personal devices without needing to pay $99. Similarly, the $99 developer account can now upload apps to TestFlight and have thousands of testers and then upgrade to the $299 Enterprise account only if they can’t figure out how to make the standard account work.\nI get why people would go for enterprise initially a few years back but not it’s silly to not just make your apps as a standard developer and then transfer or upgrade to enterprise only when you really need to. You can push realistic apps through test flight and also through VPP / Apple Business Manager now without needing an enterprise account. You can notarize Mac apps soon with 10.14 and self distribute them. So many changes in the last 24 months (as I write this in August 2018) make the normal developer account so much more capable for businesses use across hundreds of end users of apps.\nApple in fact just takes enterprise applications that are premature and converts them into the $99 account so you can get started now when you don’t qualify from the looks of your application for enterprise.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Apple have administrative control over Developer program enrollment?\n", "Q: LG 5k display as docking station for multiple MacBooks Is it possible to connect an Apple mouse and keyboard to the LG UltraFine 5k display via Bluetooth, and then interchangeably connect separate MacBook Pro's to the display without have to reconnect the keyboard and mouse to them?\nI have separate MacBook Pro's for personal and work, and I'm hoping the display itself can serve as a docking station.

If no simple solution exists, could this be done some elaborate way via scripting?\n\nA: I don't know much about Macs but this is how I got it to work with VLC (generic options described below also):\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the AirPods bluetooth options to open Siri on double tap\n\n*Have something running in the background checking if Siri is open\n\n*If it is open, execute Play/Pause and close it, then go back to checking if Siri is open\n\n\nThese are the two scripts required to get the above working:\nMacBook-Pro:~ user$ cat airpods_controller\n#!/bin/sh\nwhile :; do\n    pid=$(ps x |grep Siri.app|grep -v grep|awk '{print $1}')\n    if [ -n \"$pid\" ]; then\n        kill -9 $pid\n        osascript -e 'tell application \"VLC\" to play'\n    fi\n    sleep .5\ndone\n\nMacBook-Pro:~ user$ cat airpods_controller_launcher \n#!/bin/sh\nps x |grep airpods_controller|wc -l|grep 2\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    nohup ./airpods_controller &\nfi\n\nTo have it start automatically, just add airpods_controller_launcher to your startup items under Mac Settings and it's hands off from there. Check the checkbox to make it hide on startup and in Terminal options, set the terminal to close on success if you don't want the window to hang around.\nTo get it working by simulating media keys instead of osascript (to be more generic), the following looks like it would work:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/13396296/494354\nTo get it working with Chrome and some other apps, this may help: https://github.com/beardedspice/beardedspice\n\nA: It works just fine with applications like\n\n\n*\n\n*QuickTime Player.app\n\n*the Lynda.com app from the Mac App Store\n\n*YouTube videos played in Safari\n\n\nHowever, it does not work with these applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*QuickTime Player 7\n\n*Vox (audio player)\n\n*VLC\n\n*MplayerX\n\n", "Q: External Bluetooth Microphone - iPad I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones with a microphone and I want to use the microphone on the Bluetooth headphones to record some audio into an audio recording app on the iPad. I have tried multiple apps so this isn't the problem. \nMy problem is the iPad won't pick up the audio from the microphone on the Bluetooth headphone. I know that the audio from the microphone can be picked up by the iPad as there is an option when you are face-timing to change the input source. \nHow can I change the input for the audio in the iPad settings?\n\nA: I am in a nearly identical situation as you. I have been manically searching for this answer for the past two days, finding little. But here is what little I've found:\nThe Bluetooth mic is used during phone calls, facetime, and speech-to-text. It is not used for anything related to recording, as if the software is only ok with using that input if the evidence is destroyed immediately, if no record is kept. Wired headphones that have mics built-in will work for recordings, but for some reason the Bluetooth headsets are treated differently. This is true for my iPad mini and for my Android phone.\nThe most plausible theory I've heard is that there might be some safety regulation that is responsible. Like the government thinks it would be too easy to eavesdrop on people through their headsets if they didn't make these restrictions. But that is just speculation.\nAnyway, I hope I was able to tell you something you didn't already know. I will be anxiously monitoring your post to see if someone who knows more than me shares new information. Good luck!!\n", "Q: Data backup needed before Apple Store screen repair?

I have asked this question over on Mac Rumors, but received zero responses at this time. Please feel free to redirect me to a more appropriate S.E. site if there is a more suitable one. \nI have seen many threads over the net about iPhone7 WiFi connectivity issues, but none of the answers for theirs have fixed my issue.\nProblem:\nWe have an issue at home where the two iPhone 7s often will not connect or if they do connect, wont hold a connection for very long (10 - 20 minutes).\nWe have multiple other devices, both Apple and non-Apple who connect fine and hold their connection. It is only the two iPhone 7s which are experiencing this issue. The iPhone 6, iPhone 5, iPad 2, iPad mini, iMac, two Android phones, one Android tablet and Windows laptop all connect without issue.\nWiFi Infrastructure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sky Broadband SR102, connected to internet and working as Fibre broadband modem, DHCP server and WiFi access point and router\n\n*Sky Broadband SR102, connected to SR102 by LAN cable, DHCP disabled, working as WiFi access point and router\n\n*NetGear WNR2200, connected to SR102 by LAN cable, DHCP disabled, working as WiFi access point and router. Also has Guest account enabled.\n\n\nAll WiFi access points have the same SID broadcast, the same encryption type and same password. All three broadcast on different channels, which only overlap slightly according to “WiFi Analyser” application. All WiFi is 2.4GHz. No 5Ghz in house.\n\nOften when the iPhone has no connection the IP address is well outside of the DHCP range. Often something like 169.254.xxx.xxx. I understand from other threads this is an IP address the iPhone assigns its self when it cannot get one from the DCHP server. Sometimes the IP address is just plain 0.0.0.0.\nSolutions which have not worked for us are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnecting and reconnecting WiFi on iPhone7\n\n*Renewing the lease on the iPhone7\n\n*Restarting the iPhone7\n\n*Forgetting WiFi network and re-adding it on iPhone7\n\n*Restarting all of the routers\n\n*Allowing SR102 to dynamically assign all IP addresses\n\n*Giving all frequently active devices in house static IP addresses in the device access list on the SR102. The static IP addresses are based upon MAC address. The  SR102 still hands out dynamic IP addresses to any other device.\n\n*Setting static IP addresses (to match those set on SR102) on iPhone7s\n\n*Resetting network settings on iPhone7\n\n*Turning Bluetooth off on iPhone7 (advice from forum posts - not practical and did not work)\n\n*Disconnect all IP6 DHCP on routers\n\n\nWe have also been to the Apple store and had twenty minutes with a genius, but after running a diagnostic tool on phone he was unable to offer anything other than what we had already tried except a full factory reset to new phone state, which is less than ideal for us.\nI have seen posts around the net where other iPhone7 users having this issue can be sat next to partners with iPhone6, iPhone5, Android phones or iPads who can connect perfectly. It seems to be quite a common affliction to the iPhone7.  Please can anyone offer any other advice? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: It seems as though it's an issue with your local network. You may want to take a look into your 2.4GHz settings, and change them to Apple's Specified 20 MHz bandwith.  \n\n2.4 GHz channel width\nChannel width controls how large of a ”pipe” is available to transfer data. However, larger channels are more subject to interference and more likely to interfere with other devices. A 40 MHz channel is sometimes called a wide channel, and a 20 MHz channel is a narrow channel.\n\nSet to: 20 MHz\n\nUse 20 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Using 40 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band can cause performance and reliability issues with your network, especially in the presence of other Wi-Fi networks and other 2.4 GHz devices. A 40 MHz channel might also cause interference and issues with other devices that use this band, such as Bluetooth devices, cordless phones, and neighboring Wi-Fi networks. Routers that don't support 40 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band do support 20 MHz channels.\n\nIf you choose to use the 5GHz channel width, it is reccomended that you use the 20/40 MHz band.\n\n5 GHz channel width\nChannel width controls how large of a \"pipe\" is available to transfer data. Larger channels are more susceptible to interference, and more likely to interfere with other devices. Interference is less of an issue in the 5 GHz band than in the 2.4 GHz band. A 40 MHz channel is sometimes called a wide channel, and a 20 MHz channel is a narrow channel.\n  Set to:\n\nFor 802.11n access points, set the 5GHz band to 20 MHz and 40 MHz.\nFor 802.11ac access points, set the 5GHz band to 20 MHz, 40 MHz, and 80 MHz.\n\nFor best performance and reliability, enable support for all channel widths. This allows devices to use the largest width they support, which results in optimal performance and compatibility. Not all client devices support 40 MHz channels, so don't enable 40 MHz-only mode. Devices that support only 20 MHz channels cant connect to a Wi-Fi router in 40 MHz-only mode. Similarly, don't enable 80 MHz-only mode, or only clients capable of 802.11ac will be able to connect. Routers that don't support 40 MHz or 80 MHz channels do support 20 MHz channels.\n\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202068\n\nA: Comments from a former work colleague who read my problem:\n\nyes you definitely have a weird issue there. The fact you get a\n  169.254.x.x address means that it is unable to get a lease from the router as you correctly said. Possible issues for this are: unable to\n  reach the dhcp server, e.g. it's in a different VLAN, the lease\n  addresses have all been issued, the dhcp server no longer works\n  correctly. However we can rule most of them out by the information\n  provided.\nI would advise checking the scope to make sure it's nice and big e.g.\n  /24 to give you 253 usable addresses. Another thing I have noticed in\n  the past is that apple devices much prefer 5ghz networks and always\n  try to connect to them. I don't think it will be long before they turn\n  off the 2.4 spectrum altogether.\nAnother possibility is interference all Wi-Fi channels should be non\n  overlapping to do this either set channel 1,6 or 11 depending on which\n  one is less congested. Any slight overlapping gives the potential for\n  interference. Other than that I don't really have any better ideas\n  without getting any real information. It may be worth looking at the\n  logs of the AP to see if the iPhone disassociates or whether the AP\n  kicks it off.\n\nIP Scope\nThe scope of DHCP is very wide from 192.168.0.02 to 192.168.0.254 with around thirty of those IPs set statically by the SR102 router. So there should be plenty available for the router to give out. Plus the two iPhone7s have been given static IPs in the router based upon MAC address of the phone.\nChannels\nMy channels are a little close as they are set to auto in each access point so they look for the least congested channel. I may split 1,6,11 as suggested above.\n\nEDIT: I did split channels to 1, 6 and 11, and although that seemed to work initially after a day it was all pretty much back to the \"norm\" with the two iPhone 7s not getting IP addresses from the router / APs.\n\nA: I've never heard of a router prioritizing devices but maybe they are running out of leases. Can you try to disconnect a bunch of devices & then see if you can replicate it again?\nWhen I worked at AppleCare I did see a case where an odd character in a SSID caused connection issues - try making the SSID all numbers & letters only if they aren't already.\nI'm also curious if this would happen with only one router plugged in. Maybe something is going wrong when they try to switch to a different router. If this ends up working I would try a separate name for each SSID, iPhones should still always try and connect to the one with the strongest signal.\n", "Q: My Spotify app won't open, can't be deleted and won't force quit on macOS ...and yet when I try to, a dialogue box tells me I can't delete it because it's already open.\nAny ideas what I can do?\n\nA: Make sure Spotify isn't in your login items (System Preferences → Users & Groups) so it won't automatically start. Log out, making sure to uncheck ‘Reopen windows when logging back in’, then log back in. Try to delete the app now.\n", "Q: How to disagree to iTunes privacy policy? I accidentally pressed that I agree to iTunes tos when I opened the app on Mac os Sierra. The fact is I don't agree to the tos. How can I get the dialog option back? I don't plan to use iTunes.\n\nA: When you open iTunes for the first time and agree to the license agreement, it creates the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist file with a dictionary entry called license-agreements. You can just delete the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist file if you have no intension of using iTunes and it will be as if you never agreed to the license agreement.\nIn Terminal:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist\n\nIf you just want to delete the license-agreements use:\ndefaults delete com.apple.itunes license-agreements\n\n\nIf you want to remove the iTunes app in macOS, you should be able to just move it to the Trash and then empty the Trash. I was able to do that in macOS 10.12.3, however you might have to disable System Integrity Protection and if so, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your Mac.\n\n*Start up from macOS Recovery using: Command-R\n\n*Select your Language and press Enter.\n\n*At macOS Utilities, select Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n\n*In Terminal type, csrutil disable then press Enter.\n\n*In Terminal type, reboot then press Enter.\n\n*Once back in normal mode macOS, in Terminal use the following command:\nsudo rm -fr /Applications/iTunes.app\n\n\n*Then press Enter, type your password, then press Enter again.\n\n\nDon't forget to enable System Integrity Protection afterwards. Repeat the necessary steps, however use csrutil enable.\n\nA: It is likely that the only way to un-ring that bell would be to back up your files and create a new account on your Mac, migrate those files, and delete the old profile. You could then launch iTunes and disagree but I believe all that does is just quit the app, so if you launch it again it will ask, again, if you agree.\nAnd iTunes like most of the apps that come with macOS can't be deleted.\n", "Q: Using AppleScript to batch convert .pages to pdf I am needing to convert about 100 .pages documents to either pdf or docx.\nWith the AppleScript script below, I am able to open .pages documents from the folder that I select.

I can find the time zone for an individual photo, by selecting Image > Adjust Date and Time.\nBut how can I find all photos with a certain time zone? I've tried searching in the Finder, in the photos' filesystem metadata (using mdls), in the photos' EXIF metadata (using exiftool), and even in the Photos sqlite database, but haven't found where it's stored.\nWhere is this information?\n\nA: It may depend on the camera/phone and OS; but, I don't think the timezone is explicitly stored in the picture's EXIF metadata.\nIn some metadata, there is a GPS Time (Atomic Clock) which is set to UTC.  So, Photos probably just calculates the offsets of Date and Time (Original) to display the timezone.\nYou may be able to use exiftool to build a list of those two times for your pictures, and search for outliers which are more (or less) different than the others.\nUpdate from original poster:\nI threw together a quick Python script to compare these times, and print the ones that aren't in the expected time zone, or have different values for minutes. You'll need to export the unmodified originals from Photos, since the modified ones don't have this metadata, and then pass their filenames to this script.\nOf course, I have no idea if this is anything close to what Photos does to set the time zone.

While the auto updates worked well, signing into the App Store with my Apple ID did not work. \nI successfully logged into https://appleid.apple.com with the same password. I re-checked all my details. I then changed my password in my Apple Account Manager at the above url and re-entered it in the App Store after I shut the App Store down and reopened it. However, it would not let me enter with the new (or old password).\nObviously I am perplexed, frustrated and annoyed by this.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how I can address this?\n\nA: Just a thought but maybe its signed in already on another account and needs to be signed out first. On the Store menu make sure that you aren't already signed into an account and if so sign out and try signing back in. It may work then again it may not. Just something you could try.\n", "Q: Running a .jar on a Mac I've recently been wishing I could still play a Minigolf game that came installed with my first cell phone, a Sony Ericsson T610 (eat your heart out, iPhone!), which roughly looked like this:\n\n'Member?\nThere are good reasons to believe that the game is \"abandonware\" and that Sony Ericsson doesn't offer support for it anymore.\nI think the game can be found as a .jar file online, and is either this one or this one. \nHowever, after downloading these files, I haven't been able to run them. Java is installed in the /Library folder of the Macintosh HD drive, and when I right-click the file to open it, I get a \"The Java JAR file “Real_Minigolf_2005_128x128_SE_K300i-448093.jar” could not be launched. Check the Console for possible error messages.\" error message.\nI have looked into this answer and this one, but neither have worked.\nIs it possible to run these files on a Mac running El Capitan or above?\n\nA: In general, you run a ‘runnable JAR’ by opening it or with Terminal java -jar /path/to/game.jar.\nHowever, this JAR does not contain a suitable manifest for launching, i.e. not a runnable JAR.\n$ java -jar /path/to/game.jar  \nno main manifest attribute, in /path/to/game.jar\n\nTherefore you have to specify the main class manually. However, that still doesn't work.\n$ java -cp /path/to/game.jar E\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/microedition/lcdui/Graphics\n[…]\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics\n[…]\n\nThat's because this JAR doesn't support being run on a computer. It's a game for a mobile device and you can't launch it on a computer.\n", "Q: How to import photos+videos from iphone with IOS 7.0.4? Trying to import this with the Photos app on mac sierra v.10.12.1. When I go to the import option the iphone is not showing up? How can I import my photos & videos to my mac? What other way is there to try?\n\nA: You can use the Photos app to import photos from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your Mac without using iCloud Photo Library. These steps also work for importing images from digital cameras and SD cards. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you have the latest version of iTunes on your Mac. Importing photos to your Mac requires iTunes 12.5.1 or later.\n\n*Connect your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or digital camera to your Mac with a USB cable. If you're using an SD card, insert it into the SD slot on your Mac, or connect it using a card reader.\n\n*You might need to unlock your iOS device using your passcode. You might also see a prompt on the iOS device asking you to Trust This Computer. Tap Trust to continue.\n\n*On your Mac, the Photos app automatically opens. If it doesn't, open the Photos app.\n\n*The Photos app shows an Import screen with all the photos and videos that are on your connected device. If the Import screen doesn't automatically appear, click the Import tab at the top of the Photos app, or click the device's name in the Photos sidebar.\n\n*To import a selection of photos, click the ones you want, then click Import Selected. To import all new photos, click Import All New Photos.\n\n", "Q: Apple mail with multiple accounts, sender not correct I have multiple accounts set-up on my iMac.  I'm running the latest OS X Sierra.  \nWhen I draft an email I select the account and this updates the sender email address, all is good.\nHowever when I send the email, the email is sent not from the sender that was displayed whilst drafting the email but from the first account in my list.\nWhy?  Can I fix this or is it a bug?\n\nA: I posted this same question to the Apple community and yesterday I got an answer which has solved the problem.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7956716\n", "Q: How do I do a right click on a 'magic mouse'? We’ve just won a brand new iMac. It came with an Apple keyboard, Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad. The keyboard works well, although it's weird not having a numeric keypad. The trackpad also works well.\nBut while the mouse seems to connect fine and I can scroll and click ok, for the life of me I cannot figure out how to do right-clicking on the mouse?\nI did try looking for a Control Panel to try and fix this, but there isn’t one.\n\nA: There is no Control Panel like in Windows or the old Classic Mac OS systems of years ago. Instead, what macOS has are System Preferences. You can access this from the Apple Menu and selecting the System Preferences… option.\nOnce you do you’ll see a list of Preferences Panes you can access by using a single mouse click. There are two you can utilise to address your issue, because both the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad can be set up to do what you’re calling a right-click. \nBelow are screenshots of both the Mouse and Trackpad preference panes:\n\n\nNote that when you look at both these preference panes you will see options for a Secondary click.  This is the setting that will enable the right-click you’re looking for.\nI suggest while you’re in System Preferences you also have a play with what else is available.\nFinally, you may find the Mac tips for Windows switchers site of great interest to you.\n\nA: Hold down the ⌃CTRL key and click with the mouse. This will act as a right click.\nOr you can set it up thru  Apple menu → System Preferences... → Mouse and check Secondary Click. \n\nA: two finger tap on the pad is equivalent to right click with a mouse  \n", "Q: Why are inline images not visible in Mail on macOS Sierra? I'm on Sierra 10.12.3 and Mail wont display inline images. I already Googled for an answer and found a lot of stuff, but no solution so far. \nFor Yosemite I found this but can't find the option \"Automatically detect and maintain account settings\" in Sierra. Is it gone?\nI already have \"Display remote images in html messages\" checked.\n\nA: Did you enable Load remote content in messages in Mail Preferences > Viewing ?\n\nAutomatically detect and maintain account settings isn't related to your question.\n\nA: It seems to be an issue with the current version of macOS. According to the 10.12.4 update description page, it fixes issues with displaying e-mail contents badly. Try updating to that and then see if the issue persists.\n\nA: I was having a similar problem and was looking for an answer, but I found it myself in the process. It turns out my ad blocker, AdGuard, is able to apply its rules to the contents of mail messages too, and apparently the servers that host images for some marketing emails (which I legitimately want to receive) are on one of AdGuard's blacklists. After temporarily disabling AdGuard and re-opening the email message, the images displayed correctly for me. So I figured I'd post this discovery in case it helps anyone else.\ntl;dr: Try disabling any ad blocker software you may have installed.\n", "Q: Add ‘Good News' voice to \"Say\" commands I recall having 'Good News' and 'Bad News' voices for say commands on my older Mac, but now I don't have these. Where can I get them?\n\nA: Both of the other answers here refer users to System Preferences > Accessibility and, while there, to either Speech or Voice in the lefthand pane.\nHowever, it is entirely possible you won't have these options. If this is the case, you can download voices instead via the following process: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Accessibility\n\n*Select Voiceover in the lefthand pane\n\n*Now on the righthand side, click on the Open VoiceOver Utility... button\n\n*After the Voiceover Utility opens, select the Speech option in the lefthand pane\n\n*On the righthand side you'll now see a drop-down menu under the Voices heading\n\n*From this menu select Customize...\n\n*Now you'll see a window from which you can select voices to download\n\n*Select the voice(s) you want to download\n\n*Click OK\n\n*The voice(s) you selected will begin downloading. Once they're downloaded you will see them appear in the drop-down menu under the Voices heading.\n\n\nA quicker option\nAnother process you can follow to download voices is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Dictation & Speech\n\n*Select the Text to Speech tab\n\n*From the System Voice drop-down menu select Customize...\n\n*Now you'll see a window from which you can select voices to download\n\n*Select the voice(s) you want to download\n\n*Click OK\n\n*The voice(s) you selected will begin downloading. Once they're downloaded you will see them appear in the System Voice drop-down menu\n\n\nA: AFAIK, Apple removed the Novelty sounds.

Usually, these will auto-download the update and ask you to restart the application to apply the update. Sometimes this is handled in the application menu bar, and sometimes there will be an in-app pop-up asking you to restart the application.\n\nHowever, no matter how many times I restart the application, the update will never be applied, so it starts to download the update anew and ask again to restart the application.\nSome examples of applications I'm having problems with are: Atom Editor, Slack (Web DL version), and a few others.\nI read somewhere that this might be related to SIP protection that was introduced with El Capitan, and that only root users can use that particular flavour of auto-update now. Is this correct?\nMy main user is not an admin user. Instead I need to invoke my admin user's authorization when admin privileges are required. I don't know if that has anything to do with the issue – the in-app updates never asks for admin privileges.\nWith that in mind, I'd like to avoid disabling SIP protection if possible.\nEdit: system.log example\nUnfortunately, I was quicker than the first comment below, and against that advice I installed cask. So now the problematic applications like Atom and Slack, are currently at their latest version. However, I appear to have a similar problem with a new app called RealTime Board. Where Atom and Slack auto-updates via the file menu and then asks for a restart, RealTime Board downloads the update and asks for a restart via a pop-up. So I suspect it works much in the same way as those other applications I've been having problems with. Again, the app update refuses to apply upon restart, and will continuously ask me to update & restart via a pop-up on app launch. I will have to wait and see how Atom and Slack behaves once new versions are available.

I've never heard about cask before, but I use Homebrew. Could it be an advisable solution?\n\nA: You need admin permissions to write to /Applications – that's why the update is failing. Try running the app through Terminal:\nsudo path/to/app/Contents/MacOS/appname.\nOr just use an administrator account.\n", "Q: Change volume range for sound? (i.e. dB-range for slider) I have an issue where the \"slider\" for volume is near unusable for a USB-headset. Only the first four mini-steps (see Lowest volume is still too loud—how can I make it even lower?) are somehow valid volume ranges, the rest are way too high. \nIn the MIDI-control I can see that the dB-range is from -37 dB (0-volume) to -0 dB (1-volume, or max, the scale is between 0 and 1). With mini-steps (see above) the increment is 0.016-volume, but the first step from 0 to 0.016 gets the dBs from -37 to -32.37, and each following mini-step is roughly 0.5 dBs closer to 0.\nI want the volume slider to step between -37 and -18 dBs instead of -32.37 (the lowest mini-step with sound) to 0. Is this doable somehow using the normal vol up / vol down keys?\nAs a comment, I think the actual dB-values are way off, but that probably depends on the fact that it is a USB-headset.\nEdit\nAdded image below, note that this is set manually, I cannot get it this low with volume keys. Lowest with volume keys is \"value\" at 0.016 and db at -32.37, whilst I'd like 0.001 and db at -36 as I have now (via applescript).\n \n\nA: I also had this Problem a years ago by then I found no way to do it with OS X Onboard Tools didn't even try nor know the AppleScript Workaround (this would have been enough for me i think) anyway.\nMy Solution I ended Up using was to use Soundflower https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/ a Software based 2 or 64 Channel Audiorouting Tool.\nMaybe it also had some inpact on my decision to use it that I already used it for Music Production.\nI think the Way I used it to do what you're looking for was as follows:\nSoundflower shows up as 2 Separate Audio Devices on the Audio-Midi-Setup a 2Channel and a 64Channel Device both with individual Soundlevel Sliders.\nSo I just set the System Out under Systemsettings to Soundflower 2Channel and then set a Audio Level on the Soundflower 2Channel Device.\nBy that time Soundflower was a free Tool don't know if its still free and also am not 100% shure if I really only used Soundflower back then or together with Jack http://www.jackosx.com.\nAs I said it was years ago and I can't remember all exactly also I now have different Audio Setup much more complex so i'm currently not able to try it out by myself.\nHope it still helps you.\n", "Q: Will Updating macOS delete Bootcamp Windows? I wish to update my Macbook Pro from El Capitan to Sierra. But I'm afraid it would remove files from my Windows 10 running on Bootcamp. Will it by any means, delete my data from the Bootcamp Partition? \n\nA: Updating macOS should not impact data on any other partitions on your disk.\nNevertheless it's always a good idea to ensure you have a backup of everything important before performing major maintenance activities (as e.g. an OS upgrade).\n\nA: It will not delete your Bootcamp partition unless you do a clean install and delete your bootcamp partition from Recovery Mode (partition).\n", "Q: Is there any way to control Mac volume from Apple Watch? Is there a way to control a Mac's audio volume from Apple Watch? Apple didn't provide Watch functionality for system-wide Mac volume adjusting as far as I know.\nNB: The only so-so way I've found is if audio is playing from Mac iTunes, and the iPhone/Watch is paired with that library via Home Sharing. The volume can then be changed with the Watch Remote app – but that doesn't trigger system-wide volume. It only changes iTunes' in-app volume.\nIs there some third-party software for iOS/WatchOS that can accomplish this?\nNote about iPhones: I know that the iOS app BTT Remote can control a Mac's volume, but unfortunately there is no Watch app for it.\n\nA: I've used MacID with great success on my Pebble smartwatch but they also have support for Apple Watch. It's $4 but TOTALLY worth it!\nhttps://macid.co/\nThe watch app requires the companion iPhone app to sync with the desktop app and control the volume and track selection. \nAnd that's not all, the iPhone to Mac has a proximity sensor so you can set your computer to unlock AS YOU APPROACH IT and lock if you get up to walk away. \nI hope this answer helps :) \n\nA: I use https://cherpake.com/remote-for-mac/ Runs on the Mac, with companion apps on the iPhone and Watch. It's honestly not great, but it can do this.\nOnce you've set it up, changing the volume consists of launching the app on the Watch, selecting the computer (yes, it makes you choose it even if you only have one), selecting \"KeyPad\", selecting \"Volume\", then tapping volume buttons on the display. Turning the crown does nothing.\nSo it's not exactly super convenient.\nThe app also has rather annoying screens if you don't pay to unlock it.\n\nA: Another alternative that I've tried lately is Homebridge with the homebridge-pc-volume plugin. \"pc\" here includes Macs.\nThis exposes the computer volume in Siri and in Home.app. You can presumably even make automations involving it.\nI've tried it out lately as a replacement for Remote for Mac (see other answer). It works pretty well.\nMy main annoyance is that it can hard to find this specific \"device\" in the Home.app on my watch, with many devices.\n", "Q: How to use MacOS Notes \"Note List Search...\" to search non-deleted notes only? I use \"Note List Search...\" and it's great. However, it searches through deleted notes as well and I sometimes I get confused. Is there a way to search only non-deleted notes?\nThis applies both to MacOS and iOS.\nWhich of these is possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable indexing of deleted notes somehow.\n\n*Make notes disappear on delete instead of going to Deleted folder. \n\n*Have one command for searching through non-deleted notes and another for searching all notes (including deleted).\n\n*Clearly mark deleted notes from non-deleted in the results (with different colors perhaps).\n\n\nA: It is not currently possible to search only undeleted notes without either emptying the Recently Deleted folder, or without locking all the notes you've deleted.\nRecently Deleted folder\nDeleted notes are placed in the Recently Deleted folder and, by default they will remain there for 30 days before they are automatically deleted. This applies to both macOS and iOS. So, if you manually delete them from there it will solve the problem, as they don't still exist to be searched.\nHowever, if you don't want empty the Recently Deleted folder, another option is locking your notes.\nLocking notes\nBy locking notes you will prevent them from being searchable. However, while the contents of these notes do not appear in search results, the titles of these notes will.\nYou can lock any notes so long as they're not already in the Recently Deleted folder. So one option would be to lock your notes prior to deleting them. \nTo lock notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the individual note you want to lock (you cannot lock more than one at a time)\n\n*Click on the padlock icon in the toolbar\n\n*Select the Lock This Note option\n\n*Enter your password (Note: If you've never used this feature before you will need to create a password. Once this is set, this will be the password you use to lock/unlock all notes in future.)\n\n*You will now see a padlock icon next to the title of your note. Initially it will be unlocked.\n\n*You can now lock the selected note by either clicking on the padlock icon in the toolbar or opening the note and clicking on the padlock icon in the notes toolbar.\n\n\nOnce locked, the contents of the note is unsearchable (although the title itself is still searched). This will be the case whether you now delete the note or not.\nBelow is more general info about searching notes.\nWithin macOS\nIn the Notes Help pages there's a page titled Search for notes.\nFrom this page, is the following info:\n\nYou can search for specific text in all your notes, notes in a specific account, or in a single note. Your search finds matching text in the body of notes and in the file names of attachments. Your search also finds matching text in text files (such as Pages documents and PDFs) that you’ve attached to your notes. If you’ve locked a note, only the title text appears in the results.\n\nAlso included are these tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search: Enter text in the search field.\n\n*Search in a specific account: Click a folder in the account you want\nto search, click in the search field, click the magnifying glass ,\nthen choose Current Account.\n\n*Search in all accounts: Click in the search field, click the\nmagnifying glass , then choose All Accounts.\n\n*Find text in a note: Click the body of a note to add an insertion\npoint, then choose Edit > Find > Find (or press Command-F). Enter text in the search field that appears.\n\n\nIf you're using macOS Sierra, you can also use Siri to search your notes.\nAsk Siri something like: “Show me notes from today”, or “Show me notes about vacation plans”.\nSource: Notes > Help > Notes Help and select the Search for notes page.\nWithin iOS\nAssuming you're using iOS 10, its Note app introduced some major enhancements.\nFrom the Use Notes on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch page on Apple's website:\n\nSearch for a note or attachment\nLooking for that note you made last week, last month, or even last\n  year? You can search for a specific note from the top of the Notes\n  list. Scroll to the top of the Notes list to reveal the search field,\n  then enter what you’re looking for. You can also search for\n  attachments. Tap Attachments Browser icon in the lower-left corner to\n  see sketches, photos, links, documents, and other attachments that\n  you’ve added to your notes. To go to the note with the attachment,\n  touch and hold the thumbnail of the attachment, then tap Show in Note.\n\nAnd of course, you can use Siri (as I mentioned above) to search notes in iOS.\n", "Q: Apple ID Switch/Split Here is some background knowledge... \nMy Apple ID is also used by my brother. This originated back when the iPhones came out and it was necessary to plug them into a computer to start in order to house the music, apps, etc, that existed on my laptop. However, I no longer utilize this laptop or any other ones. \nSince we share an Apple ID we receive phone calls, texts, and voicemails for the other person EVEN THOUGH we've both gone into our settings and opted to receive only our own via our respective phone numbers and emails. \nI've recently received my upgraded phone.  I feel like now is the perfect time to split into two Apple IDs. \nMy question:  How do I do this without losing all of my information? I use the iCloud extra storage for $.99 per month so all of my data is backed up, but i can't view it due to my lack of laptop (no need for one- until now).  What I am most concerned about is I want to retrieve my data from my current Apple ID and place it on my new one, while also being careful to not transfer his shared device to my new phone, which would result in the same issue as before.  Can I do this using iCloud without plugging into a computer?\nI hope this rambling makes sense..  Also, I really do like my brother, I'm just tired of having double the contacts and messages, and a constantly full voicemail box.. I think you get the point. \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: An operation may be needed to separate the 'siamese' twins ;-)\nIt is not going to be totally painless. \nStart by investigating Family Sharing - which will enable you to keep the apps/music/books etc you have purchased.\nFamily sharing also necessitates designating one of the accounts as 'payer', so you may still have to negotiate who pays who for what, going forwards.\nHowever, any data within each app, including anything like game progress, web & other history, contacts etc is going to end up belonging solely to one brother. The other is going to have to start from scratch.\nContacts can be downloaded as .vcf files from the iCloud web page.\nCalendars can be shared between family members.\n...but I think just about everything else is going to be starting over from scratch.\n", "Q: How to Convert a Webex ARF File on OSX (a Mac) My company is in the habit of adopting Windows-centric solutions.  The latest is Webex for hosting and recording meetings.  Webex records the meeting and makes the file available for download in the form of their proprietary ARF format. Predictably, their own player supports converting to MP4 only in the Windows version of the player, and not in the Mac version of the player.  So the question I have for this community is:\nHow do I convert an ARF file to an MP4 using a Mac?\nUpdate:  Things I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications:\n\n\n-- IdealShare VideoGo claims to convert ARF files on a Mac but this is not true. I downloaded their free trial and was told that ARF is not a valid media type.\n-- Aiseesoft will come up in google searches as an option but their software is also PC only for purposes of converting ARF.\n\n\n*nbr2mp4 does not work on a Mac. You will get an error about not being able to open a display.\n\n\nA: Webex has a Mac version of their player on their player website available for download:  \nhttps://welcome.webex.com/client/T31L/mac/intel/webexnbrplayer_intel.dmg\nThe software will install, but (IMO) it doesn't create an application link in Finder or in Launch Pad.  I personally don't have any WebEx recordings I can use to test, but you can launch the player manually.  It's located in the user's library folder under:\n~/Library/Application Support/WebEx Folder/500\n\nI was able to launch the player by using Terminal and typing:\n$ open ~/Library/Application Support/WebEx Folder/500/Network\\ Recording\\ Player.app\n\nYou could also open that folder in Finder and create an alias to put on your Desktop/Applications folder.\n\nConvert the Audio\nThe kicker here is your are going to need another app to \"grab\" the audio.  You can use Audio Hijack or Soundflower.  You can also do it via hardware (less than $30) which will also give you a high quality USB audio interface that you can use for other purposes (I personally use this method for my iMac interface to my Bose Wave Radio).\n", "Q: How to disable Apple Wireless Trackpad from recovery mode? I booted into recovery mode / macOS Utilities and erased my hard drive anticipating to reinstall the OS. Unfortunately my computer is paired to an Apple Wireless Trackpad that I can't find. I believe this trackpad's button is permanently pressed, preventing me from left-clicking, so I can't get all the way through the installer. This trackpad is listed as paired and connected when I go into Terminal and run system_profiler. However recovery mode has no System Preferences so I don't know how to disable this trackpad. Is there any way I can disable the trackpad from recovery mode, such as from Terminal?\n\nA: Try moving the computer to another location a good distance away from where the trackpad may be located. The theoretical maximum distance for Bluetooth is actually far larger than what I thought. See this page, and this one for more info about Bluetooth ranges.\n", "Q: Does \"Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi\" use encryption? I would like to sync my iPhone to iTunes over Wi-Fi but only if the process is encrypted for privacy.  I'm still feeling a lack of trust after learning that MobileMe synced personal data across the Internet unprotected.  Is the sync encrypted?\n\nA: iTunes Wi-Fi Sync does not use encryption as it is performed on your local network only.\nYour data is not transferred over the internet, so it's as secure as your local network is.\n(The link about MobileMe is extremely old; Yahoo! Mail and Windows Live didn't use HTTPS.)\n\nA: It's entirely up to you whether or not it's encrypted. It uses your local wifi network, which you can configure however you want. If you configure it to be encrypted, by setting up WPA2, then it's encrypted. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2016 Left Click lag in games? I've recently purchased a 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro w/ Touch Bar and I've noticed something incredibly strange when playing games. Left-clicking with any pointer (either the trackpad or mouse) results in a noticeable delay in a game's response. So far, I've noticed it while playing League of Legends, Borderlands 2, and Mark of the Ninja. \nIn the case of League, left clicking doesn't cause the game to freeze up, but rather the game does not register the left click unless the click is held down for a longer time. This is true for both a mouse and the trackpad.\nFor BL2, left clicking anywhere, either in the menus or in the 3D environment , will result in a slight delay before the click is registered, but will then visually lock up cursor movement. Objects in the 3D environment still move at full FPS, but the player First Person camera will briefly freeze, then cut to where it WOULD be if the freeze never occurred. In this way, left-clicking doesn't freeze the game per say, but rather freezes movement of the game camera briefly.\nMark of the Ninja has an issue similar to League, where left clicking is not registered unless the click is held down. \nFrom these three scenarios, I am led to believe that the issue does not lie exclusively with the trackpad or mouse (since the problem occurs with both input mechanisms). I also believe that the problem exists outside of Steam (which was used to play both BL2 and MotN) since LoL was affected. I have tried adjusting double-click speed in Trackpad and Mouse settings, which did not help. I also tried turning off Force-Click and Three-Finger Drag for the trackpad, which also did not help.\nThe problem seems only to occur in games; navigating around the Desktop and Finder is speedy and responsive.\nHas anyone else had this issue and/or knows how to fix it? I am running MacOS Sierra 10.12.5.\n\nA: I found the solution after a long time searching....\nAs it turns out, a third party app called \"Magnet\" was causing the delay. Many other games have had similar issues due to this app running in the background.\n\nA: What is your FPS during the game? Most games only check for new input each time a new frame is rendered. Thus less frames = less input checks. The fact that you don't get this problem while doing normal tasks supports this hypothesis since navigating around the desktop is easier on your GPU than gaming. That is to say you get higher FPS on the desktop and therefore more input checks.  \nAlso see this similar question.\n", "Q: No longer update apps or use safari I recently migrated my macbook 12\" to a macbook pro (touchbar). I used the migration assistant to transfer a backup from the old mac to the new one. At first all was successful apart from a slight issue with the incompatible OS version between the two machines. (I had to update before migrating)\nI am running Sierra(10.12.5 (16F73)) on the new machine. I am now facing a number of issues with the machine, I would guess its a permission thing. I think but cannot be certain that vmware fusion has something to do with the issue because it was the last program I tried to install from the old backup before seeing issues. (I had to kill the installation)\n\n\n*\n\n*safari opens and appears to load a page, but just sits there - no matter what the url is. Chrome and Firefox work perfectly well and other programs do not have an issue getting an internet connection. \n\n*mac store updates do not work, when I click update on an app, I see: \"We could not complete your update.

It lasts about 2-3 minutes each time and then disappears.\nI am running Yosemite 10.10.5 on an early 2011 MBP. I shut down every night and reboot in the morning.\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have done all of the updates available in the App Store.\n\n*I have unchecked every box in the App Store settings regarding checking for updates (in fact, I have just unchecked every box).\n\n*I have disabled check for updates in iTunes settings.\n\n*I have force-quit softwareupdated in Activity Monitor. It comes back straight away to finish whatever mystery task it is performing.\n\n\nHaving looked at similar questions, this problem seems unusual. Most report that softwareupdated runs constantly at high CPU, instead of coming and going. The recommended trick to deal with this is to reboot, however that does nothing for my problem.\nI am not computer literate enough to know how to determine precisely what app is launching this (or even if it is an app launching it). The only things I generally have running are Terminal, MATLAB 2016b, Safari, and iTunes. Sometimes Mail.\nIt's driving me mad; I am sure it can't be good for it to suddenly get so hot, so regularly. Moreover, I am worried that the only way to get it to stop is to upgrade to Sierra, but my MBP is pretty old and I am concerned about slow-down. \nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I find out why it is running?\n\n*Are there any other apps, like iTunes, that have independent update checking?\n\n*Is it possible that my settings regarding checking for updates are being overridden? \n\n\nEDIT: I should perhaps say, this has been an ongoing problem for quite some time now. It is not something that has suddenly started - I am just using my Mac more than usual at the moment, and hence it is now becoming a real problem.\n\nA: Answering my own question - after an extremely laborious process of elimination,  I discovered that the application causing softwareupdated to run so frequently was my VPN agent (GlobalProtect), which I use to connect to my university network when working from home.\nGlobalProtect will initiate softwareupdated every time it connects, and periodically whilst connected. There is no option to disable this feature as an end user, even when using the most up-to-date version.\nI have uninstalled GlobalProtect and switched to using Tunnelblick, which is also approved for use with my university. So far, so good!\n\nA: Hmm.  Try opening up terminal, and at the prompt, enter the command:\n\n$ softwareupdate -l && sudo softwareupdate -i -a\n\nThat will tell the system to show you which updates need to be done, then run software update and install all of the updates it found.  See if it gives you any error messages; it may ask you to reboot right away, in which case do that.  Run the same command again after the reboot and see if it still finds updates to install or if nothing shows up.  If nothing shows up then it completed all the updates, and the problem hopefully goes away.  If not, let us know.\n", "Q: Remove downloads or remove from library for duplicate playlist? I have a playlist that I sync between iTunes and my iPhone on iOS 10.3.1. Sometimes I see that a playlist gets duplicated with the number 1 after the name. I want to delete the duplicated playlist from my iPhone, but I get a concerning dialog, asking if I want to remove downloads ore remove the playlist from the library.\nI'm not quite sure what it's asking. Can someone explain this? Any downloaded songs from iTunes I want to stay on the phone as part of the original playlist and in general, but I want that second playlist itself to disappear.\n\n\nA: Remove Downloads will leave the playlist in your library, but remove the music files associated with the songs in that playlist from your phone, thus freeing up storage. It's a quick method to bulk-remove songs from your phone.\nDelete from Library will remove the playlist itself from your media library (including iCloud Music Library if you use iTunes Match or MUSIC). However whatever music files you've already downloaded will remain on your phone.\nIn your case, you should Delete from Library if you are certain the playlist is a duplicate.\n", "Q: Vim mappings not working in OS X I have the following lines in my .vimrc for Ubuntu.

Some time ago I pressed a weird key combination that seemed to add a margin to the top and bottom of active application window (in this case, iTerm2). See screenshot below:\n\nIt doesn't happen on any other apps. Just this one, so it is like the OS or Window manager has remembered this setting for this specific app.\nI have no idea what the key combination was or how to remove this margin. It's very infuriating.\nI use Spectacle to resize/re-position windows so I suspected it may be related to this app but it has no mention of being able to create window margins.\nAny ideas? Perhaps someone knows where the OS stores application-specific window properties?\n\nA: I eventually figured this out and the cause is specific to iTerm2 rather than MacOS.\nThere is an advanced setting in iTerm2 called \"Terminal Windows Resize Smoothly\" which when set to \"No\" forces the terminal window size to snap to the current font grid. This is what caused the margin and prevented me from resizing to remove the margin. Setting this to \"Yes\" or holding CTRL when resizing the iTerm2 window allows the window to resize to any size rather than snap to grid.\nHooray!\n\n", "Q: Archive mails in Apple Mail plus Office 365 setup I am using my company mailbox since 2011.

I want to use a Mac Pro on the display of a MacBook. That's because I mainly use MacBook and now would like to use Mac Pro only when I need more power.\nBut since I'm a traveler for all year round, there is no choice to use iMac or MacBook Pro.\nSo is it possible to use the display, keyboard, and trackpad of a MacBook to use Mac Pro? \n\nA: You can use some computers that have a Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt port as an external display.\nYou can view the contents of your Mac on the display of another Mac using Target Display Mode, a feature in OS X. Target Display Mode lets you use a Mac as the external display for another “primary” Mac. In some cases, you can also use Target Display Mode to play the sound from your primary Mac on the speakers of the external Mac. For example, a MacBook Pro could use a 27-inch iMac as the display and play its audio on the iMac as well.\nAfter connecting the computers and turning on Target Display Mode, the external display Mac acts like any other external display. Apps that were open on the external display Mac remain open even though you can’t see their windows.\nDisplay the contents of your Mac on an iMac with Thunderbolt\nIf you have an iMac with Thunderbolt, any other Mac with Thunderbolt can use it as a display.

Make sure you have a Mini DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable.\nIf the primary Mac has a Thunderbolt port, it can play its audio and video on the iMac. If the primary Mac has a Mini DisplayPort, the iMac may be able to play its audio. To see if it can, go to the primary Mac, choose Apple menu > About This Mac, click System Report, then select Audio in the Hardware category. A list of your computer’s audio devices appears. If HDMI Output or HDMI/DisplayPort output is listed, your computer’s Mini DisplayPort can send audio.

I'm shopping around for a pre-loved Mac Pro with dual 6-core \"Westmere\" processors. Finding a decently priced 2010 base model is a lot harder than finding a 2009 with upgraded processors.\nIn talking to Mac Pro refurbishers, some tell me that one should not upgrade a 2009 Mac Pro with the 6-core \"Westmore\" processors for reasons of it not being as stable as the 2010 Mac Pro 6-core machine. Some tell me that it will cause the fan to run all the time. Others say there's no problem at all upgrading a 2009 Mac Pro with dual 6-core \"Westmere\" processors.\nMy question is, are there any inherent problems or disadvantages to upgrading a 2009 Mac Pro with dual 6-core \"Westmere\" processors vs starting with a 2010 Mac Pro and doing the same? The later is harder to come by and thus more expensive.\n\nA: Too long to be a comment, yet not conclusive enough to be an answer - but I'd like to throw in a couple of my experiences, even if I have no comparison.\nI've never had a 'real' 5,1 but I do have a 3.46GHz Westmere upgraded 4,1.\nTo all intents & purposes everything except the front page of About this Mac considers it a 5,1.\n  \nI've always noticed a temperature discrepancy between the two processors - ref Mac Pro CPU temperature discrepancy - [which reached no solid conclusion] though it's never seemed to cause any problems, it just bothers my inner geek a bit.\nI think the CPU fans always run a little fast, though again not enough to cause issues & it can be compensated by running the intake fans a little faster.\nIntake at default 600\n \nIntake at 800\n \nIntake at 1000\n \nI also had an issue with the Security update last year - Security update 2016-003 10.11.6 issues - [which again has no actual answer] I have no idea if it's related, but I ended up not having the update installed.\nI have yet to dare attempt the recent 2017 security update.

There is a bunch of signaling conversion that goes on with an adapter, especially when it goes from digital (HDMI) to analog (VGA).  An active adapter will reformat the signals so it's a true VGA signal rather than just supply the correct pin outs.\nTake a look at this answer, Passive vs. Active adapters - I talk about the difference and why it's important.\n", "Q: What is the difference between the \"Local Network\" and \"Local Network and VPN\" options in Server I'm trying to understand what the difference is between these three options, and more to the point, I'm trying to determine which one is right for me.\n\nI'm aware that there is a difference in hostnames (.local vs .private), but I don't know what the implications of that are. Are there any other differences?\nMy Use case:\nI have a Mac that I use as a server for Time Machine backups, file sharing, printer sharing, screen sharing, etc, but it is not a VPN server. I typically access this server over the LAN. I have a separate OpenVPN server running on my router, to which I can successfully connect. I would like to have this server accessible over LAN, over my VPN connection to my router.\n\"Local Network and VPN\" would be my first choice, but I don't know if it pertains to any VPN connections, or those connected to specifically this Mac.\nTL; DR:\nWhat is the difference between these options, and which one is right for me?\n\nA: .local vs .private doesn't really matter, they're just different names.. the implications of .local vs .private just have to do with how DNS zones are created.  You'll be more interested in the security implications, because my belief is that LAN-only restricts services access to the local, private network; LAN + VPN opens it up to not just the local LAN but also the VPN connection/network (they're considered separate networks, remember,) and 'Internet' opens services up to the WAN.  If I were you I'd actually stick with LAN because as far as your server is concerned, once you're connected in to the LAN through OpenVPN, it doesn't care whether you're in the same room or not, nor can it tell.\nLAN + VPN wouldn't screw you up but would set up Server.app with firewall and service rules allowing for the VPN service and its related networks to also access the services running on the server.\nHope that answers your question.\n", "Q: Put second display to sleep I just got a second display for my iMac and am wondering if there is a way to put the second one to sleep without putting both displays to sleep.

When I check on iTunes I can see the music is on my iPhone, but when I search for these songs on my iPhone I can't find them. \nWhat do I have to do to make this album visible?\n\nA: One thing you could check is whether Resrictions are enabled on your iPhone.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone tap on Settings\n\n*Swipe up and tap on General\n\n*Look for the Restrictions option and check to the right of it to see if they are Off or On.\n\n*If Restrictions are Off, then it won't be a restrictions issue and you can skip the rest of these steps.\n\n*If Restrictions are On, and you know the restrictions passcode, then tap on Restrictions and enter the passcode.\n\n*Once the Restrictions list appears, swipe up until you see the Allowed Content list\n\n*The second item on the list includes your Music restrictions.

I have set ⌥ + M to execute the command \"Paste and Match Style\", system-wide. I assigned this custom shortcut at the following location:\nSystem Preferences → Keyboard → App Shortcuts → All Applications\nHowever, instead of the desired effect of pasting and matching style, pressing ⌥ + M on my keyboard usually types the character µ instead. Only every so often does my shortcut randomly function correctly.\nHow can I disable the assignment of this special character to my shortcut, so that the shortcut is dedicated to my user-defined command? I never have the need to type this Mu character, so I have no problem with ridding it from my keyboard entirely.\nI understand that one can use a re-mapping program (such as Karabiner.app) as a workaround to accomplish this. But, does Apple offer a built-in way to remove special character shortcuts?\n\nA: As a workaround, since I know you use FastScripts, here's a suggestion.\nUndo the changes you made in System Preferences > Keyboard > Application Shortcuts > All Applications, by first changing ⌥M back to ⌥⇧⌘V, then delete the Paste and Match Style command you added. Note that you could probably just delete it without first reseting it to its default key sequence, however I do it this way to insure it gets reset properly.\nWith things back to normal, create an AppleScript .scpt using the code below, saving it as Paste and Match Style.scpt in the Users Script Folder (~/Library/Scripts).\ntell application \"System Events\" to key code 9 using {option down, shift down, command down}\n\nNote that you can also use keystroke \"v\" in place of key code 9, I just prefer to use key code over keystroke most of the time.\nIn FastScripts > Preferences... > Script Shortcuts, assign ⌥M to: Paste and Match Style\nNow you will not get the µ character when pressing ⌥M when FastScripts is running.\n\nA: Apple always uses Option/alt for special characters. Just use Control or Command for the functions you want instead.  \n", "Q: Office Excel 2016 update not applying. My current Excel version is 15.26.0.

However the update software does another check and indicates this update is still needed (as if it was not done). A laptop restart and check confirms that the Excel version is still 15.26.0. \nAny thoughts on why the update is not sticking. \n\nA: Cause was my previous renaming of the Excel application in the application folder. \nIn the application folder I had previously added the suffice 2016 to the name of the Excel program to delineate it from the older version (kept in event of compatibility issues with old files) from the 2011 suite. \nThe download process added the update application separately with its original name \"Microsoft Excel.app\"  Deleting the old version, adding the prefix 2016 (as is my preference) to the new Excel file.

It's great for that. But also has a microphone that sucks. \nMy iPhone 7 automatically pairs with the device when I get in the car so I can listen to music. But when I go to Siri (by holding the home button down -- I don't use Hey, Siri) it is routed through that crappy microphone and therefore never understands what I'm saying. \nI finally figured out that I can enact Siri, then click on the little button on the lower right (in the 'Siri View') and be given a choice of what microphone to use. I can go back to internal and all is right with the world. But... then next time I get back in my car it's all reset over to the crappy microphone again and I have to go through the process to get it back to internal. \nThis is crappy.

How do I ALWAYS keep Siri coming through my device's microphone instead of constantly resetting back to an external Bluetooth one?\nMuch obliged to whoever has figured this out and willing to share:)\n\nA: This is an often-asked question on many sites.  Unfortunately, all those sites say the same thing: this isn't possible.\nAs long as you're connected to a Bluetooth device that has a microphone, the iPhone will use that mic for Siri unless you specifically change it (like you mentioned) each time you use it.  I think your best option is use a Bluetooth device that doesn't have a mic.  No mic, no problem.\nI don't know if this is part of the Bluetooth specifications and can't be changed or if it's an Apple-controlled thing.

Pre-deployment and shortly after deployment, the end users were able to administer the Macs without issue.  They could escalate processes with their credentials.\nSince then, none of the Macs recognize our users as administrators anymore, myself included (I'm in a separate AD group membership that was added at the same time).  We then started going into each user profile and checking the \"Allow user to administer this computer\" checkbox, which again worked for a time but no longer does.\nWe have started falling back on the local administrator user account to manually authenticate when needed, but we're not able to share that password with end users.\nThe following link is what I used for reference:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202112\nIs there something we're missing?  Why would the administrative behavior work for a time then just stop?\nEdit: This is not a duplicate to AD User as an administrator on the Mac?.

The key issue is that I do actually get local administrator privileges for a short period, but then for some unexplained reason, all users but administrator lose their privileges and no longer escalate privileges.  \n\nA: This sort of pain isn't practically avoidable. The solution is to unbind your macOS computers from the domain and use a product like Nomad or Apple Enterprise Connect to get the password sync, kerberos certificates that allow single sign on without all the pain of binding.\n\n\n*\n\n*Jamf Connect is the best of both worlds now - https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-connect/\nAlternatives are the open source Nomad (which exists alongside with it's commercial version Jamf Connect) and Enterprise Connect that integrates a local password without needing to bind to AD.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/17757/about-enterprise-connect\n\n*https://nomad.menu\n", "Q: Cannot get duplication of screens to work with mini display between iMac & Macbook Have an iMac 21\", 2.5, Mid 2011 and a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 and I just bought a Mini display to connect them through the Thunderbolt.

Command F2 doesn't work. \nAny idea whats wrong? how can I get the option to have them connected, not for data, just sound and image?\n\nA: The problem is that you need to use a Thunderbolt Cable to use your iMac in Target Display Mode.  From Apple's website:\n\nFrom your original question, you mention that you purchased a \"mini display\" which I can only deduce is that you meant that you bought a \"mini Display Port cable.\"  If this is in fact the case, it's the wrong cable; which is why it's not working.\n", "Q: Siri saved my reminder on the shared \"family\" list. How can I prevent this from happening again? I asked Siri to remind me to purchase some personal items at the pharmacy, and right at that time the reminder appeared, I got an awkward phone call from a family member asking me why my reminders appeared on their phone.\nI discovered this when I opened \"reminders\" on the Mac. Somehow the only reminder list I have is \"Family\". That means every alert I had appeared on their devices.   every.one.\nBesides being exposed to a complete lack of privacy, how can I stop default reminders, of any source, from appearing on the family iCloud group?\nExamples: Email, calendar, events, etc\n\nA: Settings → Reminders → Default List. This is where you can choose the list you wish to store reminders when you don't specify a location at the time of creating the reminder.\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Remind me to …\" uses the list you select as the Default List in Settings.\n\n*\"Add … to my … list\" uses the list mentioned in that specific Siri command.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to consolidate music bought from iTunes Stores in different countries in a single device? My main account is on the Canadian iTunes Store but I would like to buy albums that are only available on the Japanese and UK iTunes and have everything together on an iPad. Is it possible to switch stores on the Windows iTunes app, buy these albums, and then transfer them over to the iPad? Or even better, would I be able to download these albums from my account on the iPad directly? Regardless of which country's store they were bought from originally?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible, but it may not be entirely convenient (only you can judge how convenient it is for you).\nIn summary, the process involves:\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing the iTunes Store in your Windows iTunes app to the Japanese store\n\n*Registering for a Japanese iTunes Store account (you cannot use the same one you use in Canada)\n\n*Purchasing the music you want from the Japanese iTunes Store\n\n*Syncing this music to your iPad\n\n\nNotes: \n1 You will need to repeat the above process for the UK iTunes Store.\n2 The process of creating accounts in the other stores is not too hard, but you will need to follow specific steps if you don't have credit cards issued in Japan and the UK.\n3 Assuming you want to purchase music that isn't free, you will need a way to do so in the correct currency (either with credit cards issued in Japan or the UK, or by redeeming iTunes gift cards that are sold in their respective countries).\nIn summary\nYou cannot use a credit card and/or iTunes gift card you obtained in Canada for the Japanese or UK iTunes Stores. Also, you will need to switch between stores to browse/purchase content. Finally, when syncing the music to a device you will be prompted to enter the ID and password of the account used to purchase the items you're syncing.\nSo, as stated above, it is possible, but only you can personally decide whether it is too inconvenient for you.\n", "Q: Unlinking a work laptop from my personal Apple devices I own an iPad and an iPhone. I also have a work MacBook Air laptop which I will be returning to the owners soon. How do I stop this device linking to my personal iPad and iPhone?\n\nA: Your best bet would be to follow these steps on the MacBook Air:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup any data you may want to keep (including data on iCloud)\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*From the menu bar go to Account > Authorizations > Deauthorize This Computer\n\n*Enter your Apple ID and password\n\n*Click Deauthorise\n\n*Now also go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on the iCloud preference pane\n\n*If it's selected, then deselect the Find My Mac checkbox\n\n*Now totally sign out of iCloud\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n*Launch the Messages app\n\n*Go to Messages > Preferences > Accounts\n\n*Select the Accounts tab\n\n*Sign out of any personal accounts\n\n*Follow these steps to reinstall macOS\n\n\nNow you're MacBook Air is ready to hand back.\nOPTIONAL: If you can't do Step 15 (e.g. you're not allowed to, etc) then you could also do the following (assuming you're allowed to):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Click on the + sign to add a new account. When you do, ensure that it is an Administrator account.\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n*Restart the Mac and login to the new user account you just created\n\n*Once you're logged in, go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Click on the - button to delete your original account.

As as result, I cannot install updates. How can I find what is preventing the Mac from restarting?  \nIf I have to restart to clear out the RAM or similar, what I have been doing is running the terminal command sudo reboot now but I cannot install updates this way. Thank you.  \n\nA: Upgrading the OS to High Sierra resolved this issue.\n", "Q: Is migrating using a Time Machine backup the same as using the old Mac in target disk mode? If I migrate to a new Mac using Migration Assistant, when it prompts about connecting a source disk, is using a fresh Time Machine backup equivalent to using my old Mac in target disk mode?\n\nA: Yes and no. Let me explain.\nYes if you do it manually in the sense you're just copying the data manually from your Time Machine backup.\nNo if you do it via the installation process or if you do it afterwards using the Migration Assistant app (usually found in your Utilities folder). It's also a 'No' if you use the restore options built into Time Machine itself.\nOne of the advantages of migrating from a Time Machine backup is that you can easily migrate your applications etc instead of having to reinstall them again. Another great advantage is that some of your hidden data gets transferred across - so you're not having to manually delve deeply to find things such as your email data.\nRegardless of how you choose to migrate your data, once you're done I would strongly recommend you use Time Machine as part of your backup regime.\nFor more information you can refer to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move your content to a new Mac\n\n*Use Time Machine to back up or restore your Mac\n[EDIT]\nIf you're intending to use Migration Assistant and selecting between transferring your data from a TM backup or from your old Mac, then it's effectively the same thing in terms of what Migration Assistant is doing. The only difference is the source it's connected to, but since the TM backup is a backup of the old Mac, the data being transferred is the same.\n", "Q: Quickly send pre-written response on Mac mail? I get a lot of emails from recruiters sending irrelevant jobs to me, so I have a standard response that I copy and paste into replies. At the moment I do this manually from a saved text file. Is there a quicker way of doing this? \nI was imagining there would be some way to save a reply so 1 button or shortcut would send this reply. \n\nA: Quickly insert a standard response on macOS\nPrepare your response\n\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit.\n\n*Create new empty document (CMD+N).\n\n*Type your desired response.\n\n*Select the text (CMD+A) and copy it to your clipboard (CMD+C).\n\n*Confirm by pressing return.\n\n\n\nTeach macOS your response\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Go to Keyboard > Text\n\n*Press the + button and enter a unique shorthand (e. g. rresponse1). It will be replaced by your standard response. \n\n*Press Tab to go to the next field and paste your response from your clipboard (CMD+V).\n\n\n\n\nUse your response\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your desired macOS application and click inside a text field.\n\n*Type your shorthand (rresponse1) and a space character.\n\n*macOS will expand the text for you automatically.\n\n\nDoes this answer your question?\n\n", "Q: Right place for .so files I'm compiling a few modules for apache where is the best place to put them on OSX systems? It seems that root user doesn't have permissions to write on /usr/local.\n\nA: I never understood why \"shared\" libraries that are exclusive for one application should mess up a system folder. I would create a modules folder inside apache, add it to the dyld path and run update_dyld_shared_cache. When I want to remove the software one day, I just delete the folder in one place.\n", "Q: Backed up videos won't play on the iPad they were backed up from I was at a point where my iPad was full on storage due to huge amount of photos and documents. It was iOS 8.3 at the time. I decided to back it up and update it to iOS 10. I connected it to my PC, backed it up and updated it. It then gave me the option to restore from the back up so I did. I activated my iPad and started using it. Everything is fine, it is faster and smoother however when I try to play videos from backed up photo album, white loading circle starts turning and does not stop.

I am wanting to re-format and start anew with my time machine backup, but I am unsure if restoring a folder restores all copies of files across backups, or only copies found in the most recent backup. Ex: If I have files AB in backup 1, files ABC in backup 2, and files BC in the most recent backup, when I use the \"restore to...\" function and restore a backup folder to my user folder, does it restore ABC? I've browsed Pondini's webpage and several posts here and elsewhere, and haven't seen this specifically addressed. I'm not so much worried about different versions of a given file, but am seeking a \"flattened\" restoration of files that have been since deleted along with more recent files, all of which should be present in various backups but that are not all present in any one given backup. \nThanks! \n\nA: Doing a full restore from Time Machine will restore exactly one snapshot (usually the most recent one), without any files/folders only available in other/older versions. Which actually kind of makes sense if you consider that TM also backups OS files etc where you don't what to have a flattening effect with files from previous versions.\nYou can recover files only available in older snapshots through the Time Machine interface from Finder though.\n", "Q: imac: keyboard stuck on caps lock From time to time the (Apple USB) keyboard of my imac (21.5-inch, Mid 2010, mac os 10.12.5) gets stuck on caps lock (namely all letters are printed capital, and I can't turn capital off), and I have to unplug the USB cable to fix this; when I plug it back, the light is on, and I can turn caps lock off.

Is it possible to add a comment or note to the Health app? I could see this ability as a useful way to interpret or supplement the data. \nFor example, if I'm sick for a few days, it could explain a change in my diet or weight. (\"Today was Day 3 of flu symptoms, but I'm feeling better than yesterday.\") Or, if I'm on a medication, I might want to make notes of any observations. (\"I forgot to take my X pill last night; today, I have a headache.\")\n\nA: Adding notes in Health.app\nNo, as of iOS 10.3.x you can't add comments to Health.app and its database.\n\nAlternative (3rd party apps)\nIf you want to enter any notes or observations you need to rely on a third party app to do so.\nIdeally, this app should be able to export your notes in a non-proprietary format like XML. Not all apps (e.g. Pillow) with a notes feature allow you to do that. (Thanks @Mark)\n\nAlternative (use unused fields)\nYou may use unused Health.app fields to store your observations.

I found Geekbench 4 in my AppStore, but it makes no mention of any battery benchmarks in its description. \nHow do I go about doing a battery benchmark?\nUpdate\nWell my 3rd party battery died completely before I could do the experiment. Conclusion: It was garbage that somehow kept a decent charge until its failure. \n\nA: Geekbench\nI don't have Geekbench 4, but according to this Primate Labs support page (1 Feb 2017):\n\nWe're hoping to re-release a battery test for iOS in the future but as of right now we don't have an exact timeline of when that will be available.\n\nSo you would need to double-check with them prior to download whether the battery test has been re-released yet (although based on the screenshots I think not).\nIn terms of the test itself, I do have Geekbench 3 installed on my iPhone and it includes a Run Battery Benchmark function.  \nThis is a very lengthy battery test designed to totally discharge a fully charged battery (the app prompts you to plug it in and charge it to 100% before testing). That said, it is actually possible to run the test with only a partially charged battery. \nThe app also keeps a history of the benchmarks - so it'd be easy for you to keep a separate record of which battery was installed at the time of the benchmark.\nMy assumption is that when it is re-released, the same functions would be included.\ncoconutBattery\nIn case you haven't heard of coconutBattery, this is an awesome app that you can install on your Mac (if you have one). You can then connect your iPhone to your Mac and this app will show you the battery's current charge, its full charge capacity, and its design capacity (among other things). It also keeps a history, so it'd be easy for you to keep a separate record of which battery was installed at the time you connected your iPhone to your Mac.\nIf you have a MacBook of some sort it'll give you a whole heap of info relating to your MacBook battery too.\nOther iOS Battery apps\nThere are countless iOS battery apps available, most of which I think aren't worth the download. \nHowever, Battery Life is one of the best (make sure it's the one by Robert Tkotzyk - as there have been a couple of copies that essentially look exactly the same). I have found this app's Run Times to be more accurate than many others. By Run Times I mean it provides an estimate of the remaining runtime for various functions (e.g. talk time, browsing, video, etc).\nDo your own 'real life' testing\nDoing some real life testing provides the advantage of determining the exact battery life for your exact scenario (iPhone model, battery, installed apps, etc).\nFor one possible way you could do this, refer to my answer here. As you can see, it's quite involved if you want to ensure accuracy, and it will take some time.\nSummary\nMy recommendation would be to contact Primate Labs to seek the current status of again including a battery benchmark test on their iOS app. I think this will do exactly what you want without all the mucking around.\nBeyond that, I would try coconutBattery out (it's free to download) and give Battery Life a go too. \nNOTE: - I have no affiliation whatsoever with any of the products described in this answer.\n", "Q: Colouring text in a notification message created by AppleScript The followng AppleScript code shows a notification message with the texts Text A and Text B both in black.\ndisplay notification \"Test B\" with title \"Text A\"\n\nIs it possible to set their colour to, say red and blue each?\n\nA: Looking at the AppleScript Language Guide Command Reference for display notification, none of it's Parameters mention any color attributes for the text, and therefore I'd have to say the answer is no. \n", "Q: Why do iOS updates have \"Apple Inc\" in the top corner? I was notified of the iOS 10.3.2 update, and when I went to check it out, I saw “Apple Inc.” in the corner. What does this mean? Or can it be displayed by something else?\n\n\nA: This means that Apple issued an update for the version of iOS on your device.  It indicates that the owner of the software is 'Apple Inc'.\nApple officially changed their name from 'Apple Computer Inc' to 'Apple Inc' in January 2007.\nI'm not sure this is the answer you were looking for but it's the best I could do based on how your question is worded.  If the answer isn't what you wanted, please edit your question with additional info and I, and others here, will do our best to answer.\n\nA: The UI has been modelled to be similar to updates provided through the App Store.\nFor iOS updates, the company is always \"Apple Inc.\", as they are the only ones who deliver iOS updates to your device. It's shown because the UI is meant to be reflective of the UI when updating App Store apps, in which case the developer may not be Apple.\n", "Q: Does iOS 8 support AES in GCM mode to encrypt data in TLS/SSL?

This is ridiculous as I mainly use it as a charging hub.\nThere is nothing in the manual about this - and I can find nothing on Google.\nIs there any way to keep the USB hub powered all the time?\n\nA: This is expected behavior.  According the LG specifications the maximum power supplied when in sleep mode is 1.2W and when off is .5W. (This is for the monitor as a whole, not just the USB ports. For this answer, let's assume all of the power is being redirected to the ports - for illustrative purposes only)\nUsing the formula for watts and converting to solve for Amps,\nW = V * A  => A = W ÷ V\n\nSo, assuming that the 5V remains constant, the amps it's supplying is .24A in sleep and .1A off.  For the record, that's not enough to charge a Nokia 3310 from 2000 much less a smartphone from the last 10 years.  \nThe power requirement for USB 2.0 is to supply upto 500mA (.5A), 3A for USB 3.1 and up to 5A for power delivery (the type C interface).\nWhen you unplug your MacBook from the monitor, it goes into sleep mode and dropping power consumption which ultimately disconnects your devices.\nMy solution is to purchase an Anker USB charging hub that's designed for this type of task. I've purchased this exact charging hub and positioned it at the side of my desk to charge the myriad of devices.  Even when I need to connect my device to my Mac and charge simultaneously, I have a hub that's capable of delivering 10W on the port.\n\nA: It charge my devices nicely without a connected MacBook, if I am not using a USB-C to USB-C cable.

When should I be prompted for my passcode? I recently purchased an iPhone 6s. It's the first iPhone I’ve owned with a Touch ID scanner.\nAfter setting it up I’ve found it to be very accurate, fast and reliable. But sometimes I get prompted for my passcode instead of just being able to use my fingerprint. This appears to be random. It usually happens when I first use it in the morning, but not always!! And sometimes it happens at other times too.\nI read this question but I’ve already tried deleting and adding my fingerprints again, but I didn’t notice any improvement. \nIs my fingerprint Touch ID scanner faulty? When should I be prompted for my passcode?\n\nA: Most likely your Touch ID fingerprint scanner is perfectly fine. \nThere are certain rules that iOS uses that govern when your iPhone will prompt you for your passcode, and one of these relates to an 8hr period during which Touch ID has not been used. That alone would explain the scenario in your question (i.e. some nights you’re getting 8+ hrs of sleep, and other nights you’re not).\nAll of the Touch ID rules can be found in Apple’s iOS Security Guide. In summary though, the rules governing when a passcode is required instead of your fingerprint, are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*The passcode has not been used to unlock the device in the last six days\n\n*Your fingerprint has not been used to unlock the device in the last eight hours 1\n\n*You have just powered up (or rebooted) your device\n\n*Your device has not been unlocked for more than 48 hours\n\n*You’ve unsuccessfully tried to use your fingerprint on five consecutive attempts\n\n*Whenever you add a fingerprint to your Touch ID settings\n\n*Your device has received a remote lock command\n\n\nRegarding that last point, this refers to iCloud’s Lost Mode function. For more info you can read iCloud: Use Lost Mode.\nFinally, if you’re still concerned about a possibly faulty Touch ID sensor, you can refer back to the above list as a reference point to determine if you’ve been asked for your passcode under different circumstances. If so, you can use that as a starting point if you seek help from Apple.\n1 This is most likely the cause in your situation most of the time.\n", "Q: Clean install of macOS Sierra not working I'm trying to perform a clean install of macOS Sierra on a late 2009 iMac, but I can't get it to work. The installation comes up with errors every time when it's almost finished. As I've tried a lot of things, I'll list them up first as they come with different errors.\nSomething also notable is that the iMac first failed an upgrade from El Capitan to Sierra via the Mac App Store. It gave the error that the installation had not been successful and should be run again. This, of course, did not work.\nAs there were only old files on the iMac, I decided to perform a clean install. First of all I erased the HDD via macOS Recovery. This all went well without any errors. I rebooted the iMac and went to Recovery and had selected the option to install macOS Sierra. After a long time waiting the installer finally ended up with the error: The installation was unsuccesfull, please try again. So I thought that maybe the installer was at fault so I created a bootable USB.\nFirst I created a bootable USB via my MBP 2016 using the Terminal. It all went well and the USB was located in the Finder as Install macOS Sierra. \nI plugged in the USB to my iMac, held the option key and than the USB didn't show up. After long Googling I found that unplugging and plugging the USB back in while the screen of 'select bootable' was shown, did work. So I selected the USB and went through the process again. But again with the same result. After some more Googling I tried to reset the PRAM with the commandoptionpr keys and booting it up twice. Same result again.\nI than erased the USB and created a new one via the MacDaddy install disk creator. It showed fine in the Finder on my MBP, but the same as the first time for my iMac. And the installation gave the same error.\nAfter some more Googling, I tried to reset the date via the recovery Terminal, via the format: date mmddHHMMYYYY. It than gave a new error upon installation: \"The installer payload failed signature check\".\nAfter more Googling I tried to reset the date via the internet command in Terminal. This reset the date to American Timezone (time.apple.com). Again, with the same results.\nResetting it back to my own timezone via the date command, to be really sure I inserted the correct date, the installation came back with the first error: \"The installation failed, please try it again\".\nI can't find any other solutions on Google and I really hope you guys can help me out.\nNOTE: The error messages were in the Dutch language, so I've tried to translate them as best I can.\n\nA: Title: THREE OPTIONS TO HELP IN YOUR CONCERN\n+\n*FIRST OPTION****......\nIf you continue to have concerns, noting the previous Stated Advise above, is of good quality....May one suggest going to Recovery Mode ...**First: Shut down the computer NEXT: restart holding the Key Stroke: (Option-Command-R)  You will see a box to select you preferred Language (click continue)(FYI: Mandatory: must be connected to the inter-Net via wifi>>> visible in upper top of bar) Next select Disk Utility> Erase the HD Continue by quitting Disk Utility NEXT Select  Reinstall OS X  (MUST HAVE APPLE ID AND PASSWORD for the Install) Finally When Exiting RECOVERY MODE you will be asked to select a start up Disk (there should be only one selection) Click and continue.

It could easily have installed malware.\nAnd maybe don't patch your kernel with instructions from YouTube without knowing exactly what you're doing in future?

I cannot remember why I set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH like this, but what would the effect be of omitting /opt/X11/lib from it?\n\nA: I can think of some ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your /opt/X11/lib/libpng.16.16.dylib. And replace the file with either symlink to the file under anaconda or directly paste the file. \n\n*I think the environment variables can have multiple paths, like $PATH variable. I found that the path you have in front has the precedence over the ones that are written behind it. For example, if your path is /usr1/:/usr2/ then it should check the usr1 directory first and see if the required file exists, before moving to the second one. So you could possibly put your anaconda path in front of the /opt/X11/lib/libpng.16.16.dylib. \n\n*I believe symlinking the file is the best way. I have experienced that kind of things before, I just had to add a symlink and it's fixed. \n\n\nThis answer might explain your last question. \n", "Q: What physical maintenance should I perform on a MacBook Pro?

There's no need to change parts until you need to (e.g. a hard drive fails, a bad memory module, etc). \nSo, the number 1 thing I would recommend is to ensure you have a backup regime in place (e.g. by using Time Machine). So, invest in a number of external hard drives and regularly backup your data on all three MBPs.\n", "Q: 2008 Mac Pro w/o Hard Drive - How do I install a new one?

It's very important to me.Thanks!\n\nA: Apps can choose to not include data in their container from an iTunes backup, so the folder won't appear in a backup. Snapchat do this, which means the container isn't backed up when you do an iTunes backup and the data inside won't be able to be accessed.\nYou can't access other app's containers without jailbreaking.

Between actions 2 and 3 in your workflow, add a Run AppleScript action with the following:\non run {input, parameters}\n    if input is {} then\n        display notification \"File already deleted\"\n        tell me to quit\n    end if\n    return input\nend run\n\nThis checks if the input is empty (because the file can't be found), and if so, runs your desired code — you can customise display notification as you please, such as showing an alert. The use of tell me to quit if the input is empty will stop the workflow at this point.\n\nA: An old question, but a bit more info could be added.\nYou can use other \"Run\" actions Automator, not just AppleScript. You can Run a Shell Script as well. An exit value of the script that is 0 will be deemed a successful check, any other value will be an error. And the equivalent to \"Display notification\" is the stderr from the script. So:\n\n*\n\n*Ask for Text - creates a single-variable dialog\n\n*Set Value of Variable - gives the collected variable a name\n\n*Run Shell Script - pass input to [stdin]\n read -r varname\n if [[ ! \"$varname\" =~ ^SomeValidatingRegexp$ ]]; then\n   echo \"Validation failed!\" >&2\n   exit 1\n fi\n\n\n\n*Ask for Text - next variable\n\n*etc.\n\n", "Q: Installing Windows 8 on Sierra '16 MBP Bootcamp does not recognize anything other than Windows 10 on the new MacBook Pro running Sierra.

In the past, there wasn't helpful information explaining you need to update the iOS - now generally you get an explanation.\nOn iTunes with a USB backup (or Apple Configurator), you get similar experience - you don't get to attempt the restore as code to check prevents the operation from starting.\nWhat you can do is sync data using iCloud and possibly computer / cable / third party apps.

In the past (say, with Snow Leopard, although I don't remember exactly when I set up my old client) it used to be possible to have a \"one-way synchronization\" between the Mail client and a gmail account in the following sense: the Mail client would download any new messages that were sent to my email, but would not notify gmail of any changes that I made locally.\nThe main advantage of this setup is that I could have an unofficial \"cloud storage\": my local client would be where I actually did my work.

I have an iPhone SE that was recently updated to iOS 10 by mistake.  Since it can't be downgraded, I've acquired an identical iPhone SE running iOS 9.3.4.  I know I can't restore a full iOS 10 backup, but is there any way to restore just the Messages from the iOS 10 backup?  \nI don't just mean to extract and save them as a text file or something, I mean actually restore them in Messages so they show up as they normally would, as the history of the people being messaged.\n\nA: No, the database used has changed between iOS 9 and 10, and as such you can't copy the messages database over, since iOS 9 will detect an error with the database and start fresh.\n", "Q: How to export iBooks Author .ipa file to ePub iBooks Author 2.5\nBlank ePub template.\nImport file. \nMake corrections.\nSave.

It will be there (the Notes app by Apple). If it just shows \"Open\" instead of (arrow pointing down from the Cloud), then you do have it on your iPhone, just hidden away \"somewhere\".

I went on a website and some ads (the ones that open up another tab on your screen) popped up.\nThen I did some research and it turns out the website I went to is fake and is known for hacking, however I did not enter any personal data so I just want to know if it's possible that either the website or the ads somehow got a virus into my iPad.\n(note that I did not interact with the ads I just simply closed it after the page loaded!)\n\nA: Short answer\nThe simple answer to your question is that anything is possible. However, is it likely? No.\nLong answer\nTechnically speaking, a virus is just code that replicates itself by creating copies within other pieces of software. One of the best things about iOS is that it doesn't actually allow applications to directly access other software on the device. This makes it, well, almost impossible for a virus to replicate.\nNote: - The only reason I don't say it's impossible is because I basically don't believe anything is impossible!\nNow, in your case, you visited a website that is dodgy and the best thing to do in that situation is to immediately leave the website - and that's exactly what you did!\nAlso, viruses aren't the only things to be wary of. Malware, spyware, worms and trojan horses are all risks for computer users. However, because of the App Store, the risk of these things is extremely remote (from memory, the only reported cases involved the Chinese App Store, and Apple became aware of this very quickly and resolved it).\nSo, in a nutshell, I think the biggest risk you could have faced is malware. That's because dodgy websites are known to use pop ups to inform users that their device is infected with a virus, and then tricks them into installing malware on their device by pretending to help them make it more secure.\nHowever, since you didn't click on anything or download anything the risk is almost nil.\nYou can rest easy.\n\nA: Not really. If you don't visit sketchy websites, there is nothing to worry. You only need to worried if you opened it on an Android device. Browser based exploits aren't fairly common for iOS. Always make sure to be on the latest iOS version, which contains all the latest security fixes.\nThe most recent noted Browser based attack was \"Safari JavaScript pop-up scareware\" in March 2017, which was quickly patched on iOS 10.3, Apple changed the handling of JavaScript pop-ups to prevent this problem, making pop-ups \"per-tab rather than taking over the entire app\". \nTips\n\n\n*\n\n*Use an Adblocker for iOS.\n\n*Clear Website History and Data. Go to Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data and then tap clear.\n\n", "Q: Mac shuts down after loading bar loads 50% I purchased a new Mac (Apple iMac MK142LL/A - Intel Core i5, 1.6Ghz, 21.5 Inch LED, 8GB, 1TB, Intel HD Graphics 6000, OS X El Capitan).

It prompts me to press the home button to activate but the home button on my iPhone doesn't work. Is there a way I can activate this phone without pressing the home button?\n\nA: You need to activate the accessibility function, Voice Over, on your phone. \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone, to a computer with iTunes installed. \n\n*In iTunes, select your device. \n\n*From the Summary pane, click Configure\nAccessibility in the Options section at the bottom. \n\n*Select the Voice Over and click OK.\n\n*Double tap on the Press home to\n    open text.\n\n\nOnce you’re pass the activation, you can disable Voice Over.

For example, how might macOS updates affect accessing my ZFS data pool?\n\n\nI'm open to using MacOS Sierra's RAID tools, but I prefer to use the ZFS file system for this due to its superior data protection and compression features.\n\nA: Yes it is: I am using zfs, including after upgrading to High Sierra and after updating zfs a few times.\nAfter updating macOS I vaguely recall reinstalling zfs for this version of macOS (and possibly uninstalling it first--fairly certain I followed the directions associated with the installer or in the wiki), and then later as zfs was updated installed the newer release.

I then want everything synced to my Mac Mini, but not to my iPad, which has limited storage capacity.\nIs it possible to have the Mac Mini and iPad set up to backup to iCloud, but only download backed-up photos to the desktop?\n\nA: By default, iCloud Photo Library only downloads thumbnails of your photos onto each individual device. When you view a photo, a device-optimized version is downloaded. Higher-resolution versions may be pulled down as you zoom in. The full-resolution version isn’t downloaded until you try to Edit or Share the photo.\nThis default setting is best on space-limited devices such as an iPad or iPhone. As I mentioned, only thumbnails are downloaded by default, so you will not fill up your iPad’s storage. As your device runs out of space, iOS/macOS will automatically purge local copies and retain only thumbnails, as needed.\nWhen you enable iCloud Photo Library, make sure Optimize iPad Storage is checked under Settings → Photos & Camera:\n\nOn your Mac Mini, open Photos and make sure Download Originals to this Mac is selected under Photos → Preferences → iCloud:\n\nThe above configuration will cause your Mac Mini to keep a full-resolution copy of all your photos, with only thumbnails downloaded to your iPad by default, and everything backed up in iCloud.\nBe aware that these photos will consume your iCloud data allowance. You may need to subscribe to an iCloud storage plan.\n", "Q: With Homebrew, how to check if a software/package is installed? I'm installing a set of softwares/packages/formulas via homebrew with command like\nbrew install <formula1>\n...\nbrew cask install <formula2>\n...\n\nI wonder if it's a good idea to verify if the softwares <formula1>, ..., <formula2>, ... are already installed and only trigger the above commands for the ones NOT already installed. If so, how?\n\nA: you could do something like this: \nbrew list <formula1> || brew install <formula1>\n\nThis will error on list and continue with install if not installed otherwise it will just list package files. (one could modify this further as a function or alias in .bashrc to make it easier to type)\n\nA: Building on the earlier answers, but packed into a ready to use function without all the homebrew logging:\nbrew_install() {\n    echo \"\\nInstalling $1\"\n    if brew list $1 &>/dev/null; then\n        echo \"${1} is already installed\"\n    else\n        brew install $1 && echo \"$1 is installed\"\n    fi\n}\n\nbrew_install \"ripgrep\"\n\n\nA: It should also be noted that you can type brew info <formula> which will tell you whether or not a formula is installed. You can parse the response for \"Not installed\" and then run the installer if it finds the string.\n\nA: In similar vein to Hans Fredric, here is a snippet I actually use myself. The funny looking <(cmd) is Bash command substitution.\nalias strip-empty=\"egrep -v '^\\s*$'\"\nNOT_INSTALLED=$(comm -23 <(sort < apps.local) <( brew list --versions | awk '{print $1}' ) | strip-empty)\nwhile read FORMULA; do\n    brew install \"$FORMULA\"\ndone <<< \"$NOT_INSTALLED\"\n\nHere, apps.local is just a list of apps to install, one per line. The improvement over just looping over each app and trying something like brew_install basically comes down to speed. Invoking brew list is slow (like up to a second), so I just do the test once by listing out all installed apps. The difference is very noticeable if you have > 5 apps.\nIf you need something with the same speed, but that works equally well with apps installed using a cask, you need something more elaborate (like this).\n", "Q: Recover contacts etc from old iCloud account after iPhone reset I reset my iPhone 6, meaning I lost all my information, contacts, photos. When my phone turned on again, I had to enter my iCloud, and because I had forgotten my iCloud password, I had to put in a new login and password, and create a new iCloud account. \nUnfortunately I have no backup.\nI am wondering if there is some way I can recover my contacts and other information from my old iCloud account?\n\nA: You must try and reset your old iCloud accounts password. \nIf you have ever synced or made a backup on iTunes on your computer then try to get it back from there. \n", "Q: iPhone says it is verifying update, but it's stuck on lock screen I can't unlock my iPhone and it has been saying it's verifying the update for hours now. I can't turn it off or restart it because the button is broken. I can't even unlock my iPhone or slide to power off when using AssistiveTouch.\nHow do I get around this problem?\n\nA: Let the battery deplete. After the device shuts down on it own, leave it for a few mins and then put it on charge.\nIf that fails, you might have to repair the hardware or connect it to iTunes / Apple Configurator 2 to update over lightning connection.\n", "Q: Is it possible to merge two health sources without losing data? I am using the Health app on iOS 10.3.2 (14F5089a) with 2 Apple Watches paired. However, there are more than 2 watches listed in the Sources tab. I know that only one listing contains the data for one Apple Watch, but the other Apple Watch has 4 listings with only one marked as 'still paired'.\nIs there a way I can merge the 4 listings with the least amount of data loss possible?\n\nA: Please don't delete any Apple Watch from the sources tab if you care about your health records.\nYou can't merge these entries.

I'm trying to separately crop PDF's even and odd pages, by building on top of the accepted answer from How to crop odd and even pages differently in a PDF?\nMy Automator workflow, roughly:\n\n\n*\n\n*automatically Extract Odd & Even Pages; each output PDF filename is suffixed with \"(Even Pages)\" or \"(Odd Pages)\"\n\n*pause Automator Workflow with Ask for Confirmation and manually crop each of the two output PDFs (using Rectangular Selection and Crop in Preview)\n\n*select the two cropped PDFs using Get Folder Contents\n\n*Combine PDF Pages with Shuffling pages option \n\n\nThe issue is step 4. which inevitably seems to drop any Crop from step 2. The combined PDF has no crop applied to it, even though the two even & odd input PDFs are definitely cropped.\nIs this expected behaviour from Combine PDF Pages? PDF metadata and annotations do seem to get dropped, does Crop as well? \n\n\nA: There is a package called pdfjoin which uses pdflatex to combine pdf files. You could try joining your pdf's in the following way:\npdfjoin 01.pdf 02.pdf\n\nwhich will combine the files into a single pdf called 02-combined.pdf, in your current working directory.\nIf you don't have LaTeX installed you can follow this guide to do so. \nThis preserved crops for me when I tried. If you can get this working on your system, you could then maybe look at putting this together in a bash script.\n\nA: Preview does not 'destructively' crop images. (It tells you as much when you crop a PDF.)\nThere are four different 'boxes' used to describe the page size of a PDF. When you crop a PDF in Preview, it alters the 'cropBox', but the entire page data is still there in the 'mediaBox', and it is this value that Automator uses to get the PDF pages.\nThe Combine Pages action uses (at its heart) a python script to combine the pages. This loads each page into a new CoreGraphics object, which is also why the metadata and annotations get dropped. It should be possible to create a script that uses the cropBox instead of mediaBox, and which preserves annotations.\n", "Q: Fast image preview in macOS context menu (right click) There was a cool app on windows, I believe it was called FastPreview - when you right click an image, you will get the small image preview right in the context menu.\nI find this very convenient. Is there anything like that on mac?\nEdit\nI forgot to mention that I don't use Finder that much, but an alternative file manager. For that reason, I am asking this.\n\nA: On Mac it's called Quicklook & is much more powerful than just a quick jpg preview, it can also preview text, pdfs, spreadsheets, audio, movies & even much more specialist data types - anything there's a plugin for.\nThere are two simple ways...\n\n\n*\n\n*In column view a preview will always show to the right of the selected item. [This is a pref, accessed by hitting  Cmd ⌘   J  from any open Finder window, but defaults to on]\nThe size of the preview is dependant on the column width.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Alternatively, from any view, just tap the Spacebar - the preview will pop out at full size [or to fit screen]. You can resize by dragging a corner, same as any window.\nThis usually has an 'Open With' choice at the top to go straight to the default app for that file type [circled in red].\nYou can change the currently viewed item by changing your selection. You don't need to be able to see behind the preview for this, you can step around using the arrow keys.\nPressing Spacebar a second time clears Quicklook.\n\n\n\nQuicklook is also available from some other apps, such as Mail, for viewing attachments that don't auto-inline, like text files, or if the view is too small, for instance a pdf.\n\nA: On your desktop or in finder app all you have to do is select an image or video file, then tap your spacebar on your keyboard.  This will open a quick preview window.  This also works with a bunch of other file extensions.\n", "Q: Custom group in characters viewer I am trying to start with Gitmoji and so far it takes me some time to find the appropriate emoji in the Characters viewer on macOS. Is it possible to define custom group of characters? There is already Emoji, Arrows, Bullets/Stars. I am looking for a way how to add my own. I am not interested into workarounds like using Favorites group\n\nA: The easiest way is to use each of the gitmoji emoji a bunch of times and then they will be in your frequently used list in the Emoji & Symbols picker.\nThe categories/groups are defined by Unicode as ranges of the character set. I am not aware that it is possible to define your own. There are no clues in CharacterPicker.framework.\nYou could also setup keyboard text replacements so you can type :apple: and it will be automatically replaced with . I use Alfred to do this, but you could use System Preferences > Keyboard > Text to do it.\nYou could also try Dash, a document viewer/browser, that can be configured to show a Gitmoji cheat sheet.

In this case I want to open them with these screen sizes -- more or less. If it has to be a terminal command, is it possible to create a shortcut for it? I will be creating more shortcuts for multiple app / screen size combinations.\n\n\nA: Position your windows how you desire, then run the following AppleScript for each application.\ntell application \"Terminal\" to tell window 1 to get bounds\n\nThis will return the bounds of the window, such as:\n{200, 200, 700, 700}\n\nOnce you have your bounds of each window you wish to include in your specific window layout set, use the following to set the bounds:\ntell application \"Terminal\" to tell window 1 to set bounds to {200, 200, 700, 700}\n\nYou can use multiple lines to set multiple window bounds at the same time.\nOnce you're happy with your layout, Script Editor can save the script as an application (File → Export and choose File Format: Application). This can then be added to your Dock for easy access.\n\nIf the application you're trying to manipulate is not scriptable, such as Sublime Text, you can use System Events to tell the application. This will require you to enable Accessibility control in System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility.\nTo get the bounds of a window of a non-scriptable application, you can use:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Sublime Text\" to ¬\n    get {size, position} of window 1\n\nThis will return the size and position of the window, such as:\n{{500, 500}, {200, 200}}\n\nTo set the bounds of a non-scriptable application, using the result of the previous code:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Sublime Text\" to ¬\n    tell window 1 to set {size, position} to {{500, 500}, {200, 200}}\n\n\nIf the application whose windows you are trying to manipulate are not open prior to running this script, use the following:\ntell application \"Terminal\" to activate\n\nThis can be combined with setting the bounds using:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    tell window 1 to set bounds to {200, 200, 700, 700}\nend tell\n\nNo delay is necessary since AppleScript will wait for the application to open.\n", "Q: Earpods doesn't work on iPhone7 There is a big problem with the EarPods that I get with my new iPhone 7.\nInside the Apple box there was also an adapter for the 3.5mm jack and it works perfectly with other type of headphones (with 3.5mm jack) on my phone. \nHowever the Earpods with the lightning work only on my friend's iPhone 7, not with mine.

I own a 2015 Macbook Pro 15\" with these specs:\n\nSometimes red/grey squares appear below/around text labels, like this:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, all kinds of apps are effected, like the Dock or Calendar. Also, the squares sometimes have a dark red, sometimes grayish color. When I hover with the mouse over the Dock icons the labels start changing their color between red and grey.\nWhen I restart the app (e.g. use killall dock) the squares are gone but they will re-appear later.\nIt doesn't matter if I use an external display or the integrated display of the Macbook, the problem will occur on both.\nOnly thing I noticed is that if I attach both my external monitors to it (27\" Thunderbolt Display and 27\" Cinema Display) and if I drag an app, e.g. Calendar, from the Cinema Display to the Thunderbolt Display, suddenly the squares appear. If I drag the app back to the other monitor, the squares disappear. The rectangles in the Dock appear on both monitors though.\nSo far that's all that happens. It's not to bad but it's a bit annoying.\nAlso, I need this computer for work, so if it's a hardware problem I don't want it to die suddenly in the middle of important work.\nSo far I haven't tried to reinstall macOS yet since, as I said, I need the computer for work and don't want to fiddle around with it to much since it's working smoothly besides the issue with the rectangles.\nWhat do you think could be the issue here? Is it hardware or software? Would macOS reinstall help? Is it a known issue? Do I have to go see the genius bar? Really want to avoid that :-(\n\nA: Finally found out what's wrong. I had been using a custom calibration for my monitors since their color temperature was different to each other. After resetting the calibration to default the issue is gone.\n", "Q: How to do a complete refresh in Safari 10.1.1 on MacOS Sierra I'm developing a website and there's a text input in my website's top menu and what bothering me is:\nI loaded the site in Safari before my style.css file was edited and after that I edited my style.css and gave a border-radius styling to my text input now I can't make safari show the changes, Of course it is working very well in windows after I pressed ctrl+F5.

You can observe the effect in the Web Inspector's Network tab.\n                                                            \n\nWhat I suspect is catching you out here is how a force refresh only bypasses cache for the same domain as the site you're refreshing. Even with a force refresh, resources may still be cached, such as from CDN domains.\n                                                                       \nTo bypass cache for all resources, open the web inspector, choose the Network tab, then select ‘Ignore the resource cache when loading resources’.

I've got an external USB drive with a few VeraCrypt volumes. I want to use one of them for my Time Machine backups. The partition can be deleted entirely, I just wish to keep it encrypted with VeraCrypt. \nIs this possible? When trying to set things up like this, I cannot select this partition as a backup volume in Time Machine settings.\nI know I can also create and format a regular partition and use that in Time Machine, and use macOS' or Time Machine's own encryption. But I prefer VeraCrypt.\nNote that I'm not using a VeraCrypt container, but an actual partition. Which is then mounted and formatted with regular HPFS+, so I would say after mounting it's virtually the same as without VeraCrypt. But somehow Time Machine won't allow me to select this volume...?\n\nA: You need to add the partition manually. In Terminal type\nsudo tmutil setdestination -a /Volumes/YourBackupVolume\n\nCheck your Time Machine destinations with tmutil destinationinfo before and after adding the new Volume.\n\nA: Apple does a lot of things quite good when it comes to usability. This was everything else than easy, when you don't know what you're doing :)\nFor me the first answer was not enough because I'm missing a lot of infos here: Such as you need to have a sparse bundle on the USB device to do that, it needs to be mounted etc. \nSo I'll try to lead you step by step through it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow this excellent guide. You  don't need a MAC address though since it's a USB device.\n\n\nUsing a networked drive for Time Machine backups (on a Mac)\n  10th October 2009 at 20:13\nYou'll find similar information to this around the web, but I find it fiddly enough to piece together reliably, and I need it often enough, that I thought I'd blog about it. That way it at least gives me a single place to look. Maybe it will help others too. Much of the specifcs, especially the hdiutil command line and the ifconfig trick, I sourced from this thread in the ReadyNAS forums. Note that the advice is by no means specific to ReadyNAS drives (I have a Thecus NAS myself). Many thanks to btaroli in that thread for the insight.\nTime Machine\nTime Machine is Apple's easy-to-use backup system, baked into OS X (as of Leopard). Unfortunately it doesn't allow you to back-up to a networked drive out of the box. Enabling this ability is pretty easy. Early on there were some reliability issues - which were largely due to the fact that Time Machine created a disk image (more specifically, a sparse bundle) on the network drive, and this was prone to corruption if the network connection was disrupted during a backup. I don't know if all the issues here have been entirely resolved now, but it does seem more reliable. Apple's own Time Capsule, which has been specifically designed to work with Time Machine, uses this same method, so it is no longer an entirely unsupported technique.\nEnabling Time Machine for network drives\nSo how do you enable backing up to network drives? Open a terminal window and paste the following in (then hit return, of course):\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\nMounted network drives will then show up in the list of destinations available for storing backups.\nGetting a working disk image\nUnfortunately this is not always enough. Often, after doing this, Time Machine will appear to start preparing a backup then fail with a cryptic error code. The error I have seen is:\nTime Machine could not complete the backup.\n     The backup disk image \"/Volumes/backups-1/Wall-E.sparsebundle\" could not be created (error 45). \n\"Error 45\"? What's that. If I try to create a sparse image myself in the same location I'm told, \"the operation could not be completed\". This is not much more helpful. If you google there are many references around to these errors - mostly in forums. Many of them are not terrible helpful, or require a lot of knowledge and/ or patience.\nI still don't really know what the problem is, although I suspect it's something to do with permissions and/ or attributes. Either way the solution generally seems to be to create the sparse image manually using a command called hdiutil. If you get this right then Time Machine will think it created it and just start using it. Simple eh? Well, it's not rocket science - but it does involve piecing a few things together. The name of the sparse bundle has to be something very specific which is made up from a few pieces of information unique to your set-up. I'll now take you through how to find those pieces of information.\nFinding the Computer Name\nWe'll start with the easy one. The computer name. Specifically this is whatever the computer is named in the Sharing preferences. So open System Preferences, select \"Sharing\", and copy the name from the \"Computer Name\" section at the top.\nFinding the MAC Address\nThis is the physical address of your network card (not your IP address, which is a logical address. Also the term \"MAC\" here is nothing to do with your Mac as a computer - it stands for Media Access Control address).\nNow you have to be careful here. Most macs these days have at least two network cards! You will probably have an ethernet port (for a network cable connection) as well as wifi. You may also have a USB based device, such as a mobile broadband device. Regardless of which one you use to connect to the network drive you'll be backing up to, the address we need is of the first network card (usually the ethernet port). If this seems a bit odd at first, consider the case where you usually connect over wifi, but to do an initial backup you connect by cable. If the backup name was dependant on the network connection used this wouldn't work. The address is only used to identify your computer.\nAnyway, it turns out there is an easy way to obtain this.\nBack in the terminal window, type the following:\nifconfig en0 | grep ether | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/://g'\nWhat's that doing? The short answer is \"don't worry, it works\". The slightly longer answer is that ifconfig dumps all the information it has about all it's ethernet ports. The first port is called en0, so the command ifconfig en0 dumps information about just that one. The pipe character, |, is the unix instruction for sending the output of one command to the input of the next. So we send the information from en0 to \"grep ether\", which filters out just the lines that have the word \"ether\" in them - which in this case happen to be where the MAC addresses are shown. To get that line into the form we need for our filename we pipe it to another command, awk, which just picks out the second part of the string, then finally to sed, which removes the colons.\nPhew.\nLike I said, it just works. Trust me.\nCreating the sparsebundle\nNow we have the information we need to create the name of the sparsebundle. Following is the instruction you need to issue to create it. Replace the  and  placeholders with the information we obtained above. You may need to change the size parameter (320g here) if you have a large drive to back up. The disk image doesn't take up that space to start with, but will grow up to the size you specify here, so use it to set an upper limit. Also you will be prompted to enter your admin password (sudo runs the command as SuperUser):\nsudo hdiutil create -size 320g -type SPARSEBUNDLE -nospotlight -volname \"Backup of <computer_name>\" -fs \"Case-sensitive Journaled HFS+\" -verbose ~/Desktop/<computer_name>_<mac address>.sparsebundle\nNote that this will create the sparsebundle on your desktop. Once there you can copy it to the desired location on your network drive (then delete from your desktop). This seems to be more reliable than creating it in place.\nOnce you've done that you can start Time Machine and point it at the drive where the sparsebundle resides and it will find it and start using it. If this still fails, check that the name is exactly right and that you followed all the steps above carefully.\nNow sit back and relax, knowing that all your hard work is being backed up\n\n\n*When you have your sparse bundle on your USB device, you need to mount that device with this - be aware I only added the mac address name for consistency to the guide: hdiutil attach -mountpoint ~/myMountPoint <computer_name>_<mac address>.sparsebundle\n\n*Use the aforementioned command: sudo tmutil setdestination -a ~/myMountPoint\n\n*Go to your system preferences -> time machine -> activate menu button\n\n*Finally do this: Click on the time machine button in your system tray and click start backup and be happy :D\n\n\nI hope you saved some of the 1.5 hours I spent puzzling this together, although it was kinda fun ;)\n", "Q: I can't find the contact after I saved them on my IPhone 5S, I can't find the contact after I saved them on my IPhone 5S, I have searched for the name after I saved the number but couldn't find it, I don't know how to solve this issue I can't even find it in the Apps like Whats App..

Would you have to do it from the command line?\n\nA: So you asked two questions, and I'll address the second one first, \"Would you have to do it from the command line?\", no, it does not have to be done from the command line.\nAs to your first question, \"How can I \"unzip\" or extract files from Xcode.8.3.2.xip.file on 2009 MacBook?\", you would have to have the Late 2009 MacBook, which supports macOS Sierra, and have macOS Sierra installed. Then assuming the Xcode.8.3.2.xip.file was in your Downloads folder, you simply double-click it.\nThis will cause Archive Utility to expand the file by first verifying the digital signature it contains, and expand it to the Xcode.app application bundle, at first located within the TMPDIR, e.g on my system it was /private/var/folders/7c/wmqb3p_14hq_6g1vtj20rv0h0000gn/T/Cleanup At Startup/.BAH.vW5Gr/Xcode.app and then it gets moved to the, e.g., ~/Downloads folder, where you'd then manually move it to /Applications.\n", "Q: WiFi Performance via Terminal Is it possible to test the performance of a WiFi via the terminal?\nBasically, I want to check how good WiFi is in some spaces of my home to figure out where to place a access points.\nCan the terminal help me with that in any way?\n\nA: You can use the built in airport utility to measure SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio).  It's found in \n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport\nWhat I do is make a symlink to a directory in my path so I can call it without having to remember that long path:\nln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport\n\nAssuming that you are connected to a WiFi network, issue the command:\nairport -I\nto print out information of your current connection.\n$ airport -I\n     agrCtlRSSI: -65\n     agrExtRSSI: 0\n    agrCtlNoise: -90\n    agrExtNoise: 0\n          state: running\n        op mode: station\n     lastTxRate: 243\n        maxRate: 300\nlastAssocStatus: 0\n    802.11 auth: open\n      link auth: wpa2-psk\n          BSSID: 82:2a:a9:45:f3:25\n           SSID: StackExchange WiFi Demo\n            MCS: 14\n        channel: 157,1\n\nTo calculate SNR, you take the RSSI value and subtract the Noise value.  In this case, I have an RSSI of -65dB and a Noise value of -90dB.  Calculated, that gives me 25dB.   Which is a very good signal (just barely but I am behind a reinforced concrete wall away from my AP; not bad actually considering.\nSNR Guidelines\n\n\n*\n\n*40dB+ SNR = Excellent signal\n\n*25dB to 40dB SNR = Very good signal\n\n*15dB to 25dB SNR = Low signal\n\n*10dB to 15dB SNR = Very low signal\n\n*5dB to 10dB SNR = No signal\n\n\nThat said..it's not all down to what your SNR is in a given location, you should also consider things like:\n\n\n*\n\n*WiFi Saturation - excessive number of WiFi signals in the same area\n\n*Client Load - number of clients attached to a given AP\n\n*Bandwidth utilization - how much bandwidth is consumed by the clients.\n\n\nIf you have too many WiFi networks competing for the same bandwidth or a combination of too many users or too many bandwidth hogs (everyone watching Netflix 4K on their tablets), this will greatly affect performance beyond what your SNR can tell you.\nWhat I prefer to do is to deploy multiple APs around the house and turn down the transmit power so they don't go very far outside the room I am trying to cover.  I personally use these PoE Access Points from Ubiquiti to cover several areas of my home with great success.\n", "Q: How is the \"Memory\" column calculated in Activity Monitor? How is the per-process \"Memory\" column calculated in Activity Monitor? The name is quite vague and I haven't found anyone say anything about it aside from stuff like, e.g., \"Memory used in RAM.\" I can't quite tell the relation between it and real memory, shared memory, private memory, dirty memory, etc.\nFYI, I'm talking about this column:\n\n\nA: The Memory column is overall memory consumption, excluding compression, etc. going on.  The Compressed Mem column is how much memory is being saved by the operating system's memory compression algorithm.  The Real Mem column essentially shows Memory - Compressed Mem to give you an idea of how much actual memory is being consumed by the process.  Private Mem shows you how much memory is being consumed by this particular process that is not being shared by any other processes and of course then Shared Mem would be what's being shared with other processes.\nAs far as actually tracking the memory consumption itself, I would have to dig a bit more into the developer documentation as I don't know off the top of my head how Xnu/Darwin tracks memory consumption on a per process basis to actually report such figures.\nPlease let me know if you're looking for any additional details or clarification as your previous question is slightly vague with regards to whether you're seeking specific acquisition details or just what the columns mean...\n\nA: The column appears to correspond to phys_footprint, which you can get from passing TASK_VM_INFO to task_info.

I've noticed that unlike on macOS, I can't access my Wi-Fi passwords when in iOS (only browser passwords are populated in my Settings → Safari → Passwords).\nIs it possible to sync that Wi-Fi password (or all Wi-Fi passwords, doesn't matter) somehow from my iOS device to my macOS device?\n\nA: Wi-Fi passwords are synchronised over iCloud Keychain and your iOS device will use stored AirPort network passwords when connecting to a Wi-Fi network. However, they do not show in Safari passwords since they are not for use in Safari. You cannot access stored Wi-Fi network passwords on iOS.\n", "Q: How do I view PDF attachments to my Google Calendar event synched with my iPhone? I synched my Google Calendar with the iOS Calendar app (iOS 10.3.2) by adding my Google account. I can see the attachments and file size in the event, but when I click on it to view the PDF file, it brings up a gray screen. Multiple attachments to multiple events do not work. I can share or click Done. The attachments work in the desktop web site.\nI can see the attachments in the Calendar event on my phone, but when I click on them, it only brings up a blank page without any content. The file size shows in the list of attachments too.\n \n\nA: This was, and continues to be, a bug with the way the iPhone calendar app handles Google Calendar attachments. It’s been this way for years.\n\nA: After testing, the only \"solution\" (read \"work-around\") to this at the moment is to upload each attachment to Google Drive and then to add its raw link in the Notes section. I say raw link, because using the \"Link\" feature of the Google Calendar app will result in the less-than-pretty HTML code when viewed on iOS, e.g. <a href=\"https://drive.asset.blah.blah.blah.pdf\">Asset Name</a>. Thus, the best you can get ATM for fully interoperable compatibility is NOT using either of the Google Calendar features 1) Attachments or 2) Links and instead in the Notes section just providing a short name for the asset followed by the raw Drive link for the asset.\nE.g.\nNOTES:\nGoogle & Apple's relationship: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c7A47J0O4wgK1wFBRbEn4Gpc8Ht1XeE2/view?usp=sharing\n", "Q: How can I text using my Mac without having an iPhone to Android devices? My 85 yo Mom doesn't have a cell phone but does have a Mac. My son is going to college and she wants to keep in touch but he only texts and has an Android. I think I can set-up iMessage on her Mac as she has an Apple ID, but can she send texts to Android phones?  \nShe also has an iPad but has trouble using it.\n\nA: Why not go with Skype?\nIt has clients for Mac, PC, iPhone, and Android.  It even has the option to send native SMS (text) messages but there really is no need if both parties have a Skype client.\nBest of all, she can message, voice and video chat.\n\nA: Yes, she can use Messages on her Mac to text to anyone with an email address or phone number.  Here's and Apple page on how to setup Messages on her Mac.  She has to make sure her Mac has an active internet connection (you might need to check that for her first).  You didn't mention the type of iMac she has so this assumes she has the latest operating system.\nIt's very simple, she just needs to start a conversation in Messages and then add your son's Android phone number or its email address (every internet-enabled phone will have an email address).

How do I disable autocomplete on macOS Sierra for MacBook, please, without disabling it on iOS 10 for iPhone? \nSeems to occur only in native/Apple apps. Appears below my typing as blue text in a white rectangle with a close button on its right.\nIt flashes for a split second before inserting its suggestion into my typing, without feedback from me.\nThe suggestions are listed in Syst Prefs / Keyboard / Text / Replace…With.

How'd they get there? \nIf I delete them from the Mac, they also delete from the phone. How might I remove/disable them from one but not the other? Thank you. \n\nA: Explanation\nThe text replacements in System Preferences > Keyboard > Text (macOS) and Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement (iOS) are tightly integrated into iCloud.\nIn fact, both sync using iCloud and are stored in your iCloud Drive (com.apple.TextInput). This is an invisible folder.\n\nDisable text replacements on macOS\nIn order to disable them on your Mac, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: In Settings > iCloud > iCloud disable 'iCloud Drive'.\n\n*macOS: In System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive (Options) disable 'System Preferences'.\n\n\nNow you need to delete your text replacements from your Mac.

Booting is not an issue for my use of this flash drive.\nThe second one (Master Boot Record) is old, from the 80's DOS 2, for old PCs. Why is this offered as a scheme for \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\"? That really threw me, and prompted this Question.\nThe third one (Apple Partition Map) is for booting old Macs (68K and PowerPC rather than Intel chips).\nMysterious error when formatting higher item\nNo matter what Scheme I choose, I get an error when trying to format the item higher in the hierarchy in the sidebar to the left (Lexar USB Flash…), as shown in the screen shot above. Why?\nIf I select the secondary item in that list (Lexar), I can successfully do a format operation. But the \"Scheme\" popup menu does not appear in the panel. \nWhat is the difference between the two items in hierarchy? Does it make sense that I cannot choose a Scheme on the secondary one?\n\nA: Sadly, Disk Utility has been made progressively worse in recent versions of the Mac OS (macOS or OS X or whatever).\nUsually, as mentioned already, the correct scheme is GUID. You only need MBR if you will be talking to the drive using older versions of Windows (XP and earlier if I remember correctly), and only need the old Apple scheme when using early versions of Mac OS (pre-OS X?).\nHowever, regarding your inability to format the 'drive' rather than the 'partition', try selecting the partition button along the top of Disk Utility. That should allow you to create a partition on the drive and set the partition scheme. Then select the partition on the left hand side and format it using the filesystem of your choice.\n\nA: In virtually all cases, you want GUID Partition Map. Only choose a different scheme if you have specific needs that require that scheme. GUID Partition Map provides the best compatibility and is the most current scheme.\nWithout knowing what the error is, I can't say why you're unable to erase the disk. The top level item is the disk itself, whereas the lower level items are partitions. When erasing a specific partition, you're only changing that partition, not the whole disk. Since the scheme is for the entire disk and not one partition, it doesn't make sense to have the scheme show for a partition.\n\nA: It might be a permission issue. I had a flash drive I tried to format on my dad's MacBook and I had the same problem — it wouldn't let me erase or format the partition. When I got home and put it back in my Mac mini I was able to format it without any issues. \n", "Q: Add text on line I'm trying to add some text on a connection line. And when I move the connected shape, the text will move with the line.\nHow can I bind the text to the line?\n\n\n\nA: This is currently not possible whilst keeping the connection line attached to the other shapes. To keep the text associated with the line, you can group them together, but then the connection line isn't fixed to the shapes any more.\nIt is possible to group the connected shapes, line and text all together, such that you can move the whole group as one, however this doesn't work for your example where you only move one of the shapes and want the text to move too.\nYou can provide feedback to Apple here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/feedback/keynote.html\n\nA: You can create a connected figure with some text on a line. The trick is to make the line really two lines, and to join them end-to-end on the narrow center of the double arrow shape.\nPlan:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a textual label that floats to the side of a connection point. \n\n*Connect two vertical lines from that connection point to one shape above and another shape below. The two lines make an imperceptible 180-degree joint at the connection point. The result is a connected figure that appears to be one labeled line.\n\n*If you don't want your labeled line to be vertical, you can rotate the connection point.\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the textual label:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the plus, which acts as an Add menu. Choose the shapes. From the Basic shapes, choose the double-headed arrow.\n\n*Use the green dot in that double arrow to resize the arrow shaft until it is a very thin line.\n\n*Type in the double arrow. Your text goes in one of the arrow heads.\n\n*Leave that double arrow selected.\n\n*Press the paintbrush, which acts as a Format menu.\n\n*In Style > Fill, go to the shades of gray. Choose white.\n\n*In Text > Color, choose black.\n\n\n*Connect the two vertical lines:\n\n\n*\n\n*Place a shape above the white double arrow.\n\n*Place another shape below the white double arrow.\n\n*Make lines to connect each of those two shapes to the white double arrow. The lines connect to the white double arrow on its very thin arrow shaft.\n\n\nI had to learn how to make connections between shapes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a curve to the page.\n\n*Drag each end of the curve until it snaps to one of your shapes.\n\n*Now you can format the curve's connection style as \"Straight\".\n\n\n*Rotate the connection point:\n\n\n*\n\n*Place two separated fingertips on the white double arrow. Turn the double arrow by rotating the two fingertips around a spot between them.\n\n*Move the shapes until each of their lines are connected to the arrow shaft again.\n\n\n", "Q: Plugging iPhone gives IP address on a new network interface Plugging my iPhone on my MacBook Pro shows me a new network interface en7 and allocates an IP address.\n$ifconfig \nen7: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    inet 169.254.134.xxxx netmask 0xffff0000 broadcast 169.254.255.255\n\nWhy is this and what is it for?\n\nA: This is for tethering.

The device still works good. But because there is old software on it, I can't do anything with it. \nIs it recommended, or do you recommend to do something else with the iPad/iPod?\nI have an iPod Touch 3 and an iPad 1.\n\nA: The last available version of iOS for the iPod Touch 3rd generation and iPad first generation is iOS 5.1.1. It is not possible to update your iOS device beyond this version.\nYou can download apps for older versions of iOS by adding the app to your purchase history using iTunes on your computer, since iTunes is version-agnostic. Once you've downloaded the app on iTunes, it will be in your purchase history and attempting to download it again on your device should prompt you to accept an older version of the app.\n", "Q: How to manually 'install' a command-line based Java application consisting of an executable and several auxiliary modules? I'd like to use Briss, a Java application for cropping pdf files. The application consists of a compressed folder containing several Java .jar files.

The application has a GUI, but is run from the Terminal by running the following command line:\njava -jar briss-0.9.jar\n\nHow can I 'install' this application so that I can run it by typing the above command in a freshly opened Terminal window?\nOne way to do it would be to dump all the .jar files inside /usr/local/bin, but I'd rather not pollute the bin folder with a horde of files, and also I'd like to keep the files together, so that, for instance, the application can be easily and cleanly 'uninstalled'.\n\nA: Copy the files to somewhere static such as ~/Applications, then add the following to your profile:\nalias briss=\"java -jar /path/to/briss-0.9.jar\"\n\nThen you can run ‘briss’ from Terminal from anywhere.\nYou may need to create ~/Applications if you haven't used it before.

It is definitely website specific as only a few domains keep popping up while others could be deleted. I tried rebooting my device, clearing safari history and manually deleting each cookie but nothing worked.\nWhat fixed the problem was restoring my iPhone from a recent backup before I've visited the websites.

Apple app reflects Active Calories and Total Calories during a work out and I am not able to find an answer to define the difference.  what is the difference in a work out from Active vs Total.  I am still on the fence about this app, fitbit showed when during my work out my heartrate increased, and clearly reflected the calories -\n\nA: Active calories are a result of your activity (running, swimming, etc.) only.\nTotal calories take into account how many calories your body consumes during that period of time (just to keep you alive) as well as the active calories.\n\nA: Simply put, active calories are those you burn while walking, climbing, jogging — whatever you do for exercise. Total calories include active calories and resting calories, which are those your body burns naturally, even when you're just lounging on the couch.\nFor instance, when I use a rowing machine at the gym, the meter attached to the rowing machine will estimate the number of calories I burned while rowing and, if that meter were an Apple Watch, those calories would be the active calories.  The rowing machine does not know your age/height/weight and thus cannot estimate your resting calories.\n\nA: Active calories is the calories you burn exercising.\nResting calories is the calories your body burn while resting. The energy to “function”.\nTotal calories is the sum of both.\n", "Q: A purchased and downloaded iTunes television show will not play A heads up - I am a complete layman with absolutely no knowledge of operating system or hardware stuff aside from the fact that I have no knowledge of it.

They are, in order of when I tried them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstalling and reinstalling the show\n\n*Closing and reopening the iTunes application\n\n*Turning off and back on my laptop\n\n*Unauthorizing and reauthorizing my computer\n\n*Waiting it out for twelve hours\n\n\nNothing I have done has in any way altered the problem which presents itself when I try to watch the show. I have no problems watching videos on YouTube; it is simply shows purchased via iTunes which refuse to work properly. This problem has not occurred prior to today, though when I tried to watch a different show (I forget off the top of my head which one I clicked) that didn't work either.\nSince I posted this 24 hours ago I have managed to successfully use iTunes to play music. I downloaded Star Wars episode I and tried watching that, but alas, movies do not work either. The 30-second bit that plays as a trailer for the new episode of a television show, however, did manage to play succesfully after a minute of there being a black screen like what I described, leading me to maybe suspect that this is a buffering problem.\n\nA: I opened the App Store and found iTunes update to version 12.6.1.  Ran the update and now my TV shows are playing.  Hope this works for you as well.\n", "Q: Can I run a terminal on IOS with sandboxed filesystem (w/o jailbreak)? Can I run a terminal app on IOS with a sandboxed filesystem (no jailbreak).  E.g. is there an app that allows me to locally install linux on an IOS device (without jailbreak)?\nMore precisely: I am not looking for an ssh client, but for a way to install locally on IOS e.g. something like homebrew, e.g. to use arbitrary programming languages or emacs or vim or latex or clojure or haskell or etc ;)\nSo, it would be totally fine, if such an app has its own unix-style file system and only commandline, i.e. no GUI.\n\nA: Sorry to resurrect an old question. . .\nI was actually browsing for info on a new iOS app that sort of does just what this question is asking about, emulates a Linux environment via a pretty slick terminal app.\nIt's called iSH. Still in beta but I think you can get a Testflight invite right on the homepage. \nIt even has pseudo access to the Files app.\nFor instance, you can make a directory with mkdir, create a script with the terminal using any number of editors, and then open said script in the Files app like it were an iCloud text document in your TextEdit folder. \nBut, as far as I can tell, you can not move that script directly to Dropbox, or your TextEdit folder on iCloud.\nYou can, however, copy and share the text via the share extension.  \nAnyone else been screwing with this app?\nHere's the GitHub link to the project, and they've got a Twitter and reddit, too. \nA few screenshots of the app in action on an iPad with the Files app, and without:\n\n\n\n\nA: Not really. There isn’t any sort of ssh / bash shell functionality exposed by Apple on iOS 11 or older. \nJailbreak is the most direct path to getting generic shell access to iOS. \nI’ve taken to traveling with a small wifi router and raspberry pi / beaglebone so I can let iOS do iOS well and ssh over to a true Linux / Unix device when I need that local and not running in the cloud or a data center / back at home. \n", "Q: Are WhatsApp voice calls recorded on your device? I know voice calling on WhatsApp is logged but is it stored on the device in a way you can re listen to the conversation?  I looked in the WhatsApp folders and everything is there from voice notes, photos, videos, etc. and there is nothing there for voice calling.\nAre WhatsApp calls recorded and stored on the device or is it just a log where you can see you made a call?\n\nA: The audio of the calls is not recorded and is not available in the app container.\n", "Q: MacOS shutting down after password and loading screen, safe mode not working After entering password on login, the loader gets stuck 2/3rds in and shuts down.

So, I've been using Apple's Health app, and I think it's wonderful. \nMy Apple Watch frequent enters my heart rate and steps-taken into the database, and I can manually enter other common things like my blood pressure and weight. Cool. \nHowever, I don't see fields for everything that I may want to track. \nFor example, there aren't any fields to keep track of so-called 'healthy' fats, like DHAs / Omega-3 fatty acids. \nI know that there are 3rd party apps that keep track of this sort of thing. But they seem to store that data in their own internal databases. I haven't found an app that can write data to the Health database. That is, unless the field already exists. \nSo, that has led me to wonder: Is Apple the sole provider/decider of the fields that can be used in their Health app? \nOr, is it possible for 3rd party apps (or just a regular user like me) to create new fields that will work in the Health app? \n\nA: Neither you nor third-party developers can add fields to Health.\n\nWorking with the HealthKit Framework\nThe HealthKit framework is designed to share data between apps in a meaningful way. The framework constrains the types of data and units to a predefined list, ensuring that all apps understand what the data means and how it can be used. Developers cannot create custom data types or units. Instead, HealthKit provides a wide variety of data types and units.\n\nHealthKit | Apple Developer Documentation\n", "Q: Text replacement problem in Calendar I am using Yosemite 10.10.5.\nI am using a set of text replacement defined within:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Text\n\nas follows (partial view focused on interesting cases):\n\n.\nThe -> and => are working in TextEdit:\n\nBut within Calendar, -> is working and => is failing:\n\n.\nA test with a newly created account give the same abnormal behaviour.\n\nWhat may cause this inconsistent text replacement behaviour?\nHow may I further analyze or debug this inconsistent behaviour?\n\nA: I’ve experienced many issues using Text Replacements that start with certain symbols, like - = $ and many more (including punctuations). This even extends to replacements that start with numbers.\nThose replacements themselves may work, but having them saved might block others from working. Such failures may be limited to specific apps, as you’ve noticed.\nHere are my notes on what interacts with what…\nThe following prevent :) from triggering:\n\n\n*\n\n*...\n\n*--\n\n*-_-\n\n*->\n\n*$)\n\n*401k\n\n*8B\n\n*8o\nThe following prevent ;) from triggering:\n\n\n*\n\n*|(\n\n*|)\n\n*2d\n\n*3g\n\n*>)\n\n*>(\n\n*>=\nThe following didn’t work at all:\n\n\n*\n\n*1/2\n\n*1/3\n\n*etc.\n\n\nI've found that only using replacements that start with : ; ( ^ and letters makes the feature work very reliably.\nThis affects only macOS (up to and including Sierra 10.12.4). I haven't experienced issues with Text Replacements on iOS at all. However since they sync over iCloud I've had to remove all those “bad” strings.\nI arrived at this conclusion by painstakingly removing text substitutions and checking if non-working substitutions suddenly started working. Sure enough, each time I removed all those that started with a given character, an entire class of previously non-working ones started working.\nMy guess is that macOS treats different characters as word boundaries, and that different applications may use their own rules as well. That would break how substitution strings are detected across macOS apps. For instance on iOS you often need to add a space to trigger a replacement, even one that ends with a ). On macOS the substitution typically occurs immediately.\n", "Q: Wipe all WiFi settings from MacBook My old MacBook has come out of retirement after about two years turned off. It connected to my WiFi but the browsers complain it's insecure and might be connected to servers pretending to be the ones I'm entering. And my ISP's security features are warning me I'm not using their DNS (which explains the browser warnings too I guess).\nI've tried forgetting the network and logging back in, and deleting any DNS settings I can see in system settings, and re-setting DHCP->manual and back, and nothing works.\nDo I need to wipe all WiFi settings or is there something else? On ethernet it works fine (it's one of those antique MacBooks before Apple improved them by removing such things).\n\nA: IIRC, there is a pretty simple way to do this! The first set of instructions in this link explains it pretty well, but in case the link breaks, here is the text from the site. The idea is to delete the network configuration related plist files.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Turn off Wi-Fi from the menu bar.\n  \n*Navigate to /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/ in Finder by pressing ⌘ + Shift + G.\n  \n*Select the following files:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n  \n*com.apple.network.identification.plist\n  \n*com.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist\n  \n*NetworkInterfaces.plist\n  \n*preferences.plist\n  \n  \n*Copy these files in a safe location so that if anything gets messed up, you can easily restore them.\n  \n*Delete the files (from the original location).\n  \n*Reboot your Mac and enable Wi-Fi again.\n  \n\nLet me know how this goes!\nVia the command line:\ncd /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/\nsudo zip backup.zip \\\n         com.apple.airport.preferences.plist       \\\n         com.apple.network.identification.plist    \\\n         com.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist       \\\n         NetworkInterfaces.plist preferences.plist\nsudo rm  com.apple.airport.preferences.plist       \\\n         com.apple.network.identification.plist    \\\n         com.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist       \\\n         NetworkInterfaces.plist preferences.plist\n\nNote: In macOS Mojave 10.14.4, the file com.apple.network.identification.plist didn't exist on atleast 1 machine where this was tested.

From my research, the only way I see the ability to switch between tabs is by clicking them. \n\nA: If you enable All Controls in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts, then you can ⇥tab to the button and use space to select it. There does not seem to be a keyboard shortcut for toggling the option directly.\n\nA: On a US keyboard, you can use Command + Shift + [ and Command + Shift + ] to cycle among the tabs.\nHere's an overview of keyboard shortcuts for iTunes.\n", "Q: Is there a way to download or save voice recordings from messenger?

That way I could avoid overwriting existing ones, and I wouldn't have to test manually every shortcut I want to add. \n\nA: This isn't possible since the app doesn't store what shortcuts it may make available, as it can change the menus as it wishes or use a shortcut for something not available in a menu.\n\n\n*\n\n*When user shortcuts are added and the user presses the shortcut, macOS looks through the menus to find the menu item which matches the name you enter. This is a runtime check performed when the shortcut is actioned, since it's not possible to check prior to this. This is why the text which you enter for the menu item in System Preferences is a freeform box, since it's not possible to enumerate every menu item which could exist for an app.\n\n*Apps don't have to restrict shortcuts to items available in the menus. Apps can trigger on shortcuts without registering a companion menu item. This is the second reason the shortcuts can't be enumerated.\n", "Q: Why under /bin are there so many ‘Unix executable files’? Why under /bin are there so many Alias and Unix executable files? I thought executable files were files that Mac categorize as \"not used\" or along those lines?\n\nA: macOS is UNIX. macOS is POSIX-certified. /bin contains common binaries needed by macOS and is absolutely required for the correct functioning of the OS.\nI guess what you're confusing is how these files are represented in Finder. In Finder, the file type of binaries are shown as ‘Unix executable’. Executable files as you may know them are probably .exe for Windows, which are not something macOS can execute. They are still referred to as executable files, since just because macOS can't execute them doesn't mean there isn't something else that can.\n", "Q: Prevent iTerm2 from opening new terminal from dock I just switched from TotalTerminal to iTerm2, and the feature I used the most was the visor.

My parents own a 2013 Toyota RAV4 with a single USB port under the front dashboard.\n\nAny time I charge my iPhone or iPad using the car's USB port, my phone's audio immediately stops working. Apparently the iPhone thinks it's been docked and is trying to play sound through the car's speakers. There is no option to select any audio source other than the Dock Connector.\n\nI've seen this problem reported on forms once or twice before, but the only solutions seemed to be workarounds like \"use the cigarette lighter for charging\" or \"pair to the car's speakers using Bluetooth\".\nWhat can I do to prevent my iPhone from muting itself when plugged into a 2013 Toyota RAV4?\n\nA: Your phone isn't muting itself, it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do - trying to play music through the USB port. That's because the USB port on the RAV4 (along with many vehicles in recent years) is designed to be used for both audio playback and charging.\nI can't comment on the RAV4 specifically, but in most vehicles the input source will change as soon as you plug the phone into the USB port. So, preventing this behaviour involves only changing the car's input source back to whatever it was prior to connecting the USB cable.\nIf that's not happening in your case (some car audio systems don't seem to let go of the input, even though the source has changed), perhaps you can change the audio source on the iPhone. To do this, tap on the down arrow on the right of the Dock Connector label to see what other options you can pick (if any). Plugging in some headphones (assuming you're not using an iPhone 7) will provide that as an option to select.\nOtherwise, the assumption is that playing audio through the iPhone's built-in speakers is not required when it's plugged into a dock/external speaker (which is what the builtin USB port is on the RAV4). Your only option to play audio through the builtin speaker is to plug the iPhone into a secondary USB charger (e.g. using the accessory socket of your vehicle). \nYour next best option is to just plug in some headphones (although if you have an iPhone 7 you may need a special adapter so you can both charge and use the headphones simultaneously), or connect to Bluetooth headphones.\n[Edit]\nI was reminded via the comments that you can actually buy cables that are charging only cables. My brother-in-law accidentally bought one of those cables and he could never use it for anything other than charging. So, presumably, such a cable could solve your problem.\nIn my brother-in-law's case, he purchased his cable from a servo (i.e. a gas station). I mention this only because I'm not sure if that's where you're more likely to come across them.\n\nA: hit aux and if you have the screen display look closer (usually in the top right) it’ll say AUX if you hit it again it’ll change to iPod. that’s how i got mine to work. \nso hit aux find where you can see AUX in the corner cause it usually pops up for like 30 seconds then when you see the AUX come up hit the actually AUX button and it’ll change it to iPod which will relay the audio and charge! :) hope this helped cause i just figured this out for my car lol. \n\nA: I solved the problem with IPhone 7 Bluetooth streaming and charging at the same time in your car problem. Don't use the built-in USB connection in the car. Use a USB Car Charger Adapter. They are cheap, less than $10. Plug it into the 12V auxiliary power outlet/cigarette lighter. Then plug your USB to lighting cord into it. Worked like a champ on my 2016 Avalon.  \n\nA: All I had to do was unplug my headset and plug my headset back in (I did it by accident)\n", "Q: iPhone 7+ text message with no contact or text but location is on?

What would cause this? Thanks for the help!\n\n\n\n\n \n\nA: This could be a corrupted Messages database. If you have your texts set to expire after a certain amount of time (under Settings → Messages → Keep Messages), your message threads would normally get emptied out, although the number would remain at the top.\nYou can find out for certain whether you’re sharing your location with anybody by going into Settings → Personal Profile (at the very top) → iCloud → Share My Location. If the list there is empty you should be fine, though you might still want to Stop Sharing My Location to see if an error/change occurs.\nThe Personal Profile submenu exists in iOS 10.3 and later.

Some of them only exist for a few days. And new ec2s get created frequently.\nI use iTerm2 as my macOS terminal. And I couldn't find any plugin that does the thing I want.\nOr is there a better ssh management tool that can display custom text on the title of an ssh connection?\n\nA: The best way (IMO) is to set the necessary variables in your bash_profile of your remote machine.  I understand you don't want to modify anything on your remote but it's important to note that what you are doing is setting the environment variable PROMPT_COMMAND\nWhen logged in to your remote, issue the command echo $HOSTNAME and echo $PROMPT_COMMAND.  More than likely, you will get the hostname of your machine and the second will come up blank meaning that it's unset.\nSetting the Title\nEdit your .bash_profile found in your home directory on the remote. This is your file and will not affect the rest of the system.  Add the following line:\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\033]0;${HOSTNAME}\\007\"'\n\nThe \\033]0; (Esc 0;) is the escape code to set the title.  The ${HOSTNAME} is the name of your machine.\nSave your profile, log out and log back in and your title bar should now reflect your hostname.\nConnecting via hostname vs IP\nThere are two ways to do this:\n\n*\n\n*Set the hostname in DNS\n\n*modify your local /etc/hosts file\n\nI prefer to set this in DNS so that the name will be available to all computers across your network.  Going under the assumption that you have a \"consumer grade\" router (like Linksys or Netgear), you just have to add the hostname to your DHCP static lease (see your router documentation for specifics)\nIf you're on a corporate network, the Network Admin can add a record to the DNS server pointing to your host.\nIf those two options aren't available, you can simply edit your local /etc/hosts file (need root permissions.  Below is my /etc/hosts used as an example:\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n::1             localhost\n192.168.10.22   fatjoe\n\nI added the hostname fatjoe to the end of the hosts file.  When I save and exit, if I type ping fatjoe it immediately begins to ping the correct IP - the change is immediate.\n\nA: Add the following to your ~/.ssh/config:\nHost yourname\n    HostName server.example.com\n    Port 22\n    User root\n\nThen use ssh yourname and ‘yourname’ will be shown in the title bar.\n\nA: I followed all the answer of this post and the official guide, but without success.\nChecking up further, I discovered the ~/.bashrc on the target machine was overwriting $PS1, and thus putting back the default name.\nIf you have the same problem, it might be worth looking for those lines in ~/.bashrc and edit them as to show the title you want ($NICKNAME in my case) to appear on the terminal tab.\n case \"$TERM\" in\n xterm*|rxvt*)\n     PS1=\"\\[\\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}$NICKNAME: \\w\\a\\]$PS1\"\n     ;;\n *)\n     ;;\n esac```\n\n", "Q: How do I create a Windows-like Start Menu for the macOS Dock without 3rd party software? I am very new to Mac (only 1.5 weeks) and am trying to get used to its different way of doing things. Most of what I loved in Windows I've also found the macOS way of doing. \nI am now more familiar with the Apple Menu and the Dock, and am getting used to the Finder. But I really do miss the Windows Start Menu.\nI read this question  and have checked out uBar but it really seems overkill for my requirements and paying $20 for all the extras doesn’t appeal.\nMy requirements are simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*I just want easy access from a single item in the Dock menu to a whole heap of apps that are organised into logical groups. For example, I want any games listed in a Games subfolder, utilities in a Utilities subfolder, office apps in a Office subfolder and so on. \n\n*If possible, it’d be a bonus if I could have recent items accessible from the same menu, and also be able to shutdown or put my Mac to sleep from this menu. \n\n\nIs there any way to achieve what I want without the need for external applications?\n\nA: You can add arbitrary folders to your Dock and these folders can contain other folders as well as aliases to apps in the /Applications folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder such as ~/Applications (macOS will automatically give the folder an icon if you use this location).\n\n*Add folders inside for the categories you wish.\n\n*Inside these folders, add aliases to the apps you wish.\nTo create an alias, right-click on the app and choose Make Alias.\n\n*Add this folder to your Dock by dragging the folder from Finder to the right side of the Dock separator line.\n\n*Right-click on the folder in your Dock and choose:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sort By: Name\n\n*Display As: Folder\n\n*View Content As: Grid\n\n\n\nEditing the contents of this folder will automatically update the contents of the folder in the Dock, so you don't need to remove it and add it when you make changes.\n\n\nTo add a Recent Applications stack to your Dock, run the following in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add \\\n  '{ \"tile-data\" = { \"list-type\" = 1; }; \"tile-type\" = \"recents-tile\"; }' && killall Dock\n\n\nTo perform other actions from this menu, create an Automator application to shut down and add it to your folder.\n\nThe AppleScript in the screenshot is as follows:\ntell application \"System Events\" to shut down\n\nTo sleep instead of shut down, replace ‘shut down’ with ‘sleep’. You can create many Automator applications to perform different actions.\n\nA: Yes, this is largely possible within macOS. Some of it is very straightforward, while some of it requires a bit more effort.\nCreate a ’Start Menu’ folder for the Dock\nFollow these steps to create what you’ll need to start with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you’re in the Finder\n\n*Navigate to a location you’d like to keep your Start Menu (e.g. in your user’s home folder, your Documents folder, etc)\n\n*Now got to File > New Folder (or just use the shift command N) shortcut to create a new folder called Start Menu\n\n*Now within the Start Menu folder you just created,  create three new folders and name them Games, Utilities and Office.\n\n*Now navigate to wherever you have your games saved (most likely within your Applications folder)\n\n*Now right-click on a game and select the Make Alias option\n\n*This will create an alias in the same location (an alias is the same as a shortcut in Windows)\n\n*Now drag that alias into the Games folder you created at Step 4\n\n*Repeat Steps 6 to 8 for any other games you want in your Games list\n\n*Now repeat the same overall process from Steps 5 to 9 for items you want in your Office folder and Utilities folder. Note: In the case of Utilities, if you plan to add any utilities located within the default Applications > Utilities folder, you will be prompted to enter your password when creating the alias and again when moving it the Utilities folder you created at Step 4.\n\n*Once you’re finished, drag the Start Menu folder to the right-hand side of the Dock (it must be to the right of the vertical divider)\n\n*Now right-click on the folder you just added to the Dock and select Kind for sort by\n\n*Now right-click on the folder again and select Folder for display as\n\n*Right-click on the folder again and select List for view content as\n\n\nThat’s it in terms of your basic requirements. \nAdd ‘Recent Items’ to your Start Menu\nTo start with I’ll provide steps for having a way to access recent items from the same Start Menu (as per your preferred requirements). However, be sure to read my note at the end of this part of my answer for what I believe to be a better solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you’re in the Finder\n\n*Now go to File > New Smart Folder\n\n*The New Smart Folder window will appear\n\n*Click on the + button near top right of this window (it’s below the Search field)\n\n*From the leftmost drop-down list select the Last opened date option\n\n*From the middle drop-down list select the within last option\n\n*From the rightmost drop-down list select the days option\n\n*Now enter a value in the field before the days option to indicate how many days (e.g. if you enter ‘5’ in here, this will display anything that’s been opened in the past 5 days)\n\n*Now click on the + button again (the same one you did at Step 4)\n\n*From the leftmost drop-down list select the Kind option\n\n*From the rightmost drop-down list select the Any option\n\n*Now click on the Save button (it’s to the left of the +  button)\n\n*In the Save As: field give this the name Recent Items\n\n*Now navigate to the Start Menu you create above\n\n*Click on the Save button at bottom right\n\n*Now select Recent Items from your Start Menu\n\n*In the window that opens, set your view options within Finder for how you best want this to appear in future (e.g. as a list, etc)\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could use the above process to create multiple Recent options (e.g. you could create a Recent Applications option by selecting Application as the Kind in Step 11.\n\n*macOS provides a builtin Recent Items option for the Dock that will work a lot better than what we’re customising above, but this will be a separate item in the dock, not part of the Start Menu folder you created. To do this, launch Terminal (it’s found in within the default Utilities folder) and then type (or copy and paste) the following: defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add '{\"tile-data\" = {\"list-type\" = 1;}; \"tile-type\" = \"recents-tile\";}'; killall Dock . It may take a little while, but you’ll soon notice the Dock disappear and then reappear. Once it does, you’ll have a new item in the dock to the left of the Trash can. Clicking on this will show recent applications, but you can also right-click on it to set options such as what to show and how to show them.\n\n\nAdd ‘Shut Down’ to your Start Menu\nThis is not too hard to do, but it will require you to create an AppleScript application to save within the Start Menu folder you created earlier.\nFor example, you could do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Script Editor (by default it’s in Applications > Utilities)\n\n*Use command N to create a new document\n\n*Copy and paste the followed code into your script window:\n\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to click menu item \"Shut Down…\" of menu 1 ¬\n    of menu bar item \"Apple\" of menu bar 1 of process \"Finder”\n\n\n*Now go to File > Save…\n\n*In the Save As: field give this the name Shut Down\n\n*In the File Format drop-down list choose the Application option\n\n*Navigate to the Start Menu folder you created\n\n*Click on the Save button at bottom right\n\n*Now go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on Security & Privacy\n\n*Select the Privacy tab\n\n*Select Accessibility from the lefthand pane\n\n*Unlock the padlock at bottom left (you’ll need to enter your password)\n\n*Select the checkbox for the Script Editor app\n\n*Now click on the + sign and navigate to the Shut Down app (remember you saved it within the Start Menu folder) to add it to the list of apps\n\n*Select the checkbox for the Shut Down app\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n*Click on your Start Menu within the Dock and select Shut Down\n\n\nNOTE: At Step 14 if the Script Editor app is not listed as an option, then use the same process from Step 15 to add it. Remember that it’s located within the Applications > Utilities folder.\nAdd ‘Sleep’ to your Start Menu\nThis is basically the same process as adding the Shut Down option in that it requires you to create an AppleScript application to save within the Start Menu folder you created earlier.\nFollow as per the Shutdown steps above, except note the following differences:\n\n\n*\n\n*At Step 3 - copy and paste the following code instead: tell application \"Finder\" to sleep\n\n*At Step 5 - save it as Sleep\n\n*Skip Step 14\n\n*At Step 15 - add the Sleep app instead of the Shutdown app \n\n*At Step 16 - Select the checkbox for the Sleep app\n\n\nNow you'll have the Sleep option as well.\nI know there’s an awful lot to this answer, so please post a comment if you get stuck or have any questions. \n\nA: I think the closest built-in functionality on a Mac to the start menu of a Windows PC is the launchpad. Info on how to use launchpad is copied below. However I would recommend getting used to using Spotlight which is the search functionality on a Mac (can be accessed by clicking on the magnifying glass on the top right of the screen, or by using the keyboard shortcut Cmd+Spacebar). This is the fastest way to access any app or document you're looking for, and makes the functionality of a \"Start-menu\" obsolete.\n\nEntering Launchpad.\n  To open Launchpad and quickly access your apps:\n  Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock\n\n\n\nOR Press the launchpad key on your keyboard if present \n\n\n\nOR Pinch together your thumb-and-three-fingers in gesture on your trackpad.\n\n\n\nNavigating Launchpad.\n  When you enter Launchpad, OS X shows you all of your apps. To open an app, simply click its icon.\n\n\n\nBy default, items in Launchpad are in alphabetical order. You can re-arrange icons on Launchpad by dragging them in the order you want.\n  If there's not enough room to show all of your apps on one screen, Launchpad creates multiple pages. The dots at the bottom of the Launchpad screen show you how many pages of apps there are, and which page you are currently viewing.\nTo move between pages:\n  Press the right or left arrow on your keyboard.\n  Click a dot at the bottom of the Launchpad screen.\n  Swipe left or right with two fingers on your trackpad.\nIn OS X Mountain Lion and later, you can also search for an app by entering its name in the search field at the top of the Launchpad window.\nLaunchpad folders. You can organize your apps into categories in Launchpad. Just drag and drop one icon onto another. \n\n \n\nTo see the contents of the folder in Launchpad, just click it. The other icons move out of the way so you can see the apps in the folder. You can also rename the folder by clicking its name in this view. You can also move items from a folder, back to the main Launchpad screen. Simply drag an icon out of the Launchpad folder and let go. If you remove all of the icons from a Launchpad folder, the folder goes away automatically.\nLeaving Launchpad.\nTo exit Launchpad, open an app. If you want to exit without opening anything:\n  Press the Escape (esc) key or Launchpad key on your keyboard.\n  Click the Launchpad icon, or another app icon in the Dock.\n  Use the Application Switcher or Mission Control to select another app.\n  Pinch outward using your thumb and three fingers on your trackpad. \nLaunchpad and Mac App Store. When you purchase an app from the Mac App Store, it automatically appears in launchpad. If you later want to uninstall an app that you purchased, you can remove it from your Mac using Launchpad.\n  First, click and hold your pointer on an icon in Launchpad until all of the icons on your screen start to wiggle. Or, press the Option key on your keyboard.\n  Click the remove button (X) in the upper left of the icon of the app you want to remove.\nNote: If there is no \"X\" icon, the app wasn't installed from the Mac App Store, or the app is included as part of OS X. Check the documentation that came with the app for more information. Click Delete to confirm you want to remove the app.\nTip: You can use the Mac App Store to install the app again if you want it back.\n\n", "Q: How can I abort a calculation that is hanging in Numbers for Mac?

The timeline may also include local snapshots.\n\n*Use the onscreen up and down arrows to jump to the last time the contents of the window changed. You can also use the search field in a window to find a file, then move through time while focused on changes to that file.\n\n*Select a file and press Space Bar to preview the file and make sure it's the one you want. \n\n\n*Click Restore to restore the selected file, or Control-click the file for other options.\n\n\nThis should get you back to before you made the errant formula.

FreeNAS is based on FreeBSD, so I assumed it would play nice with Mac Pro, but it really doesn't as it relates to boot devices.\nFreeNAS will only boot IF you trick Boot Camp Assistant to think FreeNAS is Windows and when it prompts you to install Windows, you switch the disk on boot-up and install FreeNAS instead.\nLastly, FreeNAS will only boot if you have a SATA drive connected to one of the 6 built-in SATA channels on the Mac Pro. It will NOT boot if you have a PCIe card with a SATA SSD mounted on it.\nIf you do everything right and get FreeNAS to boot from one of the built-in SATA channels, if you hold down Option while booting, no boot disks are shown. \nMy concern is although Mac Pro is happy to boot into FreeNAS today, if it stops booting for some reason, how do I tell Mac Pro to boot from a disk that doesn't show up in boot drive screen?\n(Note: FreeNAS has the option to mirror boot drives, so if one fails, in a normal PC hardware situation you can just point to the mirrored drive for boot. I'd like to use this technique as well for my Mac Pro FreeNAS, but since Mac doesn't recognize FreeNAS as a bootable device unless you trick it via Boot Camp Assistant, I don't see this as a viable option, unless someone knows how do it otherwise.)\n\nA: You may want to try a different boot loader than BootCamp. Personally I've used http://refit.sourceforge.net/screen.html and http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/ (a fork of refit) to boot various linux flavors on my old Macbook Pro. They're relatively simple to setup (for a boot loader).\n", "Q: How to you get the \"Share with Google Drive\" contextual menu option in Finder? Google Drive is installed but there is no option \"View with Google Drive\" or \"Share with Google Drive\" when I Control-click / Right-click on an item in the Finder like my coworkers have. How do you enable them? \n\nA: You need to enable the Finder extension Google Drive. \nOpen the contextual menu for any file, and click on Share and then More. \n\nThat will bring you to the Extensions window. \nClick on Finder and in the \"Select extensions for customizing Finder\" select Google Drive. \n\nNow you should see the \"View in Google Drive\" and \"Share with Google Drive\" options when you Control-click / secondary click on files inside your Google Drive.\n\n\nA: I also find that I need to occasionally uncheck, save, then recheck the checkbox \"Show file sync status icons and right-click menu\".

Despite of that I could test that on MacOS 10.13.6 (the well-know High Sierra). On High Sierra, after you get in Extensions settings, you'll not be able to find Google Drive.\nA solution is simply open your Backup and Synch app, relaunch the Finder (ALT + right click on Finder then press \"relaunch\"). After that, you'll be able to see sharing Google Drive options after right clicking on any folder/file in Finder.\nCheers.\n", "Q: How do I force Time Machine to back up to a USB HDD, instead of a .sparsebundle on that USB HDD? I use an iMac as an external monitor for my MacBook pro (OS X 11.6), over a thunderbolt cable. I usually have a USB 3 hard drive attached to my MacBook pro as a Time Machine backup. Last week I thought I would try attaching my USB drive to my iMac, and mounting it as a shared network drive over the thunderbolt network bridge. Of course, Time Machine then created a .sparsebundle disk image to perform the backup over the network. I decided I didn't want to start a full backup from scratch, and so moved the USB drive back to a direct connection.\nHowever, now Time Machine only wants to back up to the .sparsebundle image, even thought the drive is connected locally and has a full set of backups at the root of the drive (in Backups.backupd). I tried using tmutil setdestination and tmutil associateddisk -a to force the association, with no success. I even renamed the .sparsebundle, and every time I start a backup the .sparsebundle is renamed back to the old name.\nHow can I stop Time Machine from treating the USB-attached hard drive as a network share for backups?\n\nA: In order to prevent Time Machine from continuing to use the created .sparsebundle for its backups, you need to delete it.\nTime Machine tries to backup to .sparsebundle files first. If it can't find any, it will create regular local backup.\n\nA: What you want isn't really how it works.  See, .sparsebundle files are basically treated as though they're a separate disk.  So the OS/Time Machine basically sees the sparsebundle as essentially being a separate disk from the disk it's actually on - \"moving\" from one to the other isn't a simple task, and certainly couldn't be done reliably by you unless you had deep intricate knowledge of how Time Machine works, and probably you'd need some UNIX skills as well.  Your best bet is to probably just turn Time Machine off, delete the sparsebundle file on the disk, turn Time Machine back on and let it re-create the backups for you.\n", "Q: Excel 2011 crashes when printing certain worksheets Excel 2011 (for Mac) consistently crashes on certain .xlsx files, at the moment I want to print it (either directly to the printer or to PDF). With Excel 2016 (both Windows and Mac), it works fine.\nThe only thing I know, the Excel is created by a colleague who uses Excel for Windows.\n\nA: The Excel-worksheet probably contains an embedded OLE object. Within Excel you can check this by right clicking each \"image\". When the context-menu's last option is Format object, you found it.\nTo fix it, choose the option Save as image and choose a location and name. Then delete the object, and insert the previously saved image.\n\nThere is also another way to check for embedded objects. An .xlsx file is actually also a .zip file. You can rename the extension so you can unzip it (or use unzip filename.xlsx -d directory_to_unzip_to on the command line).\nWhen the newly created folder contains a folder xl/embeddings, and this folder contains at least one file, the excel contains an embedded object. \n", "Q: Keyboard button backtick/tilde become section symbol after replacement I have a MacBook Pro (mid-2012) with a US keyboard layout, but after a keyboard replacement I noticed my backtick/tilde key is now a section § symbol. \nAfter some googling, I found the Karabiner app. Yes it can remap the button but I felt that my OS (Sierra) became very slow, and I don’t want to rely on an app just for remap a single key.\nHas anyone experienced this issue before? I think maybe the technician installed a different kind of keyboard (maybe a UK one) instead of US.\nNote: I’ve called the service center and they will get back to me next week.\n\nA: If you now have an extra key to the left of the Z, that is where you should find backtick/tilde.\n(British and English International keyboards have this extra key and move those characters to it)\nIf you want things back where they were, a custom layout can easily be made with this app.\nIf you do not have the extra key, then you have the keyboard type being recognized incorrectly by the machine, which is another problem. But you can still fix it with a custom layout.\n\nA: for me it was a matter of configuring the keyboard through Settings -> Keyboard and then \"recognising\" again \"unrecognised keyboard\" (i.e., my plain keyboard which was plugged in all the time) and then setting its type to US (ANSI) instead of European (ISO).\n\nA: The UK keyboard does have a § key where the ~ should be.\n\nThis probably means they selected the wrong layout (for whatever reason). If you do have a US Layout keyboard, just go into System Preferences and select the correct one for your keyboard:\nIf it doesn't show up, click the \"plus\" button and add in the US keyboard layout.\n\n", "Q: How can I transfer a Live Photo from one .photoslibrary file to another? While on vacation, I imported my photos to my girlfriend’s laptop to free up space on my iPhone. She now has my Live Photos saved onto her laptop and I can view them when I open her Photos Library (.photoslibrary file). \nNow that we are home, I’d like to transfer these Live Photos from her laptop (MacBook Pro) to my desktop computer (iMac) where all my photos are stored.\nWhen I try to export the files on her computer, I get both a .jpg and a .mov file. I cannot import these to my Photos Library on my iMac as it will import them as a separate photo and video, not as a Live Photo.\nIs there any way to transfer a Live Photo from one Photos Library to another?\n\nA: The easiest way to transfer Live Photos is to use AirDrop.\nStarting with macOS Sierra 10.12.3, Apple added a new Live Photos Smart Album to Photos. It can be accessed either from the Sidebar (⌘ cmd ⌥ opt s) or in Albums view (⌘ cmd 4).\nOnce you’re in there, select all the Live Photos you want to transfer, then right-click, Share → AirDrop.\nTo use AirDrop, you will need one of the following models of Macs:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Late 2008) or later, excluding the MacBook Pro (17-inch, Late 2008)\n\n*MacBook Air (Late 2010) or later\n\n*MacBook (Late 2008) or later, excluding the white MacBook (Late 2008)\n\n*iMac (Early 2009) or later\n\n*Mac Mini (Mid 2010) or later\n\n*Mac Pro (Early 2009 with AirPort Extreme card, or Mid 2010)\n\n\nApple has a support article that may help you identify which model Macs you have.\nIf your Mac doesn’t support AirDrop, but hers does, AND you’ve managed to free up space on your iPhone, she can also AirDrop those photos to your iPhone. You can then import them into your Mac by plugging in to USB.\nBarring all of the above, then you can have your girlfriend send you those Live Photos by iMessage, then import them into your Photos Library.\nAs of macOS Sierra 10.12.4 and iOS 10.3.2, AirDrop and iMessage are the only built-in ways to share Live Photos while preserving their full quality. Using a Shared Photo Album will down-sample your photos to 2048 pixels on the long edge.\n\nA: I bought a 3rd part app called PowerPhotos from Fatcat SW.  Does a good job of moving photos between photoslibraries, but they don't (yet) support Live Photos.  Hope they decide to step up and do that support.  Makes it much simpler to move photos between libraries.\n", "Q: How to use BetterTouchTool to show Mail.app unread count in touch bar I have a MacBook Pro with a touch bar and have never used BetterTouchTool. I know it has touch bar functionality, like adding a button to open an app. Is it possible to show either of the following?\n\n\n*\n\n*The Mail.app icon (with unread email count)\n\n*Just the number of unread emails\n\n\nIf so, how can it be accomplished?\n\nA: BetterTouchTool has a \"widget\" option for the touch bar, and one of the options is to display the output of an AppleScript program. You could write a script that gets the number of unread emails (another question has some code for doing that here)\n\n", "Q: One Apple ID, two devices purchased in different locations. How to manage address on both devices? I am using a single Apple ID on two devices (iPhone 5s purchased in India, and iPad purchased in the US). How can I manage my address on each device?\nAlso, if I update the address to my Indian address, will it be fine with my current card details?\nThanks & regards.\n\nA: Your address in your iCloud account is not required to be in the same country where you purchased an iOS device. Enter the address where you live into your iCloud account.\nIf you happen to live in India but have your credit card registered in the US, enter your India address as your shipping address, but your US address as your billing address. However, many credit card companies will require some kind of confirmation from you if you ship to an address that isn’t your billing address.\n\nA: Apple Devices do not matter where they are purchased. Any Apple ID can be linked onto it. You can set the \"Apple ID\" region to whichever region you are currently residing in with the Card information. There will be no conflicts on your device if you use an US Apple ID.\nTo answer the question, You can update it to Indian Address. Just make sure you have an Indian Credit Card that can be added to your Apple ID.\n\nA: As I found out, having moved from one to another country, the country where the credit card is issued in will determine which country's iTunes store you can buy apps or movies or books from. \nIf you switched stores, you need a valid billing address and credit card from the country you're switching to. You won't be able to download apps, movies or books if they are not available in the new country's store. \nFor example, there will be apps only available in the India app store but not in the US store and vice versa. You would need to download them first before switching to ensure you'll be able to keep using them. \nBefore switching country /region in iTunes, you will need to cancel any active iTunes Match subscription. You can switch stores back as long as you have a valid billing address and credit card, and then you will be able to have access again to your purchased apps, movies or books. All other purchases are not transferable.\n", "Q: Hide all notifications when screen sharing I'd like to never show ANY notifications if I'm currently screen sharing to prevent those awkward moments where I forget to disable them manually and run the risk of someone IM'ing me something inappropriate. Notifications should be automatically disabled when I start screen sharing and automatically re-enabled when I stop. \nIs this possible at all? Even if it requires some development? \n\nA: You didn't mention the OS you're using so for this answer I'm using 10.12.5.\nSource.\nYou can option+click on the 3 lines for Notification Center in the menu bar:\nThis will silence any notifications that use the Apple system for notifications.  To put notifications back to normal, option+click again.\nThis doesn't silence any notifications that don't use Apple's system.  To silence those, you'll need to turn them off at the application-level.\n\nA: You can use Muzzleapp for this. It silences all notifications as you turn on screen sharing. Download it from the official website: https://muzzleapp.com/\n", "Q: Music starts automatically when headphones are plugged into the iPhone I have an iPhone 5 with the last version of iOS, 10.3.2. When I plug in the headphones into the jack, the music application starts automatically on the screen block, and starting to play music. I have no open application in the background when this happens.\nWhat are the reason and can be solved?\n\nA: Most normal headphones don't do this but some might or might not start playing. Try pausing your music before you unplug. That should work as a temporary fix.\n", "Q: SSH passphrase dialog missing I switched from an El Capitan machine to a new MacBook Air with Sierra.\nWith El Capitan, when I ssh into an host from terminal, the SSH passphrase GUI dialog showed up, and then it never asked again the passphrase for the whole login session.\nNow with Sierra the dialog is not showing up, I recurred to adding the following lines to .bashrc:\neval $(ssh-agent)\nssh-add\n\nbut the drawback is that every new terminal asks for the passphrase.\nHow to diagnose the missing dialog?\n\nA: Instead of ssh-add, use\nssh-add -A\n\nThis uses the Keychain to find the passphrase, and since your Keychain should be unlocked because you're logged in, you won't be prompted.\n(Sierra drastically changed how ssh keys are handled by the OS. The dialog is no more.)\n", "Q: How to access Safari 7.0.6 with Sierra 10.12.1 OS 2013 MacBook Pro logic board died. Removed HD and connected to Desk Mac, can access everything but Safari, want to get bookmarks, says \"7.0.6 not supported\". Can anyone suggest procedure?\n\nA: In Safari 10, bookmarks are stored in ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist. I'm assuming they were stored the same way in v.7\nYou can open the file as text in BBEdit or TextWrangler, or use some sort of XML editor and extract the bookmarks from there.\nThe file doesn't neatly list the bookmarks for easy viewing. The bookmarks are embedded in xml code and will need to be extracted. Fortunately, the bookmark URL is just a text string.

However, Boot Camp sees the SSD as an external device and doesn't allow it.\nI've read that some users have used the Apricorn Velocity Solo with some success but others have reported the same problem with this card as well. I have this card on order and will be testing it too. More on this to come.\nI can install an OS (in my case, FreeNAS, based on FreeBSD) on a SSD while connected to built in SATA channel, then move it to a PCIe adapter, but it won't boot. It only boots if connected to one of the 6 built-in SATA channels.\nIs is possible to get an SSD to show up as an internal device with ANY PCIe card? If so, do you know of a list of cards that do work?\n\nA: Apparently it is not possible to have neither a PCIe flash nor PCIe-attached SSD drive show up as internal on a Mac Pro. I tried multiple PCIe flash and PCIe SATA cards and none showed as internal, even those claiming to be bootable on Mac.\nOn a side note, even though I could not get FreeNAS (FreeBSD based NAS software) to boot from a PCIe add-on card, I was able to install Windows 8.1 on a PCIe flash drive and it shows up in the boot menu when holding down the Option key as EFI.\n", "Q: Why are some fonts listed with ls shown in red and with a star at the end of the filename? I am trying to use some fonts in ImageMagick which are not showing up, despite me using the same script that works on another Mac. Listing the fonts in /Library/Fonts I can see that the missing fonts are listed differently when I use the ls -lahFG command.\nWhat does this way of listing files mean?\n\n\nA: It means the font files are marked as executable, i.e. they contain code which can be executed. This is clearly incorrect for what should be a font file with no concept of being executed.\n", "Q: How to remove preinstalled iOS apps? I have an iPhone 7 and I save all my work projects on it. On my iPhone I don't have any pictures or games but the memory is getting full and I'd like to free it. On my iPhone there are some preinstalled iOS apps that I don't use and they fill the memory. I would like to delete them but I don't know how to do that. How can I remove preinstalled iOS apps to get a faster system? Can I remove these apps or only the folders?\n\nA: You can delete preinstalled iOS apps by holding down on the app icon until they wiggle, then choosing the × button. However, note that this will not free any space on your device as the apps are part of iOS and their files are not removed from your device. Removing any apps, regardless of whether they are part of the OS or not will not increase the speed of your device.\nYou can determine what is taking space on your device in Settings → General → Storage & iCloud Usage → Storage: Manage Storage.\n", "Q: Is it normal for the iMac 5K's GPU to be at 90℃ with fan on constantly? I have found that the GPU die on my iMac is around 90℃ and the fan is kicking in all the time. Is this normal? If not, how should I fix it?\nI have iMac 27″ Retina 5K (late 2014) with AMD Radeon R9 M295X 4096 MB, and I have Dell UltraSharp U2715H 27-inch LED-Lit monitor connected to the iMac.\n\nA: Powering that many pixels will be a stretch. You're powering a 5K display internally to your iMac and a 2560×1440 external display. Having your GPU at 90℃ is standard for powering that many pixels.\nIf you don't wish for the GPU to be that hot, disconnect the external display. It's still well within the thermal limits of the GPU, so I don't think it's something to worry about particularly. Apple always seem to run components hot for the sake of keeping the fans quiet, but you can override the fan speed to cool the GPU further using an app like iStat Menus.\nThere's a nice discussion about that GPU in the 5K iMac over at MacRumors forum:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD Radeon R9 M295X Core Clock Throttling, Heat, and Performance (page 34)\n\nA: This is probably NOT normal (I'm disagreeing here with the answer provided by user grg). I own the same iMac configuration you are asking about (late 2014 iMac 5k R9 M295x graphics card, 4GB vRAM). In addition to running the built in display at a higher 'scaled' resolution (2880x1620)—which Apple warns \"may affect performance\"—, I also have attached a 2560×1440 external display and a 3840x2160 external display. So it seems on that count I'm taxing my GPU harder than you are. But my GPU die temp (measured via iStat Menus) is generally around 75 degrees C, with my fan usually around a silent 1200 rpm (which seems to be its base rate). \nMy usual computer use involves web browsing, email, Microsoft Office, Slack, Zoom video conferencing, note-taking apps, etc. So not anything too intense from a GPU perspective (other than the fact that I have LOTS of windows open spread across 12 desktops in Mission Control, which does tax the vRAM). It will occasionally get above 90C when I'm doing something graphics intensive (such as zooming around a lot in Google Maps satellite view), but quickly drops down in temperature once that activity is over. \nIf you are doing something graphically intensive on a regular, ongoing basis (such as watching videos non-stop), that could cause your GPU die temperature to stay around 90C, but it would have to be pretty sustained for the temperature to remain there, as macOS seems to want to keep the GPU temperature below that point, and aggressively ramps up the fan speed when those temperatures are encountered, to try and get the GPU a bit cooler.\nAlso, if you are in an unusually hot room (and/or have sunlight directly on the iMAC or a heater located near it), that of course can affect the thermal situation.\nI'd look to see if certain apps or webpages you might have open could be somehow 'secretly' driving GPU usage and temperatures. Try closing them one by one and seeing if that makes a difference. For instance, it could be that you have webpages open on sites with bitcoin miners, which will tax your GPU. There are browser plug-ins which will block miners, too. When doing this kind of troubleshooting, I find that looking at the \"GPU package\" power consumption (in Watts) using an app like iStat Menus (also mentioned by grg) is most useful, as it response most quickly to a change in GPU load, before that change is reflected in die temperature. For reference, my GPU package power use hovers around 40W–44W under typical usage (with spikes to around 60W when the GPU is being severely taxed).\n\nA: It is not that abnormal for iMac GPUs to get hot easily, unfortunately. Make sure to clean the GPU heatpipe every few years (like 3 or so), even if you're not running in a dusty environment you'll be surprised how much dust accumulates there. You can find instructions on how to open your iMac e.g. on youtube or tell your dealer to open and clean it internally.\nIf you are running 3D applications, think about limiting the frame rate and lowering the quality.\n", "Q: Saved a file in the wrong location and I cannot retrieve it I was using ssh-keygen which at some point asked me where I wanted my public key and my identification saved.

Can I find out what happened and delete those files? I could not find them with ls -la \\. Actually it starts some type of prompt. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: You need to use two back slashes. In the terminal using the bash shell (which it is by default) the backslash character tells bash to allow you to continue typing commands on a new line (hence the prompt you saw).\nSo if you do ls -la \\\\ that should show you the contents of \"\\\"\nLikewise mv \\\\ fixed should rename the folder to \"fixed\"\n\nA: You have to enable hidden files to find it then you can search it in spotlight\n", "Q: \"mkdir: /Users/me/.bash_sessions: Operation not permitted\" When I open Terminal, I get the following error\nmkdir: /Users/me/.bash_sessions: Operation not permitted\n\nAny idea why that may be the case?  Is there a solution?\n\nA: More than likely the error message is produced by the file- /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal in the last line of this snippet:\n# Set up the session directory/file.\nSHELL_SESSION_DIR=\"$HOME/.bash_sessions\"\nSHELL_SESSION_FILE=\"$SHELL_SESSION_DIR/$TERM_SESSION_ID.session\"\nmkdir -m 700 -p \"$SHELL_SESSION_DIR\"\n\nOperation not permitted would suggest some kind of a file lock. Edit your post with the following command and its output:\n ls -lOed $HOME\n\n\nA: It's likely that there's something in your profile which is incorrect. Check the contents of your shell's profile, such as ~/.bash_profile.

What is the reason and can be solved?\n\nA: Crash logs are automatically reported to developers. So there is no need to do it manually. \nTo prevent crashing you could try any of Crash Recovery options from iOS system settings:\n\n\n\nAnother problem may be due to you using old iOS version. See Brian's answer for another question here.\nPulled from this post\n", "Q: How to connect to Microsoft Windows machine using host name only via Microsoft Remote Desktop I'm using Microsoft Remote Desktop to connect to a Windows 7 laptop. Sometimes it will connect using the laptop's NETBIOS name. Other times it will only connect using the IP address of the laptop.\nI'm doing this on my home office network. I have a macOS Sierra on the network and I assume I have to enable WINS or something like that.\nHow can I always connect to my Windows computers from my Mac using Microsoft Remote Desktop by specifying the host name only, and not having to specify the IP address?\n\nA: Your best bet is to set up a static DHCP lease in your router and specify the host name.\nSince you are using a home network, I am going under the assumption you are using a consumer grade \"router\" to connect to the Internet.  It's also your DHCP server, your DNS server (repeater), and your WiFi access point.\nSomewhere in your router's setup, there is an option for static DHCP leases.  What you do is take the MAC address of your Windows machine, pick an IP address (I like to go outside the pool) and make an entry for a lease.  You can enter a hostname here as well.\nThe static lease means your device still get's its IP via DHCP, but the DHCP server will always hand out the same IP when requested.  Once you do that, it will cache the DNS host name.  So, from any computer on your home network, you will be able to connect to it.\n", "Q: UE Boom 2 stutters with MacBook Pro when using browser My UE Boom 2 stutters when using it with a web browser on my MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra. I can play Spotify fine if I just have it up front but if I push it to the background and try to browse the web, it starts stuttering. I can't play anything from the web either since it stutters from the start. My iPhone plays on the bluetooth speaker just fine but it's my MacBook that's having the problem. Has anyone else had this issue?\n\nA: Go to a store and buy USB bluetooth dongle (I bought the smallest I could find for $8).

I'd expected this to be easy to find on Google, but wasn't able to discover anything.\nI know that the working directory of a launchd agent/demon can be changed via the workingdirectory key. However, this key is optional. If no working directory is specified, what does macOS use?\n\nA: TL;DR\nThe default value is /, as in\n<key>WorkingDirectory</key>\n<string>/</string>\n\nExplanation\nThe WorkingDirectory in a launchd .plist is an optional key used to specify a directory to chdir(2) to before running the job. If this key is not present, then the root / directory is used.\nI verified this by running a shell script as both a Launch Agent and a Launch Daemon that, when run, appended a directory listing to a text file. In all cases, without the WorkingDirectory key, the output was the root / directory of the startup disk.\nDepending on whether or not it was run as root or the current user the output as root also contained the hidden directories even though that was not explicitly set to output by the script.\nAs a side note, the PATH passed to the shell script when run as both a Launch Agent and Launch Daemon was:\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nNote that this was tested under OS X 10.8.5.\n", "Q: iPhone and iPad suddenly can't access local IPs I have an iPhone 6 and an old iPad, and they are connected to my wifi and are browsing the internet fine.\nI'm also able to reach the config page of my router at 192.168.1.1 from both devices.\nUntil today, they were also able to browse my LAN to show sites I'm developing on my local server (e.g. 192.168.1.120).\nNow, however, neither iOS device is able to connect to LAN IPs other than the router homepage at 192.168.1.1.\nI've tried rebooting both devices, rebooting my router and cable modem, restoring my router settings to an earlier version, etc.\nUsing the \"Network Tools\" app by KeepSolid on iPhone shows that Trace Route works for normal sites but then fails for LAN sites such as 192.168.1.120.\nI have no idea what changed today.  The only thing I can think of is that my girlfriend took her Macbook out of town. But I have no idea how that could affect the rest of the LAN. She is not running a server on it.\nWhat else can I try to diagnose and fix this problem? \n\nUpdate: The \"Network Tools\" iPhone app has a DNS lookup utility. When I type in my local hostnames, they point to the proper IP addresses as the \"A\" record. Other records (AAAA, MX, NS, SOA, SRV, and TXT all say \"DNS server returned answer with no data\"). I don't really know what this means, and I guess it might all be irrelevant since hostname resolution is useless if my devices can't even visit an IP address directly in a browser.\n\nA: It's looking likely that the problem is a bug in the DD-WRT firmware on my Netgear WNDR3700 router.  \nI haven't been able to fix it yet.\nPeople in that thread suggest that running the following commands in the router would be a suitable workaround, but I haven't gotten them to work yet:\nswconfig dev switch0 set enable_vlan 1\nswconfig dev switch0 set apply\n\nUPDATE:\nOops, it's potentially not a bug in that firmware; I am even having problems after swapping out the router. But since this other router uses DD-WRT too (although a much earlier version of the firmware), I'm leaving this answer here since it's still my best guess and might help someone.\n", "Q: Is it possible to prevent TextEdit's \"The file has been changed\" dialog from appearing unnecessarily? Every so often, I  will be doing something on my computer (e.g., in Google Chrome), when an alert dialog from TextEdit.app randomly pops up.

The dialog sometimes appears even when TextEdit is not the active application; the dialog comes out of nowhere.\nMy answer to this dialog, 100% of the time, is Save Anyway.

You will need to disable System Integrity Protection to use opensnoop and can be re-enabled afterwards.\n\nA: Closure:\nI followed the instructions provided by user grgarside in their answer. \nI realized that the .rtf file was, in fact, being altered by another application. Hence, it is entirely appropriate that I was given the The file has been changed by another application. dialog.\nAs grgarside suggested, the dialog never actually appeared needlessly.\nSpecifically, the file was being changed by an AppleScript of mine. The solution was to implement a check in the AppleScript code, to see if the .rtf file was already open. If the .rtf file was open, then I made sure that my AppleScript code would not write text to this file.\nAfter I made the fix to my AppleScript code, I have never seen this dialog again.\n", "Q: Time Machine: Back up separate files to separate drives?

However, the App Store tells me that I have installed it and only shows me an \"open\" button. There is no Install macOS Sierra app in the applications folder. Spotlight however finds it, but it is marked as unknown version and does not start from there. I also cannot find it in Finder. Any ideas?\n\nA: I see several issues with different solutions. Let's try to fix them one at a time\nSpotlight\nFirst you should check if your Spotlight index is current. Search again for the Sierra Installation App. If it is listed, scroll down that list and click on \"Show all in finder\" (see Apple Support Page Description).\nYou get a Finder Window with all the Search results and if the Installer App is listed there you can get the Location and try to create the bootable USB Stick from there. You should also check the File Size and the Permissions of the Installer in case it is f.e. File Size 0 or you don't have permission to execute the Installer. You could also delete that Installer in order to reload it from the App Store.\nIf the Installer is showing in Spotlight, but is not showing up in the Finder you should rebuild your Spotlight Index (see Apple Support Page here or use a third party tool like Onyx, but be carful). Depending on your HD Size and Speed that could take some hours. \nApp Store\nIf the App store is still showing that the installer is present and won't let you download, you could try to delete (or just move it somewhere) your App Store Cache at ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstore. You should restart at that point and then try to Download from the App Store again.\nThere is a second (temporary) cache Location but only for downloads. You can get there fastest by opening the Terminal and typing in open $TMPDIR../C/. There you will find a Folder named com.apple.appstore which you could also move, restart, then try to DL again.\nTry these approaches first and see if that solves your Problem. \n", "Q: how to compile Marble (KDE) on macOS?

My iTunes XML export has not been working for months but I need it for DJ software like Traktor Pro. \nI would like to find and fix the problem and can't reset the database.\nWhen trying to export the whole library as XML manually (File -> Library -> Export Library) I can see Assertion failure: success == noErr (-8753) in the system log but that is ALL I know right now.\nWhat can I do find the root cause of this problem?\nmacOS version: 10.12.5\niTunes version: 12.6.1.25\nThese are my relevant settings:\n\n\nA: I've seen these libraries get a bit corrupted many times even though they'll still work perfectly in iTunes.\nI think that's probably what's going on here so I don't have a lot of faith in my first three suggestions but they're a lot less dangerous / serious & could definitely fix the issue. The 'nuclear' option I've listed last is safe to do but it involves rebuilding your entire iTunes database which if you're a DJ might be more than you'd like to jump to. If you have backups though it will always be fine to take the riskier route first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Just in case you haven't tried, uncheck 'Share iTunes Library XML with other applications' hit ok, open up preferences and check it again. Try to export.\n\n*We can test this on a clean slate with a new user. Copy (move if there's not enough space) the entire iTunes folder over to the shared area of your computer, and then create a new administrator over in System Preferences > Users & Groups. Restart & log in to that one, add your iTunes library by selecting it in the same advanced tab of iTunes preferences shown in your screenshot. This might take a little bit of time. Then try out an export.\n\n*If that still doesn't work, the last thing I would recommend to try is to replace the 'System' folder where iTunes & other system functions are kept in case there's an issue there. You can do this by booting into recovery mode by holding CMD + R while the Mac is starting, and install onto your disk. This won't affect your data or users at all - in only replaces the System folder where OS stuff only is at.\nWhen none of those work take the nuclear option and rebuild your iTunes library using these instructions. Backing up before this is a good idea.\n\nA: You may be able to find the root cause of this problem by evaluating whether or not the \"iTunes Music Library.xml\" file has a valid syntax using xmllint. For example, a Terminal command like the following may point out where any corruption exists inside of that XML file:\nxmllint --valid --noout ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Music\\ Library.xml\nIf the command executes without any complaints, then the file's syntax is probably OK. Alternately, if xmllint points out that the file has an invalid XML syntax, it should specify which line or tag the error exists within. It may be possible to correct those errors by hand if you're familiar with XML structure/syntax (but it's probably a good idea to perform a backup of the file before modifying it).\n", "Q: Excel, Chinese mojibake error On Mac, the Excel show mojibake \n\nHowever with Numbers it can show the right content.

My keyboard and mouse are connected via the monitor's built-in USB hub. There are no other displays connected to the system. I'm running macOS Sierra, but had the same issue in previous versions. I am using full-disk encryption with FileVault.\nMy issue is that whenever I power cycle my system, the display remains in sleep mode (monitor LED slowly flashes white versus solid white when it's on / Mac LED is solid white). No combination of keyboard presses, connecting/disconnecting peripherals, power cycling the monitor, etc. work.\nThe only way I can get it out of sleep mode is to type in my password and press enter with the display still blank (power save mode).\nI thought of this workaround after connecting a 1280x1024 monitor to the mac alongside my regular 34-inch 3440x1440 display (second display worked). I normally only use the one display though, and it's been about a year since I've hooked up the other one thanks to this workaround. Also, I normally keep the power on so it hasn't been much of an issue.\nI'm asking about this now because I recently upgraded to macOS Sierra and was disappointed to discover that the monitor would refuse to wake every time the system went into sleep mode! (not just when power-cycled)\nUltimately, I was able to resolve the sleep mode issue by powering down and unplugging the Mac (I read that this would reset the SMC). However, the issue remains when I power cycle.\nIs there a way to make sure that my display always works?\nI've speculated that maybe the FileVault boot screen can't handle the 3440x1440 resolution, but that seems like a serious oversight if true. Also, for what it's worth, when I boot up and the OS re-opens my windows, they are all clustered in what appears to be a 1280x1024 box in the upper-left corner of my screen.\nHow do I make my Mac Mini play nice with my display?\nEDIT:\nI tried resetting my NVRAM by pressing Command+Option+P+R on startup. I pressed it at about when the first chime occurred and waited for the second chime before letting go. After that, the password screen came up normally!\nHowever, when rebooting (power cycling) afterwards, I still had to type my password into a blank screen. So, the issue is not resolved.\nIt's odd that a keystroke on startup can make the display wake up normally but that it fails without it.\nEDIT:\nI tried the HDMI solution below after the issue of my monitor not waking up from sleep mode started happening again sporadically, so the workarounds above were not a permanent fix if anybody was wondering.\n\nA: I was able to resolve this by connecting the monitor to the mac mini with an HDMI-to-HDMI cable.

I would like to have a web app to be the only thing you can use with an iPad. I managed to make the website (a simple HTML file with lots of integrated JS) open full screen when added to the home screen as a starter, so there are no browser controls, just the app and a black panel displaying battery status and clock. On the other hand I can use the Apple Configurator 2 to lock the iPad to a single app like Safari but in Safari I have all the browser controls.\nWhat I would like to achieve is locking the iPad to use the web app full screen. However, I cannot do this, because in the Apple Configurator I can only choose from the apps installed on the MacBook it is executed on. Since the web app is not a proper app but just a starter on the iPad's home screen, it is not listed amongst the MacBook's apps.\nIs there a possibility to have the iPad locked into the web app in full screen, without browser controls?\n\nA: Yes that is possible and it is even easier then using Apple Configurator 2. You just need to go to settings-> general->accessibility->Guided Access.\nThen when you are in the webapp click three times the home button and draw where the you user can not interact anymore. They can not leave the app, or use the home and power button.\nI hope this is what you are looking for.\n", "Q: Remove and Reinstall Python on Mac -- Can I trust these old references? I'm new to the mac, and apparently I've made some sort of error.  I've been learning python, via tutorials, and between Homebrew, Pip and XCode somehow my versions are all mixed.  Pip3 points to python2, so all my python3 trials fail, etc... \nI'm researching how to safely remove all versions and then shoot for a clean install (homebrew?) but I'm a bit nervous. \nI've found some excellent links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstalling Python 3 on a Mac\n\n*How to uninstall Python 2.7 on a Mac OS X 10.6.4?\nClearly one doesn't touch anything in the root /system directory, and basically everything else gets deleted.

How do I clean up this python version mess?  Note: I'm using MacOS Sierra (10.12.5)\n\nA: So, I ended up removing all python installations, and reinstalling things via Homebrew.  \n\n\n*\n\n*which python ---> /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python\nDelete the entire Python.framework directory from /Library/Frameworks.\n\n*which python3 ---> /usr/local/bin/python3  Delete the entire python3 directory.\n\n*I was a bit nervous about the symlinks.

I recently was provided with the latest MacBook model, for which Apple decided to switch from a number of ports to just one, USB-C port and a headphone jack. The only two accessories that I use on a regular basis, a mouse and a headset, both require a USB port which was not a problem on the old models. One can purchase an adapter to fix this problem, either a USB-C to USB or a USB-C to HDMI+USB+USB-C. Here the problem arises that there is only a single USB-C port, and these adapters only provide one USB port. Is there or will there be a way for me to have both my accessories function? This doesn't seem like an abnormal problem to have, but I can't find very much information on the topic.\n\nA: You can plug in a USB hub to the available USB port on your USB-C adapter.\n", "Q: How can install an app I purchased on the App Store which is no longer on the app store? I bought an app called Palua on the App Store a few years ago. Now I have a new personal Mac and I believe the app is no longer on the store. I know that it works on the latest version of macOS since I still use it on my work Mac. Is there a way for me to install it again, since I did indeed pay for it? I do not see it in my 'Purchased' apps in the App Store, which is where I hoped to find it.\n\nA: Apps on the App Store (iOS, tvOS) and on the Mac App Store cannot be re-downloaded if\n\n\n*\n\n*the developer removes the app\n\n*Apple removes the app for various reasons (e.g. violation of App Store policies, copyright infringements)\n\n\nSince 2015 Apple removes apps from your purchase history as well. A well-known example is \"Monkey Island 2\" by Disney. It was removed with no option to re-download a copy of the game.\nTry to contact the developer of the app. Maybe he/she can send you a copy of the app.\n\nA: Actually, there may be another couple of ways for you to install the app in question. These are not definitive solutions as the success you have will depend on the specific apps in question.\nFirstly, you may be able to re-install it if you have Time Machine backups that contain the app. If so, you should be able to use that (especially since you're saying it still works in macOS Sierra).\nThe second option is that you may be able to use the version from your work Mac, depending on what account it was downloaded under and whether or not you're able to use that account. Essentially you'd just copy the app from the work Mac to your personal Mac and try running it. You may be prompted to sign in to the account when you first run it. \nHowever, some apps need to install support files in certain locations in order for them to work. If that's the case here, the second option isn't likely to work.\nOther options \nYou may want to check out FNable as it offers similar functionality.\nNote: I have no affiliation with this app whatsoever.\n\nA: I had the same question, as I have been using a small freeware utility (autoping) from the Mac App Store for many years, which I install on every Mac. Recently this utility has disappeared from the App Store as the developer apparently stopped updating it. It does not show up in my Purchased list either. I also could not find the developer's website or any comparable alternative. \nAs Apple makes it impossible to re-download apps like that, my only option was to try to copy the App Store installed utility from another Mac. It does not seem to have any copy protection, as it is a freeware utility. After copying it, it works without having to sign in to the original app store account. Its appears to be self-contained in the app folder.\nTherefore, for such apps its best to keep a backup copy around, in case they need to be reinstalled in the future.\nOld description and link to the app \n", "Q: Is there a known reason why the filesystem in iOS is case-sensitive? Developing an iOS apps, there was a thing that drove me mad: executing the same app that created the same files at the same path, the iPhone simulator worked the correct way, while a real iPhone didn't. I eventually discovered that i mistyped a character (uppercase instead of lowercase) and consequently the iPhone created a folder starting with an uppercase character, while putting the file in a path with that folder starting with the lowercase version of that character. The simulator however, didn't care of that difference. I suppose that was because the simulator, running on a case-insensitive system (OS X/mac OS), inherits its \"case-insensitivity\", while the iPhone (seems to me) is natively case-sensitive.\nIs there any known explanation/documentation by Apple (or other trusted sources) on why the iOS filesystem is case-sensitive, given that is an OS based on a case-insensitive one (OS X)?\n\nA: HFS+ originally ran on System 8 and System 9 and is case-insensitive. Apple developed the HFSX case sensitive file system around 2002-2003 as a replacement for UFS which was used by NextSTEP and could also be used by OS X.\nIn the transition from System 9 to OS X, Apple offered Carbon API's so that vendors could easily port their products without completely re-writing their applications. Carbon does not offer case sensitivity. For many years major vendors used Carbon code in their products, so HFS+ was left as the default file system.\niOS has transitioned to APFS but TimeMachine uses HFSX.\n\nA: I'm not sure about iOS developers' intentions, but  the better question is why would you make a filesystem case insensitive. Historically, making filesystems case-insensitive was a mistake.\nHere are some of the problems with case-insensitive filesystems.\n\n*\n\n*It's poorly defined (think unicode).\n\n*Every filesystem does it differently.\n\n*Case-insensitivity should be handled in the UI layer.\n\n*Case-insensitivity forces layering violations upon other code.\n\n*Case-insensitivity is contagious.\n\n*Case-insensitivity can lead to security bugs.\n\n*Case-insensitivity adds complexity and provides no actual benefit.\n\nIn my opinion this is a good enough argument to make the filesystem case-sensitive.\nEDIT\nApparently it is discouraged to provide links with more in-depth discussions so I'm removing the links.\n", "Q: Can I use any Sim to activate/set up iPhone 5s I recently ordered a straight talk iPhone 5s from swappa. I plan to just use it as a wifi device but my question is, can I use any sim card for the initial set up or does it have to be specifically straight talk sim. Also does the sim have to be activated and working?? And after the initial set up and activation can I simply remove the sim card and the phone still work as a wifi device? Sorry this is my first time buying a phone. \n\nA: Yes, there is a SIM card required to activate your iPhone. After activation you can use your iPhone without any SIM card (except some features off course). You could use a SIM card from your current phone, provided that it is a nano-SIM (i.e. the iPhone 5s SIM slot supports nano-SIMs).\n", "Q: Supported USB-C Alternate Modes on MacBook Pro (15\" 2016 and later) I am curious as to exactly what USB Type-C alternate modes (and variations of those modes) are supported on the 15\" 2016 MacBook Pro and later. I've done some searching on the Internet, but I've been unable to find any credible source of information on the subject. I would consider a credible source of information to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Official Apple technical documentation explicitly describing all supported USB Type-C alternate modes which are supported on the device. (All I've found so far is marketing info, which isn't specific enough.)\n\n*Analysis of USB PD traffic which might indicate supported alternate modes and capabilities.\n\n*Some sort of command-line utility or tool which is able to dump this information.\nI already know that the USB Type-C ports on this machine support the following alternate mode configurations:\n\n\n*\n\n*4 lanes using Thunderbolt 3.0.\n\n*4 lanes using DisplayPort 1.2.\n\n*2 lanes using DisplayPort 1.2 and 2 lanes using USB 3.1.\nBut I'm pretty sure it supports additional variations.\n\nA: According to EveryMac,  the model numbers of your specific CPU are i7-6700HQ, i7-6820HQ, or i7-6920HQ, which all have Intel HD Graphics 530. The specs list the resolutions that you can expect to find with DisplayPort and HDMI.\nHowever, in reality you can possibly do better. For example, there are active USB C to HDMI 2.0 cables which allow 4k@60Hz on 2016 MacBook Pros, when the alternate mode was only HDMI 1.4, or 4k@30Hz.\nNote that depending on your model you may also have an AMD Radeon Pro 450, 455, or 460 GPU. To find out, in the terminal, the following commands may be helpful.\nFor model and CPU system_profiler SPHardwareDataType\nFor GPU system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType\nYou could also save all of the system profiler information to a plain text file, and go through that with a text editor. Note that it can take a few minutes, and the file could be 5MB. system_profiler > output.txt\nFinally, before choosing a monitor, cable or adapter it can be very useful to search through the reviews and customer questions for your model. That's the only way that I found out a 2016 MacBook Pro can output full resolution and refresh rates to HDMI 2.0 monitors.\n\nA: \nI already know that the USB Type-C ports on this machine support the\nfollowing alternate mode configurations:\n\n*\n\n*4 lanes using Thunderbolt 3.0.\n\n*4 lanes using DisplayPort 1.2.\n\n*2 lanes using DisplayPort 1.2 and 2 lanes using USB 3.1.\n\nBut I'm pretty sure it supports additional variations.\n\nI'm pretty sure the USB-C ports on Apple computer support only the modes you listed.  I'm curious, why you believe there are more alternate modes supported?  What do you believe those additional modes might be?\nLooking up the supported USB-C alternate modes I can find HDMI, MHL, VirtualLink, audio adapter accessory mode, and debug accessory mode.\nMHL, HDMI, and DisplayPort are all video alternate modes for USB-C that came out before 2017.  Apple has little motivation to support multiple video modes, especially when they offer such similar features.  DisplayPort won out no doubt because it was already integrated with Thunderbolt, getting DisplayPort and Thunderbolt to play nice with each other on the same cable was a solved problem.\nMHL, like DisplayPort, can operate on 1, 2, or 4 high speed data lanes.  This means it could share the USB-C connector with USB 3.x but this is a protocol not widely used outside of Android devices that used MHL on mini-USB-B ports.  MHL seems to have died with the 5 pin mini-USB-B.  HDMI takes all 4 high speed data lanes and so it makes sense for Apple to choose to support HDMI on their mini-docks with DisplayPort to HDMI circuitry, this preserves the use of 2 data lanes for USB 3.x.\nVirtualLink was introduced in 2018 and is a protocol that is used for 3D goggles.  This is a pretty high end feature and so if Apple supported it then I'd expect them to advertise this where we'd notice.  I suspect that Apple would expect people that want to use 3D goggles on their Apple computer would just use Thunderbolt rather than VirtualLink.  A VirtualLink GPU can certainly be added by Thunderbolt.\nThe audio adapter accessory mode was added to the USB-C spec in 2017, this is a mode that allows for analog audio over USB-C.  If Apple supports this then I would not be surprised.  They've been pretty quiet about supporting this mode if they do support it.  This is a bit redundant on devices that have a headphone port in addition to USB-C.  Apple sells USB-C to headphone jack adapter but this uses a digital connection, proven so by it working fine on computers that offer no analog audio in their USB-C ports.\nI'm not sure when the debug accessory mode was added to the USB-C spec.  This is a mode for accessing low level data on electronic systems, but then Thunderbolt can do this too.  I can't imagine Apple supporting this as it is rather redundant to Thunderbolt and potentially opens the system up to security issues.  This is a pretty wide open spec on what the mode does and how it works.  It could be allowed as a means put any of a number of existing protocols on a USB-C port, or allow Apple to just make up their own protocol.  Again this would be rather redundant for Apple to use given the very capable Thunderbolt protocol, as well as USB and DisplayPort too, that they implemented on USB-C.\nUSB 3.2 and USB 4 are more recent versions of USB modes for use on USB-C, and allow for all 4 high speed data lines for USB data.  Anyone paying attention to Apple's product line knows Apple supports USB4 on their latest hardware.  What the USB people like to do is rename old USB standards as parts of the new USB standard so by definition all Apple computers with a USB-C port support USB 3.2.  USB 3.2 Gen2x1 is identical to USB 3.1 Gen2, USB 3.2 Gen2x2 is then adding use of all 4 data lanes for USB data and by doing so doubling the bandwidth.  USB4 uses all 4 data lanes too but USB4 can intermingle with Thunderbolt and DisplayPort on those data lanes.\nThat's all a rather long winded way to say that there's no real evidence of Apple supporting any modes on USB-C beyond what you listed.  That is until the USB people decided to rename their old protocols again and Apple decided to support USB4.  Given how little USB 3.2 and USB4 adds to what Apple already did on USB-C there's not a lot to be excited about.  I did speculate on why Apple doesn't support more modes than those you listed, and being speculation from an educated guess I could be proven wrong.  If there's more modes supported then Apple has been keeping it well hidden.\n", "Q: How does Bless work? I'm getting an SSD for my wife's MBP 2010. I was planning to install the old HDD and the new SSD into my MacPro and just use disk utility to copy all the info from her old disk to the new one. It would be easy enough and once the new disk is installed she can pick right up where she left off.\nBut I had an idea to reduce her downtime while the disks were copying. If I install the SSD into my MacPro first. then copy all the files over the network from her MBP onto the SSD. All I would need to do is bless the new SSD and I should be able to just swap the two drives and it should be perfectly bootable with all files and settings intact right? the MBP only needs to be down for the 15mins it takes me to change the drives.\nI'm just a little bit confused about how Bless works though. It just lets the computers firmware know where to find the boot-loader right? but is that info saved in the firmware? or is it apart of whatever filesystem the Blessed files exist on? I guess what I'm asking is, if I bless the SSD while it's in my MacPro, will it mess up the MacPro's boot settings? and Not make the SSD bootable? Or will it work like I hope it does and just make the SSD bootable so that it can go into the MBP and just work? Or do I need to add extra options for that?\nPS: yes I realize that this all just creates a bunch of extra work for me to save an hour (at most) of downtime on the laptop. But I had the idea and now I want to know.\nThanks!\n\nA: I'd think again about 'saving time'. \nWhile you're cloning it - however you do it - the chances are high that the work actually been done at the same time won't get cloned. To ensure it does, you'd have to clone it again...\nI'd just prepare for 2 hours downtime - or wait 'til bedtime - use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the old drive to the new [that would probably be easier in the Mac Pro, just in terms of physical access, unless you have an external USB/SATA drive adaptor], then just swap them over.\nIt will boot & you'll be back to where you were 2 hours ago, but with a zippy new SSD. It will also make a new Recovery Partition on the new drive.\nA little trick to make the swapover easier...\nBefore you clone the old drive & while not booted from it, rename the old drive to whateverNameOld, then make sure the new one is GUID/HFS+ & named whateverName.\nOnce the clone is finished & swapped back into the MBP, the OS won't waste any time at all trying to figure out where everything went.\n", "Q: Can I Recover an Erased Time Machine Disk? I erased (not deleted) the entire Time Machine disk by accident in Disk Utility instead of another disk.  Under \"Security Options\" it was set to \"Don't Erase Data\", so I would think that it means the data is there, but the directory and information of where/how everything is stored is gone.\nIs it possible to recover my Time Machine disk?\nEDIT:  In looking at disk recovery programs, some seem to be able to recover entire partitions if nothing has been overwritten (which is the case for me).  I'm using Disk Drill as an example, which appears to have this function.  So, I am wondering if recovering the erased disk to a new disk would be a way to get my Time Machine disk back?\nUPDATE:  Here is what I've been able to do:\n-I used Disk Drill to scan and recover all of the files to another disk, but as expected the file structure and names are all gone.  I also tried Disk Utility and Disk Warrior to try and repair/recover the directory with no luck.\n-I've created an full backup of my system on another disk to cover me for now.\n-I also have a disk I keep offsite that has just a couple of backups starting 6 months ago, but not as far back as my erased disk.\nIt just seems strange the way that Time Machine is set up, where basically everything is there, but no way to identify anything.  Someone should write a program that compares all of the nameless files against files on the machine itself to at least rename those files, and then the files that are related to it would have to be older versions of it.  Anyone have any other ideas?\n\nA: The chances of recovering the directory structure & therefore the data intact in its original form are minimal.  \nTime Machine uses a complex structure of links to files in order to reduce disk usage & preserve the actual timeline. \nYou may be able to recover specific individual files if you absolutely need something recovered from the history - though I'd be inclined to think that any recovery software will get confused by the linked structure & think it can recover 10TB from a 1TB backup.\nIf you feel you are safe enough with only a backup from today onwards, with no history, then I would say that would be the best plan.\nStart over, let Time Machine make a full fresh backup.\n", "Q: Can I put a MBP (2012)'s hard drive into a Lenovo laptop and continue using MacOS?

So on a 4K monitor your choices are either 1080p or 4K. I find neither acceptable. If you want 1440p (looks the best imho) you have to purchase a less crisp 1440p monitor or drop the big dollars for a 5K monitor and then run it at crisp retina 1440p which is exactly half of 5K and will not strain the GPU.\n\nA: I had to same issue and switched to mini display to display kable to connect my MBP to my 4K Dislpay now it supports 60 Hz.THe only problem is when i use a scaled resolution my screen is laggy. =(\n\nA: I was having a similar problem using a Dell U2720Q monitor, and the solution outlined here worked for me:\nhttps://www.dell.com/community/Monitors/U2720Q-MacBook-Pro-29Hz/m-p/7533720#M124865\n", "Q: Apple Watch app for hiking What's your favorite Apple Watch app for Hiking.\nI'm looking for something that provide this features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Integration with Health and Activities (i.e. calories, heartbeat, distance, GPS map, workout etc)\n\n*Shows relevant information while hiking (i.e. at least time, distance, and elevation)\n\n*Works without iPhone\n\n*Does not drain the Apple Watch battery too fast (the built-in workout app is fine in this terms, but too limited in functionalities)\n\n*Ideally has a web interface to analyze the data (like Strava or Garmin Connect)\n\n\nA: Unfortunately there are no apps that satisfy your needs.\nThe Apple Watch Series 2 can track your location using its GPS receiver, but it can't determine your altitude/elevation on its own.

These devices have built-in barometers that can be used to determine your altitude.\nI hope this answers your question.\n", "Q: Difference between network service disabled, inactive and interface down There are (at least) four difference ways for me to disable my Wi-Fi on my Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar and select \"Turn Wi-Fi Off\"\n\n*System Preferences->Network, select Wi-Fi, click Cog, select Make Service Inactive\n\n*sudo ifconfig en0 down\n\n*networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled Wi-Fi off\nThe first two are equivalent, i.e. they change the same setting.\nWhat I'd like to understand is, at a low level, what are the fundamental differences between 1, 3 and 4? \n\nA: Turning the wifi off through the Menu Bar is equivalent to:\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\n... and so, the same as turning it off in network settings.\nI cannot speak to the low levels, but networksetup is an Apple addition, whereas ifconfig is standard not just for BSD, but for Linux as well. (Though the two utilties are ultimately distinct, not just in their implementation but API)\nIf I had to guess, and I will guess since Apple's internals aren't exactly transparent (please, someone correct me if you're able), networksetup is meant to control the actual hardware, the Wi-Fi device, whereas ifconfig is a purely OS-level utility. Much like you can quit your video-chat app, vs put a piece of tape over the camera. \nA few things I can verify: \n\n\n*\n\n*To function, both the interface, say, en0, must be UP (so, ifconfig en0 up), as well as airportpower being ON (so, networksetup -setairportpower en0 on). \n\n*Both downing an iface, and turning airportpower off, will render the Menu Bar symbol as a hollow outline.\n\n*BUT, if both DOWN/off, if you bring airportpower on, if ifconfig ... up has not been run after running ifconfig ... down, then the symbol will not be hollow, and macOS will scan frantically for networks, but be unable to: (1) connect to a network (2) bring UP the iface0 (3) change the routing table\n\n\nSo, that wifi symbol seems to be the result of a state-change, not actual state. In that, the actual state of whether or not Wi-Fi is being shown as able to connect isn't connected to the visual indicator. But the interface, even when DOWN, does seem to somehow scan in a way, in that if you turn back on the airportpower, the \"status:\" given by ifconfig will swap rapidly back & forth between active and inactive, even if the actual interface is not UP.\nSo, there is inconsistency. But it's that way because there would be no reason to turn the second one off after doing so the first. And because Apple's desires & ideal API differ from those of BSD.\n", "Q: How to ensure security updates are installed without daytime interruption in macOS Sierra I have a Mac running Sierra that runs without any user intervention to control hardware. Every night it is scheduled to reboot and it automatically logs in and opens our control software.\nI need to ensure that it automatically installs security updates, but avoid having it automatically restart itself during the day. Is there any way to ensure that any automatically triggered restarts would only ever happen at night?\n\nA: I would suggest turning off automatic updates and scheduling a run of softwareupdate yourself. If you’re using shutdown to do the nightly reboot, you could turn that into:\nsoftwareupdate --install --all; shutdown -r now\n\nCNet has an introductory article on “How to apply OS X software updates from the command line”. Below, I’ve quoted sample output from a blog post (though an old one) where softwareupdate is used to install updates that require a restart. You might also be interested in an (old) hint on Mac OS X hints with a more complicated script that installs all available updates, reboots, and repeats the process until there are no more updates left.\niBook-G4:~ root# softwareupdate --install --all\nSoftware Update Tool\nCopyright 2002-2007 Apple\n\nDownloading iLife Support       0..20..40..60..80..100\nVerifying iLife Support\nwaiting iLife Support\nwaiting QuickTime\nDownloading Mac OS X Update     0..20..40..60..80..100\nVerifying Mac OS X Update\nwaiting Mac OS X Update\nInstalling iLife Support        0..20..40..60..80..100\nDone iLife Support\nInstalling QuickTime    0..20..40..60..80..100\nDone QuickTime\nInstalling Mac OS X Update      0..20..40..60..80..100\nDone Mac OS X Update\nDone.\n\nYou have installed one or more updates that requires that you restart your\ncomputer.

I would set updates to download but not install (except security updates which covers xprotect/gatekeeper), opting to do so via a script, which would contain something along the lines of\nsudo softwareupdate -ir \nreboot now\n\n\nA: All macOS updates which require reboot will start between 2am and 3am.

Now, with the new MBP when I press caps + a key repeatedly, or hold it, some strokes are omitted.\nThat results in very annoying behavior, for example in Terminal when I press caps-c, sometimes ^C and sometimes c is sent to the terminal.\nI've tried the following to pin down the problem but couldn't find a solution\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\n\n*defaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 10 # normal minimum is 15 (225 ms)\n\n*defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1 # normal minimum is 2 (30 ms)\n\n*disabling Accessibility tools like BTT or Spectacle\n\n*no .inputrc\n\n*rebooting to login screen and pressing caps multiple times also seems to omit some key presses\n\n*remapping caps to command and trying to open multiple tabs in Chrome with caps-t results in some tabs getting creating but also ttttt being entered into the URL bar\n\n*enabling Accessibility > Keyboard > Slow Keys in Preferences and setting a short delay decreases the likelihood of the problem a bit but it is still there and the setting also makes me type much slower\n\n*external keyboard caps remapping works and is without delay, so it seems to be a MBP15 2016 keyboard firmware issue\n\n\nIt seems Apple previously regressed on the caps delay 'feature' in 2014. Is this another regression in 2016?\nAnyone knows a solution or can reproduce?\n\nA: I was able to solve the problem. It seemed that the MBP was in some kind of HID configuration state which enabled the delay. To get the MBP out of the state, I reimplemented the 2015 Linux solution under macOS / IOKit. Sending 09 00 00 00 to the Keyboard, and then going through the remapping in Preferences again, removed the delay.\n", "Q: External Hard Disk Problem - doesn't mount / can't first aid / can't erase using disk utility I run MacOS Sierra 10.12.4 and struggling with my external 3.5 Data HDD not mounting after a short circuit in the Hard disk casing.

It is really annoying.\nIt seems people had this problem on older versions too but I prefer to ask again since it was like 4 years ago. \nWhat can I do to prevent this? Thanks\n\nA: It’s possible your Finder preference file is corrupted.\nOpen Finder, then press ⇧ shift ⌘ cmd G. In the popup textbox, type in ~/Library/Preferences.\nLocate com.apple.finder.plist and delete it. Restart your system and see if the issue persists. If it does, you can pull the file back out of the Trash and restart one more time.\n", "Q: Run zsh alias via automator? I am using zsh with oh-my-zsh in iTerm on macOS. There are some aliases defined in my .zshrc I use often, like this:\ndeploy(){\n cd ~/Path/To/My/Project;\n build ...;\n rsync ...;\n}\n\nTo execute this, I have to switch over to iTerm and run the alias.\nNow I'd like to be able to do that from anywhere via a hotkey.\nI've read that automator is the tool of choice.\nI created an action \"run shell script\" and chose `/bin/zsh/' from the list of available shells.\nBut running my alias returns zsh:1: command not found.\nAm I on the wrong shell? But echo $0 in iTerm gives me -zsh.\nHow can I run my alias without being in the iTerm window? Any approach will do, Automator is just how I'm trying to accomplish it.\n\nA: The solution is to source the file dependencies you need inside the automator script.\nExample if you added all of your scripts to ~/.zshrc\nsource ~/.zshrc\ndeploy\n\nYou can debug things easier by doing which deploy to check to see if that script is accessible.\n\nA: Automator runs in its own environment and does not read your shell rc files. The PATH is limited to /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin. None of the environment is exported for further use. You could define the function in Run Shell Script and run it like this:\n deploy () {\n cd ~/Path/To/My/Project;\n build ...;\n rsync ...;\n }\n\n deploy\n\nThough this is somewhat limited.\n\nA: I found a workaround without automator;\nOn https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/136931/60854 I read about hotkeys in iTerm.

The full command you should use would be sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 /dev/disk2s1. You will have to enter your password to continue. Although, I would suggest using FAT32, because FAT16 is likely inappropriate for your SD card assuming you bought it sometime in the past decade. An even better option would be exFAT, assuming all the devices you'll be using this SD card in support it.\n", "Q: Using dictation feature to paste text into Terminal With user-created dictation commands, it's possible to paste text into an application. I tried creating a voice command that would paste in a text command into Terminal. However, nothing gets pasted. I can see the command get activated because the \"Edit\" flashes. I am able to paste text into other applications with voice commands without an issue.\nDoes anyone know of a workaround to this problem?\n\nA: This problem continued for me when I updated to 10.13.3 but I found a solution.  Rather than using the Paste Text option when creating the new Dictation Command, use the Paste Data command.  Then go to TextEdit and type the text you want, select, and copy it.  Then go back to the window creating your Dictation Command and click on the Import from Clipboard button.  You will notice that the button moves down (I assume meaning that there is data there now).  Now my Dictation Command works!  I am not sure if this works in earlier versions of Sierra.\n\nA: Just make sure and enhanced dictation is enabled.  You do not need to create a new dictation command.  Just select the text you want to copy to your clipboard and speak the command “copy that” .  Then in the terminal app, just say the command “paste that”\n\n", "Q: How do I tell beta app review to test on a compatible device? I'm trying to do a TestFlight beta test for an app, but app review keeps rejecting it saying it crashes.\nMy app has UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities set to limit the devices it can be installed on. It doesn't support the iPad, but the app review team keeps testing it on an iPad, saying it crashes, and rejecting the binary. I've told them the above multiple times, both in the testing notes and when responding to the rejection.\nHow do I get them to test on a compatible device?\n\nA: All iPhone apps must be able to run on an iPad. If there is not sufficient technology in the iPad, an appropriate message needs to be shown. Your app cannot crash during app review for any reason. Apple may bring out an iPad which meets the device capabilities in the future and you shouldn't have to update your app before it works.\n", "Q: Normal temp in a MacBook Pro while using an external screen I've recently bought an apple cinema display to complement my old MacBook Pro Late 2011 and I've notice the increment in the working temperature of the machine while connected to the display. \nI know that the cause of that increment is the continuous use of the GPU when connected. However, I would like to know if the increment of 20ºC in the temperature is something normal. When it isn't connected the machine is usually working around 50ºC and now it's around 72ºC. \nMine is one of those affected for the problems with the GPU. Apple changed de logic for free in 2014 because the computer was covered by Apple Care. I don't know if they swapped the logic for a new one or refurbished. The operation happened in Finland and was made by a Apple Authorized Service. \nFor that reason I'm a little concerned about the temperature rise. I don't want to change again the board, even more now that it isn't covered by apple anymore. \nI just ordered a cooling pad that it's going to arrive today. I'm spending the summer in the west coast in USA, in Oregon. I don't thing the summer is going to be terrible, but I would like to be safe (better safe than sorry). \nSo the questions are two: \n\n\n*\n\n*Are these normal temps for the GPU? \n\n*Should I be worried? \nThanks a lot! \n\nA: Those temps seem fine to me. \nThe late 2011 MBP models usually range from about 40ºC (104ºF) to 100ºC (212ºF) depending on whether the CPU is idle or under load. CPU temps (just like ambient temperatures) typically have a bearing on GPU temps too, especially within the extremely confined spaces of a MacBook. \nIf you're interested, you can check out the Intel Mac Temperature Database for an indication of the various temperatures that Intel Macs run at. Unfortunately the database doesn't separate out GPU temps, but it's still a useful guide.\nThat said, I do understand your concern considering your Mac's history. I would just keep an eye on those temps when you're in Oregon to see how much the ambient temperature affects things. But a GPU temp in the mid 70s (ºC) or high 160s (ºF) is nothing to worry about.\n", "Q: Why does the USB-C Ethernet adapter get hot, even when unplugged from ethernet? The new MacBook Pro have a bunch of USB-C ports and no ethernet port, so you have to use an adapter.\nThe issue is that as long as the adapter is connected to the MacBook, it gets very noticeably hot, even more than the power adapter.\nThis happens both when the ethernet cable is plugged into it or not.\nNow, from reading other comments this seems to be normal behaviour, but I'd love to understand why! From an user's perspective, this does not seem right, and looks like it could cause the adapter to fail faster than it would without heating up.\n\nI have a USB-C to Ethernet Adapter, model belkin F2CU040. It gets hot as soon as plug the 100 Mbps Ethernet connector. As you can see in the figure, we are more than 20°C above the ambient temperature.\n\n\nA: It heats up because it's consuming/manipulating current.\nEven though the adapter isn't in use, it's technically powered up.\nWithout going too deep into electronics engineering, it's important to remember that the USB port is supplying a minimum of 5V.  Most USB-to-Ethernet controller chips operate at 3.3V (i.e. Microchip LAN9500A controller)\nThe factors that would create heat are basically twofold:\n\n*\n\n*Reduction of  the voltage to 3.3 volts\n\n*Powering the chip\n\nVoltage Reduction\nTo reduce the voltage, manufacturers use one of two components - linear regulators or buck converters.  Linear regulators, which are quite cheap compared to buck converters reduce power through the dissipation of heat.  Buck converters on the other hand, are extremely efficient (meaning the run cooler) but more costly. In low voltage scenarios, it's not uncommon to find linear regulators since the tolerances are so generous.\nPowering the chip\nLooking at the specifications page, the chip  referenced above uses 395mW (.4W) in \"low power\" or \"Suspend0\" mode.  Keep in mind, the device manufacturer may not implement these low power features for cost savings.\nWhen it's transmitting (sending data) it uses 692mW (.7W) of power.\nIn terms of heat transfer, 1W = 1 Joule per second.  Where a Joule = \"The heat required to raise the temperature of 1g of water by 0.24 °C\"\nTL;DR\nBetween the chip transmitting/receiving ethernet packets as well as converting ethernet to USB as well as the heat generated by reduction of the voltage it's supplied, it's not surprising the adapter can appear \"hot\" especially if the manufacturer uses less efficient components for cost savings.\n\nA: Circuits heat up when electricity goes through them. There must be some circuit created regardless of the status of the actual Ethernet port. It probably has something to do with converting an Ethernet signal to something readable via USB that is always on. \n", "Q: Sending text to an open terminal window with automator I'm trying to create a simple workflow to type commands into an open Terminal window that has focus.

I tried deleting the plist and restarting but still can’t open Safari.\nThere was a security update on 24 May but I cant get in to read it.\n\nA: There are a couple of things you can try\n\n\n*\n\n*Create another user and log in as them. If Safari launches there is something in your old profile causing this problem.\n\n*Failing that reboot your Mac holding down the Shift key until you see the gray Apple logo. Your Mac is now booting into safe mode. It will take longer to boot, so go get a drink and come back in 5 minutes. If Safari launches then there is something that has been installed that is causing Safari to not launch.\n\n*Download and run the latest Combo Updater for the same version of macOS that you currently have. For the current version of Sierra the combo updater is here.\n\n*Download a cleaning app (I use Onyx). Quit out of all running apps and run the app. In Onyx click on the Automation Icon and click execute. This will take a while, go have two drinks. When it is done reboot.

How can I properly purge this app? Are there files related to iTerm that my search is missing because they are named differently?\n\nA: Some apps write small files in various directories that do not get removed when you delete the app. There are some utilities that will find these and delete them whenever you move an app to the trash. By the sound of your problem I think this is the case. App Cleaner is one such app. Some suggest not using these apps for various reasons. I've never had a problem with App Cleaner. You can also manually delete these files but they appear in several directories. You can try 'ls -lRt | grep iterm' to find these files and then delete them. Not all files listed should be deleted though so be cautious about the ones you do delete. A third option is to do an internet search on 'completely uninstall files Mac' and some sites list where these files are installed.\n\nA: You can try sudo find / -iname com.googlecode.iterm*. This will give some more results.\n\nA: Delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist - would be a start.\n", "Q: Installing Putty on OSX?

I had successfully saved this file in Script Editor dozens of times today.\nI then Quit Script Editor and double-clicked on the .scpt file in Finder, to open the file in Script Editor (which is my default application for .scpt files).\nScript Editor responded with the following error dialog:\n\nIt reads:\n\nThe document \"My script.scpt\" could not be opened.\n\nI can launch Script Editor and I can create a New Document. But, I cannot open an existing document.\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting and shutting down the computer\n\n*Running \"First Aid' in Disk Utility.app\n\n*Opening Script Editor.app via the right-click context menu in Finder\n\n*Opening a .scpt file via the menu bar in Script Editor (File → Open...)\n\n*Opening a .scpt file via the right-click context menu in Finder\n\n*Creating a new document in Script Editor that contains zero characters. I can successfully save new documents in Script Editor, so I saved this .scpt file to my Desktop. But, after I closed the document window, I could not open the document in Script Editor.\n\n*All of my .scpt files originated in (i.e., were created by) Script Editor.\n\n*It may be important to note that I could open the .scpt files in TextWrangler.app and Atom.app.\n\nHere is the Sharing & Permissions pane for the app file (via Get Info window in Finder):\n\n\nThese two questions are similar to my own:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't save AppleScript file when created by touch\n\n*Why am I getting “Error -1,752” when trying to save in Script Editor?\nHowever, the solutions do not apply to my scenario.\n\nShort of re-installing the OS, is there anything that I can do to get Script Editor up and running again?\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \nScript Editor Version 2.8.1 (183.1) \n\nA: Personally if it was me, I would run disk utility app on my system first..  Then I would reboot and see if that fixes the problem. If that did not fix the problem, I would then go to /Users/your short name/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ScriptEditor2.plist. <—- and delete that .plist file, then reboot and fire up the script editor app to see if the problem is fixed.  You may want to make a backup copy of that plist file before you delete It.\nI'm not quite sure if that file is hidden in the system, So you may have to unhide hidden files before you can find that plist file\nThis is the script I use to show hidden files in the system...\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\\nkillall Finder\"\n\nAn alternate solution would be trying to restore that .plist file using Time Machine\n"]
