["Q: HDMI connection to external monitor causes laptop screen blackout in 14.04, nvidia graphics I have had some serious issues with my external monitor and graphics display since installing Ubuntu 14.04, and no one else seems to have had the exact same problem so I figured it best to post here.\nI have a Dell Vostro 3500 dual-booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 with Nvidia 310M hybrid graphics. Initial installed drivers with 14.04 caused persistent system program errors after booting, which was rectified by updating my drivers to nvidia-331-updates (http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/nvidia-331-updates). \nConnecting my Asus external monitor via VGA has given me persistent errors/crashes, so I am trying to get the HDMI connection working as it will hopefully be more stable. Unfortunately when I connect the HDMI cable there is no output on the external monitor and my laptop screen immediately turns black, and remains black even after unplugging the HDMI leaving me no option but a hard reset. The HDMI connection works fine in Windows 7 under performance mode, which is what I have set in Ubuntu but perhaps there are other settings that need adjustment? \nGuessing this is a graphics hardware/driver issue, which I know very little about so any comments/suggestions/advice in the matter would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance :)          \nEdit:  Here are images of the xserver log file (in failsafe graphics mode w/ HDMI connected): http://imgur.com/slPUqxt,72fTA0i,6HISdyp,dimKobC,qUklr89,TXppP5v,kNk1yaG,zghEn4n,4jo53dL,EBTsDJ3#0 Based on the warnings/errors (img 2, 7, 8), seems like directories/files are missing.. does this shed light on my problem? \n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect the HDMI\n\n*Install arandr:\nsudo apt-get install arandr\n\n\n*Reconnect HDMI\n\nA: Does HDMI1 and LVDS1 both show when you use xrandr in terminal? \nIf so you may be able to temporarily workaround it by using \nxrandr --output LVDS1 --auto\nIf there's no errors the display should turn back on. \nAlso if you want xrandr with a gui you can use arandr: \nsudo apt-get install arandr\n\nA: I had the same \"problem\" (regarding the laptop lid), the solution is simple: you have to raise the screen brightness, I don't know why but when I plug the HDMI the brightness of the laptop lid is set to 0 and it seems that the screen is turned off.\n\nA: I had the same problem and I solved it by changing the Nvidia driver.\nI put the proprietary driver, and since then everything works.\n\nA: with my 14.04 and my tv connected to the hdmi port\n  SYSTEM SETTINGS\n   DISPLAYS\nYour computer monitor and tv should be shown. \n  select your computer monitor \n   then check mirror displays\nyour monitor and tv should show the same .\nFor sound:\n click on the speaker\n  Sound settings\n   click on HDMI/DISPLAY PORT\nyou should have sound on the tv but not the computer\n\nA: With the installation of the Nvidia driver in Ubuntu distros, a second portion is also installed which provides control over the setting for your Nvidia card and its outputs, nvidia-settings.\nIn nvidia-settings you will find \"X Server Display Configurations\" and there, within the Display tab you can select your HDMI device, change its resolution to your desired resolution and its response time to your device's ability: 50Hz if outside North America, 60Hz in North America. Note that it may show 59.xx as the NA 60Hz claim is just rounding the actual 59.xxHz to 60Hz.\nYou can then select the other display device and change its settings in X Server Display Configuration to \"Resolution\" = \"Off\" and \"Configuration\" to \"Off\" if you do not wish to use it while using your HDMI, or change \"Configuration\" to Twin View for the same video on both, or make it a side-by-side screen so that you can use both at the same time. In addition, you may wish to move to the X Video tabs on the left and change things to your liking.\nLastly, you should move over to the \"GPU 0 (Nvidia 310M)\" and select the item which is your HDMI display and change to settings to make them best suite your viewing pleasure.\nWith NVidia-331-updates driver installed your fix is easy.\n", "Q: Upgrade to Kubuntu 14.04 Hangs at Stopping Cron I just attempted to upgrade from Kubuntu 13.10 to 14.04 using the Muon Update utility, but after downloading all required files, the update process stalled with the message \"Cron: Stopping...\" \nAfter several hours, I rebooted, and the machine booted normally.

Do you have any idea how to solve this conflict?\nI mean is it really sure that libmng1 is excluded?\nCould I use libmng2 somehow instead?\nIf not, could I somehow rebuild libmng1 for Trusty?\nOr do I have to downgrade back to Saucy (13.10)?\n\nA: When the major version number of a library changes, it usually means the library is no longer compatible with the previous interface that it provided. Previous versions of Ubuntu had libmng1, but now libmng2 is provided and all Ubuntu packages in 14.04 have been rebuilt to use libmng.so.2. Third-party applications, as in this case, may need to be rebuilt to work with the updated libraries in 14.04. Until then, you can try installing the library package from the most recent Ubuntu release that had libmng1.\nTo install libmng1 alongside libmng2, first find the most recent version in supported Ubuntu releases from http://packages.ubuntu.com/libmng1. Then download and install the appropriate package for your architecture. For example:\nwget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/libm/libmng/libmng1_1.0.10-3build1_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i libmng1_1.0.10-3build1_i386.deb\n\nNote that you will not get updates for this package since it is not in the Ubuntu 14.04 repositories.\nOf course a far better solution would be to get the application developers to provide a new build of SoulseekQt that works with Ubuntu 14.04 now that it is released.\n\nA: I tried several solutions, but the one that worked for me is to link it to an existing library in Ubuntu.

I typically upgrade downloading the relevant ISO (not necessarily the alternate one), going offline and then running:\nsudo mount -o loop ubuntu-11.04-alternate-amd64.iso /media/cdrom\ngksu /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade\n\n...and then connecting and doing an update once the system is installed. I do this for stability and so I can schedule the upgrade and update independently (i.e. juggling time and bandwidth).\nHowever, the Trusty Tahr release notes say:\n\nOffline upgrade options via alternate CDs are no longer offered for Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server. Please ensure you have network connectivity to one of the official mirrors or to a locally accessible mirror and follow the instructions above.\n\nDoes this mean that an offline upgrade is impossible, even with the non-alternate ISO? If it is impossible, can I still do the upgrade via a mounted ISO, or is a USB/DVD now required?\n\nA: It appears that the answer is no, an offline upgrade is not possible.\n\nThe reason behind this move, is enourmous amount of support cases of broken and partial upgrades since newer installation media will be missing manual additionally installed packages; packages that have now transitioned to new names; packages that have been removed from the default installation. Thus default install media for next release simply doesn't contain everything one will reasonably need to upgrade, hence the internet connectivity requirement.\n\n(from bug 1170531 via Alexandre P. - see that answer for suggestions on creating a mirror on your local network - this way one machine can perform downloads and other machines use it as a local cache)\nI confirmed this by attempting a number of variations on the old offline instructions, none of which worked. In the end I could upgrade using:\n\n\n*\n\n*network only\n\n*ISO on CD/USB + network for additional downloads (network connectivity required for upgrade to start)\n\n\nbut I couldn't figure out how to do it from a mounted ISO.\n", "Q: How to install secure svn server WITHOUT apache? I would like to install a secure svn server WITHOUT the need to use tomcat or any other java server. \nIs it even possible?\nIn any case no web access is needed.\nIf yes can you please provide a brief step by step answer because I am quite new to linux/ubuntu.\n\nA: It sounds like you want to avoid using a web server such as apache. Your two other options are svnserve or SVN-over-SSH. Refer to the SVN book for more info (see link at the bottom).\nSVN-over-SSH has worked well for me. You would need to set up a login account on the computer for each user. Then use the \"svn+ssh\" scheme instead of \"http\" in your URLs.\nHere is an example scenario just to try to get it working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the necessary software\n\n*Create an SVN repository in /tmp (just for testing)\n\n*Check out the new repo into your home directory, on the same server\n\n\nHere are the commands to do that, assuming your username is \"ubuntu\" like on the Live CD:\nsudo apt-get install subversion openssh-server\nsvnadmin create /tmp/testrepo\nsvn co svn+ssh://ubuntu@localhost/tmp/testrepo ~/testrepo\n\nBut read that with these caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*You should create your repos somewhere more permantent, instead of in /tmp.\n\n*To check it out on another computer, use your server's IP address or domain name instead of \"localhost\".\n\n*To create accounts for other users to use SVN this way, you can use the \"User Accounts\" control panel in \"System Settings\"; or on the command line, use adduser.\n\n*If you try this on the Live CD, you won't be able to check out the repo, because the default \"ubuntu\" user doesn't have a password, so can't login via SSH. First set a password with sudo passwd ubuntu and then it will work.\n\n\nAlso note that the svn+ssh scheme seems to create several SSH connections, and so it authenticates several times. For this reason it is VERY convenient to either save your login info in the SVN client, or else set up certificate authentication for SSH.\nFor more info:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.serverconfig.html\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/subversion.html\n", "Q: Is Avant Window Navigator Available For Ubuntu 14.04?

I downloaded the blender software from its official site and I read the installation procedure. It stated that blender can be run from any drives/partition on Ubuntu and all we must do is extract to the desired location. \nBut blender only runs on the root directory folder (/home for example). And I need it to run on my D drive where I have all my blend files from windows. So is there any way to run blender on any of my partitions?\n\nA: Probably you are talking about where Blender saves/loads user files. That paths are different from application's installation directories. Blender from repos doesn't install in /home directory. It has its main executable in /usr/bin and most of its required files in /usr/share/blender.\nYou might want to check this: File -> User Preferences\n\nAnyway if you want to use the version from http://www.blender.org/ and not from Ubuntu repos just extract archive contents to any folder/drive you like and launch blender's main executable blender. If it doesn't work open a Terminal and cd to the folder where you extracted the archive then:\nsudo chmod +x ./blender\n./blender\n\nLinux is not Windows. The so called root partition is Linux's main filesystem and any other partitions are mounted in folders that are in the root drive. No C, D, E... drives.

I was wondering if anyone knows if there is/will be support for tablet mode (i.e. screen rotation and input lock for the keyboard and track pad)?\nThanks for any support\n\nA: There are two projects on the subject of screen rotation:\n1) rubo77's screen-rotate-sh on git, wich is a manual executed script that could be mapped to a key/ combination. It also \"should\" disable the touchpad with the xinput enable/deisable \"$TouchpadDevice\" code in the script. \nIn my case it didn't so I changed the code slightly to execute synclient touchpadoff=1 instead. One or the other should work.\n2) pfp-schneider has created a auto-rotate script collection that is enabling the position sensors of your YOGA and using their output to rotate the screen automatically.\nYou can find the links to his git-hub on this post in ubuntuforums.org.\nThere is a usable step-by-step guide in the same thread in post #241. \nAs of today (16APR15) there is small mistake in the raw code of pfp-schneiders program that has to be fixed manually. A \"short\" explanation by (the smart, cunning, and good-looking) myself how to do it can be found in post #289.\nGreetings \nFelix\n", "Q: just have background after install I have just completed upgrade from 13.03 to 14.04. After logging in just have the background, no menus, no nothing, mouse travels across screen but keyboard does not appear to to work\nAnyone have any ideas please?\n\nA: It sounds like Ubuntu's gui isn't completely starting up, or is mis-configured. I don't know what exactly could be wrong, you could be missing graphic or other hardware drivers or something mysterious. Maybe Ctrl+Alt+F7, or ...F8 ...F1 etc might have some interesting messages or get you to a terminal to see how mount looks or read logs or whatnot? But I'd take the opportunity now to backup any important data you don't want deleted, if it isn't too late already, Booting from a live CD/DVD/USB should be up to the backup task.\nI've always read that upgrading Ubuntu has historically been a bad idea, it might often work, but it might often mess things up, like this. A better upgrade strategy advised has been to backup your home directory/data, backup any other data (maybe put them on a separate partition or disk, and if they're really important make a REAL backup to something that can be unplugged or some cloud) and then erase your old 13.04 (probably not 13.03 right?) and install 14.04. Then you can use your old home files if you want. If it were me, I'd backup, install 14.04 fresh, and then use old home.\nHere's some good-looking info I found about Help for booting problems, the linked answer is specifically what to do \"If an update or something else caused your boot problem\" https://askubuntu.com/a/162078/129271  It's too much info to copy & paste here, 9 different steps/tips based on your specific hardware & type of problem, and the main question looks helpful too.\n", "Q: Nautilus multihop ssh I would like to use the nautilus (or any other usable GUI file manager) to work on Virtual machine.

Changing the value with export, as you did, only applies to that session; so you can just open up a new shell (not a sub-shell) and see a familiar prompt.\nOtherwise, if you really want your prompt back in this session itself, just rerun your shell's preferences file. For Bash users, that is:\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nI don't know if that will work (at least, without causing other issues) for Byobu; but you can just set the prompt to a sane value like this:\nexport PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\n\nOr, if you don't want to or can't have a colour prompt, a simpler one would be:\nexport PS1='\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\n\nwhere \\u is your username, \\h is your hostname, and \\w is the full (logical) path of your current working directory.\n\nA: You can set PS1 to a reasonable value for this Terminal session using:\nexport PS1=$'\\h:\\w\\$'\n\nThe old value should also be restored after closing and restarting Terminal, a reboot, etc.\n\nA: I had this same issue. I used PS1 to set the prompt to \"Test\".. \nLater I was unable to go back to the default colored prompt. \nhowever i was checking some answer in this website & i had to check which shell i'm running. \nI tried $SHELL & it got reset to it's default colored prompt value. \n\"$SHELL\"\nI'm not a pro in this.

The set-up was configured before I joined the company, and the previous tech guy has since left. \nI got news this morning that users cannot connect to our VPN. I confirmed from my own PC that connection to the VPN was being refused (AUTH_FAILED - it is configured to authenticate against active directory on the Win2012 server and I triple-checked my credentials are correct).\nI suspected the failure may have been due to the recent Heartbleed bug and that any updated OpenVPN clients might require the host be updated too, so I logged into the Ubuntu server and issued \"sudo apt-get update\" and \"sudo apt-get upgrade\" - OpenVPN was one of the packages to get updated.\nI issued a \"sudo reboot\" on the Ubuntu server and tried to connect via OpenVPN again but it still fails (AUTH_FAILED).\nI then suspected that because the server and clients had been updated that I might need to issue everyone new certificates (though I hope this won't be necessary!), so I tried to administer OpenVPN users & certificates via webmin... however, opening the webmin web-interface also failed (connection timed out on \"https :// (ubuntu-server-ip) :10000\"). I have issued a \"sudo service webmin restart\" and it reports \"Stopping Webmin server in /usr/share/webmin\", \"Starting Webmin server in /usr/share/webmin\", \"Pre-loaded WebminCore\"; but further attempts to connect from the the Win2012 host PC still time out (I have also temporarily disabled the firewall and tried different browsers, but the results are the same)\nBoth of these services were working fine when I last tried a few weeks ago, and no-one has made any manual changes to the server settings in the intervening time.\nAny ideas what might have caused these issues, and what I can do to fix them?\n\nA: I eventually found the problem was the virtualbox host-only network adapter on Windows 2012 had reverted to its default ip address (though I'm not sure why), so the ubuntu guest which had a public ip on eth0 (bridged) and local ip on eth1 (host-only) could no longer communicate via eth1 and as such could accept connection requests via the public IP but could not make a ldap binding via eth1 in order to authenticate users - hence the AUTH_FAILED messages. This is also why I could not access the webmin interface from the host server.\n", "Q: Unable to run python file from terminal I am not able to run this Python file from terminal.\nI have added the shebang:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nat start of the file.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? How can I run this file from terminal?\nEDIT: https://imgur.com/YYBpILr I guess, this might be helpful.\n\nA: The screenshot below show the problem: you have an invisible char ^M after the python in the shebang line. This is probably a remnant of having edited the file on a non-Unix machine (typically, Windows); so the interpreter looked for is python^M which is not found. \nIf you haven't edited this file on a alien os, maybe it's a problem with the line-ending setting on your editor. Anyway, rewriting the shebang line in a sane editor should fix the thing up.\n\n\nA: Your file has Windows line endings, which unix shells don't like.  \nJust convert them to Unix file endings using dos2unix aaa.py (you may need to install dos2unix, which is a very light [200kB] but useful software) and you should be fine.\n\nDifferent line endings representations are a common source of \"strange\" problems. You can check line endings with file <yourfile> if it says something like:\n<yourfile>: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators\nIt means it has Windows line endings and you should convert them to unix, using dos2unix, the vim command :set ff=unix or your favourite text editor if it has the feature (many do).\n", "Q: Require all ISO images for Ubuntu LTS 14.04 I do not want to use internet to make online packages installation, instead I want to install the complete installation on multiple machines from local DVDs...\nWhere can I get the entire packages?\nThx\n\nA: I don't think you can get that on disc for Ubuntu (Ubuntu has more software in the repositories then Debian, and the full Debian is 10 DVDs for i386 and another 10 for x86_64).

Then all Qt based applications started to misbehave. Qt Creator (official IDE for developing Qt applications) crashed during startup with an X server specific error message.\nThis is truly frustrating for the developers. It is really sad to spend so many hours bug testing your application only to find out that the integration itself is broken and there is nothing you can do about it. Actually you can, but it is very frustrating to see so many things changing from the one to the other version of Ubuntu that require your code to change as well.\nWe had tested Wallch a lot of times, and we never had these kind of bugs.\nI am on the process of fixing these bugs myself right now.\nPlease for more information see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wallch/+bug/1310776\n\nA: To bring this issue back, I've been having issues with Wallch myself, and I seem to have found some small workaround to it. It involves using a terminal (which you'll have to dedicate to the program, but you can easily hide this away somewhere.) This solution applies to the changing of wallpapers from the normal wallpaper screen.\nFirst, open up the graphical interface and set the time interval you wish to have the pictures changed on. I say to do this from the graphical interface because I can't find a command line option that will set it for you, though I may just not have combed the documentation enough/missed something obvious. Besides that, the time seems to be saved even after closing out the graphical application.\nAfter setting your preferred interval, open up the command prompt and run wallch with the following command:\nwallch --change=[directory for pics] --start\nThis worked and got the wallpapers changing at the interval I wanted in the directory I wanted without crashing the application.

I'm on Ubuntu 18.04, x86-64.\nFirst, gcc and gcc-multilib must match the version of each other.\nIf you have installed multi versions of gcc on your machine, then you have to specify one version as the priority. For example I choose gcc 4.8:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 51\n\nThe greater the last number specified, the more priority it gets. You can check them out by using this command:\nupdate-alternatives --config gcc\n\nThen you have to install the version of gcc-multilib that match the version of gcc:\nsudo apt-get install gcc-4.8-multilib\n\nDone.\n\nA: For successfully compiling C code to x86 32 Bit executables in an x86_64 environment you have to install the following extra packages:\nsudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386 gcc-multilib\n\nAfter a compile call like\n$ gcc -m32 test.c -o test\n\nsucceeds.\n\nA: This problem also happens when gcc version doesn't match with the version of gcc-multilib. In this case you should install the correct version of the multilib packages. For example; I was using gcc version 4.6 so I had to install gcc-4.6-multilib and g++-4.6-multilib because default gcc-multilib package was for 4.8.\n", "Q: Preseed file whith ufw command do not work In Trusty the command ufw ufw/enable boolean true works very well, but the ufw ufw/allow_known_ports multiselect SSH do not work.

We'll call this computer A. You will select \"Create Account\" to set up the Sync account and the Firefox information will be synced from computer A. If any other device wants to Sync that information, computer A will have to give permission for that information to be shared.\nGo to any other device you have (your second computer, a phone, whatever, this will be computer B), except you will now select \"I have an account\".

I have tested Ubuntu 14.04 and Xubuntu 14.04 and in both cases I had issues with installing the latest nvidia driver from nvidia.com and also with being able to perform a scheduled shutdown using a GUI shutdown timer or from the command line/terminal with sudo shutdown -h ..... I also used software like Qshutdown and EasyShutdown but with no success so far.\nI know there is a solution for installing upstream drivers directly from AMD's website on this page but there is nothing similar for Nvidia.

How can I get involved in Ubuntu UX team?\nI think that Ubuntu is the most one of the Linux Distros in the world.\nEspecially, I am interested in Mir, Unity project to make Ubuntu UX.\nI am not experienced but I'd like to Ubuntu Graphics.\n\nA: Most open source projects, or projects that are otherwise open to third party contributions will publish some sort of development guidelines.  These are all different for each project and controlled by the project maintainers.  You'd need to look through information posted for any particular project to find out how to contribute.\nIn the case of Ayatana, the main page is located here.  From which you can choose browse a project like the notify OSD, which has it's development guide posted at this page.\n\nPlease realize that some of these pages may be out of date.\n\nIn the case of Ayatana projects, it looks like all of the development is taking place on Launchpad using the Bazaar VCS.  So grabbing a copy of the source and committing your changes to the VCS will be a good start.  You'd then be able to submit those changes via Launchpad.\n", "Q: Accidentally removed windows when dual booting (Ubuntu re-install wiped partitions) I am not sure if this question is appropriate to be posted here but I have really no idea and I really need to fix this problem ASAP and I am so frustrated right now.

Now I am left with Ubuntu but I still need Windows as my primary OS, I have backup up a system image of Windows 8.1 and my question is how to restore from that, loosing Ubuntu isn't an issue, any ideas would be greatly appreciated \n\nA: Manager Partitions\n\n\n*\n\n*Install GParted if necessary by running sudo apt-get install gparted;\n\n*Down-size your Ubuntu partition to create some free space;\n\n*Create a new partition and format it as NTFS;\n\n\nInstall Windows from a Recovery Disk\nSome computer manufacturers that pre-install Windows provide a Windows recovery/re-installation CD or DVD with the computer. However, many companies no longer ship a physical disc but instead create a hidden partition on the hard drive in which the recovery-disk information is stored. A utility is then usually provided which allows the user to burn a recovery/re-installation CD or DVD from it. If you are buying a new computer and intend on dual-booting, make sure you have (or can make) a physical Windows recovery/re-installation CD or DVD. If neither a CD/DVD nor a recovery partition/burning utility is provided by your computer manufacturer, you may need to contact your vendor and ask for a CD or DVD (to which you are normally entitled under the Windows EULA).\nYou may need to request a physical recovery/re-installation Cd or Dvd directly from your computer manufacturer. Here are some resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dell Operating System (OS) Recovery CD Creation and Manual Operating System Reinstall\n\n*Other related links and information for Dell owners\n\n*Lenovo Product Recovery CD or DVD\n\n*Getting recovery CDs from IBM for a Thinkpad\n\n*Obtaining a Windows Recovery CD or DVD set for HP and Compaq PCs\nConfigure Bootloader\nWindows 8, being an inconsiderate/ignorant OS, ignores the possibility of dual-booting; and just replaced your boot-loader.

I'm using a zenbook ux32vd with Intel 4000/nvidia 620m.

I'm running the flux 2013 script and default applications, along with chrome. Thanks!\n\nA: You need to install Bumblebee to turn off the Discrete graphics card. Follow this link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee. Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AsusZenbookPrime for kernel parameters to improve battery life. I am getting 5 hours with Ubuntu 13.10.\n\nA: What is your rate of battery consumption when you look it up in the power statistics? I get around 9W of power usage when I'm using the intel graphics with the exact same laptop/ubuntu/driver versions and it leads to around 3-4 hours of battery life. I installed a little indicator to switch quickly between the intel and nvidia graphics, here it is explained how to install it: http://www.webupd8.org/2014/01/prime-indicator-lets-you-quickly-switch.html\n\nA: I have a lenovo u410 which also has dual graphics card. I have found that my battery life has decreased from upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04. I did have bumblebee installed on 13.10 and not on 14.04, so I think that is my problem. I don't really use the nvidia card therefore I have switched it off in the BIOS and now my battery life is back to how it was on 13.10.\nI switched a setting called video from 'optimus' to 'UGA only'.\n\nA: I don't assume that your issue is the still running Nvidia Card (while I still believe bumblebee was more effective in switching it off compared to prime). I had a similar battery life. Then I did some optimzation by using the information from powertop to configure pm-utils.\nAnd now I have 4:20 battery life time.\n", "Q: Is there a way to switch users from the new lock screen?

So if you deactivated that feature, then the menubar would reappear. But now, Gnome is moving away from the concept of menubars in general, and this includes apps like Nautilus. Nautilus simply doesn't have a menubar anymore. The only thing Unity hides now, is the cog-button to display the menu that isn't useful because Unity displays menubars even though Nautilus doesn't have one. \nIn Ubuntu, developers have added support for \"shell menus\" by exposing the actions over DBus so that Unity itself can draw menubars and support HUD. In other words, if you wanted to have a permanently visible menubar for Nautilus in Ubuntu, you'd most likely have to customize Unity itself. This might be difficult, but it should be possible. You wouldn't get the menubar within the application itself, but you might be able to make it so that the menu was always visible on the window decorator and the title was always visible on the top panel. \nAnd of course, you have the opportunity to change Nautilus itself. \nBut I guess these aren't the kinds of answers you were looking for. To most people, the answer would be \"no, you can't get a permanently visible menubar in Nautilus\". We do have many file managers to choose from though. \nAlso remember that if you press Alt, then the menubar becomes visible, so if you have the menubar on the window itself, you might get used to simply pressing it when you need the menus to be visible. \n", "Q: icaclient on Kubuntu 14.04 x64 Has anybody been able to install the icaclient on Ubuntu/Kubuntu x64 successfully?

Provide next details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Server: smb://your_host_local_network_ip_address\n\n*Access as guest.\n\n\nYou'll be able to see Ubuntu shared folder.\n", "Q: Remapping Caps Lock in 14.04 Trusty Tahr I've seen a number of questions that point to a GUI menu to remap caps lock, but that menu seems to be gone in 14.04. Am I just not finding it, or is it really gone? I know you can use xkbmap to remap it, but I'm not really sure how to make that persist. \nEdit\nI've tried the suggestions on the accepted answer for this question, but nothing seems to be working. From what I can tell, the .xinitrc file doesn't ever seem to be sourced. Is there some other work around that might fix this for me?\n\nA: In my case the following worked to disable capslock in Ubuntu 14.04:\nsetxkbmap -option caps:none\n\nStartup Applications > Add > Name: Disable Capslock > Command: setxkbmap -option caps:none > Add.\nRestart and capslock is disabled.\n\nTo remap capslock to escape key:  \nsetxkbmap -option caps:escape\n\n\nA: After searching around enough, I think I finally found that magic google incantation to find the answer. Here's the post that solved my problem: Make setxkbmap preferences being set at startup. I just followed the instructions in the accepted answer and added 'ctrl:nocaps' to the xkb-options. I really hope they just bring back the settings GUI to change this....\n\nA: You should edit the file /etc/default/keyboard\nand modify the XKBOPTIONS setting.\nFor example to map capslock to control set XKBOPTIONS=“ctrl:nocaps” (source: Archlinux wiki\nlog out and log in again for changes to impact your system.\n\nA: Finally found a GUI answer, after much Googling: How do I swap Escape and Caps Lock in 14.04? (Looks like your question was phrased better and so showed up much higher in my search results.)\nFrom the linked answer:\n\nInstall the GNOME Tweak Tool (gnome-tweak-tool), under the Typing tab there is an option to swap Esc with Caps Lock. This worked for me in Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nStrangely, the tool window's background didn't fill in for me, so I had to open up a gedit window behind it just to view the text.\nHope that helps! Even with the buggy window, it was much more pleasant than messing with xkb settings directly.\n", "Q: Error connecting to Windows Terminal Server VIA network boot I am currently trying to load a windows terminal server screen instead of a Ubuntu screen , I keep receiving a blank black screen with only the cursor visible or an error screen with a lengthy busybox v.1.85 error which I am not sure of.\nI created a file in pathway ; -\npico /var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/amd64/lts.conf \nwithin here I then added the following ; -\n[DEFAULT]\nSCREEN07 = rdesktop\nRDP_SERVER = \"192.168.???.??\"\nI have configured the DHCP server etc and test machines but the only part I am stuck on is loading the actual IP address I inputted into the file above to run at network boot.\nCan anyone also explain what SCREEN07 represents.\nthanks.\n\nA: XX in SCREEN_XX is the session number. You switch beetwen sessions with keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+F01 (or F02 etc). You can have multiple SCREENs configured and switch at client without interrupting other sessions. Usually RDP session is set SCREEN_07, but it's not mandatory.\nAs of rdesktop. I don't have much experience with it, but I'm more familiar with Freerdp which is in fact a fork of rdesktop. So some troubleshooting steps might apply to both of them.\nIn Freerdp a blank screen might happen when the security of session is not properly defined. \nFirst: if the RDP server doesn't have it's own certificate issued by Certificate Authority , RDP client should ignore it.\nSecond: setting authentication type is crucial. Usually disabling Network Level Authentication is the simplest solution. \nSo your config should look like this:\n# xfreerdp's OLD style syntax\n[DEFAULT]\nSCREEN_07=xfreerdp\nRDP_SERVER=192.168.X.X\nRDP_OPTIONS=\"-f --no-nla --ignore-certificate\"\n\nOR\n# xfreerdp's NEW style syntax\n[DEFAULT]\nSCREEN_07=xfreerdp\nRDP_SERVER=192.168.X.X\nRDP_OPTIONS=\"/f /sec:rdp /cert-ignore\"\n\nCheck rdesktop manual and use it's options analogously.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 64bit - computer shuts down by itself After I installed Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit on my Lenovo ThinkPad T61 today, I could boot up Ubuntu without problem but after I run the Software Center, Additional Driver, or Firefox, the computer will shut itself down. Could it be possible that the 64-bit version is not compatible? I used to use 12.04 32-bit without any problems.\n\nA: I don't think that's the likely cause, if your computer was incompatible with 64-bit linux (x86_64) it would not boot at all. I would check the fans, it may be overheating. You might also check the power settings.\n\nA: Happens to me too. It just shuts down at random intervals.

This is scheduled for July 24th 2014, when the first dot-release (service pack) becomes available as Ubuntu 14.04.1.  \nUpgrading a whole distribution of software is entirely different from just upgrading an OS like Windows or OS X. When you upgrade Ubuntu, all your software is upgraded and is supposed to work without any configuration or that sort of thing. This makes the upgrade process much more difficult than a clean install and thus requires more time to develop. So the LTS-upgrade process is still in development even if 14.04LTS itself is stable. \nThis is why LTS users are never presented with an upgrade path until a few months after the new version is released. \n", "Q: right to left languages in libreoffic How to write both English and another language which is right to left in a line.

The larger differences between the two LTS versions means they need more time to get it right. \nIn your case, you'll be presented with an option to upgrade when Ubuntu 14.04.1 is released, which is scheduled for July 24th 2014. \n\nA: As Jo-Erlend Schinstad mentioned they are somewhat delayed while some bugs that normally appear on the first days are solved. If you still want to migrate then you can do it this way:\nsudo update-manager -d\n\nor even\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nBe aware that if you used 3rd party PPAs or even some type of packages that add their own repositories, this procedure will fail at the end and will not update your system. You would have to upgrade the system using a LiveDVD or LiveUSB in which case, in the Ubuntu installer it will say \"Upgrade Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04\".\nOn both cases, downloading the ISO or upgrading, the upgrade will be huge because of the many packages that have changed so it will take a bit of time.\n", "Q: Retrieve data from Ubuntu I had a dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu(on two separate hard drives) that worked fine until I had to reinstall Windows 7.

Once you kill this sub-process the installation process will start again and complete cleanly.\nThis is related to something involving updating of the man-db. It is not related to subversion, or python, or whatever was being unpacked. That was just the last bit in the logs. The problem is something related to man-db and (probably) perl.\nRecommending a fresh install as a first course of action is not exactly helpful. That's what you do when problem solving fails. It isn't a solution.\n\nA: I hit this exact problem doing an upgrade from 12.04 -> 14.04. I was unable to kill the frontend process as described above, because although I could launch an Xterm window, sudo and su segfaulted due to the system being half-upgraded.\nHowever, I recovered from the situation by rebooting, going into recovery mode, and getting it to fix broken packages. This effectively restarted the upgrade process in command line mode and I ended up (eventually) with a usable 14.04 system.\n\nA: I had a similar problem but was stuck at starting mysql. \nps fax | less and found frontend.

Open the log file with the following:\ngedit /var/log/apt/history.log\n\nHere, use Ctrl+F to search the term \"lubuntu-desktop\" and you should see something like this:\n\nNote: If you don't find the command here, as it happened to me, the log file has been rotated. Go to /var/log/apt/ with nautilus /var/log/apt/, double-click history.log.1.gz and open history.log.1 (look the name of the gedit tab in the previous image).\nNow, select all the packages until the \"End-Date:  2014 ...\" line, copy and paste them in a new gedit file. As you can see, these packages are in the form \"package_name:i386 (something between parenthesis)\". Note that \"i386\" could be \"amd64\" depending on your OS. Now, from what we've got, only the package name is important. To remove the extra stuff, press Ctrl+H to invoke the find & replace tool. In the Search for input field, type (again, depending on your OS):\n\n:i386 \\([0-9\\:\\~\\.\\+a-zA-Z\\-, ]*\\),?\n:amd64 \\([0-9\\:\\~\\.\\+a-zA-Z\\-, ]*\\),?\n\nLeave the Replace with field blank, check coincide regular expression and press Replace all.\n\nNow, you have the list of installed packages separated by space, so copy them, open up your terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get remove --auto-remove *paste packages*\n\nAnd that's it.

But they are not working at all. I am using gnome desktop.\n\nA: Look here and here.\nThese (old, nice) programs were designed when the root window was a window, DBUS and gsettings where unknown, and the concept of desktop environment was to install fvwm. You need to recompile them with tricks and often also then they wouldn't work...\n\nA: The reason xsnow-1.42 does not work on modern desktops, is that xsnow-1.42 is using the root-window to paint in, and the modern desktops do not use the root window to show the desktop but use another window. This has been addressed by a new version of xsnow.\n\nA: I know it is already solved, but it didn't work for me, I tried to find a solution, and did it!

I started out with a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 server set up on a 10GB LVM partition. The only other thing I did was to then install the xen-hypervisor:\nsudo apt-get install xen-hypervisor-amd64\n\nI double checked that my hardware could support it (MSI Z87I motherboard and Intel i5-4570S cpu) and that I had virtualization set in the BIOS. I also double checked that GRUB defaults to boot into xen and that the xen toolchain is set to xl (not that that would likely cause my problem).\nHowever, my system enters an endless cycle of booting up and rebooting until I tell GRUB to boot into regular Ubuntu. Here are the only things that show up whenever it tries booting into xen:\nLoading Xen 4.4-amd64 ...\nWARNING: no console will be available to the OS\nLoading Linux 3.13.0-24-generic ...\nLoading initial ramdisk ...\n\nAnd then it reboots the system. Is there any error logs to check or any other boot parameters to try (the parameters are still set to the default)? Is it related to the above WARNING?\nEdit: I gave up since there was nothing to go on and ended up dual-booting Windows and Ubuntu. I'd be willing to re-install on another partition if anyone has any ideas however.\n\nA: Someone suggested to set my BIOS to do legacy booting, so I put my BIOS in Legacy+UEFI mode. It didn't work, so I thought maybe Ubuntu had to be installed without the extra UEFI boot files, but I never got a chance to. Before I left for the weekend, I booted into Windows to do some work. I randomly decided to run my motherboard's updating program (Windows only - luckily I just bought Windows) which was taking hours, so I just left it running. Came back after the weekend, and it just worked! Specifically, I updated my BIOS from version 1.00 to 1.60.\nFor whoever is unlucky enough to have the same exact problem: link to BIOS upgrade tool.\n\nA: If you want to check the error logs, mount the LVM and check if there's some in /var/log/.\nBTW, Xen server works fine in my VMware VirtualMachine.And the same with VirtualBox VM.\nhttp://blogs.citrix.com/2011/01/23/xenserver-in-virtualbox/\n\nA: Fixed by legacy booting\nI was just having the same problem on my Intel NUC. The system was installed to boot as EFI and legacy booting was completely disabled in BIOS.\nAfter installing xen-hypervisor, I ran into the same reboot loop.\nWhat fixed the problem for me was enabling legacy booting again, although the system is still booting via EFI and not even capable of booting to legacy.\n", "Q: How to install Synaptics on touchpad on Ubuntu 14.04 I've recently upgraded my system to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS version but Previously i was in Ubuntu 13.10 where i used to operate my touchpad with circle scrolling. But Now in the Ubuntu 14.04 there is no \" synaptiks \" package on Ubuntu software center so please help me to install the package or any alternative to use circle scrolling?\n\nA: For14.04\nYou can download the .deb file from debian here http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/synaptiks/kde-config-touchpad_0.8.1-2_all.deb\nand you can install it using something like dpkg or gdebi or just execute the following commands.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wget gdebi\nwget http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/synaptiks/kde-config-touchpad_0.8.1-2_all.deb\nsudo gdebi kde-config-touchpad_0.8.1-2_all.deb\nsudo apt-mark hold kde-config-touchpad=0.8.1-2\n\nTo set up synaptiks, open a terminal and type:\nsynaptiks\n\nYou will see a few errors and something about a broken pipe or syntax whatever . . . just ignore it because it doesn't matter.\nWhen that's done just use ALT + F2 and type synaptiks\nthis time, synaptiks should open up fine with no troubles.\n\nA: As you can see on the package page on launchpad, synaptiks has been developed until Ubuntu 13.10. I tried installing the package for 13.10 on 14.04 but it conflicts with the default Ubuntu Mouse & Touchpad utility. A package for 14.04 could be made available in the future, but I'm not sure about that. Since I was missing this utility too, and the default one is missing some customization options, in the meantime I'm using Gpointing device settings. It is pretty good and it allows circle scrolling. You can find it in the Software Center.\nUPDATE: It seems that Gpointing device settings is no longer maintained, and the version from the Software Center doesn't save settings after reboot. I couldn't file another GUI application, so I had to use xinput from the terminal. This is how you do it:\n1) Check the name of your device:\nxinput list\n\n2) See available options for your device:\nxinput list-props \"Your Device Name\"\n\n3) Edit settings (to make settings consistent after reboot/shutdown just add this command to Startup Applications):\nxinput set-prop \"Your Device Name\" \"Option Name\" \"Value\"\n\nHere is an example command I used to activate locked drags:\nxinput set-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Locked Drags\" 1\n\nTo activate Circle Scrolling just look for it in your device available options and play with them until you get the desired result, then add the command to Startup Applications and you're done! Hope it helps! : )\nSECOND UPDATE: Another nice GUI application you can try is touchpad-indicator:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/atareao\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install touchpad-indicator\n\n\nA: On my fresh Kubuntu 14.04 LTS install, the synaptiks package was not installed (or available), but the touchpad drivers were detected and configured correctly.\nThus I'm running KDE, not Gnome.\nI can access settings for \"circular scrolling\" and \"disable touchpad when mouse is plugged in\" by accessing the touchpad settings under System Settings > Input Devices > Touchpad.\nThus no reason for me to install the synaptiks package on my current hardware stack.\nSee screenshots below:\n\n\n\nA: Go into bios and change touchpad from advanced to basic. This worked for me.\n", "Q: \"Starting Wireless Hotspot...\" but nothing happens I was trying to create an WiFi hotspot for my android device. I used ap-hotspot to do so.  \nI configured the ap-hotspot using  \nsudo ap-hotspot configure\n\nThen I started ap-hotspot using \nsudo ap-hotspot start\n\nThen it shows this \nStarting Wireless Hotspot...\n\nAnd then nothing happens, no further message is displayed, hotspot is not created.\nWhat is Wrong? How to fix it?\n\nA: ap-hotspot uses hostapd to create wireless network\nI had problems creating hotspot using hostapd in Ubuntu 14.04 mainly because new version of hostapd in 14.04 default repository is buggy.\nYou can solve this problem by downgrading hostapd in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to a previous version\nUninstall buggy hostapd using apt-get:\nsudo apt-get remove hostapd\n\nThen install non-buggy version of hostapd:\n\n\n*\n\n*64 - bit:\ncd /tmp\nwget http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wpa/hostapd_1.0-3ubuntu2.1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i hostapd*.deb\nsudo apt-mark hold hostapd\n\n\n*32 - bit:\ncd /tmp\nwget http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wpa/hostapd_1.0-3ubuntu2.1_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i hostapd*.deb\nsudo apt-mark hold hostapd\n\n\"sudo apt-mark hold hostapd\" will prevent hostapd to upgrade to the buggy version. \nThen try running ap-hotspot again, I think it should work.

I want to use gnucash. However I am not familiar with the English terminalogy regarding finance. Now I wanted to start gnucash with the Dutch translation, which I believe is available for 2 reasons. Firstly the gnucash site is also in Dutch, and secondly when I look to the wiki regarding starting gnucash with a different language I see also the Dutch translation been specified. \nThe problem I have is that I cannot seem gnucash to startup with the Dutch translation using LANGUAGE=nl_NL.UTF8 LANG=nl_NL.UTF8 gnucash\nChecking locale -a, I obtain:\nC \nC.UTF-8 \nen_AG \nen_AG.utf8 \nen_AU.utf8 \nen_BW.utf8 \nen_CA.utf8\nen_DK.utf8 \nen_GB.utf8 \nen_HK.utf8 \nen_IE.utf8 \nen_IN \nen_IN.utf8 \nen_NG\nen_NG.utf8 \nen_NZ.utf8 \nen_PH.utf8 \nen_SG.utf8 \nen_US.utf8 \nen_ZA.utf8\nen_ZM \nen_ZM.utf8 \nen_ZW.utf8 \nnl_AW \nnl_AW.utf8 \nnl_BE.utf8 \nnl_NL.utf8\nPOSIX\n\nSo why don't I get gnucash to startup with the Dutch language?\n-edit-\nI installed all the Dutch language packages by\n\nsudo apt-get install language-pack-nl language-pack-gnome-nl\n  language-pack-nl-base language-pack-gnome-nl-base\n\nStill no success unfortunately. However when I now tried to startup gnucash using LANGUAGE=nl gnucash I didn't get the warning The locale defined in the environment isn't supported. Falling back to the 'C' (US English) locale. However gnucash was still in English.\n-edit2- \nOutput of locale\nLANG=nl_NL.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=nl:en\nLC_CTYPE=\"nl_NL.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=nl_NL.UTF-8\nLC_TIME=nl_NL.UTF-8\nLC_COLLATE=\"nl_NL.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=nl_NL.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=\"nl_NL.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=nl_NL.UTF-8\nLC_NAME=nl_NL.UTF-8\nLC_ADDRESS=nl_NL.UTF-8\nLC_TELEPHONE=nl_NL.UTF-8\nLC_MEASUREMENT=nl_NL.UTF-8\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=nl_NL.UTF-8\nLC_ALL=\n\n\nA: The gnucash-common package appears to only have plain nl as a translation for Dutch. I am not sure why, but it appears that the loading of translations is not falling back to that as an option.\nHowever, running LANGUAGE=nl_NL.UTF-8 ANG=nl_NL.UTF-8 gnucash in the terminal, does seem to work for me. Is one of these variables not set correctly in your environment? Are you missing a language-pack package that may be required for the translations to work in your language in gnucash? You may need language-pack-gnome-nl-base installed for it to work.\n\nA: Since gnucash is a GNU application, it uses the LANGUAGE variable.\nLANGUAGE=nl gnucash\n\nis what you want.\nThe reason why\nLANGUAGE=nl LANG=nl gnucash\n\ndoes not work is that LANG requires a valid locale name, which nl is not, so you broke your locale and it used the fallback language English.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with gnucash - finally i found the solution in the wiki:\n\nNotes for Ubuntu users\nIf the previous instructions don't works, please check the following items:\nif you have installed localepurge package, be sure that the locale you are using is not deleted after the installation of gnucash. To check this, reconfigure localepurge, and be sure to not include your locale in the list of the ones to be deleted\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure localepurge\nThen reinstall all gnucash packages:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall gnucash gnucash-common gnucash-doc\n\nIn my case (LANG=de_DE), the de_DE entry was already excluded, but additionally i had to exclude the de entries, too. So, you may have to exclude the nl entry from localpurge, too.\n", "Q: Install Software with dpkg I installed SME dpkg -i sme.deb, it installed it but I could not start it.\nHowever when I started the software center it told me that something was broken and it needed fixing, so I allowed it and after it was finished, SME started.\nSo what I want to know should i install deb files with dpkg -i commend or should I use other commend ???\nThank you for your time \n\nA: dpkg tells you what went wrong if you read its output.\nHowever if you like GUI apps, I would recommend GDebi to install deb files, although if something goes wrong it will recommend you to open a terminal and do a sudo apt-get install -f.\nTo install GDebi: sudo apt-get install gdebi.

Can I remove that entry or re-order them?  It would be great to have Copy come first and Paste second?  I use those much more often that opening a tab or terminal (intentionally).\nupdate\nI can duplicate the behavior (in 13.10) with a mouse- right clicking and dragging diagonally right and down will open a new terminal, but only if done quickly. If I right click and pause then I have to left click the menu options as expected.\nupdate 2\nIt's starting to become more clear: there is an intentional feature of the right click menu that allows a right click and hold followed by the release of the right click on the context menu item of choice, which coexists with the right click release followed by a selection of the menu item and second right or left click.  \nThe problem for me is when I'm intending to right click release and then select a menu item and a perform a second click.  If the cursor is already moving down and right, or if I begin to make that move before releasing the right click, I get the undesired new terminal.  I may be unconsciously trying to optimize the operation by getting a running start, or it is just random mouse movement.\n\nA: In order to disable or reorder the gnome-terminal context menu, you should try editing the terminal.xml file located in /usr/share/gnome-terminal/ directory.\n1) Make a backup of the terminal.xml file. \nOpen a Terminal window Ctrl+Alt+T and type:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /usr/share/gnome-terminal/\n\n*sudo cp -p terminal.xml terminal.xml.bak\n2) Edit the terminal.xml file with your favorite editor. eg: nano\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo nano -c /usr/share/gnome-terminal/terminal.xml\nRegarding to your question you can comment the lines for the PopupNewTerminal PopupNewTab PopupCloseTab PopupCloseWindow  menus. (Lines 88 to 93)\n\nYou can comment those lines with <!-- lines --> symbols.\n\nTo save the changes in nano.. Ctrl+O,Enter then Ctrl+X.\nExit or Close the Terminal window and open it again to see the changes.\nBEFORE:\n\nAFTER:\n\nThis is just an example, you can comment, delete or change the order in the menus (put the PopupCopy and PopupPaste menus before the PopupNewTerminal) in the file.\nJust in case... please remember you have a backup of the terminal.xml.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: No, the order of the menu items cannot be changed by any settings, nor can it be disabled. If disabling tap-to-click does not work, you should file a bug report against the xserver-xorg-input-synaptics package. You can do that by running ubuntu-bug xserver-xorg-input-synaptics in your terminal.\n\nA: The solution so far looks to be to untrain the right-click-release, menu select, click operation (maybe that came from  Windows?), and just do the right click and hold and then release on the desired menu item- making sure the cursor is still would slow things down too much.  \nI believe click-hold-move-release is worse for carpal tunnel/repetitive strain, but so perhaps is having to close a bunch unwanted terminal windows.\nAnother possible solution would be if I could move the cursor from the keyboard and copy and paste vim-like, shortcuts to select text in terminal suggests screen (though the Ctrl + A then Escape command to enter copy mode is not ideal)\n", "Q: How to solve overheating problem?

Nvidia graphics gives much better performance but is also power expensive which results into overheating. Bumblebee gives you option to use only graphic heavy applications with nvidia graphics thus reducing overheating.\nGuide to Install Bumblebee\nAfter installation you can run any application with nvidia graphics by using optirun <application-name> from terminal.\nAlso you can try indicator-cpufreq which lets you put your profile to conservative, also reduce CPU frequency from applet-icon to prevent overheating when computational load is low.\n\nA: First make sure you have Nvidia's own binary driver installed and not the open-source version that comes with Ubuntu (run Additional Drivers)...\nThen install Bumblebee in the software centre so you can switch between your build in Intel graphics and Nvidia graphics, otherwise both will be running at the same time and your laptop will overheat and run out of battery quickly...\n\nA: Also happens to some HP laptops, such as my Probook 4530s.

This stopped overheating during games and other CPU intensive operations. \nCheck out this question as well as the tag [turbo-boost] \n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 This is my first time trying to install ubuntu. I have a flash drive that will boot to the installation. But once I egg there it says it can't find an os on the computer. What do I do? \n\nA: Press a key when start up your computer and check if there are any options for you to get into systems like \"widows load manager\" or \"ubuntu\".\nI guess your windows system is under UEFI mode and your ubuntu should also be installed under this mode.\nIf that is the case, check your bios to see if your computer is booting under UEFI mode. If you choose legacy, the problem you described is likely to happen.\nAlso if you are using a RAID with any ssd caching technology like intel rst,, just turn that off.\n", "Q: Installing TexLive 2013 with starlinq instructions I'm following this guide on how to install TeX Live on Ubuntu 12.04 (and I'm trying to install TeX Live 2013, not 2012.).

I don't know how to create a new partition so can someone please help me out?\n\nA: It's indeed much more convenient to work from GUI tool (it is simple even for beginners) like [gparted](www.gpated.org]. If you can install it then go for this, sudo apt-get install gparted or download it as .deb file and then sudo dpkg -i file.deb\nAlso you can do your partitioning stuff from another Live CD like Ubuntu or even from Gparted Live CD.\nYou could do it right now on your machine by fdisk but check this example out and believe me, you first want gpared:\nExample:\n$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\nCommand (m for help): p\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048     9437183     4717568   83  Linux\n\nCommand (m for help): d\nSelected partition 1\n\nCommand (m for help): p\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n\nCommand (m for help): n\nCommand action\n   e   extended\n   p   primary partition (1-4)\np\nPartition number (1-4, default 1): 1\nFirst sector (2048-10485759, default 2048):\nUsing default value 2048\nLast sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (2048-10485759, default 10485759):\nUsing default value 10485759\n\nCommand (m for help): p\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048    10485759     5241856   83  Linux\n\nCommand (m for help): w\nThe partition table has been altered!\n\nCalling ioctl() to re-read partition table.\n\nWARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 16: Device or resource busy.\nThe kernel still uses the old table.

Thank you :D\n\nA: FAT32 and NTFS are both file systems. Each file system has its own way for storing and retrieving data.\nWindows can use FAT (FAT*), exFAT and NTFS, where NTFS is the default.\nLinux can use ext (ext*), ZFS, ReiserFS, btrfs and a lot more, including every file system Windows can use, where ext* is the default (usually ext3 or ext4).\nSo, if you want to be able to share data between Windows and Linux, you should choose a file system both operating systems can use. I suggest NTFS, as FAT and exFAT have their limits.\nHowever, you cannot install Linux on a NTFS partition, so you should create a seperate system partition (ext*) to install Linux on.\n\nYou'll have to resize partitions in order to create a new partition (for Linux), because you're already using your whole disk for Windows (NTFS).\nThis may cause data corruption, so please make a backup of your important files before you do this, or make an image of your whole hard drive.\n\nA: Wikipedia - In computing, a file system (or filesystem) is used to control how data is stored and retrieved. Without a file system, information placed in a storage area would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of information stops and the next begins.\n\n\n*\n\n*NTFS -> New Technology File System\n\n*FAT32 -> File Allocation Table\n\n\nNTFS is newer File System by Microsoft and replacement to FAT32. One of the major drawback of FAT32 is that you cannot have a file of size greater than 4 GB.\nLinux uses ext4 file system. Linux can only be installed on ext4 and Newer windows like 7,8 & Vista can be installed only on NTFS (maybe also on FAT32). You can access Windows NTFS & FAT32 partition from ubuntu but you cannot access ext4 from windows (Microsoft does not support ext4)\nTo access sda2 in Ubuntu open a terminal and enter following commands\nsudo mkdir /mnt/sda2\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2\n\nthen you can access+modify sda2 from /mnt/sda2\n", "Q: How to change a share folders name I'm pretty new to ubuntu and I've been following lots of videos on YouTube however, I've come across a small problem.

The ordering of shell extension widgets appears to be random, how can I change it? I want to have the date/time information at the left for example.\nMy shell panel:\n\n\nA: Common way:\nTo begin with you have to find the according file of the extension you want to change.\nYou can usually find it here: ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions.\nIf the extension has been installed via package manager you can find it here: /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/(Thanks to A.B.)\nThen go into the extension's directory and open \"extension.js\" with any text editor. \nGo to the line with: function enable() (use the search function in your editor - if you can't find it go to the Update section further down).\nInside this function usually is a line Main.panel.addToStatusArea('NAME', _OTHERNAME, NUMBER, LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT); (Again: If you can't find it go to Update). It could happen that the last two parameters (NUMBER and POSITION) are missing; looks like this: Main.panel.addToStatusArea('NAME', _OTHERNAME);\n(Don't worry! Your computer interprets the shorter version with: ('NAME', _OTHERNAME, 0, right); Feel free to add the missing parameters. But always in the shown order!!!)\nThe POSITION defines where on the panel the icon should be. There are three areas: left, center and right. You probably don't want to change this value but feel free to do so. Here are the three possible states for POSITION on the panel:\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nActivities                 Date                        Other icons\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n   left                   center                          right \n\nThe more important value you probably want to change is NUMBER. It defines the order of the icons inside the sub-panels. Possible values are:\n\n\n*\n\n*0: I don't care where the icon is.\n\n*negative values: position; starting from the right side (could be important as all extension icons are loaded after the system icons)\n\n*positive values: position; starting from the left side. Higher values will be located further to the right side.\nYou have to play around with those values in all of your extensions because same values conflict with each other (two different extensions on position 2 doesn't make any sense). And sometimes even following values conflict.\nEvery time you change the value make sure to save the file. Then hit Alt+F2, type r and Enter. The panel will refresh with the newly ordered icons. This is a fast option to play around with those values.\n\nLastly a cite from Mathematical Coffee:\n\nUse Main.panel.addToStatusArea(unique_name_of_indicator, inidicator, position, box) to add a SystemStatusButton or PanelButton to the panel. This handles adding its menu to the menu manager for you (box is Main.panel._{left, right, center}Box, omitting the box argument gives right box by default, and ommitting position gives position 0). If your button is a ButtonBox only (i.e. no menu) then stick with. _{left, right, center}Box.insert_child_at_index.\n\nPlease let me know if you had any problems with this approach.\n\nUpdate:\nI have looked around and I recognised that this way doesn't work for all extensions (mostly just for simple/new extensions). A frequently used extension in this case is \"system monitor\". The way of modifying the icons position should be (generally) the same (I haven't tested it. So make sure to create a backup file). But there are some differences for \"system monitor\":\n\n\n*\n\n*The function you have to search is called var enable = function (). So it might be better to search for the word enable in the file.\n\n*The place where the position of the icons is defined is called Main.panel._addToPanelBox('system-monitor', tray, 1, panel);. Changing the number should have the same effect as desribed above. In order to change the whole area you have two options: \n\n\n*\n\n*By changing the very same line to Main.panel._addToPanelBox('system-monitor', tray, 1, Main.panel._rightBox);(Note: The position in the settings menu of the extension won't work any more).\n\n*Or by changing the line let panel = Main.panel._rightBox; (again use the search function) to your desired position (_leftBox, _centerBox, _rightBox).\n (These steps can be applied to any other extension. But there will be slightly different names. But still: The common way was described in my firt attempt for this answer) \n\nThe whole procedure in a nutshell:\nSearch for the according file. Then search for enable inside this file. Then search for anything like Main.panel... and change the values (quite self-explaining).\n\nAnd finally I noticed that you mentioned the time panel. I found no good way to modify its position but here is something else:\nYou have \"system monitor\" installed. That's good :)\nOpen the according extension.js and change the word \"right\" to \"left\" in those two lines:\nMain.panel._addToPanelBox('dateMenu', dateMenu, -1, Main.panel._rightBox); and Main.panel._rightBox.insert_child_at_index(dateMenu.actor, -1);.\nFinally you have to check \"move clock\" in the settings of this extension. There you go! I haven't tested it but it should work. If not, write a comment :)\nAhh! Forgot to mention: Every time you change on of the values save the file and refresh the panel with Alt+F2 - type r - hit Enter. And make sure to create backup files!!! :D\n\nA: The Extend Panel Menu extension will let you sort indicators with the \"Tray offset\" feature and the Indicators tab. After installing the extension, go into the settings to tweak your indicators. Happy OCDing!\n\nA: There's also an easier way of just opening gnome-tweak-tool, browsing to the Extensions tab, then turning extensions off and on again. Doing this moves the icons to the left.\n", "Q: Upgrading 13.10 to 14.04 alongside a windows 7 installation I have dual boot on my laptop: - Windows 7 with Ubuntu 13.10 installed alongside.\nHow do I upgrade my ubuntu installation to 14.04 without affecting the Windows installation?\n\nA: If you are installing using a live USB, installing 14.04 in the 13.10 partition will not affect your windows.\nIf you are using this method (works also for 14.04 final) http://itsfoss.com/upgrade-ubuntu-1404-beta-1310/ It should also not affect your windows.

Also, 64-bit CPU's have backwards compatibility for 32-bit.\nRead more about 64-bit on Ubuntu's wiki for example.\nOne problem may be that you can't run all 32-bit programs on your 64-bit Ubuntu by default.

I have a netbook that I want to install Ubuntu onto.

See Get Ubuntu for download links\n\n\n\n*To ensure maximum compatibility with Apple hardware, first blank and reformat the USB stick using Apple's \"Disk Utility\", but this step can be skipped if you intend to use the USB stick with only generic PC hardware.\n\n*\n\n*Launch Disk Utility from Applications -> Utilities or Spotlight search.\n\n\n*Insert your USB stick and observe the new device added to Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Select the USB stick device (you may need to enable the option View -> Show All Devices) and select Erase from the toolbar (or right-click menu).\n\n\n*Set the format to MS-DOS (FAT) and the scheme to GUID Partition Map.\n\n\n*Check you've chosen the correct device and click Erase.\n\nWarning: Disk Utility needs to be used with caution as selecting the wrong device or partition can result in data loss.\n\n\n*Install and run Etcher\nTo write the ISO file to the USB stick, use a free and open source application called Etcher. After downloading this and clicking to mount the package, Etcher can either be run in place or dragged into your Applications folder.\nBy default, recent versions of macOS block the running of applications from unidentified developers. To side-step this issue, enable App Store and identified developers in the Security & Privacy pane of System Preferences. If you are still warned against running the application, click Open Anyway in the same pane.\n\n\n\n*Etcher configuration\nEtcher will configure and write to your USB device in three stages, each of which needs to be selected in turn:\n\n*\n\n*Select image will open a file requester from which should navigate to and select the ISO file downloaded previously. By default, the ISO file will be in your Downloads folder.\n\n\n*Select drive, replaced by the name of your USB device if one is already attached, lets you select your target device. You will be warned if the storage space is too small for your selected ISO.\n\n\n*Flash! will activate when both the image and the drive have been selected. As with Disk Utility, Etcher needs low-level access to your storage hardware and will ask for your password after selection.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n*Write to device\nAfter entering your password, Etcher will start writing the ISO file to your USB device.\nThe Flash stage of the process will show progress, writing speed and an estimated duration until completion. This will be followed by a validation stage that will ensure the contents of the USB device are identical to the source image.\nWhen everything has finished, Etcher will declare the process a success.\nCongratulations! You now have Ubuntu on a USB stick, bootable and ready to go.\n\nWarning: After the write process has completed, macOS may inform you that 'The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer'. Don't select Initialize. Instead, select Eject and remove the USB device.\n\n\n*Boot your Mac\nIf you want to use your USB stick with an Apple Mac, you will need to restart or power-on the Mac with the USB stick inserted while the Option/alt ⌥ key is pressed.\nThis will launch Apple's 'Startup Manager' which shows bootable devices connected to the machine.

However, you can use gparted on the live cd or install it and using it after the install to do what you are wanting to do.

Please remember to back up any critical files or data you may need as well as keep records of the settings you change. Doing so will help you recover in the event of a disaster. Keep in mind that you perform these configuration “tweaks” at your own risk.\nThese configuration tweaks are completed by entering commands into your “Terminal”. We will use Gedit although you can use Vi, nano, etc.\nAs a side note, if you do not want to enter “sudo” for each command, just begining your terminal session with this command:\nsudo su\nIPV6 is an Internet protocol. Currently most applications use IPV4 and this can cause conflicts which slow down your system.\nComplete the following to disable it.\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/bad_list\nand type this in:\nalias net-pf-10 off\nThen save the file.\nSpeed up Broadband Internet by editing the appropriate configuration file and adding the following information. – Or, you can use a tool called PowerTweak from here: sourceforge.net/projects/powertweak\nsudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\nThe first four line deal with window size and you need to enter numbers that are best for you (because these ones may be too high). Here is what I mean by this:\nComputers communicate by sending packets of data back and forth. When they connect with each other to send these packets they use the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).\nYour computer could begin the connection with a small package size, then the other computer might respond with a larger one. In turn your computer will reduce (scale down) the size of the package (to a bit more that your original package size). The other computer again responds with a larger packet size. This cycle continues until your computer or the responding computer meets their maximum package size.\nIf you choose a windows packet size that is too big, you will notice slower broadband performance (524288 works for me). If you notice a slow down, then reduce your window size.\nThe largest size you can use is 65536, however these are the three settings that seem to work best:\n524288\n262144\n131072\nWhich are all multiples of 1024 (or 1K).\nNow add the following to the end of the file:\nnet.core.rmem_default = 524288\nnet.core.rmem_max = 524288\nnet.core.wmem_default = 524288\nnet.core.wmem_max = 524288\nnet.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 87380 524288\nnet.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 524288\nnet.ipv4.tcp_mem = 524288 524288 524288\nnet.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337 = 1\nnet.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc = 0\nnet.ipv4.tcp_sack = 1\nnet.ipv4.tcp_fack = 1\nnet.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1\nnet.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 1\nnet.ipv4.tcp_ecn = 0\nnet.ipv4.route.flush = 1\nAfter adding these line you do not need to reboot, instead just reset the file by issuing this command:\nsudo sysctl -p\nAfter completing this, you should notice improved web surfing speed. If not, remember to go back and adjust your TCP window size and try again.\n", "Q: Removing Ubuntu 14.04 and re-install 12.04? I just upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS from 12.04 LTS and realised that it is simply not right for this particular computer (I do still plan to use 14.04 with my newer machines).  I wish to completely remove ver. 14.04 and replace it with 12.04... no roll-back or anything necessary. Happy just to restore/fresh reinstall 12.04 just as it was. \nI am even using the exact same DVD that I used to install 12.04 originally when I sucessfully switched from Windows. When I try to boot from the DVD, it just seems to go no further than the screen that shows the word Ubuntu and the series of red dots below it (lighting in succession) to indicate \"progress\". Only thing is.. the led light on the CD/DVD-Rom drive stops flickering after a minute or two, as though it is no longer being read. For a long time.\nThe computer does not freeze, but is otherwise unresponsive. Could it be that it will just take a very long time to begin the process of (re)installing 12.04 (like \"overnight\" long) and we should be more patient - or am I simply going about this the wrong way? \nAny advice, including the correct/conventional way to \"downgrade\" a version of Ubuntu would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you.\n\nA: I would open the tray and reboot, preferably with alt-ctrl-del if possible. It should not take that long to load. But, if you have unlimit data, or even the .iso on a PC, you might want to try a fresh dvd, if that one shows signs of wear. I would completely understand if your on a machine with Rambus or something, but if you had it on your system, your system should be capable of loading the cd in a timely fashion.\ngetting a .iso of Precise can be done from:\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/\nand it's the latest, so less time doing updates after install.\n\nA: I just did this the other day on my Girlfriend's laptop. I had to uninstall 14.04 LTS because her usb wireless adpater ALFA AWUS036 was extremely slow (I suspected a driver problem). I put in a whole day trying to get it to work, but no dice. I'm thinking something is up with the Linux 3.13 Kernel. Anyways, I manged to so snag an .iso from http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ and from there I plugged in a 2GB USB Flash Drive and used Startup Disk Creator to make a Bootable USB Drive. From there it was just a matter of booting the usb key and re installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS again. \n\nA: You can reinstall ubuntu 12.04 by rebooting and press F3 to go to the boot option. \nEnter 'C' to go to the command prompt and type \"coreboot_boottime\".

How would I find the source code? I just found out about /bin/true yesterday. I'm not a bash power user by any means, but I decided to check it out. I was surprised to find that it is a 22K file (Ubuntu 12.04), and not one of the smallest utilities in /bin (e.g. kill is smaller). This is really just curiosity, but is there are reason for it not to be a very small bit of code? How would I go about finding the source code for /bin/true?\n\nA: Well, looking into the sources of the coreutils tools, true is one of the smallest. It is smaller than kill, though larger than false which is the very smallest:\n$ for i in src/*c; do wc -l $i; done | sort -nr | tail -11\n78 src/true.c\n74 src/operand2sig.c\n73 src/sync.c\n37 src/prog-fprintf.c\n2 src/uname-uname.c\n2 src/uname-arch.c\n2 src/ls-vdir.c\n2 src/ls-ls.c\n2 src/ls-dir.c\n2 src/lbracket.c\n2 src/false.c\n\nSo, true has 78 lines, but only 58 of them are actually code (the rest are blank lines and comments):\n$ grep . src/true.c | awk '{ if(/\\/\\*/){a=0} if(a){print} if(/\\*\\//){a=1}}' | wc\n50\n\nAnd yes, a lot of that (10 lines) are dedicated to the usage function. The program is still tiny though.\nAlso, the reason that false is tinier is that it simply calls true:\n$ cat src/false.c\n#define EXIT_STATUS EXIT_FAILURE\n#include \"true.c\"\n\n\nA: $ dpkg -S /bin/true\ncoreutils: /bin/true\n\nSo the package which actually provides /bin/true file is coreutils.\nRun the below command to download the source code of coreutils,\napt-get source coreutils\n\n\nA: true is part of the GNU coreutils.

I keep getting tripped up trying to close the music player.\nI feel silly posting on something that has been raged about like this, but I can't find a way to change it.  By now, I thought someone would have made a plugin for it.\n\nA: Close-on-Hide External Plugin\nWell, I took up the challenge and wrote an external plugin that does just this - clicking the close button (window \"x\" button) really does mean quit.\nIn the default way of working, Ubuntu has a specific patch to ensure that when music is playing, clicking the close button minimizes the application.\nThe reason for this is that some people like music to be playing, but they don't actually want to see the application visibly on the desktop.  Control of rhythmbox then passes to the Sound Indicator.\nHowever, for those that do not like this behaviour, you cannot by default quit the application via the close button when something is playing.\nhow to install for RB3.0 and later\nsudo apt-get install git\ncd ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins\ngit clone https://github.com/fossfreedom/close-on-hide\n\nStart rhythmbox and enable the \"close-on-hide\" plugin in the plugins menu (Tools - Plugins menu)\nIf you are using RB2.99 and earlier - edit the .plugin file in the close-on-hide folder and change the line Loader=python3 to read Loader=python\n\nA: The default, only behavior with Rhythmbox is to 'hide in the background' when you hit the 'x'.\nTo work around this you need to \"Quit\" Rhythmbox by going to File -> Quit in the menu, or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Q.\nThat will actually kill the application.\nYou're not the only one;  Many have complained about this in the past.\n\nA: To add to fossfreedom's answer (since I can't comment on it because of lack of reputation) for Ubuntu 20 the directory for plugins seems to be /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins now.\nsudo apt-get install git\ncd /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins\ngit clone https://github.com/fossfreedom/close-on-hide\n\nWorked for me.\n\nA: In ubuntu 14.04 I have to open a terminal window while the rhythmbox window is still visible and type:\nxkill\n\nHit enter and move the mouse cursor which has now turned into an X, over the rhythmbox window and click.

Apport will open your default browser and send you to the launchpad site where the bug was reported.

You can log in with the same credentials as you're using for SSH.\nBut I wouldn't enable remote logins for root on your server. The root user can do anything on your server so if you get hacked while remote root logins are enabled anything can happen.\nI suggest you just set a password for the www-data user (this is the user that runs Apache2, set a password using passwd www-data) and make www-data the owner of /var/www (chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www).\nNow log in with the www-data user and the password you just set (I recommend you to use SFTP instead of FTP as it's more secure) and you should be able to upload your files to /var/www.\nNote: You can use a plugin for Eclipse to automatically sync your files with your server using SFTP.\n\nA: The interest of application softwares such as Bluefish, Filezilla, WinCp (on Windows) ... is to deal with a remote server.\nIn your case, it is better to run your above command (sudo cp source destination).\nBut in both cases, using a software or a terminal command line, your files privileges depend only on how you chmod them (they are not inherent to the software you are using).\nIf you want to use Eclipse only, without any other software or command line to gain root privileges over your files, you can create symbolic links to your sources using Eclipse itself.

Please make suggestions simple and in plain talk. Thank you.\n\nA: The Kubuntu download is an ISO file, which you can download here.\nYou've to burn this file to a DVD (using ImgBurn for example) or put it on an USB drive (using Rufus for example). You cannot just copy the ISO file itself to a DVD or USB drive, this way your DVD or USB drive won't be bootable.\nThen you have to start your pc from the bootable DVD or USB drive you've just created. Click here for a tutorial about booting from DVD or USB drive.\nWhen you've booted your Kubuntu ISO you'll see Kubuntu's graphical installer and you can just follow the on-screen instructions.\nNote: some older PCs don't support booting from USB drives. Sometimes it's not enabled in your BIOS and you can just enable it there (look for Legacy USB Support or something like that).

I installed Ubuntu 14.04 and the current Android development SDK, which contains 32-bit executables. I found that I cannot run those 32-bit binaries.

If you install build-essential package, you will have ldd command available. This command ldd ./adb | grep not will show you what libraries are missing. Just install these libraries in i386 arch with apt. Like this: apt-get install libmissing:i386\nBeware, some buggy packages will try to delete 64bit version firs.\n\nA: Just an addition to Zanna:\nThe following has solved the android studio problem of \"unable to install libraries\":\nsudo apt-get install libdb1-compact tzdata initscripts\n\nThis replaces missing library libstdc++6-i386 which is probably because the package has been obsoleted. Not sure why this specific library was important.\n", "Q: Enable external boot devices in UEFI I own an HP Pavilion 5 Notebook which came pre installed with Windows 8. I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my system via a LIVEUSB. But my system doesn't detect the LiveUSB during boot. My boot order is proper, with external USB in the first place, but the system just boots into Windows directly.\nAlso I observed that when I turn on Legacy mode, the USB is detected. But then I have to install Ubuntu in CSM mode instead of EFI, which causes boot problems later on.\nIs there a way to detect my external boot options in UEFI as well? \nP.S. Secure Boot was disabled during the booting. The tool used for creating the LiveUSB was YUMI Multiboot installer available at pendrivelinux.com.\n\nA: It's likely that YUMI is creating a USB drive that's not bootable in EFI mode. In my experience, the most reliable way to create a bootable Ubuntu USB drive is with dd, as in sudo dd if=imagefile.iso of=/dev/sdc (changing imagefile.iso and /dev/sdc as appropriate for your file and system). If you don't have a working Linux installation, there are Windows ports of dd, and other tools that do the same thing -- basically a raw copy of the file to the disk.\nIf that fails, I recommend you check your firmware for options called \"fast boot,\" \"quick startup,\" or the like. Such options work by skipping certain system initialization steps, which often renders the computer unable to see USB flash drives until after an OS has booted. Disabling such an option in the firmware may render the USB flash drive bootable again.\n", "Q: How to solve LOCALE problem I am facing a problem as asked in this question, I have tried the proposed solution but facing the same issue\nWhen I run locale,\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n\nWhen I run \nsudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8\n\nI get this error\nsudo: unable to resolve host ubuntu\n/bin/bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)\nGenerating locales...\nen_US.UTF-8... /usr/sbin/locale-gen: line 177: warning: setlocale: \nLC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)\n/usr/sbin/locale-gen: line 243: \n8925 Killed localedef $no_archive -i $input -c -f $charset $locale_alias\n$locale failed\nGeneration complete.\n\nI am running Ubuntu Cloud Image on OpenStack cloud\n\nA: The problem is due to this bug. The cloud images only support \"en_US.UTF-8\" so you have to make sure that the host server (the install of Ubuntu Server which you use to SSH into the cloud install) is configured to use \"en_US.UTF-8\"\nTo do this generate the \"en_US.UTF-8\" on the Ubuntu server install:\n$ sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8\nGenerating locales...\n  en_US.UTF-8... done\nGeneration complete.\n\n$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales\nGenerating locales...\n  en_US.UTF-8... done\nGeneration complete.\n\nUse the newly generated locale on the Ubuntu Server install by editing /etc/default/locale to contain only this line:\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\nReboot and then access the cloud install.\nEdit:\nPeople with a similar problem have had good luck editing (or creating) /etc/environment to contain:\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\n... as well.\n\nA: I managed to solve the problem.

Can someone advise me of how to add borders (wide borders) to Windows in Ubuntu version 14.04.  In the past I have used \"gnome-tweak-tool\".  However it doesn't work with version 14.04.\nAll my windows (especially the many terminal screens I work with) appear to blend as one.  It's very hard to tell where one window begin and another end.\nAlso the title bars are very hard to distinguish between which window is active and with window is inactive.\nThanks in advance for anyone who has a solution of how to customize these Windows (or how to make gnome-tweak-tool work with Ubuntu 14.04).\nI tryed activating the Window Decorator feature of CCSM but using that disabled Unity and made the environment unusable.\n\nAll about tweaking the Windows in Ubuntu 14.04... setting border width, color, title, etc.\n\nA: 17.10\nfragfutter's answer worked for me!\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a file ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\n\n*Add the lines:\ndecoration {\n  border: 1px solid gray;\n  background: gray;\n}\n\n*Reboot (or you could probably just log out and back in to gnome)\nEarlier versions of Ubuntu\nHere is a shell-script version of my favorite part of L. D. James's excellent answer:\n17.04 uses gtk-3.20\nsudo sed -i -e \\\n's/-UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 0 0 0;/-UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 2 2 2;/' \\\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.20/apps/unity.css\n\n16.04 and 15.10 use gtk-3.0\nsudo sed -i -e \\\n's/-UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 0 0 0;/-UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 2 2 2;/' \\\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css\n\nYou'll have to log out, then log back in to see the results of this change.  You can replace Ambiance (the default) with Radiance or whatever theme you're currently using.\nHow does it work?\nsed is a command line utility that replaces text.\nEnding a line with \\ tells the shell that the command continues on the next line (for human readability).\n-i tells sed to edit the file in-place (don't make a new file).\n-e tells sed that what follows is the sed script (instead of reading it from a file).\ns/.../.../ the s means to substitute what's between the first two slashes with what's between the second two slashes.  It only makes one substitution (because there is no /g at the end).\n\nA: I appreciate the work around provided by the first answer.  However, I was very specifically looking for a method of using the actually components as provided by the distribution if it exists.\nAt present you can copy your favorite theme from /usr/share/theme to ~/.theme.  Name the theme folder something different from what it was named in the /usr/share/theme.  This way when you select your chosen them you'll find it by the name you called the folder.\nExample:\n$ cp -R /usr/share/themes/Radiance/ ~/.themes/MyRadiance\n\nThis is a per-user operation and doesn't require elevated access.\nNow you can edit the gtk-3 folder of that new directory to make your borders any way you want them.  You can also customize other components of the theme.\nThe borders can be resized by editing the UnityDecoration features of the unity.css file located in the apps folder:\n~/.themes/MyRadiance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css\n\nTo change the borders change the 0's to a different number of the parameter:\n-UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 0 0 0;\n\nYou'll find many other editible features in the gtk-3.x folder.\nFor other features of the borders such as color, text, etc... take a look at Unity/Theming at:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/Theming\nI appreciate the previous workaround.  But I hope many can benefit from using the feature as distributed by the OS developers.\nOh yea, to use this newly edited theme you'll have to install the unity tweak tool.\n$ sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nNote:\nI already linked this question to a similar question about Ambiance configuration.  This resolution can easily be applied to any modern Ubuntu theme... not just Ambiance (or the Radiance reference mentioned in this particular instance).\n\nA: Here is How to do it!!!\nFirst Pop that terminal up! and type this in.\nthis should get a older version of the theme use in 13.10\nwget http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/ubuntu/pool/main/u/ubuntu-themes/light-themes_13.04+13.10.20131014-0ubuntu1_all.deb\n\nThis should remove the current version of the theme.\nsudo apt-get purge light-themes\n\nThis should allow it to download inside of your download folder if you wanted to keep it.\ncd ~/Downloads\n\nThis should install the older version of the theme, that did use the borders.\nsudo dpkg -i light-themes_13.04+13.10.20131014-0ubuntu1_all.deb\n\nThis sould delect the .deb file if you wanted to.\nrm light-themes_13.04+13.10.20131014-0ubuntu1_all.deb\n\nIf that link is dead click here to see more!\n\nA: For 20.04:\nsudo nano ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\n\nThen add/replace this code for decoration.

I went for \"try...\" and once the desktop showed up\n  from where I then installed Trusty 64bit.\nIt goes without saying that the boot options in grub are set to\n  nomodeset, but at least the notebook is working. WLAN is ok. I reach\n  speeds up to 780 MBit/s. There remain several issues though: display\n  brightness buttons are not functional, fingerprint reader is not\n  detected, and the proprietary nvidia driver is something that will\n  maybe work properly some day.\n\nEdit: once you install using the \"nomodeset\", edit the file /etc/default/grub and remove the option \"nomodeset\". Then open \"Additional Drivers\" and install the nvidia driver. This allows the brightness buttons to work fine.\nDid you try the nomodeset boot parameter?\nAnd instructions for installing Nvidia Prime:\n\nUpdate: the instructions below should work under Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty\n  Tahr too.\nNote: the  nvidia-prime package only supports the proprietary Nvidia\n  drivers and won't work with Nouveau!\nIf you're using Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander or 14.04 Trusty Tahr and\n  want to test the Optimus support in the Nvidia Graphics Drivers\n  319.12+, here's what you need to do:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Firstly, purge Bumblebee if installed:\n  \n  \n  sudo apt-get purge bumblebee*\nAlso, make sure libvdpau-va-gl1 is not enabled system-wide because it\n  causes Nvidia Settings to crash on start - if it is, either disable it\n  or simply remove the package:\nsudo apt-get purge libvdpau-va-gl1\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Install the proprietary Nvidia drivers and the Nvidia Prime package:\n  \n  \n  sudo apt-get install nvidia-319 nvidia-settings-319 nvidia-prime\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Reboot the system.\n  \n  \n  That's it, after a reboot, your laptop should be using the Nvidia GPU\n  to render the desktop.\n\n\nA: Not the answer you need but I run 64-bit Ubuntu desktop on Lenovo Thinkpad X121e. It is a terribly slow laptop and I gave up trying to run Windows 7 on it.\nExcept for speed and lack of CD/DVD player I have no issues.\nI started using 12.04 LTS and have upgraded to 14.04 LTS\n\nA: My Lenovo T440p has just arrived in my house. And this Laptop use UEFI and a secure boot to prevent some security problems. I have installed the latest Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit version just to assure you that the installation is possible. I don't know if you could install Ubuntu 12.04 as for me, it does not support the UEFI frame.\nif you windows 8 have 4 partions like me, you could proceed the installation like me.\n1 Disable in BIOS the Secure Boot. And shrink some space for Ubuntu, do not format it.\n2 Make a U disk boot version of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with the help of UltraISO for example.\n3 Change the order of boot by taken first the U disk, and proceed the process of installation. if you chose the NVidia GT730M like me, maybe you should modify the first item during U disk boot:\nclick 'e' to edit the command line for Install Ubuntu when you run into the \nTry Ubuntu ....\ninstall Ubuntu\nWindows 8 boot loader ...\nand change the \"quiet splash\" to \"nomodeset\" \n(do not type the quote mark). To prevent the black waiting screen . LOL. Click Ctrl + x to proceed.\n4 You can enjoy the environment of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. But, for me, there is still some problem with the shutdown option, Ubuntu can not shut down correctly due to some Wifi driver (Intel things).\nRegards\n\nA: I'm also experiencing problems with the T440p.\nFor what concernes the optimus bug, see\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1268669\n\nA: I've a T420 and I hope most of its configurations might be same as your T440p. I'm also having some issues to get the optimus to work and presently settled for using laptop in discrete(pure nvidia) graphics mode(enable/disable from BIOS) with nvidia's 331.38 version of the driver. For installation use nomodset as suggested above.\nHope this will get your laptop working.\n\nA: I am able to install Ubuntu 12.04.4 desktop 64-bit on my Lenovo t440p (with SSD) from a USB stick without any BIOS downgrade. After a clean install, the wireless will not work immediately, but it works after you find a ethernet cable to do apt-get update/upgrade:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIt might worth a try if you are still finding a solution. \nIn addition, I can somehow install the later versions (\"12.04.5\" or \"14.04.1\") via various tricks I found online, but the system becomes extremely unstable ... Just my 2 cents.\n", "Q: After upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04 samba has big issues The server has been running very stable with 12.04 LTS for years but after upgrading to 14.04 LTS a encountered huge samba issues.\nDirectly after upgrade the mapping from Windows was toggling but there was a samba fix next day correcting this. It has run fine for weeks but after the last updates it doesn't work at all.\nYesterday I even tried to remove and reinstall samba without success.\nHave read the other threads but it doesnt help me.\nEverything looks fine in Webmin 1.680. Users and shares exists. I reentered the passwords but I cannot map any network drive from Windows anymore.\nSystem error 53 has occurred.\nThe network path was not found.\nIt is no DNS issue. I get the same error when using IP-address.\nHTTP, SSH and ping works fine with host name.\n\nA: I have the issue too with the latest UBUNTU 14.04.\nEach time the samba share was broken, I have to manually reimport the users by using smbpasswd  -a.\nWhy this issue was not solved till now during the long alpha/beta testing?\n\nA: I also have problems with 14.04 as a samba client.  If I try to keep open a file share from a windows xp host on an ubuntu 14.04 client, the share window becomes unresponsive after a period of inactivity, especially if I have switched to a different workspace.  I can no longer keep documents open across the share or browse directories across the share if I do anything else for a few minutes.  Nautilus errors out and fails, nemo and thunar will turn grey for 15-20 seconds and then start working again.  I never had this problem with ubuntu 10.04 or 12.04.  I still have 1 12.04 machine on my network that works normally.  All my 14.04 machines exhibit this problem.\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 Extremely slow login AFTER logout I have just clean-installed ubuntu 14.04 + gnome 3.10 (the system is 32 bits since my laptop is just a HP G72 with 3GB of ram). I've also moved back some users data (.thunderbird, some docs, music and photos). By the way: there are two users (both admin - but my wife doesn't fiddle with sudo for sure).\nEverything seems to be fine IF ONLY we log in after reboot / start. It takes no longer than 10 secs from entering the password to desktop, which is fine for a laptop some years old.\nHowever, after having logged out (same happens for both users) it is extremely slow to log back again (or login to the other account). I tried (over and over again) to measure the time, but useally after 3 minutes I just go to a console, login as the \"stuck\" user and \"kill -9 -1\". After that, login time is fine again. Of couse until I log out...\nAs a temporary workaround I have \n\n\n*\n\n*replaced .bash.logout with kill -9 -1\n\n*added rm -rf ~/.cache/ to /etc/rc.local\nIt helped, a bit at least. Now re-login lasts a minute or so (not several minutes)\nStill, it is not much of a comprehensive solution.\n\nA: Finally, I believe that my problems were due to tracker acting up. I disabled it following the dconf-editor advice found at:\ntracker-store and tracker-miner-fs eating up my CPU on every startup\n", "Q: Change default system font using terminal only in 14.04 The following question answers how to Adjust fonts using tweak tool but the luddite in me would like to know how to do this without installing unity-tweak-tool. \nHow can I adjust the default system font from a terminal.\n\nA: Recent updates have been changing the font scaling factors on my system, reset them with this command...\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface text-scaling-factor '1.0'\n\n\nA: \ngsettings offers a simple commandline interface to GSettings.

How can I do that? Should I create a partition with G Parted for Win7? Need advice from someone who did this successfully. \n\nA: Yes, you have to create a separate ntfs partition for Windows and it should be a Primary one(if your disk has MBR partition table) through gparted.\nRun Windows installation disk and select custom option to install Windows on created ntfs partition. \nTo create a separate ntfs partition from /dev/sda1\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Ubuntu installation disk and click on try Ubuntu option on startup.\n\n*Open gparted partition editor from dash.

So again back to Try Ubuntu and type this on terminal: \n sudo mount /dev/sda1 /boot \n sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install grub-pc \n sudo grub-install /dev/sda \n sudo umount /boot. \n\nIt didn't worked perfectly, but this tutorial saved me.

Then I recompiled all my C programs. Now all these programs output a warning which was not there before, when I had these programs running under Xubuntu 13.1 with the old libgtk-3-dev. The warning is\n** (program.x:2430): WARNING **: Couldn't connect to accessibility bus: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-DpOEDwyIbh: Connection refused\n\nHow can one suppress this message?\n\nA: Apparently this happens only if Xubuntu is freshly installed.\nIn Settings Manager one can enable accessibility, reboot, disable accessibilty, and reboot. Then this warning is permanently gone. It seems to be a miracle designed to bewilder innocent C programmers when they install Xubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: I have the similar problem.\n   It is fresh installed Xubuntu (ubuntu with xfce).\n   And camera (webcam of DELL Latitude E6430) did not work anywhere: not in 'cheese', not in 'guvc' ('guvcview'), not in 'Google Hangout', not in '', not in '', \nAs i guessed, libgtk-3-dev was absent...\n   This helped:\nsudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev\n\nAfter this 'cheese' started to work. \n   But 'guvcview' still gives error:\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\n", "Q: Intermittent crontab problem My crontab entry intermittently fails to find scripts in my user's home directory.  The crontab entries run exactly on schedule as specified, and occasionally the script runs correctly, but mostly it only produces output like this:\n/bin/sh: 1: /home/<user>/script/check_cgi.pl: not found\n\nThe crontab entry for this is:\n5,35 * * * *    /home/<user>/scripts/check_cgi.pl >>/tmp/check_cgi.pl.out 2>&1\n\nI have double-checked that the script exists, and that root can see the filesystem and that the command runs correctly if I sudo to root.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to why cron would frequently not be able to find a file and how to solve it?\nEDIT\nThis is root's crontab (edited by sudo crontab -e), hence the relevance of checking that root can see the script.\nThe permissions on the script are:\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 <user> <user>  700 Apr 20 09:27 check_cgi.pl\n\nand the directory permissions 775 or 755 too, so there is no problem with root having permissions to execute the script.\nIt seems that cron started to \"find\" the script after I added a new cron job to run \"find /\"; as if forcing cron to go through the entire directory tree allowed it to \"find\" the script again.\nThere are 4 scripts, which are all contained in the same directory.  They run at various times (every 15 mins, every 30 mins, once per day) and they all have this problem at the same time.  And then when the problem goes, they all work ok.\nEDIT 2\nI have found the problem... By running each hour the cron job \"ll -lR /home\", I discovered that around 15.00 it started to incorrectly report the contents of the /home/ directory.  Instead of the correct collection of directories (including the required scripts directory), it showed the completely different contents :\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 <user> <user> 56 Jan 18 20:53 Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop -> /usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-private.desktop\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 <user> <user> 52 Jan 18 20:53 README.txt -> /usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-private.txt\n\nAnd when I view the /usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-private.txt file, it tells me:\nTHIS DIRECTORY HAS BEEN UNMOUNTED TO PROTECT YOUR DATA.\nFrom the graphical desktop, click on:\n \"Access Your Private Data\"\nor\nFrom the command line, run:\n ecryptfs-mount-private\n\nSo that appears to be the answer.  The home directory is set up as an encrypted filesystem and the operating system unmounts it in periods of low use \"to protect your data\".\nI just need to work out how to disable this behaviour either permanently or when the cron jobs run.  I guess the answer is within ecryptfs-mount-private...\n\nA: The ubuntu help describes this problem https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome\nCaveats\nThere are a few minor caveats that one must keep in mind about these encrypted configurations.\nWhen you are not logged into your system, data in your home directory is not accessible in plain text. This, of course, is by design. This is what keeps an attacker from gaining access to your files. However, this means that:\n1.    Your cronjobs may not have access to your Home Directory \n\nThe solution is, I think, not to have encrypted home directories, or move the files to somewhere that root can see (like root's home directory).\n\nA: It's weird the script runs well occasionally.\nBut, in my experience, most of the problems related crontab is a privilege.\ncrontab runs the script with it's own privilege, not root.\nTherefore, how about \"chmod 707\" or \"777\" to your script and your user's folder??\n", "Q: Revert Erlang OTP Version I have upgraded my ubuntu to latest version.

Is this something due to some omission in the dependency list of apache installation?\nHopefully it was ok to install the package in the first place.\nThe maas-pserv does not start and I don't know due to which cause. I tried to look into the log files in /var/log/maas, but pserv does not write any log file, maybe since the crash is created by upstart. I tried to start pserv manually through the twistd call as in /etc/init/maas-pserv.conf. twisted complains that it does not know the command maas-pserv.\nBy no means I'm a python expert, but I only can imagine (educated guess) that twisted is not importing the maas python application library and therefore complains about not knowing about it.\nAn ideas why maas-pserv is crashing?\n\nA: For the maas-pserv problem i've maybe a solution. I had the issue today also on one of my MAAS controllers and i found out that twistd has a cache file that contains all plugin information.\nI simply deleted the dropin.cache file and twistd will find the maas-pserv now.\ndropin.cache is located on /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twisted/plugins at my machines.\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 / 64 bit stucks while using it newbie here!!!\nso guys I’m running Ubuntu 14.04 and everything was perfect before i begun to get stuck while using it, several times, the systems just stop and nothing is working!every time i need to press the power off button to shutdown the systems and power it on again, and I’m losing a lot of things can any one tell me what to do??? thanks in advance\nwhen it stuck it looks like this:\n\n\n\nA: I see this at times too, but I usually don't restart the system, rather I just hit Ctrl+Alt+F1-F6 and move to the command line.

It does this by looking for to ... and from ... instances and only uses the ones where it was a to ttyUSB* at the end of the line.\ndmesg | tac | awk '$NF~/ttyUSB[0-9]+/ && !a[$NF]++ && $(NF-1)==\"to\" {print $NF}'\n\nTo quickly explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*tac reverses the input so we're dealing with the most recent first\n\n*$NF ~ /ttyUSB[0-9]+/ is a regex that checks the last field is a ttyUSB*\n\n*!a[$NF]++ checks that we haven't seen this field before\n\n*$(NF-1) == \"to\" filters on the penultimate field to make sure we're dealing with to ... lines.\n\n\nTo test this I've simply taken your output and have removed the second attach. In my example ttyUSB2 was connected, then disconnected and never reconnected. It shouldn't be available.\n$ cat testdmesg \n[    7.648896] usb 1-2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB0\n[    7.649091] usb 1-2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB1\n[    7.649502] usb 1-2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB2\n[17406.327030] option1 ttyUSB0: GSM modem (1-port) converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0\n[17406.329670] option1 ttyUSB1: GSM modem (1-port) converter now disconnected from ttyUSB1\n[17406.334036] option1 ttyUSB2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now disconnected from ttyUSB2\n[90128.405694] usb 1-4: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB0\n[90128.405987] usb 1-4: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB1\n[90132.905458] usb 1-2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB3\n[90132.905791] usb 1-2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB4\n[90132.906541] usb 1-2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB5\n[90148.661532] usb 1-1: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB6\n[90148.661828] usb 1-1: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB7\n[90148.662440] usb 1-1: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB8\n\n$ tac testdmesg | awk '$NF~/ttyUSB[0-9]+/ && !a[$NF]++ && $(NF-1)==\"to\" {print $NF}'\nttyUSB8\nttyUSB7\nttyUSB6\nttyUSB5\nttyUSB4\nttyUSB3\nttyUSB1\nttyUSB0\n\nAnd of course you can pass that through sort if you want.

Apart, of course, that one also gets Unity.\nIs there a best option for getting a pure Gnome experience?\nAndrew\n\nA: If you want a pure Gnome experience, then Ubuntu Gnome is better.\nIf you install Gnome Shell with regular Ubuntu, you will just have a choice between Unity and Gnome. You will end up with some Unity packages you don't really need. You will also end up with both GDM and LightDM.

FTP is not limited.\n\nA: Edit your sources file pointing to ftp instead of http\nUse following command to edit your configuration:\nsudoedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nIn most cases its enough to change http:// in every line to ftp:// but I would strongly encourage to make a backup copy of sources.list first. Also I would check is ftp connection available on your repository server. Simply get a URL from sources file, change http:// to ftp:// and paste into your web browser.\n\nA: To ensure that the upgrade will use the FTP protocol, you basically need to update your software sources to use a ftp mirror.\nTo do that the best approach is to use the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Software Center\n\n*Open the Edit -> Software Sources... menu\n\n*Select Others in the Download from list\n\n*Finally choose a mirror supporting the ftp ptotocol (it will update /etc/apt/sources.list automatically)\n\n\n\n\nA: I suspect you actually want to upgrade to 14.04, as that is the current release.\nNOTE: Year.Month = 2014.April == 14.04\nIt is Strongly Recommended that you should do a Full Install, rather than an upgrade, especially that you are moving to a Long Term Support release.\nThis actually makes things easier, as you can download the full install image via FTP: http://ftp.daum.net/ubuntu-releases/14.04/\nThere are other FTP Ubuntu download mirrors which can be found via your favorite search engine.\n", "Q: How to allow wine to access network shares?

But having to call the boot manager on each start is not quite a solution. \nSo, wondering where the 2 Ubuntu entries came from, I took a look at the boot menu in the BIOS and found this:\n\nSo as far as I understand it has something to do with GRUB and UEFI, but I don't know enough about any of it to put it all together... \nSo my question is: \nWhat's wrong here and how can I fix this? \nWhen I shut down Ubuntu, it hangs on the purple screen, with the dots blinking, but even after 10 minutes nothing happens, so I have to switch it off. Rebooting works as expected, though. \nDoes it have something to do with the problem above?\n\nA: You can set UEFI Boot to disabled to use legacy booting.\nIf you want to use UEFI you can try to disable Fast Boot, this solved the problem for me.\n\nA: I think you need to update and install grub freshly. Open the terminal and type\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub\n\nand this will install grub automatically to the required drives. \n", "Q: Dark GTK theme for Ubuntu 14.04 I am using the zonColor DarkNight theme on Ubuntu 13.10 and am quite pleased with it. I would like to have a similar theme for Ubuntu 14.04 but so far I could not find a single dark theme available. Is it possible to port a theme from Ubuntu 13.10 to 14.04? Or must I wait for zonColor (or whomever) to release new themes for Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: NoobsLab has made available through their PPA a new theme entitled Ambience-Dark-Red. It retains the default Unity decorations and icons and simply tweaks colours. Although not as good, it is at this stage the closest to DarkNight you can get for Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n\nTo install Ambience-Dark-Red:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ambiance-dark-red\n\nThe original Ambience-Dark theme is also available from NoobsLab. It is a low contrast theme that may be hard to read without the appropriate lighting/brightness.\n\n\nIt can be install with the following terminal commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ambiance-dark\n\nAn alternative, also from NoobsLab is the GnomishDark theme:\n\nNote that it was a bit buggy on Ubuntu 13.10. To install:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnomishdark\n\nUpdate\nA few more styles have been made available by NoobsLab:\nThe Mediterranean package includes some nice blueish themes worth trying. They also impose great changes to window decorations and icons that may not be to everyone's taste.\n\nTo install the Meditarranean package:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mediterranean-theme\n\nNumix Bluish is a variation of the Numix theme, with what to my eyes seem violet and green hues. There is again a good deal of customisation regarding icons and window decorations.\n\nTo install Numix Bluish:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install numix-bluish-theme\n\n\nA: Basically, you can use any one of the same styles from 13.10 as long as there is a GTK-3.0 theme included in the style. The Standard \"window themes\" are not applied if they are metacity themes like they did in 13.10. \nTo install a theme, download and unzip the file in your ~/.themes folder to make the theme available. You can even do this with the zoncolor theme.\nOpen a terminal and execute the following commands to install zonColor themes in 14.04 14.10 or any other distro as well:\nmkdir ~/.themes\ncd ~/.themes\nwget https://launchpadlibrarian.net/144070639/zoncolor-themes_1.6.5%7Esaucy%7ENoobslab.com.tar.gz\ntar zxvf zoncolor-themes_1.6.5~saucy~Noobslab.com.tar.gz\ncp -R zoncolor-themes/* .\n\nNow, the theme should be available through gnome-tweak-tool or unity-tweak-tool.\nTo download and install delorean dark theme 3.6 green execute the following commands (assuming you already have a ~/.themes folder. if not, execute mkdir ~/.themes)\ncd ~/.themes\nwget http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/344/0/4/delorean_dark_theme_3_6_g__vs_2_56_by_killhellokitty-d5nnoxt.zip\nunzip delorean_dark_theme_3_6_g__vs_2_56_by_killhellokitty-d5nnoxt.zip\n\nThe window buttons on deviantart are nolonger the ones shown and are OSX style. \nTo show the \"~/.themes\" folder in Nautilus, press ctrl + h to show hidden folders.\nHere's a link to the file page.\nHere's a link to killhellokitty gallery page\n", "Q: Receiving obscure data after upgrade to 14.04 I upgraded to 14.04 recently (obviously). Since the upgrade, I started noticing that my internet was extremely slow for the first couple of minutes.\nChecking the system monitor, it seems that my system downloads about 25MB after I connect to the internet, using the whole downstream. How can I check what process is requesting the download?\nUpdate. nethogs tells me that the service requesting the download is /usr/bin/python. So, it looks like a python script is downloading about 25MB every time I establish an  internet connection, which doesn't occur when I disable dropbox. What file would dropbox need to download every day? How can I track down the downloaded file?\n\nA: Dropbox may just be checking for updates and looking for any updated files. Not sure if this is because you have a lot of files or if 25MB is standard. You can try Wireshark to take a close look at the network traffic (not sure what you could expect to find though).\nYou can see what the most recently updated files are with the method answered here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5566310/how-to-recursively-find-and-list-the-latest-modified-files-in-a-directory-with-s\n", "Q: Set up OpenVPN (Mullvad)?

It is set to use Certificates(TLS) and is asking me for User Certificate, CA Certificate, and Private Key.

Thanks in advance for your attention.\n\nA: *\n\n*User Certificate => mullvad.crt\n\n*CA Certificate => ca.crt\n\n*Private Key => mullvad.key\n\n\nThe Private Key Password is only required if the Private Key is encrypted, if you don't have a password probably it is not needed.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu Phone support RTC Alarm? Is /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm present? Does phone wake up after setting it when it's completely switched off? What does it do when the phone is locked?\nWill it be supported in hardware by all phones/SOCs?\n\nA: I'm not part of Canonical, so I can't say what the plan is, but currently, mako, flo and hammerhead don't support rtc alarm (plus, hammerhead's RTC is kinda broken/rendered broken by other broken things). There are however some fixes in CyanogenMod's kernel for mako and flo which seem to fix it[1], so it is probably possible to make it work.\n[1] for example this commit: https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_kernel_google_msm/commit/c1429d6f7a8dc54f222aea14d63974cfca3d8df8\n", "Q: Theme and icons look old after upgrade to 14.04 - AMD GPU issues? Yesterday I upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 and I ran into a few problems. Interestingly I upgraded two computers (one of which has identical hardware) before this one and had no problems. \nWhen I booted up after the upgrade the screen was flickering, artifacts were everywhere, the 'theme' and icons looked like they came from a old version of Gnome and the background appeared only on half of one of my monitors (the rest was black and I couldn't even move my mouse on the black area). I have an AMD R9 280x so immediately my thought was that I should purge and reinstall the proprietary drivers. I did the following:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx-amdcccle fglrx-dev\nsudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-radeon\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\nsudo rm -rf /etc/ati\n\nAfter a restart the flickering issue was gone and my two monitors appeared to behave mostly ok (only problem is that the CCW I put on my 2nd monitor doesn't survive a restart), but the icons, buttons and theme remain looking like they came out an old version of Gnome. Also, the menu bar appears twice in every window: once in the title bar and once well as below in it's own barHere are some photos to show what I mean (sorry about the quality; I had to take them with my phone because the 'Print Scrn' button has also stopped working after the upgrade):\n\n\n\nHow can I fix this and get my 14.04 looking as beautiful as it was designed to look?\n\nA: Someone with Kubuntu had a similar problem and it turns out the solution works with Unity also:\nKDE Theme broken after 13.10 → 14.04 upgrade\nOriginal source from the Arch forums:\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=137257\nLong story short I just removed ~/.config/Trolltech.conf and restarted.

It seems that I need to notify Lubuntu of that. For example, the @ is under \\ and vice versa. I can live with it but it'd be nice if someone knew how to change it. I'm running amd64\n\nA: You probably just set the wrong keyboard layout for your location during the installation. I don't think the missing numpad has anything to do with it.\nFor example, I live in the Netherlands but we use the United States keyboard layout. There is a Dutch keyboard layout as well, which is different (obviously), but I don't know what it's used for. Selecting the Dutch keyboard layout for United States keyboard layout causes Lubuntu to link the wrong values to the keys.\nTo change your keyboard layout, check this wiki page (at Keyboard mapping for 13.10 and beyond).\n", "Q: Display problem in HP Compaq laptop I am recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 in my laptop HP Compaq with an AMD Turion processor.Model no.

If yes how can i get it? \nI have Ubuntu 12.04 running on a VmWare Player\nHope someone can help me\nGreetings\n\nA: Pactester is a tool to test proxy auto-configuration (PAC) files. So you need to create a wpad.dat file to configure the sites you want to have direct connection with and the sites you want to access using the proxy server. For example, the following wpad.dat file will bypass proxy for all hosts that are in the same subnet or in 10.0.0.0 but will access all other sites using the proxy server:\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host)\n{\n  if (isInNet(myIpAddress(),\"192.168.2.0\",\"255.255.255.0\")) return \"DIRECT\";\n  if (isPlainHostName(host) ||\n      isInNet(host, \"10.0.0.0\", \"255.0.0.0\")\n    return \"DIRECT\";\n  else\n    return \"PROXY proxy_host:port_no\";\n};\n\nAs you can see the wpad.dat file is a javascript file.\nSo, the problem is you don't have a wpad.dat file which will tell pactester what rules to follow for various hosts. You need to create that first.\n(Source)\n", "Q: My Swedish keyboard is set to English in Ubuntu 14.04 Just installed Ubuntu 14.04 this morning and I cannot get back my Swedish keyboard, even though I did have the Swedish keyboard in the setting. \nAny clue on how I can get it back?\n\nA: System Settings - Text entry - verify that Swedish is here. \nThats how I solve English and Czech keyboard\n\nA: Pick your keyboard and go to Layouts then click on Add where you can add the language and layout you want to your keyboard.\nOnce back to your keyboard screen, select the current language of your keyboard and click on Remove to get rid of  it, and you are done.\nThis is the simplest graphical and friendly solution.\n\nA: I have similar problem.

Trying to compile and use OpenFST on Ubuntu 13.10 leads to link errors like \"undefined references to dlopen\". How does one fix this? Searching online suggests including -ldl in the gcc command line, but that is not sufficient.\n\nA: Compile as follows:\n./configure LDFLAGS=-Wl,--no-as-needed\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nTo compile your a.cpp which uses the library, do\ng++ -I /usr/local/include a.cpp /usr/local/lib/libfst.so -Wl,--no-as-needed -ldl\n\nIt is important the -ldl appears after -Wl,--no-as-needed.\nRunning your program works as you'd expect from the README provided by OpenFST, you just need to have /usr/local/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For example,\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib\" ./a.out\n\n\nA: As can be seen in the Catalogue of Built-In Rules:\n\nLinking a single object file\nn is made automatically from n.o by running the linker (usually called\n  ld) via the C compiler.

Therefore, Online Accounts should be involved only where it is reasonably likely to save time. So it should not be used to handle special-purpose accounts that are only ever used for one app; that would make the overall experience more complex for no gain.\n\nNote that the page mainly deals with the mobile implementation; but the general advice applies to the desktop one too. I would ask you to reconsider whether you really need to integrate with UOA.\n\nIf you do decide to go ahead with it, though; AFAIK, the user must first have installed an app that registers that is utilizes some service; then you can create a new account for that service in the Settings section.\nUnfortunately, I don't think it allows 3-rd party apps to integrate arbitrary services yet (the circular data consumption would make for a 'kitchen sink', as it's called).\n", "Q: Need a shell script to find the latest file from a directory and move it to another on a weekly basis I am new to shell scripting and I need some help with it.

I then powered it off via the \"poweroff\" command, cloned the VM using the VirtualBox GUI.\nAfter this point, the machines will not boot, neither the original or the clone. When I power them on, I get the VirtualBox EFI shell rather than GRUB.\nThe required EFI partitions are certainly present (the machine will boot at least once) so I know that's not an issue, which also rules out issues like \"GRUB not being installed\".\nI would like these machines to be bootable, but I'm more curious as to why cloning a VM in UEFI mode prevents the original machine from booting. I could possibly see disk UUIDs changing affecting a clone, but I'm baffled as to why the original machine also won't boot.\n\nA: It's not the cloning that's causing the problems; it's powering off the virtual machine. Unfortunately, changes made by the Linux efibootmgr utility in the guest don't survive very long under VirtualBox. Because these changes are required to boot, the result is that once VirtualBox forgets them, you can't boot any longer. There are two broad classes of solution to this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can rename your boot manager or boot loader of choice to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. This is done to files on the virtual machine's EFI System Partition (ESP), which is generally /dev/sda1. For a stock Ubuntu install, you'd rename EFI/ubuntu to EFI/BOOT and then rename grubx64.efi to bootx64.efi to make this work.\n\n*You can use some other tool to adjust the virtual NVRAM settings. The VirtualBox EFI user interface has a way to do this, but the steps are rather awkward. You could also use the bcfg command in an EFI shell. In either case, you must create an entry for the boot loader/manager of your choice, such as the EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi binary that the Ubuntu installer put on the hard disk.\n\n", "Q: ubuntu14.04 installation I installed Ubuntu 14.04 desktop i386.iso version (Intel) version but I am not shure\nwhat version of Ubuntu 14.04 I need for installation on Intel Pentium D CPU 2.8Ghz x 2 and Grafics -> Gallium 0.4 on ATI RV370    \n\nA: Pentium D supports 64-bit versions of Ubuntu, so you could use either the 32 or 64 bit ISO.\nBoth should support your ATI GPU and offer you the ability to install various drivers after the install completes. Once you're booted, open the Dash and search for \"Drivers\".

Booted into recovery mode to get a root shell so that I could edit /etc/fstab and re-instate the entry.\n\nA: What worked for the original poster was: recursively correcting the permissions of their home directory.\nsudo chmod -R ug+rwx /home/[username]\n\nTo be more specific, the problem is with the .Xauthority in your home folder. You simply need to change its permissions to yourself or, as it was in my case, it was owned by root, so I needed to change the owner to my user. This way you don't need to change the permissions for every file in your home folder.\n\nA: I am having the same problem. Fixed by chown the whole home directory. \nchown -R [user-name]:[user-name] /home/[user-name]\n\ndetails in this post\nUnable to mount home-directory for user after fresh install 14.04\n\nA: I had that too.  It seems that 14.04 uses something called ubuntu-session for login, while the old 12.04 used something called unity-desktop.  Since I tried to upgrade from the desktop itself, there were problems deleting it, and I was barred from logging in the next time.\nTo fix, boot the machine, and as soon as the grub loader comes up, scroll down to \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\" which will probably be the 2nd entry.  Hit enter.  On the next page, choose \"Ubuntu, with Linux 3.13.0-30 (recovery mode)\" or a similar entry.  It could be the 2nd entry on that page.  This brings up some recovery options.\nScroll down to the thing that says \"network Enable networking\" and hit enter.  This is IMPORTANT, otherwise Ubuntu can't find the files it needs on the internet.  After networking is enabled, scroll to \"dpkg  Repair broken packages\" and hit enter.  That should install the needed ubuntu-session, delete the old unity-desktop, and fix up any other things that were missed also.\n", "Q: Advice on what FS to use I am installing a 2TB drive on an Ubuntu server that will be accessible on a network of Windows and Ubuntu machines. Should I format it using FAT32 or EXT3/4?\nThanks\nDavid C\n\nA: The / folder of Ubuntu should be ext, it can be ext, ext2, ext3, or ext4, but better off stick with ext4.\nHowever, you will be able to read and write data to FAT32 or NTFS or ext partitions, so you just need your / partitions(analogous to the C: drive for windows) to be ext.\n\nA: Ext4 is preferred. It has better performance than ext3, and FAT32 is not a journaled filesystem, so is at higher risk of data loss.\nThe way you share it (i.e. NFS, Samba/CIFS) should abstract the filesystem itself, allowing a Windows system to interact with it, even though Windows doesn't natively handle ext4. \n", "Q: How can I 'cd' into directory from folder in desktop gui view?

I tried \"sudo apt-get purge software-center\" but that said it would remove the Ubuntu desktp. So how can I completely remove it (config files and everything) then reinstall it?\nThanks!\n\nA: ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package. Removing it will not actually make your desktop inoperable.\nYour method is correct, though I use explicit flags when I remove:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge software-center\n\nThis will remove config files as well as the package. To install it again:\nsudo apt-get install software-center\n\nYou could also add ubuntu-desktop to that command after the software-center package, if you want to be sure you are still tracking it.\n\nA: To remove a package without the dependencies use dpkg\nsudo dpkg -P <package> --force-depends\n\nThen you can re-install it with apt-get\n", "Q: Can't switch between lightdm and gdm I installed Ubuntu Studio 13.10 from a minimal CD, and then upgraded to 14.04.

Should I wait a few weeks until all the numerous problems I am reading about 14.04 are resolved? I don't want to risk messing up my win7.\n\nA: Back up your Windows 7 and make sure you have your activation key written down and you can burn a Windows 7 boot disk if you need to (ask in the comments below if you want specific help with this).\nThen overwrite 13.10 with 14.04. I think it's highly unlikely that this will mess with Windows 7 if you make sure you click 'Delete 13.10 and Install 14.04' (or similar) in the install menu. The only possible problem is that GRUB might break on upgrade and then you won't be able to boot (which is when your Windows 7 backup/disk/key will come in useful) but I don't think this is very likely.\n", "Q: xubuntu 14.04 Xfce 4.12 Is there a way to install xfce4.12 in xubuntu 14.04?\nI tried the ppa from xubuntu-dev, but it's only available for 12.04, 12.10 and 13.10\nGreets\nJens\n//Edit\nAny news about it?\n\nA: $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.10\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.12\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade \n\nthat's how I installed it on my system, but you're right and we're discussing the issue here\n", "Q: How do I set up my network configuration for static IP address in VirtualBox? My ISP has a static IP address. Therefore, whenever I use the guest machine in VirtualBox, I have to set the network to NAT. All other VMs get the same IP address. If I set network to bridged, I am unable to use the internet, presumably as a result of the static IP address. How can I set up my network more conveniently?\n\nA: A bridged network functions like a physical ethernet port. This is really useful if you're on a local network or if you've got multiple static IP addresses.\nIf you only have a single static IP address and it's already assigned to your computer, you won't be able to use bridged networking since there's no IP address to assign to it.\nYou'll have to use NAT in order to connect.\nIf you've got multiple IP addresses, bridged networking should work after you manually assign the address and proper network settings. The method should be the same as you did with your main computer. If your main computer was auto-assigned an IP address, it's probably a sign that you don't have multiple static addresses, as they probably would have been assigned by DHCP like your main computer.\n", "Q: UFW rules don't work with docker I have a 12.04.4 server, and I have enabled ufw, and have tried to block port 8080.

The IP address is handled via static assignment, but I can't find anything that would indicate that that is the problem.\nThe service I'm trying to block is on a docker instance, however this question did not help.\n\nA: The docker template that I am using is for Discourse. I solved it by editing the containers/app.yml file to include this under the ''expose' section:  \n - \"127.0.0.1:20080:80\"\n\nThis means that it routes port 20080 on 127.0.0.1 to port 80 on the docker instance, thus removing the need entirely for a ufw rule.\n\nA: I tested it.\nWhen I enter the command: sudo ufw deny 80, I could connect to myself, But other host could not.\nI suggest you try to connect from any other than you.\n\nA: The iptables docker rules are evaluated after the ufw ones. I wanted to restrict all IPs except one (of a VPN server) and I found the better solution in the docker documentation\n", "Q: network manager not listing wireless networks I just installed ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop.\nBefore I used Ubuntu 13.10 and I had no problem accessing the list of wireless network until I installed this version of Ubuntu.\nAll of a sudden, the network manager doesn't seem to be picking up any wireless networks. \nThis is some hardware informations :\nsudo uname -a\nLinux aimad-Vostro-1015 3.13.0-24-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 10 19:08:14 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux\n\nsudo lspci\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Memory Controller Hub (rev 07)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 07)\n00:02.1 Display controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 07)\n00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #4 (rev 03)\n00:1a.1 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #5 (rev 03)\n00:1a.2 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #6 (rev 03)\n00:1a.7 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller #2 (rev 03)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 1 (rev 03)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 2 (rev 03)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 4 (rev 03)\n00:1c.4 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 5 (rev 03)\n00:1c.5 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 6 (rev 03)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #1 (rev 03)\n00:1d.1 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #2 (rev 03)\n00:1d.2 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #3 (rev 03)\n00:1d.7 USB controller: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller #1 (rev 03)\n00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge (rev 93)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation ICH9M LPC Interface Controller (rev 03)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 82801IBM/IEM (ICH9M/ICH9M-E) 4 port SATA Controller [AHCI mode] (rev 03)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) SMBus Controller (rev 03)\n09:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

So you can do it the safe way, which is the third step. If you want to reinstall 12.04 with the exception of it being 14.04 after the reinstall, you can delete the partition of 12.04, install 12.04 again, and again:\nsudo apt-get do-release-update\n\nHere's what i said what it was the third way, which is like the second way:\nRemove the Ubuntu 12.04 partition and install 14.04 using whatever way you want.\n\nA: Plug in the bootable pen drive and restart.

When I first booted up Ubuntu, the HD was already mounted at /media/myusername/Data (\"Data\" is the volume description I used when formatting it).

Is that right?\n\nA: Although rare, Linux malware & viruses do exist. The strict layered structure of Linux makes it however less vulnarable, but not immune. It can also not be excluded that you make a mistake, and authorize a malicious piece of software to do harmfull things.\nIn practice however, you will mainly use a virusscanner to protect your Windows partners. ClamAV does scan for Windows viruses as well.\n\nA: ClamAV will scan for any viruses in it's database. The majority are Windows viruses.\nThere are very few viruses for Linux, and most people are safe not running anti-virus.\n", "Q: keyboard layout EN after boot I can't believe this bug has still not been solved with Ubuntu 14.04 ?\nOn my 2 laptops, Acer and Asus, on a random basis, the keyboard layout switch from FR to EN.\nThis is very frustrating when you type a password and can't see the letters.\nHow to solve that for good ?\n\nA: This should fix the problem in 13.10 and 14.04:\nIn the ubuntu software center, install \"dconf Editor\" (dconf-editor) (if you don't already have it).

It starts playing alright, but if I move the slider totem crashes. \nIt used to work like a champ in 13.10 so I know the problem is not in the file.\nI switched to VLC and it doesn't seem to have the same problem. \nAny ideas? Is this a known issue?\n\nA: Totem does not play .mkv files correctly, this is not only an issue for you. For me, it won't even load them, let alone fast forward. Apparently the issue differers with what graphics card and/or drivers you use.\nI would definitely reccomend using VLC instead (it IS free as in freedom), it may look ugly and problematic at first, but you can set it to look better and work even better than totem.\nThere are ways to fix it, but they are usually complex and don't work as good as using VLC out of the box. These fixes don't work for most users anyways, so I wouldn't suggest even trying.\nYou could also use a different player such as mplayer if you want, but I would definetally reccomend VLC out of the three.\n", "Q: How do you cd into the first available folder without typing out the name?

If I try to autocomplete I get the following error:\nbash: completion: function `_ssh' not found\n\nIf I autocomplete on ssh before I try pssh everything works. As far as I know, it's because the autocomplete rules are not loaded before they are used. Until the autocomplete rules for ssh gets loaded, my rules are invalid and result in an error.\nHow to I fix this, how do I correctly hook my alias into an autocomplete rule defined for a regular linux command?\n\nA: Newer bash completion releases (>=2.0) improved hugely the time used to load the autocompletion logic. They made them by loading on request the required files, the newer location for these files is:\n/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/\nIf you use ls -lah to explore such directory you'll find than there exist many soft links. That's because a file is needed for every command/alias, so, if you have pssh, pscp and prdp you'll need to create links with those names:\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/ssh /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/psss\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/ssh /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/pscp\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/ssh /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/prdp\n\nAnother alternative is to syslink the ssh autocompletion file to /etc/bash_completion.d/\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/ssh /etc/bash_completion.d/ssh\n\nThe former method will load the _ssh function on every single bash interactive session (making slower the startup).\nAfter using any of the above methods your complete -F _ssh pssh ... configuration will relate the _ssh function with your aliases.\n", "Q: 14.04 System hangs and IO errors To my surprise, after todays fresh Ubuntu 14.04 install (fully updated as of today) I'm getting various problems like random hangs and I/O errors when copying/moving files (moving backup from HDD to SSD - checked both drives and there aren't any bad sectors).

Or should I go back to Windows 7.\n\nA: If If the standard 14.04 with Unity desktop enviroment does not perform well enough, you can always try either Xubuntu or Lubuntu, both are Ubuntu variants, designed to run more efficiently on low-specification computers, while built on the same 14.04 base, which has long-term support.\nIf you have 14.04 already installed, you don't have to reinstall ubuntu from scratch,\nas you can install them both to an existing system, alongside Unity, if you have enough free space on the drive, of course.\nto install Xubuntu\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nor do the same with Lubuntu, which some people find even faster\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nAfterwards, when you log out try to log in, you can choose between desktop enviroments on the login screen.\nSee if these perform better on your hardware.\n\nA: Yes 14.04 is a good release for a netbook.

Now I faced a smaller problem that still seems to be too much for me. Now that the PCIe card has a different ID(if i understood the idea) the system can't find the right driver for it. So how can i force my system to use the right driver for Intel centrino n-2230? If you need some information, please ask.\n\nA: Your Intel uses the driver iwlwifi that is present in all recent Ubuntu versions. I will be very surprised if it is not loading already.

Sometimes it doesn't work correctly. Please show us:\nrfkill list all \n\nAlso check to see if the wireless is disabled in the BIOS.\n\nA: I am not reputable enough to send you a comment, but I just wanted to wish you luck with the centrino n-2230.  I have seen many reports of issues, as well as first hand experience with 350 laptops riddled with issues on a school network.

I noticed during the live cds that my main monitor (powered by my nvidia card) wasn't working, and I figured that a proprietary driver install would fix it.  It didn't.  I also tried the nouveau driver, but to no avail.  I understand I need to go to the nvidia-settings to enable the monitor, but I cannot get it to load anything but the options page and some other useless tab.\nI remembered this issue back when I used to use my old laptop (I ran 12.04, and I would've had that on this PC sooner but I was waiting for 14.04), and I knew that running something like optirun -b primus glxgears would fix it, but it didn't.

Note that I haven't quite gotten my second monitor running off of integrated graphics to work yet, but because the Nvidia drivers are working, I'm thinking it shouldn't be too big of a hassle.  \nI've found that manual installs work best for installing nvidia drivers, so go to the geforce site and download the latest drivers.  By default, it'll most likely go into /Downloads, but if not, just know where it is.  Then, you'll want to press \nctrl + alt +F1-F6 (each is a different login)\nAnd then sign in to your account.  Then, you'll want to use\nsudo stop lightdm \n\n(or)    \nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nThis shuts down the things that are using the GUI, so they can be updated.\nThen run\nchmod +x ~/* Folder that said driver is located in * / * Driver *\n\nFor example,\nchmod +x ~/Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run\n\nMake SURE that you have the entire name of the driver, otherwise this will not work!  Caps do matter!\nWhat you just did was make the file executable.  Next, you'll want to run the following command, changed of course like the example above to fit your directories/driver versions.\nsudo sh ~/Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run\n\nFor me, tabbing the rest of the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run file does not work, but it is CRUCIAL THAT YOU DO THIS.  If nothing happens after you run the second command, check your caps and spelling to make sure they are right.  You have to go through the program using the keyboard to correctly install it.  For me it will tell me that something went wrong right off the bat, just keep going and see if it still works.  If it asks you to install 32 bit libraries, do so.  Some programs (like steam games) will not run unless you have these installed.\nAfter all of the above has been done, one final command must be completed, or of course you could reboot.  \n\nsudo start lightdm (or sudo service lightdm start)\n\nThen, you'll do\n\nctrl + alt+ F7-F9ish (F7 is usually default, some people have different F keys though)\n\nThis should have worked for most people, if not keep looking, there's always a fix.  If anyone knows something about getting virtual 7.1 audio to work, please message me somehow.  Thanks.  Hope I helped someone.\nEdit:I've also heard x-swat repositories work better at times.

At reboot it usually comes back. When the icon is there I can add devices and connect to them, but they are instantly disconnected.

Any comments are greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I have the same problem on my Dell E7440 running Ubuntu 14.04 / Linux Mint 17.1 with kernel 3.19 and latest firmware blobs. After pairing a bluetooth device, wifi becomes unusable. But both bluetooth and wifi work without problems when the other one is disabled.\nhttps://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi recommends to disable bluetooth coexistance. To do so, load the iwlwifi module with bt_coex_active=0.\nTo make this setting permanent at start, type the following into a terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/wifi.conf\n\nThe file should be empty. Then add the following line:\noptions iwlwifi bt_coex_active=0\n\nSave the changes and reboot.\nEdit:\nUnfortunately, this does not work :-(\nI don't know what I tested, but setting bx_coex_active=0 disables bluetooth completely.\nI also tested using a 502.11g connection instead of a faster 502.11n one. The module option to disable 502.11n is  11n_disable=1. It sounds a bit better, but in my testcase (listening internet radio via my Jambox) I cannot reliably tell if the wifi or the BT connection is bad.\nEdit 2:\nReloading the iwlwifi kernel module after pairing with the Jambox also helped to get a better Wifi connection. In a console, type\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\nsudo modprobe iwlwifi\n\nI tried this originally because I wasn't able to connect the Wifi even with disabled BT.

Back then she sent the dump files from Windows to Dell, who sent an engineer who changed the motherboard, but still after setting up Ubuntu in many different versions using many different kernels the panics would not go away. \nSo I decided to take action in order to find the exact cause of the problem, I installed and configured the linux-crashdump package (kdump-tools) to automatically start a crash kernel using kexec that generates a dump file of the memory and also stores dmesg output. \nI also installed crash, the kernel-image-generic-dbgsym and mcelog in order to have everything to gather as much information as possible. \nSo the Laptop crashed and the crash kernel successfully generated a dump file and stored the dmesg output. \nI also checked out /var/log/mcelog but the file was completely empty, although the daemon was running before the crash, which is strange, but after all we still have the dmesg output, that states:\n[ 3933.364173] mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 4: Machine Check Exception: 5 Bank 3: be00000000200135\n[ 3933.364177] mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP !INEXACT! 10:<ffffffff8171d9c2> {_raw_spin_lock+0x12/0x50}\n[ 3933.364182] mce: [Hardware Error]: TSC a0255fbd7f7 ADDR 42dd14480 MISC d62285 \n[ 3933.364185] mce: [Hardware Error]: PROCESSOR 0:306a9 TIME 1398357146 SOCKET 0 APIC 1 microcode 15\n[ 3933.364186] mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'\n[ 3933.364188] mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 5 Bank 3: be00000000200135\n[ 3933.364190] mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP !INEXACT! 33:<0000045a7992c1b5> \n[ 3933.364191] mce: [Hardware Error]: TSC a0255fbd7f0 ADDR 42dd14480 MISC d62285 \n[ 3933.364194] mce: [Hardware Error]: PROCESSOR 0:306a9 TIME 1398357146 SOCKET 0 APIC 0 microcode 15\n[ 3933.364195] mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'\n[ 3933.364196] mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Processor context corrupt\n[ 3933.364197] Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal Machine check\n\nSo my first question would be, regarding \"Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'\" ... what exactly should I run there and how? \nI tried for example:\n[ 3933.364173] mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 4: Machine Check Exception: 5 Bank 3: be00000000200135 | sudo mcelog --ascii\n\nwhich simply returned nothing.

Isn't it the purpose of --domain to set the name of the domain?\n\nA: The error talks about a domain, but it's actually the host name which is already in use.\nThe --domain option sets the domain to which the VM belongs, not the actual name of the machine. To set the name of the machine, use --hostname option (found in vmbuilder kvm ubuntu --help).\n\nA: I faced the same issue. Each VM will have a subdirectory called ubuntu-kvm\nI overcame this issue by creating a new directory for each VM.\nyou have to create e.g. /var/lib/libvirt/images/vm1, /var/lib/libvirt/images/vm2, and so on. \nEach VM will have a subdirectory called ubuntu-kvm, and there can be just one such directory in /var/lib/libvirt/images/vm1. \nIf you try to create a second VM in /var/lib/libvirt/images/vm1, you will get an error message saying ubuntu-kvm already exists.\n", "Q: Manage Snapshots So Ubuntu supports LVM. This in turn supports creating and restoring snapshots of the hard drive. Coming from Windows, this is a highly useful feature for restoring the system to a previous point (In Windows called System Restore), also great for backups!\nI would specifically like to schedule snapshots to be taken periodically (say every Sunday) and would also like an easy way to manage and delete snapshots. And of course, to restore back to a snapshot if need be.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: LVM is currently not usable for this.  The current snapshot implementation falls apart when you try to create multiple and/or long lived snapshots.  Supposedly there is a new snapshot implementation coming down the pike that may be able to handle this, but it isn't here yet.\n", "Q: Using the Themes in the Repository (14.04) Ubuntu's unity-tweak-tool only has three themes, Ambiance, Highcontrast, and Radiance.\nThe repository appears to have quiet a few.  I installed gnome-themes-ubuntu via Synaptic.  The description shows it contains, Dust, Dust San and New Wave.\nNone of those three appears in the unit-tweak-tool menu.  However they do appear in the gnome-tweak-tool's menu.  When I select them from gnome-tweak-tool, nothing happens.\nIs there another step to use these themes in Ubuntu 14.04?\nAlso, is there some way of getting a list of themes (more than just the default three mentioned above) for Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: Xangua has answered my question.  From his comments it appears that the Themes in the Ubuntu Repository isn't supported in the current 14.04 version of Ubuntu.  Hopefully the developers will consider putting supported themes there so that the users can have a variety.\nThere might be other resources, but the only one that I found (so far) is the one linked by Xangua in the comments above.  It might not be the most definitive, but it appears that the all the Themes in the gtk3 category are supported.\nIf this theory is correct, then anyone having problems with Ubuntu 14.04 and Themes can verify they are using a gtk3 type theme and it should work.\nMy next question (of which I'll spend time researching first) is to learn how to edit the title bar and borders of the gtk3 themes.\nThat's my only problem with the stock Ubuntu, is that you can't easily distinguish between the active and inactive windows and it's hard to tell (without window borders) where one window ends and the next begins, especially when having more than one terminal window on your screen.\nThe Themes in the Repository question is solved!\n", "Q: How to I use Androidx86 ubuntu dualboot? I Dual Booted Android x86 and Ubuntu, and used the 40_custom file. So when I chose android Kitkat from the Grub2 menu, it started Android, and it loaded for a long time in the page where the glossy Android is written. I waited for 40 minutes and still nothing happened.\nHow can I boot into androidx86?\n\nA: If you see the glossy Android logo, you have already booted into Androidx86.\nThis can be due to a graphics card problem.\nTry this, press tab on boot menu and change androidboot.hardware=android-x86 to androidboot.hardware=x86\n\nA: terminal commands for new grub entry may not be complete. try these steps.\nI believe this is adaptable for use on any Ubuntu distribution to dual boot with Android X86 without having to use separate partitions for each OS. This works thanks to the ability to use the same ext4 journaling file system for both operating systems. It took me a couple days to compile this. If your Ubuntu or Android X86 distribution are different, simply remember to make the appropriate terminal command changes (Android X86 4.4 to 5.1 would look like; initrd /android-4.4-r3/initrd.img} to initrd /android-5.1-r1/initrd.img}). Check system for 64 bit support before downloading .ISO files. If your system does not support 64 bit, use 32 bit, or 86 bit.\n\nHow to install dual boot of Android 4.4 x86 r3 and Ubuntu (on the same partition)\n(Works with other revisions and versions of Android X86)\nThings you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Non-partitioned HDD (formatted)\n\n*(x2) USB flash drives 2GB or larger\n\n*Secondary PC to flash .ISO files to USB flash drives\n\n\nBegin by downloading Unetbootin, and .ISO files for both Android x86, and Ubuntu.\nFlash the .ISO files to each of the USB flash drives.\nEnter BIOS on PC with formatted HDD and enable booting from USB/CD.\nReboot PC with USB flash drive inserted containing Ubuntu .ISO and complete a full install.\nReboot PC with USB flash drive inserted containing Android x86 4.4 r3 and begin install following these exceptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*When prompted, select HDD sda1 and DO NOT format or select another file system.\n\n*When prompted, DO NOT install GRUB, or EFI GRUB 2.\n\n*When prompted, select as read and write.\n\n\nRemove all media and boot the PC (it will automatically load Ubuntu).\nOpen the terminal and type:\nsudo -i\nnano /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\nUsing the arrow keys, navigate the the line below the last current entry in the custom boot loader menu and make the following four entries:\nmenuentry \"Android-x86\" {\nset root='(hd0,1)'\nlinux /android-4.4-r3/kernel quiet root=/dev/ram0 androidboot.hardware=generic_x86 acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode SRC=/android-4.4-r3\ninitrd /android-4.4-r3/initrd.img}\n\nPress and hold ctrl, x, then press y, and then press Enter\nType:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\nImmediately after BIOS loads, press and hold the Shift key until GRUB loads.\nSelect which operating system you wish to use.\n\nRECOMMENDED! Load Ubuntu first, and create a disk image (.ISO file) of your new dual boot set-up and flash it to another USB flash drive and store it as a backup. You can do this after you apply any updates, or install any programs you wish.\n\nThe result should be a dual booted Ubuntu and Android X86 utilizing the default Ubuntu GRUB2 boot loader menu with the benefits of; no separate partition for OS's, shared Linux swap space, same file system (ext4), space for installation of Android applications limited ONLY to the space remaining on your HDD (not a weak 2Gb-??Gb partition), and the ability to file browse between Ubuntu and Android X86. Essentially you have installed Android X86 within Ubuntu.\nnote: Unetbootin now has a self contained application downloadable and compatible with Windows.\n", "Q: Is there a way to bring the terminal to the front when whatever I launched is done?

To search for any subject, like passwords, use the k option like this:\n\nman -k password\n\nThis gives you the correct syntax for commands that match the search criteria.  To view the man page for passwd:\n\nman passwd\n\nTo change the password for the account you are logged in as:\n\npasswd\nabc123\nEnterNewPasswordHere\n\nReference: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-change-password/\n\nA: Recently, changing the password with sudo passwd on the terminal only updates the password for your current terminal session. To change your password throughout the system permanently:\nRun shell as root\nsudo -i\n\nThen change the password in root shell for my account:\npasswd <username>\n\nRemember to exit the root shell after changing the password!\n", "Q: DOSBox is unable to run c program I am using ubuntu 12.04 LTS and I installed DOSBox emulator to run TC.

I was running Ubuntu 13.10 and I got a window indicating I could upgrade to 14.04.  I accepted the upgrade, and after the upgrade was finished I was left with an empty Unity background and a mouse pointer. After rebooting a few times without getting anything I decided to download the iso image for 14.04 and ran the installation again from the disk. \nDuring the installation I selected the option to keep all the user files intact. The installation asked me for a username and a password.  I used my first name as username (my previous username was different, it was my nickname, but I could not remember at the time. For the password I used the same as the password I had before. Now when I sign in I don’t see any of the settings I had before. All icons are gone from the desktop and from the Unity launch bar. \nWhen I launch Files I can see \"computer\" file system and I can still see the home folder and under that I can see a folder with my new username and another with my previous username. This folder has all my files in it (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, etc.). I tried creating a user with my nickname (the same name as that folder) and used the same password, but I cannot login with it. \nI need help getting back as that user so that I can see all the apps and environment as I used to. Can someone help?\n\nA: Just go to your previous user's folder as root (launch sudo nautilus from Terminal). Inside, press Ctrl+H (will show hidden files and folders), Ctrl+A (will select them all), Ctrl+C (will copy to the clipboard). Then go inside your new user's folder and press Ctrl+V (paste). Answer Yes to the questions given to overwrite newly created files.\nThen, open Terminal inside your home folder and type:\nsudo chown -R new_user:new_user new_user/\n\nWhere new_user is your new user's name.\nNext, I'm going to do this in terminal fully. My old name was hopungo and new is Danatela:\ncd /home\nsudo cp -r hopungo/* Danatela/\nsudo chown -R Danatela:Danatela Danatela/\nsudo rm -rf hopungo\n\n", "Q: How to convert Kilobytes to Megabytes or gigabytes through terminal? I try to find the size of my disk, so i runned the below command\n$ sudo fdisk -s /dev/sda\n976762584\n\nIt shows like above. I think the size(976762584) of the disk is shown  in kilobytes. How do i convert the value to megabytes or gigabytes through terminal for better understanding?\n\nA: In awk\nTo find the size of the disk in Megabytes,\n$ sudo fdisk -s /dev/sda | awk '{$1=$1/1024; print $1,\"MB\";}'\n953870 MB\n\nTo find the size of the disk in Gigabytes,\n$ sudo fdisk -s /dev/sda | awk '{$1=$1/(1024^2); print $1,\"GB\";}'\n931.513 GB\n\n\nA: There's a tool called units, which can be used for units conversion:\n$ units -o \"%.0f\" -t \"4 gibibytes\" \"mebibytes\"\n4096\n\nIt is available as a package via apt install units.\nIt is a fairly standard tool, that can be found installed by default on various other UNIX-like systems (e.g., FreeBSD). Keep in mind that units(1) syntax may differ across implementations available on various operating systems. Here's the same conversion but this time with FreeBSD units(1):\n$ units -o \"%0.f\" -t \"4 gigabytes\" \"megabytes\"\n4096\n\n\nA: If the size is given in Kilobytes, you need to calculate through Bash built-in expressions.\nAssuming block size = 512B, you have to type:\necho $((`fdisk -s /dev/sda`*512/1024))\n\nThis will show disk size in KiB. To go further, just add /1024 to the end of expression:\necho $((`fdisk -s /dev/sda`*512/1024/1024))\n\nThis will show disk size in MiB and so on.\n\nA: numfmt (part of GNU Coreutils) can be used here:\n$ sudo fdisk -s /dev/sda\n976762584\n\n$ sudo fdisk -s /dev/sda | numfmt --to=iec-i --suffix=B --format=\"%.2f\"\n931.52MiB\n\n\nA: The shell does fixed-width integer arithmetic with no check for  overflow.  So, when doing a calculation that might involve either large numbers or fractions, bc is a good choice.  To get megabytes:\n$ echo \"scale=2; $(sudo fdisk -s /dev/sda6) / 1024\" | bc\n13641.75\n\nTo get gigabytes:\n$ echo \"scale=2; $(sudo fdisk -s /dev/sda6) / 1024^2\" | bc\n12.70\n\nThe assignment scale=2 tells bc to display two decimal places.\n\nA: You can do this natively with Bash and pseudo-floating point numbers. Define this function in your ~/.bashrc and reopen your terminal:\nfunction BytesToHuman() {\n\n    # https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/44040/a-standard-tool-to-convert-a-byte-count-into-human-kib-mib-etc-like-du-ls1/259254#259254\n\n    read StdIn\n\n    b=${StdIn:-0}; d=''; s=0; S=(Bytes {K,M,G,T,E,P,Y,Z}iB)\n    while ((b > 1024)); do\n        d=\"$(printf \".%02d\" $((b % 1024 * 100 / 1024)))\"\n        b=$((b / 1024))\n        let s++\n    done\n    echo \"$b$d ${S[$s]}\"\n\n} # BytesToHuman ()\n\nNow test it:\n$ sudo fdisk -s /dev/sda\n976762584\n\n$ sudo fdisk -s /dev/sda | BytesToHuman\n931.51 MiB\n\n\nA: If you're using Bash or Zsh, this function will perform the calculation for you.

We have a need to run a document management system for our binary machine drawings and other documents. \nI liked the Gitlab model for source code control that lets me use Ubuntu as server and provides a web interface for Windows users to work on their projects using clients like Source tree etc.\nI tried all the links that I get when I searched on the web - OpenKM, DocMGR, Epiware but none works.

This page shows how to install Redmine on various operating systems including Ubuntu.\n\n*Gitlab is a lot more like Github, works only with Git, offers per project wiki, walls, user access control and more. This page contains instructions how to install Gitlab.\nBoth Redmine and Gitlab are written in Ruby (Ruby on Rails), Redmine is free while Gitlab offers a Community Edition.\n\nA: If I understand the need correctly, you need to store the assets of the company, such as images, documents, videos etc. which can easily be found later and are properly tagged. If that is the case, then you can try out ResourceSpace which can help you categorize content and make it easy for you to find it later.\nIt is a PHP based applications, and using linux tools such as FFmpeg, ExifTool, ImageMagick etc. to assist in categorizing content and generate thumbnails etc. It would also work fine with Windows users as it offers a web based interface.\n", "Q: Install orchis-gtk theme on Ubuntu 14.04 I am trying to install the orchis-gtk theme on Ubuntu 14.04.\nhttp://mokaproject.com/orchis-gtk-theme/download/\nIt said 'Orchis requires the Murrine engine for it's GTK2 aspects.'\nWhat does that mean?

There is an Ubuntu-specific distribution page, which I assume you found since you have the commands from that page. For those looking for it, \nhttp://mokaproject.com/orchis-gtk-theme/download/ubuntu/\nNote, however, that you must use\nsudo apt-get install orchis-gtk-theme\n\nInstead of what you have above, \n[incorrect]sudo apt-get install orchis-gtk-t\n\nwhich I assume was a typo\n", "Q: Group permissions allow, but still get permission denied I have a ext4 partition and I've set the group owner for all subdirectors to mygroup:\n# chgrp -R mygroup /mount/abc\n# chmod -R g+swrx /mount/abc\n\nMy user is part of that group. Inside that partition is a folder who is owned by user 'nobody' and now by the group 'mygroup'. My user is part of 'mygroup'. Here's an ls -l:\nmyuser@host:/mount/abc/folder$ ls -l\ndrwxr-sr-x 2 nobody      mygroup      4096 Apr 25 12:08 ./\ndrwxrwsrwx 6 nobody      mygroup      4096 Apr 24 07:57 ../\n-rw-r-xr-- 1 otheruser   mygroup    159539 Apr 23 23:44 test.png*\n\nmyuser@host:/mount/abc/folder$ groups myuser\nmyuser : mygroup {... a list of other groups also...} \n\nmyuser@host:/mount/abc/folder$ rm test.png \nrm: remove write-protected regular file ‘test.png’? y\nrm: cannot remove ‘test.png’: Permission denied\n\nmyuser@host:/mount/abc/folder$ touch test.txt\ntouch: cannot touch ‘test.txt’: Permission denied\n\nNote that I cannot delete nor create a file that is owned by a group that my user is a part of.\nI guess I don't fully understand how groups work. I thought if you were part of a group then you inherit the permissions of that group. Am I doing something wrong?\nThanks\n\nA: You cannot remove the file because the group mygroup doesn't have write permissions on the file test.png as well as the folder. For write operations to work on the file the file permissions should look like:\n-rw-rwxr-- 1 otheruser   mygroup    159539 Apr 23 23:44 test.png*\n\nIf you take a closer look at the permission format\nduuugggooo\n\nThe first three placeholders uuu are user read, write and execute. The next three placeholders ggg are for the group and ooo for others. In the snippet posted by OP group is missing the write permission.\n\nA: Directories need x bit set (for directory that bit is seen as search bit) to open. So I use tree so I can get only the folder set and avoid the nightmare of having all the files set as executables ( the option for tree is  -d List directories only.):\nsudo tree -faid /mount/abc | xargs -L1 -I{} sudo chmod 755  \"{}\"\n\nWarning!!! you should have this into considerations:\n\n\n*\n\n*using chmod or chown recursive on root / directory or system directories will destroy your OS (actually anything recursive on / directory or system directories is dangerous)\n\n*this is not a good security practice to set permission bulk like that\n\nA: To add to the accepted answer (since I can't comment yet):\nIf you use software like BitVise to create a SSH connection to your server, simply closing & re-opening a terminal will not count as logging in & out. It will do things like reload your ~/.bashrc, but not perform the actual group updates (if you added the group in your \"login\" session).\nFor this to take effect you would have to fully logout and login again with your SSH-key/credentials.\n\nA: Did you recently add that user to that group, without logging out/in between? Then \"groups\" will show the group but the user does not have the group permissions yet.\nYou can show your effective groups using\n$ id\n\nAs an example, if I add my user ps to the group fax and then type\n$ id\n\nit does not show the group fax, but\n$ groups ps\n\nshows fax.\nDoing su to your own user gives you the new group affiliation:\n$ su ps\n$ id\n\nThe output now also contains fax.\n\nA: The method that you have used seems to be correct. I just now tried to replicate it, and it worked just fine.\nI am not sure if there is a typo, but there is a slight problem with the command. There is no need to have \"mygroup\" mentioned in there. The following works\n# chmod -R g+swrx /mount/abc\n\nEven, you can remove the s bit, just do g+rwx. After you have changed the permissions, and you do ls -l, it should display the relevant privileges.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 disappeared I downloaded Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit .iso from official Ubuntu site.

Any help?\n\nA: You have a GPT disk and no sign of a Windows boot loader installed on your EFI System Partition (ESP; your /dev/sda5), but Boot Info Script is reporting a BIOS-mode Windows boot loader installed on the disk's MBR. You do seem to have an EFI-mode version of GRUB on the disk. This combination makes me think that you started with an MBR disk, converted it to GPT, and installed Ubuntu in EFI mode. If I'm right about this, you won't get it to boot as it is, because Windows will boot only in EFI mode from a GPT disk, so you must first install an EFI boot loader for Windows. See this page for information on how to do this.

This morning I got a letter from my ISP saying that my Ubuntu Server (13.10) can be used as an \"open DNS resolver\".

The problem however is, that according to my whereabouts, I never installed an DNS server on the machine.\nAfter reading a bit more, I found out that DNSMasq is installed by default and people suggest securing it, but I can't find any config file whatsoever. When I run ps aux | grep dnsmasq, I do get:\nserver   21966  0.0  0.0   8172   952 pts/1    S+   09:09   0:00 grep --color=auto dnsmasq\n\nAlso, I have a feeling my OpenVPN service could have something to do with it.

If I don't manage to solve the issue, my ISP will disconnect me from the network.\n\nA: If you don't have any service for other user from internet on your server simple sudo ufw enable. Status of fw you can see with sudo ufw status. This will turn you firewall app with default deny all policy for inbound traffic.

A while ago, I  wrote an image on a USB drive using something along these lines:\ndd bs=4M if=/path/to/image.iso of=/dev/sdb && sync\n\nSomething must have gone terribly wrong there because after using the drive once or twice, Ubuntu didn't automount it anymore. So, I decided to overwrite the partition table first, since the image partition table is not a standard table. So I did:\ndd count=1 bs=512 if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb && sync\n\nAfter that, Ubuntu suddenly mounted the drive again and I could actually access the image. This is funny, since I basicaly erased the partition table. So, I tried:\ncfdisk /dev/sdb\n\nHowever, cfdisk shouted FATAL ERROR: cannot open disk drive. So, I tried gparted and created a new partition table. Now, the drive is automounted but I was suspicious of the whole thing, so I tried fsck.msdos and this is the very unsettling message I got:\nprompt@prompt:~$fsck.msdos /dev/sdb\ndosfck 3.0.12, 29 Oct 2011, FAT32, LFN,\nCurrently, only 1 or 2 FATs are supported, not 251.\n\nHowever, if I check the partition table with fdisk I get no error messages, nothing, just a clean table with one partition:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 4004 MB, 4004511744 bytes\n218 heads, 51 sectors/track, 703 cylinders, total 7821312 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00095e47\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1            2048     7821311     3909632    b  W95 FAT32\n\nSo, the only option I see now is zeroing out the first sector which is how all this started in the first place. I'm going to try zeroing the complete device and report back with results. Don't hesitate to give me other suggestions though.\n\nA: I fixed the same error using Kde-parted. \nI got this error and neither fsck.vfat nor dosfsck fixed it\nSo I made a new FAT, with before unmount, marked the partition, \nat top, device, make new FAT, or ctrl-shift-N.\nThen format made a new partition and everything worked normally again. \n\nA: Wipe the first mibibyte\nIt is usually enough to wipe (overwrite with zeros) the first mibibyte to get rid of data, that can confuse the programs that use or create partition tables and file systems.\nYou can do that with dd similar to what you did with the first 512 bytes. But dd is risky, so I would recommend mkusb, which 'wraps a safety belt around dd'. There are also other tools, that are safer than dd, for example Disks alias gnome-disks.\nZeroing out the whole drive should work, but it is slow, and will cause unnecessary wear of the memory cells. I use it only, when the drive is getting slow (in order to make it fast again and restore the margin to 'gridlock'. See this link: Pendrive lifetime\nCloning\nThe cloning process is very reliable, when done correctly with dd, mkusbor some other cloning tool.\nSo I think that your problem depends on the partition table and/or file systems, that come from the image file (image.iso), or was caused by a bad or incomplete shutdown, that corrupted the file system.\nYou must not unplug the USB drive while some partition on it is still mounted. It is important to let the system flush the buffers, finish writing data from RAM to the partition's file system.\n", "Q: Windows Boot Loader not letting GRUB be default Loader I have a HP Laptop which I dual booted with Windows 8 and Linux Ubuntu.

And go to 'nvidia-settings' to check under the nvidia-prime section if you can switch card.\n\nYou can also add an applet for unity to simply switch between cards : prime-indicator\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install prime-indicator\nsudo reboot\n\nMore info about the prime-indicator.\n\nA: Based on your xorg.conf it appears you are using the nvidia and not the Intel, hence:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\nIdentifier \"layout\"\nScreen 0 \"nvidia\"\nInactive \"intel\"\nEverything I can find indicates that the driver is broken in this configuration and you are better off just using the Intel.

Installing bumblebee will solve your issues most probably. Here\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\n", "Q: 2 linux partitions, how to force one's grub menu to win? I have 2 Ubuntu partitions\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 that is my desktop system\n\n*Kubuntu 14.04 that is my development enviroment\n\n\nEach time Ubuntu 14.04 updates the kernel, writes his own grub menu, and each time Kubuntu 14.04 updates the kernel, writes his own grub menu\nWhen Kubuntu 14.04 has written his own grub menu, how can I force Ubuntu 14.04 to gain again control of the grub menu (and I suppose of the MBR)?\n\nA: If I well understood you, you don't want Kubuntu to install GRUB. You may uninstall GRUB on Kubuntu:\nsudo apt-get remove grub-pc\n\n\nA: Boot back into Ubuntu and run \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nthis will reconfigure grub based on the partition where you are,\nafter this you could run\nsudo update-grub \n\nand it will update the menu defaulting to itself.\n", "Q: Preventing Déjà Dup from attempting a backup when out of my network I’ve set Déjà Dup to back up daily to my home network’s Synology NAS (by WebDAV, if you’re curious). \nThe problem is that my laptop comes with me to many places. My laptop does not seem to realise that it is not in my home network, and it tries (and fails ‘loudly’ tossing up windows with error messages & cetera) to make a backup. \nThis is not only silly (the backup process should at least be minimally context-aware), but also a potential security hazard (it is not hard to imagine a malicious user creating a host on a third-party network with the correct IP address to mimic that of my home NAS, and configure it to accept any login credentials whatsoever in order to obtain a fraudulent copy of my whole machine’s backup).\nThe question therefore is this: is there a way of preventing Déjà Dup from attempting a backup when it is not sure it is on my home network? This would seem to be a modest desire. (Then again, from what I read, it lacks even the rudimentary facility for allowing FTP login credentials to be passed, so maybe it’s not yet suitable for anything but the most trivial usage cases.)\n\nA: If the hostname for your NAS isn't reachable, Déjà Dup knows to wait.  If you are specifying the server by IP, try specifying it by hostname.\nAnd Déjà Dup should use FTP login credentials just fine.  Have you had troubles doing that?\n", "Q: From Terminal-1, Create new terminal, execute command (e.g: start JBoss), come back to Terminal-1 As Stated in the title, I want to start a new terminal from (say) Terminal-1. The new Terminal will execute a command (Say, start JBoss). And after starting JBoss, there will be JBoss log in Terminal-2, so i dont want to stay there as I have some other tasks to do. I want the control back to Terminal-1, so I can execute other commands. I am running script.\nExample scenario:\nRunning a script where i need to:\n(1) Install JBoss\n(2) Start JBoss\n(3) Deploy a code in jboss as.\nNOTE: Creating a new Terminal is not a problem. I can follow this. The problem is to come back to the primary terminal for executing further command.\n\nA: You can simply do :\ngnome-terminal -e jboss_command; exit;\n\nThat should close the new terminal as soon as the jboss_command finishes.\nHowever, you almost certainly don't want that. There is no reason to open a new terminal. Just run your command in the background:\njboss_command &\n\nIf that creates output, run it like this:\njboss_command &>/dev/null &\n\nThe & at the end makes a command run in the background, allowing you to keep using the terminal. &>/dev/null redirects standard error and standard output to /dev/null, it basically discards any messages printed by the command. So, running your jboss command like this will enable you to keep working on the same terminal while the command is running.\n\nA: I like using 'screen' for this sort of work. You can install it with sudo apt-get install screen and use it like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open new screen (terminal) with screen\n\n*Execute your command(s) in it\n\n*Detach it (temporarily exit) with 'ctrl+a' release keys and then press only 'd'\n\n*Optionally open another one and do some stuff there too, detach that one also\n\n*When you want to come back type screen -ls\n\n*And then reattach one you want with screen -r screen_name\nman screen for more!\n", "Q: How do I install Adobe Acrobat Reader from the repository?

Select the number that has Acrobat Reader. It will open Acrobat Reader and say it can't open '*.pdf'. Ignore that error and close Adobe Reader.

The setup is elaborate and runs a setuid-root binary, so only attempt this if you trust the firewall server and its administrator, and if you are otherwise confident in the security of the Gentoo host.\n\nsource: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SSL_Network_Extender#Download_the_client_install_script\n", "Q: copying my backup files I've made a backup.tgz file of all my work, which is now in the root directory.

I made the backup.tgz following a procedure from a couple of years ago, but don't have tech support any more. I'm working in an older version of Ubuntu, running Koha, wanting to upgrade to a newer version and backing everything up first, just in case.)\n\nA: Keep backup.tgz on dir you wish.

What program should I use and what filesystem?\nThe largest drives I ever had to map before are 2-3 TB and I always used fdisk for formatting. But fdisk is not working for drives larger than 2.1 TB.\nI would prefer that the whole volume is mounted as a single logical drive. We need to store large files in it, some may well pass 4TB.\nI have an HP ProLiant DL380p Gen8 server in my administration and configured two 1TB disks as a 1TB system drive and ten 4TB disks into a 30 TB drive using RAID 50. I installed Ubuntu Server 12.04.\nUPDATE:\nI used parted to relabel the partition table to GUID Partition Table (GPT) from msdos which is default for Ubuntu Server 12.04\nparted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt\n\nI then used parted to create an ext4 partition, which I later relabeled to xfs with: mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1. The rest went smoothly.\n\nA: You need to use the GUID Partition Table (GPT) on such a large disk. In Linux, there are two families of programs that support GPT:\n\n\n*\n\n*The libparted library, which is used by parted, GParted, and several others, supports both GPT and the older MBR.\n\n*The GPT fdisk family (gdisk, sgdisk, and cgdisk) is a GPT-only tool. It's installed as part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu.\n\n\nIn addition, fdisk has recently gained GPT support, but even Ubuntu 14.04 uses a version that's old enough that it lacks this support.\nAs to filesystems, XFS, JFS, and ext4fs can all handle such a big volume. So can Btrfs, but it's so new that I don't think I'd recommend it. Chances are this is a pretty important project, so you should research the differences between these filesystems for your specific needs.\n\nA: I'm sure there are others, but the JFS and XFS filesystems will both support the volume and file sizes you need.  Ubuntu has a Wiki Page on XFS that covers some pros and cons of XFS, one con being that GRUB doesn't support booting off an XFS volume (JFS is supported).  However, I don't imagine you're trying to boot off this RAID.\nYou can format large systems like that using parted and a gpt disk label (the msdos label supports up to 2 TB, like fdisk).  To install parted and create a single partition on your RAID (assuming it appears as /dev/sdb), run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install parted\nparted /dev/sdb\n  mklabel gpt\n  mkpart\n\nBeyond that, follow the prompts and you should be good to go.\nTo format the volume as XFS, you would run sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1.  Formatting JFS is similar: sudo mkfs.jfs /dev/sdb1.  To use JFS, you'll need to make sure jfsutils is installed.\n", "Q: Installing 'Kubuntu 14.04' I don't want to retain my WinXP so I downloaded 'Kubunu 14.04'.

I have a software that I have been developing in Python 3 for years. Until today, I have been using Ubuntu Desktop 11.04 but now I want to move to a higher version of Ubuntu.\nMust I stay on Ubuntu 11.04 so that I won't have to change parts of the source code of my software due to new changes in the higher versions of Ubuntu?\nWon't a recent Ubuntu version affect my software in any way ?\n\nA: Based on your comments, you successfully tested your software on VMs which is a good news.\nBut as an application developer you must be prepared to adapt your code to newer releases otherwise it will be quickly abandoned.  \nNow to ensure that it will continue to work with new releases of Ubuntu I strongly encourage you to maintain it as a package and provide a complete test suite for your application and call it during the build process of the package (e.g by calling setup.py test in your debian/rules override_dh_auto_test section).\nYou can easily set up daily builds of your package in a ppa using a bzr-builder recipe.\nThat way, you'll be notified of all build failures caused by new software versions or broken dependencies.\nNew releases are usually open for development a few days after the official release announcement. Look at our ppa page, Utopic is now part of the distro series we are building for:\n\n\nA: It is dependant on your code, If your code uses libraries that are not supported, you can't migrate to a newer version of an operating system easily, but most of the time no problem will occur.\n\nA: No, you should not stay on 11.04. It has been End of Life for support since October 2012. If you want any support at all, you need to upgrade, at least to 12.04 (which will be supported for three more years).\nAlso, even newer versions of of Ubuntu are including Python 3.x by default, with a goal of removing Python 2.x from the default install completely.\nYou may have issues with running your code under a newer version of Python 3.x, but should in general have no problems. You should also, as a developer, be prepared to deal with any such issues, regardless of what version of Ubuntu you are on. Any library you're using, or Python itself, could have a bug which your code depends on behaviorally, and if that bug is fixed, could cause your program to behave different from how you were expecting it to previously.\n\nA: Difficult to give a definitive answer without a description of your application. Since you're using Python3, at least you're not limited with the Python2.x branch (there will be no Python 2.8).\nNow a few warnings that may apply to your application, with Python3 a lot of packages are now deprecated just because the best way to access GLib/GObject/GIO/GTK+ is by using Python GObject Introspection (aka PyGI).\nFinally there's still some minor differences between the different python3 versions (e.g Argparse does not behave exactly the same with python 3.2 and 3.3.\nOne thing you could try is to boot a 14.04 VM and test your code with python3.4.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 has python3 packages, so that's not a problem. apt-cache search python3 will show them to you. Beyond that, you will have to read the release notes for each Ubuntu release between 11.04 and the \"higher version\", and search for a change that will break your application. Not knowing anything about your development requires me to shout YMMV, but my guess is that you will not have unsurmountable problems.\n\nA: As another answer, you can use virtual environment if you have any issue or you can use same version of python on 11.04 (download and build it) in 14.04.\n\nA: If you need to run an old version of Python on Ubuntu 14.04 then enable the deadsnakes repository. It has Python versions 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 for Ubuntu 14.04. If your application is pure Python code, and does not depend on the behaviour of other processes, then it should work fine running under an old interpreter.\n", "Q: Top menu bar is sliding down after hover I would like to hide a top menu bar.

Now When I try to install windows 8.1 it says windows can't be installed in GPT style partition. Some forums suggested that it is due to booting in legacy mode. So I changed the boot mode to UEFI. After this The BIOS won't detect my hard disk or USB stick. But the BIOS information page shows the hard disk is present. But booting won't work. It's trying to boot from network.\nPlease help me\n\nA: You need to install both your OSes in one mode -- either BIOS or EFI. Decide which to use and stick to it. Unfortunately, this can be tricky, since it's sometimes hard to control the boot mode. You can at least check this detail in Linux by looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi -- if it's present, you've booted in EFI mode, and if it's absent you've probably booted in BIOS mode. Trying to mix boot modes (BIOS for one OS, EFI for the other) can be done, but is almost always more trouble than it's worth.\nWindows ties boot mode to partition table type: To install to a GPT disk, you must install in EFI mode, and to install to an MBR disk, you must install in BIOS mode.\nThus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Decide whether you want to use BIOS or EFI.\n\n*Partition your disk appropriately.\n\n*Install Windows, being sure to boot your installation medium in the correct boot mode.\n\n*Install Ubuntu, being sure to boot your installation medium in the correct boot mode.\n\n\nDo not do a cross-mode installation except as a last resort.\nFor more on EFI-mode Linux installations, see the following sites:\n\n\n*\n\n*My page on EFI-mode Linux installations\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki on the topic\nOnce you know the rules and pitfalls, this isn't too hard. Unfortunately, there's a lot of flexibility, insufficient warnings in the Ubuntu installer to prevent you from making mistakes, and lots of bugs in EFI implementations that provoke making mistakes.\n\nA: Hello as a generic type answer here we go...!\nWin 8 is (I believe) exclusively uefi boot and it is Windows which causes the problems. One of these problems is that it always requires the first partions on the first disk to run/load. The second problem is that it does not recognise Linux partitions and may not see extended partitions at all [that's by the by].\nSo you will need to load Win again, mainly if not exclusively to your first partitions. Then you will have to reload Ubuntu, possibly after reading the notes about uefi dual booting.\nFeel free to completely delete this answer if my lack of actual Win 8 knowledge is too awful to view!\n", "Q: Symbolic Link Error with MySQL Cluster and Ubuntu 12.04 I want to install MySQL Cluster on Ubuntu and I followed this tutorial Install MySQL Cluster on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

However, an easy \"all in one\" solution, applicable in different situations and without any knowledge on, or feeling with coding is hard to give. You depend on the nature of the two states the script has to toggle between, their corresponding commands and the method you can use (or not) to check what is the current state.\nHaving said that, given your toggle hotspot example, below are three ready to use versions of a setup, from relatively simple to a bit more complicated. The first two are the most \"universal\" ones; the third is for use in Unity only.\nThe general \"anatomy\" of the toggle scripts is as follows:\n> check what is the current_status\n> if current_status = A:\n      (switch icon to icon_b)\n      run command to change state to B\n      (check if toggle command was successful, if not > switch icon back)\n> else:\n      (switch launcher icon to icon_a)\n      run command to change to change to A\n      (check if toggle command was successful, if not > switch icon back)\n\nToggle setup; the three examples\n\n\n*\n\n*Toggling with a single starter (desktop file) on your desktop. \n\n*Idem, but toggling icon as well, to show the current state\n\n*Toggling from an icon in the Unity launcher, with toggling icon to show the current state\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since you will be asked for your password, you need to install gksu if it is not on your system already.

I have tried to install Ubuntu 14.04, but unfortunately instead of creating a new partition, I chose the first option \"Erase everything\". I canceled it, but when I restart my PC, no operating system appears.\nCould you please help me?\n\nA: You will need to recover your partitions, and then attempt to re-install grub using boot-repair. Hopefully the data within the partitions is still intact.\nSteps:\nStep #1\nBoot an Ubuntu livecd\nStep #2\nIn terminal type \nsudo parted /dev/sda \n\n[This selects drive \"sda\", if you need a different drive then change appropriately.]\nStep #3\nIn Parted type \nrescue\n\n[To exit Parted type \"quit\".]\nStep #4\nInstall and run boot-repair. \n[I won't type all that out as the Ubuntu community already has an excellent set of instructions available here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair .]\nNotes:\nNote #1\nAttempting to recover deleted partitions doesn't always work, but it is always a risk. You could make things worse! If you have important data on the drive you are attempting to recover you should always perform a backup first. If you can't access the data use dd to make a sector based backup of the entire drive or partition and save it as a file.\nNote #2\nIf Parted fails to recover your partitions you can always try Gparted which also has a recovery feature. To install Gparted type \"sudo apt-get install gparted\" though it's often included on Ubuntu livecds. \nNote #3\nAfter successfully recovering your partitions instead of running boot-repair you could re-try using your Windows installation disc's repair feature as it might now work.\nSources:\nhttp#s://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nhttp://postbin.per.red/pages/article24/page.php\n\nA: Try to use ubuntu boot-repair; and, hopefully, your windows loader hasn't messed up.\nIf it doesn't work, you can try to use a recovery tool (usually vendors includes some recovery tools and recovery partition with the sold computer) to restore windows to a previous working state.\n\nA: Personally I'd suggest using Gparted over Parted since it's way easier, and it will search for all your partitions instead of you having to tell it where to find each one. That said if Gparted fails then Parted would be the next one to try because it allows you to specify where to search and works quite well. \nRegarding your comments on Mango's answer for using Parted. Ideally a start and end value would specify the span of the partition you wish to recover. If you have multiple partitions you will need to search multiple times. The value is done using megabytes by default. If you have 1 partition on your hard drive and your hard drive is 40 gigabytes then you'd use a start of \"0\" and an end of \"409600\". If you have 2 partitions then the second partition would have a start value matching the end value of the first partition. For example partition one start 0 end 204800 and partition 2 start 204800 and end 409600. Remember these are just approximates it's okay if your off. If you don't know the sizes then use something like start \"0\" and end \"500\" as this should at least find the first partition on the drive. However I recommend Gparted as a first try because you don't need to enter size and things.\nYou can find some other suggestions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\n", "Q: How can I restart GNOME Shell, after it freezes or becomes unresponsive? Sometimes, my GNOME Shell freezes. I can see (hear) background processes working (playing music), but I can't do anything in GNOME. No Alt+F2 followed by R and Enter.\nI can switch to console using: Ctrl+Alt+F1, login as the same user and execute:\ngnome-shell --replace\n\nand return back Ctrl+F7, but then, I get a strange behavior. For example I cannot edit network connections. I cannot logout as well. What is the proper way to restart the gnome-shell?\n\nA: Since you are not satisfied with gnome-shell --replace, you might want to try restarting the display manager itself.\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nI think that will kill other processes you are running.\nAlso refer http://worldofgnome.org/how-to-restart-gnome-shell-when-freezes-if-ever/ \nIf you are seriously into something that make you freeze everytime, enable the SysRq as mentioned in https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/sysrq.rst, and then give <alt><sysrq/print_screen_key><k> to kill whatever its there on the screen.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you want to ask \"nicely\" to gnome-shell to restart itsself, then you can call it's internal restart function over dbus with following command (assuming you have DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS env var set to the correct value and run as same user):\ndbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.gnome.Shell /org/gnome/Shell org.gnome.Shell.Eval string:'global.reexec_self()'\n\n\n*If you want to run a new instance, gnome-shell --replace should do fine. On console you need to define necessary environment variables like DISPLAY, DBUS* and so on. Refer to /proc/$gnome_shell_pid/environ\n\n*If you want to restart existing one, then killall -HUP gnome-shell will do it. If you do that too often though, gnome-shell might disable all extensions, forcefully log you off or otherwise behave in non-userfriendly manner.\n\n\nA: I do sometimes have the same problem as you describe, and my solution is:\nCtrl + Alt + F1, login as same user and execute:\nsudo pkill -9 ^gnome-shell\n\nAnd return back with Ctrl + Alt + F7\nIf this is the proper way, I don't know. For me it works everytime.\n\nA: Restart X\n\n\n*\n\n*First find which display manager your Ubuntu is using with following command:\ncat /etc/X11/default-display-manager\n\nin my case it's /usr/sbin/gdm3\nFrom Inside X or OUTSIDE X\n\n*For Method 1 to 4, find out which display you're using by using the w command.\nw\n\nthe answer may be for example tty3,  (therefor my (ack's) \"return to my display\" key is Ctrl+Alt+F3\nMethods\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F1 to exit, and Ctrl+Alt+F3 to bring one back\n\n*sudo /etc/init.d/gdm3 restart\n\n*systemctl restart gdm.service\n\n*sudo service gdm3 restart\n\n*dbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.gnome.Shell /org/gnome/Shell org.gnome.Shell.Eval string:'global.reexec_self()'\n\n*An easy way is just pressing Alt + F2, and type r then press Enter. This will work so long the shell isn't unusable.\n\n\nA: The easier way is just pressing Alt + F2, type r then Enter. This will work so long the shell is usable.\nYou can also send SIGQUIT to the gnome-shell process which will terminate only the shell:\nkillall -3 gnome-shell\n\nOther methods use more destructive means, which close all the applications, this shouldn't.\n\nA: The (currently) most upvoted answer by @Braiam misses some details. Some of the other answers didn't work for me. Hence, I am writing what did work for me. Note that this is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 running GNOME Shell 3.36.9.\n\n\n*If the current instance of GNOME Shell is still responsive, restart it with Alt + F2 → r → Enter. This should work in most cases. But once in a while, the shell may become completely unresponsive, or even this command may get stuck. In that case, go on to the following steps.\n\n\n*Go to a TTY. On my system, the key combination would be Ctrl + Alt + F3 to F6.\n\n\n*Log in. (Note that in TTY, number keys on numeric keypad may not work!)\n\n\n*Find the PID of GNOME Shell using pidof gnome-shell.\n\n\n*Kill it using sudo kill -1 <pid> replacing <pid> with the output of the above step. (If you don't use sudo, you will get the Operation not permitted error.)\n\n\n*Re-execute step 3. If nothing is returned, then GNOME Shell has not yet restarted. Keep repeating step 3 until you get the PID of the new instance of the shell. (Note that this PID will not be the same as what you had got in step 3.)\n\n\n*Once the PID of the new shell instance is returned, you can safely return to the GUI. Type exit and log out of the TTY.\n\n\n*Return to the GUI. In Ubuntu 20.04, this is achieved using Ctrl + Alt + F2.\nThis method did not close any of the applications that were running. Unsaved changes in such applications still existed without any problem. All GNOME extensions were loaded properly too.\n\nA: If you have installed ubuntu gnome, which you should have, you might be using the gnome display manager. In that case you should change to another TTY, like Ctrl + Alt + F4 and then\nsudo service gdm restart\n\nI also wrote an article about such situation recently:\nHelp, my Linux Desktop hangs!\nBest Luck!\n\nA: Here is a different workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in a local terminal by pressing CTRL+ALT+F1.\n\n*Run the command: \nsudo kill -HUP $(pidof gnome-shell)\n\n\n*Return to the graphical interface by pressing CTRL+ALT+F7.\n\n\nPS: I'm using lightdm instead of gdm3.\n\nA: *\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F2 to switch to a terminal window. Sometimes, this is\nnot possible.\n\n*Press Alt+SysRq+R to get the keyboard.\n\n*If pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2 before failed, try it again now.\n\n*Press Alt+SysRq+E to terminate all processes.\n\n*Press Alt+SysRq+I to kill all processes.\n\n*Press Alt+SysRq+S to sync your disks.\n\n*Wait for OK or Done message. If you don't see a message, look at your HDD light to see if Sync made a difference.\n\n*Press Alt+SysRq+U to unmount all disk drives.\n\n*Wait for OK or Done message. If you don't see a message in 15-30    seconds, assume disks are unmounted (or that an unmount is not    possible) and proceed.\n\n*Press Alt+SysRq+B to reboot.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 20.04 if you have ssh enabled on the affected computer.\n\n*\n\n*ssh into the affected computer from a remote computer\n\n*execute killall -1 gnome-shell without sudo.\n\nThere's a bit of lag at the start when logging as it is re-instantiating all gnome objects be patient; but most if not all running programs should continue working.\n\nA: kill -15 gnome-shell does not work for me but kill -9 does. I think it is because kill -9 triggers a segfault which triggers gnome-shell to restart itself, while kill -15 does not.\n", "Q: Mouse slow proportionally to network usage Under ANY network loading the Logitech mouse gets slow. At download speeds of as low as 50KB/s, clicks are \"grabby,\" a click will pick up an object and any movement will move it around. At rates above 150KB/s, the mouse barely moves. Network loading from web browsing and torrent downloads affect the mouse, I haven't looked into it any further then that.\nComputer:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD Phenom 8450 (tri-core @ 2 ghz)\n\n*Ram: 6 GB\n\n*Dual monitors (HD TV using HDMI, and a Dell Monitor (Portrait mode) on analog.\n\n*Logitech Wireless mouse/keyboard (using default/automatic Ubuntu driver)\n(Microsoft USB Mouse)\n\n*Fast Ethernet connection\n\n\nThe wireless keyboard does not appear to be affected. Repeatable on 13.10 and 14.04 (Desktop).\nInterestingly, when I add the Microsoft USB mouse, that mouse works fine. In fact, that Logitech mouse intermittently may work better (or not) when the second mouse is plugged in.\n\nA: I strongly suspect the network load itself is not the issue here. More likely, it's the network activity's effect on your HDD (as data is read and written to it). Try doing some intensive HDD activities, checking the mouse symptoms under load.\nWriting a large file via dd is a simple solution.

I can't believe that there was not a question or open issue for this before.\nI've recently installed ubuntu 14.04 along with my favourite webapps; and I, unfortunately, realised that they're not integrated with firefox/chromium anymore. Instead, they use a minimal browser which I am not interested in.\nWithin the few reasons why I'm still using unity and I haven't moved to gnome or xfce, it's the unity-webapps. I haven't known any other OS or Desktop Environment (DE) which integrates the internet webapps in the computer and, at same time, keeps the power of the web-browser and the computer-using style.\nI loved to be able to have tens of opened tabs & to be in one-click far away to my facebook tab. And I loved to create new tabs in the same windows that I used to have my open webapp. No mention of all the capabilities which firefox provides me...\nSo, is there any workaround to get back the unity-webapps integrated in firefox/chromium?\nI've already checked the system settings and the unity tweak tool with no luck.\nThe major issue of the unity-webapps was there are few of them, they need more features and more stability.\nIf ubuntu doesn't fix this, I'll strongly think in moving to another DE. C'mon Canonical, I'm not using a tablet, I have got 6GB of RAM and I want to see many apps and many pages at the same time.\nEDIT - I have reported a bug in launchpad for this issue:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/libunity-webapps/+bug/1329046\nEDIT - My proposal of solution: The solution might be archieved following the path I'm describing below. I can only show it, somebody has to walk through it.\n\n\n*\n\n*get the source for 14.04 unity-webapps\n\n*edit the place where webapp-browser is changed to be by default for unity-webapps inside libunity-webapps.\n\n*Compile again the code for 14.04 and post the output package here.\n\n\nThe source for libunity is hosted here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/trusty/libunity-webapps\n\nA: Your solution got me thinking. It might be very easy to edit out their mistakes. Now... \nDisclaimer: I don't use webapps. I installed Youtube for the purpose of solving this issue. This may not work with all webapps, you will have to try each one and post in comments so we can work it out together if you can't on your own. I post this as an answer because comments are way to short.\nLet's start from the top, the command you call to run a webapp is called unity-webapps-runner. I don't know how it operates, I don't know how to fix it. What I do know is that you can very easily replace it with a bash script that launches Firefox. I am not a pro bash scripter, but this works:\n#!/bin/bash \nfor i; do \nif [[ $URL = \"1\" ]]; then\nfirefox $i;\nexit;\nfi\nif [[ $i = \"-d\" ]]; then\nURL=\"1\";\nfi\ndone\n\nWhat the script does is that it will wait until the -d argument appear and take the next argument as a URL for Firefox.\nSave this file in your ~/ directory as unity-webapps-runner and make it executable. Rename unity-webapps-runner in /usr/bin/ to something like unity-webapps-runner-classic. I presume you know you need root permissions for these actions and I presume you have knowledge concerning these particular procedures. Paste your ~/unity-webapps-runner to /usr/bin/ and try to launch a webapp, Youtube first to see that I haven't tricked you.\nThat should be it. Now it will launch a tab/new window in Firefox instead of the Ubuntu Browser. You could ofc replace firefox in the bash script with chromium or google-chrome or any other browser to make them launch instead.\n\nA: Ok at least for chromium this can be solved (somehow):\njust change the line in \n/usr/share/applications/<yourwebapp>.desktop\n\nthat says \nExec=unity-webapps-runner ...\n\nto:\nExec= chromium-browser --app=http://mail.google.com (for gmail)\n\nI think it is best to move the desktop file to ~.local/share/applications and uninstall the corresponding webapp completely, since the desktop file does imo everything the whole webapp does...\nI'm sure there's something similar for firefox\n\nA: I have been researching this to, as i didn't want Chrome/Chromium, but it seems that it's not going to work with Firefox anymore.\nThey 'dropped it'.\nhttp://linux.softpedia.com/blog/canonical-drops-all-ubuntu-specific-firefox-extensions-492676.shtml\n", "Q: If I convert my Ubuntu into Xen hypervizor, will I lose access to the bcache devices? I'd like to test Xen a little. For obvious reasons I cannot do it under VirtualBox (or can I?) \nAs I understand, Xen works by changing the kernel, thus possibly interfering with the custom kernel modules I have, namely with bcache.\nI'd appreciate an information, whether after doing \nsudo apt-get install xen-system-amd64 qemu-common qemu-keymaps bridge-utils\n\nand then rebooting, will the system load the bcache module, as it does without xen?\nI have no possibility to back up my 12+ TB RAID array, so I can't test it myself.\n\nA: Xen does not change the kernel; it is a hypervisor that sits below the kernel.  Grub loads xen, and your normal kernel and xen creates a virtual machine to run that kernel in.  This initial virtual machine has acess to all of the real hardware and ram ( that xen itself isn't using ) on the system, so the kernel operates just as it normally does.  It just has the option to give up some ram and have xen create a new virtual machine and load a new kernel there, while normally only providing the new virtual machine with emulated hardware that is is passed back to the initial vm to handle.\n", "Q: How do I revert back my changes in compiz opacity settings?

Under Microsoft Windows 8, our Sony VAIO Tap 20 (a touch-screen desktop computer) automatically displays an on-screen keyboard if one touches a text field on-screen or there is otherwise no keyboard available (for example, the included bluetooth keyboard is switched-off or flat)... There is also a (notification area/system tray-based) option to display or hide the on-screen keyboard on-demand.\nDoes such functionality exist under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (\"Trusty Tahr\")?\nMy understanding is that Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (\"Trusty Tahr\") is supposed to be a mostly smartphone/tablet-focused upgrade...

See below\nsudo apt-get remove --purge resolvconf && sudo apt-get install --reinstall resolvconf\n\nIt appears that your upgrade as my did not properly install your DNS resolver.\n\nA: Your DNS servers are not set or not working properly.\nA DNS server basically translates (resolves) a domain name (like google.com) to an IP address. Without an IP address you can't connect to any website. So if a domain name can't be resolved, you can't access any website.\nYou can use Google's DNS servers to solve this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the WiFi icon in the top right of your screen\n\n*Click on Edit connections...\n\n*Under Wi-Fi, select your network's name\n\n*Click on Edit...\n\n*Click on IPv4 Settings\n\n*Set Additional DNS Servers to 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 (note the difference between the dot and the comma)\n\n*Click on Save\nTry to visit Google to verify that your connection's working.\n", "Q: Boot Problem - Cannot Install Edubuntu I have an old Toshiba laptop I'd like to put Edubuntu on.  I first made a DBAN disc to wipe the drive.  It was burned with Imgbrn software and booted fine.  I also made an Edubuntu disc in the same manner, but it will not boot.  The disc image file is from the Edubuntu website.  \nI then formatted a flash drive to make it bootable and used the Universal USB Installer at pendrivelinux.com to put Edubuntu on the flash drive.  \nThe boot menu on the bios is set to 1) CD/DVD 2) Removable media, 3) Hard drive, 4) Network.  When the computer starts, it recognizes the flash drive, but when it cycles through the boot process, it gets to the last in the list as evidenced by the PXE error that eventually comes up when it can't find a network connection.  \nI know the computer can boot from disc as it booted the DBAN disc when I wiped the hard drive.  I don't know why it will not boot Edubuntu either from disc or from a flash drive.  This is my first experience with any Linux-based OS.

The first time I tried everything went, more or less, right, but later, I had some issues, so I had the genius idea of deleting the .ssh folder and all the relative keys inside and restarting everything from scratch. The result is that now I am not even able to register the new keys on the server and I do not know what to try anymore!\n$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@server.example.com\n\nasks me for my passphrase, which doesn't recognize, terminating with something like\nPermission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)\n\nThank you in advance!!\n\nA: AFAIK, once you register to a website with a public key, you need to use the same keys if you want the same identity on a different computer. When you create a new ssh key with the same user id, its different from the one you created previously, because it uses random data to create a key pair.\nIf you have .ssh folder from the first computer which you created the keys and registered it, simply copy it to the second machine and it should work fine. Once you have that folder, you can give the same password and you should be authenticated.\n", "Q: Skype and dropbox installation problems and Nvidia problems hi guys  i recently installed the new LTS OF Ubuntu ( 14.04) and i am having problems installing Skype and Dropbox.

I have access to the MAC address and signal strength. He's not jamming my network, but he is bridging my wireless network. I want to connect to his network and figure out what he's doing. Any advice or resources will be appreciated.\n\nA: Kismet can be used to capture and dump the raw wifi traffic, including the SSID. You can then parse the data dump through your favorite language using an available PCAP library. You could then convert the SSID to something more human friendly like hex, octal, or ASCII code values OR you could exec() iwconfig from there. An example in Perl of parsing via PCAP.\nI was going to leave this second part in a comment to the original question, but I do not have enough rep: You might have better luck in finding out what the intruder is doing by monitoring the traffic on your own network that is coming across the bridge.\n\nA: It is possible to use unprintable characters in a SSID (it supports UTF-8) and a 32-byte string of NULL-bytes is a valid SSID (that would be an invisible SSID).\n", "Q: Boot (possibly MBR) messed up after updating from 12.04 to 14.04 now, before you tell me to use the search function for this (common) issue - i did work an this for the last 5 hours and i am getting to no (close) solution.\nThis is the exact problem:\nAfter updating my 12.04 to 14.04 yesterday booting ended up in the GRUB rescue prompt. So i did what i did often before when facing boot problems (and it worked every time until yesterday!): i got a live usb-device installed and ran boot-repair but this time this made it worse: my bios is now not even recognizing the hard-drive (SATA) as bootable.\nRunning boot-repair a few times more with different settings did not help. Then i searched all the forums and wikis on how to install grub manually and what i found was this:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into a live system\n\n*mount the 'broken' system, especially the /sys, /proc and /dev directories\n\n*chroot into this system\n\n*(re-)install the correct grub-package (which is grub-efi-amd64 for me)\n\n*run update-grub\n\n*exit the chroot\n\n*reboot\n\n\nBut this still leaves me with my hard-drive not beeing recognized (and as a result with a \"operating system not found\" error)\n. The partitioning is the following:\n/dev/sd?\n  /dev/sd?1: 94MB, flags: boot, fat16\n  /dev/sd?2: 2GB, linux-swap\n  /dev/sd?3: ~260GB, ext4, the rest of the ubuntu 14.04\n\nAs of my naive view, i always thought this is the way it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*My bios sees the hard-drive and the partition with the boot flag\n\n*The bios (whether efi or legacy does not matter to me, it has to work) launches grub there\n\n*Grub loads the linux-kernel from the third partition\n\n\nI insist on the separate boot-partition because - as i said - this is not the first time for me to experience big issues with GRUB. The separate partition made solving it easier for me.\nI'll - of course - provide any information neccessary. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: It is grub-install you need to run, not update-grub, which just rebuilds the menu.  Since it looks like you are using efi, you also have to mount the efi system partition in /boot/efi before you chroot into your root partition.\n\nA: The procedure i posted above is not correct in detail. I assume this only works for (U)EFI boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into a live system\n\n*mount the 'broken' system, especially the /sys, /proc and /dev directories\n\n*If a separated boot-parition is to be used, mount it to /boot/efi\n\n*chroot into the mounted system\n\n*(re-)install the correct grub-package (which is grub-efi-amd64 for me)\n\n*run grub-install --force with the boot partition as parameter (e.g. grub-install /dev/sdb1)\n\n*run update-grub\n\n*exit the chroot\n\n*reboot\n\n", "Q: File location on Ubuntu 14.04 I'm running Ubuntu 14.04. I'd like to know where do the files of a certain installed program go.\nIn windows, for example, you go to the C:\\Programe Files\\name of the specific program folder.\nHow do you find these files in Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can install Synaptic. Open a Terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and run:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nAfter that open Synaptic from the dash or form terminal by typing gksu synaptic and first go to Settings -> Preferences and check this box:\n\nNow follow the steps in the image:\n\n\nA: Executables can go into /bin, or /usr/local/bin, etc.\nTo get the exact location of where you can find executables, open up a terminal, and type \necho $PATH\n\nSimilarly, libraries (similar to windows DLLs) go into something like /lib. /usr/lib, etc.\nFile system hierarchy is different in linux, and there are no \"Program files\" folder as such, though you can optionally have them when manually installing (other than software center, synaptic or apt).\n", "Q: How do I Install Retrospect backup client on 14.04? Retrospect Backup client require 32-bit libraries. On the 12.04 LTS I would install ia32-libs. That is no longer an available package and it appears that I must determine more precisely what libraries are needed for this closed-source app. The vendor doesn't support Ubuntu, just RedHat.\n\nA: To create the package follow the steps below.\nsudo apt-get install alien\nsudo alien -g --scripts linux_client-7_7_100.rpm\ncd retroclient-7.7.100\nsudo vim debian/control\n# change the Architecture from i386 to amd64 on line 7\n# add libstdc++6:i386 to the Depends line separated by a comma on line 8\n# see below if this is confusing\nsudo debian/rules binary\n\nThat drops retroclient_7.7.100-2_amd64.deb in the same directory as you originally ran alien from. If I were you I'd rename that retroclient_Ubuntu144.deb since it is Ubuntu 14.04+ specific. It might work on 13.10. I forget when they changed the 32-bit stuff.\nTo install from your newly created .deb package run this procedure. \nIf you can remember the package name exactly and remember to install libstc++:i386 ahead of time, you can skip the second step and install the dependency first. I'm sure I usually won't remember so this expects my failure and integrates it. \n#This will fail with the dependency issues if you haven't resolved them yet.\nsudo dpkg -i retroclient_7.7.100-2_amd64.deb\n\n#This will install the dependencies and automatically take you back to configuring RetroClient.\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n#This will check the status to confirm it setup the startup scripts and started rcl.\nsudo service rcl status \n\nLook at you, you beautiful, smart person you. You defeated the system and installed the retrospect client on a system that the vendor doesn't support.

Failed to mount Windows share: Permission denied.  Yet permissions were established in the share. \nCan anyone help figure this out?\n\nA: Ubuntu isn't capable of changing permissions on NTFS drives.

In one of those accounts, I have a virtual machine in VirtualBox. I would like to share that virtual machine with the other users of the computer. How can I do it?\n\nA: The idea\nTo make a VM available from different user accounts on one computer (not having it running at the same time), you need to set up a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the virtual hard drive of the shared machine in a directory where different users have appropriate permissions.\n\n*Create virtual machines on the different accounts, using that same virtual hard drive.\n\n\nHow it can be done\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a shared folder, in your personal home folder, for you and other user(s):\n\n\n*\n\n*Make other users member of the group yourusername (the easiest way is to install gnome-system-tools and use the users and groups -section. \nManage groups > choose_yourusername > properties > add_other_users\n(detailed instructions here to mange users, and here to create a shared folder)\n\n*Change the permissions of the folder; right-click on in nautilus. In the permissions tab, change the group permissions for group yourusername to read & write.\n\n*Change the permissions for the files in the folder similarly (the button down in the nautilus properties window).\n\n\n*Create a virtual machine in VirtualBox. Do not use the default directory for a disk, but browse to the shared folder and save the disk image there. If you have an existing VM, delete it, delete its folder in ~/VirtualBox VMs as well, but keep its disk image, and move it to the shared folder first, then create a new VM, using the existing image as a harddisk. (if you try to relink the disk image in your existing VM, VirtualBox will complain the UUID already exists).\n\n*On the other user's account(s), create similar machines, but use the hard disk image in the shared directory: /home/yourusername/shared_folder/machine_name.vdi (depending on the diskimage you created)\n\n\nA: it's easier to just set file permissions for particular VM for user group.\nI doesn't matter where it is, you don't have to delete and redo anything.\nIn my case it was in my \\home\\ folder and I just set file permissions to read/write for user group where the other user was.\nThen log in as this other user, enter Virtualbox > Machine > Add  and navigate to vmdk (or other format) file of this particular VM.\nNo issues. No idea why you need to create new VM.\n\nA: to share the VM to other users \nthe idea is simply to create a new virtual machine on every user login and give it a different name. so  When you get to the part about a new or existing hard drive select the existing VM from my login and finished the new set-up. This causes a new .xml file to be created in ~/.VirtualBox/Machines/YourVMname folder. This .xml file holds the config settings for the VM you are running. \nREF: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=798011\n\nA: You mean that you want to be able to run the VM from more users? It must be easy.\nFind the directory of the VM.\nOpen VirtualBox on every user account and add VM with the existing virtual drive. (/home/(Username of the person who created the vm)/Virtualbox\\ VMs)\n", "Q: After clean install of 14.04 there are no Nvidia drivers available I performed a clean install of 14.04LTS 64bit on a brand new Intel 730 SSD. The install went OK, but I was not aware that the Ubuntu Devs decided to install (without any warning) the open source Nouveau video driver instead of the proprietary Nvidia driver (as they have in past LTS releases). Once I realized this, I went to the Software Updates \"Additional Drivers\" tab to install the Nvidia 331.xx driver for my PNY 750Ti card. The driver search came back totally empty -- no Nvidia drivers listed at all! No message explaining what was going on either, just an empty box. I tried changing the mirror from the main Ubuntu US mirror to the Columbia University, NYC mirror and got the same result. I also tried to install the Nvidia driver via Synaptic Package Manager and on a reboot I could not login because no LighDM login screen appeared.  I gave up and went back to 12.04.4 LTS.\nI hope the Ubuntu Devs have a good explanation for this new and unwelcome behavior. Is there an way to install 14.04LTS/64 and get the Nvidia driver installed from the beginning? If so, how?\n\nA: Try using the command:\nubuntu-drivers devices | grep recommended\n\nThis should give you the driver set needed and then just use the apt-get install command to install that driver set.\n\nA: Just install the prime driver post-install.

It is used when you run out of RAM.\nTo install Ubuntu you need / partition and /swap. /home is optional but recommended.\nSo, in Windows right click Computer, then Manage and select Disk management. Delete or shrink the last partition and leave a minimum of 15 GB unallocated space (for a decent install).\nAfter that boot from an Ubuntu DVD/USB and when greeted with the partitioning options select Something Else. Click the Unallocated space and press New button. Select at the end and use as swap. Let it be as much or a little more than your RAM.\nNow click again the unallocated space and press New button and create an ext4 partition mounted as /.\nIf you want /home partition then leave some space from it and create it by choosing mount point /home and ext4 type.\n\nA: If you have a spare partition you want to install ubuntu onto then do an automatic install where Ubuntu will setup all the partitions it needs for you using the one you gave it alongside your Windows install...\n/home is where programs store local data and settings and your own files separate from the ubuntu filesystem itself...\n/swap is the partition it uses as extra memory when your computer runs out of actual hardware memory, it's a lot slower since it's using the hard-drive...\n\nA: /swap isn't really necessary if you've RAM more than 2GB. Its used by Ubuntu in case it runs out of (RAM) memory.\n/home is similar to the C:\\Users directory in Windows where the files and settings of every individual users are stored. You do not need to create a separate partition for home if you don't wish to. Ubuntu should be able to create a /home directory in the same partition as /.\n", "Q: nvidia-settings crash while on Intel graphics I've added the xorg-edgers PPA using sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa. Then I've tried different packages, all with the same problem. I'm currently using nvidia-331 as it's working almost perfectly.\nThe only problem that's left is that nvidia-settings is working perfectly when I'm using nVidia graphics, but as soon as I switch to Intel graphics (I'm on a notebook with nVidia Optimus) nvidia-settings won't open (it crashes instantly). Executing nvidia-settings in the terminal only gives me:\n** Message: PRIME: Requires offloading\n** Message: PRIME: is it supported? yes\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nI used the following commands to install nvidia-331:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia*\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nI can't use the nVidia drivers in Ubuntu's repository as the performance is horrible on my Notebook. However, nvidia-settings never had those problems using Ubuntu's repository.\nUpdate: seems to be a bug (LP #1214508). However, they claim all packages >= 319 are affected, but it was working just fine using nvidia-331 from Ubuntu's repository.\n\nA: I have exactly the same issue. If I remove all the Nvidia packages and Prime and re-install and then reboot without changing anything I get access to the Nvidia settings. As soon as I swap to the IGP I can no longer swap back to the discrete GPU.\nI have tried with different nvidia drivers and it is exactly the same result. Initially I was getting ACPI errors in the logs but now it just logs the Segment Faults (error 4 in libc-2.19.so).\nAny ideas?\n\nA: My experience is that anything from xorg-edgers PPA is just for those who really knows to fix their system. I spent a lot of time doing so (reverting packages).\nTherefore I really recommended removing this PPA after you install the latest NVIDIA driver.\nBy the way: I'm reverted back from 337/334 to 331.38 nvidia version (from standard 14.04 repository) since I need CUDA and OpenCL support.\nNow back to the topic:\n- I don't think that we, as a NVIDIA proprietary driver users, can do anything about the buggy NVIDIA PRIME tools.\nHow to revert back to your discrete NVIDIA card:\n1.) \"sudo prime-select nvidia\" proposed by Louis Matthijssen worked in my case.\nOf course I logged out and in afterwards.\n2.) Another \"solution\" would be switching from NVIDIA Optimus to \"Discrete card\" in your BIOS (if you have there such an option).\n    (not tested)\n", "Q: How to open several image files from command line, consecutively, for editing? Lets say I have three image files to edit. Consider all the files are in ~/Pictures. Let name of the first file be 1.svg, name of the second file be 2.svg and name of the third file be 3.svg .I have Inkscape editor. Now, I want a bash script to be executed so that the following must happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*First 1.svg must open for me to edit.\n\n*After editing, when I close that file, automatically 2.svg must open for me to edit.\n\n*Now when I complete editing 2.svg, I want 3.svg to open for editing. \n\n*Now after editing 3.svg the script must end by closing GIMP.\n\n\nPS:- If you are wondering if this is home work, it is not! See here . You will notice that I have to edit images there. To make that answer better I need help here. So please help. Also I AM A COMPLETE BEGINNER. I don't know anything about bash. So explain your answer as elaborately as possible. Also you might consider giving an answer with GIMP editor to edit .jpg files . It might be useful for others. By the way, I am using 14.04 LTS . Thanks in advance. \nUPDATE :- The above linked answer was edited according to the accepted answer below.\n\nA: As Rmano says, you can simply do a for loop in the terminal:\nfor i in 1.jpg 2.jpg 3.jpg; do gimp $i; done\n\nEither run this in the directory where the files are, or each file should have the rest of the path to it. You can put as many files as you want in there.\nGIMP will open the file, you edit it, and then close GIMP. Once GIMP closes, the for loop continues and opens the next file in the list.\nIf you don't want to close GIMP every time, you can try adding a read -p:\nfor i in 1.jpg 2.jpg 3.jpg; do gimp $i && read -p \"Press [Enter] key to continue...\"; done\n\nOnce you finish editing a file, you should be able to press Enter in the terminal and the next file should open in GIMP, without having to close GIMP.\nThis is the simplest way I could think of, it may get complicated trying to detect when GIMP closes a file.\nNote for your case\nMost of the files are SVG files, as Rmano pointed out. So list all of your SVG files and replace gimp with inkscape. The PNG files will be fine with gimp.\n\nA: The following command opens the files in the default associated application:\nedit 1.svg 2.svg 3.svg\n\nIf you want to open all the .svg files in alphabetical order, you can use the * wildcard:\nedit *.svg\n\n* stands for any sequence of characters, so you can use it in other ways; for example, to successively open the .svg files whose name contains wibble:\nedit *wibble*.svg\n\nOther wildcards exist if you want to select files based on finer-grained patterns.\n\nA: You could try something like this:  \nshopt -s nullglob\nfor i in *\ndo\n    if [ -d \"$i\"  ]\n     then\n        continue\n    else\n        inkscape \"$i\"\n\n    fi\ndone\n\nI tested it on my Pictures directory and it seemed to work.\nI don't entirely understand the first line yet, but it is there to help make sure my * works. The for loop then loops through everything in the current directory one at a time. If it isn't a directory it opens it in Inkscape for editing. \nWhen you're done editing and close inkscape the next image will open until there are no more images.\n\nFor your specific case (after reading the linked question) this might work better. Remember to cd to /usr/share/unity/icons and then run this:  \nfor i in file1.svg file2.svg file3.svg\ndo\n    if [ -d \"$i\"  ]\n     then\n        continue\n    else\n        inkscape \"$i\"\n\n    fi\ndone  \n\nreplacing file1.svg file2.svg file3.svg with a list of the files you want to edit.  \n", "Q: What is the meaning of the words with underline in a man page? For most commands that I have seen, there are some underlined words in their man page. What is the meaning of this underline? Is that a link? If yes, how we can go there?\n\nA: Most underlined words in man pages are for emphasis. Its is not a hyperlink .\n\nA: also from man man page\n   italic text        replace with appropriate argument.\n   [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.\n   -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.\n\n   argument ...       argument is repeatable.\n   [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.\n\n   Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance,\n   man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a termi‐\n   nal, and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.\n\n\nA: Italics (emphasis; as clearly answered above, they are usually displayed underlined, unfortunately) are used in several sections of a manual page for different purposes.\nIn the synopsis, boldface is used for as-is text and italics are used to\nindicate  replaceable  arguments.\n\nFor  manual  pages  that describe a command (typically in Sections 1 and 8),\nthe arguments are always specified using italics, even in the SYNOPSIS section.\n\nFor manual pages that describe functions (typically in Sections 2  and  3),\nthe arguments  are  always  specified  using  italics, even in the SYNOPSIS section,\nwhere the rest of the function is specified in bold:\n\n       int myfunction(int argc, char **argv);\n\nVariable names should, like argument names, be specified in italics.\n\nGeneral formatting conventions:\nIf  the  command is short, then it can be included inline in the text, in italic\nformat, for example, man 7 man-pages.  In this case, it may be worth using  non‐\nbreaking  spaces  (\"\\ \")  at  suitable  places  in the command.  Command options\nshould be written in italics (e.g., -l).\n\nExpressions, if not written on a separate indented line, should be specified  in\nitalics.  Again, the use of nonbreaking spaces may be appropriate if the expres‐\nsion is inlined with normal text.\n\nConsult man-pages(7) for more details.\n", "Q: command line app to burn part of a long .wav to audio cd I have a 7-hour wav file (recording of rain sounds), and I'd like to burn a CD from it. \nHow can I burn as much as it as will fit onto a standard audio cd so that it will play continuously for the 50mins or so that a CD usually plays for on my ancient CD player?\nI'd prefer to be able to do this from the command line.\n\nA: Use ffmpeg\nffmpeg -ss 00:00:00 -t 01:00:00 -i your.wav -acodec copy short.wav\n\nAdjust the time ( -t ) until the file is about 700 Mb\n", "Q: I need help finding my USB connected devices How do i get the USB device connected to my computer to show my connected devices if i am running a virtual version of Ubuntu 14.04.

In my case I cannot get light locker settings to open at all.\nI wanted to disable this feature as it keeps interrupting my music stream.  I am brand new to Linux.  I have an Asus Eee901 netbook, With 2 GB of Ram, 128 SSD with Xubuntu 32 bit installed on it.\nI use a netbook for web browsing and I use Google Chrome and streaming Spotify, and that is about it.  Also, would Lubuntu allow me to use Spotify to stream?\nThanks in advance...\n\nA: There are a few reported bugs with lightlocker giving blank screens (e.g. after unlock after lid close).\nMy suggestion for a work around is to remove light locker and install Gnome screensaver or X screensaver instead.\nTo remove light locker run the following command:\n    sudo apt-get purge light-locker light-locker-settings\nTo install Gnome screensaver:\n    sudo apt-get install gnome-screensaver\nOR\nTo install X screensaver:\n    sudo apt-get install xscreensaver\n\nA: FROM: http://xubuntu.org/news/screen-locking-in-xubuntu-14-04/\nWhat happened to my music playback?\nAs your seat becomes inactive, your audio stream is stopped/paused until you log into your session again. This is one of the known issues of light-locker or locking with LightDM in general.\nCurrently, when locking, it is assumed you are either:\n\n\n*\n\n*in a public space of sorts (the desktop at home hardly needs\nlocking) and have walked away from the machine\n\n*using a system with more than one user\n\n\nStopping/pausing playback in both of these scenarios make sense.\nHowever, this might be an annoying change for users used to having their music playback continue even when their session locks. If you don’t like this behavior, there are basically two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set light-locker to lock the session “When the screensaver is\ndeactivated”\n\n*Switch back to using xscreensaver\n\n*Add your user to the “audio” group on your computer and  music\nplayback will continue also with light-locker\n\n\nThe first option is a good workaround, because it means that your audio-playback will continue when the screen has been blanked. However, when you wake up your computer, e.g. by touching the mouse, it will pause the music until you log into your session again.\nThe third solution is mentioned last, because it isn’t advised to add your user to the “audio” group (read The Audio Group wiki page for a comprehensive explanation). However, as long as you’re on a single-user system, this might still be an option for you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 setup for Canoscan 9000 Mark II How do I get sane to work on Ubuntu 14.04 with a USB 3 connected Canoscan 9000F Mark II scanner\nlsusb shows the device as a Canon Device 0x04A9/0x190d. \nI added this device to /etc/sane.d/canon-dr.conf\nscanimage -d test -T works with all passes\nsudo scanimage -L fails to find the device\nsudo sane-find-scanner fails to find the device\nsudo scanimage -d sane-canon_dr -T says this is an invalid device\n\nA: Canoscan 9000 Mark II is using sane-pixma backend, so editing /etc/sane.d/canon-dr.conf is wrong.\nSee SANE Supported Scanners database for more info.\nWARNING: Following is NOT The Right Way™ to do things!\nI got mine to work by updating my udev, libsane and libusb from Debian's Testing version.

The image is base64 encoded.  If you can see this picture of a happy bus then that part is working.\nIf you cannot, then something is very wrong with your browser or the version you have is very old (or you have images turned off or something hard to tell or guess).\nSo mostly, I want to figure out if you see the last line in your html output, and if so does your browser properly display base64 encoded images.  One of these two should not be the case.\n", "Q: Ctrl+Space mapping broken in Vim after upgrade to 14.04 I recently upgraded to Trusty via reformatting my system partition and keeping my home partition intact. Everything has gone smoothly except my mapping of Ctrl-Space to Escape in Vim no longer works. The line in my vimrc is inoremap <C-Space> <Esc> and when I run ':imap' inside vim I see the mapping is there. But nothing happens when I try it.\nI'm especially baffled because all other Control assisted combinations see to work perfectly fine and I never had any issue with mapping Space before the upgrade. Any ideas?\n\nA: I presume it is the same issue as described in lp bug#1278511, in which case running ibus-setup and disabling Control+Space should do the trick.\n", "Q: Creating a Live USB with minimal files at root? I want to have an EDC flash drive with the option to boot Ubuntu from it, but the default set up makes for a really messy root directory with all of the important files. Any possible way I can reduce it to one or two folders and still boot easily?\nThanks!\n\nA: Well, no. That is Ubuntu disc structure and it cannot be modified. \nThe main image with all the contents resides in casper/filesystem.squashfs.\nThe boot folder contains grub bootloader so can't be removed.\nThe dists and pool folders contains some packages that ubuntu installs. \nEFI is also important for newer computers.\n", "Q: Removing OpenVPN and all modifications When starting up my server takes a long time.

I've set up a MAAS controller by following this documentation:\nhttp://maas.ubuntu.com/docs1.4/cluster-configuration.html\nHowever, when I got to the DHCP configurations I was a little puzzled.  The controller I created is at 172.16.142.61.  It looks like that's the address for the \"IP\" text field.  Going down the rest of the list I'm unsure of though.  Should I just put in the subnet/broadcast/router (is that the gateway?) that the MAAS server resides in or am I suppost to just list the static address of the MAAS server and then define my own \"virtual\" subnet in the fields below?\n\nA: The DHCP configuration is for the MAAS server to be managing it's own subnet; this is how you would usually have a MAAS region/controller set up. The fields are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*IP: This is the IP address of your MAAS controller; you are correct\nin assuming that it would be 172.16.142.61 if you installed it at\nthis address.\n\n*Subnet Mask: This is the subnet mask of the MAAS region. Normally, you would put up a MAAS controller in its own subnet; the mask for that subnet goes here.\n\n*Broadcast IP: This is the broadcast IP address of the subnet; it's usually something along the lines of an address ending in 255\n\n*Router IP: This is the IP address of the router for your subnet as part of your MAAS region - i.e. your gateway. Type in the IP address for your connection to the larger internet here.\n\n*IP Range Low: this is the start address for where a MAAS controller will begin handing out IP addresses to other clients. If you start the low range at, say, 100, then you can guarantee that machines on the network that request addresses will get an address which is at least 100.\n\n*IP Range High: This is the end address for the MAAS controller's DHCP services - like the low value, this is instead the maximum IP address that will be allocated out to other machines by the DHCP.\n\n", "Q: Can't open image files with Picasa in Ubuntu 12.04 I have installed Picasa using Wine but I am not able to open any image using it as Picasa does not appear in the list of applications which can be changed to default program for opening image files.\n\nA: Open Picasa and go to\nTools > Options > File type\nCheck the boxes next to all the file types and click OK\n\n\nA: Create a desktop entry for Picasa like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion = 1.0\nIcon =\"path to your favorite icon\"             \nType = Application\nExec = \"Path to your wine program e.g. wine \"c:\\picasa.exe\"\n\nInformation on how to set the values for .desktop file can be found here.\nand save it as /usr/share/applications/picasa.desktop\nthen you should be able to set it as your default image viewer. \n", "Q: Some PDF documents are messy when printing I have following problem, I've got a PDF document that I need to be printed, but unfortunately, when entering printing preview all characters get messy and they don't resemble original document's content at all. The thing is, this is the only document with such issue I've encountered so far. On Windows, Adobe Reader renders and prints the document just fine. \nWhile I've got this particular document printing problem solved, I'd like to not have to encounter this ever again. I couldn't find anything about this issue.\nHere's the document in question, click here.\n\nA: Good question. It could be a font issue - the Windows font (Arial) in your document is not installed in Ubuntu by default. Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type (or use Ctrl+Shift+V to paste):\nsudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n\nThen press enter. This should install a few common Windows fonts.\n\nA: I have faced similar problem in case of printing a pdf document. I found that even without printing if I save it as a new .pdf document, I get a document with many misplaced words, unknown symbols and bad spaces. However, I found a solution to this by just saving the original document in .ps format and then converting it using ps2pdf in terminal. The converted output file is exactly same as the original document now and is printable too. \n", "Q: AMD Catalyst Control Center Displaying Unknown Discrete Graphics Card I have a HP Pavilion g6 - 2301AX laptop.

I followed the BinaryDriverHowTo/AMD, but I can see only 7640.\n\nA: I am having the same graphics card and using samsung laptop. You have to purge the current install drivers. Visit amd support center and by manually providing input select like among desktop and notebook etc, select among the graphics card series like 7xxxm and 8xxxm. Then download it and extract it. Then go to the file saying .run. then go to its properties and under permission check \"allow executing file as program\". save it. then double click and follow the instruction to install it as you would installing it on windows. Finish it. Reboot. Ta-da. you are done. Now there is one problem. While switching between graphics you have to reboot your pc. 7640 g will give u power saving and go easy on battery backup, while for gaming you can use the 7670m. But 7670M drains the battery lot faster.\n", "Q: How to run Ubuntu, within Windows, from a USB drive? Is is possible to run Ubuntu from a USB pen drive, while simultaneously working and running the main OS (Windows) on the computer? I assume this is like a virtual desktop held on the USB, and displaying in a window on the computer.\nI would like to be able to explore/ navigate to it, or minimize and maximize in and out of the Ubuntu [session], while the Windows [session] is still in operation.\nEdit/ update:\nI attempted to install Virtual Box and a portable V-box onto my 16gb USB without luck. It wanted to only install/ run and operate from my computer not the USB.\nIs there a way to keep all programs on the USB, launch from the USB and never install anything to the host computer? (Virtual-box or the like)\nIn conjunction with running Ubuntu from that USB like a hard drive and be capable of saving settings, programs and documents?\n(Not a live or boot-able USB)\n\nA: You cannot run 2 different operating systems at the same time on the same computer, however an alternative would be to install a virtual machine program like VirtualBox or VMware Player on Windows and then run Ubuntu in a virtual machine.\nVirtual machine softwares are basically a program that pretends to be a computer, allowing you to run multiple operating systems at the same time. Keep in mind that virtual machines require a decent computer, and they don't get great performance so it depends what you plan to do as to whether it will be viable. In order to access your files you will need to enable a shared folder between the virtual machine guest and the Windows host, because the virtual machine has it's own virtual hard drive.\nJust install a virtual machine program, create a new virtual machine, and then install Ubuntu like normal within the virtual machine. If you need help figuring out how to do that check out this posting for VirtualBox [ How to install Ubuntu on VirtualBox? ] or this posting for VMware Player [ Can I run ubuntu with VMware? ].\nVirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\nVMware Player: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0\n\nA: Try VirtualBox. It's virtualisation software. Download it from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\n\nA: I'm not allowed to comment, but the easiest way to do it might be to use virtual box as the guy mentioned.\nTaking it one step further you might be able to get the portable version of virtual box and put that on the usb as well.\nThere is a program called Linux live (lili) creator which will actually set it up for you. Not only will the usb drive be bootable but it bundles a copy of virtual box on the pen. Although truth be told, I've never seen it working. I may have made one really small attempt to see what the auto run did a long time ago.\n\nA: Another vote for virtualbox, its really so easy. The vdi file, which is the actual operating system with all your files inside, can easily be kept on a usb stick (but they tend to be big files, so you would need a stick with a lot of space).\nWhen you set up virtualbox, it will ask you where the vdi file is, and then it will make some configuration files which normally would be stored inside windows. Then, when you open up the virtualbox launcher, it will look for that vdi file, and warn you if it can't be found. Just plug in the usb, then it will see the vdi file and be able to start up.\n\nA: I ran across this article and it appears this should suffice my quest.\nhttp://www.maketecheasier.com/install-virtualbox-in-usb/\n", "Q: bash - wrong answer by word count command I am trying to get the word count of a string using the wc command. But it gives me a different answer. It increases the number of words by 1.\nThis is the code:\necho Enter a string:\nread str\nlen=`echo $str | wc -c`\necho you have entered: $str\necho and the word count: $len\n\nThe output is like this:\nEnter a string:\nrobin\nyou have entered: robin\nand word count: 6\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Please help me solve this. I will be very grateful. Thank you.\n\nA: Assuming you mean character count not word count (which would be 1), the issue is that echo adds a newline character. You can either use\nlen=`echo -n $str | wc -c`\n\n(the -n switch suppresses the newline) or - better - just use the bash # variable length operator \nlen=${#str}\n\n\nA: From man wc:\n-c, --bytes\n    print the byte counts\n\n-w, --words\n    print the word counts\n\nSo, you should use wc -w instead of wc -c.\n", "Q: mount grub partition I'm pretty new to Linux. I am trying to make a dedicated partition for bootloader called grub2. I am following this tutorial and I'm stuck at step 5. \n\nExit GParted and mount the new Grub partition. 'Places → Grub.' A new\n  icon called Grub should show up on your desktop and its corresponding\n  window should open.\n\nit should be mounted under /media/partitionname I think.\nI'm trying this with a 14.04 Ubuntu live CD\n\nA: This tutorial is really a bad idea.  You do not want to have a normally unmounted grub partition where you have to manually write your own grub config file that will not be automatically updated when new kernels are installed, and will break when grub is upgraded.  If you want a separate /boot partition, you need to keep it mounted in /boot, it needs to be significantly larger ( at least 100 mb, preferably 200 ), and it should use ext4 instead of the antiquated ext2 filesystem.  You will need to edit your /etc/fstab to mount it in /boot ( you can look up the uuid with sudo blkid and follow the template of the existing entries in fstab ), and then mount it with sudo mount /boot.  After that you want to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc to reinstall grub to the mbr of your boot drive, and then run sudo update-grub to generate the config file.\nYou also do all of this from the installed system, not the live cd.\n", "Q: Can't open magnet links or APT links with Chromium Chromium browser opens a new window instead of handling magnet links or APT links.

I honestly don't expect them to ever get it up to PHP 5.5 (what 14.04 installs by default).\nSave from going back to 12.04 LTS and starting completely over, is there a way I can downgrade the PHP version installed to 5.4? I saw some threads talking about this for going from 5.4 to 5.3, so I'm hoping its doable.\nThe simpler you can help me to do this, if possible, the better. I know my way around, but by no means consider myself an expert. Thanks!\nEDIT: For clarity.

This should let you save the file changes. *only for files with 777 permission\n2) \nThis has more to do with proper security and linux \"users\"\nYou could add the line force user = <user, whoever you are>\nThis goes under the \"[share2]\"\nLinux is designed to authenticate you and limit permissions, the quick and dirty way of getting Ubuntu files from a windows machine is typically going around the security. It's the the perfect way, but its often the home/home office way.\n", "Q: how to run cpufreqd in ubuntu 14.04?

The indicator is one of those plugins (and the easiest one).\n\ncpufreqd is started automatically after installing. For it to work you need either APM, a recent ACPI or PMU. And the modules cpufreq_powersave, cpufreq_userspace, and cpufreq_ondemand (you need to load these for cpufreq to work). It has a configuration file that explains all the different settings in /etc/ and has samples. What is best for you is up to you to decide ;)\n\nAn alternative would be TLP.\nJust a warning: the tools for management should already be in the kernel (and working).

Hence you may not getting security update.\n \nFor more info visit : Ubuntu-announce.\nSo, Recommanded to install fresh Ubuntu 14.04 which will support until April-2019 (can be downloaded from http://www.ubuntu.com/download)\n", "Q: Ubuntu wont boot (only blank screen) after upgrading to 14.04 Upgrade Manager suggested an upgrade of my Ubuntu to 14.04. All seemed to go well, but after restart, Ubuntu fails to boot. Only a black screen appears, and I don't know what to do. I can't even access grub (the shift key is ignored, only the word \"GRUB\" appears on screen, ctrl+alt+f1 doesn't work either). I need to preserve data on the HDD. \n\nA: I had the same problem, too, so I downloaded and burned the Ubuntu 14.04 on DVD and booted from it. I selected \"install Ubuntu\" and the option which installs Ubuntu without formatting or losing data. It does ask for a default user - just use the same user than before, so it will be mapped to the original home directory.\nI had to re-install all my applications, but as the configuration files were not erased, a lot of things reverted to as they were before.\nThe other users were manually and I had to do some \"chown\" to ensure that they matched the old one, as the owner of the home directory user1 was user2, etc...\nI am sure that there is other method, but as you mentioned, I wanted to get back on my feet very fast.  It took me 30 minutes to get a working computer.  I am sure that I have missed some applications but when I will need them I will re-install them.\n", "Q: Every Video in Fast forward motion 14.04 No Sound just fast playing video it doesn't matter which ever player or browser i use.\nWhile checking in System Monitor pulseaudio in very high priority.\nI tried to uninstall and re-install pulse audio but nothing changes..\nStopped all the plugins in browser nothing happended.\n\none Observation was that while playing video in youtube when i ended the pulseaudio process using system monitor the video became normal but no audio....\n\n\nA: I get this issue when selecting an alternative sound output. If I have the analogue output selected all is fine. Do you have more than 1 output option in sound settings? If you do try changing it.\n\n", "Q: Remove ifupdown(eth0) connection While I was installing Ubuntu 14.04 I had some issues with graphic card drivers so I needed to install drivers from root, I created adsl connection using pppoeconf.\nNow when I boot up my PC I have two connections, my regular connection which I use and ifupdown(eth0) which was created using pppoeconf.\nHow can I delete eth0 connection so it doesn't bothers me anymore?\n\nA: Open your file manager and go to /etc/network/. Once there, you have to edit the file interfaces like this:\n  sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces \n\nor \n  gksu mousepad /etc/network/interfaces\n\nand delete all entries in there except for auto lo / iface lo inet loopback. \nThe following lines\n   auto lo\n   iface lo inet loopback\n\nhave to be the only entries present in /etc/network/interfaces.\nNext you should edit a second file located in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf. Use this code in a terminal window:\n   sudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nor \n   gksu mousepad /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nLook for this entry [ifupdown] and edit the entry to look like this:\n   [ifupdown]\n   managed=false\n\nReboot and reconfigure if necessary your network using the network applet from system tray.\n\nA: Open terminal and enable super user mode.\nnano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nThe contents of the file will be like this:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono\ndns=dnsmasq  \n[ifupdown]  \nmanaged=true\n\nPlease change the plugins section to:\nplugins=keyfile,ofono\n\nRestart the network manager:\nservice network-manager restart\n\nIt worked for me, I hope it will work or you too.\n", "Q: How to install luidia ebeam software I have downloaded from Luidia, the ebeam interactive software for linux. The filename is \"ebeamscrapbook_linux_ubuntu_1_0_0.tgz. I am running ubuntu 12.04. How can i install it?\n\nA: The file extension .tgz is used for a certain archive type.

There are no system sounds as far as I can tell and there is no option for setting this in settings.

Yes, Youtube sounds and Songs, movies etc are working fine. Its just sound indication/system sounds which were played as  a feedback from system during events. \nE.x:Login sound.\n2nd Edit: I was able to get Log-in sound working by following this.\nHowever, nothing else has worked to get other sounds working which are mentioned in there.\n3rd Edit:\nProblem;\nXXXXX:~$ xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/EnableEventSounds\nfalse\nXXXXX:~$ xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/EnableInputFeedbackSounds\nfalse\n\nFound solution, looks like this was set to false so I had to change it to True using following commands, not sure why it was on false though.\nxfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/EnableEventSounds -s True\nxfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/EnableInputFeedbackSounds -s True\n\n\nA: This drove me crazy.  Make sure Pulse Audio Volume Control is installed. \nTo install open a terminal (Ctrl+T) and type sudo apt-get install pavucontrol \nThis took me forever to find but worked like a charm.\n\nA: Search for Pulse Audio Volume Control in XFCE menu, Go to playback section, you will find the system sounds section. It must have been muted\n\n\nA: Search for PulseAudio in XFCE menu. Go to Output Devices section. You will find the mute audio button. It might have been muted.\n\n", "Q: Upgrade from 13.04 to 14.04 I have Kubuntu 13.04 (unsupported release), and want to upgrade it to 14.04.\nWhen I'm trying to run do-release-upgrade I got this error:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):   File\n  \"/usr/bin/do-release-upgrade\", line 123, in \n      \"%(url)s\\n\") % { 'url' : url }) ValueError: unsupported format character '?'

Solve this by clearing desktop configs in your /home/userxxx and re-login)\n\n3. reboot (just in case)\n\n4. start the software updater and run the 14.04 LTS upgrade \n\n5. Your're done. \n   May take quite a bit of time (2 dist upgrades) and is not guaranteed to \n   work in every situation, but if not, re-installing is still an option.\n\nA: I recommend a new/clean install of 14.04 LTS.\n\nYou might be able to upgrade to 13.10 by having that on other media (eg. USB stick).\nBut there is no support (past Jan-2014) for 13.04, for any issue that might occur.\n", "Q: How to delete Windows and make Ubuntu use whole space, without reinstall? I have both Ubuntu and Windows installed. My partition setup is pretty simple:\n\nAfter latest updates to Kerbal Space Program, Ubuntu and Steam, last reason to keep Windows installed perished.\nHow can I get rid of Windows partitions and give all that space to Ubuntu, without breaking my bootloader? I'm pretty sure that simply deleting partition with boot flag wouldn't be the wisest course of action.\nNote that there are 2 similar questions and I have seen them:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to get rid of Windows\n\n*getting rid of windows\nSadly, both are about fresh Ubuntu installations, and neither is about Ubuntu already installed on physical partition.\n\nA: First thing to do is to make a disk image of your entire SSD using something like Macrium Reflect Free Edition (Windows) or Clonezilla (Linux).  If you use Macrium, you also need to make a bootable rescue CD/USB.  Similarly, Clonezilla should be run from a live-CD/USB.  You now have a backup of your current system and a means of recovering the disk to this state if something goes pear shaped when you try to change your partitions/boot system.\nsda1 is almost certainly your factory recovery system for reloading Windows in the event of a catastrophe.  You probably want to leave this in place just in case you ever want to go backwards.  It's only 100 MB.\nNow you can use a live-CD/USB with Gparted and remove sda2, your Windows partition.  Once this has completed, you could expand the extended partition into the (now) unallocated space if this what you wish.\nAt this point, I would suggest re-installing the GRUB2 bootloader using the following commands in a Terminal window:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\nIf there is any problem booting, try an alternative method of recovering GRUB (e.g. http://linuxnorth.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/re-installing-grub2/)\nIf all else fails, remember that rescue disk/disk image...?\n\nA: If you just want to keep it simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete any windows paritions\n\n*Login using a live cd having gparted installed in it\n\n*Extend your root partition.\n\n\nIf you want to make it a bit more complex, ie, if you free space is not continuous or right next to your root partition (which in not your case),\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete any windows paritions, format is as linux native ones with Gparted.\n\n*Edit your fstab to mount the newly created paritions at some useful mount points, like /tmp, /var or /home. If you are doing this, I recommend copying everything as is in your original /home to this new location before editing fstab & restarting.\n\n\nYou should now be able to use the new space.\nWant to get even more geeky? Migrate to LVM. Its is worth the effort.\nBTW you dont have a swap parition. Its good to have one.\n", "Q: How can I make all applications use Nemo's file selection dialog instead of Nautilus? I switched to nemo a long time ago, because I think it's superior to nautilus in many ways. One small thing bothers me however:\nWhenever I want to open a document in gedit (or evince, but I'm sure there are other programs as well) not the nemo file-selection window appears but the nautilus one. \nI did of course replace nemo with nautilus as suggested in a lot of other posts:\n gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\n\nand\n xdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search\n\nand also did \n ln -s /usr/bin/nemo /usr/local/bin/nautilus\n\nin order to completely replace nautilus, but this doesn't help. Which program/executable is triggered when hitting open (Ctrl+o) in gedit/evince?\n\nA: It's not a nemo vs nautilus issue. It's a GTK+2 vs GTK+3 issue. Apps written for GTK+2 will use the familiar-looking Humanity-themed file selection dialog, while apps written for GTK+3 will use the alien, hollow-looking default theme for GTK+3.\nUnfortunately, the only way to get a consistent UX is to use all GTK+2 apps, or switch to a Qt-based DE like LXQT or KDE.\nSorry.\n\nA: I think you have to run next commands:\nxdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\ngsettings set org.nemo.desktop show-desktop-icons true\n\nAnd check Nemo is default:\nxdg-mime query default inode/directory\n\nAlso here exists a guide to change\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DefaultFileManager\n", "Q: Remote desktop doesn't works after upgrade from 13.10 to 14.04 I worked for many years with ubuntu nas server. \nNow last week I updated my server from 13:10 to 14:04. \nThat in itself went well except Remote Desktop. \nThe server is in the attic and I control it from my work PC thru VNC. \nAfter the update, this no longer works and VNC gives the following message: No supported authentication methods!\nI have vnc server installed as a separate application, but I also get the same error message. \nWhen I look at my settings, everything is still the same. \nDoes anyone know how I can \"fix\" it without reinstall ubuntu?\nThanks for the help. \nGrt JayDee\n\nA: Seems that vino was changed to require encryption by default, but only supports old encryption methods that are not commonly available.\nThis is a workaround till they fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf-editor: sudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\n*Start it.\n\n*Navigate to: org > gnome > desktop > remote-access\n\n*Disable \"require-encryption\"\n\n\n(from this thread on discourse).\nOther way to fix it is disable vino and only use x11vnc server.\nx11vnc will work as long as no other desktop screening or screen sharing program is active.\n", "Q: No graphical login after purging Cinnamon I wanted to try Cinnamon and installed it: sudo apt-get install cinnamon\nBut it didn't work well, because all the gnome stuff was missing on my Kubuntu.

I wanted to remap some hotkeys I am used to from my previous system but I can't get it to work properly with xbindkeys.\nxbindkeys recognizes the combination but somehow the command does not trigger.\nIf I use the command\nxdotool key braceleft\n\nIt outputs me the correct { sign in the console. However if I use the same command in xbindkeys nothing happens.

I know Alt_R (AltGr) is the proper way but on german keyboards it is somehow hard to type the braceleft with the AltGr (Alt_R) key so I HAVE to use Alt_L+Control+7 instead (like I was used to in my previous system). I somehow got it to work properly in 12.04, but I can't get it to work in 14.04.\nAny suggestions? I tried several commands.

Maybe I will find a solution for this too.\n\nA: The problem with xdotool is while real keys are pressed Xorg repeatedly sends keypress events (look at xev output). To overcome this you need to temporarily turn off repeat feature, then generate KeyRelease event on key that were down.\nInstead of\n\"sleep 0.2 && xdotool type --delay 15 '{'\"\n  Control+Alt + 7\n\ntry the following:\n\"xset r off; xdotool keyup --window 0 7 type --clearmodifiers --window 0 '{'; xset r on\"\n  Control+Alt + 7\n\n\nA: As documented in similar questions (Why do these xte commands work in terminal, but not when bound with xbindkeys?), you can ask xbindkeys to trigger events on release (on key up):\n\"xdotool key braceleft\"\n   Release+Control+Alt + 7\n\nIn this way, there is no conflict between the keys used for the shortcut and those sent.\n\nA: As I tried another several things, i noticed that xdotool seems to trigger too soon.

After some research, it appeared not only do I need to cancel out the Control, but also the g key (which is what needed the sleep 0.1 delay to begin with). If I cancel out both of these keys by using keyup within xdotool as well as the --clearmodifiers switch, it works. This is my new command, in my .xbindkeys.rc file:\n\"xdotool keyup g key --clearmodifiers XF86AudioPlay\"\nControl + g\n\n\nA: Not sure why it doesn't work with xbindkeys, I'm guessing you need to specify the window to write to.

Based on the output of your cvt command, you need to run these two:\nxrandr --newmode \"1280x1024_60.00\"  109.00  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA-0 1280x1024_60.00\n\nThat should make the new mode available in the Displays dropdown menu. If that works, see here for how to make it permanent:\nWhy don't my lightdm.conf edits affect my desktop screen resolution?\n\nIf that doesn't work, my guess is that the driver you are using can't support the resolution. In this case, we will have to make sure you are using the nvidia driver and to do that, you will need to install inxi, then edit your question and add the output of inxi -G. Once we have seen the output of that we'll be able to better understand what's going on. \n", "Q: Set apt-get to use gzip bz2, gzip or uncompressed file?

I don't know why I am having no luck, lrzip in particular should be effective according to random reviews I have read and the official docs (files larger than 100mb, the larger the better) - see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lrzip\nWhy can't I compress my files?\n\nA: This is a nice example of the pigeonhole principle. \nSince the file is already (lossy) compressed, there's little to no reduction to be had anywhere, which means that you're already at zero net gain. As the others mentioned, the compressed format itself has a certain, usually negligible loss in in its own meta-data. All of this comes together means that there is probably no pigeonhole left in the set of equal or smaller files and thus your compressed data falls into the set of larger files. \n\nA: If you want to compress these files you will have to reduce the quality.\nWithout knowing how long and what format and content type these files are its hard to tell if these files have room to be shrunk without much visible quality loss.\nBluRays with 1080p video tends to be upwards of 25GB so its not unlikely you're already at an optimal quality-to-size ratio for H.264.\nYou can try using ffmpeg or avconv to convert files.\nYou could start with ffmpeg -i input_file.mp4 -preset slower -crf 20 -c:a copy output_file.mp4\nThe anconv command will work similarly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Increase the -crf value to decrease file size and quality, I don't recommend any higher than 25.\n\n*You can change the preset to slow or medium to increase speed, but your file size will suffer compared to slower or even veryslow (if you're very patient!).\n\n*More settings can be found here: http://mewiki.project357.com/wiki/X264_Settings\n\n*I recommend staying away from most as the presets provide sane defaults, with -tune being the exception.\n\n*Try a denoiser if you content is film ( -vf hqdn3d ) you can improve visual quality compared to using a high -crf value.\n\n*Scale down your content -vf scale=-1:720 for 720p and -vf scale=-1:480 for 480p to improve encoding speed and maintain quality.\n\nA: As @pram said above in the comment, mp4 videos are already compressed, and other video formats probably also use compression to some extent. Therefore, trying to compress them won't result in little (if any) reduction in size (this also applies, at least in part, to pictures and music). In this case, it looks like the metadata (for the compressed file itself) might be causing the increase. The only compression format that might (and that's a strong might) result in some reduction is xz.\nOn another note, if you want to reduce the size of those videos, look instead into re-encoding the videos using something like Handbrake.\n\nA: Really, the fact that the files are already compressed is not the crucial problem. It's this: compression in general can only work if the data has some kind of redundancy in it. That's practically always the case for uncompressed files – however, it's not necessarily obvious what the redundancy is. General-purpose compression algorithms mostly target the kind of thing obvious in text files: many words turn up not just once but plenty of times in identical form, perhaps phrases of words can be combined, etc. etc.. The algorithms are quite good in generalising this to anything from ASCII-encoded phone number lists over chinese poetry to binary machine code, but they can't possibly work for any kind of data. In particular, media files are conceptually analogue data, in a noisy digital representation. That means, there's not really any of the kind of textfile-reduncancy at all: some motives might be recurring, but always with a slightly different configuration of sensor noise. That's why all compressed image/AV formats use some cleverly chosen transformation as their first encoding step, normally based on DCT or wavelets. These transformations roughly speaking move the picture-portions and noise-portions into different locations, so they can well be seperated and with lossy compression you retain only the information you think is most \"important\", which does not include the noise, while the \"good information\" has lots of redundancy. (That's not really how it works, but sort of.)\nIf general-purpose compressors used these transformations, the effect would be the opposite: most digital information would actually be misclassified as some kind of noise, because it lacks the \"smooth\" structure you find in analogue signals. And after lossy video compression obviously neither analogue smoothness or digital recurrence can be found anymore (if it were, the codecs would use another bzip-stage or something themselves!)\n\nA: The reason you're having no luck is that mp4 is already compressed, you can't compress it further. All you are doing is adding the compression format's header information to the file. \nSince the files are already compressed and you can't compress them further, this results in an increase in file size since all you're doing is keeping the same information and adding a few more bytes of header info. \n", "Q: Simplest MTA mail setup for a desktop to receive (ana)cron emails Ubuntu (12.04 LTS) doesn't seem to install any sort of mailer by default.\nEverybody seems to recommend installing Postfix.

Is there a special place that the ones that change are stored, or are they simply inaccessible?\n\nA: I don't think this is a default wallpaper, or at least I don't have it.\nYou can get the location of your current wallpaper by executing gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri as an user who has set this wallpaper.\nI've never heard of \"dynamic wallpapers\" in Ubuntu so I hope this method still works for you.\n\nA: Indeed - this is part of an automatic picture changer consisting of three JPG's gradually cycling from one JPG to another over certain time-periods:\n\n\n*\n\n*07:00 for one hour fixed at morning.jpg \n\n*08:00 for 5 hours - gradually transitioning from morning.jpg to bright-day.jpg,\n\n*13:00 for 5 hours - fixed at bright-day.jpg\n\n*19:00 for 6 hours - gradually transitioning from bright-day.jpg to good-night.jpg\n\n*00:00 for 5 hours - fixed at good-night.jpg\n\n*05:00 for 2 hours - gradually transitioning from good-night.jpg to morning.jpg\n\n\nThis is driven by an XML file located in the Adwaita theme folder /usr/share/themes/Adwaita/backgrounds/adwaita-timed.xml\nHave a look - you can use this XML as a template for your own wallpaper changer\n\n\nA: The wallpaper always comes accompanied of a theme or in a package, in the case of these is the gnome-themes-standard-data package which has all the wallpapers:\n[...]\n/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/backgrounds/bright-day.jpg\n/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/backgrounds/good-night.jpg\n/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/backgrounds/morning.jpg\n[...]\n\nThe complete list of all files in the packages can be found in the package list.

The node.js server itself creates the post to the external service when it successfully starts.\nBut when I create the Droplet, it restores the machine to the original state (the node.js server is already up and running). So since the node.js server doesn't start, the post to the external service never happens.\nIs there an alternative upstart event I can use that's not \"startup\"? One that would fire when a VM somes online?\nI'm new to upstart, so I'm still trying to get my bearings with this tool, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Is there some kind of resume script that is executed when the droplet is restored? If so, add the command initctl emit --no-wait droplet-resumed to the script, and then you will have the event droplet-resumed to signal when the thing is restored.\n", "Q: ffmpeg since update to 14.04 Ever since I updated to 14.04 (from 13.10), each time I launch the Software Updater, it shows on the list of updates \"ffmpeg derived postprocessing library\".

When I then click on Install Now, it says about the ffmpeg update: 'Package operation failed. The installation or removal of a software package failed.' I can't say I've a clue what to do with this update. \nHow do I stop it being listed on the list of updates each time I fire the Software Updater? \nMore importantly, do I need to have that update? Have to say, the computer as such seems to be working all right. Can't say I've noticed anything...so far any way :)\nWould be grateful for any answers to any of the Qs above.\n\nA: \nHow do I stop it being listed on the list of updates each time I fire the Software Updater? \n\nsudo apt-mark hold <package-name>\n\nIf the computer seems to be working properly then you are free to hold that package.\n\nA: 14.04 does not offer anything from FFmpeg. Originally, the actual ffmpeg and libraries from FFmpeg were provided, but then Ubuntu switched to a fork that offered a counterfeit \"ffmpeg\". The fork eventually dropped their false \"ffmpeg\", and Ubuntu did the same at 14.04.\nIf you want the real ffmpeg, then either get a static build from the FFmpeg Download page, or follow a guide to compile ffmpeg.\n\nA: Open a terminal and type the following:\nsudo apt-mark hold libpostproc52\n\nNow your software updates will proceed smoothly, even though the library is still shown in update manager, just in an un-ticked state.\nSolutions that totally remove the package or remove it from the software updater package list completely are welcome.\n", "Q: Motion Webserver not working So, I've installed Motion on ubuntu 12.10, and it seems to be working, for the most part.

Do not delete the most recent old kernel as a rule of thumb and be safe.\nNormally you have the error while upgrading, and that means you can have a failed upgrade linging; I would advise a \nsudo apt-get install -f\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade \n\nafter the cleanup.\n", "Q: Unable to access BIOS I switched to Ubuntu a while back and over time entropy and inexperience lead to a bunch of redundant applications, a very messy directory tree and general slowness.

I know this question has popped up many times but I want to make it very clear that none of the posts helped me a bit.\nmy Problem:\nI am unable to get my custom wallpaper stored at /home/sudeepto/Pictures on the Ubuntu login screen . The screen shows me purple background and upon giving login credentials the graphics gets really scrambled for a while and then I can use my system just fine.\nI guess since most of the articles are not Ubuntu 14.04 based, I am having such problems.\nThings that I tried:\nI followed this post on askbuntu . I tried both the suggestions but no luck.\nI don't know how to take screenshot of unity-greeter, otherwise I would have given links to my login screen as well.\nPlease tell me what should I do next to solve this problem which I never faced in previous versions of Ubuntu.\n\nA: To change the background of the login screen (based on this answer):\nsudo -i\nxhost +SI:localuser:lightdm\nsu lightdm -s /bin/bash\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter draw-user-backgrounds 'false'\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background 'path-to-image'\nexit\n\nThis will only change the background of the login screen. If you also want to change the background of your lock screen, you should also execute the following commands as each user you want to change the background for:\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter draw-user-backgrounds 'false'\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background 'path-to-image'\n\nI can confirm this is working on 14.04 LTS.\n\nBy setting draw-user-backgrounds to false you can set a custom background.\nObviously you should replace path-to-image by an absolute path to the image you want to use. Make sure the lightdm user has read permissions for this file.\n\nOptional tweaks you might like\nYou can also change the background color which you'll see in a flash (default purple) before your background is loaded. To do this, execute the following command after the other gsettings commands (this will change the color to black):\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background-color '#000000'\n\nAnd you can disable the dots on the login screen by executing the following:\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter draw-grid 'false'\n\nAnd also remove the greeter sound\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter play-ready-sound 'false'\n\n\nA: In current Ubuntu 14.04 (October 2014), there is no need to hack gsettings manually. If the wallpaper file is available to others (read permissions), the greeter automagically displays everyone's background as you select the login name.\nMy wallpaper lives inside the Dropbox folder which has the permissions drwx------ and thus the greeter can't access it. Copying it to the pictures folder which has permissions drwxr-xr-x and using it from that folder solves the issue. Probably linking via ln -s works as well (although I didn't try).\nYou can check the permissions of everything in a folder using the -l option for ls.\n", "Q: How to update drivers for a XPS 8700, and why do I hear a sound on the PC like a ventilator?

Here it is:\nhttps://github.com/pranaysharma/linux_scrypts\n", "Q: Value of if command outcomes I'm pretty new to Ubuntu linux, let's say all of linux because I installed it a few days ago. I'm sorry for my mistakes in my use of English, because I live in the Netherlands.\nWell I tried to do some programming, writing a script, but I encountered a problem which I haven't been able to solve yet. Well I was writing a script, and I want this script to automatically install a few things for me. Well I was doing and tried to make as less nests as I could, and I finished my script, but I thought. Why wouldn't I try to put a few lines in it which check if the programs are correctly installed. So I wondered how I could do it and I came up with the following:\nBecause I'm new to programming I wanted it to be so advanced as I could by myself. So I decided to try to work with shell functions. These functions check if the correct file is there, and the outcome of these functions has to be a value which I can use later. Here an example:\nfunction isitthere\n{\nif [ -f <thefile> ]; then\ntrue\nelse\nfalse\nfi\n}\n\nif [ $(isitthere) = \"true\" ]; then\necho \"Your program is properly installed\"\nelse\necho \"Your program isn't properly installed.\nfi\n\nIn this example are true and false my values, and as you see, I try to re-use them in my second command. I know this can be done much more easily, but I want to know if it is possible, and if it is possible how. Because in one part of my script doing it like this makes it much easier. Is there any way you can give a value to your if command and use that value later in your next if command?\nThanks.\n\nA: Keep it simple; this works alright (tested in Ubuntu 12.04):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction isitthere\n{\n    [ -f TheFile ]\n}\n\nif isitthere; then\n    echo \"Your program is properly installed.\"\nelse\n    echo \"Your program isn't properly installed.\"\nfi\n\n\nA: Welcome Dutch fellow!\nYou could use something like this:\nresult=isitthere\n\nHere you assign the return value of your function isitthere to the variable result. This variable now contains, in this case, true or false. You can always retrieve the value of result using $result.\nHowever, if you want to catch the output (STDOUT) of your function (for example if you use echo inside your function) you should use:\nresult=$(isitthere)\n\n\nA: There are many ways of doing this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the inbuilt features of the shell. Commands (and functions) have exit values. Usually, an exit value of 0 means the command was successful and a value > 0  means it failed. This is checked by the shell when you use the || or && operators. So, to run a command only if the previous one was successful, you would use &&, ro run it unless the previous was successful, you use ||. For example:\n$ foo\nThe last command was succesful\necho 'foo' && echo \"The last command was succesful\"\n\nIf you use a command that does not exist, it will obviously fail:\n $ echooo 'foo' && echo \"The last command was succesful\"\n echooo: command not found\n\nNote that the second message is not printed. If you use || instead:\n$ echooo 'foo' || echo \"The last command failed\"\nechooo: command not found\nThe last command failed\n\nYou can combine these into your shell function:\nfunction isitthere\n{\n    [ -f thefile ]\n}\n\nisitthere && echo \"The file exists\" || echo \"the file does not exist\"\n\nThe test operator (also known as [ ]) returns an exit value of 0 on success and 1 on failure. This means that your function can be simplified to the above.\n\n*Use the return command. This is actually exactly the same as the example above, I am simply stating it more explicitly. It also allows you to return more complex values for different fail cases.\nfunction isitthere\n{\n    if [ -f <thefile> ]; then\n        return 0\n    else\n        return 1\n    fi\n}\n\nif [ $(isitthere) ]; then\n    echo \"Your program is properly installed\"\nelse\n    echo \"Your program isn't properly installed.\nfi\n\nI used the same syntax as you to illustrate, but this could be shortened to\nisitthere && echo \"Your program is properly installed\" || echo \"Your program isn't properly installed.\"\n\n\n*Have your function print something to standard output and then act accordingly.\nfunction isitthere\n{\n    [ -f thefile ] && echo yes || echo no\n}\n\nif [ $(isitthere) = \"yes\" ];\nthen\n    echo \"Your program is properly installed\"\nelse\n    echo \"Your program isn't properly installed.\"\nfi\n\nIn this example, we're using the standard output of the function and not its return value. To capture the output of a command (or function) you need to use command substitution. This allows you to run a command and save the output as a variable. For example\n$ foo=$(echo bar)\n$ echo $foo\nbar\n\nSo, the test if [ $(isitthere) = \"yes\" ] checks whether the output of the functin was yes and acts accordingly.\n\nNote that I have used both [ -f thefile ] && echo yes || echo no and the more complex \nif [ -f <thefile> ]; then\n    return 0\nelse\n    return 1\nfi\n\nThe two are basically equivalent, I used both only to illustrate that. You can use whichever you prefer.\n", "Q: Low resolution on Lubuntu 14.04 (Sis) The resolution of my lubuntu is 640x480 and I can not change it.

I'm a newbie in Linux and for that reason I need some help. I tried to follow some steps that I saw in some topics but nothing happens.\n\nA: Yes, it's not the best graphics card ever seen, but it can do 1024x768 in Lubuntu 14.04 all the same, if you force the machine to use the vesa driver.\nCreate a file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/use-vesa.conf with the following content:\nSection \"Device\"\n  Identifier \"Configured Video Device\"\n  Driver \"vesa\"\nEndSection\n\nAnd that's all. Reboot, and you should have your resolution.\nThe file can be created with any text editor - if you're not comfortable with the terminal, you'd probably want to use something graphical like leafpad. However, you'd need to be root to have write access to the place where the file is needed.\nSo, open up a terminal (CTRL + Alt + t) and type \"sudo leafpad\". You need to enter your password there. I presume you're doing this as the default user so sudo should work and the editor window will open.\nThen you can copy & paste the required text into the file and save it to the given location (/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/). The name \"use-vesa.conf\" is arbitrary, you could also call it \"whatever.conf\", as long as the .conf bit is in the filename, and the file is saved in the right place, it will work.\nPlease check whether it works for you.\n\nA: Create and use the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file shown in my question here: Cannot get resolution of 1280x800 on my \"SiS M760GX\" video card\nThe above solution allows resolutions of 1280x768, 1024x768, 800x600, or 640x480, thereby producing a better result than simply using the xorg.conf file below:\nSection \"Device\"\n  Identifier \"Configured Video Device\"\n  Driver \"vesa\"\nEndSection\n\n", "Q: Cannot install Ubuntu on UEFI device from scratch I've replaced my HDD by a SDD on my Zenbook Prime and am trying to install only Ubuntu 14.04.

Check out my newer answer\nThis is my previous solution - It is unadvisable to use, it is not unlockable if you lose your phone; you have to restart to unlock it\nI eventually came up with a solution - don't lock it in the first place. This may sound odd - bear with.\nInstead of locking it, I disabled the Mouse and Keyboard, hid all desktop icons and then switched to the desktop. You could possibly hide more stuff (like the launcher) but I have that hidden anyway.\nThis command requires a bit of setup.\nInstall : xdotool - sudo apt-get install xdotool\nEnter: xinput --list and note down your mouse and keyboard ids.\nI would suggest editing these commands in gedit\nThis one acts as the locker.\nxinput set-prop <Keyboard ID> 'Device Enabled' 0 && xinput set-prop <Mouse ID> 'Device Enabled' 0 && gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false && wmctrl -k on\nThis acts as the unlock.\nxinput set-prop <Keyboard ID> 'Device Enabled' 1 && xinput set-prop <Mouse ID> 'Device Enabled' 1 && gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true && wmctrl -k off\nChange the  and  to their respective numbers, in both commands.\nIn order this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disables / Enables the Keyboard\n\n*Disables / Enables the Mouse\n\n*Hides / Shows all your desktop icons\n\n*Toggles showing your desktop.\n\n\nOne important thing to bear in mind - this can't be undone without your bluetooth device. If for some reason it fails, you have to restart. Because of that, it might be advisable to leave the keyboard enabled, and set up the unlock command to a chosen shortcut.\n\nA: So, I figured the \"best\" way to do this (apocryphal, since we're still storing a password and faking typing it into a thing) would be to, as I commented above, encrypt the password to the entry USB key.  It's a little messy of a script, so I'll explain what's going on.\nThe devices for the current user are enumerated by looking through /etc/pamusb.conf with xpath; each one is then mated with its UUID using xpath, and the UUID mapped to a device using blkid.\nYou have the choice to lock, unlock show device, or set up your key.  When you run setup, it'll create ~/.ssh/pamusb_rsa if it doesn't exist.  You'll then be asked to pick a device (or not, if there's only one), and to enter your password.  Your PW will be stored, encrypted, in {device}/.pamusb/.auth.\nWhen you run unlock, the devices are enumerated again,  and checked one by one for a /.pamusb/.auth file.  When one's spotted, decryption will be attempted and, if successful, will be used to type your password into whatever happens to be accepting text at the moment.

There is a way to use the normal lock screen! Yay!\nI don't know how secure it is (storing your password in plaintext), but I think it is the best possible.\nThis is the lock command: gnome-screensaver -d\nThere are 2 unlock commands:\nNo1:\nThis is the 1st unlock command: \ngnome-screensaver -d && xdotool type mypassword12 && xdotool key Return\nThe click is to wake it up (it should click inside the login box, because of the mouse move), and show the nice new lock screen, instead of the \"sleeping\" black screen.\nThen it types mypassword123! with an enter, to submit it, into the text box.\nImportant. For some reason - probably because of what xdotool is actually meant to be used for (keyboard shortcuts) - you can't enter double letters. To get around this, split it into 2 commands at each double letter (as above). Also, numbers have to have their own, separate command from letters (also above). Finally, modifiers (such as shift) need a separate one, as does the Return key.\n\nNo2:\nThis is the second one. It is a bit better and less hackish, but requires a lot of setting up.\nFirst install actionaz:\nsudo apt-get install actionaz\nOpen a new script, and drag in the correct items to your flow. (you can download the completed one here. If you chose to download this, open it, double click on Write text - Password here, and enter your password).\n\n\n*\n\n*Pause: enter 3 seconds.\n\n*Click: copy and paste 165:555 into the Position box. (Depending on screen side, this may be different. Make sure it is clicking in the password box, otherwise it doesn't work).\n\n*Write text: enter your password in the box\n\n*Key: Click in the box and press Return\n\n\nSave it in your home folder as unlock.ascr (or any name - I just didn't want to advertise that it had my password in it)\nSet up your proximity command to be:\nxdotool mousemove 0 0 && actionaz unlock.ascr -ex\nThe mouse move wakes it up, and the options tell it to execute the script and then exit at the end.\n\nIf you lose your device, you can always just type your password, so it is reversible.\n", "Q: How do I backup system to a different partition on the same drive?

I removed my 4.2 version of VirtualBox and installed the downloaded 4.3 version using software centre.  The software installation didn't seem to end normally.  The icon for the software centre changed to a ? at the end of the installation.  I thought it wise to reboot.  When I rebooted my unity was gone.  I just had a blank wallpaper desktop.  I had to reinstall unity.  My default terminal was also gone.  I had to reinstall that.  This is not so much a question as a warning to others to exercise caution when installing VirtualBox 4.3 on Ubuntu 13.10.  I have done some searching on the web and I can't find others who have had this specific problem but some people mention the same problem after a \"software install\" but they don't say which software.  \nMy question is this.

I also tried installing 13.10 when 10.10 was already installed, but the process freezes. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: It sounds like you installed 10.10 via wubi, which is no longer supported.  To properly remove it from Windows you will simply have to get administrative privileges.  If you want to install 14.04 ( 13.10 is about to reach end of life, so don't bother ), then you can boot from the cd and install it along side windows, which will shrink the windows partition to make room for Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to backup drivers? I just wanted to know if there any very easy way to backup and restore drivers just like  system restore in Windows system? I don't  want to revert back to original factory settings state. Just wanted to roll back to old drivers if anything goes wrong while installing new one or updating. (I am really missing system restore feature of Windows)\n\nA: You are showing that you are new ;-) Regarding your concerns:\n\n\n*\n\n*All you need to worry about backing up is your private data. You can copy those files over to a media to create a backup or setup our backup tool deja-dup to create automatic backups.\n\n*If you use server software on your machine (like apache or mysql) you also might consider backing up the config files for those.\n\n\nFor all other software, we have the official repositories. So why waste a DVD, USB stick or hard disc space to keep a copy that is available online or even on your installation media.\nIn Ubuntu, we have the additional drivers tab that holds all the drivers you ever need to take care of. Why do you need a backup if they are on the servers from Canonical? I can not think of a better place for them to be saved for me.\n\nI don't want to revert back to original factory settings state\n\nWhy is that a worry to you? The additional drivers tab holds both the original and proprietary driver and maybe a 3rd one. It might also hold a wireless driver. And that is it. It is always there for you if you want to switch graphics cards.\n1 thing of advice for you: forget about how you do things in Windows. Linux does things in another way. That does not mean either way is wrong (just that the 2 operating systems came from different perspectives (Windows single user; Linux multi-user) and have had other thoughts about how to do things.\nI hope I took away a lot (if not all) of your concerns. Join us in chat (20+ rep required ;) ) if you have questions. Happy Ubunting.\n\nA: \nJust wanted to roll back to old drivers if anything goes wrong while installing new one or updating\n\nPlease, don't! Linux has the peculiarity that all drivers are built-in the kernel, loaded if needed, and such modules (is how Linux calls drivers) are built specifically for each version of the kernel, and won't work on others. These modules are included in all installations of Ubuntu by default. If your system worked just fine, is highly likely it will work fine in a new installation. The only preoccupation may be that there's a regression in the modules, but these are weird and easily solvable.\n\nif there any very easy way to backup and restore drivers just like system restore in Windows system?\n\nNo, not at all. The reasons are explained above.\n", "Q: What is a swap partition and why is it important? While I was installing Ubuntu 13.10, it asked me to make a swap partition. I made it ~5.6GB, as I didn't know what it was or anything.\n\nA: Simply said it is an additional space provided for the operating system to increase it's operating memory. It allows for running more software at once or to operate with larger data.\nSomething alike also exists in windows, only they implement it as file on a new file system, which is likely done for efficiency.\n", "Q: Is there a key combination similiar to windows to restart computer?

The only catch is that you have to have the keyboard plugged into the computer (doesn't work remotely).\n\nA: Press the power button on your keyboard. The system will allow you to select the icon that looks like a power button to turn off the computer. There's a circular arrow that will let you reboot it without powering it down, coming the closest to Windows CTRL-ALT-DELETE.\ndash-plus-java's helpful suggestion is good in emergencies when this won't work, but it doesn't allow the various daemon's in your system to terminate normally. (That's not normally a disaster, though).\n\nA: @dash-plus-java answered correctly, but not all SysRq keys are enabled by default. Out of the REISUB only U and B are enabled. If you want to enable all SysRqs, do:\necho 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq\n\nThis will enable all sysrqs. If you want just some of them, change the value you echo above, as mentioned in the kernel Docs, https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysrq.txt\nNow you can press and hold <Alt> <Sys Rq>, and sequentially press R, E, I, S, U and B. Each of them have specific meaning:\n\n\n*\n\n*r - Puts the keyboard into raw mode, taking control of it away from the X server.\n\n*e - Sends the terminate signal to all processes, asking them to end gracefully.\n\n*i - Sends the kill signal to all processes, forcing them to end immediately.\n\n*s - Flushes data from your cache to disk.\n\n*u - Remounts all file systems read-only.\n\n*b - Reboots your computer.\n\n\nMore SysRqs:\n\n\n*\n\n*n - Resets the nice level (priority) of all high and realtime priority processes.\n\n*f - Calls oom_kill, which will kill a memory-hogging process.\n\n*k - k – Kills all programs on the current virtual console, including X\n\n*o - Shuts off the computer.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to restore everything I had before I corrupt the upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04? When I was upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04, I mistakenly terminated the installation window and lost everything and I corrupted the system.  So, is there a way to restored the Programs (including the settings), files, ect...?\n\nA: Well as you can see the installation (upgrade) remove every file so they are lost. The program I used (to get my files backs after an accidentally Hard drive clean) photorec .\nIt's a program that is run from the terminal to retrieve files from a partition.\nTo install it:\n\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nTo execute it:\n\nsudo photorec \n\nFollow the next steps that appear you and you could retirieve your files\nNOTE: It will include all the files like the ones that were at the other directories in /\nAlso it may not work because it has the 14.04 there but you could give it a try\n", "Q: How do I separate my boot partition from my storage partition? I have a dual-boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 system. The windows partition is on my larger 1 TB HDD, but my Ubuntu was installed onto my significantly smaller 32 GB SSD. Without completely reinstalling the whole system, how can I create a partition on my 1 TB drive so that it becomes my default installation and storage location? I want to make it so the SSD essentially only has the boot files, and the system knows to look to the secondary partition for any files, programs, etc.\nI have previously attempted to do this on older dual-boot systems, but I could not make the secondary drive the default install location. Moreover, Ubuntu never auto-mounted the extended partition, which sometimes made programs act up. (This may have been a bug from the older version, so I am not too concerned about this.) However, if I have essential programs written and executing from the secondary partition, it is critical that partition automount at start-up.\nI was suggested elsewhere to create a symlink to the secondary partition, but I don't know enough about that to know if it will actually do what I want, or if it is the best way to do it. This may just be an ignorance of file structures, but any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: When you are installing Ubuntu, set up the partitions manually.\nCreate a ext4 partition on the SSD with the mount point set to /boot . Then create a ext4 partition on the larger drive for / . I also recommend a partition for linux-swap that is the size of your RAM.\nI think the boot-loader will need to be on the SSD (set on the same screen at the bottom).\nThat will set it up so the boot files are on the SSD and the rest is on the other drive.\nAnother recommendation would be to put / on the SSD, and put /home on the larger drive. / usually uses about 8GB on any system I've set up. The larger stuff is always in /home.\n\nA: It's much better to do this at installation time as suggested by dash-plus-java.\nHere is an approach to adding it later that may work for you, but you can mess up your system if you make a mistake:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up everything. Also copy the existing /home/yourname\ndirectory somewhere handy as mounting another partition on top of\n/home/yourname will hide whatever is now in /home/yourname while the\nmount persists.\n\n*Create your new /home/yourname partition on your drive and format it. I suggest you format it as an EXT3 partition.\n\n*Open a terminal by pressing CTRL-ALT-T\n\n*Install gksu with the command sudo apt-get install gksu. You'll\nhave to enter your password.\n\n*Enter the command sudo blkid device where device is something\nlike /dev/sdb1 for the first partition of the second ('b') drive.\nThis command will give you the partitions label and UUID. You will\nwant to remember the UUID.\n\n*Start an editor with gksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*Make the editor window wide enough so that you can see each line of\nthe file on a separate line on the screen.\n\n*Add a line like the following to the end of that file. Substitute UUID\nwith the UUID you got above. Make sure you don't change the existing\nlines in the file or you will be in trouble. If your new home\npartition isn't formatted as 'ext3' you will have to substitute that\nwith the real format.\n> UUID=*UUID*     /home/*yourname*      ext3      rw      0      0\n\nSave the updated /etc/fstab after checking it thoroughly. Don't save\nit if you aren't sure. Mind the spaces in the line you added. There\nis a space between 'UUID' and '/home', between 'yourname' and\n'ext3', between that and 'rw', and before and after each '0'\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Copy anything you need from what you saved from your current\n/home/yourname to the new /home/yourname (your other partition).\nThe system uses the contents of /etc/fstab at system boot time, doing a mount for each line of the file.\n", "Q: Why do I get an error when using apt-get?

I want to upgrade to iOS7 on my iPhone 4.  Is there any way I can do that without installing a virtual machine? I currently run Ubuntu 14.04. Thanks a lot!\n\nA: I don't understand. You don't need Ubuntu nor is a computer of any kind involved in the process of upgrading to iOS 7. However, if you want to install iTunes in Ubuntu anyway, I would recommend using a program called Wine to do that (http://winehq.org). It is available for Ubuntu and is a program that allows you to use and install Windows programs in Linux. Also, Wine is not an emulator, meaning that Windows programs run at full speed because Wine is an implementation of the Windows kernel. When you download Wine, I highly recommend installing Wine 1.6 instead of the Wine 1.7 beta.

I have not used a Linux distro before, but want to give Ubuntu a try.  I have some knowledge about WUBI.  Do I need WUBI to install Ubuntu 14.04 with Windows System 7?\n\nA: From my own experience Wubi installer for Windows works best with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and some of the other operating systems which are part of the Ubuntu family like Xubuntu 12.04 LTS or Lubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nIf you're planning to test Ubuntu first in a dual-boot configuration with Windows, then wubi installer is a good way to start but you will be limited to only 30GB of space when installing Ubuntu. Other than that, Ubuntu will boot fast, and you will be able to use Ubuntu in a very similar manner like when installing Ubuntu on a separate Linux partition.\nIf you want to play it safe, and don't have plans for the moment to change your partition table adding the necessary Linux partitions for installing Ubuntu, wubi installer is the right choice. Once you get used with this new OS, you can decide later on to install Ubuntu 14.04 inside a real Linux partition. \nIt is recommended to download and install the same architecture for Ubuntu like you used it when installing Windows. If you have Win7 64bit, you should download and install Ubuntu desktop 64bit iso image for the wubi installer. If Win7 is a 32bit version, choose Ubuntu desktop 32bit iso image from the list of available iso images for Ubuntu 12.04. \nTo be able to install Ubuntu 12.04 easier using wubi.exe, you should first download both wubi installer and your preferred Ubuntu iso image, place both files in a temporary folder on your desktop, and start wubi installer from inside that temporary folder. After reboot, allow the installer to finish installing Ubuntu, and only after a second reboot you can choose Ubuntu from the boot menu list and hopefully boot into your newly installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nRead this Wubi Guide, it may prove useful for you.\n\nA: If you just want to try out Ubuntu instead of installing it for good, I recommend virtualization. Go to http://www.virtualbox.org and download Oracle VM VirtualBox in Windows. Then, you can install Ubuntu in a virtual machine, meaning that the entire operating system runs in a window as a program, and uses a \"virtual\" hard drive that is actually an ordinary file.

There is a quite good karaoke plugin from the Steve Harris' LADSPA Plugins which will remove central vocals from a stereo recording, and which can also be used with Audacity.\nThese plugins will be installed with the package swh-plugins . The amount of voice removal and consecutive mono conversion is given as control parameter in dB.\nTo apply the effect we need to know the pulseaudio name of our default audio sink with \npacmd list-sinks\n\nThe default sink name is marked with an asterix like in the example below:\n* index: 1\n      name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo>\n\nWe can then apply the karako filter with the following command\npactl load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=Karaoke master=<name> plugin=karaoke_1409 label=karaoke control=-30\n\nReplace <name> with the name of your audio device (e.g. alsa_output.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo).\nNote down the module number given as output from above command in case we want to remove it again (pactl unload-module <nmber>). All modules are removed and default are reset with pulseaudio -k.\nThe control parameter gives a voice removal of -30 dB here, higher values (i.e. less negative like -10) for more vocals (but better music), lower values  (i.e. more negative like -60) for even less vocals but also more original music removal. Positive values are possible but they will lead to heavy distortions.\nChoose this newly created audio output sink as output in your sound setting before you start playback of your music player.\n\nNote that not all music recordings are suitable for this karaoke plugin, the more central the vocal stay the better. Mono recordings will not work.\n\nA: The \"Remove Vocals\" option in most programs uses a clever trick.  Usually when recording a song, the vocals are centered, meaning they are present at an equal volume in both the left and right channels.  On the other hand, usually instruments are off-center, meaning they are louder in either the left or the right channel.  Therefore, you can try to remove the vocals by \"subtracting\" the two channels.  Since the vocals are the same in both, they disappear completely.  Since the instruments are louder in one than the other, they are quieter, but still present.\nThis technique obviously does not work on mono files that do not have separate left and right tracks.  Moreover, it more or less generates a mono output.  Even for songs that were recorded with centered vocals and off-center instruments, it normally cannot remove the vocals completely.\nWhile it is possible Virtual DJ used some secret or proprietary algorithm to achieve better performance, I find that unlikely, especially given the content of their FAQ on the subject.  In fact, they even make a recommendation for an alternative program, which is incidentally the same one I was going to recommend regardless.\nTry out Audacity.  You can find it in the Ubuntu Repositories.  To remove vocals, follow the steps on this page.\n\nA: A software that can do this is called sox \nIt has an option for karaoke:\n\noops\nOut Of Phase Stereo effect.  Mixes  stereo  to  twin-mono  where each  mono  channel contains the difference between the left and right stereo channels.  This is sometimes known as the ‘karaoke’ effect as it often has the effect of removing most or all of the vocals from a recording.\n\nSo from command line this ...\nsox song.wav music.wav oops\n\nwould create music with vocals removed.\nCan't get any easier?\n\nThere are more programs. audacity  can do it too. It is graphical.\nHere is a how to.

The minimum CD does not include this, as you'd probably expect. Simply run:\nsudo apt-get install speech-dispatcher\nIf you're still having trouble also run:\nsudo apt-get install alsa-base alsa-utils alsa-tools\nsudo apt-get install libasound2 libasound2-plugins\nsudo alsa force-reload\n", "Q: Kubuntu 14.04 change login animation/splash screen In kubuntu 14.04 settings there is the option for changing the login screen background, but there is no more the option to custimise the animation/splash screen after the login, while the desktop environment loads. \nIs there any way to change/customise it like in Kubuntu 12.04?\nThanks\n\nA: I sort it out myself... the splash settings window can be opened launching the \"ksplash\" application typing ALT+F2 and then \"ksplash\", or searching \"ksplash\" in the search box of the application menu. \n", "Q: GRUB booting only Ubuntu but not Windows 8 I have Windows 8 installed in C drive (by default from Lenovo) & Ubuntu separately installed in another partition.\nWhen I start my computer it leads straight to the GRUB menu. There I can see options to load Ubuntu and Windows 8. \nWhen I select Ubuntu it works fine, but when I select Windows 8 option, then it leads straight back to the GRUB menu.\nHence I am unable to boot into Windows 8 via the GRUB menu (the only way I can boot into Windows 8 is by using the one touch recovery button).\n\nA: Boot Ubuntu. Try opening a terminal by holding down CTRL and ALT and tapping T and then issue the command\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis should find your windows 8 installation again. If this doesn't work it's possible you've overwritten your Windows 8 boot sector which you would need to repair with windows 8 media and then reinstall grub (making sure you don't overwrite the windows boot sector again) so you can boot ubuntu.\n", "Q: WiFi issue: /var/log/syslog and kern.log are too huge after I installed Ubuntu 14.04 Freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04 last week and my WiFi was not working.

How to deactivate/remove the problematic WiFi drivers?\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: It sounds like your wireless card was disabled at your laptop's hardware switch.  There is often a function key that can re-enable the wireless card (Fn+F2 for me), or a physical switch somewhere on your device.\nIf you have switched out your wireless hardware since installing Ubuntu, it could also be a hardware address issue that can be resolved by modifying udev rules.  It sounds more like the hardware switch is turned off, though.\n", "Q: How to access root folder?

I installed from a DVD and it installed fine except it was incredibly slow.\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed Compiz to remove window effects but it was still horribly slow.\n\n*I installed mesa-utils to test if 3D acceleration was working, which it wasn't.\n\n*I tried going to System -> Software+updates -> additional drivers, but that says no drivers are available.\n\n*I tried going to NVIDIA's site for drivers and tried installing them from the terminal but I got an error complaining about rmmod's path.\n\n*I tried sudo apt-get install nvidia-311 and got a similar error.\n\n\nIts now booting into a black screen with no user feedback.

It's a know problem on 12.10.  It doesn't seem to be mentioned in any of the later release notes.\n\nA: Answering my own question after some work:\nThe problem is SORT OF fixed in 14.10 (and possibly 13.xx).  I was able to install, but it will only use an 800X600 display.  I guess it's time to update my old hardware, sigh!\n\nA: According to the manpages for the sis package.\n\nSUPPORTED HARDWARE\nThe sis driver supports PCI, AGP and PCIe  video  cards  based  on  the following chipsets:\n\nSiS5597/5598  SiS530/620  SiS6326/AGP/DVD  SiS300/305 SiS540 SiS630/730\nSiS315/E/H/PRO   SiS550/551/552   SiS650/651/661/741   SiS330   (Xabre)\nSiS760/761 XGI Volari V3/V5/V8 XGI Volari Z7\n\n\nBesides bugs the 651 is supported and has been since at least 2008. Though you might need to manually configure it.\n\nIt is hardware from Microsoft... if possible replacing it or adding another video card  might be a better option.\n", "Q: Unable to mount hard-disk at startup I am trying to mount a separate hard-disk automatically before startup, and for some reason fstab is failing me.

I've come across a couple of questions around similar issue but none that are specific to my configuration. I'd really appreciate if someone can suggest a solution for this.\n\nA: These are some references to get you started:\nExtend Desktop to Monitor over LAN\nExtend Linux Desktop to another X Windows Display:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/71794/extend-linux-desktop-to-another-x-windows-display\nDMX HOmepage:\nhttp://dmx.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: Virtual Monitor Over VNC\nxdmx didn't worked for me, however I was able to get it working using x11vnc by means of using my own code derived from the VNC Virtual Display Linker python code. I had a couple of issues with this code but I managed to get it working as shown below.\nSimplified Intructions:\nPlease be aware of the notes and considerations at the end of this answer.\n\n*\n\n*Definitions: The \"server\" will be the computer which screen you want to extend, the \"client\" will be the computer (or tablet, any device able to deploy a VNC client) that you want to use as a screen.\n\n*Required Software: On the server install x11vnc and gtf, on the client install a vnc client.\n\n*You need to know client's screen size (we'll call them: CLIENT_WIDTH, CLIENT_HEIGHT) and the servers' screen size (we'll call them: SERVER_WIDTH, SERVER_HEIGHT).\n\n*In the server, run in a terminal gtf CLIENT_WIDTH CLIENT_HEIGHT 60 (replace the CLIENT_WIDTH and CLIENT_HEIGHT with the corresponding values). As an example for gtf CLIENT_WIDTH CLIENT_HEIGHT 60 is\n\n# 1384x768 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 47.70 kHz; pclk: 86.62 MHz\nModeline \"1384x768_60.00\"  86.62  1384 1456 1600 1816  768 769 772 795  -HSync +Vsync\n\n\n\n*From the previous result copy what is in front of Modeline, (in this case \"1384x768_60.00\"  86.62  1384 1456 1600 1816  768 769 772 795  -HSync +Vsync) and use that as a parameter to xrandr --newmode command. For example, in this case, we'll have to run in the server xrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"  85.86  1368 1440 1584 1800  768 769 772 795  -HSync +Vsync\n\n*In 5 we've created a newmode in xrandr, now we need to add it to the virtual screen, as follows xrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 \"1368x768_60.00\" (please remember to use your own newly created mode name, which is the value including quotes in 5).\n\n*Run x11vnc -usepw -nocursorshape -nocursorpos -noxinerama -solid -repeat -forever -clip CLIENT_WIDTHxCLIENT_HEIGHT+SERVER_WIDTH+0. As an example: x11vnc -usepw -nocursorshape -nocursorpos -noxinerama -solid -repeat -forever -clip 1368x768+1920+0. This will create a VNC server in port 5900 you can connect to.\n\n*Lastly, connect to the server from you other computer (or any VNC client, recommended krdc for linux machines). You should be able to enjoy your extended screen now.\n\nNotes and considerations:\n\n*\n\n*In step 8, with krdc, it is recommended to use the \"Medium Quality\" option, even if you are on cable: both the \"Low\" and \"High\" quality options produce errors.\n\n*I tried this over a WiFi network and it works properly, however on cable it's smoother.\n\n*I had problems when starting the VNC server in step 7, the screen started to flicker and I couldn't see what I was doing on the screen. To fix this, I connected via the VNC server (the extended screen already works at this point), opened the Displays tool (the one that comes with the system where you can see the displays that are connected) and Unify Outputs then Break Unified Outputs\n(an example of this option in Kubuntu is shown below). Then everything worked.\n\n\n", "Q: Clementine won't play .wma, with \"Your GStreamer installation is missing a plugin\" error Here's a screenshot: \n\nIt displays messages like: \"Clementine stopped.\" or displays songs that are not playing, and indicator icon is disappearing and reappearing. Does this happens only to me, or is it common bug in 14.04. I clean installed 14.04, and in 13.10 clementine worked fine. Any ideas? I installed ubuntu-restricted-extras.\nEdit1: I restarted computer and theme changed:\n\n\nEdit2: I just figured out that clementine won't play .wma files, and that's when errors start to emerge.\nEdit3: VLC and the default ubuntu player play .wma without problems. Please help!\n\nA: 14.04 and later\nI've checked the clementine 1.2.x dependencies and I can confirm it requires the gstreamer 0.10 plugins and since wma support is provided by the ffmpeg plugin you need to set up the following PPA to enable WMA support for 14.04 and later:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/gstffmpeg-keep\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg\n\n\nA: I was getting this error on 14.04 LTS when trying to stream any internet source. This is what resolved the error for me:\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-libav\n\n\nA: By the way, in my Ubuntu 14.04 (upgraded from 13.10) it seems that there is no apt-add-repository\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\nNow yes, you can install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg as #1 said:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with clementine and ubuntu 16.04 , although everything was working good before but suddenly m4a songs stopped to work . \nI open a single file using the default ubuntu video application it prompts me to install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad-faad \nso may this command helps you out there\n$ sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad-faad\n", "Q: /etc/X11/xorg.conf keeps getting renamed? I am using /etc/X11/xorg.conf to configure xf86-input-mtrack.\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf keeps getting renamed after every 4 or so reboots. For example, it was renamed to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.0426201 recently. Why does this happen?\n\nA: There are (at least) two packages that might do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/bin/gpu-manager in ubuntu-drivers-common can replace /etc/X11/xorg.conf if it doesn't find the right contents in it (LP #1310489). If the generated settings doesn't conflict with your own edits, it's easiest to just leave them in.\n\n*The nvidia-prime package does this on upgrade. If you have automatic package updates and reboot seldom, it could explain your observations.\nI don't know the reason, but I regard it as a bug - opened LP #1345585.\nBoth rename the old xorg.conf to xorg.conf.MMDDYYYY.\n", "Q: Finding and deleting all files that begin with . within a directory I'm trying to find and delete all files that begin with . within a directory, and I know that I could do this via the command terminal but I'm VERY new to Ubuntu and don't quite know my way around commands yet. Any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: Hidden files don't have to be binary files.\nYou can use the following command to do this:\nfind /path/to/start/ -maxdepth 1 -name \".*\" -type f -delete\n\nThis will search for files in /path/to/start/ starting with a dot (-name \".*\", * means everything) without searching in sub directories (-maxdepth 1, change 1 to search deeper) only files (-type f) and will remove all the results (-delete).\nIt's not always a good idea to delete these files! Please be sure that you know what you're doing before executing this. Some files are hidden for a reason.\n\nA: You can also do this using shell globs and a for loop:\nfor file in .[^.]*; do rm \"$file\"; done\n\nThe for file in GLOB; do ... done will expand GLOB to all file names that match it, iterate through these files, sequentially saving each as $file and then run the commands between the do and done on them.\nThe glob .[^.]* will match all files beginning with a . and followed by a non-dot character ([^.]). The latter is needed to avoid matching . and ../. \nSo, for example:\n$ ls -1A\n.dot and spaces\n.dotfile1\ninternal.dot\nnodot\n$ for file in .[^.]*; do rm -v \"$file\"; done\nremoved ‘.dot and spaces’\nremoved ‘.dotfile1’\n$ ls -1A\ninternal.dot\nnodot\n\nIf you want to run this for a directory other than the one you are currently in, just add the path to the glob. For example:\nfor file in /home/terdon/foobar/.[^.]*; do rm \"$file\"; done\n\nOf course, the loop itself is not needed as @gniourf_gniourf pointed out in the comments, and you can simply delete all the files with \nrm .[^.]*\n\n", "Q: Error when trying to create desktop icons New user to Ubuntu 14.04, and having trouble trying to create desktop icons.

I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 and tried to type in Korean by adding the Korean language by using the language support and input method switcher. However, I am still unable to type in Korean. I have also installed ibus hangul, but I am unable to see any ibus settings or anything related to ibus in any settings. \nI have tried switching the language from the top right setting from EN to Ko and I still type in English. \nSo how can I type in Korean, did I miss a step or something?\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: After installing Ubuntu, go to language support. Choose Korean to add language.Then, restart the system and go to \"text entry\" and choose \"korean (hangul)\", not just \"korean\".\n\nA: Ensure that the package ibus-hangul is installed. You can do it simply with the program synaptics, or you can do \ndpkg -l | grep ibus-hangul\n\nIf you don't have it, well... install it (again, with synaptics or with the command line:\nsudo apt-get install ibus-hangul\n\nThen, in Unity (or Gnome), you should find the program \"ibus preferences\". \nOn the top, there is a scrolling menu: \"Select an input method\". Click on it, select Korean, then click on the plus sign to add it. That should be it.\n\nA: After installing Korean Language Support, you have to restart Ubuntu in order for Korean(Hangul) [with the little goryeo taeguk flag] to show up in the text entry list. \nIf you go to inputs before you restart, you'll see a Korean option, but it's not hangul. I'm not sure what it does, as it just types in English either way. You have to choose the one with the goryeo taeguk icon [red, blue, and yellow circular logo]\n\nA: When you're using hangul you might need to type shift+space to switch to korean characters.\nTo fix this annoying default, look at the ibus preferences in the menu where you add languages to ibus (\"Input Method\" tab).\nSelect \"Korean - Hangul\". (after adding \"Korean - Hangul\" if you haven't already)\nTo the right there is a \"Preferences\" button.

I just found that there is a apt command that you can use directly:\n $sudo apt \n apt 1.0.1ubuntu2 for amd64 compiled on Apr 10 2014 13:03:39\n Usage: apt [options] command\n\n CLI for apt.\n Basic commands: \n  list - list packages based on package names\n  search - search in package descriptions\n  show - show package details\n  update - update list of available packages\n  install - install packages\n  remove  - remove packages\n  upgrade - upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages\n  full-upgrade - upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages\n  edit-sources - edit the source information file\n\nWith similar syntax to apt-get. And it offers some coloring in the CLI interface. So I want to know if there are some major difference between apt and apt-* commands? Why do people seem to post commands as apt-get install and apt-cache search when they don' t need the additional options apt-* commands provide, while apt is shorter with all the similar functionality with additional coloring, and in my opinion, better output format? Is it only habit?\nI see in the manual pages that apt is for end-users while other low-level commands are for scripts. So why is everyone posting those low-level commands instead of the more user-friendly high level command?\n\nA: I think this apt official blog can explain everything.\n\nAPT 1.0 was released on the 1. April 2014! The first APT version was announced on the 1. April exactly 16 years ago.\nThe big news for this version is that we included a new “apt” binary that combines the most commonly used commands from apt-get and apt-cache. The commands are the same as their apt-get/apt-cache counterparts but with slightly different configuration options.\n\n\nA: The reason not many people recommend the simpler apt tool is because it's new. It wasn't in Ubuntu until the 14.04 release a week ago. \nFor most interactive uses it is equivalent but easier to use and looks nicer. \n", "Q: Upgraded my 32 bit machine with 64 bit live image of Ubuntu 14.04 by accident!

All the networking and the card reader stopped working. Is there any way to fix it since, I want internet back on my laptop.\n\nA: For the networking, have a look at /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf. I'm guessing that you also have a Broadcom network card. edit the blacklist.conf file as root and remove any lines starting with bcm. If there is a file in the same directory starting with blacklist-bc*, move it somewhere else for the time being. Upun rebooting, yor drivers will no longer be blacklisted. \nPlease note that this is based on the assumption that your cards are Broadcom chipset based. Although I've not heard of this problem occurring with Atheros chipsets, a similar series of changes using \"ath\" rather than \"bcm\" should fix the problem.\n", "Q: Keyboard troubles I recently got a great new keyboard, the Perixx PX-1100, but I'm having trouble with it. If you look up and study said keyboard, you will see that it has backlighting. There is a knob to adjust the brightness, and a button that changes the light color or turns it off. When you plug it in or the computer starts with the keyboard already plugged in, The light is blue. The color order is \"Blue>Red>Purple>Off\". I've found out that pressing this button operates different things. Depending on which color the keyboard is already on, pressing this button does the equivalent of \"Button 1\", \"Button 2\", \"Button 3\", or \"Button 4\". \n\n\n*\n\n*If the backlight is blue and you press the button (changing to red), it performs \"Button 3\".  \n\n*If it's on red and you press the button (changing to purple), it performs \"Button 2\".   \n\n*If the the backlight is purple and you press the button (turning off the light), it performs \"Button 4\".  \n\n*If the backlight is off and you press the button (changing to blue), it performs \"Button 1\".  \n\n\nIt also seems the hold down the button as long as it's on the color. This causes issues where if I'm in a browser, I can't click on certain things. I understand that usually, \"Button 1\" is left click, \"Button 2\" is right click, and \"Button 3\" is clicking your scroll wheel.

I have an Acer ao756-2617 with Ubuntu 14.04, elementary os luna, bodhi linux, and zorin os 8. most of these if not all are Ubuntu or Debian related (not sure bout Bodhi). anyway, every time i try to use my brightness controls for the screen, they don't work. when i use them, all i get is the animation on the upper right corner that its working, but it doesn't actually do anything. so i did some research. I found that I could manually change the brightness using one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo intel_backlight <% no. of brightness>\n\n*echo <no. from 0 - 976> | sudo tee - /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\nApparently, the file controlling the brightness for the screen is the one described on the command above.

I'm reading instruction to move files into .config folder tree specifically  ~/.config/geany/filedefs/, but can't find it in Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Since .config is a hidden folder it will not appear in your File Manager by default.

Since Ubuntu one is no longer it appears that Sync between computers no longer works.  Is there a new method to do this?  I'd like to sync the apps from one machine to another.\n\nA: I'm adding this as a new answer now that I have a better understanding of what the full requirements are. \n\n\n*\n\n*Install SpiderOak, Copy, DropBox or some other file syncing software on all machines. \n\n*Set the software up on the source computer to sync a directory that here we'll refer to as '~/SyncDir'\n\n*Schedule a cron job to regularly (daily?) run the following: sudo dpkg --get-selections | sed \"s/.*deinstall//\" | sed \"s/install$//g\" > ~/SyncDir/packageList\n\n*On the target computer, use the following script to watch for changes in the package list as it gets synced:\nwhile true; do\n change=$(inotifywait -e close_write,moved_to,create .)\n change=${change#./ * }\n if [ \"$change\" = \"packageList\" ]; then sudo aptitude update && cat ~/SyncDir/packageList | xargs sudo aptitude install -y; fi\ndone\n\nThat should do it. You could theoretically run both parts on all machines so that they would see each others changes as well but there might be some tweaks required to stop it from continually updating. you also may need to move the \"sudo aptitude update && cat pkglist | xargs sudo aptitude install -y\" section into a shell script rather that running it directly inside the 'watch' script.\n\nA: I am currently using Btsyc which is the BitTorrent sync client. It is not open source but works great.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tuxpoldo/btsync\nsudo sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install btsync\n\nCould also use dropbox\n\nA: There are lots of good options for the same sort of service as Ubuntu One. My favourite is SpiderOak (https://spideroak.com/download/referral/ddae53eebe43dfc9f0ac35eb1345bb51) as it does security \"right\" with full client side encryption. They also have an advanced set of configuration options and it works quite well as a backup service.\nAnother good one that supports Linux is Copy (https://copy.com?r=wjbtyg). It does not have the advanced encryption that SpiderOak has, but has a more generaous referral program. \nDropBox (https://db.tt/YdA2Xss) also supports Linux, but I hesitate to recommend it because of privacy concerns with a new member of their company.\nNote that all of these will need to be installed by downloading a .deb file or adding a repository. Each has clear installation instructions, and they all also work across platforms (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS).\n", "Q: Swap not being detected on 14.04 LTS I upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04. When I opened my resource monitor, I noticed my swap was not detected. I installed Gparted, opened the program and started to look at my file tree. I noticed that my swap area was flagged as unknown, with a red exclamation point beside it. I formatted it as linux-swap, then selected 'swapon' from the menu. I reloaded the system monitor and it looked as if my problem was solved. \nI restarted my computer, opened up system monitor again, and I saw that swap was no longer there. In Gparted, this time the partition was recognized as swap, but the system did not see it. I need to `swapon every time my system reboots.\nI was first alerted to this issue when VMware told me that I had no swap. I thought I did, since all I did was upgrade my distro. My partition layout did not change at all during the upgrade process. \nI decided to use my gparted livedisk to format that same swap area (that you will see in the photos) as linux-swap. Before I did that, Gparted livesisk gave the same error that it was unrecognised. With the swap formatting completed, I restarted my computer, to find out that it did not boot. This time GRUB has an error. This has never happened to me before with distros, doing similar disk work.\nThen I decided to do a clean install of 14.04 from USB and CD, but I am still having the same problem. I tried (as you will see in photos as well) to 'swapon -a' from terminal with no success either (even though I am able to swapon from Gparted in the OS) - I get a directory error. \nThis is my fstab file:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

Could I have messed up my swap by formatting it in Gparted? It was unknown in the utility, since it was cryptswap.\nThis is my current state. As I said, I need to 'swapon' every time I restart.\n\n\nI have used Ubuntu as dual-boot for several years now. Since 6.06 \"Dapper\". I have used almost every distro and have never had this problem before. This is where I ask of your help and suggestion. I am no geek, only an enthusiast, and I posses basic skill and ability.\n\nA: Open terminal and run this command:\nsudo blkid\n\nIt will give you the UUID no's of partitions of your hard drive from them note the swap partition UUID no.\nNow go to fstab file as root in that file go to line under '# swap was on /dev/sda6 during installation' replace the UUID number under swap with the one you got from blkid command\nRemove the '#' symbol before the UUID it means that line will not run so remove it.\nAlso remove the below line completely /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\nNow reboot.\nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: Recover Files Using Live CD I've got a hard drive with personal files I need. Long story short, when I tried to update from 13.10 to 14.04, Ubuntu flipped out and bricked, and now it won't boot. I want to just do a fresh install of 14.04, but I need some files that are on the old bricked installation. I tried to use a live disk to just copy them to an external hard drive, but the system told me that I don't have the proper permissions to access or edit the files. How can I get these files off before I wipe the old installation and reinstall?\n\nA: There are two ways you could do this.\nIf your main computer is a desktop, then you could try using a SATA/IDE to USB. Some models don't support power through USB, you will need to use an alternative power cable.\nOr just try using sudo on the live CD to get permission to move the files.\n", "Q: I can't open any file from my (Samsung) S3 Mini on Ubuntu 14.04 I hate the way Samsung uses to transfer files, I wonder if there is a driver or something i can install to fix this problem because I downloaded a driver on Windows in order to use my s3 mini, I am new in Ubuntu so please someone help me please.

Installation was very easy. Even I installed Ubuntu on a bootable external USB-drive, to try it with several Computers. It works.\nInternet, drives, CD/DVD, Audio, Video, usb, SATA, ... : no problems.\nFor my printer (HP officejet pro 8600) I installed the HPLIP Toolbox, included in Ubuntu's \"software center\", and it works fine.\nOnly my scanner (Epson perfection 4490) does not work until now; though I had installed the driver packages offered by Epson and made recommended corrections in epson* files. But on other computer the scanner works with the same ubuntu (for that the external installation). Today I asked Gigabyte support. Perhaps they will give me a satisfactory answer.\nOf course, if you have other components, you will have more or less problems.\n2 new remarks:\n1. I forgot to say, that I use the Gigabyte Mainboard only in BIOS (MBR) mode, not in UEFI mode: In BIOS menu - BIOS Features - I set all Points which has a EFI choice to legacy or only legacy. With UEFI activated I got much more problems - in Linux and in Windows.\n2. Today I got this answer from Gigabyte: \"Da wir Linux und CO nicht testen / Supporten, können wir da leider nicht helfen.

Now I know that I will get to upgrade in June but I don't know if I should upgrade or not. Please give me suggestions.\n\nA: Your question is about when to upgrade and understanding Ubuntu versions (Releases)\nLTS releases are designed to be stable platforms that you can stick with for a long time. Ubuntu guarantees LTS releases will receive security updates and other bug fixes as well as hardware support improvements for five years. The current LTS release, Ubuntu 14.04, will be supported until April 2019.\nIn comparison, a regular release will only be supported for nine months. Considering new versions of Ubuntu are released every six months, you’ll have three months after a new version is released to upgrade to it or you won’t receive security patches anymore. \n\nYou’ll probably want to upgrade to every LTS version — new LTS versions are released every two years. If you stick with the LTS version, you’ll still get a new Ubuntu release every two years.\nLTS versions are designed to be more polished, while the standard releases bring you the latest features that may not be completely finished yet. \nWhen you use the latest release, you’ll end up upgrading every six to nine months. When you use the LTS version, you can upgrade every two years or even hold on for five years.\nThus, You should use Ubuntu LTS version for long-term-support latest version to meet latest features, (My advice is to use LTS to LTS version every two years!)\n\nHope this answer helpful to know about Ubuntu releases for new\nusers(Welcome!) to Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: You don't have to upgrade in June, considering that Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ends support in 26 April 2017. During this time, you will still get security updates from the Ubuntu developers (as well as for packages downloaded and installed from the Ubuntu Software Centre).\nWith that said, upgrading your Ubuntu computer will usually take a few hours and you will need to check the screen every so often if dialogs comes up.\nIMO, if you want to upgrade, you should wait for a few weeks until the new Ubuntu release becomes more stable as more bugs are fixed.\nIf you want the features in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (which you can look at this page here), then I suggest upgrading it.\n", "Q: where can i download these icon theme I am using 14.04 desktop, on web these tablet icon theme sets are showing off again and again.\nbut anyone knows how can i get them in use ?\n\n\nA: This themes can be downloaded from universe repositories for Ubuntu 14.04.\nOpen Terminal and Type Following Commands:\nsudo apt-get update    \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-mobile-icons\nsudo apt-get install suru-icon-theme\n\nYou can set it from unity-tweak-tool (can be downloaded by apt-get install unity-tweak-tool)\n\nTo set themes by terminal, type following commands with your theme name: \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme \"theme-name\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme \"theme-name\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme \"theme-name\"\n\n\nA: This is the Suru Icon Theme Package.

Go to https://www.youtube.com/html5 and mark that you want to use HTML5 whenever possible. To get the H.264 codec working in 14.04, you have to use a PPA as the package is not (yet?) available in the official repositories.

It seems to work well for all the basic functions and two and three finger gestures seem to be picked up by my applications, at least (ie firefox 3 button \"back\", scrolling). I would like to customize the gestures though, and maybe add one or two of my own to manage my workspaces/windows. I updated to 14.04 last night to see if multitouch support in the GUI was improved (it doesn't look like it).\n\n\n*\n\n*I have tried touchegg, but it seems like it relied on utouch which no longer exists in 13 or 14. It can't detect anything from my touchpad, even when I recompiled unity without multitouch, per http://ineed.coffee/1068/os-x-like-multitouch-gestures-for-macbook-pro-running-ubuntu-12-10/ . Most of the doco I've seen on it assumes you're using synaptics, so maybe that's the problem.\n\n*I have tried ginn, but encountered the same problem - it can't detect any input from my trackpad gestures.\n\n*I have tried easystroke, but it wants me to have a \"gesture button\" which enables gestures. I just want to do them without a special button. \nThis is driving me crazy. I understand that if I switch to Ubuntu Gnome touchegg should \"just work\". But do I REALLY have to change my whole shell interface to configure mouse gestures? Does Unity REALLY hijack the entire multitouch stack without exposing any of it in a configuration tool?\nI feel like this is so ridiculous I must be missing something obvious. Any advice would be welcome.\n\nA: On the latest ubuntu, all the advanced multi-touch only work from the touchscreen, not from the touchpad.\nSo what is left is:\n\n\n*\n\n*scroll (two fingers drag up or down), \n\n*list of running software (3 fingers double tap)\n\n*launcher (4 fingers tap)\n\n\nall the other advanced multitouch gestures are only available from the screen. I'm still puzzled by that design choice.\nTouchégg seems to work with 14.04 (I'm on 14.10, can't confirm/deny)\nhttps://code.google.com/p/touchegg/\n\nA: According to the Unity Gesture UI Guidelines only the \"4 finger\" and \"1 finger edge\" are hard-coded into Unity. I can attest to the fact that most gestures on Wacom tablets can be easily disabled without recompiling Unity (using xsetwacom), however the \"4 finger\" gesture that opens the dash (which is inadvertently triggered often by my knuckles while writing on the Wacom) is annoyingly persistent. \nUpdate: Recompiling Unity to remove the offending code which pertains to the four finger touches was pretty painless and well outlined in another thread.\n\nA: I have written a guide to do this. Basically, in order for this to work, you must use a forked syndaemon driver. You will also use a program called xswipe. Follow this link.\n\nA: Actually, all of these features still function on the touchpad. The only thing they did was add support for touch screen laptops/monitors. When they did this though, most of the default multi-finger gestures were moved to the touch screen. So if you want them on the touchpad, then all you have to do is set up the shortcut and the command, similarly to that which you would do for a keyboard shortcut.

I see the American Megatrends Boot Screen and then my Hardware Monitor, but I never see a purple screen come up, instead I get the Windows boot screen with the starting Windows caption.\nWhat have I missed?\n\nA: This Answer is assuming that your laptop is using UEFI.\nUEFI is the replacement for BIOS. Which provides an abstraction between Operating System and Hardware and is used to boot up your Computer.\nEvery new computer ships with UEFI as default.\nA Bit of Theory\nWhen booting up your computer the EFI System searches the active drives that are connected to your Computer for an executable in the folder /EFI/BOOT.\nIf such an executable is found the drive is considered to be bootable.\nThe BIOS on the other assumed that your boot manager is stored in the first section of the hard drive.\nWhat's Happening\nUNetBootin configures your USB Stick in the old MBR Style. (Which is that the first section contains the boot manager).\nYour UEFInow searches the USB Stick for the /EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI (or similar) executable and obviously can't find it so it continues, according to the boot order to search the next defined device until it finds one which contains said executable. This is why you can't boot from your USB Stick.\nFixing the Issue\nThere are two ways to fix your issue.\n1:\nIn order to keep compatibility legacy mode has been built into most EFI Systems which allow to boot from an MBR Partitioned drive. In order to activate legacy mode you will first have to disable Secure Boot because that will prevent you from Activating legacy mode and then you will have to activate legacy mode.\nThese Settings can be found in your UEFI Boot Configuration (or BIOS) under System Configuration and or Security.\n2:\nNowadays most Linux Systems support UEFI Boot. To make sure open your ISO (for Example with Virtual Clone Drive and check that the folder /boot/efi exists. If it does all you have to do is to format your drive to FAT32 and extract the content of the ISO into the root folder of the USB Stick (Copy Paste from Mounted Image or extract with WinRar). note: you still have to disable Secure Boot\nI hope my answer has shed some light onto the issue. \n\nA: Did your computer come with Windows 8 or Macintosh installed, if so you have the UEFI BIOS setup. To get it to boot of of the flash-drive you will need to disable secure boot, Intel SRT, and FastStartup. After that you should be able to boot to the drive. \nStop here if that worked, keep reading if you still can't boot into the flash-drive.\nIf you still cannot boot to the drive you should try to change the boot mode, there are normally only two options, UEFI and legacy (legacy might be CSM Boot like in the example below).\nIf you have any more questions or it still won't work let us know. I am certan everyone here is more than happy to help!\n\n\nA: I had this issue when trying to install Ubuntu 20.04 on a laptop that wasn't automatically recognizing the flash device as a boot option.\nIn the BIOS settings, under Boot Configuration, click add a new boot option to UEFI (not legacy boot). When a flash drive is plugged in, the middle value will be autofilled. Leave that. Choose any name and select the [. . .] button to open the ubuntu boot medium filesystem.\nNavigate to /EFI/BOOT/ and select GRUBx64.EFI. Make sure the checkbox beside the new option is checked. Now applying the settings, exiting, and smashing f12 to get to the boot options menu should let you choose that option you made.\nThis did not work for me when selecting /EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI, but it is worth a shot for anyone reading this.\n@spitterfly helped point me in the right direction.\n", "Q: How can I replace my windows partition with another Ubuntu based distro, in a dual boot system?

My partition table is this:\nDisk /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19457 cylinders, total 312581808 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x43c4e8b6\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *          63   160682129    80341033+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2       292045635   312560639    10257502+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       160684030   292044799    65680385    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       160684032   289968127    64642048   83  Linux\n/dev/sda6       289970176   292044799     1037312   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nPartition table entries are not in disk order\n\nDisk /dev/sdc: 8000 MB, 8000110592 bytes\n160 heads, 19 sectors/track, 5139 cylinders, total 15625216 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdc1              32    15625215     7812592    b  W95 FAT32\njohnny@johnny-FQ652AA-ABA-CQ2009F-NA910:~$ \n\n\nA: If you didn't care what was on the Windows partition (files, programs, etc) you could overwrite it by pointing the installer at that partition. If you still want the files on Windows, you would need to back those files up (or the enitire OS if you wanted) to external storage.\n\nA: I think you should first delete the unwanted partition(s) and point the installer to the empty space created.\n\nA: Actually you dont need to make a separate installation if your existing ubuntu installation is updated one (why do the unnecessary extra work?). It will be easy if your windows partitions are immediately near (continous) linux root partition. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to windows, make any windows primary paritions as logical, using maybe EaseUs partition manager. https://superuser.com/questions/552441/how-to-convert-a-primary-partition-to-logical\n\n*Boot from a live media containing Gparted.\n\n*Delete any windows partitions, and then expand your existing linux root (/) partition.\n\n\nIf your existing ubuntu is too old, then you will be completely running ubuntu on your box, and in that case, you dont have to worry about anything at all. Just delete the whole paritions, including the other ubuntu one. Be sure to have a swap partition.\nI appreciate your willingness to completely wipe away wondoz. Its a milestone! :) \n\nA: In the end, it was AuqustinJ suggested: Delete and then install. The procedure was as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Selecting the third option in the installer (as this was a\nUbuntu-based distro, the installer was the same) I selected the\nwindows partition for edit, then format as Ext4\n\n*Then, I selected the mounting point (in this case, /)\n\n*After that, just hit install. Presto!\n\n\nEverything went down smoothly. The only side-effect was the clutter in my Grub, after reboot...\n\n", "Q: Have tearing (no Vsync) in movies (Nvidia proprietary driver) This is more of KDE than Ubuntu question, but...\nI have visible tearing on screen. KDE composition, flash video in Firefox, and simple games like kpat are vsynced, but in steam games and in movies there is a distinct constant tearing. If I turn off vsync everywhere, the tearing is double as noticeable, so it is not just GPU ignoring the settings.  \nWhat bugs me most it that I'm having the same problem on many different setups. Does everybody have this problem and nobody cares? \nMy  setup\n\n\n*\n\n*Kubuntu (last few versions) or OpenSuse or Gentoo. \n\n*KDE 4.12 - 4.13\n\n*Nvidia GTX 260, 570, TITAN, different driver versions.   \n\n*I watch movies in SMplayer with mplayer2 backend. VLC has the same problem.\n\n\nWhat did I try (and it didn't help)\n\n\n*\n\n*Switching on and off in different configurations the Vsync settings in nvidia-settings and KDE Desktop effects. \n\n*Switching Mplayer output and direct rendering settings.\n\n*Turning off Adaptive power mode in nvidia-settings. \n\n*Turning off compositing \n\n*Changing monitor Hz\n\n*Running mplayer from CLI\n\n*Performing rituals and sacrifices\n\n\nWhat did work (but is not and acceptable solution)\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling KDE, and running Mplayer in pure X session\n\n*Switching to nouveau AND turning off composition AND opening video in fullscreen - without any part it is still tearing. \n\n\nPlease advice. \nUPDATE 1 I found out that if I go to Desktop Effects -- Advanced and change there anything valuable (OpenGL version, scaling algorythm) and push Apply, the tearing is gone until reboot. However, no setting solves this once and for all. After reboot I have to go and change something again.I guess it is enough to blame this on a bug, not my mistakes, so I will file out bug report.\n\nA: The source of problem was (of course) faulty nvidia drivers. The solution is simple. Add environmental variables:\nexport __GL_YIELD=\"USLEEP\"\nexport __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1\n\nsomewhere before X starts. System-wide /etc/profile/ works fine. \n\nA: Simple guide to solve this annoying problem :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Create file:\n/etc/profile.d/Tearing.sh\n\n\n*Insert this code:\nexport __GL_YIELD=\"USLEEP\"\n\n\n*Then make it executable with:\nchmod +x /etc/profile.d/Tearing.sh\n\n\n*Once that's done, reboot or press ctrl + alt + F2, login and run sudo service lightdm restart\nOr restart what ever your display manager is.\nThe GL_YIELD worked for me, and now vertical sync appears to be working as it should.\n(https://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?63946-No-vertical-sync-with-NVIDIA&highlight=tearing)\n\nA: I have tried all the tricks and nothing solved on Ubuntu 15.04 (along with xorg-edgers and nvidia-355) , until I came on nvidia archlinux page.\nTest with:\nnvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode=\"nvidia-auto-select +0+0 { ForceFullCompositionPipeline = On }\"\n\nIn order to make the change permanent, you need to add the following\nline to the \"Screen\" section of your Xorg configuration file, for\nexample in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf\nOption  \"metamodes\" \"nvidia-auto-select +0+0 { ForceFullCompositionPipeline = On }\"\n\n\nA: I had it nailed...\nSo - first of all be sure to check if the problem persists after you switch the Desktop Effects off (Alt+Shift+F10). I can guarantee that the problem might already be gone.\nGo to System Settings and open Desktop Effects:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scaling Method to something else than set currently <-- actual fix\n\n\nI know the options might not be named exactly as above. Sorry about that, but I am using the Polish version of Kubuntu.\nThe steps above fixed the problem for me. But only after a fresh install. :)\nEDIT: In the current 14.04 Kubuntu version the problem is connected with the Scaling Method. Changing it to anything else than currently selected, helps to resolve the problem TEMPORARILY.\n\nA: Removing NVIDIA driver solved for me.\nFor XFCE, the only thing that helped was replacing the window manager.\n\nA: I tried every suggestion to try and fix the screen tearing while watching videos in Unity, Gnome, and Gnome Classic on two computers (one with Nvidia Titan X and the other with an old Radeon card). Nothing worked. \nThen I noticed that when I switched the video output in my VLC setting from OpenGL to X11, the tearing went away but I started getting a lot of random black/white squares or \"noise\".\nTo get video playback to work, I installed Lubuntu Desktop which uses OpenBox instead of OpenGL. Lubuntu is a Ubuntu derivative that has LXDE installed by default. It is extremely lightweight and perfect for running in the background while you use Kodi and Steam, or just watch videos. \nWindow tearing may occur while dragging windows quickly, but this doesn't matter to me in this situation since I solely use Kodi and Steam in full screen mode on this computer.\nRun the following command to install both Lubuntu’s customized LXDE and vanilla LXDE on Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nUse this command instead to install only vanilla LXDE:\nsudo apt-get install lxde\n\nYou can also give LXDE a spin by downloading a Lubuntu live CD.\nEach environment differs only in its default settings. They come with different themes, wallpapers and panel layouts. For example, the Chromium browser is the default on Lubuntu, while Mozilla Firefox is the default on vanilla LXDE. Of course, you can use any browser you like with either. They both use the PCManFM file manager, a lightweight replacement for the Nautilus file manager found in GNOME.\nAfter installing either package, log out and select either the Lubuntu or LXDE session from the login screen.\nMy videos never looked better than in Lubuntu. I was able to bump my frequency up to 120Hz to match my TV. The playback was remarkably smooth for 1920x1080p.\n", "Q: How to Dual Boot Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Windows 8? I have a HP Pavillion Sleekbook Touchsmart PC with 4GB RAM and 500GB hard disk. I want to dual boot Windows 8(which came preloaded) with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. There are 4 partitions of the hard drive as follows:- \n\n\n*\n\n*C : Windows OS (104 gb free of 219 gb)\n\n*D : RECOVERY DRIVE (2.80 GB free of 26.1GB)\n\n*E : Software and Files (36.3GB free of 109GB)\n\n*F : Videos (43.7GB free of 109GB)\nI was Reading articles on the internet involving multiple paritions and it is giving me a headache. I want to know how to create appropriate partitions to run Ubuntu. Do I need to format my hard disk and combine it into a single one and then load Ubuntu.???\nI want ubuntu for the development tools. I am gonna be doing my coding there and also for watching some movies occasionally. Windows will be used for gaming and videos. So ideally out of the 500GB I would like to allocate Windows - 300GB and Ubuntu - 200GB. For any other media I can use an external hard disk.\nHow do I dual boot properly?   Windows 8 has Secureboot and UEFI also so I am not gonna try this dual boot unless I am absolutely sure. I do not want to lose Windows 8  also. Please help!!\n\nA: Your E: and F: are free of 109GB so, split any of one partition into two partitions on windows (can be done by partition manager in windows (+),  free edition of AOMEI partition assistant :http://www.disk-partition.com/download-home.html) or by Gparted Live CD.\n(+) when using partition manager, you need to make sure your HDD is defragmented!\nLeave new partition unformatted. Then reboot and insert Linux DVD or USB (+) (burned from iso)\nand choose Something else option.\n(+) recommend Rufus :http://rufus.akeo.ie\n\nThen choose unformatted partition on which you want to install Ubuntu. Create new of Ext4 file-system and mount point '/'\nBe sure to specify the size ... say 20000mb and set to primary partition\n\nThen Ubuntu will be installed on that partition be sure boot loader is in /dev/sda\n\nFor selection swap area use any remaining partition remaining partition and set it to logical partition, and split into two (split any one and create further 2GB is enough, but recommend double your computer's ram) format it as swap area '/SWAP'\nRemaining partition should be set to FAT32 with mount point '/Windows'.  This partition allows files to be accessed by BOTH operating systems.\nAfter installing Ubuntu you can select between Ubuntu and Windows to boot at GRUB menu.\n\nA: From your setup, its hard to get 200GB freed for Ubuntu. You can achieve this if you have  an external HDD (about  90GB in your case).\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup everything other than Win's partitions (C and recovery) to external media. Then delete Software and Videos paritions. This gives you 218GB free space\n\n*Install ubuntu to this free space, and you are done. Remember to create swap partition (min 40% of your RAM, max 100% RAM). It will improve performance. It the equivalent of Windows virtual memory.\n\n*For Dual Booting, just sit tight and relax while you install. ubuntu installation will automatically take care of that. Make sure you select Device for bootloader installation as /dev/sda\n", "Q: Why shell and browser return diffrent ip address?

It's not very clean and when I try to close the terminal, it say than I have an active process running.\nWhat can I do to make it work?\n\nA: Usually tmux should get the TERM parameter from your terminal emulator. So you could just set it to xterm-256color in your its configuration.\nIf this does not work for some reason, you can start tmux like that\ntmux -2\n\nThe parameter -2 forces tmux to assume 256-color support. Additionally you can set default-terminal in your `~/.tmux.conf\nset -g default-terminal \"screen-256color\"\n\n\nA: For proper installation, follow this order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install zsh\n\n*Run zsh from your terminal/bash\n\n*Set zsh as default terminal/bash\n\n*Setup tmux to run as default\n\n\n\nAfter zsh is installed, run it from terminal\n$ zsh\n\nnow set zsh as default Shell with\n$ chsh -s /bin/zsh \n\nNote that you must be on zsh when typing this command (tested this on my Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS - trusty)\nSO, now you've setup the default Shell... \nAll you have to do now is setup tmux as default, and it will load automatically zsh instead of the Bourne Again Shell (Bash).\nTo setup tmux as default, put this in your ~/.zshrc before your aliases; the code for other shells is very similar:\n[[ $TERM != \"screen\" ]] && exec tmux\n\n", "Q: How do I install the game eggnog (without using wine)?

I was able to achieve this by installing Gnome and doing this.  After I did it, the Gnome panel at the top and the Unity launcher on the left were overlapping in the top left corner.  I switched between Gnome, Gnome Classic, and Gnome Classic (no effects) at login screen several times (and installed some other packages including CCSM) and eventually they started playing nice together and the top of the Unity launcher starts under the Gnome panel.  After that, I stopped messing with it altogether for fear of them overlapping again.

Now, we need to actually mount the shared folder on the Guest OS. Run the following commands on the Guest OS, from the user's home directory :\nmkdir -p ~/shared3; sudo mount -t vboxsf shared2 ~/shared3 . Hereon, the ~/shared3 folder on the Guest OS will show same content as the Folder Path on the Host OS, and the folder will be readable/writable both ways.\n\nA: It`s important verify that you have upgraded the virtual box version.

Now creating directory -\nmkdir Share\nsudo chmod 777 /home/userName/Share\n\n\n*Now install guest additional package (Crucial step! People generally miss this which creates an error “Unknown file type “vboxsf”)\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-guest-utils\n\n\n*Now do the final step by mounting the folder (on guest OS)\nsudo mount -t vboxsf share ~/Share/\n\n\n*Done! now sync files between Host and Guest OS through virtual box.\n\nA: You have to mount your folder on your VM.\nFirst you need to install Guest Additions (although I already did this during the installation).\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your VM\n\n*Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image...\n\n*I had to manually mount the CD: sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom\n\n*Install the necessary packages: sudo apt-get install make gcc linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\n*Install the Guest Additions: sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\nNow you can mount your share using:\nmkdir ~/new\nsudo mount -t vboxsf New ~/new\n\nWhere New is the name of your shared folder.\nNow you can access the shared folder at ~/new.\n\nNote: this is not permanent. To permanently mount your folder you should add the following line to /etc/fstab (sudo nano /etc/fstab):\nNew /home/user/new vboxsf defaults 0 0\n\nObviously you should replace user in /home/user/new by your own username.\n\nA: I solved it by installing samba and sharing the folder with unity features. Then I could see the folder in the network of my virtual machine.\n\nA: The easiest thing to do would be to create a homegroup in windows if you are running the ubuntu OS in Virtual box for windows. Install guest additions. Then go to Files and look for Network. Ubuntu will help you join the home-group in windows and depending on how you have set sharing privileges, you can access, edit and transfer data.

I have successfully run Live distributions of Knoppix 7.2.00 & Ubuntu 12.04 on it earlier this year. However following the malware (most of which has been removed) I cannot run Ubuntu 12.04.41 live (or any other live distributions) or install Ubuntu 12.04.41 on the C drive (there is 50 GB free).\nWhen Ubuntu boots from the DVD, the program gets as far as asking whether to install/run from DVD, then goes to a purple screen with Ubuntu 12.04, with several flashing dots below it. After a while a series of error messages appear commencing with an error message B43/VCODES.FW, with a link to the relevant website. I have downloaded/run the drivers mentioned, but nothing changes.  \nI have tried loading Ubuntu 12.04 on a flash drive using Pendrive Linux, but despite the BIOS settings being set to boot from USB then DVD then C drive, the results are identical to the DVD. \nI really don't know how to proceed. I cannot erase XP & Picasa until Ubuntu (or another distribution) works and there seems to be no point in replacing the built-in (scsi) drive until it does. I have run out of ideas. All suggestions will be gratefully received.\n\nA: Could you try Ubuntu 14.04?  The B43 error you mention is a wifi error and could be solved by missing firmware.  I think it should be fixed in 14.04.  \nAlso, maybe your Mother's laptop has a rootkit, have you scanned for those?\n", "Q: ALC892 Low sound issue fixed with changing alsa config, why does it work? I updated to 14.04.  My sound immediately transitioned from being normal to sounding extremely quiet, sounding like it was at 5% of max volume, though all my volumes were set properly.  I tried lots of things to fix it by adjusting volumes, reloading ALSA, etc.  \nI then ran 'aplay -l' which output that I had an ALC892 sound card.  I google'd issues with 14.04 and ALC892 and found a solution which said to modify \n/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nand add to the end of the file:\nsnd-hda-intel model=generic\n\nIt worked and fixed it!  Now when I run 'aplay -l' it just reports my sound card as HDA Intel PCH.\nMy question is, why did this fix my sound?\n\nA: I'm not a massive expert in Linux, but here's my theory:\nInserting the command block code:\nsnd-hda-intel model=generic\n\n...tells us a few things by itself. Let's break it down a little.\nThe \"snd-hda-intel\" part obviously tells Alsa that the sound device header is an Intel-based unit. No brainer. However, the \"model=generic\" part is the interesting one.\n\"model=generic,\" to me at least, tells Alsa that we're looking for generic drivers of sorts for this Intel audio header. It's kind of like an override command so that Alsa looks exactly for the right stuff for the right hardware. \nThis recently became the issue for me the other day when I had to upgrade my computer from an old AMD FM2+ computer to a shiny new i3 - Alsa didn't immediately work with the new audio headers. That tells me that Alsa has a pre-defined library for more-than-generic audio devices. Therefore, specifying that you should use \"snd-hda-intel model=generic\" tells me that audio devices like the ALC892 need explicitly-stated libraries to work effectively, such as \"generic,\" for all intent and purpose.\nI'm not saying I know everything there is about the topic, as this is simply estimating from my own experience. I am aware the post is a bit aged, but I think an answer of some kind should at least be explained...somehow.\n", "Q: Compiling Intel-phc says I don't have headers Trying to follow an online tutorial \"Intel-phc with latest kernel on Ubuntu\".

I'm running Mailman 2.1.16rc2 on Ubuntu 12.04. That's the most recent version available via apt-get install.

I'd like to continue using apt-get updates to find new versions of Mailman in the future, but the version I want is not currently available in the standard repositories.\n\nA: You can use utopic's Mailman 2.1.18 package on trusty. (Source: I am using it, for precisely this reason, see Background below.)\nTo install it via apt-get, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, configure the utopic repository by creating a file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/utopic.list with these contents:\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu utopic main restricted universe multiverse\n\n\n*Next, configure the system so that it does not automatically install packages from utopic (since otherwise you will upgrade to utopic the next time you run dist-upgrade). Create a file /etc/apt/preferences.d/utopic with these contents:\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=utopic\nPin-Priority: 100\n\n\n*Finally, install the mailman package, explicitly instructing apt-get to use the utopic version:\napt-get update && apt-get install mailman/utopic\n\nCaution\nUsing packages from a newer release on an older release is not supported. If something goes wrong with this process you will likely be on your own bug-wise. However, I can confirm that my Mailman lists work after doing this.\nUpgrading\nYou should remove the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/utopic.list and /etc/apt/preferences.d/utopic files before attempting any upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu from trusty.\nSources\nThese are based on the Ubuntu Backport instructions, substituting \"utopic\" for \"trusty-backports\"\nBackground\nI also wanted 2.1.18, because the \"ALLOW_FROM_IS_LIST = Yes\" feature in 2.1.16 is list-wide. I don't want to re-write everyone as \"from is list\", just Yahoo users and others with a DMARC p=reject policy. 2.1.18 has a per-sender feature accessible from Privacy options → Sender filters in an individual list's admin interface.\n\nA: It's not possible to install the latest version of mailman(2.1.18) via apt-get until the repositories are updated.\nThe current  version of mailman package avilable in the main repository is 2.1.16-2.\n$ apt-cache policy mailman\nmailman:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 1:2.1.16-2\n  Version table:\n     1:2.1.16-2 0\n        500 http://ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/Linux/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: Just add the following line to /usr/lib/mailman/Mailman/mm_cfg.py\nALLOW_FROM_IS_LIST = Yes\n\nThen a new option from_is_list will appear on each list's \"General Options\" page.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04, how to set middle mouse emulation?

But in the top right corner of my Gnome Shell screen I have a little \"en1⌄\" menu which offers me a choice of UK or US keyboards.\nAs I have no plans to move across the ocean, being constantly offered a foreign keyboard layout is not useful; it is screen junk.\nSo I went to Keyboard Layouts and removed the US layout, leaving just the UK one. The menu disappeared - great...but turns out that now it thought my keyboard had gone all American - press # and I'd get \\!\nEnable the US keyboard, and it goes UK again(!).\nIt's only annoying, but wondering if anyone can fix?\nEDIT: Screenshots added:\nGnome's System Settings:\n\nRegion & Language\n\n\n\n\nA: You can try to edit the panel.js file located in the /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui/ directory.\nNote: I have two keyboard layouts (Es , En). First I will create a backup of the file and comment the line 855 to remove the keyboard indicator in the gnome panel without removing a keyboard layout.\n1) Open a Terminal window Ctrl+Alt+T and type:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo cp -p /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui/panel.js /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui/panel.js.bak\n\n*sudo nano -c /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui/panel.js\nComment or delete the line 855 (You can use the double slash \"//\" for single line comments)'keyboard':imports.ui.status.keyboard.InputSourceIndicator,\nTo save the changes in nano.. Ctrl+O,Enter then Ctrl+X.\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nFinally to see the changes you can logout login, restart the panel or reboot your machine.\n\nNow if you neeed to change the Keyboard layout you can use the shortcut Ctrl+Space.\n\nImportant: Just in case ... remember you have the file panel.js.bak as a backup.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Goto System Settings then Text Entry and uncheck the option Show current input source in menu bar. That's it.\n\nA: The answer is that you cannot do this at the moment, due to known bugs.\nI reported this bug and it's been merged as a symptom of a bigger one:\n\nThere is a monster bug about keyboard layouts in launchpad. Still basically\n  unsolved; the interactions between gnome-control-center, input methods, KBD\n  options and co& are a real nightmare. \nThe bug title is just one of the symptoms. The behavior reported here was\n  commented somewhere... at least I think. \nSee\n  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-settings-daemon/+bug/1218322\n\nSo while you can remove it, doing so does not fix the problem. Also, as the keyboard layout gets reset to US whenever Gnome Shell crashes and you can only remedy this by changing the layout back to US (the indicator does not register the reset) and then back to UK again, removing the indicator would not be convenient.\nI thought there might be a setting somewhere, which is why I asked the question, but it turns out it's a bug.\n", "Q: Eclipse stopped working with Ubuntu upgrade to 14.04 Two days ago I upgraded to the latest Ubuntu 14.04.

That one is incomplete, presumably because you did not copy the entire thing.\n\nIt seems as though something is overwriting your xorg.conf file.

I've never seen an identifier that includes a space which is why I used the former, but you might need to use xrandr --output \"HD LVDS-0\" --auto --right-of MI-0 instead.\nIf these commands successfully switch between your desired layouts (if not, let me know and we can tweak them), you can turn them into a simple script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nif [[ $1 = \"off\" ]]; then\n    xrandr --output LVDS-0 --off \nelse\n    xrandr --output HDMI-0 --auto --primary --output LVDS-0 --mode 1920x1080 --right-of HDMI-0\nfi\n\nSave that as switch_screens.sh and make it executable (chmod +x switch_screens.sh).

Opts: (null).\nI then made a new USB with Ubuntu Server 12.04.4 to install that again, but when I choose \"Install Ubuntu Server\" from the GRUB-menu the system just reboots. Same thing if I choose \"check disc\". I then thought the USB-Drive maybe was faulty. So I got a new one and tried with that, same thing.\nThe system I have is ASUS E45M1-I DELUXE AMD FUSION E-450 MINI-ITX.\nWhat can I do to make a successful install of Ubuntu?\n\nA: I actually ran into this issue and was VERY frustrated by it.  I noticed it happening when I ran 14.04 (only OS installed on 500GB HDD) on my server box, but did not have the issue if I ran the installation from my windows workstation.  What I found during my poking around was that it has something to do with a video driver check on boot--at least, in my case, that is what it was.  To get around it, when the Grub2 menu comes up, select the option to boot in recovery mode.  Once the menu comes up, select the option to continue booting into your Ubuntu install.  Once you have logged in, bring up the terminal and edit the /etc/defaults/grub file and find the line for kernel boot options.  Typically, it will have something like \"quiet splash\" or something along those lines in the quotes for this option.  Add \"nomodeset\" to just before the closing quote (without adding the quotes around it) and save the file.  Back at the terminal run \"sudo update-grub\".  This will apply this on boot.

It uses the Intel HD Graphics of the built-in Intel I5. (Some more information: 16 GB Ram, 500 GB HDD and 128 GB SSD.)\nI'm running the 12.04 LTS.\nHere the output of the requested command:\nlspci | grep VGA\n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n\n--\nIt also seems to be a unity problem. I switched to Gnome classic and it runs fine. Also this problem occured just two days ago.I didn't use the Laptop for about a week, started it 2 days ago(usually its always in standby-mode, but it may have run out of power) and then recognized the error. After that i installed all updates, but the error is still there.\n--\nOkay, its gone. \nI ran Ubuntu-Tweek's janitor, which basically clears/removes the apt-cache, old kernels, package configuration and unneeded packages. Then i restarted unity and it looks all good.\n\nA: This glitch is due to system cache accumulation. Therefore one can solve it by clearing cache. To do this one may use Ubuntu Tweak's 'Janitor' feature. For installing Ubuntu tweak use the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nThen open it from the dash. One can also open it from the terminal with the command:\nubuntu-tweak\n\nThen one should select Start Janitor. Then select the cache one desires to clear from the subsequent window and then press Clean to remove cache. This should remove all unnecessary cache and solve the graphical glitch too.\nIf this doesn't work one may try making edits in CompizConfig settings manager which can be installed from here:\n\n", "Q: No Longer Able to Create Live USB I've tried all of the suggestions I could find from forums and Q&A sites (like this one), but I am still not able to live boot Ubuntu 14.04 from USB.\nI am using a SanDisk Cruzer 32GB.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reformatting as FAT32\n\n*Wiping and rebuilding the MBR\n\n*Using several different tools including unetbootin and the built-in live USB creator\n\n*Checking boot flags\n\n*Recreating the partition table\n\n\nYes, my BIOS recognizes the drive.

Any Ideas?\n\nA: I've figured out my issue, hopefully it will help you, Andrew.  In looking at the Partitioning options for the USB key, I see that there was an MBR and a GPT option.  You have to ensure you are partitioning with MBR.  GPT appears not to create a partition recognized by UEFI or legacy BIOS.  I repartitioned, ensuring MBR was selected, reformated FAT32, and now have two USB keys that work, the Corsair Voyager 16GB and the SanDisk Cruizer Glide 32GB.  \n", "Q: What does unmounting partitions do? Okay, so I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS once. It didn't have an option to \"install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8\" and the advanced partitioner had no option to make a new partition. I then disabled fast boot and tried again. This time, it asked me if I wanted to unmount partitions in use, showing \"/dev/sda\" as the partition in question. Apparently this is in fact the hard drive.\nChoosing \"No\" just leaves me with the same problem as before. I am extremely hesitant to press \"Yes\". It is fundamental to me that Windows 8.1 (side note: it was an upgrade from the preinstalled Windows 7) is kept, and even more so the files within it.\nWhat exactly does unmounting do? Should I press yes? If I shouldn't, what else can I do?\nPlease note that this is my first time installing any operating system apart from Ubuntu 12.04 once with Wubi and Windows 7 as well as my Windows 8 install.\n\nA: Unmounting of a file system removes it from the mount point, and deletes the entry from the /etc/mtab. Some file system administration tasks can't be performed when the file system is mounted.  Such as checking and repairing of the file system, formatting, and more\nFile systems are automatically unmounted when the system is shut down. To manually unmount file systems, use the umount command.\nEdit:\nWarning:  Always be careful when dealing with partition.  Make sure that you have a backup available just in case.\nUnmounting is necessary to partition the drive, and create space for Ubuntu.  It is OK to press Yes, but you need to be careful when partitioning, that you don't wipe that whole drive.  I would recommend that you boot from the install DVD/USB, click on Try Ubuntu, use Gparted to shrink the partition, and create a partition for Ubuntu. \nIf you like, that can also be done from within Windows.

I installed Ubuntu 14.04 from a DVD yesterday over my Ubuntu 12.10 installation and have found that, despite there being a Windows 8 entry in grub2, only Ubuntu will load. If I select the Windows 8 entry Grub reloads. I get a UEFI menu if I press F10 after switching on the computer, but the Windows entry loads grub. There may be an error message generated here, but it is only on screen for a fraction of a second and I've not yet been able to capture it. I have tried rerunning Boot-Repair using the Ubuntu 14.04 livedvd and the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sh -c \"sed -i 's/trusty/saucy/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nI selected the 'Recommended Repair' option and I got a warning about errors occurring and this link to share: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7340206/ \nAs before, Ubuntu boots fine but I still cannot load Windows 8 either from Grub or from the UEFI menu.

I don't believe that I have any other Windows utilities. \nI am happy to provide further logs and pictures of my BIOS settings if required. I have also posted in the Boot-Repair thread on the forums as well as emailing boot.repair@gmail.com as advised by Boot-Repair. Thank you in advance for any help that you can offer.\nEdit: as requested here is the update-grub output:\nsudo update-grub\n\nGenerating grub configuration file ...\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-24-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-24-generic\nFound Windows Boot Manager on /dev/sda2@/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\nAdding boot menu entry for EFI firmware configuration\ndone\n\nAlso, this might be related to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1308758\n\nA: Your problems are caused by an overzealous Boot Repair operation, which has resulted in GRUB being installed in place of the Windows boot loader. It may be possible to repair the damage by running Boot Repair again, entering the Advanced menu, and selecting the option to restore backed-up files. This should return the Windows files to their original locations, which should enable your new GRUB or the firmware's built-in boot manager to launch them. If that fails, you may need to use a Windows recovery disc to re-install the Windows boot loader.\n\nA: I can now boot Windows 8. Following instructions from the Boot-Repair team, I backed up my current bootmgfw.efi and reverted the backup copy:\nsudo mv /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw2.efi\nsudo mv /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi.bkp /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\nsudo modprobe efivars\nsudo update-grub\n\nUpon rebooting my computer, I can now access both Ubuntu and Windows. \nThis might be similar to what happens in the process that Rod Smith suggests above, but I thought that I'd detail exactly what I did to restore my Windows 8 access. \n\nA: I had a similar problem - Windows 8 machine that previously had dual boot working - did not allow Windows boot.\nOP's solution (re-enabling the backed up EFI file) did allow me to boot Windows again - but then GRUB would not show and I was stuck with only Windows. I was able to re-enable GRUB by running this command in Windows:\nOpen an Administrator Command Prompt window and type:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nCredit\nP.S. Added an answer because I'm not allowed to comment nor vote [??]\n\nA: I solved the issues you comment several times using these methods:\nFrom Linux (1st method)\nAfter using the Boot-repair tool using an Ubuntu LiveCD/USB, please reboot. If you can get access to your installed Ubuntu OS, then install the Grub Customizer:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nYou can open the Grub Customizer by searching \"Grub\" on Dashboard and verify if Ubuntu & Windows properly recognized and configured on List configuration (first tab). Also you can modify the desired OS to run, the time to wait until your preferred OS start and many more in the General settings (2nd tab), or use a theme/ your own background image in the Appearance settings (3rd tab).\nFrom Linux (2nd method)\nIf you can't get access to your Ubuntu installation after running the Boot-Repair tool and reboot, then download the SuperGrub2 disk. This LiveCD/USB tool help you to search&find any Boot record inside your HDD in order to help you to boot from it and repair any broken entry. I recommend you to play the video tutorial you'll find on the author's web page. After the broken Boot issue is solved, please use the Boot-repair program, or the Grub-Customizer tool I mentioned above...\nFrom Windows (3rd method)\nIf you can't boot into Ubuntu partition but Windows OS works fine, you have another method using the EasyBCD application. In a nutshell, EasyBCD is a free (for personal use) program that allows you to create any Boot entry from several sources, such as CD's/DVD's, USB drives, ISO image files, FAT/NTFS/Ext4 partitions and many more. I recommend you to read the guide you'll find on the official website, because here have some methods to made Windows & Ubuntu can coexist pacifically on your HDD.\nFrom Windows (4th method)\nIf none of these 3 previous methods works for you, the I suggest to create a new MBR using the recovery options your Windows8 have (no Windows install DVD is required).\nIf you can boot into Windows8, press the Windows+C combo key (no matter if you're on desktop or tiles mode) and click on \"Settings\" ->\"Change PC Settings\" -> \"Update or recovery\" -> \"Recovery\". Finally click the \"Restart\" button under \"Advanced startup\".\nAfter your computer restarts, you'll see \"Choose an option\". Please select the OS you want to repair, and click \"Troubleshoot\" -> \"Advanced options\" -> \"Automatic Repair\".\nIf you can't boot into Windows8, turn OFF your computer and then turn ON. Before the Windows Logo appear, press the F8 key several times until you see the advanced boot options. If you can get this screen, turn ON your computer and turn OFF while you see the \"Windows is starting\" message (or the Windows animation logo) and made this step a couple of times (normally 2 times is enough), until you see the advanced boot option (a message asking to \"Repair your computer (recommended)\" will appear). Using the arrow keys, select \"Repair your computer\" and hit Enter. (If this option is not available means your manufacturer doesn't include preinstalled recovery options; in that case you'll need to create a USB/DVD recoveryusing this guide ). Select the keyboard layout, and click \"Next\". Finally click \"Startup Repair\" on the System Recovery Options menu. if this process fail, then open the command prompt and put these commands and reboot: \nbootrec /fixmbr\nbootrec /fixboot\nbootrec /RebuildBcd\n\nThese commands will help you to create a new MBR on your HDD. Later you can use any of the previous methods I described above to repair the Ubuntu Boot...\n", "Q: \"Unable to locate package cinnamon\" when trying to install cinnamon i want to install cinnamon on ubuntu 14.04, but i get an error \"unable to locate package cinnamon\"\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\nE: Unable to locate package cinnamon\n\nyes, i did try sudo apt-get update and it didn't work.\n\nA: You are receiving this error because there is no stable version of the cinnamon package in ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev for trusty - it's under development (now cinnamon nightlies are only available for trusty).

This should pull in any other packages it may need. You can see dependencies here:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/misc/unity8-desktop-session-mir\nIt shouldn't break anything.

The simplest solution is to change the encoding of the files:\niconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf8 document.tex > newdoc.tex\n\nTo do this for all tex files in your current directory, run this:\nfor f in *tex; do mv \"$f\" \"$f\".bak && iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf8 \"$f\".bak > \"$f\"; done\n\nThe command above will first rename each .tex file to filename.tex.bak, then change the encoding of the copy and save it as filename.tex. So, if you have a file named foo.tex, you will end up with a file called foo.bak.tex with the original encoding and the foo.tex with the UTF8 encoding.\n\nAnother problem you are likely to encounter is that Windows uses \\r\\n as a line ending while Linux & co use \\n alone. You are therefore likely to want to change this when working on Linux. To convert windows line endings to Unix style, do\nsed -i 's/\\r//g' filename\n\n", "Q: Switching to lubuntu does not work I just upgraded my older laptop to Ubuntu 14.04 and I want to try something more lightweight.\nSo, I installed lubuntu-desktop as recommended in how to replace ubuntu with lubuntu and it made no difference.\nWhen I purged unity and unity-2das recommended in Is there an easy way to change Ubuntu flavor during upgrade?, the unity Panel on top of the screen disappeared but no new menus are available and pressing the \"start\" button (on the left) does not do anything. I hoped that I would see something similar to the pre-unity ubuntu, but this did not happen.\nSo, how do I switch from ubuntu to lubuntu (without burning a CD and installing from scratch? (or at least get a working ubuntu back!)\n\nA: *\n\n*After you install Lubuntu-desktop package, you can start to use lubuntu, I am also using lubuntu. \n\n*When you see the login screen, at the upper right corner, try to change it to lubuntu, then you can use it as lubuntu :)\n", "Q: How to create a user who can only access one directory? I'm running Ubuntu Server 12.04. I was wondering how I can set up a user to only access one directory.  For example, I want to create a user 'brad' and want him to only have access to /var/www/brad. There, he can add and edit files as he pleases.  Also, how could I give him access to phpmyadmin to create db's?  \n\nA: sudo adduser brad\nsudo chown brad:brad /var/www/brad\n\nman adduser and man chown for more information and advanced options. Notice the chown above will only give ownership of the directory, use -R flag to do it recursively. Also notice no other user except brad will have ownership of said directory. You might need to change permissions for other users with chmod. Read about file permissions here.\nYou can also do:\nsudo chown me:brad /var/www/brad\nSo you are the owner and brad is the group which has access to it (brad is the only member of said group). Or the other way around:\nsudo chown brad:my_group /var/www/brad\nNotice www-data might need access to said folder (and sub-directories and files) for the webserver to function properly.\n\nAlso how could I give him access to phpmyadmin to create db's?\n\nYou should configure that in your webserver / through phpmyadmin. If permission is denied for some reason, just adjust it with chown or chmod.\n", "Q: ctrl+alt+l not activating screensaver When I first installed Ubuntu 14.04 the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+L would activate the screensaver.

I downloaded Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS to my Windows 7 64-bit computer, but when I try to open and run the download, I receive the following message:  Windows can't open this file. How do I open and run this file?\n\nA: Unfortunately it doesn't quite work like that.\nUbuntu is an Operating System much like the windows you are running. The download is a bootable image which can't simply be 'run'. There are two main options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install it as a virtual operating system (using a program such as Virtual Box) which would allow you to run it inside your current Windows operating system.\n\n*Install it as a base operating system on the computer you intend to run it on this would have nothing to do with windows whatsoever (although there are ways of having them side by side on the same computer [known as a 'dual boot'] which would allow you to select whether you want to start Ubuntu or windows when you turn on your computer).\n\n\nMethod two would certainly give you the most out of your Ubuntu experience. For this you would have to burn the downloaded image to a CD using image burning software (not just writing the file to the disk conventionally). After burning this disk you would have to boot into it by changing your BIOS's boot order on start up. After that, it would be quite straight forward. There are plenty of forums and youtube videos that could help you with this.\n\nA: If you have software for the ISO file, like daemon tools, you can install Wubi (14.04 supports it). Other ways are to boot from real DVD.(where the Ubuntu iso is burned) or VM.\n", "Q: Have encrypted my disk and need swap space I have just installed xubuntu 14.04 and elected to do the encryption (not the full disk, just the ubuntu part and my home dir). I realized however that I failed to create any swap space. When I run gparted it shows just two partions sda1 (/boot) and the rest of my SSD sda2. But gparted does not list how much of sda2 is used or unused. why? \nI'm not sure if I can at this point create any swap space, because of the encryption during the installation. What should I do, and how do I do it with gparted. Gparted does not seem to let me resize the partitions. \nmy gparted window looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition  File Sys   Mount pt   Size     Used           Unused      Flags\n\n*/dev/sda1 (keys) ext2 /boot 243MiB 53.17MiB 189.83MiB boot\n\n*/dev/sda2 extended (blank) 476.7GiB  --- --- (blank)\n\n\n*\n\n*Which partition should I try to change, and how (to create swap from it)?\n\n*Is it not possible to alter a partition without corrupting the encryption?\n\n\n\nI have 16GB of RAM, and I do use the machine for scientific computing.\nThank you!\nPaul\n\nA: You can create a swap file instead of a swap partition if you like.  To create the swap file in /home, you would run the following commands (this creates an 8GB swap file):\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/.swap bs=1M count=8K\nsudo mkswap /home/.swap\n\nThen, you would want to add the following line to your /etc/fstab file:\n/home/.swap  none   swap   sw   0   0\n\nFinally, run sudo swapon -a to activate your swap.  You can change the commands and the fstab entry above to change where the swap file is being created.\nYour swap will be encrypted automatically if the file is created within an encrypted partition, but it will not be accessible until after the encrypted partition is unlocked, which may cause problems with it not being automatically activated at boot.\n", "Q: Why this script doesn't work in cron and generates a empty output?

I can not find any instructions for installing Windows after Ubuntu is already installed. I am only finding instructions for doing the opposite, Installing Ubuntu after Windows 8.\n\nA: Installing Windows after Ubuntu is easy.  Just Install it as you normally would.  Windows give you the option of choosing the partition where you want to install it.  Choose the partition that has sufficient space and run your install.\nAfter you do this it will boot to Windows.  You won't see Ubuntu.  You'll have to run a grub update procedure to get Ubuntu to boot again.\nThis isn't as complicated as it might seem.  The official ubuntu support site has the procedure here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\nWhile there are other boot managers I prefer Grub.  So I would recommend reinstalling grub after you install Windows.\n\nA: *\n\n*Use GParted to divide the partitions.\n\n*Then install Windows on that new partition, so Windows won't take over Ubuntu partition. \n\n*After that, boot with portable Ubuntu CD or pendrive, install Grub bootloader, so you can see back your Ubuntu.\n:)\n", "Q: Where can I find a unified explanation of lower-level filesystem structure in Ubuntu? This is not a duplicate question about file-system hierarchy that can be answered by pointing me toward man hier, ubuntu-policy, or something.  I've looked at those questions.

I'm sure documentation exists concerning all these directories, but since they are standard to Ubuntu, it would be nice if a hierarchy document covered all their various purposes, perhaps even with links back to the documents to their related services/applications.  \nThe reason why I want this is because it cuts down on time and confusion spent looking through Google etc. when I encounter a problem if I already know where directories associated with some problem reside.\n\nA: You can maybe start from http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/, and follow from there to the Linux standard base project, at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/lsb.\nTake into account however that each distribution decide where to put is files, so although much of them follows these standards, there are differences among them, and often even among packages in the same  distribution.\n", "Q: Update-Manager stuck while installing package to upgrade from 13.10 to 14.04 Update-Manager appears to be stuck.\nlast package installed appears to be an apache module, but I didn't realize I had installed apache (possible a prerequisite for another package installed?).\nI left it for about an hour hoping that it would progress but the bar never moved and last installed package hasn't changed.

So I used a live USB to mount my original disk drive and recover my files, before reinstalling everything.

You should be able to access boot repair from the live USB this way. From all I have gathered, grub doesn't boot live systems unless they have been previously installed to do so. If there is a way do do it, I would like to know also.\n\nA: Reset your bios to boot the usb drive first, then let it go.

I have a 120 GB SSD so I would very much like to see my disk space usage at all times. Is there any way to get the status bar back or are there alternative file managers which support the feature?\n\nA: I had the same problem when upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 recently - and I wanted to see the free space on the partition.\nSo after searching a while, I decided to code my own plugin that does just that, because I couldn't find anything that does that out of the box. \nIf it helps anyone, here is the link: \nhttps://github.com/climaxx/Nautilus-Status-Bar-Replacement\nIt displays the free GB amount in a text bar below the address bar. \nFor files I use Alt + Enter to see the file size and I am used to that.\n", "Q: How well does Ubuntu handle real time audio? I want to ditch Windows for one of my PC's because Windows can't handle my music without stuttering due to latencies. How well can Ubuntu handle real time audio?

How do I find the flash drive so I can access it and its files.  Is there something I have to do in the terminal, or is it a simple setting change.  please help.  Thanks!!\n\nA: On a normal vanilla Trusty Tahr install, your system should auto-mount a USB flash device and add an Icon to the left hand tray in Unity.\nYou can also press super/windows key, and search for the \"Files\" application, which should show you all the files in the current directory, and on the left hand side show all storage devices, including any mounted USB or removable devices.\nFinally, you could open a command prompt/terminal and run the command mount and review all of the storage devices listed. This may appear cryptic and depending on your experience level, you may not recognize the device in the list if it is there.\nUsually, removable devices are mounted in the path /media/<device name>/ or possibly /media/<your-user-name>/<device name>\n=== Edit ====\nThe Disks utility will also display all attached storage, whether it is in a readable/writable state or not, so long as the OS recognizes it as storage.a\n\nA: After reformatting a flash drive using the file app, it must be remounted before it can be used. Reformatting leaves it in an unmounted state. The fix:\nunplug the device and plug it back in to automount the device.\n", "Q: Thunderbird stuck at \"Checking password...\" I hope it's not improper to post a question about Thunderbird on here, but I didn't find their site too helpful.  \nThe other day my Thunderbird stopped syncing with my email. I've tried everything I know to do (including re-installing Ubuntu) and I'm still getting a problem.  Specifically, when I go to setup an account, I get to the last step and click \"Done,\" but the account is never created because it is stuck on \"Checking password...\"  When I first setup Ubuntu 14.04, it worked flawlessly, but now even after a re-install, Thunderbird is giving me this problem.\nPlus, all of the information I have input into Thunderbird is correct.\n\nA: I solved the problem by removing my proxy settings for FTP and SOCKS.

For now though, I'm satisfied that the problem is fixed.\n\nA: I wasn't able to use the above answer because there was no apt.config file in the directory /etc/apt on my computer. \nI was getting this error while trying to set up an existing Gmail account using Thunderbird. After launching the Mail Account Setup dialog box and entering my e-mail and password, I clicked on \"Manual config\" at the bottom of the dialog box and switched the authentication from OAuth2 to Normal Password for both the incoming and outgoing settings.

The reason for this issue is described in the answer of What does 'without password' mean in sshd_config file?\nCan you check it out?\n\nA: Are there any user accounts on the system besides root? If so, you can SSH into one of the user accounts and use sudo. If not, I guess you'd need KVM access to login as root directly.  If you can't do that, I guess you'll have to start over.  \nIf you can, save the filesystem image so you can mount it later and access your files.  \nIn the future, make sure you set up a user account with sudo permissions, and use ssh-copy-id so you can login with a key.\n", "Q: Adobe Flash Player Issue In Chromium In Ubuntu \nPlaying Youtube videos in chromium I got the following issue\n\n\n\nFlash play is already installed on the system.

To unlock, simply activate your display (if it got turned off), and blindly type in your password. \nNote that there will not be any sort of indication of echo back of the password you type. You will see a plane blue screen. Type the password and hit enter to unlock.\n\nA: To invoke a \"lock\" from the command line, you can accomplish this with gnome-screensaver-command -l, based on this Q/A: How do I lock the screen from a terminal?\nHowever, for a \"clear\" locking solution you can try xtrlock.\nsudo apt-get install xtrlock\n\nThen you can invoke it from a terminal:\nxtrlock\n\nThis will allow you to continue to view the desktop, while remaining locked.  To unlock it, just type your password.\nNote: I was confused by this at first, because it never presents you with a dialog or prompt to enter your password.  You just start typing it, and it unlocks when you hit Enter.\n\nA: On Ubuntu (with the default desktop settings), locking the desktop is done with Ctrl + Alt + L.\nEdit: I believe Super + L works too in recent versions of Ubuntu, which is the same as in Windows. \nNo additional software is required.\nThis will not halt or pause any software.

Instead you will need to upgrade to the versions in between, in turn.  This means you'll need to upgrade first to 13.04, then 13.10, then 14.04.\nThe available upgrade paths between Ubuntu versions can be described like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can upgrade from any version to the immediate next version.\n\n*If you have an LTS version you can also elect to upgrade to the next LTS version, skipping the versions in between the LTS versions.\nIf you are on a non-LTS version (such as 12.10) your only upgrade path is to the immediate next version.  To reach subsequent versions you must do multiple upgrades.  Or you could do a fresh install.\n\nA: You have upgrade to 13.04, 13.10 then to 14.04. If you want directly Ubuntu 14.04, download Ubuntu 14.04 , make it usb/disc bootable with 14.04 then select Upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04. This will upgrade whole Ubuntu except for /home directory (as it contains user data).\nThis will install fresh copy of whole Ubuntu, so before that backup your installed Softwares/packages & configurations with the help of this post. here\nOR else just use this software Aptik to avoid commands.\nAs per comments, do this Upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04. As you have downloaded Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, make a DVD or USB bootable. This can be done with many different softwares. One of them is Unetbootin. Select your platform on which you will be using this software to make USB/DVD bootable. Then follow this video.\nAfter making usb bootable restart your pc & go to BIOS or else just press F11/F12 & select your pendrive name & select Boot Priority Device as your Pendrive.\nUbuntu 14.04 will start then select Install Ubuntu then after selecting place,keyboard settings(default), username & password, select Upgrade to Ubuntu Trusty Tahr 14.04.This will upgrade your Ubuntu to 14.04.

Mine throw syntax errors or get interpreted locally! I have a command like this which tells me if a system has a disk that's getting full (>=70% full):\nif [[ -n df -PTh|column -t|awk '{print $6 $7}'|awk -F\"%\" '{printf \"%-9s %-5s\\n\",$1,$2}'|grep -v -e \"Use\" -e \"Mounted\"|awk '$1>70{printf \"%-9s %-5s\\n\",$1,$2}' ]]; then echo \"not present\"; else echo \">70 is present\"; fi\n\nI'd like to  want to perform the above command on a remote server using using SSH. Something like:\nssh remoteserver \"if [[ -n df -PTh|column -t|awk '{print $6 $7}'|awk -F\"%\" '{printf \"%-9s %-5s\\n\",$1,$2}'|grep -v -e \"Use\" -e \"Mounted\"|awk '$1>70{printf \"%-9s %-5s\\n\",$1,$2}' ]]; then echo \"not present\"; else echo \">70 is present\"; fi\"\n\nBut when I tried that, I got the following error:\nHOST: remoteserver bash: -c: line 0: syntax error in conditional expression bash: -c: line 0: syntax error near /home'\nbash: -c: line 0:if [[ -n 92 /home'\n\n\nA: First of all, I'd reduce that war-crime of an awk/grep/awk/grep/awk/grep/etc statement down to:\ndf | awk '$5~/([7-9]|10)[0-9]/'\n\nIt does everything you need to check output. You could add a {print ...} clause to the awk statement if you really needed pretty output but given that you're just checking to see if there is output, let's be reasonable about this ☺.\nWe can also shorten the if/else. I've also corrected the direction — yours was reversed. The whole command now looks like:\n[[ -n $(df | awk '$5~/([7-9]|10)[0-9]/') ]] && echo 'ACHTUNG!' || echo 'No >=70s'\n\nI think you'd agree that's just slightly more edifying.\nNow you could probably escape this manually now and wrap it in a bash -c \"...\" but where's the fun in that? Instead let's save the command into a local file (say commands.txt) you can send that to the server like so:\nssh user@host $(<commands.txt)\n\nAnd you could leave it there. You could actually throw a working version of your original command in there and send that over. This thing is pretty robust... But we don't want to do that... Not when we can be more clever (and cheaty) with the command and do away with the if brackets (which are the things causing the escaping problem).\nWe are currently running df remotely and processing it remotely. We don't need to do that. We could let ssh just run df and then handle the output locally. That instantly nixes the escaping problem but we're currently tied up in logic [[ brackets ]] which would make the rewrite a bit ugly:\n[[ -n $(ssh user@host df | awk '$5~/([7-9]|10)[0-9]/') ]] && .......\n\nYuck.\nWe are better than that.\nUnlike the monkeys and apes who trod before us, we have exit codes.\nWhen something finishes running, it can return a code. These codes mean various things but generally speaking 0 means \"I did exactly what I was designed to do\" and anything higher means \"I did bad, Bawss\".\nConditional hooks like && and || look to the exit code feeding into them to decide whether or not to run. In our case this means if we tell awk to exit in a non-zero way, we can control the code flow:\nssh user@host df | awk '$5~/([7-9]|10)[0-9]/ {exit 1}' && echo 'No >=70s' || echo 'ACHTUNG!'\n\nThis also means that it will exit as soon as it detects the first >=70 value. If you had millions of drives, that could save you seconds over other leading-brand scripts. So yes, just to reaffirm what's going on in this final version:\n\n\n*\n\n*We are connecting to the server and running df remotely\n\n*The output is piped back to a local instance of awk\n\n*awk looks to see if the fifth column matches a regex to match 70-100\n\n*If it does, it exits code 1 and the || code executes (there is a drive over 70% used)\n\n*If it doesn't, it exits code 0 and the && code executes.\n\n\n\nIn previous revisions I also had a NR>1 check in the awk statements but given we're explicitly checking the value of the fifth column (and it has the be a number to work), we can safely omit that too.\n", "Q: Can not Upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 When I try to upgrade from Ubuntu Gnome 13.10 to Ubuntu 14.04, the upgrade application fails with the following message:\nCould not calculate the upgrade. \nAn unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade.`\n\nHere is the complete log:\n$ cat /etc/issue\nUbuntu 13.10 \\n \\l\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n$ sudo do-release-upgrade\nChecking package manager\nReading package lists...

Unfortunately i3 automatic install it's own notification daemon, dunst that \"conflic\" with notify-osd. So, I just have to uninstall i3 and all fixed.\nsudo apt-get purge i3 i3-wm i3lock i3status dunst\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nkillall dunst\n\n\nA: I'm guessing a package is missing.  Try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, which should install any missing packages.  If that doesn't fix it, maybe you disabled something in a config file or an autostart .desktop file.\n\nA: All you need to do is to remove the dunst notification daemon\nsudo apt-get remove dunst\n\n", "Q: How synaptic \"Add Downloaded Packages\" Works? I have downloaded deb packages.\nWhen I use synaptic- Add downloaded packages It just download some packages but not add (install) my all packages (Even main package!).\n\nAccording to my assumption, This option should add my deb packages to /var/cache/apt/archives. Then prompts to download if any dependency-package missing. Then Installs packages.\nHowever I can installs packages by dpkg -i *.deb. But it not check if any package missing and not prompt to auto download them. \nSo, suggest alternative GUI or CLI tool [if not available then appropriate commands] for dpkg -i *.deb to get above mentioned work efficiently (check+auto download+install) or How to solve no-efficient working of synaptic's Add downloaded packages?\n\nA: You're doing it wrong way. The \"Add downloaded packages\" item serves another item, \"Generate package download script\".\nHow does it work?\n\n*\n\n*Select packages that you need to install/upgrade. For example, monodevelop and wine. Synaptic will select a lot of other packages.\n\n*Generate download script. Save it on removable media.\n\n*Bring the script to another computer (with rapid network) and execute the script. It will download needed packages.\n\n*Bring packages back to original computer and add downloaded packages through Synaptic.\n\n*PROFIT!!!\n\nAnd to install some downloaded packages, the gdebi is appropriate. Simply type gdebi *.deb and it will download dependencies and install all the packages specified.\n\nA: dpkg does not download dependencies; it simply checks to see if the required packages are installed.  apt, aptitude, and synaptic download dependencies.\nHowever, they download dependencies based on the information contained in the configured package repositories.  You can't feed apt or Synaptic a deb file and have it download the required dependencies.  You must try to install it yourself with dpkg, and then install any required dependencies yourself.\n", "Q: How do I install syncdrive? I am trying to install syncdrive in 14.04.

There is no need to run it with sudo. The update-alternatives --install made soft link needed to launch Eclipse. That's the purpose of this tool.\nHowever, if you install Eclipse from Software Center, it may override this link, so it is better to place it in /usr/local/bin. This directory has priority when executing commands by default.\nOther solution is to manually sudo ln -s /opt/eclipse/eclipse /usr/local/bin. Notice that I'm using /usr/local prefix because it's more appropriate in this case.\nUPD: It seems something wrong went while you was unpacking Eclipse. The execution bit has gone.

Alternatively, you can use iptables and masquerading to achieve the same, though it'll be without a GUI. More information can be had on http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO/firewall-examples.html\nFollowing is a sample script that you can run on the server.

Means I want display PulseAudio volume of particular sinks in % \ni.e. 50%\nI already set the volume using pactl set-sinks-volume 1 50% command. But now i want to check is it 50% or not.\nSo how can i do this?\n\nA: You can use pactl list sinks to get info on the current state of your sinks. This returns a lot of information, including the volume. So, to get only the volume of sink 1, you can use:\npactl list sinks | perl -000ne 'if(/#1/){/(Volume:.*)/; print \"$1\\n\"}'\n\nThis will return something like:\nVolume: 0:  50% 1:  50%\n\nThe above perl command will print the details of sink 1. To use a different sink, change the #1 to another number, for example #0.\nI am not sure what the two 50% mean, I assume they are the left and right speaker volumes. So, in order to check if they are above or below a specific value, (assuming that the balance is set to \"center\", that both left and right volumes are identical so only one needs to be checked), you can do:\npactl list sinks | perl -000lne 'if(/#1/){/Volume:.*?(\\d+)%/; $1 >= 50 ? (print \"y\\n\") : (print \"n\\n\")}'\n\nThe above will print a y if the volume is greater than or equal to 50 and an n otherwise.

You can lock this topic. Thanks to Nattgew.\n\nYou see, I need to install certain Intel graphic drivers for which I tried to download the \"Linux Intel graphic driver Installer\" (http://bit.ly/1kbIcKm).  \nHowever, when Ubuntu Software Center opens the .deb file it tells that there is a dependency issue because it needs libglib >=2.37.3 version.\nI have tried to do what I always do in these cases and use the console to update the libraries with \"sudo apt-get install libglib-2.0\", but it tells me libglib is already up to date.\nWhile I am not good at all with these things, I evena tried to install it by hand. I went to linuxFromScratch (http://bit.ly/1hFY9u7) , downloaded the libglib2.40.0 library and installed it manually. It apparently worked because the file appears in usr/lib/pkgconfig.\nThe thing is that I am STILL getting the message of \"dependency issue\". Do you know what could be the problem? Maybe Ubuntu Software Center is not detecting the correct library?\n\nA: If you don't use a .deb file to install, i.e. when you do a make install like the instructions you linked, then the Ubuntu software system (apt) knows nothing about you installing that library. So as far as Ubuntu Software Center is concerned, the libglib package is still at the Ubuntu version. You have two options to resolve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force the .deb file to install, ignoring the dependency issue. Hopefully the manual library install worked and the program will function properly.\nsudo dpkg -i --force-depends *.deb\n\nYou can replace the *.deb with the specific package file name, otherwise it matches all .deb files in the directory.\n\n*Upgrade Ubuntu. The latest two Ubuntu versions (13.10 and 14.04) have versions of libglib-2.0 that meet the requirements (>=2.37.3).

So, if I want to start three processes all at the same time, I have to use three terminal tabs.  I'd rather use one tab that returns to the bash prompt as soon as the process, say konsole is launched.\nThat would enable me to launch any number of processes from that one terminal tab.  I could then automate it with a script, and launch the processes one by one from there.  Is there a way to make kdesudo or kdesu or any similar programs work that way?\n\nA: One way of doing this would be\nsudo bash -c \"command 1 & command2 & command3 &\"\n\nThe & symbol sends a process to the background. The -c flag to bash tells it to launch a new instance and execute the commands given by -c. So, the command above will launch all three programs at once.\nHowever, if you want to do this in a script, don't use sudo in it at all. Just launch the script with sudo. For example:\n$ cat foo.sh\n#!/bin/bash \n\nkonsole &\nfirefox &\nxclock &\n$ sudo ./foo.sh\n\n", "Q: How to alt+tab between more than 2 windows in GNOME 3? I have recently upgraded Ubuntu from 13.04 to 14.04. Soon I have noticed that the most commonly used short cut, Alt+Tab, had changed its meaning. It switches now only between the current and the previous application. Pressing Tab more times does not have any effect.\nI have discovered that super+Tab behaves like old Alt+Tab. I tried to change short cuts, but all changes seem to be completely ignored(!). \nHow can I repair Alt+Tab to work as previously? \n\nA: Just install the AlternateTab extension by gcampax: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/15/alternatetab/\n(This took me about 10 seconds of Googling, I don't even use Gnome 3)\n\nA: Changing shortcuts works fine, but a restart  or re-login may be necessary.

Please see the image for an example. I tried reinstalling, purging, allowing for newer sources and installing again but nothing works. Does anyone know or have an idea on how to solve this?\n\n\nA: Removing and even purging a package does not remove its user specific configuration files. Seeing how your problem persists across reinstalls it might be a good idea to reset your configuration to the defaults. \nOne way to do this is by renaming the existing configuration files and directories. In case of Okular these would be:\n~/.kde/share/apps/okular\n~/.kde/share/config/okularpartrc\n~/.kde/share/config/okularrc\n\nYou could rename them to okular_backup, etc.\nTry to start Okular now and see if anything changed. If you are still facing the same issue you are likely dealing with a bug and should probably report it to KDE's bug tracker.\n", "Q: Not able to see Kate Plugin for Javascript in Kubuntu I installed Kubuntu 14.04 recently. I had heard about the Javascript related plugins(Pretty JSON specifically)  being there in Kate setup. But it does not show up in any of the options. I am not sure if I need to install that separately. Any help with that regard would be awesome. \n\nA: I was able to setup kate-plugins including the java-script ones but did not find Pretty JSON anywhere. I even tried asking on the IRC and the mailing list about this but did not find a response. You can however, install and access the plugin as follows:\nOpen a terminal(Ctrl+Alt+t) and type the following one line at a time:\nsudo apt-get install git\nsudo apt-get install python-kde4 python-jedi ipython\n\nThis will install the necessary packages for the plugin. After this, the plugin needs to be cloned from github since it is not available in the ubuntu repositories. For this do the following on the terminal:\nmkdir build && cd ~/build\ngit clone https://github.com/goinnn/Kate-plugins\nln -s ~/build/Kate-plugins/kate_plugins/ $(kde4-config --localprefix)/share/apps/kate/pate\n\nNow, you can access the plugins in Settings -> Configure Kate:\n\n\n\n\nA: In Kate, you can use different \"Modes\" to affect the highlighting and indentation the way you want it to. Usually, Kate picks this up automatically, but if you need to change it manually, look under Tools > Mode.\n\nAs you can see, there are also options beneath Mode in Tools to affect the highlighting and indentation individually. Using Modes simply sets both the highlighting and indentation to the same thing.\n", "Q: Check condition in shell script I have the following command:\npactl list sinks | perl -000ne 'if(/#1/){/(Volume:.*)/; print \"$1\\n\"}'\n\nit returns the output as:\nVolume: 0:  50% 1:  50%\n\nit denote the pulseaudio volume for sink 1 is 50%.\nSo I want to check it in if condition \nthe volume <= 50% or not\nSo how can i do this?\n\nA: You can use the following command (enhanced version of terdon's proposal):\npactl list sinks | perl -000ne 'if(/#1/){/Volume:.*\\s+(\\d+)%.*\\s+(\\d+)%/; exit(1) if ($1>50 or $2>50)}'\n\nIt will check that both Left and Right channels are above 50%, and will exit with the value 1 (0 instead)\nYou can check the exit code with echo $?:\n$ pactl list sinks | perl -000ne 'if(/#1/){/Volume:.*\\s+(\\d+)%.*\\s+(\\d+)%/; exit(1) if ($1<=50 or $2<=50)}'\n$ echo $?\n0\n\nUPDATE:\nTo include the following command in a shell script, simply use the following snippet:\n#!/bin/bash\n\npactl list sinks | perl -000ne 'if(/#1/){/Volume:.*\\s+(\\d+)%.*\\s+(\\d+)%/; exit(1) if ($1>50 and $2>50)}'\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Volume > 50%\"\nelse\n    echo \"Volume <= 50%\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: I installed the wrong version of Ubuntu on my computer.

The problem comes with the nvidia drivers. All the 3 monitors (2 external + the internal one) working only when I'm using the nouveau drivers.\nUpgrading from 14.04 to 16.04 doesn't effect that behaviour, 3 monotors still working with a minor cursor flickering that you can get used to it.\nHowerver updating to 16.04.2 caused me some issues on the screen attached on the mini display port since it seems that the output isn't hardware accelerated.

I recently installed 14.04, and decided to do so as a fresh install.\nI wiped the only Ubuntu installation on the system, left a Windows 7 installation on, and installed over mdadm (once with /boot on mdadm and later with it not on mdadm as that saves a few other headaches. I'm pretty sure what I'm describing happened in both cases).\nEverything from previous Ubuntu installations were completely wiped by manual formatting of the relevant partitions.\nI'm in a time-zone currently on Irish Summer Time (UTC+01:00). Windows started jumping the time an hour ahead.\nNow, I might expect a default Windows installation to jump the time an hour back, thinking the UTC bios time was the local time, but this was an hour ahead and I had RealTimeIsUniversal set in the registry to get some saner behaviour out of Windows.\nAfter some puzzling over this, I realised that in /etc/default/rcS there was the line UTC=no to set Ubuntu onto local time rather than the normal UTC=yes.\nThis is a well-known setting for people who normally only use Windows as the illogical choice of local time (not unambiguous) means less change for them than fixing Windows in a way that MS don't support, but I certainly didn't set it.\nThis was easily fixed, but as I don't know what broke it, I don't know that it won't be broken again.\nIs there anything that sets UTC=no upon use or installation, and if so can that be blocked?\n\nA: If you install Ubuntu on a clean disk with no other OS, UTC=yes is used as default. In your situation, you have Windows aside Ubuntu. So in the installation Ubuntu detected Windows and set UTC=no. Although your Ubuntu is clean, the disk is not clean. \n", "Q: dependency problems running apt-get -f install on Ubuntu On my Ubuntu Rackspace server:\n# uname -a\nLinux myserver.com 3.2.0-24-virtual #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon May 21 18:44:18 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n# apt-get -f install\nReading package lists...

An assignment has the form var=string. When an ARGV[i] is examined as a possible file argument, if it is empty it is skipped; if it is an assignment argument, the assignment to var takes place and i skips to the next argument; else ARGV[i] is opened for input.\n\nFrom man gawk:\n\nIf a filename on the command line has the form var=val it is treated as a variable assignment. The variable var will be assigned the value val. (This happens after any BEGIN rule(s) have been run.) Command line variable assignment is most useful for dynamically assigning values to the variables AWK uses to control how input is broken into fields and records. It is also useful for controlling state if multiple passes are needed over a single data file.\n\n", "Q: Error Install ubuntu on lenovo notebook g510 I'm tried to install ubuntu desktop 14.04 on my notebook lenovo g510 (AMD radeon HD8570) but after installation finished when OS starting display following massagge: The system is running in low-graphics mode.\nCould someone please help me to solve this problem?\nThank's in advance\nMaurizio\n\nA: Did you already try the solution suggested at How to fix \"The system is running in low-graphics mode\" error?\nLooks like your graphics driver was not installed (correctly).

I got the initial info for how to do this (manually) from this question/answer: \nHow to disable recovery mode/single user mode?\nSo I wrote a simple script, which is packaged up with a replacement grub file.  The script simple does:\n# Move the new grub file contents into place\ncat /path/to/replacement/grub > /etc/default/grub\n# Update grub with the new settings\nupdate-grub\n\nIn this script the \"/path/to/replacement/grub\" has these contents: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7328274/, and replaces the standard file http://paste.ubuntu.com/7328269/ that's in the system.  The system is Ubuntu 12.04, and the script above is run as sudo.  \nThe problem is that most of the time it works, but some of the time it completely nerfs grub, and when the system is rebooted, it lands at the grub command line, rather than booting normally.  From the grub command line, I can load the kernel, boot linux, and then when at the bash command line, I can run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen reboot, and everything is then fine.  But can anyone tell me why sometimes it doesn't just work as part of the script?\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*The goal is simply to remove the recovery mode boot option from the grub menu, with no user intervention other than running the script - the reasons for this are complex, but that's the way it is :)\n\n*The only difference between the 2 grub files should be the uncommenting of the line 'GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=\"true\"'\n\n*I cat the contents into the correct file (instead of cp'ing or\nmv'ing) because I figured it was the easiest way to ensure that file\nperms weren't messed up. \n\n*The process usually works, and rebooting the system removes the recovery mode grub menu option (as desired).

UMTS provider and SIM card is Vodafone. Wireless WWAN is working well under Windows XP, but um my second System, UBUNTU 14.04 only WLAN has functionality.\nDoes anybody know a software connecting the existing hardware to UBUNTU 14.04?\n\nA: Go to System Settings > Software and Updates > Additional Drivers\nI have gut feeling your module will be there and it will need to download additional drivers. (best doing of this is when you have some alternative connection available)\n\nA: I had a similar issue with a 6930p, un2400 WWAN card and Ubuntu 12.04. Both the 2300 and the 2400 have the same issue – on startup, the driver needs to load the firmware into the card. Being a proprietary binary blob, the firmware cannot be shipped with Linux – one needs to download the Windows driver installation package from HP and extract the firmware from it. With this hack it is reportedly possible to get the card to work under Linux.\nAnother approach might be to install a different, more Linux-friendly PCI-e WWAN adapter. Unfortunately I do not have any reliable reports of PCI-e models that are known to work. I have been able to use a Huawei USB adapter as well as an Option Express Card adapter, both of which were recognized out of the box, thus PCI-e adapters from these vendors might work too. I have also used an Ericsson F5521gw PCI-e adapter with a different laptop, which is supported out of the box but has a bug (most likely in the firmware) that causes it to lock up and refuse to reconnect until the next reboot.\nI ended up working around the HP WWAN issue by using the USB stick, and on the other machine I live with the Ericsson bug.\n", "Q: How to remove window decorations (title bars) from Ubuntu 14.04 I never used window decorations to maximize / minimize windows, but keyboard and mouse/keyboard shortcuts for all operations.\nIn the good olde days, you could just disable and tweak the window decorations plugin from Compiz settings manager. In 14.04, this is not possible. \nHow can one get rid of the top window bar with the close / minimize / maximize buttons?\n\nA: Fortunately, all Unity decorations are defined by the Unity gtk3 theme (see this document), and one can remove the top decoration with one little change.\nHowever, just to be on the safe side, I do make a backup copy of a whole theme. Here is what I do:\ncd /usr/share/themes\nsudo cp -a Radiance Foopance\ncd Foopance\nsudo cp index.theme index.theme.orig\nsudo sh -c \"sed 's/Radiance/Foopance/g' index.theme.orig > index.theme\"\n\nOne last thing to do is to modify (as root) the file /usr/share/themes/Foopance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/themes/Foopance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css\n\nChange the line -UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 0 0 0; to \n-UnityDecoration-extents: 0 0 0 0;\n\nThis is all it takes.

Can I upgrade to 14.04 directly from 11.10, or is there a certain upgrade-path one needs to follow?  Also, is 14.04 stable enough, or is it better to stick to an earlier version for now?\n\nA: Hi & Welcome to AskUbuntu,\nLooking at your current version (which is 11.10), you cannot easily upgrade your system to the latest 14.04 directly at once. Refer to Upgrade Notes listed under Ubuntu wiki which explains everything about the process.\n\nWell, before you do anything relating to update/upgrade, make sure\n  you've backed-up important stuffs & your update manager core is\n  up-to-date.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're trying to achieve this using the internet, then you will need to upgrade to 12.04 (LTS) release & then upgrade it to the latest 14.04 (LTS) release. \n\n*If you want to achieve this with a latest iSO downloades, then simply back-up your necessary DATA(s) and then do a fresh installwhich would indeed save more time. It saves you from arising issues that you will have to face after upgrading since its from an older version to the latest version.\n\n\nSo to summarize, your best bet over the internet is from 11.10 -> 12.04 (LTS) -> 14.04 (LTS) or to simply download a fresh copy of 14.04 (LTS) & get it installed. There are plenty of Q & A's discussing similar issues. Though the question are older and explains about older version, I'd still suggest you to go through \"Can I skip over releases when upgrading?\" & \"How do I upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu?\" for more understanding on upgrading.\nLTS stands for Long-Term Support. The term itself explains you the stability of the system. And Ubuntu will keep on releasing necessary patches, updates frequently to make the system more stable that you don't need to worry about.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: System tray icons disappeared after upgrading Ubuntu I have many applications with tray icons like davmail, hardware monitor.

You can also have the icons show in the bar itself and instructions for that can be found here: http://www.webupd8.org/2015/05/on-demand-system-tray-for-ubuntu.html\nWhy don't the other solutions work anymore? Updates to Unity keep breaking the other ppa solutions and it seems no one is committed to keeping them up to date.\n\nA: Enable Skype Icon on Unity Notification Panel on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nWhen you do a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 (Or any version with Unity for that matter), you install Skype and expect it to work as it used to. But if you close the main window - you soon notice that Skype icon is not being displayed in top panel.\nTo fix this you will need to run a few commands. So open up your terminal and run this:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist\n\nYou should get something like this:\n['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'Update-notifier']\n\nBasically this means, that Skype is not whitelisted, thus is not allowed by default to display its tray icon. We need to fix this. Append 'Skype' to the list so that you have something like this:\n['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'Update-notifier', 'Skype']\n\nThen wrap it with double quotes (”) and add gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist in front of it. At this point you should have something like this:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'Update-notifier', 'Skype']\"\n\nNow just copy this to your Terminal and execute the command. Reboot afterwards. Now you should see the icon.\nSource: Enable Skype icon on Unity notification panel on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - Tautvidas Sipavičius\n\nA: You may need to do two things:\n1. Install the sni-qt libraries.\nInstall sni-qt  (click on the link), or with sudo apt-get install sni-qt sni-qt:i386 from the terminal, and then restart Skype. The tray/panel icon should now be back!\n\nThe reason this step is required is because sni-qt is installed automatically by the Ubuntu repository Skype package, but NOT by the Skype deb you directly download. Once Skype 4.0 is in the Ubuntu repos, you can install from there and this will no longer be necessary.\n\n2.

Double-click on the orange [JavaEmbedded...] part on the right, and add ,'skype' to allow the Skype indicator to show, as below:\n\n\n*Press Enter, close dconf editor, logout and login -- your indicator should now be back!\n\nA: This is because Ubuntu has turned off whitelisting since version 13.10.  Here are two options to fix:\neither\nsudo apt-get install libappindicator1\n\nor       \nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:gurqn/systray-trusty\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nFor more information:\nSystem Tray icons not showing\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2217458\nhttps://launchpad.net/~gurqn/+archive/systray-trusty\n\nA: Go to the Skype->Options.\nIn the General Category check \"Start Skype minimized in the System Tray\".\n\nA: I'm using Gnome-Flashback (formerly Fallback/Classic) with a tint2 panel. I tried all of these fixes and none of them worked for me. I even tried\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:timekiller/unity-systrayfix\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nNo luck. Even tried killing tint2 and using the gnome-panel instead. Still no icons for many, but not all, of my apps.\nI finally found a solution while looking for a way to get(specifically) the network manager to show in the systray here. Since I use Cairo-Dock as a launcher, I just changed all the launch commands for my apps that weren't showing up to dbus-launch app-launch-command. Where app-launch-command is the regular launch command for that app. Did the same for Startup applications and it works like a charm.\n\nA: This solution works fine with Ubuntu 17.04\n\nSimply run the application with \"env XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity\". For\n  example, to start Skype For Linux, you would use:\nenv XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity skypeforlinux\n\nTo make the fix permanent, copy the application desktop file from\n  /usr/share/applications/ to ~/.local/share/applications/, then edit\n  the file and change the \"Exec\" line by adding \"env\n  XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity\" (without the quotes) immediately after\n  \"Exec=\".\n\nMore details at http://www.webupd8.org/2017/04/fix-appindicator-not-working-for.html\n\nA: I had the same issue.

I have a 120GB SSD hosting my Ubuntu installation.\nI have four 3TB Western Digital Disks which I would like to configure into an LVM.\nIf I reinstall Ubuntu at any point in the future onto the SSD or indeed change the SSD for another, is it possible for me to access the LVM partitions etc. afterwards?\n\nA: yes, as you can verify by building a small test diskset (for example by combining a handfull of files) and accessing it lateron from another installation or even a live CD / USB stick / whatever.\nDon't forget to install the lvm2 package to the installation you want to use, if it isn't already present.\nas root (or with sudo)\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get install lvm2\n\n*pvscan will show if the physical volume is detected\n\n*vgscan searches for the volume group\n\n*modprobe dm-mod to load the module\n\n*vgchange -ayto activate the volumes\n\n*lvscan should now show the logical volumes as active and mountable\n\n\nsee also: how to move volume group to another system\nI'd also recommend to use vgfcbackup to backup the configuration info of your volume group.\n", "Q: User name recover from cosole I have \"The system is running in low-graphics mode\" problem and I tried the recovery mode (Recovery Mode/failsafeX) and it didn't work. \nIt happened after and update  \nI searched for a solution and found the manual so i went with the (Ctrl+Alt+F1) for manual fixing\nthe problem is i don't remember the user \"or if it is Case sensitive\" \nMy question is: Is there a code typed in the console to recover or show users list of sort to confirm my username or if it is case sensitive ?\n\nA: First of all, yes user names are case sensitive. In general, in the Linux world, assume that everything is case sensitive, there are very few (if any) exceptions. By default, all user names are lower case so unless you have changed something, yours will as well.  \nNow, to list the users available on the system, you can do this:\n sudo cut -d: -f 1 /etc/passwd\n\nIf you are currently logged in, you can find out your username with\nwhoami\n\nIn bash and some other shells, the username is stored in $USER as suggested by Avinash but that is not always the case:\n$ echo $USER\nterdon\n$ USER=bob\n$ echo $USER\nbob\n$ whoami\nterdon\n\n\nIf you have forgotten your username, this will not help since you won't be able to connect. The easiest workaround would be to use an Ubuntu CD/USB and boot into a live session. Log into your live system and mount the / partition of your installed Ubuntu. This is usually /dev/sda1 but that will depend on your setup. If you need help figuring out which to use, edit your question and add the output of running sudo parted -l from the live system. Anyway, assuming the partition is indeed /dev/sda1, you will need to run these commands to mount it:\nsudo mkdir oldroot\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 oldroot\n\nOnce you have done that, get the list of users on the system with\n sudo cut -d: -f 1 /oldroot/etc/passwd\n\nAlternatively, you can list the contents of /home, your home directory is usually the same as your username:\nls /oldroot/home\n\n", "Q: Wireless connection wt 2000 pci In windows 7 I connected to an wireless network tp-link with no problem using dhcp and wifi card wt 2000 pci,but after I installed ubuntu 14.04 and when I connect to the same network it connects but no internet also using dhcp,I tried also manualy adding the ip address but still the same it connects with no internet,so where is the problem there?\nThank you all for answers.\njasmin@jasmin-desktop:~$ ifconfig\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:785 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:785 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:64412 (64.4 KB)  TX bytes:64412 (64.4 KB)\n\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:4f:6a:05:ca:df  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.6  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::24f:6aff:fe05:cadf/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:320 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:839 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:138298 (138.2 KB)  TX bytes:109630 (109.6 KB)\n\njasmin@jasmin-desktop:~$ ping google.com\nping: unknown host google.com\n\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 wlan0\n192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     9      0        0 wlan0\njasmin@jasmin-desktop:~$ \n\n\nA: Install ndiswrapper\nsudo install ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-modules-1.9 ndiswrapper-utils-1.9\n\nInstall the WiFi driver (from Windows):\nsudo ndiswrapper -i yourdriver.inf\n\nCheck the driver is working:\nsudo ndiswrapper -l\n\nLoad the module:\nsudo depmod -a\n\nsudo modprobe ndiswrapper\n\nConfigure modprobe so that it loads ndiswrapper:\nsudo ndiswrapper -m\n\nEdit the modules to add ndiswrapper at the end:\nsudo gedit /etc/modules\n\nRemember to add ndiswrapper at the end.\nHope you now have your WiFi up and working!\n", "Q: Problems using custom keyboard layout / symbols file I have a custom xkb symbols file which looks as follows:\n// modify the basic German layout to have polish characters\ndefault partial alphanumeric_keys\nxkb_symbols \"basic\" {\n\n    include \"de(basic)\"\n    name[Group1]=\"Germany - with polish characters\";\n\n    key <AD03>  { [         e,          E,      eogonek,      Eogonek ] };\n    key <AD09>  { [         o,          O,       oacute,       Oacute ] };\n    key <AC01>  { [         a,          A,      aogonek,      Aogonek ] };\n    key <AC02>  { [         s,          S,       sacute,       Sacute ] };\n    key <AD06>  { [         z,          Z,    zabovedot,    Zabovedot ] };\n    key <AB02>  { [         x,          X,       zacute,       Zacute ] };\n    key <AB03>  { [         c,          C,       cacute,       Cacute ] };\n    key <AB06>  { [         n,          N,       nacute,       Nacute ] };\n};\n\nThe name of the file is depl.

This is another question all about the usability of unity, which is proving to be not as easy to customise as I'd like. Using Ubuntu 14.04, When I click on the files icon, it immediately takes me to $HOME. However, I would like to set it it to, for example, $HOME/Desktop/folder. This would make my navigation much better. \n\nA: You can make your own launcher.   \n1) On a terminal: gedit ~/.local/share/applications/mylauncher.desktop \nThen paste this into the file:   \n#!/usr/bin             \n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nName=Nautilus Desktop\nExec=nautilus Desktop\nIcon=nautilus\n\n2) Mark as executable:  chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/mylauncher.desktop \n3) Logout and log backin.   \n4) Open the dash (press Super) and search nautilus. When you find it, drag it to the launcher.   \nEnjoy.\n\nA: To change the default directory of the Files icon:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the default nautilus.desktop file to your local directory:\ncp /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/nautilus.desktop\n\n\n*Open the file with gedit (open gedit, go to ~/.local/share/applications, drop the file on to the gedit window)\nEdit the (first!) Exec= line of the file to open the alternative directory to Exec=nautilus /path/to/your/directory. However, I would prefer not to do that: \nIt would be better to add a directory to the nautilus (\"Files\") icon permanently,  accesible by right-clicking the icon:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the default nautilus.desktop file and open it with gedit like above, \n\n*Paste the following at the end of the file:\n[Desktop Action Desktop]\nName=Desktop\nExec=nautilus /home/yourname/Desktop\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nThen look for the line starting with Actions=, add the name of your new mention (in this case Desktop) + ;, so the complete line should look something like Actions=Window;Desktop;\nAfter logout / login it works.\nAlternatively, you can use a quicklist editor to add or remove items to the launcher items.\nAnother tip Last but not least: whenever you are in a directory (in nautilus) and you add the directory as a bookmark, it will appear in the \"Files\" icon as well when you right-click on it.\nI would not create another .desktop file (launcher) calling nautilus. Creating multiple .desktop files, calling the same application in their \"native\" command causes inconsistency in the way the application appears in the launcher. \n", "Q: How to change the keyboard shortcut to take screenshots with Shutter? I use Shutter for screenshots. When I press Print Screen or Shift + Ctrl + Z, a popup appears that a screenshot is going to be made in 2 seconds.

In the dialog that pops up, give a name so that you would be able to quickly recognize it later on and the command which you wish to run when the keyboard shortcut gets activated; and click Apply.\nI have put \"Snap with Shutter\" as Name and shutter -f as the Command. (shutter -f captures the full screen, for other available commands, refer to CAPTURE MODE OPTIONS given in man shutter.)\n\nThis would create an entry with the name you provided and shortcut as \"Disabled\" (since you haven't yet provided one to it). To bind a shortcut to it, click on the \"Disabled\" text and hit the shortcut keys you would wish to bind to it. It it succeeds, the key combination would be visible to you, otherwise it would ask you to provide an another one.\n\n", "Q: Installing Printer I tried installing the Epson printer driver from here.

I was hoping to be able to install the awesome Mint Menu in my Gnome Flashback session on Ubuntu 14.04.\nLooking around the web, it seemed this was possible, and my searching has led me to this repository, which claims to have ported the Mint Menu to Gnome. At least, as far as I understand it.\nHowever, it seems the repository stopped being maintained around Ubuntu version 11, three years ago. I tried adding the repository and installing Mint Menu anyway, hoping that just because it was old didn't mean it was necessarily unusable. However, it didn't install, giving me unresolvable package dependency issues, which I've learned to not try and solve myself.\nIs there no backwards compatibility between repositories? If someone stops maintaining a repository, is it basically dead and useless?\n\nA: \nIs there no backwards compatibility between repositories? \n\nYes, there is but to some extent. For Ubuntu versions you can use repositories through the versions that are not end of life but mixing releases is not recommended.\n1 problem you will run into is when there is a big change in the default software. Ubuntu went from Gnome to Unity so any tool depending on the old style will be buggy or completely useless. That probably includes that Mint Menu. \n\nIf someone stops maintaining a repository, is it basically dead and useless?\n\nUbuntu will move the default repositories to an archive so these are still usable to Ubuntu users. How others deal with this is up to them. Personal archives tend to be available on launchpad for all releases (even those end of life).\n", "Q: How to enable alternative log in sessions (e.g. Unity 2D or others) in Trusty?

Just note before you try that maybe read up a bit and even play with it in a virtual machine because it is not a very simple process to remove it completely again.

I was using 12.04 on my laptop but it was installed with wubi installer. I tried to search for a wubi with 14.04 but didn't find it. Can Is there a way to install 14.04 alongside Windows 7 on one HDD. I had and idea to to upgrade 12.04 to 14.04 but I don't know will this work. Any ideas ?\n\nA: You can upgrade from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS. Open Software Updater and let it check for all updates. When it is done, it should inform you that there is a new version of Ubuntu available, and give you an option to upgrade.\nIf not, check the Software & Updates under the Updates tab there is a dropdown list at the bottom for Notify Me Of New Ubuntu Versions; select Long Term Support versions and then exit the window. Restart Software Updater let it run again. You should now be informed of a new version which you may upgrade to.\n\nA: I met a lot of people that had some serious problem after upgrading to 14.04. So I recommend you to do a clean installation (after saving your data !) or to keep 12.04.\nHere is how I did a clean install (adapt for yourself) :\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded the ubuntu x64 iso (choose depending your CPU) (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)\n\n*I used lili usb creator from windows to make a bootable usb key. (http://www.linuxliveusb.com/)\nUSE 2.0 USB KEY AND PORT, 3.0 WONT WORK.\n\n*I started on the live usb (choose try ubuntu)\n\n*Using Gparted, I made these partitions (sda3 to sda7 are one ubuntu installation) :\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   524290047   262144000    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2       524290048  1500540927   488125440    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3      1500542974  1953523711   226490369    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5      1500542976  1668314460    83885742+  83  Linux\n/dev/sda6      1668317184  1701871615    16777216   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda7      1701873664  1953523711   125825024   83  Linux\n\n*I launched installation, choose other (custom installation)\n\n*I used sda5 as /, sda7 as /home.\n\n*You can guess how to end the installation. If you install windows afterwards, remember to use boot-repair.\n\n\nI recommend you to put your Ubuntu installation at the end of the disk.

I have one Dell UltraSharp U2713HM (27 inches, 2560x1440) and I was thinking about getting two more. Would it be possible to have those three working with Ubuntu (Kubuntu) on any graphics card out there today? What is the best option if it comes to choosing particular model? Should I use proprietary drivers or some open sourced ones?\nI am not a gamer. I mostly develop on my machines and running some computational tasks, but I would rather like to spend some more money and have setup where I don't see any lagging.\n\nA: For triple-monitor support you need to be aware that most non-DisplayPort graphics cards only support two simultaneous outputs, because they only have two PLLs, and hence can generate two pixel clocks. Since you are planning to use 3 DisplayPort monitors (Dell U2713HM) this should not be a problem, but if you change your mind and use non-DP monitors, it is an important constraint. If you have absolutely identical monitors (same internals, same frequency pixel clock) then some drivers will allow you to share a single pixel clock between two displays (the Intel driver will for sure, and I think AMD's open source driver will). For more details see Wikipedia Intel graphics and three active displays.\nYour options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel HD integrated graphics. Intel GPU comes with your CPU, and is well supported with open source drivers. The Intel drivers can share PLLs for triple-head on non-DP monitors. You will need a motherboard with three video outputs, or laptop with DisplayPort/Thunderbolt ports.\n\n*(for DVI/HDMI monitors) AMD Radeon with a Sapphire FleX card. Sapphire's FleX is a brand name for cards that have a third PLL, and so can support three simultaneous outputs. \n\n*(for DP monitors) AMD Radeon Eyefinity supports upto 6 monitors with the open source radeon driver. You can also use this card with non-DP monitors, but you will need active DP adaptors. For more details see Using six monitors with AMD's open-source driver. \n\n*Nvidia Surround with the closed source driver. According to the answers to the question Linux + “nVidia surround” + 3 monitors? this should work correctly with upto 4 monitors.\n\n*You do not necessarily need multiple video outputs if you have DisplayPort 1.2 monitors or a DisplayPort MST Hub. In this case, you can use a graphics card or laptop with a single DisplayPort output and connect it to multiple DP 1.2 monitors with \"daisy-chaining\", or connect it with a single cable to the DisplayPort MST Hub, and then connect the MST Hub to your monitors. This option is working but not quite ready yet - the patches are expected to appear in the Linux 3.16 kernel.\nIt should be a lot more common to see this option in the future, as it enables a laptop with single mini-DP connector to drive multiple monitors. (For space and cost reasons, laptops do not usually feature multiple DP ports). \n\nA: This is not even a question. ATI drivers for linux seriously lag behind in terms of non-standard setups. People say it all the time. \nThe real problem is if you should use one NVIDIA with three monitors or two on one and one on other. Of that, I can't help really. I did use 3 monitors on 1 NVIDIA, but they where 1080p only - I am not sure if DVI outputs og GTX7*** can hanle more.\n", "Q: Access to Ubuntu Server 12.04 offline How to login in Ubuntu Server when server is offline?

Then select \"try ubuntu\" and mount the server disk. From there you can try to troubleshoot any issues. Or alternatively you can make a backup of the machine and do a reinstallation (the system /home /etc and /var are most likely sufficient for a backup).\nIf there's something wrong with the network configuration have a look at /etc/network/interfaces. \nIf you do a reinstallation beware of any databases stored on the computer: Databases cannot be recovered by just copying the configuration folders (in most cases).\n", "Q: sound suddently stopped working for internal speakers, headphones still work I have had no problems with the audio on my Dell Inspiron 15 1700 since I had purchased it a month ago.

Apart from that it is a normal Ubuntu.\nWe are now trying to setup this installation procedure for 14.04.\nWe can successfully install with our configuration from network, but the first boot fails with the message that /tmp is not available. The machine does not respond to any key presses at that moment (so I cannot Skip or do Manual recovery). The boot process is also extremely slow (more than one minute until the message about /tmp is shown).\nI found a work around that helps. After installation, I need to boot into recovery mode once. In the recovery menu, I need to select network (which mounts partitions and configures network) and then resume. Now the system boots fine, and any subsequent boot (also without recovery mode) is fine, too. So no manual fixing done, just a some how \"special\" boot once.\nIf I skip the network step in the recovery menu and go straight to resume, it does not work. If I reboot immediately after the network step (without going to resume), it also does not work.\nI did it manually once and entered a root shell from the recovery menu, everything looked fine at that time (both before and after running the network steps).\nI diff'ed /etc and /var before and after running the network step, and there were no big differences (just DHCP leases and logs in /var as expected).\nNow my question is, what happens during this boot that is different from a normal boot?\nI guess, at the first boot there are some installation duties remaining, and these somehow do not work on a normal boot, but what could they be?\nMaybe the manual execution of the network step from recovery menu changes the order of some things, and that resolves the problem?\nCan I fix these problems at the end of installation prior to first boot (we run a script at that stage anyway) so that everything just works?\nHow can I debug these problems and provide more information for you to help?\nWhat file might change during boot and could be interesting?\nI can reproduce both the problem and the workaround, so I can provide as much info as needed.\nOur site-wide adjustments only affect LDAP authentication and NFS home directories, not the boot process or the partitioning. During installation a root partition (ext4) is created and a swap partition, no further partitions. This is a legacy boot (no UEFI).\nEdit: I debugged it a little bit further. After installation I need to do the following steps once to:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into recovery mode and start a root shell\n\n*run mountall\n\n*run ifup -a\nAfter that, everything works nicely.\nAll three steps take much more time than expected (around one minute each). After finishing, booting takes only a few seconds (machine has an SSD).\n\nA: After a careful examination of the differences between the /etc directories on a working and a broken system, I found the solution.\nThe problem is a missing nss_initgroups_ignoreusers line in /etc/ldap.conf. This line lists all local users, and prevents the system from accessing the LDAP directory when looking up these users. This line is created automatically on each boot by /usr/sbin/nssldap-update-ignoreusers, but with my installation method it was missing on the first boot. So during this first boot, the system was trying to lookup user information from LDAP before the network connection was brought up. Of course this failed.\nI now added a call to /usr/sbin/nssldap-update-ignoreusers to our script that runs between installation and first boot, and now everything works fine.\n", "Q: How do I add a windows 8 user to Linux standalone SAMBA server I would like to add a Windows 8 (Microsoft account) user to a SAMBA user on standalone (not domain) linux server, however I do not know how the Microsoft account maps to linux. I have also setup the samba shares based on group access.   \nI have guests enabled in SAMBA so when my Windows 8 workstation connected for the first time it did not recognise the user and connected to SAMBA as a guest with nobody as user. Now when I connect to the shares it always connects as guest (that is nobody user on SAMBA).\nI would like the guest users to still be allowed to connect as read only.\nIs there anyway to force Windows 8 to prompt for login again? Note that my shares are not mapped in explorer they are browsable.   \n\nA: I assume that you have a central windows server with central user profiles (active directory). To integrate these workstations you have to mount the user home directories into /home on your linux machines and hook up the active directory into linux. \nThe keywords that you want to search for are: ldap pam active directory integration.  Useful links: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Active Directory Howto\n\n*Debian LDAP/PAM\nnote that integrating a windows machine into linux/ldap is generally not recommended (unless you have lots and lots of spare time on your hands). It might work satisfactorily with Samba 4.0. I haven't tried since it provides its own ldap... \nEdit: I think I might have misunderstood you. If you want to access a linux samba share from windows simply follow the Ubuntu Samba Server Guide. If you want to login with as $user to the server simply create $user on the server. And set a samba password for the user:\nsmbpasswd -a $user\n\nthe configure the samba server according to your needs. Note: You don't need ldap/kerberos for this kind of setup. It usually helps to use your windows username and password as username/password for the linux user $user. In that case you won't need to configure any passwords on Windows. \n\nA: I haven't actually tried this but I might need it myself soon. Maybe this link could help you? For future reference I'll copy the proposed solution here as well.\nAdd a line in /etc/samba/smbusers of the form:\nlinux_name = windows_name1 windows_name2 <etc.>\n\ne.g.\na_user = a_user@hotmail.com\n\nThis maps Windows name(s) (i.e. your Microsoft account used to log on to Windows 8) to a linux name (i.e. an existing linux & samba account). You may also need to add this parameter to the [global] section of: /etc/samba/smb.conf.\nusername map = /etc/samba/smbusers\n\nTo test the configuration use the following command:\ntestparm -vs | grep \"username map\"\n\nLet me know if you got it to work!\n", "Q: Ralink MT7601U (148f:7601) Wi-Fi adapter installation I am trying to install a Ralink wifi adapter in Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.\nThe system is not detecting the wifi.\n\n\n*\n\n*lsusb lists the device as:\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 148f:7601 Ralink Technology, Corp.\n\n\n*I have the rt2800 USB driver listed in \"/etc/modules\";\n\n*Following some instructions on the web, I tried this command:\necho 148F 7601 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/rt2800usb/new_i\n\n\n*lsmod | grep rt2800 returns the following:\nrt2800usb              26581  0 \nrt2x00usb              20041  1 rt2800usb\nrt2800lib              83150  1 rt2800usb\nrt2x00lib              48886  3 rt2x00usb,rt2800lib,rt2800usb\nmac80211              545990  3 rt2x00lib,rt2x00usb,rt2800lib\ncrc_ccitt              12627  1 rt2800lib\n\n\nA: I suggest you get a temporary internet connection, ethernet, tethered or whatever is available.

Ubuntu uses Upstart as its init daemon. Upstart does handle runlevels and legacy init-style scripts for backwards compatibility, but most boot processes installed by Ubuntu itself are Upstart jobs. Upstart jobs do not start and stop on numbered runlevels like traditional init scripts do.\nHowever, on a Red Hat system, the primary difference between runlevel 3 (multi-user text mode) and runlevel 5 (graphical desktop login) is whether gdm is running.

After having upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 I used localhost, but with the given configuration I cannot print the test page. In certain cases the red signal lamp  on the printer turns on and I have to cancel the print job. \nWith hplip I do not have the possibility to put lpt1 and I stop there. \nAlso when I setup the printer in the administration interface I cannot print. It exits with a error warning and the pdf blocks my printer. \nBut I am hoping for your kind assistance.\n\nA: I have a LaserJet 3200 (similar to your 2100 for printing). I didn't install HPLIP because it looked like a big software which I didn't need because I use it only for printing.\nI tried many drivers (Footmatic, CUPS, Postscript, PCL5, PCL6) because the default one was having a pause between each page.

What would be the easiest way to run a command (in this case, a script that terminates running servers and sounds an alarm) when any USB device, including the drive it is running from, disconnects? Thanks!\n\nA: You have to make an udev rules. To do so, you must create a file like this :\n$ sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/.rules\nThe name can be whatever you want as long as it ends with .rules\nNow here is how you write a rule (it's one I use) :\nACTION==\"add\", ENV{ID_FS_UUID}==\"E040-9945\", RUN+=\"/bin/su adrien -c 'export DISPLAY=:0 && /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command -d'\"\nACTION==\"remove\", ENV{ID_FS_UUID}==\"E040-9945\", RUN+=\"/bin/su adrien -c 'export DISPLAY=:0 && /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command -l'\"\n\nFirst you must specify what conditions to trigger the rule. Here I use the action and the UUID of my usb key. Then I specify a script to run (This one lock/unlock my screen). (You can put as many RUN+=\"\" as you need.)\nIn your case, don't put the UUID condition but rather something like DRIVERS==\"usb-storage\"\nTo find out what property to check, plug an usb key, let's say it goes to /dev/sdb and run :\n$ udevadm info -a -p /sys/block/sdb | grep usb\n\n", "Q: PHP Memcache Extension Incomplete on Ubuntu 12.04 The issue is this. I have several servers all running the php5-memcache extension on Ubuntu 12.04.

The class doe have get, put, add, delete and I think extendedStats or something like that.

This should install it and remove the confusingly awful php5-memcache:\nsudo apt-get install php5-memcached php5-memcache-\n\n\nA: You need to install PHP Memcache Extension and configure it.\nsudo apt-get install memcached php-pear build-essential\n\nAfter that, run sudo pecl install memcache to install memcache\nOnce you have completed the installation of memcache with PECL, add memcached to memcache.ini:\necho \"extension=memcache.so\" | sudo tee /etc/php5/conf.d/memcache.ini\n\nFinally reload apache\n/etc/init.d/apache2 reload\n\nAnd now you're ready to start using memcache.\n", "Q: fixing grub after removing linux I had installed Ubuntu on a friend's computer.

Is there a way to open the three of them entering the password only once?\nThanks.\n\nA: The encryption password used by Vim for encrypting and decrypting files is stored in the key variable, see :help encryption. This variable is normally local to a Vim buffer, so Vim uses a unique password for each encrypted file that is opened or saved. Vim will prompt for a new password when a different encrypted file is opened for the first time.\nTo make the password global, enter\n:set key=asdf\n\nin Vim, where asdf is the password. After explicitly giving the key variable a value like this, Vim will use the same password for subsequent encrypted files that are opened with :e or :n in the same Vim instance.\nThe key variable can be set on the Vim command line used to open the files with\nvim --cmd \"set key=asdf\" a.txt b.txt c.txt\n\nBeware: this records the password in the clear to your shell history file (for example ~/.bash_history) and to all other users on the system by simply looking at a list of running processes with ps.\nOther solutions for encrypting files transparently with Vim are possible, the Vim wiki offers this page of tips on encryption, including executing PGP or GnuPG automatically when opening and saving files based on the file extension.\n\nA: Type in the key before opening the first file with this cmd:\nvim -c \":let &key=inputsecret('key=')|:bdel dummy\" dummy a.txt b.txt c.txt \n\nEdit 1. To answer question in the comment below. If you want the files open together in tabs, like vim -p a.txt b.txt c.txt\n vim -c \":let &key=inputsecret('key=')|:tab all|:bdel dummy\" dummy a.txt b.txt c.txt \n\nMore options: set viminfo= noswapfile bin cm=blowfish \nNeeds a dummy file dummy, because the input dialog comes up only after the first file is loaded, even with --cmd. In this case, you have to type the key once. \nDon't use *--cmd=\"set key=asfd\"*; because process args can be seen with the ps command to others users, may get logged in syslog, and also saved in your bash_history.\n", "Q: manually installung Grub2 after Windows8.1 update 1 After boot-repair failed to install (both with secure boot disabled and enabled), I decided to try running grub-install manually using the following command.\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/root/ --efi-directory=/boot --uefi-secure-boot /dev/sda7\nWhere /dev/sda7 is the root for the Ubuntu install. however, this prints Installing for i386-pc platform., and I'm on a 64 bit machine.

So, the package gnome is actually a shortcut for installing all sorts of goodies:\n\naisleriot, alacarte, avahi-daemon, cheese, cups-pk-helper, desktop-base, evolution, evolution-plugins, file-roller, gedit, gedit-plugins, gimp, gnome-applets, gnome-color-manager, gnome-core, gnome-documents, gnome-games, gnome-media, gnome-nettool, gnome-orca, gnome-shell-extensions, gnome-tweak-tool, gstreamer1.0-libav, gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly, hamster-applet, inkscape, libgtk2-perl, libreoffice-calc, libreoffice-gnome, libreoffice-impress, libreoffice-writer, nautilus-sendto, network-manager-gnome, rhythmbox, rhythmbox-plugin-cdrecorder, rhythmbox-plugins, rygel-playbin, rygel-preferences, rygel-tracker, seahorse, shotwell, simple-scan, sound-juicer, telepathy-gabble, telepathy-rakia, telepathy-salut, tomboy, totem, totem-plugins, tracker-gui, transmission-gtk, vinagre, xdg-user-dirs-gtk, browser-plugin-gnash, gdebi, nautilus-sendto-empathy, telepathy-idle, dia-gnome, gnome-boxes, gnucash, libreoffice-evolution, planner\n\nThis is the full Gnome desktop and is not needed to run the Gnome desktop environment. So, while you have gnome-shell installed, you don't have all the associated applications like games and email client etc that come with the full desktop environment. \nThis is not a problem and it does not hinder you from using Gnome in any way. \ngnome-core is also a meta package, it will install the official \"core\" modules of the Gnome desktop:\n\nat-spi2-core, baobab, brasero, caribou, caribou-antler, dconf-gsettings-backend, dconf-tools, empathy, eog, evince, evolution-data-server, firefox, or, fonts-cantarell, gconf2, gdm, gkbd-capplet, glib-networking, gnome-backgrounds, gnome-bluetooth, gnome-calculator, gnome-contacts, gnome-control-center, gnome-dictionary, gnome-disk-utility, gnome-font-viewer, gnome-icon-theme, gnome-icon-theme-extras, gnome-icon-theme-symbolic, gnome-keyring, gnome-menus, gnome-online-accounts, gnome-packagekit, gnome-panel, gnome-power-manager, gnome-screensaver, gnome-screenshot, gnome-session, gnome-settings-daemon, gnome-shell, gnome-sushi, gnome-system-log, gnome-system-monitor, gnome-terminal, gnome-themes-standard, gnome-user-guide, gnome-user-share, gsettings-desktop-schemas, gstreamer1.0-plugins-base, gstreamer1.0-plugins-good, gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio, gtk2-engines, gucharmap, gvfs-backends, gvfs-bin, libatk-adaptor, libcanberra-pulse, libcaribou-gtk-module, libcaribou-gtk3-module, libgtk-3-common, libpam-gnome-keyring, metacity, mousetweaks, nautilus, notification-daemon, pulseaudio, sound-theme-freedesktop, tracker-gui, vino, yelp, zenity, network-manager-gnome, gnome, \n\nNote that the gnome metapackage also installs the gnome-core metapackage. In any case, the main point here is that metapackages are not needed. You can install each of their component packages manually so lacking one or more metapackages does not imply that anything is actually missing from your system. \n", "Q: difference between sources.list and sources.list.distUpgrade On ubuntu, in the /etc/apt/, there are two files: sources.list and sources.list.distUpgrade. But I only know they are used to update system. However, what are the the difference between them? by the way, what the GPG keys used for? when I update the sources.list using ubuntu source list generator, should I update GPG keys as well? \nThanks !\n\nA: When you upgrade between distro versions, .list files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d get commented out. The original versions of those files get backed up with the .distUpgrade extension, and that's what you're seeing. Other than sitting there and being backups, I don't think the .distUpgrade files do anything.\nI guess Ubuntu (Debian?) does this out of the presumption that .list files will be incompatible across distro versions, but as a packager, this is pretty inconvenient. Packages like google-chrome install a special cronjob just to work around this issue and un-comment-out their .list file after a dist upgrade.\n\nA: type man apt-get in terminal\n upgrade\n       upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages\n       currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in\n       /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new\n       versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no\n       circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages\n       not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of\n       currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without\n       changing the install status of another package will be left at\n       their current version. An update must be performed first so that\n       apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.\n\n   dist-upgrade\n       dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,\n       also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions\n       of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and\n       it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the\n       expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade\n       command may therefore remove some packages. The\n       /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which\n       to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for\n       a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual\n       packages.\n\n", "Q: How to remove element from gsettings array in script? Array in dbus/gsettings has a format [element1, element2, element3, ...]. \nGsettings' interface allows only replacing existing array with another, so for instance, adding another item element can be achieved as follows:\n#!/bin/bash\ngsettings get ${schema} ${key} | grep -q \\\"${value}\\\" >/dev/null\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n   gsettings set ${schema} ${key} \\\"`gsettings get ${schema} ${key} | sed s/.$//`, ${value}]\\\"\nfi\n\nCan anyone help me with a script, that checks whether at least one element exists that matches the regex, and if it does, it parses the gsettingsarray string, and removes all matching elements (and puts it back withgsettings set`, but that is trivial). \nI tried to find such tool, but I failed to find one. I cannot believe, that nobody yet had a need for such tool...\n\nThe question complements How to add element to the gsettings array at the specific location (given by index)?\n\nA: Using bash for this task should be possible but I prefer doing complex array manipulations with a Python3 script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport argparse\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add_argument(\"schema\", help=\"gsettings shema\", metavar=\"SCHEMA\")\nparser.add_argument(\"key\", help=\"gsettings key\", metavar=\"KEY\")\nparser.add_argument(\"values\",\n                    help=\"gsettings value(s) to remove from the KEY array\",\n                    metavar=\"VALUE\", nargs='*')\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\narray = eval(subprocess.check_output([\"gsettings\", \"get\", args.schema, args.key]))\nfor v in args.values:\n    try:\n        value = eval(v)\n    except:\n        value = v\n    try:\n        array.remove(value)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Warning: {} not in {} {}\".format(value, args.schema, args.key), file=sys.stderr)\nsubprocess.call([\"gsettings\", \"set\", args.schema, args.key, str(array)])\n\nThis script allow multiple values to be removed at the same time from the schema/key  passed to the script.\n", "Q: My password can log me in, but nothing else (\"user is not in the sudoers file\" error when I try) I recently got a new user account for Ubuntu 12.04 on Linux after becoming unable to log in to one of my earlier accounts. I can log in to this account easily enough, but when I try to use the password to install software through the Ubuntu Software Center, it reads:\nYour authentication attempt was unsuccessful. Please try again.\n\nI tried installing the software through the terminal with this:\nsudo apt-get install\n\nBut when I entered my password, I got this message:\n[username] is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.\n\nI searched here for a solution, and I found the answer here, which told me to open a root terminal. I don't know how to do this, but I found out I could get a root terminal by entering this in a normal terminal:\nsudo -i\n\nUpon doing this, I was asked to enter my sudo password, and I got the same message as before. What am I missing or doing wrong?\n\nA: You can boot into recovery mode, start a root shell from there and add your user account to the sudo group with adduser USERNAME sudo. \nAnother solution is, once you are in the root shell, to edit the sudoers file as the thread you linked suggests.\nSee Broke my sudoers password, how do I reset it without using sudo? for details.\n\nA: It looks like you are not allowed to execute commands as root user. Be sure your user account is in the group sudo (type id or grep $USER /etc/group to find out). \nIf it is not, you have to get it in there. Try to launch your system in recovery mode, you should be able to access a single user root shell from there. Then you can type adduser your_username sudo. This should fix the problem.\n\nA: Log in as either root or a user that does have sudo access, then type: visudo and add the user you're having trouble with to the sudoers file.\n", "Q: Cannot get flash video websites (YouTube, etc.) to work I know that other, multiple questions have been posted on this, but I'm fairly certain I've applied most, if not all, of the suggested solutions, and I'm no closer to resolving this issue.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 (Black Opal, 32-bit system, Firefox web browser), and I cannot use any website that provides flash video (e.g., YouTube).  The page loads, but the typical black box with the \"play\" icon does not load...that area is completely white/blank.  This is true of all other Flash sites.\nI made sure I have the ubuntu-restricted-extras package installed, and I even tried installing the flashplugin-installer ... in fact, according to Synaptic Package Manager, I have that AND flashplugin-downloader installed.  Interestingly, I also have adobe-flashplugin version 11.2.202.350, which would seem to be correct (I know that support for Flash in Linux ended with 11.2) and both adobe-flash-properties-gtk and -kde (whatever those are).  Also, it appears that none of the previous Firefox helper-extensions for flash in Linux are available any longer.  I have no idea where to go from here, and being able to see flash websites is occasionally a necessity for me.  \nAs an interesting related note: Google Chrome/Chromium (I can't remember which) was installed as part of my Ubuntu system install, and I seem to remember it working...until I installed the flashplugin-installer to try and fix my problems with flash...now, Chrome doesn't even load!  Double-clicking on the icon produces no response.  Looking in the system monitor, I can see instances of Google Chrome are invoked when I double-click the icon, but there is no visible effect (no browser window, etc.)\nRunning Google Chrome from terminal shows: \n[0428/183027:ERROR:nacl_helper_linux.cc(236)] NaCl helper process running without a sandbox! Most likely you need to configure your SUID sandbox correctly.\n\nAt the same time, I got a popup window that told me System Problem has been detected (or something to that effect) and asked if I wanted to report it, etc, etc. \nWhat did I do wrong, or what am I missing?  Thanks in advance!\n\nA: The last Flash version provided by Ubuntu repos is 11.2.\nTo get latest Flash version 13, the easiest way is hrough Google Chrome browser.\nUnfortunately the Pepper Flash Plugin of Chrome doesn't work with the default Ubuntu browser, Firefox.\nYou should reinstall Google Chrome:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall google-chrome\n\nYou may uninstall the old flashplugin-installer because it is obsolete.\nsudo apt-get purge flashplugin-installer\n\n\nA: Only this plugin did the trick !\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Chromium/Getting-Flash\n", "Q: \"Not downloading file in useable form\" error when trying to make a Live USB stick on a Mac I have downloaded ubuntu onto my Mac but when I click on the file I get message that The Following Disk images couldn't be opened..

At first it was set to internet sync, I chose my country, but apperantly the time there is wrong because it was 3 hours back. \nI also tried to set it to sync manually to close countries that use the same time zone, they are all 3 hours back from what they should be. [GMT instead of GMT+3]\nI then changed it manually from the time and date settings and locked it, that works but only until the computer is restarted, and then it goes 3 hours back on it's own >.>\nEdit: Yes I am dual booting with Windows\n\nA: By default Windows uses local time in the bios for eh, reasons. Most other operating systems use UTC, and display as the appropriate local time.\nClearly you need to change one to match the other.\nTo change Lubuntu: (note for readers in the future, this is reasonably likely to change soon to match some other distros, don't downvote me in a years time!):\nsudo gedit /etc/default/rcS\nThis opens a file with a bunch of system variables. Find the line that says UTC=yes and change it to say UTC=no. Save. Reboot.\nTo change Windows:\nRun regedit. Navigate to the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TimeZoneInformation. If there's a value called RealTimeIsUniversal (value 0) change it to 1. If not, create a new DWORD value called RealTimeIsUniversal and set the value to 1. Reboot.\nTo decide which to change:\nThe pros for going UTC (the Linux/Unix/OSX/Android/iOS/nearly everything else way) are that it makes more sense generally, not least because UTC doesn't change about like local times can, and there are lots of little bugs that can be caused by using local time in the background.\nThe pros for going for local time (the Windows way) is that MS don't support the registry setting described above.\nIf you're mostly a Windows user and are just trying Lubuntu or have a few things you like it for, or Lubuntu is for enjoying computers while Windows is for the stuff you earn your bread with, then I'd recommend keeping Windows as it is, and changing Linux to match.\nOtherwise, I'd recommend changing Windows to work the Linux way.\n", "Q: How can I lock the screen using the new lockscreen from the command line? Ubuntu 14.04 introduces a new lockscreen that looks similar to the login screen.\n\nI am still able to lock the screen using the command gnome-screensaver-command --lock (as I always did before), which under 14.04 does lock the screen, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are running it from the desktop, it locks the screen using the new lockscreen.\n\n*If you are running it from a virtual console or via SSH, it locks the screen using the old lockscreen.\n\n\nI've also tried using xdg-screensaver lock, but it works in the same way as gnome-screensaver-command --lock does (only uses the new lockscreen when it's ran from the desktop).\nRunning light-locker-command --lock didn't work, as light-locker is not installed.\nI guess there must be some differences between running the same command from the desktop and running it via SSH/virtual console, but I was not able to find any difference in the environment variables.\nSo, my question is: How can I lock the screen using the new Unity lockscreen and not the old lockscreen from the command line?\nThis question is probably related as it asks for the new command that needs to be used, so here's another question: Why does running the same lock command give different results?\nNote that gnome-screensaver is not being used anymore in 14.04, according to this bug report:\n\nThat's not really a gnome-screensaver bug, that component stopped being used in trusty.\n\n\nA: I recently found out that\nxdg-screensaver lock\nworks aswell and is quite a simple solution too!\n\nA: The accepted answer has the right idea, except that the lockscreen is related to unity panel, while  org.gnome.ScreenSaver is obviously a Gnome-related type of schema,so it may or may not work. \nThere exists however a dbus interface for Unity, and all we need is to call this method com.canonical.Unity.Session.Lock like so\nqdbus com.canonical.Unity  /com/canonical/Unity/Session com.canonical.Unity.Session.Lock\n\nSide note:\nThe proof of the fact that it's related to unity panel is simple, when you have the screen locked, the process /usr/lib/unity/unity-panel-service will change to /usr/lib/unity/unity-panel-service --lock-mode as observed from tty1.\n\nA: You can always send the keystrokes: xdotool key super+l.\n\nA: I don't have gnome-screensaver installed, and the only command I can find that works is this:\ndbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver /org/gnome/ScreenSaver org.gnome.ScreenSaver.Lock\n\n\n", "Q: Bash command chaining I'd like to run chained commands but some are sequential and others are in background.\nRunning this command:\necho 1 && echo 2 & echo 3 && echo 4\n\nI'd like to get:\n1\n2 (background)\n3\n4\n\nBut I get:\n3\n4\n1\n2\n\nA more realistic example:\ncompile &&\nrun server &  (background, used by tests below)\nrun test 1 &&\nrun test 2 &&\nkill server\n\nHow can I do it using bash?\nThanks!\n\nA: I think that what you are asking for is:\necho 1 && { echo 2 & } && echo 3 && echo 4\n\nIn the above echo 1 runs in foreground but echo 2 runs background.\nNote that the && after echo 2 may not be doing what you think.

This is because the return code for the background process is not available when the decision to start echo 3 is made.\nLet's consider your more realistic example:\ncompile && { run server & } && run test 1 && run test 2 && kill server\n\nrun test 1 will start regardless of whether run server succeeded or failed.  Worse than that, run test 1 may start before run server has finished setting up the server.  A quick fix is to delay run test 1 by enough time that you are confident that run server has finished doing its setup:\ncompile && { run server & } && sleep 1 && run test 1 && run test 2 && kill server\n\nAlternatively, you would need to know something about run server so that you can test its successful setup.\nBackground\n\n\n*\n\n*The braces, {...}, create a list.  Thus the construct { echo 2 & } allows us to run echo 2 with the effect of the operator & confined to just the commands in the list.\n\n*&& is bash's logical and.

When I try to mount Windows 8.1 NTFS Partition it is showing this error message as below. Previously I was using Windows 7, but I have no problem to mount that partition. I tried to follow this answer and do as follows with Windows 8.1\nSolution: Windows 8\nThere is a new feature in Windows 8 called Fast Startup. If this feature is enabled (which it is by default), Windows 8 does not actually completely shutdown when you choose \"shutdown\". Instead, it does a \"hybrid shutdown\". This is something like hibernating; it makes booting Windows 8 back up faster. So, you need to disable this feature to be able to shut it down properly, and be able to mount the Windows partitions. To do this, boot into your Windows 8 and:\nNote: disabling Fast Startup will most likely make your Windows 8 take a longer time to boot. There are no \"exact\" numbers, but let's say that if it took you 10 seconds to boot into Windows 8, it will now take you 50 seconds after disabling this feature.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Control Panel in the small icons view and click on Power Options.\n\n*Click on Choose what the power buttons do.\n\n*Click on Change settings that are currently unavailable.\n\n*Uncheck Turn on fast startup (recommended).\n\n\nClick on Save changes. Now, shutdown Windows 8 and boot back into Ubuntu. You'll be able to mount without getting errors.\nBut I can not mount Windows 8.1 partition even after I done this. Can anyone help me, please! The error message is \n  Error mounting /dev/sda2 at /media/rashed/Windows 8.1: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda2\" \"/media/rashed/Windows 8.1\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: Windows is hibernated, refused to mount.\n    Failed to mount '/dev/sda2': Operation not permitted\n    The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown\n    Windows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\n    read-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\n\nA: The procedure of disabling the fast startup will stop win from storing metadata on all of the accessible hard-disks, but it doesn't get deleted right-away. \nYou need to run \nntfsfix /dev/sdXY\n\nwhere X is the volume letter e.g. b, if it's the secondary hard-disk and Y is the partition number e.g. 2 if it's the second partition. \nThat should make you able to mount it just fine.\n\nA: If you're able to boot to the Windows login screen, you should be able to get around this by clicking the power menu in the lower right, holding down the Shift key, and clicking Shut Down.  Just hold down shift until the machine fully powers off.\nThis should force a \"full shutdown\" from Windows, without requiring any login password.  You should then be able to mount the Windows volume from your Linux instance without any errors.\n\nA: I solved this problem by running  powercfg /h off in windows command terminal. This command usually disable windows hibernate permanently. I follow this instruction and now I have full access of windows partition.\n\nA: have you tryed to install ntfs-3g to access the ntfs partition. also I think since windows still did a fast Startup i would try to do a reboot on windows to windows and try again ... and i think that a cache clean up might fix it.\n\nA: By changing the permission in Windows 8 you can fix this problem. I have faced same problem as you faced. It is solved after providing the full access to the all user. I do not have any idea to the other consequences in Windows by doing this.  \n", "Q: How To Get List Of Files From Audio CD Bash Terminal I've been using VLC with command line batch files for years to rip audio cds.\nI just tried writing a similar bash script in Ubuntu 14.04 and was surprised--I can't figure out how to get a list of file names on the CD to pass to VLC Media Player to convert. I need something like:\nFILES=/path/to/*.cda\nfor f in $FILES\ndo\n   echo \"Processing $f file...\"\n   # take action on each file. $f store current file name\n   call_my_vlc_function( $f)\ndone\n\nIs there a 'trick' to getting a list of files on an audio cd in Ubuntu for use in a bash script or is this just not possible? I've already read a number of articles on how the gvfs system is different from a 'real' file system, but I'm just amazed that there is something Windows can do so trivially which can't be done in bash.\nTIA,\n---JC\n\nA: I guess I would second using ripit.  However, it is just a wrapper around some other CD utilities, such as cdparanoia and cdda2wav.  It seems to me that it would just be easier to rip the entire CD into the file format you need (OGG, WAV, MP3...).\nHowever, if you must use VLC, then I suspect all you really need is the track information, and cdda2wav can do that, but other than the number of tracks, I'm confused as to what you are looking for specifically.  Anyhow, if you want to do that to get the number of tracks, you could then pass in the parameter to VLC such as:\nvlc cdda//sr0 --cdda-track 1\n\nMore about ripit, check out the README just off of http://www.suwald.com/ripit/use.php \nIf you go low-level with cdda2wav or its companions, you may have difficulty with the version that coms with Ubuntu, so you might want to read up on it and download the other version from http://cdrecord.org.\nIf none of this helps, then all I can say is that more input is needed.\n\nA: You're probably getting names like \"Audio File 1\" \"Audio File 2\" etc in Windows. These aren't real files, they're made up by Windows. Either use a GUI file browser with this support like Nautilus, or else use ripit, crip, yaret or some other script to rip.\n", "Q: How are packages maintained in Ubuntu Lets say I copy a .deb package to /tmp directory and install it (dpkg -i).\nAfter a reboot should this package get loaded automatically ?

I've looked at the relevant configuration files, and have not been able to identify the problem.  I haven't tried to reboot since seeing this message, because I do not want to \"just see what happens\" on a server I can't physically access (and possibly make diagnosis even more difficult, if I lose access to a running system that I can probe for information.)  I feel that I should try to understand the error message and system configuration, until I have confidence that a reboot is likely to succeed.\nFirst, the error message (from update-initramfs -u):\nW: mdadm: the array /dev/md3 with UUID dffcb503:bc157198:3fb6082e:e5593158\nW: mdadm: is currently active, but it is not listed in mdadm.conf. if\nW: mdadm: it is needed for boot, then YOUR SYSTEM IS NOW UNBOOTABLE!\nW: mdadm: please inspect the output of /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf, compare\nW: mdadm: it to /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf, and make the necessary changes.\nW: mdadm: the array /dev/md1 with UUID a46d442b:4e5b8a52:3fb6082e:e5593158\nW: mdadm: is currently active, but it is not listed in mdadm.conf. if\nW: mdadm: it is needed for boot, then YOUR SYSTEM IS NOW UNBOOTABLE!\nW: mdadm: please inspect the output of /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf, compare\nW: mdadm: it to /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf, and make the necessary changes.\n\nI concentrate below on md1 since that's where /boot is located (so \"needed for boot\" === TRUE), but the same error message is also generated for md3.\nThe md structure is from the ISP's default Ubuntu image, this part of the system has not been touched.

Going back to the \"update-initramfs -u\" error message, it suggests comparing mdadm.conf to the output of /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf.  This is where we start to see something that looks really different:\n/usr/share/mdadm/mkconf\n# mdadm.conf\n#\n# Please refer to mdadm.conf(5) for information about this file.\n#\n\n# by default (built-in), scan all partitions (/proc/partitions) and all\n# containers for MD superblocks. alternatively, specify devices to scan, using\n# wildcards if desired.\n#DEVICE partitions\n\n# auto-create devices with Debian standard permissions\nCREATE owner=root group=disk mode=0660 auto=yes\n\n# automatically tag new arrays as belonging to the local system\nHOMEHOST <system>\n\n# instruct the monitoring daemon where to send mail alerts\nMAILADDR root\n\n# definitions of existing MD arrays\n\n\nIf I'm reading this correctly, the system's proposed rewrite of mdadm.conf (to fix that md1 and md3 are \"currently active, but ... not listed in mdadm.conf\") would DROP the listing of md1 and md3 from mdadm.conf.  So I can't square the error message and the proposed fix (change mdadm.conf to go from unlisted to listed, but where the proposed fix goes from listed to unlisted?)  My inability to (1) find any actual problem, and (2) reconcile the error message with the proposed fix, makes me distrust the output of /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf (and the error message directing me there, from update-initramfs -u).  But I don't want to ignore the system calling for help, especially on a part of the system that is so critical.  I trust that the OS knows something that I don't.  And experimentation (remote reboot) is a last resort.\nWhen searching online for others having similar error messages, related issues seem to involve mkconf generating ARRAY lines that are different from what is presently in mdadm.conf (and using mkconf's output is generally recommended, as a fix to the ARRAY lines.)  But in this case, mkconf provides no ARRAY lines at all, so this line of research has not led to relevant assistance.  Comments in mdadm.conf say that it scans for MD superblocks by defualt, so the fact that the generated file omits explicit reference to md1/md3 is perhaps okay (?) if mdadm can draw that information from the superblocks.  But if so, why does the error message say that the problem is that md1/md3 is unlisted, and what is wrong with the present configuration (why is there an error message at all)?  So that line of thought (trying to understand how a generated file without ARRAY lies might help) has not worked out either.\nThis is perhaps barking up the wrong tree, but are device names like sda1 currently allowed in mdadm.conf on ARRAY lines?  I know that UUID is preferred, could the use of device names be the cause of the error message?  If so, what options might work out:  (1) no change to mdadm.conf and relying on the system continuing to assemble md1 based on device names; (2) use the output of mkconf, with no explicit md's at all (no device name, no UUID's), relying on automatic discovery based on superblocks; (3) find the UUID's and write new ARRAY lines for mdadm.conf (which would be neither existing values, nor the mkconf proposed replacement)?\nHow should the cause of this error message be identified, what is it trying to tell me?\nAdditional information that might be useful:\nmdadm --misc --detail /dev/md1\n/dev/md1:\n        Version : 0.90\n  Creation Time : Sun Feb 24 19:11:59 2013\n     Raid Level : raid1\n     Array Size : 4194240 (4.00 GiB 4.29 GB)\n  Used Dev Size : 4194240 (4.00 GiB 4.29 GB)\n   Raid Devices : 2\n  Total Devices : 2\nPreferred Minor : 1\n    Persistence : Superblock is persistent\n\n    Update Time : Sun Apr 27 23:39:38 2014\n          State : clean\n Active Devices : 2\nWorking Devices : 2\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 0\n\n           UUID : a46d442b:4e5b8a52:3fb6082e:e5593158\n         Events : 0.122\n\n    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n       0       8        1        0      active sync   /dev/sda1\n       1       8       17        1      active sync   /dev/sdb1\n\n\nmdadm --misc --detail /dev/md3\n/dev/md3:\n        Version : 0.90\n  Creation Time : Sun Feb 24 19:11:59 2013\n     Raid Level : raid1\n     Array Size : 1458846016 (1391.26 GiB 1493.86 GB)\n  Used Dev Size : 1458846016 (1391.26 GiB 1493.86 GB)\n   Raid Devices : 2\n  Total Devices : 2\nPreferred Minor : 3\n    Persistence : Superblock is persistent\n\n    Update Time : Sun Apr 27 23:43:41 2014\n          State : clean\n Active Devices : 2\nWorking Devices : 2\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 0\n\n           UUID : dffcb503:bc157198:3fb6082e:e5593158\n         Events : 0.1883\n\n    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n       0       8       19        0      active sync   /dev/sdb3\n       1       8        3        1      active sync   /dev/sda3\n\n\n\nA: I found a solution here:\nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/forums/showthread.php?t=65066\nObtain the UUID for your array in question with the command: mdadm --misc --detail /dev/mdX (where X is the array number) and edit /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf and replace them with:\nARRAY /dev/md1 UUID=dffcb503:bc157198:3fb6082e:e5593158\nARRAY /dev/md3 UUID=a46d442b:4e5b8a52:3fb6082e:e5593158\n\nReplacing my /dev/mdX device and UUID with yours.

It doesn't seem to happen if I just open a youtube video and let it play, not touching ANYTHING else. But if I maximize and minimize a couple times it starts up (or if I am doing anything else on the comp e.g. chatting on steam). \nI am new to Linux and I am using my SteelSeries Siberia v2 USB headset which has it's own usb sound card 7.1 simulator thing. More info here:\nhttp://steelseries.com/us/products/audio/steelseries-siberia-v2-usb\nI tried editing pulse settings but I can't seem to get permission to do that. And I looked up how to just delete pulse and ended up deleting a bunch of stuff I shouldn't have and then had 0 sound and no system settings...I reinstalled everything is back to where it was. \nIs there a workaround for this?\n\nA: I had horrible clicking/popping sounds from my Logitech G35 USB headset. It worked fine on windows but not Fedora. There would be a painful sharp crack every now and again when music was playing, and every time I'd seek to a new spot in a track or on youtube.\nThe following additions to /etc/pulse/daemon.conf seems to have improved things, although I've only tested for about an hour. These options increase audio delays/buffer sizes, and reduces the sampling rate. It's pretty severe, so if it works start playing with the numbers to find a balance. Not sure which option is the main suspect yet.\nresample-method = src-sinc-best-quality\ndefault-sample-format = float32ne\nenable-remixing = yes\ndefault-sample-rate = 16000\ndeferred-volume-safety-margin-usec = 16000\ndefault-fragments = 8\ndefault-fragment-size-msec = 60\nnice-level = -15\n\nAfter saving, run pulseaudio --kill, pulseaudio --check and pulseaudio --start if no errors.\nUpdate: Pretty sure the 16khz sampling frequency essentially removes the crackles with a low-pass filter. Ugly quality, but better than aching ears.\n\nA: This sounds similar to a known bug and does not look to be fixed any time soon.\nI have a similar problem with a USB DAC adapter.\nThere is a bug raised at launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1136110) but the only recommendation so far is to attach the device to a separate PCI USB2 device, not USB3, however even this is not guaranteed.\nI have just ordered such a card from eBay and will hopefully see if it helps me soon.\n\nA: I'm not an expert, but I solved my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Going to the Ubuntu software center\n\n*Dwnloading  Pulse Audio Volume Control app\n\n*Setting my Internal Audio profile to Stereo Analog Output rather than Analog Stereo Duplex.\n\n\nA: If you wanted to get permissions, it's very simple to become the root user.

That situation already lasted for 6 months I was paying attention to troubled nvidia proprietary drivers in sli configuration...\nI was seriously pissed off on nvidia, unity and I was about to go for something non-unity related just go get smooth environment...\nThen I discovered less then hour before I killed ubuntu/unity...\nIt is something related to intel_pstate...\nI simply noticed, upon login performances are fantastics... Both cpu and gpu... Like a dream... Then after cca 10 seconds they drop and situation becomes ugly...

The session I'm having this one while writing this post is somewhat different...

On my system, idle injection starts only when things get hot. The OS protects the hardware from overheating.\nSee intel_powerclamp manual. It has \"Usage and Interfaces\" section which describes how to control it.\nTL;DR sudo rmmod intel_powerclamp, but you've been warned.\nMore gentle means to control the thing exist.\nFirst, locate the abstract \"thermal device\" corresponding to the power consumption control loop:\n# grep -l intel_powerclamp /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device*/type\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device11/type\n\n# cd /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device11\n\nNow, the \"slowdown\" percentage of the control loop can be adjusted:\n# echo 25 > cur_state\n\nIt's possible to set 0 there.

I recently upgraded from Juju 1.18 to 1.18.1, and suddenly my charm to deploy a MapR hadoop cluster stopped working.  I traced the problem to the fact that non-root disks are no longer associated with the instances, even though the constraints to the juju-deploy option have not changed.\nAs far as I can tell, there is not yet a juju constraint that defines non-boot storage.  The documentation for the root-disk constraint specifically notes \"Additional storage that may be attached separately does not count towards this value.\"\nTwo questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*What changed ?   The default m1.xlarge instances have 1 or 2 ephemeral disks when \n  I create them within the basic ec2 commands ... but not when Juju creates them\n\n*What is the Juju-supported mechanism for defining additional storage volumes.\n\n\nA: This appears to be the issue.\n\n\"For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.\"\n\nSo, if you were switched to m3 instances from m1 instances by the pricing drop, you may well no longer be getting instance store when our images previously included it: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#Using_AddingDefaultLocalInstanceStorageToAMI\nHere are some workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Juju 1.20 you will specifically be able to specify m1.xlarge so that Juju doesn't try to be smarter than you (and fail) at giving you the proper instance. We have this in 1.19, however that is the unstable release and might bring some other regressions.\n\n*The second option, the one recommended by the Juju Core team, is that you specify the constraints to be more specific so that you get an m1.xlarge. In order to this, we need to find out what specific constraints you are using so that we can determine what to add to your constraints so that you get an m1.xlarge and only an m1.xlarge. \n\n\nAs far as to what Juju-supported mechanism for defining additional storage volumes:\nWe currently do not handle additional storage volumes, but is very much on the roadmap for this cycle. However there are many use cases for how to do storage volumes and we would like to know how you'd like to see this supported, so if you can post your requirements to the Juju mailing list you can help shape how the feature will be specced out.\nRelated bugs:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1280852\n", "Q: Strange colors in Ubuntu (green tint, 14.04 LTS) I have a Dell Inspiron 17R 5737 with an Intel Haswell Core i5 4200U, and an AMD Radeon HD8870 graphics card (switchable).\nWhen installing Ubuntu (after checking disk for errors) and choosing \"Try without installing\", there's a green tint on the whole screen (where it's supposed to be pink/purple).

How do I get started?  I have Windows xp, and would like to run Ubuntu as well. I have downloaded Ubuntu to a memory stick, to a DVD-RW, and to 'Programs' on 'My Computer'.  It downloads to 'My Computer' as \"pagefiles.sys'.  When I try to open from any source, I get the message:\nThis file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action.\nCrate an association in Folder Options control panel.\n\nNone of the options offered allow me to open Ubuntu.\nHow do I get it to operate as my operating system?  What do I do?  I do not understand many of the term I see used in the Q & A sections.\n\nA: Boot to the Linux DVD that you burned and follow the installation prompt.  Choose the option to install along side Windows.  Continue to follow the prompt.\nThe installation is very automatic.  When the installation is complete and you reboot the computer you'll see an option to either boot into Windows or boot into Linux.\nBy the way the \"pagefiles.sys\" file is a windows component that has nothing to do with Linux.  None of the other steps that you mention has any thing to do with the actual installation.  You'll have to boot to the disk to perform the installation.\nBy the way, that is the same way you install Windows.  You boot to the installation disk.\n\nA: I understand you want to do a dual boot and that Windows XP is already installed.\nI'll try to explain it in the simplest way :\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop .

Instead, you might want to look into something called Plop Boot. Essentially, you burn a CD, then create a ubuntu usb key. You put them both in the computer, boot from CD and it will then allow you to continue booting from USB. Used it myself awhile back and works like a charm. Plop Boot Page \nAfter booting, you can use Gparted to resize your partitions, then run the install.\n\nA: I think that my answer will be a little long to explain.\nFirst, it is possible to resize the actual partition who contain Windows XP and then create a new partition to install Xubuntu on it.\nYou can see this nice tutorial to resize your windows xp partition and to create the new one for Xubuntu\n\nA: If you want to install ubuntu alongside xp, then your best bet is to use wubi.

I'm reasonably experienced with LaTeX on Win7, so is there an easy way to get LaTeX up and running?\n\nA: Three ways to go:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Ubuntu packages for texlive. Described by terdon, Easiest, but they've a tendency to be outdated and only a subset of what would be available through the tlmgr. \n\n*Install texlive from the latest iso image. Described by Medulla Oblongata. Currently available: 2013 - outdated by almost a year, so the first step after installation would be to update it using tlmgr.\n\n*Install using the network installer available at tug.org. This actually is easy, and I'd recommend it, especially if you want to keep installations across different platforms in sync. \n\n\nsee also: How do I update my TeX distribution? on tex.sx, especially for the first (community wiki) answer explaining the TeX Live update scheme.\n\nA: It's probably best to download an .iso image of a TeX distribution from CTAN, texlive2013.iso for example - it's ~2GB. Put this into your Downloads folder.\nJust ensure that you have the perl-tk package installed before using the GUI. If not, open a terminal and go:\n$ apt-get install perl-tk\n\nThen create a mount point:\n$ sudo mkdir /mnt\n\nChange the current directory, mount the .iso and start installation\n$ cd ~/Downloads\n$ sudo mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop,noauto texlive2013.iso /mnt\n$ cd /mnt\n$ sudo ./install-tl --gui=perltk\n\nThis opens up a nice GUI. You can to decide what to install in Installation collections. Also change the Create symlinks in system directories  as in the screenshot so that the directories will be all laid out for you. This means you won't need to poke around and modify your system files post-installation.\n\nAfter installation, close the terminal and open a new terminal:\n$ sudo umount /mnt\n\nCheck if everything is OK:\n$ tex --version\n\nTeX 3.1415926 (TeX Live 2013)\nkpathsea version 6.1.1\nCopyright 2013 D.E. Knuth.\n\nTry processing a .tex file and preview a PostScript file.\n$ latex sample2e.tex\n$ dvips sample2e.dvi\n\nYou can also make a .pdf file:\n$ pdflatex sample2e.tex\n\nIf you want to modify settings or get more packages, do this in TeX Live Manager 2013:\n$ sudo tlmgr -gui\n\nTo install a LaTeX editor, (e.g. TeX Studio), download the relevant .deb file into Downloads folder and install\n$ cd ~/Downloads\n$ sudo dpkg -i texstudio_2.7.0_i386.deb\n\nYou may need to install libpoppler-qt4-3.deb first.\nReferences:\nTUG documentation\nTeX Live docs\nStarlinq blog\n\nA: Just install the relevant packages from the repositories:\nsudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base\n\nThat will get you a basic LaTeX system. For a more complete installation with more packages and fonts, use this:\nsudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended\n\n\nA: You can also use  Kile - an Integrated LaTeX Environment. \nYou can easily install it from ubuntu software center.\n\n\nA: The most recent version of TeX Live packaged for Ubuntu 12.04 is 2012, which is available from the TeX Live back-ports PPA. It is relatively easy to install from the terminal, start by removing any absolute packages that may be installed:\nsudo apt-get remove texlive*              \n\nThen add the PPA and update:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:texlive-backports/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nFinally install:\nsudo apt-get install texlive\n\nThis will install the most common modules. If you come to need more specific modules then you will have to install the \"extra\" package (which at the last check was almost 1 Gb):\nsudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra\n\nFor someone coming from Windows I would recommend TexMaker as GUI (available from the Software Centre). This is what we feed to students and they manage mostly well with it.\n\nA: I ran sudo apt-get install texlive-full which has some of the disadvantages listed above including that it might not be super-up-to-date, but I've not found any problems. (Yet)\nHas the advantage that it just installs everything in one quick command. Some may argue this is bad practice / a waste of hard disk space - but I use ubuntu because it's quick and (usually) works, not because it saves me a few hundred megabytes of disk space over other linux distros...\n", "Q: Shutting down all VirtualBox (vagrant) VMs in one easy to use bash command (that can be put into a bash file) I use vagrant for development. I forget to shut down a few of the VMs. When I go to log out of my host machine, the Ubuntu shutdown process appears to hang. \nMight there be a way to script a close of all vagrant boxes with a bit of commandline-fu? Something like the following, but something that, well, works.\nfor f in $HOME/vagrant;\ndo;\n  cd $f\n  vagrant halt\ndone;\n\n\nA: Combining some of the other answers, this will close down all running virtualbox vagrant boxes:\nvagrant global-status | awk '/virtualbox running/{ print $1 }' | xargs vagrant halt\n\n\nA: In case other people get to this question: For those using VirtualBox, it already can take care of this, only involves editing a file:\n# Contents of /etc/default/virtualbox\n# ...\n# ...\n# SHUTDOWN_USERS=\"foo bar\"  \n#   check for running VMs of user 'foo' and user 'bar'\n#   'all' checks for all active users\n# SHUTDOWN=poweroff\n# SHUTDOWN=acpibutton\n# SHUTDOWN=savestate\n#   select one of these shutdown methods for running VMs\n#   acpibutton and savestate causes the init script to wait\n#   30 seconds for the VMs to shutdown\n\n## My original values\n# SHUTDOWN_USERS=\"\"\n# SHUTDOWN=poweroff\n\n## My current values\nSHUTDOWN_USERS=\"all\"\nSHUTDOWN=savestate\n\nThe upside is that is not necessary to edit/create any logout or init.d stript to run the commands posted in the other answers. The downside is this solution is specific to VirtualBox.\nTested on Ubuntu 14.10 with VirtualBox 4.3.18.\nAll credit goes to this post.\n\nA: I just use vagrant halt.  If you run it without a further argument, it stops all the machines defined in the Vagrantfile.\n\nA: The other answer is great for handling Virtualbox, but Vagrant features its own mechanisms for handling Virtual Machines, and as was mentioned in one of the comments, it supports more than just VirtualBox, just VMWare at the moment, but who knows later!\nThis seems to work for me:\nvagrant global-status | awk '/running/{print $1}' | xargs -r -d '\\n' -n 1 -- vagrant suspend\n\nNote:\nThis works with Vagrant versions after 1.6, for older versions, you should probably upgrade, but if you can't, one of the other options which focuses on Virtualbox may be better.\n\nA: My mechanism for this:\nvagrant global-status | grep virtualbox | cut -c 1-9 | while read line; do echo $line; vagrant halt $line; done;\n\n\n*\n\n*global-status lists all boxes\n\n*filter that for lines containing virtualbox (Filters out the help text, will break if you're using some other provider)\n\n*Filter that to display only the first 9 characters (the global unique ID)\n\n*While we can still read a line from that input, read it as the variable $line then:\n\n*\n\n*Print out that $line\n\n*run vagrant halt $line halting the vagrant for that global unique ID\n\n\n\nThis is better than the Virtualbox method above, because it'll run any vagrant-configured shutdown mechanisms too.\n\nA: For a scriptable control of Virtual Box machines we can make use of the VBoxManage commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*List running machines (returns name and UUID):\nVBoxManage list runningvms\n\n\n*Stop running VMs by \"hibernating\" them (reommended to avoid data loss)\nVBoxManage controlvm <name|uuid> savestate\n\n\n*Poweroff running VMs (not recommended because we may lose data in the guest)\nVBoxManage controlvm <name|uuid> poweroff\n\n\n*Use ACPI in an ACPI-aware guest OS (preferable to poweroff for graceful shutdown of guests)\nVBoxManage controlvm <name|uuid> acpipowerbutton\n\nAlso see: How to safely shutdown Guest OS in VirtualBox using command line\nUpdate from OP\nBased on this selected correct answer below, I've added this bash script \"$HOME/bin/stop-vagrant.sh\". So now I have something that can safely begin a stop of all vagrant VMs that I might have turned on yet forgotten about in a session. \nvboxmanage list runningvms | sed -r 's/.*\\{(.*)\\}/\\1/' | xargs -L1 -I {} VBoxManage controlvm {} savestate\n\nCommand Explained:\nvboxmanage list runningvms |  -- gets a list of all running vms under VirtualBox\nsed -r 's/.*\\{(.*)\\}/\\1/' | -- strips the string down to id number\nxargs -L1 -I {} VBoxManage controlvm {} savestate -- runs the save state command on each box that's open.\nOn xargs\n\n\n*\n\n*-L1 - take one line at a time \n\n*-I {} - uses {} as a place holder for the next command\n\n\nA: If you're writing scripts to parse Vagrant commands, it's advised to parse machine-friendly output (--machine-readable) which is more consistent.\nThe format is:\ntimestamp,target,type,data...\n\nso you can import it as CSV file, since it's comma-separated.\nWith shell, it's probably more difficult to parse, for example:\nfor id in $(vagrant global-status --machine-readable | cut -d, -f5 | grep -B3 running | egrep -o \"[0-9a-f]{7}\"); do\n    vagrant suspend $id;\ndone\n\nSee: Vagrant - Machine readable output\n\nHowever I find it easier to parse the standard output, e.g.\nwhile read id name provider state path; do\n  [ \"$state\" = \"running\" ] && vagrant suspend $id;\ndone < <(vagrant global-status)\n\n\nBtw. Theoretically vagrant command should accept a regular expression for the list of VMs to suspend as per this GH post, for example:\nvagrant suspend '*'\n\nbut it doesn't work and there is a bug #7221 which is pending in order to fix it.\n\nRelated GitHub tickets:\n\n\n*\n\n*GH #7220: Provide extra options for filtering the list for vagrant global-status.\n\n*GH: #7221: Implement --all for suspend or vagrant suspend-all.\n\nA: This may or may not work for you ;-) Works for me\nvagrant_halt_all.sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]\nthen\n  OPTS=\"\"\nelse\n  # force close if any arg passed\n  OPTS=\"-f\"\nfi\n\nfor i in $(vagrant global-status | grep running | awk '{print $1}'); do \n  DIR=$(vagrant global-status | grep running | awk '{print $5}')\n  cd \"$DIR\";\n  OUT=$(vagrant halt);\n  echo \"attempted to halt $i: $OUT\"\ndone\n\n\nA: Here is a compilation of working one-liners as of September 2020.

Ie. Iso, or what.\n\nA: Highly dependent on the version of hardware. Is it 32 or 64 bit hardware? 32-Bit EFI? Many things need to be added to a proper question for a thorough answer.\nLong answer cut short: The standard 14.04LTS Ubuntu AMD-64 image should work. If not, try the 14.04LTS Ubuntu AMD-64 for Mac if the first doesn't work.\nIdeally, burn the .ISO to a DVD or CD. You can put the install bits on a USB device if you have the wherewithall (www.PenDriveLinux.com has good utils and help for doing this via Windows. dd is your friend when doing it within Linux.)\nFor more specific answers, more detailed information is needed.\n", "Q: How to downgrade from 64-bit to 32-bit I have a 2gb chromebook with 64-bit ubuntu 12.04 and it runs extremly slow and often crashes so how to I downgrade it to 32-bit or is their another solution?\n\nA: It is not possible to convert an existing installation between 32-bit and 64-bit while keeping installed software. You need to do a reinstall.\nThe reason behind this is that it's actually classed as a different CPU architecture.  Despite the fact that the CPU can run either, and Linux distributions are starting to support multi-arch (and you can even run a 64-bit kernel with a 32-bit installation), you still need to choose one or the other for your base architecture and it's not something you can incrementally swap over on a working installation.\nNote too that the assumption behind your question is false. If your computer is crashing on 64-bit it is almost certainly not because it is 64-bit. While there is always a possibility that a full reinstall (whether moving to different version/architecture or not) may solve a problem - particularly if you didn't have the problem when you first installed - it represents a last resort in troubleshooting.\n\nA: You'd really need to completely reinstall, though if your /home resides on its own partition you could keep it.\nI'd be doubtful it'd give much of a boost, especially since while 64 bit is a bit hungrier on memory, it's not that much hungrier and in some ways it's faster.\nI'd try tweaking as per the various performance threads here, but on a low spec  machine I'd lean towards the lighter  desktop environments such as those that come with lubuntu  or  xubuntu. \n\nA: you have reinstall it, there's no way since the differentiation of architecture \n", "Q: How to add an application icons to the desktop in 14.04? How does one add an application icon to the desktop in verson 14.04?\nThank you for your time.\n\nA: First copy your desired application's icon from the /usr/share/applications directory to Desktop,\nsudo cp /usr/share/applications/filename.desktop ~/Desktop\n\nThen change the permissions(give execute permission to the .desktop file) of copied .desktop file on the Desktop,\nsudo chmod +x ~/Desktop/filename.desktop\n\nDouble click on the application icon to run it's corresponding application.\n\nA: Create a symbolic link in the desktop folder to the file you want to execute. \nOpen a terminal session and change to your Desktop folder:\ncd Desktop\n\nTo create the desktop icon use:\nln -sv \"target file to execute\" \"filename to create for shortcut\" (no quotes)\n\nI tried it with Nautilus and it worked fine. So far all of the icons I have created work, but they don't get an identifying icon, just the AptURL icon.\nHere's the example I created for Nautilus:\nln -sv /usr/bin/nautilus \"File Manager\"\n\nThe icon appeared on the desktop and it works fine, as have the others I made.\nYou do need to be able to find the executable files, which means you need to know some Linux, but otherwise it's pretty easy. \n\nA: Here's another easy way to do it:\n1) Open Nautilus, navigate to \"Computer\".\n$ sudo nautilus\n\n-provide your password credentials \n2) Navigate to folder /usr/share/applications\n3) In that folder, select the program of your choice (for example, System Monitor).Now Drag it to your desktop or copy & paste it.\nThat's it! \nYour Desktop icon is created.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Blank Desktop This is my first time with Ubuntu (or any Linux distro for that matter).  I installed Ubuntu 14.04 alongside windows 7. The initial install went flawlessly without any errors. After the install, I was able to login with the user I created, and then it booted up to a blank purplish screen. The only thing showing is my cursor. Left or right clicking doesn't bring up any options. I left it for an hour thinking it is still installing. Still has the blank screen. I reloaded the DVD thinking I will get a 'repair' option, but only get 'Try Ubuntu' and 'install Ubuntu'. This is on a dell laptop. Can anyone please give me a detailed step by step fix? My first experience with Ubuntu isn't going too well. \n\nA: When in the blank screen press the following keys Ctrl Alt F1 or F2, if everything went well you should see the terminal screen (similar to the windows command screen). The text; Ubuntu 14.04 LTS your computer name tty1 or tty2 should appear on screen.\nThe following line will be; your computer name login: _. You can login using your user name and password. You should then see the text user name@computer name:~$. \nType ls -a and press enter.The output should be a listing of folders and files. If you are able to complete the steps your system should basically work. It's probably the GUI which is not functioning properly. \nYou can try installing the desktop by the following command sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop (this worked for older versions). Follow the on screen prompts. If it works for you, login to the GUI with Ctrl Alt F7 or F8. If you see the desktop you should be okay, if not we need to look at different options.    \n", "Q: Duplicity Errno 28 No space left on device In addition to problems restoring files from Deja-Dup copies without Nautilus, duplicity can't even say on which device it lacks space while trying to restore a big backup.\n\nA: The problem was with /tmp being in 1G tmpfs.\nsudo mount -o bind /media/username/bigdisk/tmp /tmp\n\nsolved the problem.\nPlease write a bug report against duplicity about it.\n", "Q: How do I print the Processes data from gnome-system-monitor?

When it does happen, I generally force it off by holding the power button, because the few times I've tried to let it work itself out, it stayed there for a couple hours. Sometimes it only happens once, other times it will continue saying the same thing for hours on end. \nOnce it stops happening, it will usually be fine for a couple of days, and then come back as soon as I start to forget about it.\nGoogle has only turned up vague bug reports for other distributions that didn't even have a definitive answer. They repeatedly ended with the OP saying \"nevermind.\"\nI've been using Ubuntu for years and never had this problem. It only showed up when I made the switch to 14.04. Also, I didn't use the upgrade button. It's a clean install.\nI'm running 64-bit on an HP Probook 4530s with hybrid graphics.\nP.S. I know I said I've been using it for years, but there is still a lot I don't know. Even if you think it should be obvious, stick to baby-steps, just in case it's something I haven't run into before. My knowledge only goes as far as what I've needed to fix in the past, which isn't much.\nThanks for your time.\n\nA: I had the same issue with my laptop, a HP Probook 4530s with a ATI graphic cards. I'm also on Ubuntu 14.04. \nI could solve my problem by doing this :\nAdd this line to your /etc/rc.local file, before \"exit 0\": \n   echo OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nAnd add this to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nblacklist fglrx\nblacklist radeon\nalias radeon off\nalias lbm-radeon off\n\nIt will disable your ATI discrete graphics card, this way you won't have any problem with Radeon when booting your laptop. Personally, my laptop works perfectly without the discrete card, I can use blender without problem for example. \n\nA: I have exactly the same laptop, and bumped into that problem in Ubuntu 14.04. It seems that it's the fault of the open source driver for ATI graphic cards in Ubuntu 14.04.\nI did these things and got rid of it:\n\n\n*\n\n*In BIOS settings I unchecked \"Enable GPU switching\" (something like it, don't remember exactly the label).\n\n*Restarted and this time got past that problem, but Unity only showed the desktop and icon and no Launcher and decorations. This problem is solved by following this post.\n\n\nNOTE: These are the steps that I think they solved my problem; because I was struggling for 3 hours and doing many things. I tried to use ATI's proprietary drivers (using Additional Drivers in Ubuntu). They didn't work and I removed them. I even installed the driver I downloaded from ATI website (which was working fine in my previous Ubuntu 12.04), but it didn't work either. I reinstalled ubuntu-desktop and Unity and many other things that I don't remember exactly.\n", "Q: Safe method to install Ubuntu on MBR disk with 4 primary partitions \nThat's my partitions.

Are there too many partitions? What can I do? If you know the answer, please tell me what to do. Thanks.\n\nA: Those partition you have mentioned are created by windows 8.1, don't delete anything. You actual partition is sda4 (499.6GB) where windows is already installed.\nFor dual boot, try following the method shown here.\n", "Q: How to make windows 8.1 first boot priorty in gnu grub menu I have dual boot of windows 8.1 and ubuntu 12.04.\nThe problem is every time I turn on my netbook  ubuntu will be the priority in the gnu grub menu.\nIf I don't select windows it will automatically boot into ubuntu...\nHow do I make windows first boot priority before ubuntu?\n\nA: In file /etc/default/grub you have a line:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n\nwhich you can change to indicate the windows selection, but every time a new kernel gets added, that number would change.\n  A more permanent method is to rename the file /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober to 06_os-prober\n(or the custom file if you put your windows boot paragraph into one of those).  The files are run in order, so that should always put Windows first.\n", "Q: Software Unavailable in 14.04 LTS Lots of software that were downloadable in the previous versions of Ubuntu (like 11.10, 12.04 LTS, 13.10) seem not to be available in 14.04 LTS. Like, Synapse is not available, or GnomeBaker. There maybe a lot more but I have not explored further. Using Ubuntu without Synapse is frustrating, since I have got so much used to it. So, how can I get Synapse in my computer? Should I revert to my older 12.04 LTS version?\n\nA: Sometimes programs are dropped in which case you can downgrade to 12.04 as you suggested or try installing another way like using the old repos package file, seeing if the program devs have their own up to date repos, or installing from source.\nSynapse:\nYou can download the 13.10 version from http#://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/synapse and install it. My understanding is it has a bug involving Unity/Gnome3 which is why Synapse hasn't yet been included. Some people say this version works fine in 14.04.

What will happen if I turn swap off then turn it on again (sudo swapoff -a; sudo swapon -a) when memory and swap are both near maximum?\n\nA: I don't remember if the Gnome System Monitor includes cache files in its memory calculation (I think it doesn't), but you can run free -m to see the actual free memory (on the second row).\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          7915       7180        734        134        197       4581\n-/+ buffers/cache:       2401       5513\nSwap:         4024         87       3937\n\nIn my case, I have 5513 MB of RAM free, which 4581 MB of it being pre-cached with files.\nAnyways, running sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a when there isn't enough RAM available will just cause the command to fail, and won't do any harm to your system.\nTo find out what process might still be taking up RAM, sort the column by memory usage, or use top or htop.\n", "Q: Can't create folders from GUI even though I'm ADMIN/ROOT I'm pretty new to ubuntu, or linux for that matter, and I'm trying to perform the simplest activity ever,  copy and paste a file; for some reason, when I right-click the folder /usr/bin I see that the 'paste' option is gray (meaning I can't select it). \nWhy is that? I'm pretty sure I'm the ROOT User. I can see \"Account type = Administrator\" on the account's settings.\n\nA: You're not the root user; you are a user which has the privilege to become root, using the sudo (or various graphical surrogates) method. \nIn Ubuntu (and in most not-embedded Unix environment) you normally work, and have the privileges, of a normal user. Only deliberately you can override the normal rules; it is a way of telling you that you have to know what you are doing. It is a great safety net that works normally quite well(1).\nFor example, although it can have legitimate uses, trying to add manually a file to /usr/bin is normally wrong. \nYou can find all the info you need here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo \n(1) although remember that Unix, in general, gives you rope(2) if you really want to hang yourself. \n(2) You can run the file manager application as root, as explained in the other answer. \nAlas, you shouldn't. \nThis is the rope I mentioned in (1). A wrong click, a spurious double click, and you can have a completely messed up system, to the point of having to reinstall it. I am a power user, and I have to use root powers maybe... once a week? And most of the time is just to install some program, which you can do easily via the graphical application. \nYou should be able to do all of your work in normal mode; copy and paste between places you own works perfectly with the graphical interface.

Is it possible to format a partition and then converge it with the other partition so that the storage capacity of the other partition with the OS increases?\nActually, I am suffering that. I got two partitions on my hard disk. Both being 232 GB. I\nactually wanted to know if all of 464 GB can be used with one OS in one partition only by removing the OS from the former partition?\n\nA: No, removing one partition will not automatically increase another. You need some partition manager software, like Gparted or fdisk. There you should remove one partition and resize another. You should boot into LiveCD/USB to use Gparted or fdisk because they require the partitions to be unmounted before doing any operation.\n\nA: When you delete a partition it just becomes unpartitioned space. Depending on your partition setup you may be able to then extend the existing partition, thereby using up that free space. Without knowing specifics of your partitions it's impossible to tell.\nScreenshot of what happens when you delete a partition:\nBefore = https://copy.com/wOy2HMKOffcz\nAfter = https://copy.com/kDOl7RX0yJPx\nSteps:\nStep #1\nIn terminal type sudo apt-get install gparted.

Then I switch to Gnome Shell and I add it.

Using the former, Super + Space (which previously was Ctrl + Space in 13.10), only toggles between the default keyboard layout (German for me) and English, but Anthy doesn't enable, even though it can be selected in the language selector applet (and then works and can be disabled once via keyboard, too).\nFor another user of that system, the toggling was still working, so I compared the configuration using dconf-editor.

After upgrading to Trusty, upon login, after resume I always get a dialog asking for the PIN of the SIM card. Marking \"remember PIN\" while answering doesn't help - the same dialog appears again upon next login or resume.\nAny hints how to get rid of that dialog and remember the PIN? I'm aware that I can switch off PIN usage on the SIM itself, but I'd prefer a solution where the PIN is remembered.\nAddendum based on comments below\nI have a broandband connection configured containing the PIN as well. The connection works perfectly fine.\nThe issue is that the PIN dialog pops up upon login and resume even if WWAN connection is not activated. Default connection is ethernet or Wifi. \nAs a side information: I'm using TLP - but I doubt that this is related to the issue.\nThe requested screenshot:\n\n\nA: I had same problem once on my Lenovo ThinkPad x230 but in Release 12.04 LTS with TLP. I then did find a solution so I disabled the SIM pin code on the card, then it stopped asking again and again. I know that is not a proper solution but maybe a workaround.\n\nA: TLP has settings to do things like power off PCI express, USB, etc when the machine is locked or goes to sleep or whatever. I would play with those settings and set it up so that your mobile card doesn't do anything when you close the lid or log out or lock the desktop or put it to sleep.\nIf that doesn't work, find the location of the config file and check the permissions. Make sure your user can both read and write. You could also try running the T-Mobile Bearbeiten tool with sudo or as the root user (\"sudo su -\" then your regular user password).\nBasically, you need to make sure nothing is turning off or resetting the device (TLP or some Ubuntu power settings) and also make sure that the config file responsible for saving the password can be read and written by the user you login with.\nIf this doesn't help, let me know and I'll setup a similar situation on my pc and see if I can recreate and fix it.\n", "Q: Bash script doesn't execute command from PATH I have this simple script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho ${HADOOP_HOME}\n$(hadoop fs -ls)\n\nThe output is:\n/opt/hadoop-0.20.2-cdh3u2\n./hello.sh: line 3: Found: command not found\n\nSo bash definitely sees HADOOP_HOME.

So the script will look like,\n#!/bin/bash\necho ${HADOOP_HOME}\necho $(hadoop fs -ls)\n\nIf you give the command like this $(hadoop fs -ls), bash parses it and find it's value.

The\npossible names are:\n    DESKTOP\n    DOWNLOAD\n    TEMPLATES\n    PUBLICSHARE\n    DOCUMENTS\n    MUSIC\n    PICTURES\n    VIDEOS\n\nSorry, but you are not able to add new entries to the Places menu and have it recognized by the xdg-* tools.  Bookmarks are changeable.  Depending on the version and flavor of Linux you can find a menu item to add/edit bookmarks, press Ctrl-D, or press on a gear symbol to add a location as a bookmark.  Your bookmarks are stored in .config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks.  It appears that duplicate entries (ones in both Bookmarks and Places) only show up in Places, at least in Nautilus.\n\nA: There are a number of ways to add a link to places.  It's called bookmark.  While in the directory that you want added click on the bookmark menu and mark it as a book mark.\n", "Q: How can I install cpuminer? I am trying to install cpuminer according to this tutorial.

I post it here, since it is more distro-specific.\nThe shell used by default for sh namely dash, is not compatible with execvp because it fiddles with the $PATH variable. A standardized way of dealing with strange filenames is to use URL encoding scheme. Now I cannot use that standard because dash reserves %. To solve this I problem I have the following options\n\n\n*\n\n*Recommend my users on Ubuntu to change the symbolic link /bin/sh to something else like bash. It is necessary to do it globally since popen(3) relies on /bin/sh. \n\n*Diverge from traditional URL encoding by using something other than %\n\n*Throw an error whenever any of the Forbidden characters (yes, Windows but these restriction is sane in a dual-boot configuration) appears.\nIdeally I prefer option (1) seems the best way to go. It makes it possible to use a standardized escape scheme in filenames. However, since dash clearly behaves differently than some other shells, it will break the system if any of the system scripts rely on functionality unique to dash. Also it requires that the user has root privileges.\nOption (2) implies that I have to find another symbol that does not collide anywhere. Certainly, some shell may screw up any symbol that is not a letter.\nOption (3) implies too large reduction in functionality\n\nA: Option one is fairly simple. You just need to run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure dash\n\nAnd pick No. That'll push /bin/sh back to /bin/bash.\nYou could do this manually (removing the link, creating a new one) but this is the official method.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server file transfer configuration I have a desktop computer (Ubuntu Server) and a laptop (Lubuntu desktop).\nI want to use an ethernet cable to directly connect the two and use the Server to network all my storage media and serve it to my laptop via the ethernet cable.\nI've seen tutorials on how to connect two computers by creating an IP for them in nm-applet. \nMy question is how to do this via the command line on Ubuntu Server?\nAlso, I don't want a lot of overhead.

The problem is that it is too slow - even minimizing a window takes 2-3 seconds.\nThe reason I think this is a problem, because I have a fairly strong machine here: my CPU is i5-3470, and I have 8 Gigabytes of DDR3 running on intel SSD with SATA3. Checking the hardware monitor while running the VM shows that I only use 4 Gigabytes and CPU usage is around 5% idle.\nHere's what I think: I have an onboard graphics card that can't run all of the windows' eye candy fast enough. Also, in VirtualBox preferences, I can't check 2d/3d acceleration, as I get a message about invalid configurations.\nAm I right? And if not, any suggestions?\nThanks!\n\nA: Your CPU integrated card should be enough to run Windows 8 eyecandy.\nThe fact that you can't check 2d/3d acceleration makes me wonder if you have too little memory allocated to the virtual video card. \nTry to increase it in the Display section at the virtual machine preferences menu. Make it at least 256 Mb if possible.\n\n\nA: VirtualBox acceleration requires both the host and guest to have the correct functionality installed.  In addition, 2D acceleration is only available if you specify the Guest OS to be Windows.  This means you'll need Host DKMS in Linux, and Guest Additions in Windows.  For other functionality, you may want to add yourself to the vboxusers group, and restart your machine.\nTo install DKMS, install virtualbox-dkms and then reboot the machine:\nsudo apt install virtualbox-dkms\n\nTo install Guest Additions, you need the image, and to provide that image to the Guest on a ROM drive. To get the image, visit VirtualBox Website, or use apt:\nsudo apt install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\n\nThe specifics are available on the Ubuntu Wiki.\n\nOnce these are available, and you've selected Windows as the guest OS, you'll be able to select 2D or 3D acceleration. If you chose one, or both, and see a warning, hover your mouse over the warning to read what's causing the error.\n", "Q: Use SSH to connect with PC in local network I want to access the PC's connected in local network.

After attempting for five hours, I have still not been able to install Ubuntu.\nI use an HP Envy M6 with an existing installation of Windows 8.  \nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling Secure Boot in the BIOS\n\n*Disabling fast booting in Windows 8\n\n*Changing the boot order in the BIOS so that the USB boots first (causing a BSOD, which I eventally solved)\n\n*Using the UNetbootin tool to create my bootable USB (from the .iso image I downloaded earlier)\n\n\nThis has really been frustrating. I had thought the whole process would be as easy I read on the official Ubuntu website. \n\nA: You seem to have problem not with installing the system per se, but with starting installation.\nIf you're sure, you've disabled fastboot, you need to get to \"boot menu\".\nBefore windows start kicks in you probably see either full screen HP logo, or some hardware information - look for information that reads \"Boot menu - [KEY]\".\nThen press that before Windows starts. you should be presented with menu where you'll be able to choose a device you want to boot from (usual suspects are keys F2, F11, F12 and DEL).\nNow, you might get 2 options for the USB drive - UEFI and some other (it might be named \"old\", \"standard\" or something else.

I've read a lot about it, but can't find the correct answer. \nThere is an i7-3630QM CPU @ 2.40GHz with 3.20GHz turbo in my Lenovo Y580 notebook. If i put the cpu at full load (with rendering in blender on 8 threads) the frequency jumps to around 3.2GHz for all cores, but after a few seconds, when the temperature rises, the frequency decreases to 2.4GHz, and stay on it during the rendering, (the fan does not run at max speed).\nWhen i used ubuntu 12.10 this problem not occured, but it does in 13.10 and 14.04. \nMy notebooks cooler is really good, so there is no toverheating problem with the full speed turbo boost (the cpu temp was 85-90°C at 3.2GHz in ubuntu 12.10), so i want to use it on full speed. How can i use the cpu with turbo boost at full 3.2GHz speed in ubuntu 14.04 without this (temperature?) limit?\n(after discuss with terdon)\nI think the problem is that cpu freq is scaled down before the fan could respond to the high temperature. AFTER cpu scaled back from 3.2GHz to 2.4GHz the fan spins up for a moment, but because cpufreq already scaled down, it generates less heat, so the fan's rpm falls back. It would be ok, if after cpu cooling down, frequency rise again to 3.2GHz, but it stays on 2.4GHz.\nSome measurements:\nOutput of i7z program, when the render just started:\n Cpu speed from cpuinfo 2394.00Mhz                                                                                                                               \ncpuinfo might be wrong if cpufreq is enabled.

Check your temperatures, the only reason the CPU speed is decreased is because you're overheating. Look at the first output you show, you have one of your cores running at 92°C! That's pretty hot to begin with and it probably went even higher before your clock speed was reduced.\nYou can check the maximum temperature your CPU can deal with by running sensors. For example, for my Intel i7:\n$ sensors\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 0:       +77.0°C  (high = +95.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\nCore 2:       +79.0°C  (high = +95.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\n\nSo, on my machine, 95.0°C is considered high and 105°C is the critical temperature at which the machine will be shut down. Your specs might be a little different but 92.0°C is definitely high. \nNow, you can force your CPU to keep the same clock speed. This is controlled by the CPU governor. You probably have it set to ondemand, but the following options are available:\n\n\n*\n\n*Performance keeps the CPU at the highest possible frequency\n\n*Powersave keeps the CPU at the lowest possible frequency\n\n*Userspace exports the available frequency information to the user level (through the /sys file system) \n          and permits user-space control of the CPU frequency\n\n*Ondemand scales the CPU frequencies according to the CPU usage (like does the userspace frequency scaling \n         daemons, but in kernel)\n\n*Conservative acts like the ondemand but increases frequency step by step\n\n\nTo change your governor to, for example, \"Performance\", run this:\necho \"performance\" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n\nHowever, the likely result will simply be that your computer will shutdown when the high temperatures are reached. It might also still scale it down, I'm not sure how the safety features are implemented. In any case, the main point is that you don't want to do this because it can seriously harm your hardware. \nThere are very good reasons why your computer won't let you go past certain temperatures and you don't want to screw with that. I don't know of any way to actually disable the temperature limit and I wouldn't tell you if I did. There are easier ways, but disabling the temperature safety limits is certainly a good way to destroy your computer.\n\nA: After long searching i find the answer for my question on tis page:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/prevent-your-laptop-from-overheating.html\nThe old acpi-cpufreq can't control turbo boost well, but intel_pstate driver and thermald can. I've enabled intel_pstate and installed thermald. Now cpu can run in turbo boost mode, on 3.2GHz nearly continuously. It means about 25-30 % additional performance during rendering in blender. \nUnfortunately it also means more heat, so my CPU core temperature moves arround 90-100°C, and sometimes throttles itself. So tredon you were right, I should clean the fan. :) \nOn Intel's page 105 °C is the maximum junction temperature of my CPU, over it thermal throttling is activated, so I don't have to worry about overheating the CPU.\nUnfortunately I can't find any useful example to configure and using thermald, so I leave the default options, but as I read it could help a lot in cooling.\n", "Q: Internet (both wifi and LAN) Stop working after some time I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on Dell N4050.

I want to convert a batch of images, nearly 100, from jpg to png format. How can I do this without renaming them, but instead actually converting the format?\n\nA: Using ImageMagick.\nFirst install imagemagick:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\nTry converting just one image at first:\nconvert image.jpg image.png\n\nNow convert all:\nmogrify -format png *.jpg\n\nEDIT\nYou also need to split it into chunks that will fit to avoid hitting the limit of how much you can put on a command line. This should work better:\nfind -name '*.jpg' -print0 | xargs -0 -r mogrify -format png\n\nThe -print0 and -0 are used to handle spaces in filenames and the -r means don't run mogrify if there's nothing to do.\nSource: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1010261/running-a-batch-with-imagemagick\nEDIT 2\nSwitched png and jpg as per @Glutanimate's comment.\nEDIT 3\nChanged png to jpg in last suggestion.\n\nA: Firstly, convert works. You don't need to test it. Secondly, a bash oneliner suits the need:\n$ for file in Ground*jpg; do { \\\n  echo \"Converting $file to `echo $file|cut -d. -f1`.png\" ;\\\n  convert $file `echo $file|cut -d. -f1`.png ; } done\n\nRockin' it auldskewl ;)\nCheers\n\nA: Try these commands,\nmogrify -format png /path/*.jpg    \n\nThis will convert all the .jpg files into .png files and saves the converted files in the same directory.\nmv /path/*.png ~/Desktop/pic\n\nThis will moves all the .png files(converted) to the pic directory which resides on the Desktop.\nDisclaimer:\nIf you want to keep the orientation of your image you have to add -auto-orient to the command. You can find out why here. The mogrify command which keeps the orientation  would look like this:\nmogrify -auto-orient -format png /path/*.jpg    \n\n\nA: I know it's been a long time since this question was put but there is one brilliant piece of software that has not been mentioned that I have used a lot.\nhttp://photobatch.wikidot.com/  also known as Phatch.

Not delete but purge. In the example below there could be some packages missing from the purge list:\nsudo apt-get purge vlc vlc-data vlc-plugin-pulse vlc-nox\n\nIf you are missing VLC packages simply do an apt show vlc or apt-cache search vlc but I recommend aptitude because of the friendly level compared to apt which is better: aptitude search vlc or aptitude show vlc. Both will show the packages, the former will show what packages you actually have installed. Remove those.\n\n*After you have removed ANY trace of VLC then make sure you don't have any conflict between 2 or more repositories that offer the VLC package or make sure you do not have an Alpha, Beta, Snapshot PPA that offers daily or not tested VLC packages. Type software-properties-gtk and it should open the Repository manager. Select Other Software and start looking in there for any VLC like PPA. Disable it or remove it.\n\n*Lastly go to /var/cache/apt/archives and remove all DEB packages (This is the cache folder for downloaded packages). This will make sure that when you tell apt to install the vlc packages again, it won't take the cache one but will download a new/working one instead. By doing sudo rm -fr *.deb INSIDE the /var/cache/apt/archives folder you will remove all deb packages in it.\n\n*After doing all 3 steps mentioned already, do a sudo apt-get update followed by an sudo apt-get upgrade. Wait until all repositories are updated and everything was updated and then do sudo apt-get install vlc. If you want, before installing VLC again, reboot PC to make sure no process, symlink or anything is still lurking around.

We have a hp pavilion v72 desktop computer from the year 2004. It had Windows XP running on it,  and we have been trying to install Linux on it. \nAfter Ubuntu, we tried to install the 32 bit version of Lubuntu 13.10 from a disk image downloaded directly from the lubuntu.net web page, and it said it was successfully installed but after re-start it doesn't start the graphical user interface, eg. the screen remains black after the spash screen. The same happens, when we choose the option \"Try Lubuntu\". The computer's specifications meet the requirements of the lubuntu distribution. It has two graphic cards, one onboard, which can't be disabled in the bios and another one, which is configured as primary display adapter in the bios. The system can be booted to root shell and everythings appears to be fine, but when x-windows is started, the computer again hangs with an empty screen.\nDo you have any suggestions, if trying another linux distribution (like xubuntu) might potentially solve the problem? Until recently, when we wiped the windows xp system, the computer worked perfectly well, so we don't assume, that the computer's hardware is defective.\nMany thanks.\nAnne\n\nA: I would try to install Debian stable in case Ubuntu fails.\nAlso, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is reasonable option. But make sure you try to boot with both graphic cards to see if that is the case.\nBut, you didn't gave us much more details except that one.

Starting with version 13.10 and continuing with 14.04, two bugs plague the Copy.com application on Ubuntu (see this thread): \n\n\n*\n\n*sometimes, the application indicator is not at all visible \n\n*even if it is visible, the menu is not readable (no menu entries except for one or two), like this:\n\n\n\nHow can I get rid of these two bugs?\n\nA: Update: a work-around was added in the Copy client so the instructions below are no longer needed if you use the latest Copy!\nThe Copy.com client indicator menu doesn't work properly in Ubuntu 14.04 and 13.10 due to a bug in libdbusmenu. \nThis bug was fixed in Ubuntu 14.10 and I'm not sure when it will be fixed in older Ubuntu versions but you can get the Copy.com indicator menu to work right now in Ubuntu 14.04 and 13.10 by using the fix /  work-around below.\nFirst of all: be sure to delete Copy versions eventually installed manually.\nThen:\ncd /tmp\nwget https://github.com/hotice/webupd8/raw/master/libdbusmenu-gtk-$(arch).tar.gz\ntar -xvf libdbusmenu-gtk*\nsudo cp /tmp/libdbusmenu-gtk*/* /PATH/TO/COPY-FOLDER/\n\nThe instructions above will download libdbusmenu-gtk compiled with the fix and copy it to the copy-client folder. For the last command, replace \"/PATH/TO/COPY-FOLDER/\" with the path to where you've installed Copy. If you've used the Copy PPA, the path is /opt/copy-client/\nThis work-around / fix includes libdbusmenu-gtk built by me. If you want to build it yourself, see HERE.\nvia WebUpd8 \n\nA: *\n\n*For the bug #1 (lack of the indicator): the reason for this appears to be that ever since 13.10, the systray is missing in Unity (see this question). In short, one needs to replace Unity with a modified version. This repository seems to work in 13.10, but did not work with 14.04 for me. For trusty (14.04), I found this repository usable: ppa:gurqn/systray-trusty\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:gurqn/systray-trusty\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n(Source)\n\n*Second bug is tricky and seems to appear on x86_64 architectures only. It turns out that it is due to a single setting in the configuration file in the local copy configuration folder. It can be easily modified, but requires the sqlite3 package to access the sqlite configuration file of copy. \nFirst, kill or otherwise close Copy. Then, in terminal, do the following:\nsudo apt-get install sqlite3\ncd $HOME/.copy\necho 'UPDATE config2 SET value=0 WHERE option=\"csmBlackWhiteIconsV2\" ;' | sqlite3 config.db\n\nThis should repair your menu.\nEDIT: although the above seems to be a correct solution for at least a couple of users with a x86_64 system, clanlaw below (who uses 32b) reports that the change made his copy indicator disappear completely. Here is how to revert to the original setting:\necho 'UPDATE config2 SET value=1 WHERE option=\"csmBlackWhiteIconsV2\" ;' | sqlite3 config.db\n\n", "Q: How to recover from failed installment of codelite My system initially is ubuntu 12.04.

The result when viewing documents in continuous mode is that there appear to be big chunks of needless white space in the middle of the document (where in fact there is merely a page boundary), and it looks rather odd.\nI don't want to turn off continuous mode, and apart from this I think evince is brilliant, so I'd be very reluctant to change pdf viewer.\nIs this change in appearance caused by the new default theme in 14.04 (with its lack of borders)? What can I do to get back my bordered documents?\n\nA: Change the theme from \"Ambiance\" to \"Adwaita\" solved the problem for me.  But you have to like this new theme.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a fresh hard drive I am building a new computer and instead of buying Windows 8 again (they aren't letting me use my other copy to put on my new hard drive) I wanted to know if I could install Ubuntu on a new, internal hard drive?\nI have read a few forums and it seems like it is, but I wanted to ask for myself before I went ahead and did something that could potentially be stupid.\n\nA: Yes you can do a clean install with Ubuntu on this computer.  Simply download an installation iso from Ubuntu.com, burn it to a dvd and follow the installation instructions here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop\nYou should have no problems.\nBy the way, I'm assuming you're installing Ubuntu on a new computer with a blank hard drive and there are no other drives with other OSes on the system.\n\nA: Yes, it will be possible.\nYou can not download the installation from an empty system though; you will need to download it from another system with a working operating system (or buy a dvd from Canonical ;) )\nAnd you do not need a dvd player (even though that is probably still the most used method), an install from USB is possible too. \nDo have a search on each component just to check if there are issues in relation to Ubuntu. 2 come to mind: keep away from SIS graphics (if you can still find those) and from wireless with Broadcom chip (those are around alot). And stay away from canon printers (heck, only HP has an excellent trackrecord).\n", "Q: How do I replace Windows XP with Lubuntu? I am rather a noob and have never installed anything before, but I would really like to completely replace my Windows XP with Lubuntu. I have saved all my photos and music already so that is sorted. The thing is I really don't know step-by-step what to do next. I have blank CDs and a USB all ready to go but what next? Please be gentle with me! (o:\nHey man thanks so much for the reply! I think in a normal world it would work brilliantly but sadly my computer is not living in the normal world. \nI followed you advice to the letter but I think perhaps because my computer is stuck in the loop of 'windows genuine notifications' it is blocking normal pathways. I do have genuine windows but it has apparently been a problem for a lot of people in the past and i tried for a few days last year to fix it with internet advice but it didn't take.\nANYHoo ... what has been happening is it all works until i get to where it is downloaded and i try to right click to copy or burn but it wants me to 'open with' and when I try to open it with something i have a limited list of things like 'firefox/explorer/winrar.exe/windows media player etc' if i try to 'open' it with firefox i get a blank page and nothing happens, if i try to open it with winrar i get a red 'x' sign, if i try to open it with anything windows based i get a 'windows genuine notifications' request which is impenetrable as i have learned over the years...\ncould you perhaps recommend something for me to download that would be an appropriate channel through which i can 'open' the downloaded file? if i can get past that i'm sure it would be smooth sailing. \nCheers!\n\nA: 1) Download the lubuntu .iso from http://lubuntu.net/. Choose 'x86 CD' if you have an older computer, and 64-bit only if you have a newer computer with 4gigs of RAM or more.\n2) When its downloaded, right click on the .iso file, and chose to burn it to disc. If there is no option to do this, search for 'iso burning windows XP'\n3) Leave the disc in after burning, and restart your machine. To boot from the disc, there is normally a key combination you'll need to do (like hold the 'escape' button). Again, you can search for this dependent on your computer.\n4) Follow installation instructions and you're away. You'll find it amazingly fast compared to XP\n\nA: You have to burn the ISO to a CD.  Do not copy it.  You do not need to open it to burn it.  Just open up your CD burner and choose/add the ISO to burn.\nAlternatively, download UNetbootin to burn the ISO to a flash/pen drive which will also make a bootable imagine.

I see that you are getting between 1-7 errors per second--a lot.\nUDP packet receive errors probably represent something mangling the data in those packets. There's an optional checksum in UDP packets that are used to detect bad UDP packets.\nPacket mangling could normally happen anywhere on the Internet, but DHCP packets should only be coming from your own LAN. On the other hand--that's a lot of errors to be coming only from DHCP. DHCP is only used when systems boot, and usually once every few hours per computer--not seven times a second. What else are you running on this server?\nI would check the network connection for the computer in question, maybe swapping out the network adapter and the switch port to which it is probably connected to see if that helps.\nAnother thing to try is to use the combination of tcpdump and wireshark to identify what those bad packets are--something strange may be going on.\n", "Q: On Ubuntu 14.04 Centrino Wireless-N 1030 constantly disconnects I've installed Ubuntu 14.04. My wifi occasionally disconnects and I have to  turn it off then back on to get wifeless again.\nI am using Centrino Wireless-N 1030.\n\nA: It seems to be due to buggy N mode of the driver, you can disable it e.g.\nmodprobe -r iwlwifi && modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\nSee more details here and here:\nBtw I upgraded from 12.10 to 14.04 and was facing this problem, but once I re-installed I don't see this problem.\n\nA: I used to have the same problem.

Every time when I have some memory intensive things running on one user and switch to another one, I can see that the memory usage continues. Is the other user actually still running? If so, is it possible to have Ubuntu save the user workspace state to the harddrive and then kill everything running or something equal?\n\nA: There is not a way to do this currently with Ubuntu's Unity interface. See this related question for a possible solution.\nHow could Unity2D save sessions?\nIt is unreliable in Ubuntu Gnome. There is a bug here, which is marked as \"Fix Released,\" but seems to not be fixed. See this related bug if you want to try it.\n\nA: \nIs the other user actually still running?\n\nYes.  Linux is a multi-user system by default.  This design goes back to early UNIX systems which ran on mainframes and had to support requests from multiple users.  These users typically accessed the sytem from specialized hardware known as \"dumb\" terminals, which were little more than a monitor, keyboard, and a (coaxial) network connection.\nA running process is owned by a user, and that user is not required to be logged-in while it is running.  Several applications that run on Linux will have and run under their own users.  And these users will probably never \"log on\" to the system.\nThis is an important concept to understand.  By simply executing a \"switch user,\" all you are doing is bringing another user on to the system.  Your original user (and all its processes) will remain active on the system.\n\nIf so, is it possible to have Ubuntu save the user workspace state to\n  the harddrive and then kill everything running or something equal?\n\nProbably the best option you have here, is to log out from the first user, and then log in as another.  This should put a stop to most of the first user's resource footprint.  Unless of course that user is running a process in the background, which will \"live-on\" despite a log out.\n", "Q: Can't connect to WiFi I downloaded Ubuntu and now I can't connect to WiFi and that is why do something.

Again the installer crashes after partitioning saying it could not delete needed files from /target/ though nothing is there.\n\n\nI've read the info on an Ubuntu wiki article and I'm guessing I'm running into the problems they mention there about set-default breaking Ubuntu's layout. Though my interpretation was that that is only an issue after install - I can't even get that far.\nWhat is the best practice here? My reason for wanting to install onto a separate subvolume is to keep my Ubuntu install distinct from everything else on the drives. Is it safe to do an install into the root-subvolume without risking nuking my data?\n\nA: disclaimer\nI've never used btrfs RAID. The solution is tested only on single-volume btrfs root partitions\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure, there are no /@ and /@home subvolumes on the candidate for root.\n\n*Launch the Ubuntu installer, and choose something else when it asks you about disk partitioning.\n\n*Mark your btrfs partition as root filesystem, but don't let the installer reformat it. \n\n*Arrange all the other partitions as you like. I always choose to use external /boot partition on gpt systems, so I can later migrate into something more advanced (e.g. bcache) or whatever. (On gpt you can have as many partitions as you want, so I see no real drawback of using dedicated /boot.)\n\n*Finish the installation. \nThe installer will make the @ and @home subvolumes for you. Later you can rename them into something different - just be sure you also update the new name on both /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\nTested on Ubuntu 14.04, Mint 16, Mint 15, Ubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 13.04.\n", "Q: update on ubuntu 14.04 \"E: Some index files failed to download.

I recently encountered that my /bin/sh is a symlink to dash, which is apparently default system shell for ubuntu since its 6.10 release. \nI didn't know system shell is different from login shell. I can intuitively guess what the role of system shell should be, but I'm looking for more precise definition of what a system shell is and how does it differ from login shell.\n\nA: A large number of shell instances are started as part of the Ubuntu boot process. Those are executed in system shell.\n\nA login shell is the first process that executes under your user ID when you log in for an interactive session. \n\nYou get a login shell when you login and obtain a shell providing your user id and password in an interactive manner. \nFor example \n\n\n*\n\n*[i] tty login using Ctrl+Alt+Fn (n=1 to 6, n=7 is the GUI)\n\n*[ii] ssh login etc.\nWhen you login to X system you also get a login shell. A login shell reads /etc/profile and ~/.profile (in absence of ~/.bash_profile) if your default login shell is bash.\n\nThe default login shell is bash, it is not changed. \nBash is an excellent full-featured shell appropriate for interactive use. However, it is rather large and slow to start up and operate by comparison with dash. \nTo speed up the boot process the Ubuntu core development team changed the system shell, /bin/sh  to dash.\n", "Q: Window themes not getting applied I downloaded Tweak Tool changing window theme doesn't change anything but changing from Appearance changes.\nWhy is it so?\n\n\n*\n\n*Has the default theme directory changed from /usr/share/themes?\n\n*Tweak tool doesnt work for Unity?\n\n*How to install new (metacity,gtk3) themes downloaded from gnome-look.org ?\n\n\nA: In 14.04 Ubuntu stopped using metacity to draown the windows, and now it's integrated with the gtk css code (located in [theme]/gtk-3.0).

There is an option to select which operating system you are using as well.\n\nA: Sounds like a bad iso. Download a new iso to your Windows machine and selsct burn to disk. If you have ubuntu installed and it's sending you to the desktop change your boot order to 1 being the cdrom. When your BIOS screen appares press pause / break to pause the boot. Read the screen to see which key takes you to boot options. If your looking for a Live USB, you can also create a Live USB from an iso file in your Windows machine using a program called Unetbootin you can download from sourceforge. Also availible in software center. If you want an actual installed Linux on a USB instead of a HDD or SSD. Put in your Live DVD and select try Ubuntu. When you get to the Ubuntu desktop there should be an icon that says Install Ubuntu. Install your USB and then click the install icon. When you get to the install screen go to do something else and select the USB. Remember your filesystem is ext4 and your mount point is root ( / ) and leave 4gb in your partition. Then in that 4gb create a partition and select ( linux swap ). Then proceed with your install. Ubuntu on USB runs a little slower then from a drive.

I am suffering from the problem described here and here, which unfortunately still hasn't been fixed. Basically after rebooting my computer my volume is at 100% until I trigger the volume. What I mean by this is that the software volume indicator is showing the setting that was set before (e.g. 20%) however the actual sound will be played at 100% until I move the slider a bit and the system \"realises\" what the volume setting is. I am using an external DAC (which is like a USB soundcard) which is a Schiit Audio.\nAs a workaround I'm trying to trigger the volume by adding the following command to the startup applications list (Session and Startup) as suggested here:\npacmd set-sink-volume 2 20000\n\nUnfortunately this doesn't seem to work, possibly because the Pulse Audio System is not running yet when the command is executed. I've tried sleeping before executing it, but that doesn't help either; moreover I want to have a guarantee that the volume has been set properly so that I don't have to live a stressful life ;)\nI've tried renaming my task so that it is at the end of the list to no avail.\nIs there any other way for me to set the volume automatically after Pulse Audio loads? I don't want to get a heart attack every time I forget to retrigger the volume after login...\nI am using Xubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: The pulseaudio module responsible to restore any device's volume to values before rebooting is the module-device-restore. If restoring devices does not work as expected  we may want to check if that module was loaded with:\npacmd list-modules\n\nIf it was not there we should add the module to our default.pa settings file. This file is located in /etc/pulse by default but we can have an additinal per-user default.pa overriding this in ~/.pulse/ or in ~/.config/pulse/. When editing make sure you choose the appropriate file, and make a backup beforehand.\nTo load module-device-restore on starting the pulseaudio sound server the following line has to be included (or uncommented) in the default.pa:\nload-module module-device-restore\n\n", "Q: Setting pdnsd server I installed pdnsd: it is correctly working. \nMy problem is that it ignores the opendns server I provided in the \"server\" section of pdnsd.conf labeled \"resolvconf\": instead of it, it uses the server which is provided by the dhcp.\nOn the other hand, if I change the name of the server section to something else, then pdnsd correctly uses the opendns server but resolvconf put the dns provided by dhcp in resolv.conf, so pdnsd is bypassed.\nSo, my question is: how can I have resolvconf set resolv.conf to 127.0.0.1 AND pdnsd use opendns server when the request is not cached?\nOne workaround I found is to set, in network manager, \"DHCP (address only)\" for the connection, but the problem with this is that it must be set for every different connection: this means that if you use a laptop you have to change it for every wifi to which you connect!\n\nA: I think I have found myself the solution: adding\nsupersede domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;\n\nto /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf does the job.\nSo maybe it can be useful for someone else if I write my short howto to have pdnsd work in ubuntu with fixed (say, opendns) domain name server, regardless of the used connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable dnsmasq by editing /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and commenting out #dns=dnsmasq\n\n*Force network-manager to set the dns to 127.0.0.1 for every connection by adding\nsupersede domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;\n\nto /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf\n\n*Install pdnsd \n\n*Edit /etc/default/pdnsd and set START_DAEMON=yes\n\n*Configure pdnsd to use your favourite dns.

Its partitions are:\nsda1 - ext4 primary\nsda2 - swap area\nsda3 - NTFS\n\nI found an old HDD that has XP installed on it as the primary (and only) OS. I attached it to my computer (sata1) and it is recognized by the GRUB2 as hd1.\nMy goal is to load the XP OS (without changing the BIOS boot order or reinstalling XP) via the GRUB2 command line/configuration files.\nI entered the GRUB2 command line and tried the following commands:\nset root='(hd1,msdos1)'\ndrivemap -s hd0 hd1\nchainloader +1\n\nThis solution didn't work. It said that the command drivemap doesn't exist and the command chainloader asked for an input file.\nHow can I boot Windows XP (not EFI) using the GRUB2 on another HDD?\n\nA: The error message you're seeing implies that your current setup is in EFI mode. Windows XP, though, does not support booting in EFI mode -- it's a BIOS-only OS. Furthermore, Windows XP has reached end-of-life (EOL) status. The simplest answer to your question is therefore \"forget it.\" You should be able to extract user data from the disk from either a more modern Windows or from Linux. If you really have a compelling need to run Windows XP, I have several suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtualize it -- You can run XP in a virtual machine, such as under VirtualBox. See here for information on how to provide VirtualBox with direct (\"raw\") disk access to boot your existing Windows XP installation.\n\n*Convert it all to BIOS mode -- You can convert all your current OSes to boot in BIOS mode. This will require doing a GPT-to-MBR disk conversion, re-installing GRUB, and either re-installing your existing Windows boot loader or re-installing Windows. This is probably the most difficult transition of the options described here, but it should work smoothly once you're done with it.\n\n*Manually switch boot modes -- Many EFIs provide a built-in boot manager that can switch between EFI-mode and BIOS-mode boots. If you have such a firmware, you should be able to manually switch boot modes by accessing this boot manager. Unfortunately, details vary greatly from one EFI to another, so I can't provide detailed instructions on how to do this.\n\n*Use rEFInd -- My rEFInd boot manager can switch boot modes, but you'll need to edit the refind.conf configuration file: Uncomment the scanfor option and ensure that hdbios is among the options. This feature is very primitive, though; at the moment, it usually works to boot only from the first hard disk, so you may need to swap disk cables or install a BIOS-mode boot loader on the first disk to redirect the boot process to the second disk. Some computers lack the necessary firmware features for rEFInd to work at all in this way.\n\n*Use a second computer -- This is the simplest option. Stick the disk in a second computer and use it.\n\n\nNote also that Windows (even as old as XP) tends to be fussy about its hardware, so it may require several reboots to update its drivers for its new environment. In fact, it probably doesn't even have drivers for modern computers; you may need to get them from your computer's manufacturer -- assuming they even exist! (VirtualBox is likely to be easier this way, because it emulates fairly old hardware.)\n", "Q: Adding an external hard-drive to www folder I have built a basic web server, and everything works fine. I have a external hard drive which I would like to add to my /var/www folder. How should I do this?\n\nA: The most logical answer to your question: I would consider to create a mountpoint /var/ pointing that disc. That way your whole /var/ will be on that disc. That is not adding it to the current /var/www/ though. If the current disc has lots of content in /var/ your new disc if filled with that content already. You could do that following this answer.\nThe 2nd option would be to create a symlink in /var/ to point to the new disc. That way you add the new disc to the current content. But it might spell trouble in the future: not everything seems to understand or to correctly interpret symlinks. Plus you are spreading out your /var/ over 2 discs. So if 1 of the discs breaks the other becomes useless...\nTo offer a possible better option since you asked \"how should I do this\": Apache2 (assuming you use this) works with virtualhosts. That kills the need to store web content in /var/ and you can store it anywhere you want by including a documentroot in any of the virtualhosts. The default one will point to /var/www/ . So you can mount your disc with a name you like (ie. /user27374/) and put your website content into that directory (./var/www/ on that disc). You can keep the current /var/, copy it all over to the new disc (ie /user27374/var/www/), create a 2nd virtualhost that points to this webroot and test your setup while the current one stays active. \nAny of these can be used but the last one I consider the easiest with the least maintenance. But feel free to consider any of the options (or if someone else posts a different one their method :) ).\nMind though that an external disc is not the quickest when loading data and you will need to have it mounted always if you want to use the webserver. \n", "Q: Strange noise in headphones when no sound is played There is a strange noise from my headphones on Lenovo T440.

This happened due to these 2 config options added in /etc/tlp.d/50-estar-default.conf.\nTLP_DEFAULT_MODE=BAT\nTLP_PERSISTENT_DEFAULT=1\n\nThis means, the default mode is battery and this will be persistent all that time. It doesn't change even if you are on AC.\nThis configuration option was added by package oem-fix-misc-cnl-tlp-estar-conf.  The apt-cache show oem-fix-misc-cnl-tlp-estar-conf shows this description\nDescription: customized configuration for tlp.\n This package carrys agressive policy to pass energy-star, and also some blacklist for problematic devices.\n\nNow you know why this happened\n\nA: I don't know if you still have this problem, but for me the solution was to lower the volume of the headset from the physical buttons on it.\nIf your headset has physical volume down buttons, turn the volume down using them.

I wanted to get a look at MySQL 5.6 on Ubuntu 14.04 just out of curiosity. And based on this article it certainly looked like installation should be simple and straightforward. So I fired up an AWS EC2 micro server running Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit), logged into my pristine instance (via PuTTY), and issued the following commands:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get build-dep mysql-server-5.6\n$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.6\n\n(The first two commands were desperation moves, since simply running apt-get install alone had previously not worked.

Though i had the big enough memory 12Gb given to my VM, but still things were failing as in question. After spending some time found that default apt get was missing some of the configuration translation and tool translation packages.\nThe MySQL apt repository provides a simple and convenient way to install and update MySQL products with the latest software packages using apt-get.\nHere is what you have to follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding the MySQL APT Repository\n First, add the MySQL apt repository to your system's software repository list. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the download page for the MySQL apt repository at http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/apt/.\n\n*Select and download the release package.\n\n*Install the downloaded release package with the following command, replacing version-specific-package-name with the name of the downloaded package (preceded by its path, if you are not running the command inside the folder where the package is):    \nsudo dpkg -i /PATH/version-specific-package-name.deb\n\nNote that the same package works on all supported Debian and Ubuntu platforms.\n\n\n*\n\n*During the installation of the package, you will be asked to choose the versions of the MySQL server and other components (for example, the MySQL Workbench) that you want to install. If you are not sure which version to choose, do not change the default options selected for you. You can also choose none if you do not want a particular component to be installed. After making the choices for all components, choose OK to finish the configuration and installation of the release package.\n\n\n\nyou can always change your choices for the versions later;\n  see Selecting a Major Release Version for instructions.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Update package information from the MySQL APT repository with the following command (this step is mandatory):\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n*Installing MySQL with APT\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MySQL by the following command:    \nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nThis installs the package for the MySQL server, as well as the packages for the client and for the database common files.\nDuring the installation, there are two requests by the dialogue boxes: Supply a password for the root user for your MySQL installation.\n\n\n*Starting and Stopping the MySQL Server\n\n\nThe MySQL server is started automatically after installation. \n    - You can check the status of the MySQL server with the following command:  \nsudo service mysql status\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop the MySQL server with the following command:\nsudo service mysql stop\n\n\n*To restart the MySQL server, use the following command:\nsudo service mysql start\n\nI followed this http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-apt-repo-quick-guide/en/#apt-repo-fresh-install. This worked smoothly and downloaded all packages and successfully installed mysql 5.6.\n\nA: I have encounter the same problem when I init my small VPS. The issue is caused by small memory. So without spending extra money to increase the memory which you not needed, you could simply create swap files to aids the installation. Yes the swap is slow, but all you need is get the install done. \nOn Ubuntu 14.04, I do the following to solve the problem:\nCreate a 4G swap file:\nsudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile\n\nChange its permission to only root could access and change:\nsudo chmod 600 /swapfile\n\nMake it swap:\nsudo mkswap /swapfile\n\nActivate:\nsudo swapon /swapfile\n\nNow you can try install mysql again, it should success this time. Just remember to remove the previous unsuccessful installation before you do so.\n\nA: The problem you are having looks the same as this bug report. The failure to start seems to be because the default MySQL 5.6 configuration requires more memory than it can get in your micro instance.\nThe solution to the error appears to be to do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Increase the amount of memory in your EC2 instance\n\n*Set a smaller value for MySQL's max_connections variable\n\n\nA: In my case I've added\ninnodb_buffer_pool_size = 20M\n\nto the /etc/mysql/my.cnf\n\nA: Disabling the performance_schema also saves a lot of memory. My empty database going from 400m to 40m on startup:\nperformance_schema=0\n\nMySQL Docs: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/performance-schema.html\n\nA: I encountered this issue on Ubuntu 15.10. For me it was not a memory issue (I have 2GB ram and 18GB of swap, of which only about 300MB was used in total). \nIn my case, dpkg was looking for /etc/mysql/conf.d, which did not exist (however /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d did!). Reinstalling mysql and manually creating the folder /etc/mysql/conf.d solved my issue.\nHow exactly did this happen? I have no idea. I almost didn't want to share my answer, as I bet this solution is specific to my computer.\nI solved this issue by using the utility strace, which is fantastic for this sort of thing, if incredibly verbose. \nI used it like this: \n\n\n*\n\n*After pressing ctrlc halfway through apt-get install mysql-server, I had to run dpkg --configure -a to finish the installing.\n\n*I ran strace 2>/tmp/trace dpkg --configure -a. That made me a nice strace log at /tmp/trace.\n\n*I looked through the log, especially down the bottom, where it failed.\n\n*I noticed it tried to access /etc/mysql/conf.d, and got the error code ENOENT, no such file or directory.\nFor anyone wanting to give this a go, do the strace 2>/tmp/trace (command) and grep for ENOENT. As I said, this solution is probably specific to my computer, but you might want to give it a go.\n\nA: In my case all I needed to do was make some changes in my.cnf and just delete 2 logs files named ib_logfile0 and ib_logfile1, and start mysql \nservice mysql start\n\nNo need to reinstall mysql, just delete these 2 log files and restart mysql server \nBelow changes I made in my.cnf:\nmax_connections     = 1000     \nmax_allowed_packet  = 1024M\nwait_timeout        = 7200 \n\n", "Q: Cannot start nautilus or any other app via gksu anymore I am running Ubuntu 14.04 64bit on my Dell XPS 13 laptop, and up until now I was able to start nautilus via terminal or by using ALT+F2 and typing gksu nautilus through Dash.

The details may vary depending on the guest OS but this will always allow you to install Guest Additions, whatever the guest happens to be.\n\nA: I'd suggest to update the Guest additions with the VM package manager.\nSo login first into your VM and open a Terminal to type:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11\n\nFinally restart the VM to complete the installation.\nYou should get higher resolutions using the guest additions provided by the packages.\n\nA: This made (installing the guest additions) simple and quick for me..\nhttps://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=15679\n", "Q: Which diashow viewer has a shuffle functionality?

I'll leave that question for its value, maybe someone else has the same problem, and maybe he'll find a solution by reading this post.\n\nA: This is a bug in libtar 1.2.20-3 as patched by Debian and Ubuntu. The original libtar 1.2.20 doesn't show this bug. Providing a target directory that is different from the current directory results in SIGSEGV. This bug can be easily reproduced with the libtar example program : libtar -C /tmp/target_dir -x -z default.vlt\n", "Q: Can I use xdotool as an auto-clicker? Is there a way I can use xdotool to perform a certain number of mouse clicks per second while holding down a certain key?\n\nA: This is my bash script for xdotool. You can set it with a keyboard shortcut. It stops when you move the mouse. Of course you can make your own script to fit your tastes.\n#!/bin/bash\neval $(xdotool getmouselocation --shell)\necho $X $Y\nx1=$X\ny1=$Y\nCOUNTER=1\nCOUNTEND=100000\n#REPEAT= 0.09s\nwhile [ $COUNTER -lt $COUNTEND ]; do\n  echo the counter is $COUNTER\n  xdotool click 1\n  eval $(xdotool getmouselocation --shell)\n  # cancel if mouse moved\n  if [ $x1 != $X ] || [ $y1 != $Y ]; then\n    echo Mouse moved - script terminated\n    exit 1\n  fi\n  #this sleep works for repetition rate\n  sleep 0.01s\n  let COUNTER=COUNTER+1\n#  xdotool click --delay 90 --repeat 1000 1\ndone\n\n\nA: Partial answer. First, you have to bind your key to run code. The easiest way IMHO to do that is with AutoKey which provides that feature along with a whole lot of other keyboard automation features.\nOnce that's taken care of, then you just write a very small keyboard macro (in Python) which uses xdotool to issue the mouse event and then sleep for one second divided by the number of events you want per second. The part I'm not sure about is detecting the key release to stop the process, but since the macro is written in Python, almost anything should be possible.\nBecause the code takes time to run, etc., this will not be precisely so many per second and you'll have to adjust the sleep time accordingly. The clicks will not be perfectly equally spaced for the same reasons as well as things like system load.\nFor most practical applications, an approach like this should be \"good enough\".\nIf this sounds like it would work for you, then we could get deeper into the actual implementation on or off forum.\n", "Q: No printer icon in Ubuntu 14.04 system settings When I Upgraded from 12.04 I had a problem booting till I changed RO to RW in boot files. But my current problem is that I cannot see a printer icon in system settings, and How do I fix it.\n\nA: The Printers entry into Unity is provided by file /usr/share/applications/system-config-printer.desktop.\nIts content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Printers\nComment=Configure printers\nExec=system-config-printer\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=printer\nStartupNotify=true\nNotShowIn=KDE;GNOME;\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=system-config-printer\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Settings;HardwareSettings;X-GNOME-Settings-Panel;X-Unity-Settings-Panel;System;Printing;\nX-GNOME-Settings-Panel=printing\nX-Unity-Settings-Panel=printing\nKeywords=Printer;Queue;Print;Paper;Ink;Toner;\nX-Desktop-File-Install-Version=0.22\n\nPermissions of the file:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 471 Mar 14 13:19 system-config-printer.desktop\n\nAnd when I asked about this file in packages (dpkg -S system-config-printer.desktop) I got as result:\napp-install-data: /usr/share/app-install/desktop/system-config-printer-gnome:system-config-printer.desktop\nsystem-config-printer-gnome: /usr/share/applications/system-config-printer.desktop\n\nAnd searching by system-config-printer at Synaptic:\n\nSo, maybe if you can check if you have the above packages installed, file in place, correct content/permissions, etc.\n\nA: Even how many weeks after the release of 14.04, there is no update available for this ugly bug.\nThe solution is to install the printer-indicator for Ubuntu 14.10\nJust choose your version and download it here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/utopic/+source/indicator-printers/0.1.7+14.10.20140527-0ubuntu1\nand install by:\nsudo dpkg -i indicator-printers_0.1.7+14.10.20140527-0ubuntu1*.deb\n\nLogout/Login and the printer indicator is back like before.\n\nA: I did all checks suggested by Rael. I found out in the Synaptics that the system-config-printer-gnome was not the same version as the two other file. I marked it up for upgrade and applied the upgrade. Bingo, the printer icon is now in the Settings screen.\n\nA: In my case it was that I have removed the cups service by accident, you can reinstall it by sudo apt-get install cups and the printer setting icon appear again in the system settings panel, or if you cups service exists, you may try just install sudo apt install   system-config-printer-gnome.

The outputs you had was identical in all ways possible, only thing was he didn't have the issue during update, but rather installation.\nAccording to this post there may be a difference between installing Steam from a PPA, Software Center, Synaptic or official DEB package. Installing it through all those sources you can be successful, according to the post.\nAnother very common issue is that the graphics drivers are \"incorrect\". Speaking from own experience, changing drivers and reinstalling can solve the issue. By changing I mean switch from Open Sourced drivers to Closed and vise versa.\nWhen reinstalling Steam, if you don't want to delete your game data you should be able to follow ChrisR's suggestion of saving the SteamApps folder and then replace the new contents with your old save.\nP.S. I apologize as this maybe should have been posted like a comment. The thing is, I don't have enough rep for that so I hope you'll except my vague attempt to an answer :)\n\nA: This is a Community Wiki answer of the OP's answer which was in the question.\n\n\nI had to change my display server to Xorg. When I did, Steam opened and downloaded the update.\nI went back to fglrx and steam is now working.\n\n\nA: When I had this problem in the past (refusing to upgrade steam), I had to completely reinstall steam.  You can save your currently installed Steam games by going into:\n[name of steam folder]/SteamApps\n\nand saving everything inside that folder.  Once you reinstall steam, just copy the contents back into the same directory (e.g. Steam/SteamApps).  Then, restart Steam and you should be good to go.\n", "Q: No sound from Chrome, sound works fine in Firefox etc (13.10) I'm running 13.10 (all up-to-date) on a Lenovo laptop with a Griffin iMic USB audio device. Though I occasionally have to use the Pulse Audio volume control tool to re-select the iMic, it works consistently from everything on the system except Chrome, which basically has no audio at all.\nWith most applications that want to use the audio stuff, you see something in the first tab of pavucontrol. Not Chrome; there's just nothing.\nSome ancient forum posts here and there suggested symlinking the Firefox \"plugins\" directory over to Chrome's installation directory, which seems pretty goofy and which doesn't work now anyway.\nChrome version is 34.0.1847.132.\nIs there some trick to making Chrome work with a USB audio device? (As far as I can tell it doesn't work with built-in audio either ...)\nedit — Still not working, now on 14.04 and Chrome 37.0.2062.120\nMore info:\nChrome's been reinstalled more than once, with no effect. I've also tried the beta (currently Chrome 38.0.2125.77 beta). The PulseAudio manager tool, in its list of clients, shows Firefox and various other things, and also \"Chrome input\" but no \"Chrome output\".\nChromium behaves exactly the same way.\nedit — now on an (old and tired) 15.04 installation. Chrome (Version 49.0.2623.112 (64-bit)) still does not work, though on full moon nights or something else random it'll send sound through the built-in analog audio on the laptop. However, Chromium (Version 48.0.2564.82 Ubuntu 15.04 (64-bit)) does work now, and it works through the USB audio device. I don't know of any particular thing I've done lately to make that true, but \n\nA: Before wiping out the entire Chrome configuration directory, try this: switch to another audio output device and then switch back to the original one. If you have only one audio device, connect an external one (like HDMI or USB audio) and then perform the above trick.\nUpdate\nThe following seems to prevent the problem from reappearing in the future:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/pulse/default.pa, find the line that starts with load-module module-stream-restore and add restore_device=false at the end so that the line looks like this:\nload-module module-stream-restore restore_device=false\n\n*Do killall pulseaudio\n\nA: This work for me (Ubuntu 14.04):\nkillall pulseaudio\nrm -r ~/.config/pulse/*\nrm -r ~/.pulse*\n\nAnd reboot. \nThese commands will stop pulseaudio and remove its current configuration, to start with the defaults again.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. My laptop had two sound cards, one for built-in audio from the laptop speakers, the other to come through the hdmi output. When I was playing music or something that used the browsers sound, it was channeling the sound through the hdmi channel. From the kmix sound manager, I could see that chrome was listed in the playback streams but if you right clicked on the chrome icon and select move, there was an option to change the audio output for the stream. I made sure it wasn't hdmi, since I wanted the sound to come from my speakers or headphones.\n\nA: None of the above worked form, been without sound in chrome for a week. Then I started SMplayer, no sound also, Options>Pregerences>Audio switched from pulseaudio to alsa.\nNext time I started chrome sound works.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  It ended up being that my system was trying to put Chrome's sound through the HDMI even though the HDMI chord was not plugged in at the time.  Presumably, this could happen with any audio output device.  The sound settings Ubuntu offers didn't show this nor let me change it for the individual application, but pavucontrol did.\nTo install pavucontrol from the Terminal:\nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\nTo open pavucontrol from the Terminal:\npavucontrol\n\nSelect the \"Playback\" menu and make sure that you have it set to Show Applications.  Now, start playing something from Google Chrome.  It will show up there, and it will show what output device is being used for Google Chrome.  Make sure it is set to the output device you are trying to use.\n\nA: Chrome comes with an integrated flash player and it does not always work well.\nIf you have sound with Firefox on websites like youtube or deezer, maybe you already have a Flash player on your system: the package \"flashplugin-installer\".\nIf not:\nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\nThen, you can set which Flash player you want in Chrome's plugins setting:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a new tab, type chrome://plugins instead of a URL\n\n*click on details on the right,\n\n*select Adobe Flash Player\n\n*you will see two different \"sub\" plugins\n\n*disable the current one and enable the other one\n\n*restart Chrome\n\n\nYou can also find a short video about how to do it with on Chrome for Windows, this is the same way in Ubuntu:\nhttp://youtu.be/cDgwNzEFuFY\n\nA: Check you are running the right architecture of Chrome.\nI had i386 Chrome installed on a 64 bit system and had this issue.  When I uninstalled and installed the 64bit version, audio worked fine.\n\nA: I had the same problem you may not notice any issue immediately after i install chrome-remote-desktop problem occurs after i reboot my pc. so following worked for me.\nI am using : Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\n\n  \n*\n  \n*sudo apt-get autoremove chrome-remote-desktop\n  \n*killall pulseaudio\n  rm -r ~/.config/pulse/*\n  rm -r ~/.pulse*\n  \n\ncopy and past each line in the terminal.\nHope it helps \n\nA: A simple reinstall of Chrome worked for me on Ubuntu 14.04.\nsudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable --reinstall\n\nA: Yesterday you might have simply right-clicked a tab, and selected \"Mute site\", and forgot about it.

I have looked at previous questions but did not find an answer to this seeming anomoly.  Thanks.\nThe other thing is being a newbie I hope I can find my question post again if there is a reply - not at all certain about this but have ticked the email reply box at least.\n\nA: ~/Downloads is a directory, not a file. It simply points to the list of files that directory contains (i.e., the files you downloaded). ls gives you the size of that pointer, which is usually 4k. \nWhen you view that directory in a file explorer, the program assumes you want the total size of files within that directory. You can get this from the command line, too, of course - try du -hs Downloads.\nSee this post for more info. \n", "Q: Putting Internal Hard Drive in another PC If I install Ubuntu on my current hard-drive, where this computer and the other computer are 64 bit, would this hard-drive work if I put it in the other computer? I know Microsoft OS doesn't allow that, so I'd like to know if Ubuntu is the same. They're both SATA.\n\nA: It's a game of chance, and depends on how dissimilar the hardware is. Most of the time it will boot up and simply detect the new hardware as if they were system upgrades, but there are some circumstances where you might have problems.\nGraphics Drivers: If you've installed any graphics drivers and the systems don't use the same driver you might get a blank screen. If you are just using the default Ubuntu drivers then you should be fine. I'm referring more to packages you install like fglrx-updates etc.\nNetworking: You'll have a different network interface, and so it may require you to reconfigure it by hand.

I use it a lot when I'm working with several tabs opened on the browser, and I just want to detach one the tabs and throw in away in the other screen.\nI'd really be happy if there is a built-in or external program\\option to tweak the does this in Ubuntu (14.04). I really would like it to allow the \"drop\" of the window anywhere on the screen (just like I do in Windows...), and not just sticking it to the top, which is the default way of achieving that.\n\nA: I am not sure if this works with Ubuntu's Unity desktop, or if it's exactly what you are looking for but Using XFCE based Ubuntu distributions (Xubuntu and Ubuntu Studio.), you can do very much the same thing. If you grab the top bar of the window you can drag it to another display or even desktop, if you push the top bar to the top of that display then it will snap maximized to that display.\n", "Q: How to tell if battery is dead using Ubuntu Today I found an old ASUS UL30A laptop collecting dust in my office. The hard drive was missing and it seems the battery is dead, but I just so happened to have an Ubuntu USB stick lying around so I plugged in the power cord and brought it to life. Power Statistics is showing the following info for the battery:\n\nMy question is what, exactly, does this mean? I suppose the battery is dead, but is this a situation where I can just buy a replacement battery, or does this indicate that something in the chain from charger to battery is genuinely damaged? I should mention that, regardless of how long I leave it on the charger, the laptop immediately dies when I unplug it.\nThanks!\n\nA: The battery is certainly dead.

Then click the little keyboard icon to open the Russian window and display the Russian keyboard layout. Is the Russian keyboard layout displayed in the Russian window? If the Russian keyboard layout isn't displayed in the Russian window, you can add it by clicking on the plus button (+) to open the Choose an input source window, selecting the Russian language from the list of keyboard input languages, and then clicking the Add button to add the Russian keyboard layout.\n\nIf this doesn't work, then there is another possibility. Did the Panel language switcher icon work properly in the beginning? If so, did you ever have boot problems with your computer and then used the startx command to start the X.Org X Window System?\n\nA: The solution for the same problem which worked on Gnome 15.04 is a workaround from here. So on 14.04 use at your own risk:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \"[]\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-input-source \"['<Alt>Shift_L']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-input-source-backward \"['<Alt>Shift_R']\"\n\n\nA: In the Text Entry click under the \"Switch to next source using\" and then type the shortcut that you want.

Though it is not recommended to start using Emacs with it.\nPersonally I'd recommend customize Emacs to fit Your needs step-by-step. No one really knows what You want Emacs to be. But Emacs allows almost any kind of configuration. You can cast each of Your requirenments to a separate stackexchange question -- Ask Ubuntu, StackOverflow or SuperUser -- depending on the feature.\n\nA: The “Use CUA keys” setting, available under the Options menu in GNU Emacs 24, provides at least the keyboard shortcuts part of what you're asking for.\n\nA: You may want to look into Spacemacs where thought was put into a better and powerful user experience.\n\nA: Aquamacs is an Emacs clone for OS X, the about page makes it very clear:\n\nAquamacs is an Aqua-native build of the powerful Emacs text editor. By\n  \"Aqua-native,\" we mean more than just the fact that this version of\n  Emacs runs as a standard OS X application.  Aquamacs features\n  extensive customization: it will feel and behave mostly like an Aqua\n  program - while still being a real GNU Emacs with all the ergonomy and\n  extensibility you've come to expect from this world-class editor.\n[...] Aquamacs is a modern editor based on GNU Emacs that makes the\n  Mac user feel at home. For instance, in addition to traditional Emacs\n  shortcuts like C-x C-f (open a new file), Aquamacs understands\n  Command-O.\n\nMeaning that the extra functionality provided by the Aquamacs build is specifically directed at OS X and will not function (or even make sense) on other systems.\nInstead of an alternative you should simply go for the real thing - available from the Software Centre. \n", "Q: How do I create a multi-bootable SD card? I am looking to make a backup & rescue micro-SD card for Microsoft Surface Pro 2 which has a micro-SD slot built-in. I probably won't be able to choose just one solution to use as a rescue disk, and will want to create a Multi-Boot disk.\nI need to use flash card as a multi-bootable disk that I can also put disk image backups and other data on. I will at least need to back up a Windows 8.1 installation.\nThere are a lot of questions and tutorials for making (multi-)boot CDs/DVDs. What do I need to know about flash cards specifically, in comparison to CDs/DVDs? In particular, which filesystem and bootloader will I need to use; is anything else specific to flash cards?\nI prefer an open-source cross-platform solution.\n\nA: I think the real problem with this is that the Surface tablets use UEFI, so it is a more involved process to boot other OS's on them.  There is no real difference between using UFD and SD cards for boot devices.  Just format the SD card as FAT32 and follow the instructions for making a UFD multiboot disk.  However, the real limitation comes with UEFI and making a disk that will work for that.\nYour best bet for using Linux would be to install Ubuntu (or some other *nix OS) to the SD card itself using a generic driver install (contains drivers for all known hardware).  This would be portable in a sense, but you could run into some trouble as this is not a live install.  \nThe only other option is to use rEFInd (download it and extract the files to the SD card.  Then put a Live ISO (or several Live ISOs) on the SD card.  It should(tm) be able to boot them.\n", "Q: Slow connection with a Broadcom BCM4318 wireless card I recently upgraded to 14.04. I just recently had an issue where my wifi wouldn't connect. I restarted the computer and it connected fine but now my wifi speeds are extremely slow. I saw a similar issue posted that said to use a script to provide info, which I've provided below. Where should I go from here?\nhttp://pastie.org/9125814\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: It might be helpful to enter the following command serveral times over a few minutes to find out at what rate you are connecting and whether it is the same or if it is changing.\niwlist wlan0 rate \n\nHave you moved your system farther from the wireless access point since you upgraded? \nAlso the greater the distance or density of obstructions the lower the data rate. \nInterference from other access points can also lower the data rate.\nIf the data rate is consistently good it might be a coincidence between the Ubuntu update and something going wrong in your path to the speedtest site, or something in your hardware. To eliminate these try a different speedtest location and a different computer.\nPerhaps easier would be to test the non-coincidence case. Boot your computer from a 14.04 DVD and from a DVD for the last Ubuntu you were running and run the speedtest from each.\n", "Q: Does Xubuntu Include Proprietary Software? I am interested in installing Xubuntu 14.04 on my computer, but I was wondering whether or not it comes pre-installed with copyrighted proprietary software such as codecs, Flash, drivers, etc.?\nI know you can install them through the ubuntu-restricted-extras package, or by checking \"Install Third-Party Software,\" but I know some of the Ubuntu family includes codecs and things by default. So, my question is, does Xubuntu come with codecs/proprietary software other than the ones in restricted-extras or through the installer?\n\nA: No version of Ubuntu includes proprietary software, at least not in essence. Proprietary software included are modules for certain graphics cards and wireless adapters but nothing else. You wont find codecs nor plugins, as they go against the distribution policies of said packages.\n", "Q: Dual boot Windows XP and Ubuntu 14.04 I'm new at Linux, and I decided to try Ubuntu.

This just means that you will split (i.e., partition) your harddrive into two sections, one for Windows, and one for Ubuntu. Then, when your computer starts, you will have the option to select which partition to boot to. (This is exactly the concept behind dual-booting.)\n\nA: The windows xp support is ending now . I unfortunately feel that I have to use windows too sometimes . I run virtualbox with windows xp . I use 10GB of my disk which is partitions of linux , everything around it is xt4 . I believe you minimize vulnerabilities and you don’t have to sacrifice much . I recommend it , if of course your computer can take it. You can set the virtual machine as you wish ( set 2 cores and at 512 M ram , its a good start ) . You can find awesome tutorials about that matter .

I just removed that from my config file and it put my conky display overtop anything below it (and hence I can't \"click-through\").\n", "Q: Using Windows programs or alternatives? I am an advanced beginner who has been tempted to try Ubuntu by two friends who program.\nMy major question is about using Windows programs. The ones I use most are Quicken, Family Tree Maker, Last Pass, and Dragon Speech.  \nWill these work in Ubuntu or are there alternatives?\n\nA: first Last Pass has a native Linux version.\nMost Windows Programs can be run using Wine which you can install from the Ubuntu software Center.\nTo check which programs will run on Wine on Ubuntu you search the program's name on this site Wine App Database\nMost version of Quicken and Dragon Speech run pretty well under Wine, I'd recommend 12.0 Premium of Dragon Speech, though if you're looking for an alternative to Dragon speech you might view this question or perhaps Julius, see here.\nFor Family Tree maker the 2005 version appears to work well under Wine. In addition there are many alternatives that might work well, these include gramps lifelines, and geneweb.\n\nA: First, using VirtualBox you can run Windows and on an Ubuntu desktop. You can find more info to see if your favorite programs and devices are supported at https://www.virtualbox.org/.\nNext, If you already have Windows on your computer, you should probably just consider installing Ubuntu on the same hard drive next to Windows. That way, if you ever want to use Windows, just reboot your PC.\nThe option to install Ubuntu \"along side\" or \"along with\" your current OS is suggested to the user during a regular installation from a LiveDVD or USB. Ubuntu installs the Grub2 bootloader that allows you to select operating systems when you boot your computer after installation.\nThere are dozens of youtube videos that show this process step by step.\nUpdate I did some checking on dragon and found some info here (http://thenerdshow.com/platypus.html)[http://thenerdshow.com/platypus.html] I haven't used it but platypus is supposed to allow dragon give keyboard commands when running in a virtual environment and even Wine as well.\nsource: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition_software_for_Linux#cite_note-2)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition_software_for_Linux#cite_note-2]\nSimon is also a linux alternative for speech recognition to check out.\nFinally if you feel up to it you can code your own software using the dragonfly python module. Dragonfly appears to be a promising tool that supports D.N.S. and many other voice rec. technologies.

To do this, try typing: \ntelnet server_ip 22 \n\nwhere 22 is the default port of the ssh protocol. If the port is different, you must change it. \nIf the server replies to you, you can connect this way: \nssh <username>@server_ip -p 22 \n\n is the user who has permission to access the server via ssh. \nThe -p 22 argument can omit it if the port is the default, or if you use a different port you have to use it.\n", "Q: How to automate the process of executing a command upon creation of a file How to automate the process of executing a command upon creation of a file.\nI have an application wherein a tool generates an xsd schema from a xml file. My next module uses this xsd schema for further processing.\nI want to automate this process i.e. to run a command once the file is generated. This application will run everyday on ubuntu machine so I want to automate it. I don't want any human intervention in this process.\nI did search inotify lib which is used for similar purposes but it forces me to change the enitre design of my system.\nAre there any other alternatives which would solve this purpose? Any help is highly appreciated. \n\nA: Figuring out when the file is finished being written is the hard part. It is best to use a script like:\n#!/bin/sh\nprogram-that-creates-xsd\nprogram-that-does-further-processing\n\nThere really aren't any good solutions if you can't structure your program like this. Even with inotify, it is nearly impossible to tell when the XSD is truly finished.\n\nA: Detecting file creation in a specific folder can be done via inotifywait which is part of inotify-tools package installable via sudo apt-get install inotify-tools. \nAs an example, we can establish a continuous watch (-m flag) on directory Desktop and parse the output for created directory entries, however determining if a file is regular file and filename is the one we need has to be done manually:\ninotifywait -m --format \"%f\" -e create ./Desktop/  | \nwhile read -r fname; do \n    [ -f ./Desktop/\"$fname\" ] && [ \"$fname\" = \"specific.csv\" ] && echo \"We got 'em!\" \ndone\n\nSo in case someone makes directory specific.csv that should be rejected, but if specific.csv is created we will execute echo portion, which could be replaced with other commands or shell functions. If you do need a non-blocking execution, you might consider adding setsid to start the command in new session and let the script continue watching. \n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 8 I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my pre-installed windows 8 Lenovo G580.

As a regular user, there is no need for the combined, the home folder cant be accessed in any way before the disk is decrypted, using full disk encryption and a strong passphrase will protect your private information sufficiently. \n", "Q: What is the terminal command for launching a web app?

I'm using 14.04 LTS and my problem was apparently that the server name I was using to address the git repo was actually an alias in the DNS server for another server name.  When I used the other server name, I had no problems, and I did not need to install a cert or change anything on the server side.\n", "Q: How can I install ubuntu one after upgrading to ubuntu 14.04? I upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 without realizing that the ubuntu one package was going to be removed (my fault). I know the ubuntu one service is being discontinued but I'd like to keep on using it at least until I have time to look for something else to replace it. Is there a way to install ubuntu one again on ubuntu 14.04?\nThanks!\n\nA: Neither the ubuntuone-client, nor the ubuntuone-control-panel packages are available for Ubuntu 14.04 from the repositories. Considering how close we are to the shut down of the service you should take this opportunity to find an alternative right away.\n", "Q: What problems can I expect using a 13.10 saucy repository in 14.04 trusty? I just installed VirtualBox 4.3.10 for Linux following the instructions that I found at this site, but the latest repository available is for Ubuntu 13.10, not Ubuntu 14.04. This is the source that I appended to my /etc/apt/sources.list\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian saucy contrib\n\nI tried to just replace the word saucy with trusty, but that repository is not found it gives a 404 error. However, I was able to use the saucy source and every thing seems to be working properly so far. The installation went smoothly. I do plan on checking periodically to see when VirtualBox does update to trusty source so that I can get rid of the saucy source.\nMy main question here is this going to cause me any serious problems later on, or does it really not matter too much? \n\nUpdate: No longer a problem.\nThe VirturalBox web site has now made their update to trusty 14.04 repository.\n\nA: I guess it will be safe to assume that at least until an newer repository becomes available it will be safe for me to use the older version.\n", "Q: 13.10->14.04 upgrade hangs on mdadm configure I have a Ubuntu 13.10 Server installation.
