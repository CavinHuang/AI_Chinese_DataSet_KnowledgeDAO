["Q: Joining an Ubuntu 14.04 machine to active directory with realm and sssd I've tried following this guide to set up realmd and sssd with active directory: http://funwithlinux.net/2014/04/join-ubuntu-14-04-to-active-directory-domain-using-realmd/\nWhen I run the command realm –verbose join domain.company.com –user-principal=c-u14-dev1/nwalke@DOMAIN.COMPANY.COM –unattended everything seems to connect.

Keep in mind that if there is a user on the local system and domain server, the local user will take priority.\n", "Q: How to access the UEFI firmware settings? (aka BIOS) When trying to install Ubuntu on a UEFI-capable computer that came with Windows 8 preinstalled there is no indication like on previous computers (eg. \"Press F2 to enter setup\") when to access the BIOS to change the boot order or boot from external media.\nIt just displays the manufacturer logo when pushing the power button and the next that comes on screen is Windows. So it seems to boot directly to Windows.\nI'm not even seeing the Windows 8 boot splash – like below – just the manufacturer's logo.\n\n\nA: \nSo it seems to boot directly to Windows.\n\nNo, it does not directly boot to Windows 8.\nIf you shut down your computer properly (no standby), it should boot like any other computer before, including performing a power-on self-test (POST). The only difference is, that UEFI machines can perform this whole process much faster.\nBranding = Confusion\nA source of confusion may be branding, because computers that come with UEFI and a preinstalled copy of Windows 8 have a consistent branding during boot, which means that these machines just display one high-resolution splash image, where there would have previously been several pixelated or blurry images until the Windows boot splash appeared.\nManufacturers today use branding to blend in the device pre-boot sequence with the Windows 8 boot process. Correct, the memorable boot splash has been mostly replaced by branding, but you can still identify that the Windows 8 boot process has taken over when the spinning dots appear:\n\nHere is a post by Hans de Goede explaining steps required to achieve flickerfree boot on Fedora\nEntering the firmware settings menu, aka BIOS\nSo to be clear: there still is something like the \"BIOS\". It may look very fancy on some models, but it's still the same and can be accessed by pressing a certain key during the boot sequence. Unless you are using a Chromebook or any other device that deliberately is not compatible to PC clone standards and does not ship with a firmware settings menu.\nYou should consult the manual for your device to find the right key. Even when the manual is on poor technical and more lifestyle level, you may still find a section with instructions for how to boot from external media. It's usually F12, but it can also be a proprietary button like the Novo button which is placed next to the power connector on some models.\nIn case you may find that accessing the menu with the key is still too hard or unreliable, even while spamming the key the whole time after pressing the power button – you have to press the button in the right timeframe – there is another option by telling the operating system or boot loader (GRUB, rEFInd, gummiboot) to boot into the firmware settings menu.\nFrom within Windows 8\nIt's possible from within Windows 8/8.1, have a look at the Windows Startup Settings article on the Windows site for more details.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Windows 8 go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*General > Advanced startup\n\n\n*In Windows 8.1 go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*PC settings > Update & Recovery > Recovery > Advanced startup\n\n\n*Which will take you to a blue screen... with options to choose from.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose an option > Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > UEFI Firmware Settings\n\n", "Q: How to Connect/Disconnect to WiFi Via Terminal I just have a quick question that I have been researching for a while now...\nHow do you connect/disconnect to a wifi network in ubuntu via terminal? I tried several commands that failed. I have been troubleshooting this for about 55 minutes now, and the question still continues to baffle me. \nFYI, I am using wlan0\nThanks Ubuntu :)\nP.S. If I can provide any additional info, don't hesitate to ask.\n\nA: If you are using the desktop versions, the nmcli command for Network Manager could be useful:\nnmcli nm wifi [on|off]\nnmcli dev wifi [list [iface <iface>] [bssid <BSSID>]]\nnmcli dev wifi connect <(B)SSID> [password <password>] [wep-key-type key|phrase] [iface <iface>] [bssid <BSSID>] [name <name>] [--private] [--nowait] [--timeout <timeout>]\nnmcli dev disconnect iface <iface> [--nowait] [--timeout <timeout>]\nnmcli con up id <id> | uuid <id> [iface <iface>] [ap <BSSID>] [--nowait] [--timeout <timeout>]\nnmcli con down id <id> | uuid <id>\n\nIn order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable and enable the WiFi.\n\n*List available networks (specific to a wireless device and the BSSID (usually the MAC address of the AP)).\n\n*Connect to a network, (use password for WPA/WPA2, wep-key-type for WEP).\n\n*Disconnect the device and prevent it from automatically connecting again.\n\n*Activate an existing connection. The id is usually the name of the file in /etc/Network-Manager/system-connections corresponding to the connection. The UUID is available in the same file.\n\n*Deactivate an active connection.\n\n", "Q: Configuring arrow keys on media I just installed Ubuntu and I'm extremely happy about it, I can see myself switching to Linux from Windows permanently.\nThere's a slight problem however, when I'm watching a movie, arrow keys skip forward by 1 minute. Is it possible to configure this?\nIf so, how?\n\nA: If you're talking about the default video player (called Gnome Videos (was Totem)), this feature is in the Wishlist category. It's marked In Progress after about 4 years, so there's no telling when it might actually arrive. It's not going to happen. According to Bastien Nocera [totem developer]:\n\nI don't want to see options like that in Totem. FWIW, use Shift+Left Arrow if\n  you want to skip back by 5 seconds.\n... I rejected a patch to make the arrow keys skip time configurable.\n\nIf you do wish to configure, you might want to look at alternatives such as VLC, SMPlayer, etc. \nIn VLC, the option is available, but hidden away. Go to the Tools menu and open Preferences. In the bottom-left corner, change Show Settings from Simple to All, and search for hotkeys:\n\nSet the jump lengths to the duration you want (in seconds).\nYou can also change the shortcuts for the jumps. (This option is also available in the Simple interface under the Hotkeys section - only the jump duration needs the advanced view.)\n", "Q: Installing LMMS 1.0.3 on Ubuntu I'm having problems installing LMMS using cmake.

How can I fix this problem?\nI tried install compiz-config-settings-manager and enable the unity plugin, but still doesn't fix the problem.\nAfter install the nvidia driver, if I use Intel GPU, everything is fine, but as soon as I switch to Nvidia GPU and reboot it shows black screen, if I try logout/login the screen freeze.\nIf I type: lspci | grep -i vga it shows:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 06)\n\nand\n/usr/bin/nvidia-detector\n\nshows\nnone\n\nand \nlspci | grep -i NV\n\nshows:\n01:00.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK208M [GeForce GT 740M] (rev a1)\n\nand I found out there is no /etx/X11/xorg.conf file exist so I run nvidia-xconfig to create one and select nvidia GPU then reboot, but still no luck, then I run prime-select intel switch to intel GPU and startup, the /etx/X11/xorg.conf missing again\n$ sudo prime-switch nvidia\nrmmod: ERROR: Module nvidia is not currently loaded\n\nI have report this bug on launchpad.net:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-331/+bug/1362848\nif this bug also effects you ,please go there and click \"This bug effects me\" on top of the page.\nThanks\n\nA: Because it's a relatively old post, I'm not sure if the problem still exists, but I still will provide a possible solution.\nIt seems you have both graphics adapters from nvidia and intel, which is called nvidia optimus.\nSo you might want to look at the package bumblebee, which was written for this.\n sudo apt-get install bumblebee \n(type the above in a terminal, shortkey ctrl-alt-t)To use it, you have to provide optirun in front of the executable program (for instance in front of the executable in a terminal) to be able to use the graphic power of the nvidia card. Else, the intel igp will be used.\n", "Q: Terminal flashing between current and previous screen I just upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04. After upgrading the terminal will sometimes, but not always, flash between the current screen and the previous screen. Here are some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*The output of an 'ls' command will flash on and off the screen.\n\n*But when I press enter to start a new line, sometimes--but not always--the output of ls will stop flashing and instead the newline will begin flashing.\n\n*Sometimes vim will start flashing between the current place and a previous place, such as right after a search.\n\n*This also happens when I opened just sh within a bash terminal. (I was hoping the issue was just with my .bashrc, though I haven't changed it in months and didn't have any issues in 12.04.) \n\n\nThis is incredibly annoying, and has made the terminal essentially unusable.Unfortunately, google-ing for a half hour hasn't shown anyone running into similar problems, either on 14.04, other versions of ubuntu,or other versions of linux.\nUPDATE: I'm not sure if this helps identify the problem, but the text stopped blinking when I turned the cursor blinking off using these instructions How do I disable the blinking cursor in gnome-terminal?. However the problem isn't totally fixed because now the text will disappear for a moment when I type.\n\nA: It's possible this is a compiz/nvidia bug.\nI noticed very similar \"screen flashing\" that seemed tied to screen redraws, e.g. chunks of the screen would redraw strangely as the cursor blinked, or if I turned off the blinking cursor, would just fail to redraw at the right time.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/1314367/ describes the following workaround:\n\nTo fix it, you get CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm) and you go\n  down to \"Workarounds\" in the \"Utility\" Category and check the box that\n  says \"Force full screen redraws (buffer swap) on repaint\".\n\n...which seems to have worked for me. At least for now.\n\nA: Many years later I've started getting this same issue after upgrading from Ubuntu 18.04 to Ubuntu 20.04. It's happening with Regolith desktop and gnome terminal located at /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator.\nFixed by installing the old st terminal with apt install stterm and then changing my ~/.config/regolith/i3/config file to launch /usr/bin/st when pressing $mod+Return instead of x-terminal-emulator.\n", "Q: Sound not working HDA-Intel Ubuntu 14.04 Tried all the other \"sound not working\" posts i think, lost count.\npurge/reinstall alsa and pulse, reboot, add user to audio group, various lines in the alsa config file such as \"options snd-hda-intel model=\" then tried different options like generic, auto, basic, default, etc. tried pulseaudio -k && sudo alsa force-reload a few times, with and without rebooting.\nHardware: 16gb ram, core I7-4790, Intel Haswell mboard with onboard sound and graphics\nMultimedia: Audio Adapter: HDA-Intel-HDA Intel HDMI\nOS: Ubuntu server 14.04 with ubuntu-desktop installed.\nGUI\nsound settings lists only the dummy sound card\nalsamixer -c 0\n│ Card: HDA Intel HDMI                                 F1:  Help               │\n│ Chip: Intel Haswell HDMI                             F2:  System information │\n│ View: F3:[Playback] F4: Capture  F5: All             F6:  Select sound card  │\n│ Item: S/PDIF                                                                 │\n│                                     ┌──┐                                     │\n│                                     │OO│                                     │\n│                                     └──┘                                     │\n│                                  < S/PDIF >                                  │\n\naplay -l\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: HDMI [HDA Intel HDMI], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\nSubdevices: 1/1\nSubdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\naplay -L\ndefault\n    Playback/recording through the PulseAudio sound server\nnull\n    Discard all samples (playback) or generate zero samples (capture)\npulse\n    PulseAudio Sound Server\nhdmi:CARD=HDMI,DEV=0\n    HDA Intel HDMI, HDMI 0\n    HDMI Audio Output\ndmix:CARD=HDMI,DEV=3\n    HDA Intel HDMI, HDMI 0\n    Direct sample mixing device\ndsnoop:CARD=HDMI,DEV=3\n    HDA Intel HDMI, HDMI 0\n    Direct sample snooping device\nhw:CARD=HDMI,DEV=3\n    HDA Intel HDMI, HDMI 0\n    Direct hardware device without any conversions\nplughw:CARD=HDMI,DEV=3\n    HDA Intel HDMI, HDMI 0\n    Hardware device with all software conversions\n\ncat /proc/asound/cards\n 0 [HDMI           ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel HDMI\n                      HDA Intel HDMI at 0xf7d14000 irq 46\n\ncat /proc/asound/devices\n  1:        : sequencer\n  2: [ 0- 3]: digital audio playback\n  3: [ 0- 0]: hardware dependent\n  4: [ 0]   : control\n 33:        : timer\nmplayer -ao alsa:device=hdmi /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/system-ready.ogg\nMPlayer 1.1-4.8 (C) 2000-2012 MPlayer Team\nmplayer: could not connect to socket\nmplayer: No such file or directory\nFailed to open LIRC support.

I am unable to add program icons to the top panel in Gnome Classic. I have tried holding the alt and/or the meta key and right clicking, but get no response. I was able to do this in 12.04.\nDo I need to learn how to do it from a command line?\n\nA: To add icons or app launcher on panel key combination is windows button + Alt + Right Click. A drop down will appear with options to Add to Panel, Properties, Add panel etc.\n\nA: Install gnome-session-flashback.\nUsing either synaptic or type in the terminal sudo apt-get install gnome-session-flashback\nBesides install Metacity. Now log-out and choose from the log-in menu a flashback version, and you can add launchers to the menu bar by alt-right click. \n\nA: Once the gnome-session-flashback is installed and you log out and log in again, not only you can ALT-right click on the top panel (taskbar), you can drag and drop the desired apps from Application to the top panel.\n\nA: Super + Right Click on the panel should work.

In the brctl world, a bridge behaves more like the switch of the networking world.

Common aps and actions use 100% CPU cycles I'm running Lubunto 14.04.1 LTS. PC is a 2004 HP ze4200 laptop: 1.8 ghz Celeron M with 1 gb RAM and 80 gb drive. Was running fine on WinXP SP3 and I cleaned the drive off to test Lubuntu 14 LTS. No anti-virus is installed yet. I enabled the CPU resource monitor to see how various programs drag the OS.\nUsing Firefox 31 online right now, I see doing basic functions like openning a new tab and scrolling down a page are using 100% CPU time, ocassionally for 10-30 seconds. In fact some pretty basic aps like Leafnote hit 100% for a second. Wordpad never did that. Lubuntu Software Center locks things up at 100% for 10 seconds. Just typing here shows a 60-80% spike every character. Running the mouse around the screen for 10 seconds results in a sustained 100% load during that time. Right now, if I let the PC rest just idling Firefox and not doing anything with it, CPU use bounces from 20-40% all by itself. \nWinXP idles at 2-10% and it's considered not good for it to be above 20%... something odd must be happening. Sure, XP will give similar higher CPU cycles with program use, but it's not locking and slogging like this. \nLubuntu is supposed to be a light OS and by memory usage it is and I'm happy since this is an old PC maxed for memory upgrades. However, being used to doing some tuning and wary of abnormalities going on in the background, the CPU use indicates things going on that I want to know about and perhaps apply a tweek or two. Recommendations are appreciated.\nAnd this 300 point \"new tags\" restriction bites!\n\nA: There are lots of things you can, and need to do, to improve the performance of your system.\nFirst, install thermald to control laptop temperatures:\nsudo apt-get install thermald\n\nMore info can be found here wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagement/ThermalIssues\nNext, install TLP. TLP helps save power and maximize performance. Run these commands to install TLP:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw\n\nYou will need to edit the following file before you start TLP:\nsudo leafpad /etc/default/tlp\n\nGo through the settings and set them accordingly. Most importantly you must set the following line near the beginning of the file:\nTLP_ENABLE=1\n\nEvery line that begins with a \"#\" will not be used by the system so remove any \"#\" to enable a setting or add a \"#\" to the beginning of a line to do the opposite. When you are done, save the file before closing and then run the following command:\nsudo tlp start\n\nMore info can be found here: prevent-your-laptop-from-overheating\nFurthermore, make sure your hardware sensors are properly detected. Install lm-sensors with this command:\nsudo apt-get install lm-sensors\n\nAnd run the following command to properly detect your sensors:\nsudo sensors-detect\n\nFollow the suggestions, accept the defaults if it's \"safe\" and skip anything that \"could be risky\".\nmore: how-to-use-to-use-lm-sensors\nIf you want control over your CPU you can install a frequency scaler:\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nYou may have to search for it in your apps to enable it the first time. I couldn't get it to run on any pentium4 computers but if your celeron is supported, you'll probably appreciate the direct control.\nFinally, look into installing some openGL support. Windows has activeX but linux has openGL to provide hardware acceleration to reduce the load on your CPU by enabling your GPU to do it's job.

I already know that init is the magical program that is needed for booting your computer and managing runlevels, but what is it's real purpose?\nWhy do we even need init in the first place? Why can't the bootloader tell Upstart what programs to run and not run?\nThis question in (late) response to my What would happen if init was deleted? question.\n\nA: See the manual for init on Unix systems.\nThis is a post from the Wikipedia entry on init:\n\nIn Unix-based computer operating systems, init (short for initialization) is the first process started during booting of the computer system. Init is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down. It is the direct or indirect ancestor of all other processes and automatically adopts all orphaned processes. Init is started by the kernel using a hard-coded filename, and if the kernel is unable to start it, a kernel panic will result. Init is typically assigned process identifier 1.\nThe design of init has diverged in Unix systems such as System III and System V, from the functionality provided by the init in Research Unix and its BSD derivatives. The usage on most Linux distributions is somewhat compatible with System V, but some distributions, such as Slackware, use a BSD-style and others, such as Gentoo, have their own customized version.\nSeveral replacement init implementations have been written with attempt to address design limitations in the standard versions. These include launchd, the Service Management Facility, systemd and Upstart, the latter being used by Ubuntu and some other Linux distributions.\n\nHope this helps to explain it to you; it’s a lot of reading.\n\nA: upstart and systemd are init systems. By convention (and perhaps other constraints), the program is still called init, irrespective of whether systemd or upstart or something else is at play. Don't let the process name fool you. PID1 is not SysV init any longer. It hasn't been for quite some time on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Bluetooth automatic mouse connection not working I'd like my HP Bluetooth Mouse x4000b (no usb dongle) to connect automatically when starting my HP laptop (Ubuntu 14.04), but I can't succeed in it : I'm forced to do it manually by clicking the connect button.\nI know this topic has been answered many times, but no solution worked for me.\nHere's what I tried so far :\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating the file /etc/default/bluetooth with lines :\nHIDD_ENABLED=1\nHIDD_OPTIONS=\"--connect F0:65:DD:7D:EC:A0 --server\"\n\n\n*Putting hciconfig hci0 reset at the end of /etc/init.d/bluetooth\n\n*Putting \n/etc/init.d/bluetooth stop\nsleep 1\n/etc/init.d/bluetooth start\n\nin /etc/rc.local\nNone of these solution worked, I've read a lot of topics but couldn't find a solution ... that's why I'm asking that here, hoping you can help me troubleshooting that.\nUpdate:\nray@ray-HP-EliteBook-840-G1:~$ hciconfig \nhci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB\nBD Address: F8:16:54:02:9F:62  ACL MTU: 1021:5  SCO MTU: 96:5\nUP RUNNING PSCAN ISCAN \nRX bytes:4672039 acl:306914 sco:0 events:6516 errors:0\nTX bytes:36591 acl:372 sco:0 commands:401 errors:0\n\nray@ray-HP-EliteBook-840-G1:~$ bluez-simple-agent hci0 F8:16:54:02:9F:62\nCreating device failed: org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed: Page Timeout\n\n\nA: OK To run at start up please, open start up applications from dash and choose new.

I had to learn the hard way. Maybe this isn't helpful just figured I'd share my hard learned lesson.\nNone of my BT devices every connect to any OS/Device other than tablets/cell phones automatically.

This is able to kill off my session completely if the redrawing takes much time, as is the case with many complex statistical plots.\nIs it possible to resize windows in current Unity using a wireframe only?\n\nA: To control how the window manager (compiz) controls resizing requires a bit of poking around in the various gsettings values.\nIn particular there is the resize compiz plugin with a mode parameter which you can fiddle with.\nBy default it is set to \"0\" which is \"Normal\" and equates to whole window resizing\ngsettings set org.compiz.resize:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/resize/ mode 0\n\nA value of \"1\" is enough to stop whole window resizing and switch to displaying a frame\ngsettings set org.compiz.resize:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/resize/ mode 1\n\nA value of \"2\" displays a frame with a blur of the window border\ngsettings set org.compiz.resize:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/resize/ mode 2\n\nA value of \"3\" shrinks the window during resizing:\ngsettings set org.compiz.resize:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/resize/ mode 3\n\n", "Q: Grub problems after upgrading Ubuntu from 12.04 -> 14.04.1 Recently I have upgraded my Ubuntu PC from 12.04 LTS to 14.04.1.

So I wondered if I could contribute to Ubuntu and help to update some packages so not everybody has to manually install them? It may sound a bit naive but somebody has to do that, right?!\nI am willing to learn if it is more complicated!\n\nA: Some packages are updated by community members, but the bulk of the software in the Ubuntu repository are updated by Canonical.\nThey categorize their software broadly into supported and unsupported. Canonical provides updates for the former and community members can provide updates for the latter. See the wikipedia page for more information on the classifications. \nIt appears that Eclipse specifically is unsupported free software, so the packages must be managed by a community member. I was unable to find out who exactly, but it is likely someone on the Eclipse development side. In any event, any packages in the Ubuntu repos have to go through a thorough approval process so it may be more involved than simply uploading a package you download from the source website.\n", "Q: Is there something similar to \"open with\" in nautilus for midnight commander?

The way foreman generates the scripts is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*app\n\n*app-web\n\n*app-web-1\n\n*app-worker\n\n*app-worker-1\n\n\nwhere \"app-web\" and \"app-worker\" are set to start on starting \"app\", and \"app-web-1\" and \"app-worker-1\" are set to start on starting \"app-web\" and \"app-worker\" respectively. As I understand it, this structure is to allow you to easily add further web and worker processes when load increases, while still managing the whole thing from the top-level \"app\" job.\nSo, I want to set various environment variables in my jobs. I can of course put them directly into the bottom-level scripts, but it would be better to put them in the top level so they only have to be defined once. I thought I would be able to do this in app.conf by simply using env and export:\nenv FOO=bar\nexport FOO\n\nbut this doesn't seem to work: it's fine if I put it in the middle \"app-web\" job, but if I put in the top-level \"app\" it doesn't get inherited by the bottom-level \"app-web-1\". So, my second attempt was to put that in the top-level script, and then try and re-export in the middle one with just export FOO, but this doesn't work either.\nIs it possible to do what I want, or should I simply settle for defining the variables in multiple places?\n\nA: You can do this in two way: export variable in the middle script or save it in file and source it in lowest script.\nI tested this example on lubuntu 12.04:\nmyapp.conf is the main script and export MYAPP_FOO variable:\n# myapp - \ndescription \"export environment variable\"\nenv MYAPP_FOO=bar\nexport MYAPP_FOO\n\ntask\nconsole log\nscript\n    exec  echo \"$MYAPP_FOO - myapp\" \nend script\n\napp-web.conf is the middle script that export parent's variable and define and export MYAPP_FOO1\n# app-web - \ndescription \"export environment variable\"\nstart on starting myapp\nenv MYAPP_FOO1=bar1\nexport MYAPP_FOO1\nexport MYAPP_FOO\n\ntask\nconsole log\nscript  \n   exec  echo \"$MYAPP_FOO - app-web - $MYAPP_FOO1\" \nend script\n\nFinally app-web1.conf print variable: \n# app-web1 - \ndescription \"export environment variable\"\nstart on starting app-web\n\ntask\nconsole log\nscript  \n   exec  echo \"$MYAPP_FOO - app-web1 - $MYAPP_FOO1\" \nend script\n\nI used sudo start myapp and the result in /var/log/upstart/app-web1.log is:\nbar - app-web1 - bar1\n\nAnother approach is to define your variable in file and source it where you need:\n# app-web1 - \ndescription \"export environment variable\"\nstart on starting app-web\n\ntask\nconsole log\nscript  \n   . /path/where/you/want/environmentFile\n   exec  echo \"$MYAPP_FOO - app-web1 - $MYAPP_FOO1\" \nend script\n\nOr you can create environmentFile in the middle script:\n# app-web - \ndescription \"export environment variable\"\nstart on starting myapp\nenv MYAPP_FOO1=bar1\n\ntask\nconsole log\nscript \n   env | grep MYAPP_ > /path/where/you/want/environmentFile \n   exec  echo \"$MYAPP_FOO - app-web - $MYAPP_FOO1\" \nend script\n\n", "Q: Sublime Text: see how many resources each plugin is using How can I see how many resources each Sublime Text plugin is using?\n\nA: You can open System Monitor and check a process called plugin_host.

Barring something like that or a filesystem like xfs or maybe btrfs, try the following.\nBear in mind that my experience is with desktop systems and things involving servers may be a bit different.\nIt ain't pretty, but you can always boot a live CD and use a tool like partimage, dump, or even tar or rsync to copy your entire root and home partitions to another partition, preferably on another drive, but you have to do this before you run your updates or anything else breaks.\nNote the use of a live CD (or another Linux running from another partition, etc.) because root and, very often, home get updated all the time on a live system and you want a copy of all the files frozen at the same moment in time so they all agree with each other.\nThis can be optimized a bit if you know of things that don't change or don't matter and exclude them from the backups - things like caches, /tmp (in most cases), and, especially, .thumbnails. (And if you're going file by file - like with rsync or tar, skip /sys and /proc because they aren't \"real\" filesystems anyway. In most cases, you can also skip lost+found on each partition. On /home, most of what matters in this case are config files - usually in hidden directory trees which start with $HOME/.rest of path  (The . makes the directories invisible to most commands and programs unless you tell them to look for files/directories like that.)\nSince most updates won't scramble your system, you don't need a full backup like this before every one of them. Just make sure your backup is recent enough to be functional and that your current data files are either on their own partition - safely out of the way - or much more fully backed up.\nIf you go the full backup route, there are tools like rsync and things built on top of it which use hard links to make subsequent full backups based on an original backup, but which essentially only take up additional space for files that have actually changed content since the original or last backup.\nAs alluded to above, it's almost always a good idea to store /home on its own separate partition. That mostly insulates it from upgrade issues like having to restore / from a backup. Only the configuration files and any file format or new content changes have to be dealt with. (Programs like Firefox and Thunderbird seem to change almost all their files very frequently.)\nI don't see anybody else talking about it, but I partition a new system with two roots and two homes (pairs of live and backup, around 30GB each), swap, and whatever is left goes into a big data partition - which is almost immune to update issues and can be fully backed up and restored at any time on my live system as long as I stop any applications that might be writing to it.\nIf you make backups this way, you can (almost) just switch to the backups (in your boot menu, e.g. grub) and start running again without doing anything else. (You do have to point the fstab entry for /home in your backup root partition to the partition where the backup of /home is.)\nThis also gives you the option of switching to your backup immediately so you can continue getting work done - possibly with the option of keeping the broken versions around to see if you can diagnose or fix them when time permits.\n", "Q: Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 do not work After installing Ubuntu 14.04, my Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu cannot boot anymore, I get the message below, please help me fix it as I cannot use my computer any more.

I am currently running Xubuntu 14.04, but I do not have the impression that the exact Linux version matters much, because the problem was not there under XP, but under both Lubuntu and Xubuntu. As the problem is a bit hard to \"pigeonhole\", a longer description follows here:\nMenu entries appear sort of \"greyed out\" as soon as the mouse hovers over them (i.e. when they are highlighted) (not really greyed out, but shown in a silvery whitish colour) which makes it hard to read them. Against some backgrounds, it is almost impossible to read these highlighted entries.\nIn some applications, notably synaptic, list entries are not shown (or disappear as soon as they have been displayed for a microsecond). You can sometimes make them temporarily visible by using the scroll wheel, but the visibility is very fleeting, and not predictable. You also see that the entries are definitely \"there\", because you can move among them using the cursor keys, and in the lower window, which shows the package descriptions, the descriptions change. \nIn Thunar (but it used to be the same in pcfmman under lubuntu), icons almost only appear over or beside those entries that the mouse is hovering over. Folder icons, when they are there, partly lose their blue color and are shown in white.\nIn Firefox, most of the tiles in the graphical menu disappear after having been shown for a microsecond or so. They also can be made to appear briefly by moving the mouse over them, or by clicking and dragging, but the effect is not very predictable.\nOften a part of the background shines through, notably when you type something on the command line in a terminal window. You then see only a part of the background instead of what you have typed, and you can usually make this disappear if you place the terminal window somewhere else, or when you minimise the window which is shining through.\nNotably, the fleetingly-visible list entries were already present in Xubuntu's graphical installer (e.g. when selecting the language), and (as I already said) in Lubuntu.\nIn evince, pages become suddenly invisible. When you scroll, they reappear. This is quite reliable. \nNo xorg.conf is being used at all.\nThe graphics adaptor is an NVidia GeForce4 MX 4000, the kernel driver used is nouveau. The kernel is passed the kernel option:\ndrm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=VGA-1:edid/1680x1050.bin\nvia GRUB, to make the the desktop fill my monitor correctly (which works fine).\nThis is all the technical information I can think of at the moment. Can anybody give me any suggestions on where to look further?\n\nA: You could try the NVidia's proprietary driver.\nOpen the Ubuntu Software Center, and go to Edit->software sources. There, open \"Additional drivers\" and select the nvidia one. It will take a while to install.\n", "Q: How do I open an URL from a bash script? I have a simple script to start a node.js webserver and open the URL in a browser. However the last part doesn't seem to work, it wont open the URL in a browser (or anywhere else).\nThis is the code I got so far:\n#!/bin/bash\nnode server.js;\nxdg-open http://localhost:9000/;\n\nEverywhere I search I find the same, I have to use:\nxdg-open URL\n\nbut it only seems to work while typing that in the terminal, not in my startserver.sh file. It will start the server but not open the URL, typing the code in a terminal however does seem to work.\nIt's confusing, why doesn't it work inside my script?\n\nA: It's a very short answer, start node server.js as background process:\n#!/bin/bash\nnode server.js &\nxdg-open http://localhost:9000/\n\n\nA: xdg-open is actually a shell script (on my system). It uses heuristics to guess what your browser is. You could see what it is trying to do by running it with from within the script with\nsh -x xdg-open http://localhost:9000/ >&/tmp/errors\n\nLook in /tmp/errors for any failure messages.\nYou may also simply replace xdg-open by the name of your browser, eg firefox.\nIf you are launching a script from a desktop button, it may be that when the launcher gets to the end of the script, it kills the process group. Try adding a\n sleep 99999\n\nat the end to see if this is the case.\nIf you are trying to run your startserver.sh from somewhere other than your desktop environment, xdg-open may have a hard time trying to find which browser to use. You could try setting some environment variables to help it.\n", "Q: No bootable device I know this isn't exactly a Linux problem but I'm getting no help anywhere else. I'm trying to reinstall ubuntu onto my laptop but I keep getting the error \"No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\" but I have it on my USB ready to install but for some ready it won't recognize it at all. I've tried everything I could find on the internet and none of them are useful, please help!\n\nA: Assuming your computer supports boot from USB, you may have to enable it to do so in your BIOS settings. Access the BIOS settings by pressing the appropriate key at startup (varies from machine to machine, typically one of the function keys. google your machine to find out what it is), then go to the boot options and ensure boot from USB is enabled.\nIf this fails, it's possible the USB you created is no good and you should try putting a fresh image on it. unetbootin is popular and has a reputation for not causing as many errors as other similar utilities.\n\nA: Sounds like you're using a UEFI system. When you create usb installers they are typically for mbr bios only, it depends what program you use to make it. Install using a DVD and it should work fine.\n\nA: I had the same problem installing ubuntu! Here is what to do. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to BIOS \n\n*On security, make USB on the top.\n\n*Make sure that the USB has a good copy of ubuntu\n\n*Click 'try ubuntu'\n\n*install efibootmgr\n\n*Change so boot order so ubuntu is at the top\n\n*Unplug USB\n\n*Reboot\nIt worked with my computer.

The reason for that is that I can then create a ghost based on the first partition only and therefore save a lot of space. Alternatively, I would like some help on how to create a ghost that doesn't consider specific folders under my home directory (i.e. my personal files). Any ideas?\n\nA: Short answer is you can't. because Linux uses filesystem hierarchy. And there isn't only one path for storing application's data.\nHowever, most space for data is on /usr directory but for your case, it doen'st help you for seperating it because some config files will leave out and you'll end up with package confliction.\n", "Q: How to get exit status of anacron jobs to catch errors?

I took a look at the permissions on each file and folder on my Home and it says:\n\nThe permissions of \"Everything\" could not be determined\n\nI no longer can access the directories and files in home.\n\nFollowing the answer from Permission denied on ~ even though owner listed as me I ran the following command:\nfind ~ -type d -exec chmod 750 \\;\n\nand got this output:\nfind: pred.c:1932: launch: Assertion `starting_desc >= 0' failed.\n\n\nIs there any way to get back my default configurations?  \nEDIT\nI then tried this:\nsudo chown root:root ~/\n\ngot no output\nand then \nsudo chmod -R  777 ~/\n\nThat pretty much solved my problem but for two files which returned\nchmod: cannot access `/home/leo/.gvfs': Permission denied\nchmod: cannot access `/home/leo/.config/google-chrome/.com.google.Chrome.Z07tM9': No    such file or directory.\n\nTHAT WAS JUST A BAD IDEA.\n\nA: You first attempt to fix it was just missing '{}' but then you made things a lot worse...\nThere is hardly ever a reason for any file to have 777 permissions, and there is hardly even a good use case for the -R flag when using chmod, because we need directories to be executable in order to enter or stat them, but we rarely want all files to be executable.\nFirst, chown your home directory. Logged in as yourself, run\nsudo chown -R $USER: ~\n\nIf you have simply run something like\nchmod 600 ~\n\nThen revert it:\nchmod 755 ~\n\nHowever, if you have run something really ill-advised like (do not execute) chmod -R 777 ~, then fixing the permissions will be more tricky.\nfind is very helpful for this. Directory permissions in your home will vary, and could be 700, 775, 755 or 750. To err on the side of caution, I would do this:\nfind ~ -type d -exec chmod 700 '{}' +\n\nSo only you can access the directories. You could instead use 755 and then correct these modes:\nchmod 700 ~/.local ~/.cache ~/.dbus ~/.thumbnails ~/.gconf ~/.thunderbird\n\nThen files. You might have had some executable scripts in your home but in general files should not be executable. Most files in your home would probably have had 664 or 644 permission, but again to be safe you might want to go with\nfind ~ -type f -exec chmod 600 '{}' +\n\nThis makes it so only you can access the files and directories in your home. If you prefer, Use 644 instead, and then correct the mode of the Xauthority file and a few others:\nchmod 600 ~/.Xauthority ~/.ICEauthority ~/.bash_history ~/.local/share/keyrings/* ~/.xsession-errors ~/.lesshst\n\nIf you want to be really thorough, you can install a fresh Ubuntu VM or check the permissions of ~ on another machine... something like\nfind ~ -type d -not -perm 700 -exec stat -c \"%n %a\" {} \\; | tee dirperms\n\nand\nfind ~ -type f -not -perm 600 -exec stat -c \"%n %a\" {} \\; | tee fileperms\n\nWill generate lists you can use to make corrections.\n", "Q: HP Pavilion tx2514 wacom convertible tablet \"Wacom ISDv4 93 Pen stylus\" won't reveal launcher I have installed the latest drivers.\nI also tried increasing launcher sensitivity using \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\" and to adjust pressure sensitivity.\nI would like to use my laptop in tablet mode, but can't without turning off auto hide launcher.\nI would like some real space when working in tablet mode.\n\nA: I have found a workaround for my problem.\nIf you use \"Onboard\", you can reveal the Launcher with the Super key.\nYou can still auto-hide Onboard, and if you set it to show notification icon, and set it to auto-show when editing text the keyboard will reveal.

Personally I would suggest leaving your system as is. \nCurrently your bootloaders are nice and neatly stored on seperate drives allowing you to easily replace you operating systems at any time because they aren't aware of each other, and you CAN choose which OS to boot by pressing the appropriate F key to access you system's quick boot menu.

Note that command in this file are run as root, so you can simply add echo -n 0 > /sys/module/video/parameters/brightness_switch_enabled and skip the sudo:\nsudo sed -i 's/^exit 0/# &/' /etc/rc.local\nsudo tee -a /etc/rc.local <<EOF\necho -n 0 > /sys/module/video/parameters/brightness_switch_enabled\nexit 0\nEOF\n\nIf you know how to edit the file, you can edit it and add echo -n 0 > /sys/module/video/parameters/brightness_switch_enabled to the file before the exit 0 line, instead of running the above commands.\nNote that the script is run with the shebang line #! /bin/sh -e, so if any commands in it fail, the entire script fails.

The nvidia driver will then not work in a dual monitor setup since it defaults to the nvidia (performance) card. I don't get the design decision behind that (cost maybe?).\nI found that the solution in my case was to either switch the default mode to power saving within the nvidia driver settings, or to switch to the nouveau driver (which seems to default to the power saving mode anyway). I could then use the second monitor when connected via the HDMI port.\nTry switching to strictly using power saving mode and see if the dual monitor setup works though the system settings. If it does, then you know that you've got this quirky hardware issue. How the manufacturers solve this themselves in other OSes, and why is it not fixed in the Linux based drivers is beyond the scope of my knowledge.\nBut not all hope is lost. There maybe some other (better?) answers here [ Does Ubuntu 16.04 support hybrid graphics cards (bumblebee) ]. The current release (3.2.1) of bumblebee is rather old (2013) and I can't personally recommend installing it simply because I have not, but it seems that there are quite a few users that don't have issues with it. There is promise, however, of it's revival (checkout the develop branch on the Bumblebee Project githubs).\nWhether you choose to take the bumblebee route or not, you should checkout the multi-monitor info on their wiki [ https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Multi-monitor-setup ], it's quite informative.\n\nA: I have this laptop and i use it with an external 4k screen connected via the thunderbolt(display port) socket. It works fine with both screens at 4k 60hz and i don't have an xorg.conf. I have noticed that the using HDMI port can slow things down a bit display port is much better.\nI am using 16.04 which works great but i have not run 14.04 on this laptop but i used both the 15. releases stably as well.\nI think the issue is that graphics driver is not the right one.\nI am using nvidia-364 from https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa and using the updates from there.\nIncidentally this laptop and the owc thunderbolt dock work really well.\n\nA: From https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/807239/nvidia-server-setting-utility-doesn-t-see-laptop-screen/ :\nJust be sure not to have any /etc/X11/xorg.conf*\nfiles.\nRun this:\nsudo rm -v /etc/X11/xorg.conf*\n\nThen rebooted again and I could log in having nvidia driver perfectly working.\n\nA: On every linux distribution I have used every time I have used, whenever I plug a HDMI cable to another monitor, I get a resolution change and the things you're reporting because the settings are configuring the resolution for your external monitor. However, this also affects your laptop because in order to set setting for the other monitor, it must also set them on your laptop first, so that the HDMI cable can broadcast what your laptop screen is showing to the other monitor. So in my opinion, there isn't a way to \"fix\" this. \nFor example, I might connect a monitor with a resolution of 1366x768 but I might have a laptop with a resolution of 1024x768. The settings will tweak the resolution setting and might make the laptop have the edges of the scree not show the Ubuntu menu bar. However, they have been tweaked so that the external monitor can see it properly.\n\nA: the reason you dont see the internal display in nvidia-settings\nhttps://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/807239/nvidia-server-setting-utility-doesn-t-see-laptop-screen/\nyou can set the settings for your internal display via ubuntu's System Settings --> Displays after doing the following (i had to do this as it got the resolution and something else wrong that messed up the layout on the internal display):\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins\nHow to get multiple displays working with docking station?\nIn CCSM go to \"General Options\" --> \"Display Settings\" and do the following:\nUn-check \"Detect Outputs\"\nIn the Outputs array, set the resolutions of each of your screens.\ni had 1920x1080+0+0 as the only entry in which i additionally added 1920x1080+1920+0\nscreenshot of compiz settings manager display settings\nafter that i went to ubuntu's System Settings --> Displays and had set internal display's settings there.\n\nA: Your problem may be with the NVidia drivers.\nTry using the open source Nouveau drivers.\nGo to the Additional Drivers page and select the \"Open Source - Nouveau\" option.\n\nA: Check if the right driver is in use:\n$ lspci -nnk | grep \"VGA\\|'Kern'\\|3D\\|Display\" -A2 \nIf it isn't blacklist the wrong driver:\n$ sudo echo nouveau >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nreboot and look again which driver is in use.\nIf the right driver is in use and you have still the problem, then you need to configure the xorg.conf file.Here is a good wiki, how to configure the xorg.conf for two displays\n\nA: You could try set screen0=\"buildtin\", and screen1=\"monitor1\", and that is in xorg.conf, and you could use gedit from the terminal, and that is in this two sections here:\n      section monitor\n      section screen\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n\nA: Just go with the official NVidia drivers directly from NVidia!\nfor your card, NVidia is offering 352.63 \nhttp://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/95285/en-uk\nand use this guide to install it:\nhttp://www.allaboutlinux.eu/remove-nouveau-and-install-nvidia-driver-in-ubuntu-15-04/\nRegards\n\nA: Unfortunately this is the way TwinView Dual-Display Architecture works...

Ubuntu can also read the FAT filesystem but no payment history to Microsoft exists.  What is the difference?\n\nA: This is more of an issue with exFAT, not FAT.\n\n\n*\n\n*exFAT is the Microsoft-owned proprietary filesystem that Android (and any other device) need to license from Microsoft in order to support.\n\n*FAT (eg FAT32 + VFAT) is free to implement and implemented pretty much universally, including in Ubuntu.\nOne of the notable benefits of exFAT over FAT is its support for individual files larger than 4GB, an essential feature for video recording applications.\nThe most notable drawback, obviously, is its proprietary nature, giving a Microsoft tax to every device that implements the standard.  It is an essential part of the SDXC standard, meaning that devices that support SD cards over 32GB have to pay money to Microsoft.\n\nEdit: after reading the actual article, I realise now that the article itself suggests that vendors are paying to use even FAT (not exFAT).  Sorry for assuming that was your own confusion.\nHowever, the point muru made in his answer still stands: the free software implementations of FAT (including the implementation in Linux, the kernel used in Android) are not subject to Microsoft patents because they don't implement the patented algorithm for maintaining long filenames and 8/3 letter filenames side by side.\nThe article even admits it can only speculate, and I think it's probably wrong, for the above reasons.  Or, at least, perhaps it does not have the full story: it's possible that these vendors are licensing other technology from Microsoft and the contract they have with Microsoft just happens to also bundle in some FAT technology even though they don't need a license for this.\n\nA: More specifically, the exFAT filesystem. That's because exFAT is part of the SDXC standard, and device vendors have to support it if they are going to allow external memory. The FAT patent that the article talks of only ever came into play against TomTom, IIRC. Linux in general is able to avoid the FAT patent on a technicality, according to this linux.com article.\n", "Q: Can't boot from USB; no selection option in grub; usb 1st boot choice First, I have looked through the suggested questions that may have an answer, but nothing seems on point.\nI have a dual boot Ubuntu 14.04/Windows 7 system. I have decided to play around with some other distros and loaded one onto a USB stick with unetbootin. It won't boot. When the GRUB selection menu comes up, there is no \"new\" option to boot from the USB, unlike the previous GRUB when I was running 12.04.\nThe USB is selected as first priority boot, the cd drive second, and the hard drive 3d in bios.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Being able to boot to a USB from the GRUB menu strikes me as unusual. This would only happen if you ran sudo update-grub while the USB was mounted. In my experience most users only add operating systems to GRUB that are on internal hard drives, although I'm not sure if there are any actual advantages or disadvantages in doing so. Normally I just boot a USB from the BIOS manual boot menu.\nIf that's what you really want, though, booting up Ubuntu and running sudo update-grub with your Live USB plugged in should add it to your GRUB menu if the USB contains a valid OS.\nIf you have USB first in your BIOS boot order it should definitely be working. I think eiter your Live USB is corrupt, or your BIOS doesn't like unetbootin. I have had problems with unetbootin in the past with certain distros. Make the Live USB using Ubuntu's built-in \"Startup Disk Creator\", by following this answer, or using the dd command as described in this answer (NOTE: Be very careful when using dd) might solve the problem.\n\nA: Burn Plop Boot Manager to CD.\nBoot your computer to the CD, and Plop Boot Manager will give you an option to boot up your USB.\nHere is the link for Plop Boot Manager:  http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanagers.html\n\nA: When booting with GRUB, hit Esc key which will take you to the GRUB terminal, then type exit.

I have used an identical means this time as well. Namely manually editing the /etc/network/interfaces file to set the static IP.\nMy router has the IP reserved for this machine. The machine acquires the desired static IP (I now get the networking issues message and extra 60 second wait at reboot). I can ping the router and 8.8.8.8 but I cannot look anything up. I cannot use curl with a domain name like google.com.\nMy windows laptop does not see it but I can access it by going to the designated static IP.\nI tried using nslookup as suggested in the referenced question but the timed out without reaching any servers.\n\nA: I don't typically want to answer my own questions but I fixed this issue - mostly. The answers were on these 2 posts:\nStatic IP configuration causing apt-get errors\nresolv.conf doesn't get set on reboot when networking is configured for static ip\nUltimately the answer was to add:\ndns-nameservers 10.0.1.1\n\nAt the end of the eth0 definition in /etc/network/interfaces. This solves all of my access issues to he outside world. However, I have gone from a very quick boot up to a boot up that takes a couple of minutes while it waits on the network config for some reason. The static IP is reserved with the router so conflicts really shouldn't be the issue.\nAnyways the system now works functionally with the static IP I want. The long boot up is just an annoyance.\n\nA: If your installation was first setup via DHCP this other post might give you additional insights:\nStatic ip but dynamic nameservers?\n", "Q: Drive unmounts when I try to scan it for viruses I have an old hard drive from a friend that I'm trying to get data off of to transfer to a new computer. First, thought, I wanted to scan it for viruses. So I connected it to my Lubuntu computer with an IDE (I think--it's from the Windows 2000 era) to USB connector and it successfully mounted. I can browse the file system. But every time I try to scan it for viruses it unmounts and remounts. I've tried both ClamAV and Comodo and it does the same thing. Anyone know what's going on?\n\nUpdate: It does the same thing if I try to copy a lot of files too. But I can can get a small word document off of it no problem...\n\nA: Is your Lubuntu computer a laptop? Is your friends IDE a 3.5 inch HDD? If so, I think the problem here may be that your USB connectors cannot provide enough power to spin the drive for extended times. I had this problem when I was trying to spin a 2.5 inch on a Raspberry Pi (not good...not...good). Here are some solutions that may help if this is the problem (which is what it looks like): \n\n\n*\n\n*Try on a Desktop Machine - Desktop machines provide much more amperage through their usb ports. They are almost always capable of spinning 3.5 HDDs.\n\n*Save as much power as you can - Darken your screen, unplug other devices, turn off wifi and blutooth, and pray to God that you have enough power to spin the drive on your laptop. You may also look at powertop. This measures power usage from multiple devices and can disable/change certain devices' power consumption.\n\n*Try on another laptop - It may be your machines is just too efficient when it comes to power production. Another laptop may have better luck.\n\n\nThis is about all you can do. I would bet 95% that the problem you are experiencing IS power related. Your system can spin the disk for a bit, but after too much speed, the system cuts off connection to the USB to preserve the core system components. After the amperage builds up again, it allows connection again. This is why you would experience disconnecting/reconnecting happening, especially with large file or large system scans.\n\nA: If it's a problem with something the antivirus is doing rather than a power issue, I would suggest a rather run-around solution. Use something like VirtualBox to manage the files in a virtual machine. Copy them to the virtual hard-drive to avoid infecting your actual system, and run antivirus on the now virtually local files, to avoid over-spinning or over powering the HDD. After the integrity is verified, you can wipe the external drive and copy the clean files to the wiped drive. Long process, but it should work no problem.\n", "Q: Where is the skeleton thunar.xml?

One has Windows 8.1 Pro, one has Windows 7 pro and the 3rd (now) has Ubuntu 14. I am new to Linux so I'm going to be learning this operating system as I go but before I get started, I want to try and make things a little more comfortable for me as I acclimate myself to the different technology.\nInitially, I installed Ubuntu (4 days ago) and got a \"grub recovery\" problem that I didn't understand and could find a resolution for so I removed Ubuntu from the 3rd hard drive, repaired my windows' installations by performing a few bootrec procedures and am now back to my Windows Multiboot preferred state. I also disconnected (physically since doing it in the BIOS didn't work) my 2 windows hard drives and performed a clean install of Ubuntu on the 3rd hard drive...\nI now have all 3 drives plugged in and my Dualboot for Windows is working fine, but I do not get the choice to boot to Linux, I only get the Window's options in the multiboot and I would like to know how (if I can) to set up the multi-boot so Linux becomes one of the options. If it is not possible, I can always turn off the other 2 drives in the BIOS and simply work it that way, but I would prefer not to...\nAlso, I would like to know if it is possible to make a few changes to Ubuntu so it has a more replicated feel of Windows (again, while I acclimate myself to the new system). Things like, creating a task bar with a 'start menu' kinda of thing so I can more easily navigate to my programs... ... the reason for this request is because I installed \"PlayOnLinux\" (a WINE based program) that is supposed to allow me to run a couple Windows games that I like to play but I can't figure out how to find it, open it or run it and I assume that's because I don't know how to use the Ubuntu system...\nSo - long story short (and yes, I do apologize for the lengthy message, but the thingy at the top says the more info the better... lol), anyway... What I'm trying to do is \"add\" Ubuntu to my Windows 8 multiboot options AND create a friendlier 'visual' concept to the actual platform...\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to read this message. \n\nA: Easiest way, set the Ubuntu Hard Drive as your first/primary drive.

In older versions of gnome-terminal the stream was pretty much directly written into a file under /tmp, in newer versions there's buffering, compression and encryption before it's written out. (I can't remember off the top of my head whether the file under /tmp is opened when the first chunk of data is written into the stream, or when the stream first tries to actually write to /tmp; it's a minor implementation detail.)\nThe size of the ring is always a power of two (each slot containing 1 line of the terminal; except for 1 slot is not used due to technical reasons), and is doubled every time it's required due to the growth of the terminal height (but never shrinks back). E.g., with the default height of 24 lines the ring contains the last 31 lines of output, the rest goes to the stream (eventually to /tmp). If you increase the window's height to let's say 40 lines, the in-memory ring will grow to accommodate at most 63 entries at a time.\nWhat you experience is that gnome-terminal tries to open a file in /tmp to store the stream, and exits because of the unexpected failure here. Try with a taller window than the default; it'll crash after pressing Enter 63 (or maybe 127) times.\nThat being said, /tmp should be fixed to be writable (with permissions 1777).\n\nA: I rebooted in recovery mode and followed the instructions the system gave me.  I ran fsck on /dev/sda2, and that fixed the problem.\n\nA: The Read-only file system error is the major clue here.  I would guess that your home directory, where bash tries to store your command history and so forth, is inside a read-only partition.\nI would guess that it tries to update your recent command history on disk once every 32 commands, which is why it's failing on the 32nd command you type in a session.\nNow, a partition may be mounted as read-only if you do it deliberately, but it may also be mounted as read-only if there was an error - this latter behaviour is usually the default for the root partition.\nI'd be surprised if you weren't experiencing other problems if your root partition is mounted read-only.\nYou can try rebooting and checking the disk from the recovery menu.  Press and hold shift as the computer boots, right after the BIOS screen disappears and right before the Ubuntu logo appears.\n\nA: My problem was that a process was running with 100% CPU and probably took all disk resources (Some backup process: Ur-Backup).\nOnce i killed it, all went well. So I would think that a bottle-neck on the IO could cause this error even if there is enough space and you have write permission.\n(Raspberry Pi with Jessy 18/03/16)\n\nA: Ubuntu 18 \nStrangely enough, I had a read-only /tmp filesystem.\nI hardened my /tmp directory and bash-completion worked as it should. Make sure you do not have any processes using the /tmp folder or moving the /tmp folder might be denied to you.\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/var/TMP bs=2048 count=1048576\nmke2fs -j /var/TMP\nmv /tmp /tmp_backup\nmkdir /tmp\nmount -o loop,noexec,nosuid,rw /var/TMP /tmp\nchmod 1777 /tmp\ncp -R /tmp_backup/* /tmp/\nrm -rf /tmp_backup\n\n", "Q: Logins Getting Stuck on Wallpaper After Ubuntu 14.04 Base and Security Update (but not when logging in as Guest) As the title says, after an update sometime last week, logging into my user account only gets as far as changing the background from the login screen's standard to my personal wallpaper.\nNo dashboard or anything else appears: I can only move my mouse pointer around and fruitlessly make selection boxes and right-clicks.\nThere are many questions with similar problems and I have tried all of the following already (in order):\nI went into a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+F1 and ran apt-get update and apt-get upgrade to upgrade 8 packages I had which were still marked as uninstalled. They seem to have installed successfully but the problem persisted after a reboot.\nI then tried installing compiz-settings manager as per the instructions at Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears and using it to re-enable the Unity Plugin. Still no noticable change after a reboot.\nI have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling lightdm, ubuntu-desktop and unity via the terminal, also with no noticable changes after a reboot.\nI renamed my .Xauthority file so that a new one would be created as per the instructions at Ubuntu gets stuck in a login loop. That also did not solve the problem. The Xauthotity file is owned by me. It doesn't look like there is anything wrong in my .profile file either.\nLastly, I found a suggestion on one of these many similar threads that I should disable the desktop icons. I ran some command in the terminal to the effect of \"gnome show-icons false\" and after that for some reason the wallpaper doesn't even appear now and when I tried to reverse the change by running the command again with the value \"true\" instead of false I got an error message to the effect of \"unable to change\" due to permissions or settings or something.\nImportant points: I am able to login as a guest with absolutely no problems at all, which suggests to me that this is not the result of a graphics driver problem.\nI freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit amd) around the end of May: this was not an upgrade from an old version. I have had no problems until now.\nI would greatly appreciate any assistance which you could provide.\nUpdate: 08-30-2014\nAfter a week, I logged back into a terminal and performed some more apt-get updates and upgrades, still to no avail, but I was able to make a new user account within the terminal and log in using the new account with little more than a slight delay!\nI have already checked/removed my old .Xauthority and .profile files to make sure that they are not the problem, and I do not know what other user-specific information may be causing this.\nIf no one can help me find the source of this problem, I would also appreciate any suggestions as to an easy way to migrate my data over to my new, working account from my old one. For example, my applications, my software, my virtual machine, etc.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: nautilus --force-desktop &\n\nFound something that says by running the above line will get you wallkpaper back.

Just add\nset autoread\n\nto your ~/.vimrc. (Also check out the Tail Bundle plugin.)\nThe autoread setting applies only certain events (which can be determined by checking the help text for timestamp (:h timestamp)). To make vim load files more frequently, there are two decent options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Define a function which watches for changes. \n\n*Set an autocommand such as:\nau FocusGained,BufEnter,BufWinEnter,CursorHold,CursorMoved * :checktime\n\nThis will reload whenever vim gains focus, you enter the buffer, move a cursor, idle the cursor. It won't change the current cursor position though.\nemacs can also do this, if you add to your .emacs:\n(global-auto-revert-mode t)\n\nThis doesn't watch for changes either, but the following should:\n(global-auto-revert-tail-mode t)\n\nThis is supposed to work like tail -f, according to the EmacsWiki.\nEven if gedit doesn't support this, I'm sure there are plenty of other GUI editors which do.\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can vim monitor realtime changes to a file\n\n*How to have Emacs auto-refresh all buffers when files have changed on disk?\n\nA: Emacs can do that for you.

See linked question re: TimeMachine in High Sierra\nThis is actually really straightforward. My solution below works for a single user, but can likely be easily adapted for multiple users.\nOn the Ubuntu machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the directory to be shared is mounted and owned by your user (e.g., your backup hard drive is mounted at /mnt/backups in /etc/fstab, and you've created a subdirectory called myMac in this backup folder). Because this is a network share it actually doesn't matter what format the disk uses - it could be ext4, btrfs, etc.\n\n*Install netatalk (open source AFP):\nsudo apt-get install netatalk\n\n\n*Configure the Apple share by editing location at the bottom of the /etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.default file (comment out the line with the home directory and add the actual mount location; add your username):\n#~/                \"Home Directory\"\n/mnt/backups/myMac \"TimeMachine\"    allow:username options:tm,usedots,upriv\n\n(I'm not sure that options:usedots,upriv needs to be explicitly set but it works for me.)\n\n*Restart the netatalk service:\nsudo service netatalk restart\n\n\n*Make sure ports 548/tcp and 5353/udp are open in your firewall.\nOn the Mac machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal and enter:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\n\n*Reboot the computer.\n\n*Mount the network share location by selecting the network share from the leftmost pane in a Finder window, or by selecting \"Connect to server\" from the Finder app's \"Go\" menu (or press ⌘+K) and enter the machine name or IP address of your Ubuntu machine:\nafp://123.456.789.123\n\nUse your Ubuntu user credentials to authenticate when prompted.\n\n*Go to Time Machine preferences (accessible from \"System preferences\") and select \"Change location\", selecting to encrypt backups, and begin the backup setup process.\n\n\n*\n\n*This will automatically create the sparsebundle file necessary for backups.\n\n\n*After setup is complete, wait ~90 seconds for backup to automatically begin, and even longer for it to complete ☺\n", "Q: Ubuntu is my Default OS, how do I install Windows 7 My default OS is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

So please check what you have added new in the system. I have faced issues with wifi getting continuously because of WIFI frequency conflict with other wifi router's. Which is resolved by setting \"Select Auto channel\" mode in router.\nAlso go to software & updates, and check the settings, that will also cause the wifi driver's issues.\nRegards,\nSantosh\n", "Q: why is my ubuntu 14.04 32 bit fresh install painfully slow on my fitpc2 I have 14.04 64 on another machine running well on another machine.\nI installed 14.04 32 bit on this Fitpc2 mini pc with an intel 40 gig ssd drive because it has 1 gig of ram.\nI erased the SSD drive with HDDerase prior to the fresh install, it had been running windows XP formerly. \nI installed ubuntu from a usb drive. I was never prompted to reformat the drive in any way after secure erasing it, nor upon installing the ubunu OS.

I suggest you create and mount a swap partition for that. You can easily set up an encrypted swap partition with dm-crypt, which will break resuming from suspend-to-disk because of the random one-time volume keys.\nTo delete \"OS1\" simply delete that partition with palimpsest, gparted, fdisk or whatever disk partitioning tool you prefer. Do the same for the existing swap partitions to create the larger new one. You can also swapon multiple partitions (works with fstab too).\nOther possible causes\nThis could also be broken hardware or a bad driver. Since the issue correlates with web browsing I suspect a RAM module gone bad or a faulty graphics adapter driver, but you should sort out the swap issue first since that seems more problematic.\n", "Q: Problem with Script not working properly when ran from Custom Launcher I am using 13.10 and I have created a Launcher that I want to place on my Desktop using help from other posts that I found here.

This is to be done with a view to keeping the root filesystem free from tampering and corruption, and make updating and other maintenance a case of swapping in a pre-configured SD card. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI'm happy with regular partitioning and mounting to take care of /home, /var and the like, but it becomes a lot more tricky when dealing with /etc.\nI know some parts of /etc must be writable, such as mtab, and am also aware that /etc is accessed during boot. I have the feeling that it's also advisable to have some parts of /etc persist between boots.\nI'm leaning towards using overlayfs, only on /etc, with the upperdir only containing those files which I want to persist. Anything that only needs to be read from /etc will come through from the lowerdir. The upperdir will be writable with new files, though these will only persist through boots, if identified in a whitelist. A script should run on shutdown to copy these files from the upperdir to the whitelist, and the opposite directly after boot (or during if necessary).\nEDIT\nThe whitelist aims to stop any new files written to the upperdir and persisting between boots.

After upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 from 12.04 I have duplicate entries in dash.\n\nHow can I get rid of them?\n\nA: In Dash, applications are represented by .desktop files. These files are located in either /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications. For snap programs, also look at /var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications\nWhat you see in Dash is not the filename of these .desktop files, but the (application-) name that is defined in the Name= line, inside the file. \nWhen you have duplicate appearances of the same application in Dash, it almost certainly means that you have desktop files in either /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share applications (or even the snap folder) with a different file name, but representing the same application, and with the same Name= line.\nThis is for example the result when I copy the gedit.desktop file, rename it to monkey.desktop and copy it into /usr/share/applications:\n\nIn your case it is probably the result of installed new versions of applications you already had installed, these new versions install new .desktop files, but with a slightly different (file-)name.\nWhat you should do is look inside both directories, find these \"almost duplicate\" .desktop files, remove the oldest and keep the latest. \nSome more information\nFrom the two locations: /usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications, the latter takes precedence. If two .desktop files with the same filename exist in both directories, the local one shows up in Dash (if just copied, it takes a logout / login). That is why it is normally good practice to first copy a .desktop file to the local directory (to add items to the launcher's quicklist for example) before editing, and leave the global one untouched.\nIf you install a newer version of some software, and the newly installed .desktop file name differs from the old one (and the old one is not removed for some reason), the application will have multiple occurrences in Dash. The same happens when the .desktop file is replaced, but people forget they have a local (edited) version of the .desktop file.\n", "Q: problem with konika-minolta magicolor 4750en I am teacher in 12k.

I am still using my Magicolor 4750DN and recently changed from Slackware to Ubuntu.  I had the same problem as described above, where the printer just spins but never prints anything.  In Ubuntu 18.04, I was using the latest (2011!) drivers (available on the KonicaMinolta website) and a standard IPP port in CUPS.\nTo fix the problem, I found I had to use the old PPD driver off the printer's installation CD (konica-minolta-magicolor-4750.ppd) and use the AppSocket/HP JetDirect with the URI socket://[printer_ip_address] and port 9100.

The proxy remains unchanged.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: When you call the script, a new child shell is invoked to run it. Its proxies are set, but the proxy of the parent process (your shell) can't be changed from a child process. Try sourcing the script, i.e. call it like\n. setproxy 21\n\nThen the script will be interpreted by your current shell.\n", "Q: Load a Kernel module multiple times in 14.04 LTS? the original modprobe command had a switch -o to rename a module when loading it into the kernel.

The bonding module supports multiple bonds, but defaults to one. Edit or create /etc/modprobe.d/bonding.conf and add:\noptions bonding max_bonds=2\nfor 2 bonds (or adjust accordingly).

In an enterprise environment, I would put more effort into making it work with the UUID instead of the \"/dev/\" address, but you should be safe using /dev/sdaX in /etc/fstab instead of UUID reference, at least to be able to boot your system while you continue to search for the answer to why exactly the boot is failing in spite of having the correct UUID in /etc/fstab.\nIf you wish to go this route, use the following procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery shell or boot into a live USB drive or CD\n\n*Mount your system partition that is failing to boot\n\n*Edit the /etc/fstab file in the system partition mentioned in Step 2 as root and replace UUID=XXXXX with the corresponding /dev/sdX label in all of the relevant /etc/fstab entries.\nNote: This procedure is known to me to be reliable for Ubuntu and Ubuntu-derived distributions (as of the writing of this article; this could easily change with any upcoming release). I know for a fact that it won't work reliably for some other distributions such as knoppix or Arch Linux (this is due to differences in the way that UDEV scans in devices and gives them names in the /dev filesystem).

Every time I try to connect, it says Connecting for a while, and then it fails with the error message:\n\nIP configuration was unavailable\n\nOr, if I play with the wireless setup (changing the driver, using direct commandline methods to connect to the network), then the error message changes:\n\nAuthorization supplicant timed out\n\nwhich is weird, because there's no need to authenticate anything (it's an open network).\nIt's interesting, because I know that my current setup can connect to a wireless network, as it works perfectly fine at home (which, unlike the school network, is locked down), and it uses DHCP there as well.\nI've tried running sudo dhclient wlan0, but nothing happens.\nMy wireless card is a Broadcom BCM4313, and I'm using the wl driver.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: For your device in 14.04 brcmsmac is the best driver in most cases and it is best if power management is off.\nPlease do:\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nThen reboot and make sure only the brcmsmac and bcma driver is loaded they are both currently blacklisted so you may have to unblacklist them by doing:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nThen remove brcmsmac and bcma save the file then close gedit and reboot.\nYou may have to install gksudo.\ngksudo gedit /etc/pm/power.d/wireless\n\n(this will create or edit a configuration file that will override the default power management behavior) and enter the following: \n#!/bin/sh\n\n/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off \n\nabove exit0, then save gedit, close and reboot.\nChange the channel to 6 if you can 4 people on that network are using 1 and 11 so that can cause issues.\nAfter you make these changes if you still can not connect then post a new file from the script.\n", "Q: How to copy a certain file several times with a regular ending? I have a single file (a PDF) and I want to have lots of identical copies in the same folder (200 would be nice) named file-001, file-002 etc.\nHow do I do it?\n\nA: To make a single duplicate of a file you probably know that you can use cp:\ncp file file-001\n\nNow, to make more duplicates to a file, you can combine cp with xargs. In your case:\necho file-{001..200} | xargs -n 1 cp file\nwill copy file to file-001, file-002,... ,file-200. See man xargs for more info.\n\nA: As always, the python truck comes late, but:\nmake it executable, drag it over a terminal window, drag the file to copy over the terminal window and set the number of copies:\nscript file number_ofcopies\n\nThe number of leading zeros is set automatically, the files are named file_001.pdf, file_002.pdf, with the filenumbers placed before the extension.\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport sys\nimport shutil\n\norig = sys.argv[1]; n = sys.argv[2]; size = len(str(n)); out = (orig[:orig.rfind(\".\")], orig[orig.rfind(\".\"):])\nfor item in [out[0]+\"_\"+(size-len(str(item)))*\"0\"+str(item)+out[1] for item in range(1, int(n)+1)]:\n    shutil.copyfile(orig, item)\n\n\nA: This is the classic case where shell tricks help a lot.\nfor i in {000..199}; do cp file file-$i; done\n\nAnd I know it's a joke, but if you want a random  _ or - separating the number from the name you can use: \nfor i in {000..199}; do \n    cp file file$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '_-' | fold -w 1 | head -n 1 )$i; \ndone\n\n(multiple line to help readability...)\n:-P\n\nA: You could do something like\n< file tee file-{001..200}\n\nhowever if the medium becomes unreadable it will not matter how many copies are on it - fundamentally backups require diversity.\nNote that tee writes its standard input to standard output as well as to each of the given files - for large files, or for files containing binary data or other special characters that may interfere with your terminal settings, you will probably want to dump standard output to the bit bucket\n< file > /dev/null tee file-{001..200}\n\n", "Q: Not able to hide hidden files / folders from nautilus broswer This is the issue in Ubuntu 14.04\nI am not able to hide hidden files/folders permanently from nautilus browser. i am able to hide hidden files/folders from nautilus browser temporarily but when i am restarting the machine it automatically showing the hidden files/folders in the nautilus browser.\n\nA: Go to the preferences (edit -> preferences) then click the\n[✔] Show hidden and backup files\n\noption, so it is unchecked.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 does not give resolution option that Vista gives I have a dual boot machine with Windows Vista Home and Ubuntu 14.04 just recently installed.

Did you ever got it working under linux?\nI've had this exact same laptop for a while now and searching over the years I've learned that HDMI support for this hardware is almost nonexistent under linux due to it being indirectly wired through the Nvidia  card (Optimus Hybrid Graphics). The most promising workaround I've found involves firing two simultaneous sessions (one with each video card). The problem is this two sessions do not share applications in real time and you don't get any sound from the HDMI output.\nYou can check all about it here: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/08/get-hdmi-working-with-nvidia-optimus-on.html\nAlso here, if you use bumblebee (you totally should): https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Multi-monitor-setup\nThe second best option is using the mini display port output which is connected directly to the integrated graphics card.

I think I have an idea how to do that for multiple users, but haven't tried it yet. The big one is, with only a 128GB SSD I don't want to load up too many applications on it. Once I start getting a slew of games from Steam, I'm bound to fill up and slow down the SSD. I'd like a good way to move the directory those applications will install in over to the 2TB HDD (sdb1). SSDs run slow if you fill them up, so please don't tell me to just let it go. This is a real issue for more and more of us now that you can get a SSD like mine for around $60.\nWhat I suspect I can do, but am not so sure, is to use the same technique for moving the Home folder to move the usr directory, or maybe better yet just usr\\games (if that's where Steam will put the games I get) over to the HDD. Could someone give an example of doing that? I'd move it right after a fresh install, if that simplifies things.\n\nA: You don't have to do that!\nAs you have read elsewhere the best answer is, don't mess with the system folders. You can move the /home folder to a dedicated partition in the HDD (your sdb) using the official help page However, I recommend keeping the /home as well as /home/[upir user ID] in the SSD as all your personal configuration files are there. Keeping the personal configuration in the SSD keeps the system snappy.\nSteam\nSteam games take up a lot of space. However, it does not keep the games in the system folders, such as /usr. Your steam games are in /home/[your user name]/.local/share/Steam. See Where are Steam games installed?\nSee Installing programs in root vs home partitions? for more on the how to use an SSD and HDD.\nFollow the instructions in Do I need Intel Smart Response when installing Ubuntu? to move some of your large personal folders like ~/.local/share/Steam to your hard drive and create symbolic links to the SSD.\nI recommend creating an ext4 partition in sdb so that file and folder permissions used by Ubuntu can be preserved. These will be lost if you dump the folders in a NTFS partition. See I want to reformat my home partition from ext3 to ntfs\nAlso see How to save applications for re-install or upgrade? for why moving some apps to a different partition and keeping the default apps in their original place is a bad idea.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How do I create simplistic window-like elements in a command-line program? When I execute sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm in the terminal I see a simplistic window-like listmenu. Is there an way to make something like that in C++?\nThis looks something like:\n\n\nA: The text-based window-like interface, contained within a terminal, that you see when you run sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm is coded using the ncurses library. So if you want your program to provide an interface that looks like that, you can use ncurses too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Here's the ncurses project page.\n\n*Here's an NCURSES Programming HOWTO.\n\n*You can install some ncurses documentation files with the ncurses-doc  package.\nThis includes the ncurses manpage, which you can also view online here. It also includes manual pages for all the functions provided by the ncurses library (some share a manpage). Those manpages are not currently online at manpages.ubuntu.com.\nTo build software using ncurses in Ubuntu, you should get the appropriate header files package. Unless you're cross-compiling, this will be:\n\n\n*\n\n*For programs using traditional strings where most characters are represented by a single byte (for example, UTF-8), use libncurses5 .\nThis is probably what you want if your strings are arrays of char (in C and other C-based languages) or std::string (in C++).\n\n*For programs requiring wide character support, use libncursesw5 .\nYou'll especially need this if your strings are arrays of wchar_t (in C and other C-based languages) or std::wstring, std::u16string, or std::u32string (in C++).\nOptionally, for help debugging your program, you might also want debug symbols (for debuggers such as gdb). For that, install libncurses5-dbg  or libncursesw5-dbg  too.\nSee also the ncurses in Ubuntu page on Launchpad, which contains a list of the major ncurses packages in Ubuntu as well as version information for each currently supported Ubuntu release.\nWhen you build your program with GCC (e.g., with the gcc or g++ commands), give it the argument -lncurses or -lncursesw, usually at the very end of the command. This links your program to the ncurses library. For example:\ng++ -Wall -g -o hello hello.cpp -lncurses\nThat compiles hello.cpp to produce an executable with debug symbols (-g), called hello (-o hello), warning on most things you might want a warning about (-Wall), and linking to the regular (not wide character) ncurses library (-lncurses).\n", "Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of mounting various directories on separate partitions? While installing Ubuntu with the \"something else\" option, I found out that there are many folders that can be mounted on separate partitions, as you can see in the image below.\n\nSo what are the advantages and disadvantages of mounting these folders(or directories) on separate partitions?\nSpecifically the directories are\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot\n\n*/home\n\n*/tmp\n\n*/usr\n\n*/var\n\n*/srv\n\n*/opt\n\n*/usr/local\n\nA: Long long time ago...\n... There was a time when people used to install Linux and configure it by hand for their specific needs. Some of this is true even today for servers. The choices you see in gparted are some of the popular ones for those who had very different needs as compared with the average desktop users, the intended audience for Ubuntu desktop.\nLet us take these one at a time. I will skip the ones I don't know much about.\n\n*\n\n*/boot There was a time when the Linux file system was fragile and hard drives were small. People were afraid that the hard drive would fill up or get corrupted and Ubuntu would't boot. Keeping the kernels in a separate partition helped the system to boot when other things went wrong. In those days, Linux users used to compile their own kernel and clean up old ones. As recently as with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, the Software Updater app installed the latest kernel update but did not remove the old kernels. As a result, a small /boot partition filled up with old kernels, and the system stopped booting unless one cleaned it periodically. See what happened if you had a separate /boot partition and forgot to clean it regularly: How do I free up more space in /boot? With Ubuntu 18.04 LTS the Software Updater app not only keeps the system up-to-date, but also removes the old kernels. It keeps the last two kernels in case the latest kernel has some issues and one needs to revert back to the previous one.\n\n*On the other hand, if you want to encrypt the / partition (to\nsafeguard the secret software you are working on), you will need a\nseparate (and unencrypted) /boot partition. Otherwise the system\nwon't boot. Similarly, if you have a RAID drive, keeping /boot in a non-RAID partition may be useful. Many people thinks having a separate /boot partition is a very good idea for these and other reasons.\n\n*/home Keeping home in a separate partition still makes some sense. This folder/partition has your personal files and having it in a separate partition allows you to format / and reinstall Ubuntu while keeping your files untouched. Recent versions of the Ubuntu installation software includes a choice of update from DVD/USB. This option keeps /home intact even it it is not on a separate partition. If you run out of space in your primary drive with / partition. You may want to add a new drive and create a single /home partition in the new drive.\n\n*/tmp is where temporary files go. If you are running a server that creates large temp files, they may fill up all the disk space and bring your server to a halt. Keeping it in a separate partition will only fill up that partition and may stop the process that was creating the big temp files but will not stop the rest of the system. I am told it is easier to deal with a filled up /tmp partition than a temporary folder under / partition.\n\n*/usr/, /opt/, and /usr/local are all places where programs and apps are kept under different conditions. If you develop software for Linux, it may make sense to keep these in separate partitions, so that if you reinstall Ubuntu, you won't delete the programs you have written or have been working on.\n\n*Keeping /opt/ and /usr/local in separate partition also makes\nsense if you install programs from source (your own or from\nsomewhere else) and want to use them in another distribution (say\nRed Hat) installed in the same computer in its own partition. Then\nboth the distributions, Ubuntu and Red Hat can share the /opt and\n/usr/local partitions. (Thanks Rmano!)\n\n*/srv and /var are particularly useful as separate partitions if you run servers or develop web pages. For the average desktop user these folders don't take up much space and does not hold anything that is of value to the user. For a web developer losing /var/www may mean losing her job.\n\nTo be sure, these are not the only directories one can mount as partitions. In Linux, one can mount a partition as any folder anywhere. Partitions are often mounted as sub-directories of /mnt/ and /media.\nHope this helps\n\nA: For desktop?\nNo difference.\nFor server?\nSpace management and backup.\nIf your system have many users you can make additional partition for /home/, then users will not exeed that space and root (/) will not be affected.\nYou can also mount NFS, SMB or partition on other physical disks on those folders. For example :\n/dev/sda1 /boot (1GB)\n/dev/sda2 / (60GB)\nnfs://IP/folder /home ( X TB )\n/dev/sdb1 /var (1TB for /var/www or /var/ftp)\nFor laptop\n/ on m-sata (fast)\n/var /home /opt /tmp on hdd (slow)\n\nA: przemo's answer, imo, most closely hits the practical points. Here are some additional practical considerations:\nEnterprise environments typically use separate partitions for at lease / , /home , /opt , /var , /boot , and additional filesystems (1 per application or application team) under /opt. This is primarily to avoid running the system out of space because of someone home directory getting massive (/home), logs going out of control (/var), or apps consuming tons of space (/opt , /opt// , etc), and /boot so that the other partitions can be built in LVM and also to ensure you can get something of a recovery shell should the primary system partition become corrupt for some reason. \nFor my own personal non-server uses, I just keep separate / , /boot , and /home partitions so that I can dual boot multiple Linux/UNIX OS's and use the same /home partition for them.\nIn the case of building a VM in Oracle Virtualbox, VMWare Player/Workstation/Fusion, etc for personal use, there really is no practical reason to have multiple partitions with different mount points on account of the nice folder sharing capabilities provided by at least VirtualBox and VMWare Player/Workstation/Fusion. The single exception might be /boot for the recovery shell reason given in my \"enterprise environment\" paragraph.\n\nA: If something goes really wrong during update or major version upgrade, having /home on a different partition allows you to boot from CD and then wipe completely and reinstall the operating system without losing your data.  Also, this makes multiple boot with various Linux distributions possible, some people like to evaluate these side by side.\n\nA: Generic advantages of having multiple partitions:\n\n*\n\n*You can use different disks/LUNs and have better performance. This can increase the performance of databases as you can have the transaction log on a storage and the data files on another. Similar for disk I/O intensive web applications.\n\n*You can use different mount options (that increase the security or affect the performance/stability in a more granular way).\n\n*You can have different filesystems.\n\n*You manage the space separately. So you can have a nasty application that fills the space that does not affect other applications.\n\n*Fragmentation of one partition is independent of the other.\n\n*You can snapshot, mount, unmount, format, defragment, monitor for performance of those file systems independently.\n\n*You can have encryption on specific volumes.\n\n*You can mount volumes on demand.\n\n*You can see I/O statistics per each block device.\n\nGeneric disadvantages of having multiple partitions:\n\n*\n\n*It increases the administration overhead.\n\n*You will have greater chances of wasting more disk space.\n\n*You will have more incidents involving disk full.\n\n*It is more difficult to create a consistent snapshot of an application running on different volumes.\n\n*It uses slightly more resources.\n\n*Difficult to shrink. Depending on the volume type (MS-DOS label, LVM, btrfs...) you might not be able to easily allocate space from a volume by shrinking another. Especially online.\n\n*If you partition so that you can use nodev, nosuid and/or noexec, this setup can be too limiting and you can obtain better granularity with SELinux, grsecurity, or AppArmor and just use a big /.\n\n*If you use old partitioning tools you can get \"creative\" and misalign partitions with underlying extents. Some disk arrays can detect this and compensate.\n\n*If you use all 4 primary partitions on a MS-DOS disk label, it will be difficult to create new partitions.\n\nAnother way to partition your system is to use LVM, btrfs, or zfs for /. Allocate just the minimum space for / and when needed create logical volumes or extend /. This leaves you the choice to split in volumes at a later time and has lower maintenance costs.\nWhen you have a new disk volume (disk, disk array, SAN LUN) you can use different disk labels (some can be mixed on top of the other):\n\n*\n\n*MS-DOS disk label. It is phased out, but still supported in a lot of machines\n\n*GPT. Used with EFI/UEFI, it is similar with MS-DOS disk label, but removes some limitations and adds some stability (backup, checksum)\n\n*LVM - used in Linux, recent versions of GRUB can boot a kernel located on LVM. Most of the people are using it on top of MS-DOS or GPT disk label, but I prefer to use it directly on the volume. This gives me the best flexibility.\n\n*other disk labels (BSD, SUN, Windows Dynamic Disks) may be used if you want to annoy your teammates.\n\n*ZFS, Btrfs‍ - are integrating a filesystem with the volume manager\n\n*format directly the volume with the file system you need. No disk label, like floppy disks.\n\nNow specific stuff:\n\n*\n\n*/boot is good to be a separate partition. The file system must be one supported by your boot loader (usually GRUB).\n\n*If you use EFI/UEFI it is a requirement to have a EFI system partition on a GPT disk label.\n\n*/home is good to separate the user stuff from the OS and applications.\n\n*/tmp can be mounted with noexec, nodev, nosuid. It can be a memory mapped file system like tmpfs.\n\n*/usr can be mounted read-only and only remounted RW for updates, it can be remote like a NFS share.\n\n*/srv/opt will store the application and application data. If you have an I/O intensive application you can use better disk subsystem (e.g. SSD)\n\n*/usr/local is the default used by applications installed locally on the current machine. For example you have everything else on NFS and have a local disk...\n\nThere is no perfect solution. If you have no clear reason why to create a new partition, then don't. The only partition you might need to create besides / is /boot.\nTry to use as few partitions as possible and allocate for them only what is required in near future (4-6 months). You can add more and expand them if needed. Use LVM, ZFS, or Btrfs directly on the disk volume, if possible. This gives you the best flexibility.\nFor desktops/laptops, it is nice to have /home on a separate partition so that you can reinstall the OS independent of your data.\n\nA: In addition to the existing answers, you may have non-standard/common compatibility and performance use cases that benefit from different partitions.\nYou may want to share data with another operating system such as Windows and need to use a filesystem that both Linux and supports.\nYou may have specialist use cases that allow you to have different tunings (of the same type of file system, such as an EXT4 partition for lots of small files and an EXT4 partition for few large file (such as virtual machines), its possible to optimise storage and performance for both use cases.\n", "Q: PCManFM custom directory icons I'd like PCManFM to show custom icons for my work folders;\nfor example to show the AndroidDev folder in this picture (italian locale here):\n\nlike this (Gimp used):\n\nI saw the other folder icons are located in the /usr/share/icons/Humanity/places/ directory; for example the Image folder icon is folder_images.svg (or folder-images.svg).\n\n\n*\n\n*How do PCManFM knows that for \"Immagini\" folder he has to use the folder-images.svg icon?\n\n*How can I instruct PCManFM to use for \"AndroidDev\" folder the folder-myicon.svg?\n\n\nA: Install the package xdg-user-dirs and then run xdg-user-dirs-update.

Personally I think it's still a viable encryption tool, as an ongoing, crowd-funded effort to do comprehensive audit of Truecrypt's code has not turned up any major problems after Phase 1.  It is supported on all major platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Android support is provided by 3rd party apps.

I am a windows user, and I don't know nothing about Ubuntu and how does it works. I don't know how to access my computer, I don't know how to access command prompt nothing. \nJust now I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, due to wifi problem I reinstalled Ubuntu and now the wifi is working fine. \nNow I am not able to install any of the exe file. I am trying to install file zilla,internet download manager, 7zip, and as a blogger I would like to install some other blogging related tools which install on Adobe Air. \nCan any one please help me and instruct me in detail step by step on how to install wine on Ubuntu 14.04. \nOr are there any other programs which makes to install windows related applications. \n\nA: Windows programs can not be run in Linux directly, both systems are too different.\nLinux has a ton of applications, FileZilla and 7zip for example are available as native Linux programs ready to install and use.\nIf you want to use windows programs on Linux than you need to install a runtime environment like Wine. Installation instructions can be found here (WineHQ).\nPlease note that you still need to have a license for all applications you use in wine.\n\nA: *\n\n*Read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal to learn how to start and use a terminal for the command prompt (implied question)\n\n*Once you have a terminal, type these two commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine\nThe first one refreshes the list of packages; the second does the actual installation.\nThis method will give you the Ubuntu version of Wine, which may not be quite as up to date as the version given by the method recommended in the previous answer by Jan.\n\nA: First of all, as You've been working with Windows, You have to understand that Ubuntu has totally different way of installing applications. Ok, maybe not so totally, but I will explain it later. Also applications are often different. \nHere we mostly use repositories about which You can read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_repository . It's generally the 'storage location' from which files are downloaded and automatically installed. They are also used to keep installed applications up to date. \nHonestly for me this way is a lot of more comfortable then on Windows. Here You just need to type one command or open Ubuntu Software Center application (Synaptic in future maybe), find application You want, click 'install', type Your password and... that's all You have to do. What's more it also automatically check if there's newer version of application and kindly asks You about permission to update it. \nWhen some application is not available in Your current set of repositories You just add new one to the list. Don't worry now - most of typical applications are in default repositories.  \nTo be honest, while installing application from repository it just automatically downloads correct .deb file and installs it. That means that You can always manually download .deb file You want and install it. \nOk, now answering Your real question.\nYou can install Wine by opening 'Ubuntu Software Center' from Dash, finding this application, clicking install and typing Your password. That's only one way to deal with it, but I guess that the easiest one.\nAnyway the thing is You probably do not really need Wine now. Just type 'filezilla', 'download manager' and anything alse You want in Ubuntu Software Center. There can be some problem with Adobe Air but I believe that if You search about it, You will find solution or alternative. \nHope that helps. :)\n", "Q: How to force Shotwell re-read metadata from images? I have some odd behavior of Shotwell: some of my ratings of a recent event photos have disappeared from the Shotwell's database. \nMost of the photos that I had rated two stars are listed as not rated in Shotwell. However the file of the photo does say \"rating 2\", and Digikam as well confirms the rating is 2 when I reload the metadata from the photos.\nIs there a way to force Shotwell to re-read the metadata from the photos and overwrite what's in the database?\nThank you!\n\nA: Looks that there is no function for rebuilding database from photo files (in version 0.24.5 which I am using). The only way is probably delete the db file located ~/.local/share/shotwell/data/photo.db. After restarting Shotwell you should make a new import.\n\nA: Not sure if it would work for ratings, but I read a while that a trick to force thumbnail regeneration was selecting everything, mirror (or rotate, or whatever you want), and then undo the operation. That forces Shotwell to re-read the file, and might fix your problem.\nIt's pretty weird, though, because, I've even edited tags, rotation or whatever from external tools, and Shotwell has always managed to update its information.\n\nA: I had a slightly different issue but maybe it helps you too: I updated the CreateDate using exiftools but Shotwell would not recognize it.\nIt turned out that I had configured Shotwell to save all metadata to files. So every time I used exiftool Shotwell would just override my settings because it had stored something else in its database.\nI switched of the option to save metadata in images and now it recognizes my changes made with exiftool.\n", "Q: change grub setting from readonly to normal Yesterday, I had installed Ubuntu Desktop in my system which already had Windows XP.

Hence I try to change the timeout in in /etc/default/grub. But I am unable to change as it say it is write-protected.

But this made no apparent change.  I also cannot ping the router from either VM.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: Its difficult to answer without more information.\nAs your on the same network, I don't expect firewall rules to be an issue.\nAre you using neutron or nova.\nCan you check all the neutron services are running ok?\nneutron agent-list\n\nIt maybe worthwhile enabling dhcp, so that you can at least verify if the network is functioning.\nAlso are the VMs co-located on the same physical hypervisor, or are they spread across two.  If they are spread across two, then are you using VLANs and have you configured your switch to support it ?\nIts worth pointing out that statically configuring IPs, not reserved by Openstack worked prior to Icehouse, but changes in that release maybe causing you problems.\nOn the compute node hosting one of the VMs if you run\niptables -S | more\n\nSearch the output for your VMs MAC address e.g. mine is 'FA:16:3E:D0:1A:5D'\nYou will se some output like this:\n-A neutron-openvswi-see719639-9 -s 192.168.0.83/32 -m mac --mac-source FA:16:3E:BB:75:7E -j RETURN\n-A neutron-openvswi-see719639-9 -j DROP\n\nThis means it will only accept packets to that MAC address destined for 192.168.0 .83/32.\n\nA: I believe this is consistent with my previous experimentation with trying to have a statically configured IP address on a neutron DHCP-enabled network.  As I recall, what you are trying to do works if DHCP has been disabled for that particular neutron network, but will not work if it has been enabled.\nIn the case of the latter, a neutron port will be created for this VM interface with the IP assigned IP address.  If you were to statically configure your guest VM to match this IP & subnet, it would work.  If you try to statically configure your guest for an IP other than the IP in the neutron database, it will not.  If nothing else, this is a form of IP spoof protection as it would not allow you to impersonate the IP of another VM on the same network, and is generally a good protection to have.\nSo, one option is to use a network with DHCP = disabled for your network.  Another option is to statically configure the VM for the same IP that neutron has assigned.\nOne other anecdote: In one case I bridged an external network to an openstack network through a particular VLAN.  This network had only statically configured physical servers, and no DHCP server.  The openstack-side network I created with DHCP=enabled.  I did this using a restricted allocation_range, to allocate IPs that would not be in conflict with existing static IPs on the same CIDR.  Because neutron only manages bridged ports for VMs, this meant that other statically configured devices on the network (outside of openstack/neutron control) could talk to the DHCP'ed VMs on this network.  But, this setup would not allow you to spin up a mix of static and DHCP VM/guests on the same neutron network that has DHCP=enabled.\n", "Q: Synaptic freezes at start this is a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04, using Gnome Flashback Mode. Synaptic made problems from the beginning, directly after its installation.\nUbuntu 12.04, which is installed in parallel, never had problems with Synaptic.\nAfter starting synaptic, the left list is populated while the loading bar is displayed at the bottom.

Why when an installation fails, should I run dpkg --configure -a, to fix it, also, why can't sudo apt do this?\n\nA: apt, aptitude, synaptic etc. are frontends to the same tool: dpkg. dpkg is very low-level, and apt isn't particularly smart. So if package configuration was interrupted, apt tells you to descend to the lower level to fix it. Note that apt may not be aware of the packages which caused the problem (they may be manually installed local packages, and they may be a hundred packages and not one) and keeping it simple, it tells you to use the tool that is aware of them. Mitch has already posted what this command does.\n\nA: From the manpage:\n--configure package...|-a|--pending\n          Reconfigure an unpacked package. If -a  or  --pending  is  given\n          instead  of  package, all unpacked but unconfigured packages are\n          configured.\n\n          Configuring consists of the following steps:\n\n          1. Unpack the conffiles, and at the same time back  up  the  old\n          conffiles, so that they can be restored if something goes wrong.\n\n          2.

And possibly the only reason I still use FAT32, would be that some startup disk creators (perhaps the Startup Disk Creator as well) format the drive to FAT32.\n\n\nGiven cross-platform support is not a limitation, there is absolutely no reason to use FAT32. In fact the only reason to use ext4 is that btrfs is not quite there yet.\n", "Q: Chrome/Chromium causes laggy touchpad on lubuntu 14.04 at MacBook I'm running Lubuntu at quite an old MacBook (6.1). Trying to keep it up-to-date so for the moment it's 14.04.\nSeveral months ago (after one of the updates) a strange problem arose: at a random moment of time touchpad becomes veeeery laggy so there's absolutely no way you can continue working - the only thing to help is a reboot.

Is the Amazon feature that comes bundled with Ubuntu standard installations inherent to all Ubuntu derivatives (like e.g. Mint, Xubuntu, etc), or is it only present in the vanilla Ubuntu Desktop version?\nCan anyone recommend a distribution that doesn't have the Amazon desktop feature?\n\nA: The official derivatives of Ubuntu really are Ubuntu. If that makes you not want to use them, there's nothing wrong with that, but for other OS recommendations I'd suggest asking in a community that's not all about Ubuntu--our suggestions for non-Ubuntu OSes might lack some important insights. Furthermore, there are many OSes in the world, even many that are substantially similar to Ubuntu, so what you're looking for might be a broad discussion, rather than answers to a narrowly scoped question. With that said...\nIf you want to know which official derivatives of Ubuntu ship without software that automatically sends personal data to Canonical to search Amazon, that question can certainly be answered. The functionality you're trying to avoid is provided by the unity-lens-shopping package. This is a Unity lens, and it is absent by default in derivatives that don't use Unity at all.\n(Of course you can also simply uninstall that package and log out and back in, but I understand that's not the solution you're looking for.)\nUbuntu flavors not shipping with Unity (and thus also not with unity-lens-shoppping) currently are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu GNOME (GNOME 3 with GNOME Shell, not Unity)\n\n*Kubuntu (KDE Plasma)\n\n*Lubuntu (LXDE)\n\n*Mythbuntu (currently uses Xfce)\n\n*Ubuntu Studio (currently uses Xfce)\n\n*Xubuntu (Xfce)\n\n\nI've listed these in the same order as they appear here, and excluded Unity-based flavors.\nWhile I encourage you to seek other sources of information about other distributions, two distributions similar to Ubuntu are very popular: Debian, our upstream distro (i.e., Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian), and Linux Mint, a popular unofficial derivative of Ubuntu. (Linux Mint also offers a version based directly on Debian instead of Ubuntu.)\nWhile they don't have huge user bases, I'd consider two unofficial derivatives of Ubuntu (besides Mint) to be particularly notable: Trisquel GNU/Linux, which includes only free software (the current stable version is based on Ubuntu 12.04); and Ubuntu MATE, which uses the MATE desktop and might get official status.\nI understand this answer does not give everything you're looking for, and I reiterate the need to consult people and resources outside the Ubuntu community for a balanced picture of which OSes may be most appropriate for your needs. However, I think the question of which \"Ubuntus\" ship without Amazon search integration is of interest to many people; perhaps some of them will be helped.\n", "Q: How can I speed up finding available wifi networks?

Sometimes I have to wait 15+ seconds to see my hotspot even though my phone and tablet can already see it (so I know the network is available well before Ubuntu sees it).\nIs there any way to get a \"refresh\" option added to the wifi options in the network drop down list, or to decrease the time between scans for open networks? \n\nA: The best answer might be from here:\nGo to the command line and type:\nsudo iwlist wlan0 scan\n\nAssuming your wifi is called wlan0 (it might be wlan0 or something else) see ifconfig for details.\nThis command will refresh the list by asking the wifi to rescan. You can only do this as root and if you do it as non-root it will simply print the list of known networks without refreshing.\n\nA: Click the WiFi icon on the top menu bar, uncheck \"Enable Wifi\", this will disable your WiFi. Go back to the top menu and click the WiFi icon and recheck \"Enable WiFi\" to re-enable your WiFi. The available networks list will automatically repopulate.\n", "Q: ubuntu Server asus chromebox won't boot unless I have a hdmi display plugged in So I installed Ubuntu Server on my Asus Chromebox, all works great except I have a strange issue.\nUbuntu won't boot unless I have a hdmi display plugged in\nI've tested this over and over.

For the Linux apps I wanted to practice/study, but the guidelines say to only use Nexus/4/7/10 tablets. They all have Droid_4.2 thru 4.4, btw. \nWhy does it matter which tablet I'd choose to modify?  \n\nA: With tablets and smartphones, hardware support becomes a big issue.  While hardware support for Linux on desktop PCs is not as much of an issue these days, tablet and smartphone manufacturers have an \"embedded\" mentality where a lot of hardware requires drives that are not openly available, and if they are, it isn't legal for someone else to use them in their OS.\nModern smartphones and tablets have lots of different hardware included, from cameras to motion sensors, GPS devices, touch screens, bluetooth transceivers, light sensors, proximity sensors, phone codecs, and more.\nThere is also the issue of fragmentation: different devices have very different types of hardware, varying to a much greater degree than desktop/laptop PCs.\nWhen someone releases an alternative operating system for a modern smartphone or tablet, they are faced with the challenge of tracking down drivers for each and every one of the hardware devices on that smartphone or tablet, or simply not supporting some devices, or reverse-engineering their own drivers, and so on.  Or, extracting the drivers from the stock OS on the device  (where it can be difficult to determine what is legal and what isn't).\nSo alternative OSes on smartphones and tablets usually only support certain device models.\nNote that there are \"community ports\" of Ubuntu touch to other device models - these are not officially supported but try to get most/some hardware working on devices other than those officially supported Nexus devices.  The main reason they are not officially supported by Ubuntu is the unknown legal status of the drivers that need to be \"borrowed\" in order to get hardware working on those devices.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices\n", "Q: Accents and tilde on Firefox are not above letters I've recently installed Kubuntu 14.04 64bits on my Aspire 4752, where I had a Lubuntu 14.04 with /home partition.\nEverything works fine, and I can type Portuguese accents and tildes on other programs, including Chrome, but in Firefox, when I type an accent, it appears before the letter, so when I type the vowel, they are not together, like á, but like ´a.\nThe ç, however, is working fine (majority of internet complains about Firefox and keyboard problems are about ç).\nTried different Firefox extensions to type diacritics, and followed all Google tutorials, but couldn't solve it.\nIs there some way to solve this problem?\nEdit: now I noticed that google chrome does it some times, but if I close it and open, it may do it or not randomly.\n\nA: Someone having a similar problem could solve it by removing a symlink to a system config directory:\nHe had a link ~/.xinput.d pointing to /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/scim,\nand fixed the problem by removing it, so try removing it if you have that link.

When you log in, you can select them by clicking the icon to the right of your username.\nIf I log in under Ubuntu(Default), I can get it transparent.  If I switch to GNOME, I can't.  However, if I log in under GNOME classic,(can't figure out how to open a terminal with that one yet).   \nUnder GNOME flashback, I get intermediate behavior.\nIt appears that \"transparent background\" means something different in flashback.  If you move the terminal shell around on the screen, you'll see that the the terminal is transparent to the desktop background.  \nThis is especially obvious if you set your desktop to a wallpaper.  Howeve, the terminal shell still blocks out the icons that you may have put on your desktop, as well as other windows open.\nMetacity has the same behavior as flashback.\nSo, it's possible that if you want a transparent shell, you may be restricted in your desktop background.\n", "Q: How can I install & run testdisk with USB How can I install & run testdisk with USB?\nWhen I boot from HDD, i can download & install testdisk from ubuntu software center; but when I boot from USB (for the purpose of recovering my NTFS drives that were accidentally dissolved into one EXT4 by 14.04) I can not even find testdisk inside ubuntu software center. So can not run testdisk from terminal when I boot from USB.\nIs booting from USB a MUST for trying to recover NTFS drives?\nPlease help I am badly confused :(    :`(\n\nA: As muru has mentioned, you need to enable the universe repos to install testdisk in Ubuntu.  However, I would recommend using one of the Live Rescue CDs listed here instead, rather than an Ubuntu cd/usb.  They're basically Linux distros that come with a ton of data recovery/repair programs installed, including testdisk. \nThe advantage of this is that you have a ton of programs dedicated to data recovery all in one place, but more importantly, many of them are configured to never touch the HDD during boot.  When you're doing data recovery, the more you access/modify the data on the drive, the less likely you'll be able to recover data. Ubuntu accesses the hard disk quite a bit during boot, even when using a live cd/usb, which makes it not quite ideal for data recovery purposes.\n", "Q: No Sound on Saved Media Playback The sound works when playing streaming videos.

For the sake of experimentation, I am trying to document a minimal procedure for a pure EFI boot of 14.04 on a Mac Mini.\nThis involves installing a base system (using the Mac-flavoured server install ISO) to the hard drive, but NOT installing GRUB to the MBR. GRUB is installed to the first partition of the hard drive, but until I manually set up the EFI boot partition, the system will be unbootable.\nIs there a way to use the bootloader on the USB installer to boot into the installed system manually? I have access to \"advanced options\" (ie. the bootloader command line) on the installer, but I don't know what bootloader it is, and so I can't find full documentation for it.\n\nA: Don't use the Mac-specific installer. Use the normal (server, desktop) installer, install the system using all the defaults (except avoid LVM), and then reboot.\nBoot off the USB installer again, but when you see the GRUB menu, press C to bring up the GRUB console.\nFinding your installation's drive\nAt the GRUB console, do\ngrub> ls\n(memdisk) (hd0) (hd0,msdos) (hd1) (hd2) (hd2,gpt3) (hd2,gpt2) (hd2,gpt1)\n\nYou may not get exactly the same results as this, but you'll have some options. You want to look for your new installation, not the installer/live system. I suggest finding a partition with your new user's home directory on it:\ngrub> ls (hd2,gpt2)/home\njason/\n\nKeep trying this pattern until you find it.\nFinding your installation's boot partition\nIf you know you installed everything to one partition, you're done — just use the result from the last step, the (hdX,gptY). If you didn't, or you're unsure, keep the hdX part, but go through all the gptY options looking for a /boot/grub directory:\ngrub> ls (hd2,gpt1)/boot/grub\nerror: file `/boot/grub' not found.\n\nNope, not that one.\ngrub> ls (hd2,gpt2)/boot/grub\nunicode.pf2 [...] grub.cfg\n\nFound it!\nNow you want to set this as your root for further commands:\ngrub> set root=(hd2,gpt2)\n\nFiguring out the boot command\nI found that the only way to boot properly was to use the UUID of the drive (ie. no shortcuts with /dev/sdaX!) - so let's get that:\ngrub> ls -l (hd2,gpt2)\n        Partition hd2,gpt2: Filesystem type ext* [...snip...] UUID e86c20b9-83e1-447d-a3be-d1ddaad6c4c6 - Partition start at [...]\n\nNote the UUID string! Yours will be different. Now tell GRUB where Linux is:\ngrub> linux /boot/vmlinuz[...tab here!...].efi.signed root=UUID=<the UUID from above>\n\nThe GRUB console can do tab completion, so if you just type out the vmlinuz part and hit tab, then hit . and tab again... you won't have to type out the whole filename. But do make sure the .efi.signed bit is there! And yes, you will have to type out that whole UUID.\nNow set the initrd (initial RAM disk):\ngrub> initrd /boot/initrd[...tab here!...]\n\nBooting\nType:\ngrub> boot\n\nYou should find yourself booted into your installation!\n\nI'm no GRUB wizard, so I'd welcome any tips on how to trim this down.

But now the laptop cannot detect the windows installation disc. When I put in the disc and restart, nothing changed; it still went directly into Xubuntu without any option. I'm sure nothing is wrong with BIOS since I have checked it many times. When I insert Ubuntu installation disc and restart, it shows the options perfectly. What should I do in order to install windows on my laptop?\n\nA: You need to specifically configure your BIOS to boot from the CD drive.\nHow to do this varies according to your system.  Sometimes F12 during initial boot is all that is required to bring up a menu, from which you choose the CD drive as the boot drive.\nOther times you'll need to go into the regular BIOS setup (using a key like F2, esc or del) and find where the boot devices are configured.  You may have to both enable the CD drive as a boot drive, and ensure that it is higher in the boot priority than your hard drive.\nAfter your OS is installed if you have no other reason to boot from CD you can then un-do whatever settings you changed.\n", "Q: Stuck in low-graphics mode, normal method not working I just got a notification to take the Ubuntu 14.04 update.

The reason I ask is that it seems like the drive will only work with my laptop (which was used to install linux on the external drive) and it will not boot on other machines.  \n\n\nI'm sorry for the confusing questions.  I don't know much of other ways to explain the issue.  I wish there was a way to use multiple external drives on my laptop so I can use different distros without having to install multiple distros on one hard drive.  \nThe routine I use for installing on external hard drive is as follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot a live-usb on my laptop.\n\n*create / boot partition on the external drive I want to install on.\n\n*create / partition on the external-drive I want to install on. \n\n*Select sdb (which is my external drive, where i want the boot partion to be).\n\n\nI want to make it clear that this will work fine as long as I don't plug in a different linux-external-drive into my laptop.  the minute I do that, I will get the message above and neither drive will boot.

I'm a web programmer that has finally been tasked with setting up a development server for in house development and testing. I'm a novice when it comes to setting up a LAMP server. I've only ever managed to do the default LAMP stack with \"tasksel\", never managed to get multiple domains working properly. \nWhat I would like to know is, is it possible to drop a single config file for a single domain/subdomain in a directory in order to configure it? I have a feeling this is how you use the directory /sites-available/ right? \nAny tips in the right direction are greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Yes, that is indeed how multiple subdomains are managed in Apache. You created a configuration in sites-available, and then enable them using the a2ensite command. For example, I have a local Ubuntu mirror and a repository set up on the same server: mirror  (saved as /etc/apache2/sites-available/default.conf)and repo (saved as /etc/apache2/sites-available/repo.conf. Then I enable them thus (sudo or root needed):\na2ensite default\na2ensite repo\nservice apache2 reload\n\nWith proper DNS configuration, now repo.fqdn and mirror.fqdn, while resolving to the same IP, open the correct sites.\n", "Q: How long is an ARP entry cached for? Where can I find out how long ARP table entries are cached? I'm running 13.10.

That means 60 seconds until the entry is removed. Every time the entry is used in the table, the timer for this entry resets to 60 seconds.\nAdditionally you can set it by:\necho 3600 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/gc_stale_time\n\nOr permantent in the config file /etc/sysctl.conf.\n", "Q: Uninstall Windows 8.1 to run Ubuntu 14.04 as the single OS on my laptop? From the beginning I had Windows 8.1 installed on my laptop. Then I installed Ubuntu 14.04 alongside Windows by shrinking a drive on Windows and installing Ubuntu by usb to the latter one. Now I want to uninstall windows 8.1 to run Ubuntu 14.04 as the single OS on my laptop. If I uninstall windows 8.1, do I still have Ubuntu 14.04 on my boot options? Or I need to do something else? \n\nA: I would advice to keep the W8 recovery partition that probably is on your system intact. You never know if you want to turn back.\nYou have several options. The most common 3:\n\n*\n\n*re-install Ubuntu 14.04 and during partitioning remove all the partitions you want to use and re-partition them as wanted (whatever rocks your boat: / or / swap or / swap /home or / swap /home /etc /boot). You can do that automatically or manually. In the  end all is used for Ubuntu. Problem: this will remove your current Ubuntu and its files.\nIf that is not wanted...\n\n\n*Burn and boot a gParted live dvd. Remove all unwanted partitions and after that is done choose to resize the partition that is adjecent to the unallocated space. That will probably be the root partition. After this is done the space from the Windows partition will become available to Ubuntu (Option 4: you can only do resizing to adjecent partitions; if you want it added to another partition you need to shrink and enlarge partitions several times; this will take a lot of time depending on how full your system is).\n\n\n*Burn and boot a gParted live dvd. Remove all unwanted partitions and after this is done format the unallocated space as EXT4 and give it a mountpoint. That way you end up with an extra partition and can freely use that space after you changed the owner and group to your user (chown $USER:$USER /media/{mountpont}/.\nThe reason I advice a live gparted is that this makes sure all partitions are unmounted and you can change the partitions at will.\n\nA: Boot ubuntu and open a terminal, run\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nOpen this in the dash (top left) and right click your windows partitio\nChoose delete click the green tick to apply, this will make just blank space, you can format this to what ever you like.\nThen do this in a terminal and reboot\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Custom theme sidebar I'm new to linux, and I recently installed ubuntu on my notebook with dual boot.

I've configured all apps to start at specific desktops, with terminals at desktop 1, Spacefm at desktop 2, and then finally, Google Chrome at desktop 4.\nAll of the programs start at the correct desktop, other than Google Chrome. Can't seem to get it to start at desktop 4. When starting Chrome, it will start at the current desktop, not at desktop 4. Excerpt from my rc.xml file:\n    <application name=\"/usr/bin/google-chrome\">\n  <desktop>4</desktop>\n  <layer>normal</layer>\n  <decor>no</decor>\n  <maximized>no</maximized>\n</application>\n\nI know that Chrome is originally installed to /opt/google/chrome/chrome, I've tried using that path, aswell as the /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome wrapper script.

I have also tried having multiple entries in the rc.xml, in total 3 entries, the with the before mentioned binary locations.\nHow do I get Chrome to start at desktop 4?\n\nA: The problem lies with your window matching rules. You have to set the application name to the window name as reported by xprop. This is the relevant xprop output for a Chrome window:\n_OB_APP_TYPE(UTF8_STRING) = \"normal\"\n_OB_APP_TITLE(UTF8_STRING) = \"Untitled - Google Chrome\"\n_OB_APP_GROUP_CLASS(UTF8_STRING) = \n_OB_APP_GROUP_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = \n_OB_APP_CLASS(UTF8_STRING) = \"Google-chrome\"\n_OB_APP_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = \"Google-chrome\"\n_OB_APP_ROLE(UTF8_STRING) = \"browser\"\n\nSo to match all Google chrome windows you would have to write a rule like this:\n<application name=\"Google-chrome\" class=\"Google-chrome\" type=\"normal\">\n  <desktop>4</desktop>\n  <layer>normal</layer>\n  <decor>no</decor>\n  <maximized>no</maximized>\n</application>\n\nThe class and type attributes are optional, but it's always good to be more specific so that other windows don't get falsely matched.\nMake sure to insert your new rule in the <applications>..</applications> section and refresh openbox (openbox --reconfigure) to apply the changes.\n", "Q: No wireless networks found in wicd I have a laptop ThinkPad Edge E430, with Xubuntu 12.04.4 LTS installed on it.

Since duplicate questions might (and do) appear, it might be useful nevertheless.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy either one of the scripts into an empty file, save it as reorganize.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the targeted directory (with the files to reorganize):\nreorg_dir = \"/path/to/directory_to_reorganize\" \n\n(use quotes if the directory contains spaces)\npossible extensions you'd like to exclude (probably none, like below):\nexclude = ()\n\nand if you'd like to remove empty folders afterwards:\nremove_emptyfolders = True\n\n\n*Run the script with the command:\npython3 /path/to/reorganize.py\n\nNB if you'd like to copy the files instead of move, replace:\nshutil.move(subject, new_dir+\"/\"+name)\n\nby:\nshutil.copy(subject, new_dir+\"/\"+name)\n\nPlease try first on a small sample.\n\nA: You can use find with a somewhat complex exec command:\nfind . -iname '*?.?*' -type f -exec bash -c 'EXT=\"${0##*.}\"; mkdir -p \"$PWD/${EXT}_dir\"; cp --target-directory=\"$PWD/${EXT}_dir\" \"$0\"' {} \\;\n\n# '*?.?*' requires at least one character before and after the '.', \n# so that files like .bashrc and blah. are avoided.\n# EXT=\"${0##*.}\" - get the extension\n# mkdir -p $PWD/${EXT}_dir - make the folder, ignore if it exists\n\nReplace cp with echo for a dry run.\n\nMore efficient and tidier would be to save the bash command in a script (say, at  /path/to/the/script.sh):\n#! /bin/bash\n\nfor i\ndo\n    EXT=\"${i##*.}\" \n    mkdir -p \"$PWD/${EXT}_dir\"\n    mv --target-directory=\"$PWD/${EXT}_dir\" \"$i\" \ndone\n\nAnd then run find:\nfind . -iname '*?.?*' -type f -exec /path/to/the/script.sh {} +\n\nThis approach is pretty flexible. For example, to use the filename instead of the extension (filename.ext), we'd use this for EXT:\nNAME=\"${i##*/}\"\nEXT=\"${NAME%.*}\"\n\n", "Q: cannot ccompile the basic opencv cpp program I made the ~/.compile_opencv.sh as given https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV on this website and then I made this file opencvtest.cpp with the following contents .

I can't break it!  For instance, if I copy /usr/bin/okular to /usr/bin/fooooo and call that new executable, the window thus created still gets the okular icon, even though there is no fooooo.png or fooooo.desktop, or any .desktop with Name=fooooo or Exec=fooooo. \nWhere is the association between the executable and the icon made?\n\nNOTE: The point is not for the icon to appear on the desktop.\nIt makes no difference to me whether it appears there or not.\n(My desktop shows the contents of my home directory.)\n\nA: This isn't happening!

Since RAM is not necessarily fast compared to the\n  computer's processor, RAM latency can occur, causing a delay between\n  the time a computer's hardware recognizes the need for a RAM access\n  (initiates a request for data) and the time the data or instruction is\n  available to the processor. If the CPU requests data that is not\n  stored in the cache, then it will have to wait for the RAM to retrieve\n  the data, opening the door to latency problems.\n\nWhere to check Latency of RAM  ?\nFor Ubuntu install package  i2c-tools and run\nsudo modprobe eeprom\ndecode-dimms\n\nSource : Ubuntu Forums & Major Source\nI hope it will help you.\n\nA: On my old Dell Vostro 3700 notebook, with Ubuntu 20.04, 'decode-dimms' worked for me (with 'modprobe eeprom'); it returned a bunch of info like:\nFundamental Memory type                          DDR3 SDRAM\nModule Type                                      SO-DIMM\n...\nMaximum module speed                             1333 MHz (PC3-10600)\n...\nMinimum Cycle Time (tCK)                         1.500 ns\nMinimum CAS Latency Time (tAA)                   13.125 ns\n\nFrom Crucial site: \"latency (ns) = clock cycle time (ns) x number of clock cycles\"; so, to find CL class (number of clock cycles), divide \"Minimum CAS Latency Time\" (latency) by \"Minimum Cycle Time\" (clock cycle time): the nearest integer should be the CL value (I got 8.75, and CL9 should be consistent with my RAM modules).\nBeware: 'decode-dimms' may not output infos on DDR4 systems without finding the correct module needed to read the new SPD Flash memory and it seems to work only on recent Linux releases as wrote Guilherme Parreira above; it may even show you infos about MAXIMUM performances of memory modules, not the actual values they are using.

Having contacted Skype, I've been informed that my OS is now outdated but that I may be able to download a compatible version in a fortnight or so.\nMeanwhile, I recently tried to update Frostwire (which had stopped working for some reason). I uninstalled and attempted to reinstall it, however, every time I attempted to do so I got the same message:\n(Reading database ... 161198 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking frostwire (from .../frostwire-5.7.6.all.deb) ...\ndpkg-deb: file `/home/david/Downloads/frostwire-5.7.6.all.deb' contains ununders\ntood data member data.tar.xz     , giving up\ndpkg: error processing /home/david/Downloads/frostwire-5.7.6.all.deb (--install)\n:\n subprocess dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile returned error exit status 2\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /home/david/Downloads/frostwire-5.7.6.all.deb\n\nBasically, I have two questions:\n1) Is it time I upgraded my OS? \nDistribution name & version is Linux Mint 9 Isadora.

You should update your OS. Mint 9 ended it's support in April 2013 according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_Mint_releases.\n2.\nI believe the problems you had installing skype and frostwire will be fixed with a newer OS, like mint 17 (yes, the newest is number 17).\n", "Q: Is the tilde, `~` considered to be a relative path?

You can see this between the following commands:\n$ echo -extract=~/test\n-extract=~/test\n\noli@bert:~$ echo -extract ~/test\n-extract /home/oli/test\n\nBash looks for standalone ~ characters and ~/ for this substitution. No other combination or quoted version will work.\n$HOME works because variable substitutions are more robust (the $ is a special character whereas ~ is very much less so):\n$ echo Thisisastring${HOME}awrawr\nThisisastring/home/oliawrawr\n\nWhile we're talking about ~, it actually has another couple of other substitution uses:\n\n\n*\n\n*~+ the current working directory (read from $PWD)\n\n*~- the previous working directory (read from $OLDPWD)\n\n\nAs with plain ~, these can have additional paths tacked on the end, and again, these have to be the prefix to a word or Bash will ignore them.\nYou can read more about this in man bash | less -p '   Tilde'\n\nA: ~ is not a path per se. It's a character that gets special treatment from the shell where ~ or ~/ means \"replace with current user's home directory path\". ~username means \"replace with username's home directory path\".\nBecause it's not a path, it's only recognized in certain places in the command (as the first character of a new space-split token).\nWhen expanded, it it replaced with an absolute path.\nUsing $HOME works because HOME is just a variable set by the shell and follows normal shell rules for variable replacement (it happens before the input is split on spaces and executed).\n\nA: Just fixing it\nThis command shows an error message \"ERROR: extract: path must be absolute\": \n./cuda_6.5.14_linux_64.run -extract=~/Downloads/nvidia_installers\n\nThe error is not helpful - the programm was too confused already.\nYou already know the error is from the ~, as it works with $HOME instead.  \nThe problem: ~ only gets replaced at the start of a word. \nFor example, this works with the tilde:\necho -extract ~/Downloads\n\nIf you need the option syntax with =, using $HOME instead of ~ is the most clean solution;   \necho -extract=$HOME/Downloads\n\nThe practice\nWhat you should know:\nThere are special cases where ~ get's expanded when not at the beginning of a word: as part of a variable assignment, directly after the =. Which is confusing here, of course.\nThe other important special case it for use with variables like PATH. In variable assignments, ~ is also expanded after :, like after the first =.\n$ dir=~ sh -c 'echo D2: $dir'\nD2: /home/user\n$ sh -c 'echo D2: $dir' dir=~\nD2: \n$ echo Dir: $dir\nDir:\n$ dir=~; sh -c 'echo D2: $dir'\nD2: \n$ echo Dir: $dir\nDir: /home/user\n$ sh -c 'echo D2: $dir'; d3=~\nD2: \n$ echo d3: $d3\nd3: /home/user\n\nThe meaning of the tilde\nIn a shell, ~, the tilde, is not really a path. It is only replaced by a path, $HOME, some times.\nIt is something like a shorthand, or abbreviation, provided by the shell.\nIt can not be used like a path in general, the shell \"expands\" it to a path only in very special places.\nAnd even if it is expanded, it can be to something else than the home directory.  \n\n\n*\n\n*It is only expanded at the beginning of a word, or in a variable assignment after a : or =\n\n*It is only expanded if it is not inside quotes\n\n*It is only expanded to $HOME if there are no further characters in the word before a /\nThe problem in the command line\nAccording to this, the problem in your command is that the tilde in  \n-extract=~/Downloads/nvidia_installers \nis not expanded, because it is not one of the cases listed. That's all.\nThe solution could be to make the tilde the first unquoted character of a word, with no other character before the next / - that is just what you get when you use an option with a space before the option argument:\n-extract ~/Downloads/nvidia_installers \nAnother solution would be to use $HOME instead. In a script, that is usually the better choice. \n-extract=$HOME/Downloads/nvidia_installers \nThe error message\nBut how does the error message\n\"ERROR: extract: path must be absolute.\"?\nfit into all this?\nWe know that the tilde did not get expanded. That means the program got the argument text including the ~, but without the /home/auser as the path. That path is ~/Downloads/nvidia_installers - but now there is no shell, so the tilde has no special meaning. It is just a normal directory name. And as every other path of the form foo/bar/baz, it is a relative path\nOther uses\nIf there are characters after the ~, as in ~alice - with all the other rules above applying - and there is a user names alice, that is expanded to the home directory of alice instead, say home/alice.\nAlso, if you are bob, ~ would expand to /home/bob, and ~bob would expand to the same.\nThe variant ~+ is expanded to the current directory, $PWD\nTo refer to the previous directory, where you were before the last cd, you can use ~-, which is expanded to $OLDPWD.\nIf you use pushd and popd, instead of cd, you will already know that the directory stack can be accessed like ~-2.\nDetails\nAll the cases where ~ is expanded to a path are handeled by the shell. For other programs, ~ is just a normal filename character. \nFor the exact definition inside the shell, here is the relevant section of man bash\nNote how replacing ~ by $HOME is just one special case of many cases: \"If this login name  is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the shell parameter HOME.\":\nTilde Expansion\n    If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`~'), all of the charac‐\n    ters  preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if there is no\n    unquoted slash) are considered a tilde-prefix.  If none of  the  characters\n    in  the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix follow‐\n    ing the tilde are treated as a possible login name.  If this login name  is\n    the  null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the shell parame‐\n    ter HOME.  If HOME is unset, the home directory of the user  executing  the\n    shell is substituted instead.  Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with\n    the home directory associated with the specified login name.\n\n    If the tilde-prefix is a `~+', the value of the shell variable PWD replaces\n    the  tilde-prefix.   If  the tilde-prefix is a `~-', the value of the shell\n    variable OLDPWD, if it is set, is substituted.  If the characters following\n    the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number N, optionally prefixed by\n    a `+' or a `-', the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element\n    from  the  directory  stack,  as  it would be displayed by the dirs builtin\n    invoked with the tilde-prefix as an argument.  If the characters  following\n    the  tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading `+' or\n    `-', `+' is assumed.\n\n    If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion  fails,  the  word  is\n    unchanged.\n\n    Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immediately\n    following a : or the first =.  In these cases, tilde expansion is also per‐\n    formed.   Consequently, one may use filenames with tildes in assignments to\n    PATH, MAILPATH, and CDPATH, and the shell assigns the expanded value.\n\n\nA: You are correct. the ~/Downloads is the same as /home/username/Downloads.\nSome installers and extractors are just very picky about where it needs to put things. I think it might be because it logs the filepaths, and the logs wont accept ~ in an accepted path.\nI just got used to typing in /home/username instead. :)\n", "Q: How do I install mdm on ubuntu 14.04?

The filesystem driver used to mount NTFS partitions in Ubuntu is 'ntfs-3g' which always expects the NTFS filesystem(s) to be in clean state. Whenever you hibernate Windows 7, by design, Windows always marks all the NTFS partition(s) as dirty. So, next time you boot Ubuntu with Windows 7 in hibernated state, it finds these NTFS partition(s) in dirty state and will complain. It is highly recommended NOT to do an fsck repairs on hibernated NTFS partition(s) in Ubuntu.

If you make your mount point something like /home/$user/server_mount then nautilus will hang when the server becomes unavailable.\n\n\nNote, this also affects other applications like Evolution. Receiving calendar events, or replying to a message would cause Evolution to 'dim' as it was waiting. I'm guessing it was requesting a full file listing for the attachment button, but I didn't investigate that further.\nMy quick solution for myself, was to just unmount the network shares I had connected to. For now, I'll only connect when I need to access the resources, then unmount when I'm done.\nYou're semi-permanently attached, so your solution will be a bit different, and its something I've done in the past.\n\n\n*\n\n*To handle reattaching after the server comes back up, you'll want to use an automounter - like autofs\n\n*To handle the nautilus hangs when the server isn't available, relocate the mount point somewhere that isn't a default starting point for nautilus, like a sub-directory. /home/$user/mounts/server_mount \n\n*You'll need to have your mount gracefully fail back to your application in a timely fashion when the sever goes away. To do that, you'll want to add the soft,retrans=1,retry=0,intr switches to your mount. If memory serves me correctly, the retrans,retry values only work with NFS over UDP, which is the default. If you're using it over TCP, then the timeout values will be based on the TCP stack settings.\n\n\nHTH\n", "Q: How to enable single click to open files?

Due to FAT32 constraint on Windows, I formatted my flash drive to NTFS. But after i installed Ubuntu into the flash drive and boots it, It keeps giving error running it. \nIm currently using YUMI to create all these bootable stuffs and had a 32GB USB3.0 to store these inside. Hope i can get a clear and dumb-proof solution. (Sorry if i'm asking too much)\n\nA: I do not think you can install Ubuntu to a NTFS flash drive.\nUsing FAT should allow it to work.\nUsing ext4 is recommended as it's linux native. The only downside is you can't access any files from the drive while in Windows.\nIf you have a big enough flash drive, try creating a small FAT32 partition for storing data and then creating an ext4 partition for storing Ubuntu.\n\nA: You would need to create an MBR on the drive, and then partition it in two pieces one being Fat32 or NTFS and the other being ext3/ext4. All that being said, YUMI would have to re-write all of the partition tables when it is writing the iso's. I think that this will get you going in the right direction: link\nWhen you install Ubuntu, it generally rewrites everything to ext3/ext4. NTFS is a Microsoft file system that Ubuntu would have overwritten. If you have Ubuntu installed, it can write to an NTFS partition if you have the package ntfs-3g installed. link\n", "Q: clang++ fails to compile simple hello world c++ program After upgrade to 14.04 from 12.04 clang++ stopped working.\n$ cat test.cpp \n#include <iostream>\n\nint main()\n{\n        std::cout << \"Hello World\" << std::endl;\n        return 0;\n}\n\n$ clang++ test.cpp \ntest.cpp:1:10: fatal error: 'iostream' file not found\n#include <iostream>\n         ^\n1 error generated\n\nInstalled with apt-get install clag-3.5 same happened with clang-3.4\nThanks\n\nA: I found to resolve this issue that after installing libstdc++-4.8-dev package, I need to specify the  include paths and lib path to the clang++ like this.\nclang++ -I/usr/include/c++/4.8/ -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/c++/4.8 -L /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8 test.cpp -o test\n\n\nA: Your code works for me.

Are there scenarios where vi is the only option to create, edit or modify a file in an Ubuntu environment?\nMy question is basically to really know if there is such a case where I would be forced to use vi because it would be the only option available in a particular case in the Ubuntu ecosystem. \nCould a particular case exist where I somehow would not have access to other options like nano, pico or simply sending the information with tools like cat, sed, tee and more?\nI would assume this is more of a server or cloud side since on the Desktop there are many more options, but from anybody that uses the terminal a lot I ask:\nIs there such a case?\n\nA: Fact of the matter is that, in many distributions editors like nano and pico just aren't standard while other packages, namely vim-tiny are. See here for the package list of ubuntu-minimal, vim-tiny is the only editor. According to this answer, it seems to be the case for Ubuntu server, as well. I know this is the case for base Debian, Fedora as well.\nThat being said, given that if you have nano on  your system I've yet to see a case where you'd HAVE to use vi instead, but, playing off @Volker's answer, if you're working for a customer and don't have root access? apt-get install nano isn't going to do you much good (if it even has access to the outside internet!).\n\nA: There are a number of cases where vi (and by that I naturally mean vim.tiny because that's what we ship) could be the only interactive editor. If we ignore butterflies and cosmic-rays, these seem like the most likely occasions where this could happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're only using the ubuntu-minimal base meta-package. This depends on vim-tiny  but no other editors. I can't currently find a way to install Ubuntu without the standard^ task but you can remove it after installation with:\nsudo apt-get remove $(apt-cache show standard^ | awk '/Package: / {print $2}')\n\nI have personal experience where I've been handed a system image without the standard^ task installed. If I hadn't had network access vi would have been my only option.\n\n*Chrooting into an environment that only mapped vi through\n\n*Manually nuking all the other editors (and disabling the means to reinstall them)\n\n*Manually breaking the shell to stop known editors except vi being launched.\nA true-minimal install will be the most likely reason but those are fairly rare these days. Some VPS and cloud hosting companies use them (to save disk space as much as anything else) but I would suggest that they are definitely not the norm.\n\nA: Inside the Ubuntu ecosystem, I do not think this case can even exist, as vi would at least be a vim-tiny, which is already a “real vim” far from “real vi.”\nIn the context of resource limited embedded systems,  which are not normally Ubuntu, you may just have a vi that turns out to be a link to busybox. And not space left.  Then, vi is the only option.\nApart from that, I think situations where vi the only option are not very common at all today, even outside the Linux world.\nBut there can easily be situations where vi is the only option you can plan for,\nthe only option that certaily will exist in some future situation — which will happen inside a customer’s over-chilled server room, most probably.\nImagine you are called by a customer:\n\nCustomer: I need to get this configuration fixed! Now!! I don’t know how, but I can tell you where the configuration file is. Can you help me!?!\nYou: Ok, what kind of system is that running on?\nCustomer: Oh, it's on server foo, ahh... it's running... can't remember, something with \"ix\" in the end, or mayeb with \"ux\"...\n\nNo problem, by now, you know there will be vi!\n\nA: In cases where you are not able to install emacs, or in cases where you need to modify a configuration file in order to enable you to install emacs.  :-p\n\nA: Many (most?) Busy-Box installations only have vi. \nIt's not ubuntu specific, but it is true of many embedded devices. \n\nA: There's always cat, head, tail ... so I am not sure there is system where you do not have any alternative, but it's possible to find systems where there is not a better alternative even if you prefer emacs.\nMy example was a system I once administered, that was either so slow (or the line was slow and lossy), that when navigating with cursor keys, it often suddenly switched to insert and injected garbage into the edited file, and using HJKL for movement was the only reliable option.\n\nA: Here's the case where vim is the only option within Ubuntu ecosystem: Ubuntu Snappy doesn't come with any text editor other than vim-tiny. Perhaps in future there will be one, but not as of 2015-16.  If you are going to be using Ubuntu Snappy over serial console or ssh, you better be prepared to use vim. \n\nA: Vi is never the only option; you can always use ed instead.\n\nA: Well, there is one case where you need the vi editor, lets assume:\n\n\n*\n\n*there is not graphical interface\n\n*you're on some strange unknown *nix system\n\n*your terminal look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*you have enough of guys like this:\n\n\n\nAs you can see there is no numerical keypad. With the old vi (and I mean the original traditional vi, not vim, vim.tiny, or vim.basic) you can edit a file with this keyboard. Without arrow keys? Yes, when you're in command mode you moved through the file with h, j, k and l, like a pro. h was left, j was down, k was up and l was right.\n\nA: I got myself into a situation once where only vi's linemode was working.

I meant to use this command: \n ln -s ../fun dir1/fun-sym\n\nIt was taken from a book I am using. Except I used sim at the end by mistake. So the last was /fun-sim. The command was accepted and it seemed to make 2 links. I also put in the correct command. Using \n ls -l \n\nit did show both as being links. They lines look the same except for the sim and sym. \n lrwxrwxrwx 1 julios julios    3 Aug 27 12:58 fun-sim -> fun \n\nand \n lrwxrwxrwx 1 julios julios    3 Aug 27 13:11 fun-sym -> fun. \n\nUsing this command \n ls -li \n\nit showed one number difference in the inode, 684226 & 684227. I am learning and lost but it caught my attention when it seemed to create a link. I thought there would have been an error message of some kind. No idea how to test it. I tried \n man sim \n\nand got this response: \n No manual entry for sim. \n\nThat seems to be the answer for no such command. I got the same response for go, jump and please. No problem was caused. What caught my attention was that it worked at all when it should have failed. Maybe one of the ways programming errors happen, typos. Anyway, it was interesting to me but I am just trying to find my way around the command line.\n\nA: No it isn't.\nAs you said, man sim doesn't exist.\nAnd running sim gives\nNo command 'sim' found, but there are 23 similar ones\n\nIn your example 'sim' was only used as part of a file name. 'fun-sym' could have been almost anything, it has no effect on the command. Since it is only the file you are creating, it only has to be a valid file name. \nAll that you did was instead of linking to ../fun dir1/fun-sym you linked to  ../fun dir1/fun-sim\nThis command still worked because when you are using ln to create symbolic links (i.e. -s option) the target does not have to exist, except for hard links Kudos @TheSchwa\n", "Q: How can I wipe my hard drive from the Debian command line to install Ubuntu to a blank hard drive? So here's my dilemma. I tried to install Debian and it wiped out Windows entirely after I installed the GRUB Bootloader. Thinking, \"ok, I'll just get it back after I finish installing Debian,\" I completed the installation and the final product turned out to be just a command line. I'm currently trying to install Gnome for the GUI, but in case that doesn't work for whatever reason, is there a way to uninstall the entire Debian OS from its own command line, and from here would I still be able to install Ubuntu? The only reason I'm concerned about deleting Debian is because when I popped in a Windows or Ubuntu ISO to the BIOS boot menu, it came up with an error containing the phrase, \"syslinux\" so clearly it knows that Linux is already installed. I believe it also said \"cannot find kernel image.\" Is there any workaround for this? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: If you're just looking to wipe the entire hard drive, you can just run:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=4M\n\nAssuming that sda is is the hard drive you want to wipe.\nThat being said, be careful! This will wipe THE ENTIRE HARD DRIVE, INCLUDING ANY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS YOU MAY HAVE INSTALLED. Since you overwrote your windows with debian anyway, you're probably hosed on that front, so this isn't so bad in your case.\nI'm also not sure how long it will take - it took <1s on a 4 GB flash drive for me, but for a large HDD it could take a while.\nThat being said, this is not the best way to go about this. What you really want to do is \njust pop in the live CD/USB and try again. The way to do this, from your current situation is:\nFor ubuntu 14.04 64-bit:\nwget http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.1/ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso\n\nPlug in a flash drive, type dmesg and see at what /dev/sdX it mounted it (I'll say /dev/sdc for the example)\nsudo dd if=ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdc\n\nThe magic thing about ubuntu ISOs is that you can write them directly to the metal of a flash drive and be able to boot into it.\nReboot your computer and choose the flash drive from the boot menu your BIOS gives you, continue installing ubuntu as normal.\n\nA: There really is no need to wipe the hard drive. Either keep running the installed OS or simply install another, choosing to wipe the drive during installation.\nThat said, as someone who has tried about a dozen distros, Ubuntu will be a lot easier to set up and use for a beginner.\n", "Q: what wifi adapter does linux need? Does anyone know what wireless adapter linux needs to work WiFi?  Cause linksys does not work. It brings up a CD and then when I click the cd and its just a bunch of files.

Everyone seems to want to create a transparent background. So I'm using Inkscape to create a logo, but to get it sized correctly, I'm opening it in GIMP. The image is showing as white, I've added a white background layer and everything, but when I go to upload it (it's an image for a header on my website) the background is still transparent. \nI've even tried just doing a screenshot of the image with the white background showing, but when I upload it to my site it's gray again. Sheesh, right?\nAny ideas for why this refuses to show up white? Also, if you know how to just size it properly in Inkscape, maybe that's easier.\n\nA: As Amanthety points out in the comments, first thing to do in Inkscape would be to go to File -> Document Properties and set the background color to white (by default it's transparent). To do this, click on the color bar next to \"Background color\" and set the A (alpha) value to 255. This makes the color opaque instead of transparent. Or, as Charles Green correctly comments, create a white object under your logo. Both solutions will have as a result a white background.\nConcerning sizes:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to File -> Document Properties and set the size there \n\n*and/or, if\nyou export the SVG to PNG (File -> Export PNG image) you can set the\nimage size of the PNG in pixels in the export dialog.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. Everyone wants to make the background transparent, but I wanted to make it white (!).\nI  tried with changing background colour in File -> Document Properties, but even removing transparency there, it would not show any background colour on saving (could somebody explain me why?).\nTherefore I recommend you to set a white rectangle as background:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select colour white and F4 to draw the rectangle with the size of your canvas\n\n*Send it to the back \"Lower to bottom\" (shortcut End)\n\n\nThis video will help you, it has a similar example.\nEnjoy it!\n", "Q: openstack: vms exchanging multicast on eth1 fail when one suffers IGMP timeout I have two identical trusty VMs configured with dhcp for eth1.

IP aliasing is very useful for setting up multiple virtual sites on Apache using one single network interface with different IP addresses on a single subnet network.\nThe main advantage of using this IP aliasing is, you don’t need to have a physical adapter attached to each IP, but instead you can create multiple or many virtual interfaces (aliases) to a single physical card.\nHere I have an interface called eth0, the default interface for the Ethernet device.

In fact, it is very well documented:\n  http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_reset_a_root_password\nThis is a basic part of the Linux operating system and is used in recovery scenarios only.

If you're worried about someone in your organization doing this, you need to lock your door.  (This is why server rooms are usually locked with a higher level of security than most places in the building.

I am using this script: http://www.thegameengine.org/miscellaneous/streaming-twitch-tv-ubuntu/ to stream to Twitch. It works but I don't want to stream my microphone, only the computer audio. How should I change the script to achieve that?\n\nA: Choosing computer audio\nPulseAudio\nThis can be done with PulseAudio and pavucontrol. From HOWTO: Proper Screencasting on Linux:\n\nInstall pavucontrol. Start recording with ffmpeg. Start\n  pavucontrol. Go to the “Recording” tab and you’ll find ffmpeg\n  listed there. Change audio capture from “Internal Audio Analog Stereo”\n  to “Monitor of Internal Audio Analog Stereo“. Now it should record\n  system and application audio instead of microphone.\nThis setting will be remembered. The next time you want to capture\n  with ffmpeg, it will automatically start recording system audio. If\n  you want to revert this, use pavucontrol again to change back to\n  microphone input.\n\nALSA\nAlternatively, ALSA can capture system audio if your audio system supports a loopback device often labeled: Stereo Mix, Wave out mix, Mono Mix, or What U Hear. Check in alsamixer to see if you have one of these, but hardware loopback is not as common these days. Then refer to FFmpeg Wiki: Capturing Audio with ALSA for the proper syntax if your system supports this feature.\nOtherwise I believe you can make a software loopback with ALSA, but I may be incorrect and have no experience with that.\n\nCrappy script\nThe ffmpeg command in that awful, re-occurring script has some issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*-preset should be used instead of -vpre\n\n*-qscale is ignored by libx264 (use -crf or -b:v)\n\n*The group of pictures is not set (use -g)\n\n*VBV should be used (use -maxrate and -bufsize)\n\n*The output may not use a compatible chroma subsampling scheme (use -pix_fmt yuv420p)\n\n*x11grab input should use -framerate, not -r\n\n*-threads 6 seems like an arbitrary number, and not everyone uses the same hardware. You should either use the default (by removing -threads, but it's \"greedy\"), or set an appropriate value that allows you to encode at a satisfactory rate and yet still allow enough juice to perform the other stuff that you're recording.\n\n\nThe command should be something like this instead:\nffmpeg \\\n-f alsa -ac 2 -i \"$INAUD\" \\\n-f x11grab -video_size \"$INRES\" -framerate \"$FPS\" -i :0.0 \\\n-vcodec libx264 -s \"$OUTRES\" -preset \"$QUAL\" -maxrate 1000k -bufsize 2000k -g 50 -pix_fmt yuv420p \\\n-acodec libmp3lame -ar 44100 -b:a 128k \\\n-f flv \"$STREAM_URL\"\n\nNote: Do not just blindly use my example values for -maxrate, -bufsize, -g, and -b:a.

The zip command updates instead of creates a new compressed file if the file it attempts to create already exist, even if you don't indicate the -u option. \n\nA: You need to quote the exclude pattern, as you already tried to do; The first one should actually work, even if there is a \"nicer\" solution.\nBut let's look at a simplified example to work with; I Created some directories with files with .foo and .bar extensions:\nHere I run find to list my test directory - it shows all files and directories:\n$ find\n.\n./1.bar\n./1.foo\n./sub1\n./sub1/sub2\n./sub1/sub2/1.bar\n./sub1/sub2/1.foo\n./sub1/1.foo\n./sub1/1.bar\n\nNow, we can just see what works\n(we get the output file out of the way, its not relevant to the matching).\nPacking all files:\n$ zip -r /tmp/out.zip *          \n  adding: 1.bar (stored 0%)\n  adding: 1.foo (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/ (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/sub2/ (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/sub2/1.bar (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/sub2/1.foo (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/1.foo (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/1.bar (stored 0%)\n\nPacking excluding .foo files:\n$ rm /tmp/out.zip\n$ zip -r /tmp/out.zip * -x '*.foo'\n  adding: 1.bar (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/ (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/sub2/ (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/sub2/1.bar (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/1.bar (stored 0%)\n\nWorks!\nTrying again with your first pattern:\n$ rm /tmp/out.zip\n$ zip -r /tmp/out.zip * -x \\*.foo \n  adding: 1.bar (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/ (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/sub2/ (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/sub2/1.bar (stored 0%)\n  adding: sub1/1.bar (stored 0%)\n\nWorks too!\nSo... take a close look at what you really did run there.\nFirst you could remove the -q option for \"quiet\", hiding the standard messages shown in my examples.\nAs a next step, add the -v option for \"verbose\", to see more details - maybe too many, but maybe you can spot something interesting.\n\nFrom the comments I see that removing the -q already helped; \nThe underlying problem was that the zip command used for testing was modified by the existence of the output file.\nTechnically, it had modified itself even...\nFrom man zip: \nCommand format.  The basic command format is\n\n               zip options archive inpath inpath ...\n\n        where archive is a new or existing zip archive and inpath is a directory or\n        file path optionally including wildcards.  When given the name of an exist‐\n        ing zip archive, zip will replace identically named entries in the zip  ar‐\n        chive (matching the relative names as stored in the archive) or add entries\n        for new names.\n\n", "Q: Using skype 4.3 in ubuntu 14.04 I am trying to install and use Skype 4.3 in ubuntu 14.04 (I upgraded both recently).

Out of the box, it does not work correctly with Ubuntu, which detects a corrupted EDID over the DVI cable, and refuses to output the correct 1440p resolution. Because this monitor does not come with a built-in scaler, this results in the monitor ignoring Ubuntu's output altogether - instead showing a multi-color test pattern. I fixed this by placing the following in my xorg.conf:\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"CustomEDID\" \"DFP-0:/etc/X11/edid-shimian.bin\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nAnd then of course, at the given path, I've placed a file called edid-shimian.bin, containing an EDID that allows the monitor to display 1440p.\nThe experience of using this monitor is so glorious (you really need to try it out) that I've decided to buy two more to use with this machine, driven by a Nvidia GTX 760. However, the monitor requires a dual-link DVI connection, and that card only offers two, so the third monitor is instead the DP2710 MULTI variant, which allows the use of an HDMI connection.\nThey've both arrived today and my work-around doesn't seem to work for them. The main monitor still works, but the second DVI monitor does the test pattern, and the HDMI monitor is capped at 1080p. (I dual boot with Windows and was able to get all three monitors to show 1440p there.)\nMy plan is to somehow apply the same xorg.conf option to the other two monitors, but I'm not sure of how to manipulate xorg.conf to make that happen. Suggestions?\n\nA: Figured it out. So there are two problems that need to be solved to make this work.:\n1) The second DVI-Dual-Link monitor needs the EDID file because the monitor has a corrupt EDID. (The EDID file I was using, as you can tell by the file-name, was originally sourced from a Shimian branded monitor, and I don't know how it was done, but I know that it works. If you are reading this, and need the file, let me know and I can upload it.)\n2) The HDMI monitor has a valid EDID, but it's one that for some reason lists its max resolution as 1080p. \nThese problems are solved with the following entry in xorg.conf:\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n\n    Option         \"ModeValidation\" \"AllowNon60hzmodesDFPModes, NoEDIDDFPMaxSizeCheck, NoVertRefreshCheck, NoHorizSyncCheck, NoDFPNativeResolutionCheck, NoMaxSizeCheck, NoMaxPClkCheck, AllowNonEdidModes, NoEdidMaxPClkCheck\"\n\n    Option         \"CustomEDID\" \"DFP-0: /etc/X11/edid-shimian.bin; DFP-3: /etc/X11/edid-shimian.bin\"\n\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DFP-0: 2560x1440 +2560 +0, DFP-1: 2560x1440 +0+0, DFP-3: 2560x1440 \n\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nThe whitespace between the Option lines is for clarity, and not necessary. Here's what each does:\nThe metamodes line specifies a screen resolution for each monitor. In this case, DFP-0 was the first DVI monitor, DFP-3 is the second, and DFP-1 is on HDMI. This metamodes line sets them all to 1440p and places the HDMI monitor on the left, with the second DVI monitor on the right. This line will not be enough on its own - the other two lines are necessary.\nThe CustomEDID line points the DVI monitors to the aforementioned binary EDID file. This line's presence convinces the Nvidia driver that they are capable of 1440p.\nThe ModeValidation line essentially disables a ton of safety mechanisms aimed at preventing you from putting the wrong resolution on screen. As such it's important to use caution when using these options! In this case though, I know for sure the monitors are all capable of the resolution I am demanding. This line is necessary for the HDMI monitor to work.\nHopefully this helps some other folks out!\n\nA: I bought 2 of the following monitors from ebay for $659.80 each on Fri, Jul 27, 2012, at 9:47 AM EST:\nACHIEVA Shimian QH270-Lite Quad HD 2560x1440 DVI\nI set them up on Ubuntu using the EDID file I found on some online post using the CustomEDID option as described above.

I am developing a multiplatform program using Mono and it requires Form Opacity support. Basically the ability to make a window semi-transparent. This works fine in windows by setting the Window.Form.Opacity property to say 0.5. In Ubuntu 14.04 however it does not work out-of-the-box. I think I'm running Unity and Compiz, whatever came with the default Ubuntu setup. \nAccording to the Mono FAQ, this should be supported:\n\nHow can I make my windows alpha blended? (transparent)\nMono’s Winform implementation supports transparency on its windows as\n  long as the underlying windowing system has support for it.\nFor Unix/X11 users this means that they must have the COMPOSITE\n  extension enabled on their server, and they must be running a\n  compositing manager, like xcompmgr.\nThe GenToo Linux Wiki has a good description on how to setup the Xorg\n  server for transparency support.\n\nhttp://www.mono-project.com/docs/faq/winforms/\nThe link they point to is dead.\nI'm new to Linux and not quite sure I understand all the parts involved in getting a compositing window manager up and running. Besides, don't I already have one (compiz?)\nWhat should I try to get my Winform opacity to work?\nEdit: My test program is basically a form with a scrollbar (goes from 0 to 100) that has an event handler on change to set the form's opacity based on the scrollbar's value. This is the meat of it:\nprivate void trackBar1_Scroll(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    double opacity = ((double)trackBar1.Value) / 100;\n    this.Opacity = opacity;\n}\n\nWorks great in Windows.\n\nA: You do indeed have all you need with compiz.\nSetting Window.Form.Opacity should set the X window property _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY on the window;  \nFor a test whether the ubuntu part works, try setting the opacity manually to 0.5 with this low-level command (click the window):\n$ xprop -f _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY 32c -set _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY 0x7fffffff\n\nAnd back to full opacity:\n$ xprop -f _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY 32c -set _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY 0xffffffff\n\n\nOne way how setting Window.Form.Opacity could fail is that it chooses a wrong (but closely related) window, and set's the property there.\n\nAccording to your comments, the idea was right. Adding:\nI suspect it is a very specific error that exists in other software too: The window that is choosen to make it transparent is found by some heuristics based on how the X windows of the window decorator and the application are related/nested etc. But with the introduction of reparenting WM's there was a lot of change in the area - gladly the heuristics still worked. From what I understand, this is a case of the heuristics failing,so that some nearby invisible window will be made transparent...  \nLook at this bug to understand more of the problem: transset fails to change the _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY property\n", "Q: apache2 wont start I had my server up and running fine until my laptop got unplugged and died while i was away. now when i try to restart apache2 using `sudo apache2 -k restart' i get this error:\n[Wed Aug 27 20:16:27.504121 2014] [core:warn] [pid 6953] AH00111: Config variable\n${APACHE_LOCK_DIR} is not defined\n[Wed Aug 27 20:16:27.504212 2014] [core:warn] [pid 6953] AH00111: Config variable\n${APACHE_PID_FILE} is not defined\n[Wed Aug 27 20:16:27.504240 2014] [core:warn] [pid 6953] AH00111: Config variable\n${APACHE_RUN_USER} is not defined\n[Wed Aug 27 20:16:27.504255 2014] [core:warn] [pid 6953] AH00111: Config variable\n${APACHE_RUN_GROUP} is not defined\n[Wed Aug 27 20:16:27.504277 2014] [core:warn] [pid 6953] AH00111: Config variable\n${APACHE_LOG_DIR} is not defined\n[Wed Aug 27 20:16:27.507253 2014] [core:warn] [pid 6953:tid 3074841216] AH00111:\nConfig variable ${APACHE_LOG_DIR} is not defined\n[Wed Aug 27 20:16:27.507466 2014] [core:warn] [pid 6953:tid 3074841216] AH00111:\nConfig variable ${APACHE_LOG_DIR} is not defined\n[Wed Aug 27 20:16:27.507491 2014] [core:warn] [pid 6953:tid 3074841216] AH00111:\nConfig variable ${APACHE_LOG_DIR} is not defined\nAH00526: Syntax error on line 74 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf:\nInvalid Mutex directory in argument file:${APACHE_LOCK_DIR}\n\nI didnt change anything to cause all this as it worked fine with no errors until i noticed one day that my server wasnt live.

What are meaning of these  ?\n\n\nA: Roughly speaking these all are basically different directories of your system.\nEach directory is created for different purposes. For example\n/boot - To store boot related files, grub config files etc\n\n/home - user home directory all users data is stored under this directory\n\nand so on..you can get the complete list from google.\nThe root directory i.e. / directory is the parent of all these directories.The / directory contains all these directories.\nWhile installing if you select / as a mount point then a single partition is created for / directory and hence all these directories will be created in that partition but sometimes it is preferred to create separate partitions for some directories like /boot, /home etc. because it helps while reinstalling or updating the system.\nHence if you want to create the separate partition for /boot you just create 3 patitions(1 swap, 1 for / and 1 for /boot) and for 3rd partition you select /boot as the mount point.\nI hope this clears your doubts!\n", "Q: How do I make Ubuntu 14.04 recognize my Galaxy S4 as a Microphone via 3.5mm jack/USB? Long story short, I'm trying to get some screen recording done and my puppy chewed my microphone rendering it useless.\nI've managed to get the Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 connected as a microphone through both USB and 3.5mm jack on Windows OS however, I am trying to eliminate MS Windows from my PC and I want to get everything I need to be done with Ubuntu.\nI've downloaded an app on the phone \"Mic to Speaker\" and I've connected the phone to the pc via a 3.5mm jack however in the sound app at input, nothing's moving except the \"built in\" mic which only hears Ubuntu, meaning the clicks, the beeps.\nDoes anyone know how I can get my Galaxy S4 to become a microphone for my Ubuntu OS?\n\nA: *\n\n*Select correct  input jack in \"input device\" tab from \"Pulseaudio volume control\"\n\n*Type this command in terminal (vlc and vlc-plugin-pulse must be installed ):\nvlc pulse://\nVlc will capture pulseaudio recorded signal  and play it to the default pulse output (speaker or headphone).\n", "Q: Hide from other users the folders they do not have read and execute permissions For the sake of this question, assume there is User1 and User2, besides the root user of course.\nI want to share (rx) with User2 an specific folder within User1 home (say, /home/User1/Music/Aerosmith/). I can use chmod for the respective permissions and all is fine: User2 can explore and play the content of that folder. Now, as User2 moves into the shared folder, she can actually see all the other subfolders present at each stage (e.g. it can see that there is a folder called /home/User1/Music/Madonna) even though she cannot access them. Now, what I want is for User2 to only see the folders she is allowed to read and execute, hiding all the other things I'm not sharing with her. Folders need to be invisible either from a GUI perspective (say, in Thunar) or using ls.\nI can't find a solution for this. Is it just impossible from the command line perspective?\n\nA: Remove the read permission for others (or group, if user2 is part of user1's primary group) from the directories in the tree:\nchmod o-r /home/User1 -R\nchmod o+r /home/User1/Music/Aerosmith/Rocks -R\n\nAs long as the execute permissions remain, User2 will be able to traverse the directory tree, but not see the contents.\n", "Q: how to enable hyperZ on radeon hd 5000 series?

Today I installed 14.04 alongside Windows Vista since it's a shared computer and my brother is stubborn. After giving Ubuntu a once over I decided I loved it but soon noticed that I'm missing a hardrive, I have 120Gb Main boot which has Vista installed, A 20Gb and two other 80gb which I have stiped together for media and my Steam Library. So C: as boot, D: as spare where I have Ubuntu installed, and then I: as the striped media drive. (I:) is missing, all it will show me is C: and D:.\nDoes anyone know how I can fix this or have some troubleshooting I can do?\n\nA: Most likely Windows is assigning D: to what you earlier know as I:, as Windows cannot work with Unix-Filesystems. You can change the assignment on your System-configuration of windows. But this is something for Superuser ;) \n", "Q: What swapfile size to make? I have 4GB RAM Very often I am out of memory. I noticed that I don't have a swapfile. What size should I choose? I have 4GB RAM.\nPrograms I use are: Firefox, Thunderbird, Grive, Android Studio, that's it, still my laptop freezes pretty often.\n\nA: Here's a fairly sensible guide from The Linux Questions Wiki\n\nAlmost every Linux system will need swap space. The classic piece of advice is \"swap should be double the amount of RAM you have\", though this is not a rigid guideline. Another guideline is to have at least 1x your RAM size, but this also isn't a fixed, absolute requirement (this used to be necessary for linux, but not anymore for recent versions). It depends mainly on what applications you want to run. Applications like video/movie editing, 3d rendering, large image editing, database servers and web application servers can use a lot of memory and if you don't have that as RAM, it will need a large swap space.\nA good way to decide the size, is to just try and see. Pick a size (it is usually easier to reduce the swap size after-wards, so aim high) and run your 'normal' workload for a while and see how much swap is used (See Memory diagnostic tools). You can then adjust/resize the partitions or re-partition completely.\nTo optimize for speed, it is advisable to put the swap partition on a different hard disk (if you have one) instead of on the main hard disk with the OS on it. It is also possible to spread the swap space over multiple hard disks, this can also increase the speed. Linux can handle multiple swap spaces, and each swap space can have a priority (pri=somenumber in fstab, also see swapon command). \n\nI'm building a file server with 4G of RAM at the moment, and have started off with 8G swap space as I'm going to use a fair bit of RAM by using a union mount. It can always be adjusted later.\n\nA: Swap of 500 MB to 1 GB should be fine. I made swap of 500 MB at the time of installation and have not faced any problem so far. I have 2 GB RAM.\n", "Q: Create folders under \"Places\" I'd like to add folders to the nautilus \"Places\" menu with custom vector icons. There are a few solutions out there but they all address Ubuntu 13.10 and aren't easily ported to 14.04.\nIdeally I want to be able to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete \"Recent\"(under Places)\n\n*Set custom icons for the folders\n\n\nPlease don't suggest adding a Bookmark.\n\nA: I don't know if it still applies to unity, but once in a while one would make a ~/.gtk-bookmarks file with something like the below to get a custom list of places:\nfile:///home/boris/bks bks\nfile:///home/boris/box box\nfile:///home/boris/dwn dwn\nfile:///home/boris/cmp cmp\nfile:///home/boris/pcs pcs\nfile:///home/boris/msc msc\nfile:///home/boris/pst pst\nfile:///home/boris/scl scl\nfile:///home/boris/trn trn\nfile:///home/boris/vds vds\nfile:///home/boris/wrk wrk\n\nHere the first column are places, and the second one are how you want them appear in nautilus.\nEdit:\nHere it said that the ~/.gtk-bookmarks is replaced with ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks (but the syntax is the same). And here it is said that the list is found at ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs and one also had to add enabled=false in ~/.config/user-dirs.conf.\n\nA: The answer by Adobe works for me on Ubuntu 14.04, but it is only for bookmarks\nVery simply\nOpen a terminal and type\ngedit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmark\n\nYou will have a file listing like that in Adobe's answer. \nAdd a line to the file to show what you want.\n\nA: As of a long time, the Places list and Recents is hardcoded into Nautilus. There is nothing you can do about it at all.\nYou could theoretically modify the source code, but that is very problematic. You could theoretically use another file manager (Nemo seems good), but that seems to be your only choice if you do not want to modify source code. Or, you could just use Bookmarks like the rest of us.\nIf you want to try using the source code, tell me. I will post instructions here for your ease.\n\nA: I don't enjoy saying this, but customizing Nautilus is not high on the list of priorities of GNOME devs at the moment. If you're unwilling to modify the source code of Nautilus, I very strongly recommend that you consider installing Nemo. Nemo is everything that Nautilus was, and more.\nInstalling Nemo is easy: search in the Software Centre (where it's called files) or -\nsudo apt-get install nemo\n\nIn Nemo, there's only a single combined list for Places and Bookmarks:\n\nTherefore, adding an entry to the Places menu is exactly the same as adding an entry to the Bookmarks. Adobe's answer covers the configuration file, but any other method (CtrlD, dragging-and-dropping, etc.) works just as well.\nFor example, here's my file:\n$ cat .config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks\nfile:///home/muru/Downloads Downloads\nfile:///home/muru/Documents\nfile:///home/muru/Music\nfile:///home/muru/Pictures\nfile:///home/muru/Videos\nfile:///home/muru/Templates\nsftp://laptop/home/muru laptop\nsftp://mars/muru mars\n\nThere's a distinction in the dialog box shown for opening files in most applications:\n\nI think the entries for the home folder, Desktop folder and filesystems are hardcoded. They can't be removed, at any rate (the option is disabled for them, but enabled for the others).\nNemo uses the same icon for a folder in both the sidebar and the main view. It's called an emblem (the icon next to the name):\n\nYou can set any image here:\n\nIn this case, the icon for the Templates folder is a 1.4MB wallpaper.\n", "Q: WiFi interface doesn't come up All of sudden, my builtin Wifi interface on the laptop (HP Pavilion dv7, running Ubuntu 12.04, kernel 3.2.0-64-generic)  won't come up.  \n# ifconfig wlan0\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 40:25:c2:d9:fb:8c  \n      UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n      RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n      RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n# iwconfig wlan0\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:off/any  \n      Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=0 dBm   \n      Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n      Encryption key:off\n      Power Management:off\n\n\"dmesg\" command shows\nADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready\n\nHere are some of the kernel modules\n# lsmod | grep iw\niwlwifi               381794  0 \nmac80211              543880  1 iwlwifi\ncfg80211              210370  2 iwlwifi,mac80211\ncompat                 13447  7 iwlwifi,mac80211,cfg80211,bnep,rfcomm,bluetooth,usbnet\n\nI have the \"network-manager\" running, the icon is in the system tray, but it doesn't show  any wireless network even though it's only a few feet away from the WiFi router (my cell phone can talk to the WiFi router fine).\ncommand \"iwlist wlan0 scan\" show a list ESSIDs (including my WiFi router). \nI have tried the following but it didn't help.\n    sudo ifdown wlan0\n    sudo ifup wlan0\nRebooting the laptop didn't help either.\nAny help will be greatly appreciated!\nPart of dmesg \n[ 5534.540251] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: PCI INT A disabled\n[ 5544.897099] cfg80211: Calling CRDA to update world regulatory domain\n[ 5544.907411] cfg80211: World regulatory domain updated:\n[ 5544.907414] cfg80211:   (start_freq - end_freq @ bandwidth), (max_antenna_gain, max_eirp)\n[ 5544.907416] cfg80211:   (2402000 KHz - 2472000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\n[ 5544.907418] cfg80211:   (2457000 KHz - 2482000 KHz @ 20000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\n[ 5544.907419] cfg80211:   (2474000 KHz - 2494000 KHz @ 20000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\n[ 5544.907421] cfg80211:   (5170000 KHz - 5250000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\n[ 5544.907423] cfg80211:   (5735000 KHz - 5835000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\n[ 5544.910517] iwlwifi: Intel(R) Wireless WiFi Link AGN driver for Linux, in-tree:\n[ 5544.910519] iwlwifi: Copyright(c) 2003-2012 Intel Corporation\n[ 5544.910605] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: PCI INT A -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 17\n[ 5544.910651] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: setting latency timer to 64\n[ 5544.910692] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: pci_resource_len = 0x00002000\n[ 5544.910694] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: pci_resource_base = ffffc90012614000\n[ 5544.910695] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: HW Revision ID = 0x67\n[ 5544.910856] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: irq 53 for MSI/MSI-X\n[ 5544.915028] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: loaded firmware version 41.28.5.1 build 33926\n[ 5544.915490] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: CONFIG_IWLWIFI_DEBUG disabled\n[ 5544.915500] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: CONFIG_IWLWIFI_DEBUGFS enabled\n[ 5544.915508] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: CONFIG_IWLWIFI_DEVICE_TRACING enabled\n[ 5544.915515] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: CONFIG_IWLWIFI_DEVICE_TESTMODE disabled\n[ 5544.915523] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: CONFIG_IWLWIFI_P2P enabled\n[ 5544.915531] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: Detected Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N + WiMAX 6150 BGN, REV=0x84\n[ 5544.915733] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: L1 Enabled; Disabling L0S\n[ 5544.926407] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: device EEPROM VER=0x557, CALIB=0x6\n[ 5544.926411] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: Device SKU: 0x150\n[ 5544.926414] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: Valid Tx ant: 0x1, Valid Rx ant: 0x3\n[ 5544.926433] iwlwifi 0000:07:00.0: Tunable channels: 13 802.11bg, 0 802.11a channels\n[ 5544.926586] Registered led device: phy0-led\n[ 5544.926621] cfg80211: Ignoring regulatory request Set by core since the driver uses its own custom regulatory domain\n[ 5544.926785] ieee80211 phy0: Selected rate control algorithm 'iwl-agn-rs'\n\n\nA: Try editing /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\n        wireless-essid [ESSID]\n        wpa-psk password `\nIf it's a problem with your network manager this should help. \nMore info: https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse\n", "Q: Nexus 4 ubuntu touch - No internet connection while cellurar data only enabled I have loaded ubuntu touch on my Nexus 4 and I don't seem to get the Internet to work while cellular data is enabled only.

I'm looking to pick up some programming skills and after looking into it a bit, I came across an article that recommended that I learn Python as a way of getting started at programming before moving on to other languages. I realize Python 2.x.x is preinstalled in Ubuntu, but I was wondering if it's possible to upgrade to Python 3.x.x as the site's documentation seems to indicate that 3.x.x is where the language is going in the future.\nFailing that, how do I update Python 2.7.6 to 2.7.8?\n\nA: pyenv seems the way to go if you want to play with more than just the distribution's supplied version of Python 2.x and the supplied version of Python 3.x.\nIt let's you install many different Python versions side-by-side and choose between them.  The installation happens inside a hidden directory in your home directory so you do not have to be root, you cannot disturb other people using other accounts (if there are any on your machine) and the \"main\" installation is always safe and secure and will not be changed or overridden in any way.\nhttps://github.com/yyuu/pyenv#installation\n\nA: According to the package listing, Ubuntu 14.04 comes with Python 3.4 installed by default. Run python3 if you want python3.x.x (or python3.4 if you want python3.4.x).\nUntil most components have been migrated to Python 3, both 2.7.x and 3.x will be available on Ubuntu, with python being python2. \nPython 2.7.8 isn't available in the official repositories. However, there's a PPA available: Old and New Python versions. See What are PPAs and how do I use them? to understand how to use PPAs. Also note that while the version in Ubuntu 14.04 may remain 3.4.0 for sometime, the devs will be backporting fixes from 3.4.1.\n\nA: Besides pyenv (as Peter Lund suggests), or a PPA (as muru suggests), or building from source and installing into /usr/local, if you decide you need another version of Python 3, you can use Conda (which is now suggested by the maintainer of that PPA).\nLike pyenv, Conda facilitates creating and managing multiple separate Python installations on the same system. You'll likely want to choose Anaconda over Miniconda if you haven't used Conda before. (If you have used Conda before, then you may still often choose Anaconda; the choice is then a technical one made mainly based on the nature of your specific task.)\nThe Anaconda installer is available here. For more information on Anaconda, I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"Linux install\" section of Anaconda Install in the official documentation.\n\n*How to install Anaconda on Ubuntu?\n", "Q: Php.ini file change not reflecting in phpinfo() My php.ini settings are not reflected in phpinfo. It still shows upload_max_filesize as 2M but I have set it to 50M in php.ini. Can you please tell how to change php.ini properly? I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and I made changes to file in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini as described in Find the correct php.ini file and also restarted apache server and even restarted my laptop. Is this the right php.ini file I'm making changes to? What could be the possible reasons?\n\nA: Some time it happens that in php.ini, there is some syntax error on some line number for example\nerror_reporting = E_ALL && ~E_DEPRECATED && ~E_STRICT\n\nIn this case the apache does not load configuration after that line number. So this is bit complex to figure out syntax error in php.ini therefore you should try other ways to fix and you should try this solution at the end.\n\nA: You should modify post_max_size too.\nAccording to php manual:\n post_max_size integer\n    Sets max size of post data allowed. This setting also affects file upload. \n    To upload large files, this value must be larger than upload_max_filesize. \n    If memory limit is enabled by your configure script, memory_limit also affects\n    file uploading. Generally speaking, memory_limit should be larger than\n    post_max_size. \n\n", "Q: How do I get Banshee to work with my Android 4.4.2 device? I have a new Galaxy S5 (SC-04), with Android 4.4.2.

It takes a long time, 5 to 10 minutes for the Android to appear in the Banshee interface. When it does, it does not recognize any of the existing music folders or files.

So, I can get about 300 to 500 songs transferred, but no more.\n\nA: Try what I did. Open preferences in Banshee and disable the Apple Products in the plugins section. As soon as I did that my GS4 showed up and I could sync to it. I'm not sure if it helped but as mentioned in another (much older) thread I created a file .is_audio_player on the root directory of my external sd card and the phone memory. I just used the free ES File Explorer app to do that. I'm also using openSUSE 13.1 but I was having the same problem as you.\nI made a playlist named \"Android\" and set Banshee to sync that to my phone. Now the phone only has what I put on that playlist.\n", "Q: Error on installing upstream kernel I tried to install latest upstream kernel(linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2-generic_3.17.0-031700rc2.201408251935_amd64.deb) from here but installation failed with this error:\nuser@user-pc:~$ sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2-generic_3.17.0-031700rc2.201408251935_amd64.deb\n(Reading database ... 228154 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2-generic_3.17.0-031700rc2.201408251935_amd64.deb ...\nUnpacking linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2-generic (3.17.0-031700rc2.201408251935) over (3.17.0-031700rc2.201408251935) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2-generic:\n linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2-generic depends on linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2; however:\n  Package linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2 is not installed.\n\ndpkg: error processing package linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2-generic (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2-generic\n\nI tried to install with using GDebi and I get this error:\nuser@user-pc:~$ sudo gdebi linux-headers-3.17.0-031700rc2-generic_3.17.0-031700rc2.201408251935_amd64.deb\nReading package lists...

This solution can work on Linux or windows.  We are recommending them to use Ubuntu to save cost and great performance.  But they are worried about hidden licensing cost/impact if any. (We have given them ample examples that Ubuntu is free to use. But one competing agency which is Microsoft shop scaring them, and  I am die hard open source fan and don't want them to win.)\nIs there Terms and Condition white paper for ubuntu, mySQL available which helps us to prove that Ubuntu/Linux is free to use in commercial environment also? (I know Amazon is the best example, but still it did not help!).\nRegards,\nVR\n\nA: This question is not necessarily about Ubuntu. Instead, it is about ALL open source software.\nFrom the official Open Source website:\n\nAbsolutely. All Open Source software can be used for commercial purpose; the Open Source Definition guarantees this. You can even sell Open Source software.\nHowever, note that commercial is not the same as proprietary. If you receive software under an Open Source license, you can always use that software for commercial purposes, but that doesn't always mean you can place further restrictions on people who receive the software from you. In particular, so-called copyleft-style Open Source licenses require that when you distribute the software, you do so under the same license you received it under.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nUbuntu (well Linux) is free software. It can be used and redistributed for NO COST, regardless of what or where you are.\nIf you really wanted to, forward them a copy of the GPL.\n", "Q: static ip in NetworkManager but ifconfig does not show the ip (ubuntustudio 14.04) i am running ubuntustudio 14.04.\nI have a development setup where my pc has 2 NICs one of which connects to the internet and acquires dhcp ip from the router, while the other (eth1) is used to connect development boards etc. Now, on eth1 I have a dhcp server running for that \"development intranet\" and I want to have a static ip address on this interface. \nThe problem is that dhcp server fails to start executing and the reason is that eth1 does not have the ip that I have set through the NetworkManager.

I've been browsing the Internet for quite a while on the search for an alternative to Skype.\nSince I'm looking for a cross-platform program, I chose Jitsi for a start but found that it works quite unreliable (e.g. shuts down when receiving a call) and lacks some technical sophistication as well (e.g. produces echos, stops transmission for seconds during a call). Thus it's not what I'm looking for.\nIs there some program you can recommend (Linux - Linux/Linux - Windows)?\nI'd really like to avoid using Skype as a last resort.\n\nA: Both Teamspeak and Mumble are in my opinion better than Skype. They use less resources than Skype but require a server to run. \nSo either you set up a server yourself or you find an open server. \nTeamspeak and Mumble are basically the same, both require a server to run and both have better sound quality than Skype. They are both available for different platforms although Mumble has better support for Linux. \nThey have different security options. You can put a server password so that only some users may get onto the server, or you can set different user levels so only some users may enter specific rooms. Both models are good, but I prefer the user levels since this allows everyone to access and use some rooms and also gives specific users more private rooms. \nBoth Teamspeak and Mumble are popular in Clan games, since it's easy to connect to a server and find people to talk to. \nMore information about both programs can be found below,\n\n\n*\n\n*Teamspeak\n\n*Mumble\n\nA: I use google hangouts, it runs in browser.\nYou do have to install a program, but it is cross platform.

You can add username=user to the -o list (where user is the username on target machine):\nsudo mount -t cifs //192.168.0.2/uniserv /tmp/uniserv/ -o username=user,sec=lanman,servern=Uniplus1\nIf you want to connect to the share as a guest, use guest instead of username=user in the -o list:\nsudo mount -t cifs //192.168.0.2/uniserv /tmp/uniserv/ -o guest,sec=lanman,servern=Uniplus1\n\nIf the server gives information about ownership and permissions, mount.cifs will try to respect it. Otherwise, all files and directories in the share will be owned by root, and accessible only by root. If you don't want that, you can add use the uid and or gid arguments to specify user or group IDs. A common way is uid=$UID. For example:\nsudo mount -t cifs //192.168.0.2/uniserv /tmp/uniserv/ -o guest,uid=$UID,sec=lanman,servern=Uniplus1\n\nThe UID environment variable is a bashism (also in zsh), so if you're invoking this command from a shell that doesn't support it (such as dash, which provides sh in Ubuntu), use $(id -ru) instead (or manually put in your actual user ID number from /etc/passwd):\nsudo mount -t cifs //192.168.0.2/uniserv /tmp/uniserv/ -o guest,uid=$(id -ru),sec=lanman,servern=Uniplus1\n\nSource: Mainly man mount.cifs.\nIf you'd prefer to perform the mount operation itself as a regular (non-root) user, How do I mount Samba share as non-root user may help.\n\nA: I solved an issue how to connect old Windows 98 to Ubuntu/Debian using mount.cifs (in my case my system is Raspbian), working command is:\nsudo mount -t cifs -o user=guest,pass=,vers=1.0,sec=none,domain=MOSSBAUERLAB,ip=192.168.10.217,servern=MICHAEL //MICHAEL/AUTOSAVES /mnt/sm2201/dev\n\nWhere:\n\n*\n\n*MICHAEL is my computer name\n\n*AUTOSAVES name of shared folder\n\n*MOSSBAERLAB is a Workgroup name\n\nThere are one significant thing that should be Noted, all names (Computer, Workgroup, Share) must be in uppercase.\n", "Q: I updated to ubuntu 14.04 but now it does not show any files in home and also terminal I updated to ubuntu version 14.04  first it was showing blank screen but after running some codes now it opens but does not show any files in home folder\nit does not even fetch terminal\n\nA: Okay, this is a list that may fix it:\nFisrt try\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nthen if that doesn't work\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nIf it is still broken\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nWe really need more details you help you solve this.\n", "Q: How to wake xubuntu desktop from sleep I am using xubuntu 14.04 and it is connected to  a TV via VGA. \nWhen I leave the computer for a while the screen goes blank(i'm assuming it's gone to sleep) my problem is that when I move the mouse or press a letter on the keyboard the display just won't wake up??(It could be the TV??)\nAny help greatly appreciated\n\nA: Here are a few options to avoid or recover from the issue.\nTemporary fix\nIn the main bug ticket there's now a fix which involves adding a PPA:\nAdd the Xubuntu Developers PPA to get the new packages: \n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xubuntu-dev/ppa\n\nUpdate package information and update the two crucial packages:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xfce4-power-manager light-locker-settings\n\nxfce4-power-manager-data will get upgraded at the same time\nRestart your machine.\nTo remove the upgrades and return your machine to it's state prior to testing\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:xubuntu-dev/ppa\n\nTemporary workaround\nThe easiest way to work around this bug is to disable lock on suspend in the light locker settings.

In fact, this is touchpad support. Currently, i'am testing if update to 14.10 fixes problem with this module to get touchpad to work also ( i didn't noticed that it was not working earlier) \nIt appears that kernel module psmouse providing touchpad  support was interfering with mouse for unidentified reason. \nUnload module to restore normal mouse behavior:\ngniewomir@gniewomir-ThinkPad-T420:~$ sudo modprobe -r psmouse\n\nPrevent module from loading:\ngniewomir@gniewomir-ThinkPad-T420:~$ sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAdd line:\nblacklist psmouse\n\nThen:\ngniewomir@gniewomir-ThinkPad-T420:~$ sudo update-initramfs -u\n\nReboot and we are done. \n\nA: So.

Of course, if I do it as root -- that is to say, sudo convert -- the operation goes through without a hitch. So my question, since I know some of you might probably say I'm an idiot for not thinking about doing the sudo act, is: Why is the convert command only available for root, instead of regular users? And is there any way I can change that?\n\nA: Your suggestion is incorrect. Convert is available for all users.\nIf you're converting into a PDF and you're seeing Unable to open image 'xxx.pdf', the program has tried to open xxx.pdf for writing and has been rebuffed by the Kernel because the current user can't write to that file. There are a couple of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The current $USER can't write to the current directory. Try touch testfile and if that fails look at the directory permissions with stat .. To fix, either go to a directory where you can write, change the directory's permissions to allow $USER to write or change your user (eg add it to the right group) to allow it to write.\nThere are various ACL options on top of this but it's most likely you're just in a root-controlled directory in which case just go somewhere else.\n\n*There's already a file called xxx.pdf and it's owned by somebody else and $USER doesn't have write permission for it. Either sudo chown $USER: xxx.pdf (the : is not a typo), delete it and generate a new version from your $USER.\nBoth of these could be true at the same time.\n", "Q: Where to get latest stable Mesa?

I considered to create a partition to store it but I am not so sure. Also, after upgrading it, there is some way to re-install my old programs that were left in the old system? I mean, via Ubuntu Software Center?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Ubuntu supports in-place upgrades, and they're well tested.\nTo do an in-place upgrade from the command line all you need to do is sudo do-release-upgrade and follow the on-screen prompts.  New sources will be configured, new packages downloaded, and appropriate upgrade scripts run.  The process can take several hours, depending on the speed of your internet connection.\nWhat you don't really want to do is just install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS over top of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, because the appropriate upgrades won't take place.\n", "Q: Quick question about Ubuntu on External HDD I'm new to Ubuntu and after some Google search, I manage to install Ubuntu on my external drive (4 partitions) with the following setup:\nsdb1: Ubuntu and Grub (60gb)\nsdb2: swap (7GB)\nsdb3&4: file storages\nSo far it is working well for me, I can boot it on my laptop when I want to.\nQuestion is, will it be able to boot on any other laptops or pcs.

Initially the wireless connection was working well, but about two days ago I noticed a decline in the speed of the wireless connection. When I ping the router I'm getting results greater than 500 ms and sometimes I get 1700 ms whereas if I'm on a wired connection I get 0.4,0.3 and that means it's as fast as it's supposed to be.\nI never experienced the issue when I used Kubuntu on my old laptop, so I don't know what caused this as I didn't change any network settings. Even my colleagues in the office who use Windows have never complained of this.\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: Do:\necho \"options rt2800pci nohwcrypt=y\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rt2800pci.conf\nsudo modprobe -rfv rt2800pci\nsudo modprobe -v rt2800pci\n\nthat command changes encryption from hardware to software.\nDo:\ngksudo gedit /etc/pm/power.d/wireless\n\n(this will create or edit a configuration file that will override the default power management behavior) and enter the following: \n#!/bin/sh\n\n/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off \n\nabove exit0, then save gedit, close.\nSet your wireless settings in network manager to match the screenshots.\n\n\nReboot\n\nA: Are you getting a lot of dropped packets as well? I found that I had a lot of problems after moving to my apartment building. I used an Android app on my phone called WiFi Analyzer which shows the strengths of all the nearby wifi signals, as well as the channels they are running on. The suggestion I'd heard was to run your wifi on channel 1, 6, or 11, whichever has the least overlap from other nearby wireless routers. \nThe second thing I did was get a dual band router, since almost no one nearby is using those nearby frequencies. That helped me the most and all my devices now are running on 5Ghz (except the chromecast, which only runs on 2.4GHz).

So I went ahead and uninstalled from Ubuntu Desktop and my Android phone...\nI suppose I need to either takes some extra steps to allow KDE apps to run on my system, or maybe I need to do a custom build of the KDE Connect source?  \nHas anyone successfully got this app working under Gnome/Unity without heavy customization?  Or would I need to port the code from KDE to Gnome?   Any generic guides out there on how I would modify a KDE app to work in Gnome?\n\nA: Yes. Any KDE app will work under Unity.\nAll apps use the same \"core\" backends, namely the Ubuntu main packages. However, KDE apps need their own dependencies (the KDE/QT libraries). When you install the app through the Software Center, it will download not only Connect but all of the required KDE libraries. \nThe actual KDE environment won't be installed unless it is necessary, and I'm not sure whether it is needed for Connect. \nKubuntu, Lubuntu, and *buntu are all just derivatives of Ubuntu and can all run any program built for Ubuntu, as long as its dependencies are set.\nJust a warning though:\nThe KDE/QT UI clashing with the Unity/GTK UI can look pretty ugly. A good theme could sort this out though.\n\nIf you installed it and it didn't appear to work, you might have to manually run the command. Sometimes menu entries aren't updated. \n", "Q: What can I do to help make Ubuntu better for iMac users? When I installed Ubuntu on my workplace's aluminum iMac (2012), I realized it was far from working.

Isn't Ubuntu supposed to \"just work\"? With a lot of hunting around and a lot of experimentation, I managed to get some of it working by installing proprietary drivers through a PPA, using an alternative Bluetooth manager, blacklisting wifi drivers, editing my ALSA configs, and so on. I really think that this process would be a barrier to entry for owners of similar hardware that would like to try Ubuntu. How can I contribute to the way Ubuntu works out-of-the-box on this machine? Basically I'd like to write some script, and contribute it to Ubuntu, that detects if a user is on an iMac 2012, and if so, runs a series of tasks that gets it working correctly. Where do I start for that? Are there machine-specific setup scripts somewhere that run on installation? \n\nA: Technically, it works but with a very low performance. Some tweaks are usually needed.\nYou can contribute to the Mactel community in the official Ubuntu wiki, most of their documents are outdated and need people like you to improve them.\nThe matter of post-installation, there is a great answer to solve your doubts\nFrom the Ubuntu documentation:\n\nIf you want to program brand-new features specifically for Ubuntu or redesign and develop current ones, there are several ways to get you started:\nLook through the list of Ubuntu specifications on Launchpad. Pick one that interests you, and hopefully there should be enough information to begin with an implementation.\nWrite and package brand new software for Ubuntu. Contact the MOTUs to get new software into the Ubuntu Universe so that people can try it out and give you feedback.

I am trying to make Tomcat 7 working with Eclipse, and I am not sure if my JAVA_HOME is correct. \n~$ echo $JAVA_HOME \n/usr/lib/jvm/default-java\n\nAnd there is no such catalog!\nI only have:\n~$ ls /usr/lib/jvm/\njava-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64  java-7-openjdk-amd64\n\nIs my JAVA_HOME correct?\n\nA: Well I think you almost got it. You can use this command to detect where your jvm is located.\n\nwhereis jvm\n\nI have same setting and I believe you can point on either dir in JAVA_HOME as java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64 is a weak link to other( see man for ln).\nAh and Answer \"it is not correct! Take one from pwd command.\"\n\nA: Your JAVA_HOME setting is fine.\nThe file /usr/lib/jvm/default-java should be a symlink pointing to the JRE and is provided by the default-jre-headless package. This package is required for a regular Java (default JRE) installation of Java in Ubuntu. Apparently you removed this symlink, removed the individual package or something like that, or, you installed the JRE in an alternative matter.\nI'd suggest to make sure you install the JRE again with the specific package as well.\nsudo apt-get install default-jre default-jre-headless\n\nAnd to verify the correct JVM is selected as default Java:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\nsudo update-alternatives --config javaws # optional, java web plugin\n\nThen you should be all fine with the default settings.\n", "Q: Fix for xubuntu/xrdp tab/autocomplete in multi-user environment There are a number of threads throughout the internet about the xubuntu/xfce/xrdp issue where tab/autocomplete doesn't work in a remote session, and most eventually point back to this page for the solution: http://codebangers.com/?p=134.\nCodeBangers suggest using the GUI, but here is the same solution sone in the terminal:\n~$ cp .config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml \\\n      .config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml.bak\n~$ sed -i -e 's/<property name=\"\\&lt;Super\\&gt;Tab\" type=\"string\" value=\"switch_window_key\"\\/>/<property name=\"\\&lt;Super\\&gt;Tab\" type=\"empty\"\\/>/' \\\n             .config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml\n\nThe problem is, this only fixes the issue for the current user.

Or would they system simply ignore it (or not notice it is there)?\n\nA: I have done this before, with no negative effects.\nI have a set of virtual servers and I log in to them by authenticating with LDAP. Some of the VMs are not configured correctly and don't create a home directory when a new LDAP user logs in.\nSo in the past I have logged in, created a directory in /home that matches my username. Then when I log back in it treats it as my home directory.\nHowever, all those user files like .bashrc that are usually created in a home dir are not there. Which is to be expected.\nYou also need to change the permissions of the directory so it matches a home directory.\n\nA: A directory in /home is just like any other directory. Without a corresponding entry in the passwd database (whether the file itself or in AD) it has no special status. I have made directories there by accident (a cd too many) with no side effects. Of course, for all our LDAP users we create the home directories manually in the NFS server, copy over /etc/skel, then do a chown and other things. When the user logs in, they use their home directories normally.\n", "Q: Samba Sharing on Mapped Share I am running Ubuntu Server 14.04 with the latest samba.  I have a Windows 2008 Storage Server NAS with a shared drive, that I mount in fstab in my Ubuntu.  Everything works great.\nMy dilemma is that I want to share the mapped drive from Ubuntu, not the little Nas device with Windows.  The share does publish, but nobody can write to it.  I've tried everything, including forcing permissions.  The Windows box has been setup with easy access (everyone) permissions for simplicity.  No matter what I do the system will not allow me to write files to it over the network.  \nI realize I could just have network users write directly to the NAS, which would work fine I suppose.  I'd rather control it all through the Linux file server though, and more or less hide the NAS from users.  \nThought this would be simple through Linux/Samba, but apparently it can't be done through Samba.  The Windows box is obviously NTFS which could have something to do with it.\nWorst case, I could setup an iSCSI connection between the NAS and Ubuntu.  I'd rather avoid that if possible though.    \n\nA: Okay, I'll answer my own question.  It is definitely possible.\nThe entry in fstab should be like this\n//host/share /mnt/folder username=something,password=password,uid=65534,gid=65534,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,utf8, 0 0 \n\nI love Linux.

I have a problem.\nI have installed Tomcat7 with apt-get and it works fine. But, when I try to start this server from Eclipse it fails with error:\n\nCould not load the Tomcat server configuration at /Servers/Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost-config. The configuration may be corrupt or\n\nincomplete. Could not load the Tomcat server configuration at\n  /Servers/Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost-config. The configuration may\n  be corrupt or incomplete.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: There are possible configurations that would work out for you in line with creating symbolic links to tomcat7 directories but the simplest would be you to download a tomcat tar ball, extract it in your home directory an point eclipse to it\n\nA: I think there is a permission problem. You can solve this problem\nby either changing the permission of tomcat installation directory or \nby changing the ownership of the tomcat installation directory. \nChanging the ownership: \nLet's say that there is a user: tookuk and group: tookuk then \nyou can change the ownership of directory from root:root to \ntookuk:tookuk like this: \nsudo chown -R tookuk:tookuk apache-tomcat-directory/\n\nfor example If you have installed tomcat in /opt/tomcat then the command will be:\nsudo chown -R tookuk:tookuk /opt/tomcat/\n\n\nA: It is a permission problem because Eclipse thinks your user account has access to all of the conf files in /etc/tomcat8 (even if they are linked).  You can change the permissions on the linked folders and make sure the links are set correctly.\nHowever, after finally getting that all to work, I realized that by NOT using the distro release of Tomcat, I could put a full server in a single directory structure (vs links to /etc/tomcat8 and /var/log/tomcat8).  This made Eclipse much happier and there was no need to update links or permissions.\nBoth of these solutions work, one is much simpler to set up.\n", "Q: How to set bright at maximum permanently (I've already got a solution, do anyone have a better one?) I have to reinstall ubuntu in my Samsung N210 laptop, and now it won't let me set the brightness by hand. This seems to be something related to my BIOS but after looking for it, there's no new release on Samsung.\nI've search all over the web, and found that the only thing to solve this is to manually set it this way:\nsudo setpci -s 00:02.0 f4.b=ff\n\nAfter that the bright is at maximum.\nNow, this is my father's pc, and the only way he can read with it, is with the brightness set on maximum. With this solution, I need to manually type it every single time I turn on the pc.\nI wanted to make those changes permanent, and the only thing that worked was this solution. (I even tried this one) that even says that the solution that actually worked in my case, is not safe enough.\nI just would like to know if there's any new solution to this, or maybe some workaround, because it seems that every time I need to reinstall ubuntu I'm going to bump into this (I mean, I have this issue since 12.x version, and this isn't solved in new versions).\nAny thoughts on this?\n\nA: Add the command sudo setpci -s 00:02.0 f4.b=ff to the end of /etc/rc.local\nThis will force the command to run at every startup.\n", "Q: Which US international keyboard layout gives me all umlauts and sharp S? I would like to use a US keyboard layout. However, from time to time I need to type German umlauts and sharp S.\nAll the US international keyboard layouts have left me unsatisfied. I am always either missing sharp S or a way to type the umlauts.\nDoes anyone have a configuration where they are able to use both sharp S and all umlauts with a US international keyboard layout? If so, would you share how you achieved this?\n\nA: I use a regular US keyboard layout, but for all extended characters I mapped the print screen key or the right Windows/Super key to be the compose key. So now when I need a ç I type PrtSc followed by the c and , keys. Similarly for characters like ß (PrtScss) or © (PrtScOc).\nSee the Wikipedia entry on the compose key for more information. To set the Compose key (in Gnome), you can try Settings → keyboard → Shortcuts tab → compose key option, but that doesn't list the PrtSc key I want, so I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf-editor: sudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\n*Open dconf-editor and go to org → gnome → desktop → input-sources and change xkb-options to ['compose:prsc']\n\nA: I found two good ways to do it in Ubuntu.\n[1] altgr-intl Layout\nFirst one is to put this into the terminal or if you want it permanent into the .bashrc file:\nsetxkbmap -rules evdev -model evdev -layout us -variant altgr-intl\nAfterwards when clicking the right-alt-key/altgr-key the whole keyboard changes into phoentics. Here are the important ones:\n\n*\n\n*altgr+q = ä, altg+Q = Ä\n\n*altgr+p = ö, altgr+P = Ö\n\n*altgr+y = ü, altgr+Y = Ü\n\n*altgr+s = ß\nPress buttons at the same time.\nProblems:\n\n*\n\n*there seems to be only one ß (no ẞ)\n\n*might not work, when altgr button is set to be the compose button\n\n*need to learn shortcuts\n\n[2] Set a compose button\nA second way is to set a compose button.\nInstall Ubuntu Tweaks sudo apt-get install gnome-tweaks and start it. Click on Keyboard and Mouse and on Compose Key. Activate it and select a button you like, for example right-alt.\nNow you can do:\n\n*\n\n*compose key + \" + a = ä\n\n*compose key + \" + A = Ä\n\n*compose key + \" + u = ü\n\n*compose key + \" + U = Ü\n\n*compose key + \" + o = ö\n\n*compose key + \" + O = Ö\n\n*compose key + ss = ß\n\n*compose key + SS = ẞ\nPress buttons after each other.\nProblems:\n\n*\n\n*more clicks, slower\n\n\nA: Use the English (US, international AltGr Unicode combining) option. This enables the AltGr (right alt key) to act as an option to access more characters. \n", "Q: Overwrite an existing directory? I have a directory name foo located in ~/Desktop. Suppose I want to create a directory from a terminal with same name and in the same location. When I tried mkdir it gave an error:\nmkdir: cannot create directory `/home/nux/Desktop/foo': File exists\n\nThats makes sense, but I want to replace foo if exists. I looked through man mkdir but there isn't any option that do that.\nSo how to overwrite foo directory?\nWhy doesn't mkdir have an option to do this?\n\nA: No, there is no single command to do what you are asking.\nWhy?\n\n\nThis is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together.1\n\n\nIn this instance, the mkdir and rm commands do what you require, and work well together, since rm -r will delete the directory as well, so a subsequent mkdir will create the directory.\n1The Art of Unix Programming, Eric S. Raymond, itself quoting Doug McIlroy.\n\nA: If your goal is to execute a one-line command that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removes and recreates the directory ~/Desktop/foo if it already exists.\n\n*Just creates the directory ~/Desktop/foo if it does not already exist.\n\n\nThen you can use:\nrm -r ~/Desktop/foo; mkdir ~/Desktop/foo\n\n; is equivalent to a newline, but it lets you execute multiple commands on a single line (i.e., as a \"single command\").\n\n\n*\n\n*If the directory you're removing may contain readonly files, you'll need the -f flag to remove them without prompting the user interactively. This is okay, but I do recommend being especially careful with rm -rf .... See man rm for details.\n\n*You need the rm command to finish before the mkdir command executes; this is the reason to use ; instead of &. (A command preceding & runs asynchronously in the background.)\n\n*You need the mkdir command to run when the rm command succeeds; this is the reason to use ; instead of ||.\n\n*You need the mkdir command to run when the rm command fails (usually failure will mean the directory didn't already exist); this is the reason to use ; instead of &&.\n\n*The rm command might fail even when the directory already existed, in which case the mkdir command will fail also, but the error messages will make sense and there's probably no need to add a middle step checking for foo's existence before trying to create it.\n\n\nSee 3.2.3 Lists of Commands in the Bash Reference Manual for more information and explanation about the ;, &, ||, and && operators.\nAs muru suggested (and Rinzwind elaborated), I do recommend you look into rsync to see if it will meet your backup needs. There are some additional useful guides on the rsync documentation page, as well as this Ubuntu rsync guide.\n\nwhy mkdir doesn't has this option ?\n\nmkdir creates directories (the \"mk\" stands for \"make\"). For it also to recursively delete directories and all the files in them would be bad, because it would violate the principle of least astonishment in a way that would likely lead to data loss.\nrmdir doesn't even remove directories that have any (non-directory) files in them. rm has an -r option, which makes sense since rm is expected to remove files (that is its purpose, thus the inherent danger is intuitive and users typically know to be careful when running rm commands).\n\nA: The command to remove a directory is rm. So you need 2 commands.\nrm -r ~/Desktop/foo/\nmkdir ~/Desktop/foo/\n\nAs shown in comments you can chain them with  ; (= do both even if 1st fails) or && (= only mkdir when the rm does not fail).\nThe -r is for removing  dirs. The 1st command also removes ALL contents of the directory. If that is NOT your intention both rm and mkdir are not what you are looking for: permissions are chmod and chown.\n\nwhy mkdir doesn't has this option ?\n\nAmbiguity. mkdir means make directory. Not remove and make directory. And since the rm command is for deleting stuff there is no need for rmdir to be able to remove a directory. \n\nA: To do that in the cleanest way I use this:\ncreate_clean_directory(){\n    dir_name=$1\n    if [ -d \"$dir_name\" ]; then\n        echo \"Removing $dir_name\"\n        rm -rf \"$dir_name\"\n    elif [ -f \"$dir_name\" ]; then\n        echo \"File with this name already exists, not a directory.\"\n        exit\n    fi\n    if mkdir \"$dir_name\"; then\n        echo \"Clean directory created: $dir_name\"\n        return 0\n    else\n        echo \"Creating directory failed: $dir_name\"\n        return 1\n    fi \n}\n\nAnd to use it:\ncreate_clean_directory <dir_name>\n\nThis makes sure that what you are trying to remove is a directory and not a file:\n\n\n*\n\n*-d Check if a directory with that name already exists. if so, delete it.\n\n*-f Check that no file with this name exists. if so, print error message and exit.\n\n*Create the new directory and echo success, or if failed, echo failed.\n", "Q: Automatic screen capture script I'm looking to accomlish exactly what Anwar Shah describes here Bash script to take screenshot and save the image - Ubuntu \nwith the added functionality of setting a time increment for the script to continue taking screen captures. For example, I'd like to be able to execute this script and have it take and export screen shots as jpegs every 5 seconds and continue until I kill the script. \nIs there any simple solution to this? \n\nA: Yes:\n#! /bin/bash\nwhile sleep 5\ndo    \n    shutter -f -o 'myshot-%T.jpg' -e\ndone\n\nThe sleep command can take various time durations as arguments: 5s (or just 5) for 5 seconds, 129m for 129 minutes, etc.\nThe shutter command supports JPEG output, and the %T tells Shutter to automatically replace that part with the time of the script.\n (There's also %NN to tell Shutter to use a counter.)\n\nA: In my .bashrc, I define a function, screenshot to use ImageMagik:\n    screenshot ()\n    {\n        import -window root ~/var/screenshot/$(tshhmmss)_screendump.png\n    }  \nand, for the timestamp,  \nalias tshhmmss='date +%y%b%d-%H%M%S'\n\nThen, wrapping it in while sleep 5 ... is easy.\n", "Q: switch user not working in Xubuntu 14.04 When I click the switch user in the Actions Buttons in my panel, I get this message:\nGDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.gnome.DisplayManager was not provided by any .service files\n\nI get the same message if I lock the screen and then select New Login option (I'm using xscreensaver).\nIf I type dm-tool switch-to-greeter in terminal I get into the login screen and can enter with a new user but that is not an elegant method.

There are some bkp-prefixed files, that shouldn't exist in EFI/Microsoft, leading me to believe this is another case of boot-repair bringing more confusion to UEFI setups than necessary.\nBackup the whole data on the partition, copy the bkp files back to where they should be (just remove the bkp prefix). Install a boot loader like rEFInd or gummiboot to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi and probably have a look at efibootmgr.\nThe boot-repair author doesn't care very much about how UEFI is intended to work.

Both are also scriptable. The mkfs commands are not interactive.\n\nfdisk\nfdisk expects a device (such as /dev/sda) as an argument.

I'll just focus on:\n\nparted\nparted doesn't need an argument (it tries to \"guess\"), but you should always specify the disk. Given the choice, parted is the program you should prefer.

You should replace that with the device you need (/dev/sda, for example).\nFirst, if your disk doesn't have a partition table, we must create one:\nparted /tmp/part mklabel gpt\n\nor mklabel msdos, if you want the old-school 4-primary-partition thing (called MBR or MSDOS partition table).\nThen we make, say, an ext4 partition starting starting at 3GB (i.e., leaving the initial 3G free) and of size 2GB (i.e., ending at 5GB). parted expects locations in MB for mkpartfs, but we can specify the suffix:\nparted /tmp/part mkpart primary ext4 3G 5G\n\nAnd another, now an NTFS partition of 1GB:\nparted /tmp/part mkpart primary ntfs 5G 6G\n\nResult:\n# parted /tmp/part print\nModel:  (file)\nDisk /tmp/blah: 10.4GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags\n 1      3000MB  5000MB  2000MB               primary\n 2      5000MB  6000MB  1000MB               primary  msftdata\n\nNote how it uses SI prefixes, whereas GParted steadfastly uses binary prefixes (while dropping the silly i).\nI'll label the partitions:\n# parted /tmp/part name 1 hello\n# parted /tmp/part name 2 world\n# parted /tmp/part print\nModel:  (file)\nDisk /tmp/blah: 10.4GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name   Flags\n 1      3000MB  5000MB  2000MB               hello\n 2      5000MB  6000MB  1000MB               world  msftdata\n\nWhile parted can create partitions of filesystem ntfs just fine, it can't format an existing partition (!) to NTFS:\nmkfs partition fs-type\n         Make a filesystem fs-type on partition. fs-type can be one \n         of \"fat16\", \"fat32\", \"ext2\", \"linux-swap\", or \"reiserfs\".\n\nIndeed, parted will tell you that you should use it for manipulating partitions, not filesystems, which brings me to:\n\nmkfs\nmkfs, like fsck, is essentially a frontend to various filesystem-specific commands. On my system for example, mkfs.bfs, mkfs.cramfs, mkfs.ext2, mkfs.ext3, mkfs.ext4, mkfs.ext4dev, mkfs.fat, mkfs.minix, mkfs.msdos ,mkfs.ntfs, mkfs.vfat are available.\nNow, unfortunately, while parted operates just fine on a file, like the one I used above, mkfs can't go hunting for partitions in such files. In fact, it expects block devices, so if I'm going to use a new file /tmp/file for mkfs, I have to force it do so. You'll use the block device corresponding to the partition you want to format, such as /dev/sda2.\nThe general syntax for mkfs is:\n# mkfs --help\nUsage: mkfs [options] [-t type fs-options] device [size]\n\nOptions:\n -t, --type=TYPE  file system type, when undefined ext2 is used\n     fs-options   parameters to real file system builder\n     device       path to a device\n     size         number of blocks on the device\n -V, --verbose    explain what is done\n                  defining -V more than once will cause a dry-run\n -V, --version    output version information and exit\n                  -V as version must be only option\n -h, --help       display this help and exit\n\nFor more information, see mkfs(8).\n\nAs you can see, the -t flag lets us pass filesystem-specific flags. For example, NTFS flags:\n# mkfs.ntfs --help \nUsage: mkntfs [options] device [number-of-sectors]\n\nBasic options:\n    -f, --fast                      Perform a quick format\n    -Q, --quick                     Perform a quick format\n    -L, --label STRING              Set the volume label\n    -C, --enable-compression        Enable compression on the volume\n    -I, --no-indexing               Disable indexing on the volume\n    -n, --no-action                 Do not write to disk\n\nAdvanced options:\n    -c, --cluster-size BYTES        Specify the cluster size for the volume\n    -s, --sector-size BYTES         Specify the sector size for the device\n    -p, --partition-start SECTOR    Specify the partition start sector\n    -H, --heads NUM                 Specify the number of heads\n    -S, --sectors-per-track NUM     Specify the number of sectors per track\n    -z, --mft-zone-multiplier NUM   Set the MFT zone multiplier\n    -T, --zero-time                 Fake the time to be 00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970\n    -F, --force                     Force execution despite errors\n\nOutput options:\n    -q, --quiet                     Quiet execution\n    -v, --verbose                   Verbose execution\n        --debug                     Very verbose execution\n\nHelp options:\n    -V, --version                   Display version\n    -l, --license                   Display licensing information\n    -h, --help                      Display this help\n\nDevelopers' email address: ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net\nNews, support and information:  http://tuxera.com\n\nSo let's make an NTFS partition, with quick formatting (-Q), forcing it to operate on a non-block-device file (-F), and setting a label (-L \"hello world\").\n# mkfs -t ntfs -F -Q -L \"hello world\" /tmp/file\n/tmp/file is not a block device.\nmkntfs forced anyway.\nThe sector size was not specified for /tmp/file and it could not be obtained automatically.  It has been set to 512 bytes.\nThe partition start sector was not specified for /tmp/file and it could not be obtained automatically.  It has been set to 0.\nThe number of sectors per track was not specified for /tmp/file and it could not be obtained automatically.  It has been set to 0.\nThe number of heads was not specified for /tmp/file and it could not be obtained automatically.  It has been set to 0.\nCluster size has been automatically set to 4096 bytes.\nTo boot from a device, Windows needs the 'partition start sector', the 'sectors per track' and the 'number of heads' to be set.\nWindows will not be able to boot from this device.\nCreating NTFS volume structures.\nmkntfs completed successfully. Have a nice day.\n\nClearly it didn't enjoy working on a file. :) Don't worry, it should automatically detect most values when working on an actual disk. Even this \"file\" works fine as a filesystem:\n# mount -t ntfs-3g /tmp/file /mnt\n# touch \"/mnt/a file in mnt\"\n# ls -l /mnt\ntotal 0\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Aug 29 06:43 a file in mnt\n# umount /mnt\n# ls -l /mnt\ntotal 0\n\n(See the weird permissions?)\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*I haven't used sudo anywhere in this answer yet. Since I was operating on files, and files owned by me, I didn't need sudo. parted will warn you about this. For block devices, which are usually always owned by root, you will need sudo (or you'll have to use a root shell via sudo -i or sudo su -).\n\n*parted is a GNU program, and like many GNU programs, has extensive documentation in the info format. Install parted-doc (sudo apt-get install parted-doc) and then run info parted. You can also checkout the online user's manual.\n\n*GParted is able to format a partition to NTFS as it calls the appropriate mkfs program directly (mkntfs, in this case - mkfs.ntfs is just a link to mkntfs). It also sets a number of parameters. In fact, for most operations, you can examine the details of the GParted messages to see which commands were run.\n\n*I won't go into the merits of GPT vs MBR/MSDOS partition tables, but GPT is likely to be found on new devices with UEFI, especially if you got Windows 8 on them. The state of partitioning tools? discusses what tools are available if you're facing GPT.\n\n*LVM, ZFS and btrfs are a whole another game. They all have their accompanying tools, and you should use them instead of parted or fdisk (except perhaps for an initial step of creating partitions for their use).\n\nNote on parted usage:\nThe syntax of the parted program is:\nparted [options] [device [command [options...]...]]\n\nWhen you run parted without a command, like:\nparted /tmp/parted\n\nYou'll be presented a simple shell, where you can run the above commands. However, these commands can also be run directly using the parted program. So these three are equivalent:\n# parted /tmp/parted\nGNU Parted 2.3\nUsing /tmp/parted\nWelcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.\n(parted) mklabel gpt\n\nAnd\n# parted\nGNU Parted 2.3\nUsing /dev/sda\nWelcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.\n(parted) select /tmp/parted\nUsing /tmp/parted\n(parted) mklabel gpt\n\nAnd\nparted /tmp/parted mklabel gpt\n\nNote also that, when creating partitions with parted, a useful indicator of end of partitions is -1s (this is \"1\" between the hyphen and the \"s\"). This is useful if you want your partition to span from a specified start to the rest of the disk. To be more specific, running\nparted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary ext4 3G -1s\n\nwill create a partition of /dev/sda that starts at 3G and ends at the last sector of the /dev/sda disk (i.e. it spans from 3G to the whole remainder of the disk). Note that the -- is necessary, for 1s not to be interpreted as an invalid option.\n\nA: First you how to actually partition your hard drive with the fdisk utility.\nLinux allows only 4 primary partitions. You can have a much larger number of logical partitions by sub-dividing one of the primary partitions. \nOnly one of the primary partitions can be sub-divided.\nfdisk is started by typing as root fdisk device at the command prompt. \nDevice might be something like /dev/sda or /dev/sdb\nThe basic fdisk commands you need are:\np print the partition table\n\nn create a new partition\n\nd delete a partition\n\nq quit without saving changes\n\nw write the new partition table and exit\n\nChanges you make to the partition table do not take effect until you issue the write (w) command. \nHere is a sample partition table:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 64 heads, 63 sectors, 621 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 4032 * 512 bytes\n\n   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *         1       184    370912+  83  Linux\n/dev/sdb2           185       368    370944   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb3           369       552    370944   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb4           553       621    139104   82  Linux swap\n\nExample:\nStart fdisk from the shell prompt:\nsudo su\nfdisk /dev/sdb \n\nWhich indicates that You are using the second drive on your SATA controller.\nCommand (m for help): p\n\nDisk /dev/hdb: 64 heads, 63 sectors, 621 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 4032 * 512 bytes\n\nThat makes for 384Mb per partition. \nNow You get to work.\n\n\nCommand (m for help): n\nCommand action\n   e   extended\n   p   primary partition (1-4)\np\nPartition number (1-4): 1\nFirst cylinder (1-621, default 1):<RETURN>\nUsing default value 1\nLast cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (1-621, default 621): +384M\n\nNext, You set up the partition You want to use for swap:\n\n\nCommand (m for help): n\nCommand action\n   e   extended\n   p   primary partition (1-4)\np\nPartition number (1-4): 2\nFirst cylinder (197-621, default 197):<RETURN>\nUsing default value 197\nLast cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (197-621, default 621): +128M\n\nNow the partition table looks like this:\n Device Boot      Start       End    Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1             1       196    395104   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb2           197       262    133056   83  Linux\n\nFinally, You make the first partition bootable:\nCommand (m for help): a\nPartition number (1-4): 1\n\nAnd You make the second partition of type swap:\n\n\nCommand (m for help): t\nPartition number (1-4): 2\nHex code (type L to list codes): 82\nChanged system type of partition 2 to 82 (Linux swap)      \nCommand (m for help): p\n\nThe end result:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 64 heads, 63 sectors, 621 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 4032 * 512 bytes\n\n   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *         1       196    395104+  83  Linux\n/dev/sdb2           197       262    133056   82  Linux swap\n\nFinally, You issue the write command (w) to write the table on the disk.\n\nmkfs utility is used to create filesystem (ext2, ext3, ext4, etc) on your Linux system.\nYou should specify the device name to mkfs on which the filesystem to be created.\nView the Available Filesystem Builder Commands\nThe filesystem builders (mkfs* commands) are usually searched in directories like /sbin/, /sbin/fs, /sbin/fs.d, /etc/fs and /etc. \nIf not found, finally it searches the directories found in the PATH variable.\nThe following list shows the available mkfs* commands in a system.\nsudo su\ncd /sbin\nls mkfs*\n\nmkfs  mkfs.bfs  mkfs.cramfs  mkfs.ext2  mkfs.ext3  mkfs.ext4  mkfs.ext4dev  \nmkfs.minix  mkfs.msdos  mkfs.ntfs  mkfs.vfat\n\nBuild a Filesystem on a Specific Device\nIn order to build the filesystem using mkfs command, the required arguments are device-filename and filesystem-type as shown below. \nThe following example creates ext4 filesystem on /dev/sdb1 partition.\nsudo su\nmkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 \n\nmke2fs 1.42 (29-Nov-2011)\nFilesystem label=\nOS type: Linux\nBlock size=4096 (log=2)\nFragment size=4096 (log=2)\nStride=0 blocks, Stripe width=0 blocks\n1120112 inodes, 4476416 blocks\n223820 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user\nFirst data block=0\nMaximum filesystem blocks=0\n137 block groups\n32768 blocks per group, 32768 fragments per group\n8176 inodes per group\nSuperblock backups stored on blocks: \n    32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208, \n    4096000\n\nAllocating group tables: done                            \nWriting inode tables: done                            \nCreating journal (32768 blocks): done\nWriting superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done   \n\nPlease note that the default filesystem type for mkfs command is ext2. \nIf you don’t specify “-t” option, it will create ext2 filesystem.\nAlso, you can use the method we discussed earlier to identify whether you have ext2 or ext3 or ext4 file system.\n\nFormat An NTFS Drive \nFirst, you’re going to need the ability to create NTFS file systems, so install ntfsprogs:\nsudo su \napt-get install ntfs-3g\n\nSecond, You blow away the partition and re-create it as NTFS. \nsudo su \numount /dev/sdb1\nfdisk /dev/sdb\n\nOptions to select:\n\n    ‘d’ to delete the partition\n    ‘n’ to create a new partition\n    ‘p’ for primary\n    ‘1’ for partition number\n    ‘Enter’ for first cylinder (default 1)\n    ‘Enter’ for last cylinder (default of max size)\n    ‘t’ for type\n    ‘L’ to list codes, and enter code for HPFS/NTFS. In my case, it’s ‘7’\n    ‘w’ to write changes to disk, and exit\n\numount /dev/sdb1\n\nIn the last step, You unmount the partition, because Ubuntu auto-mounted it again for You. \nNow, You need to create the file system. There are two ways to go about it: the impatient way (Quick Format), or the better but much longer way (Full Format).\nQuick Format\nThis just allocates the disk space, but doesn’t zero out the drive or check for bad sectors. This means it’ll take a few seconds.\nsudo su \nmkfs.ntfs -f /dev/sdb1\n\nFull Format\nIf you’re much more concerned about data integrity and don’t mind waiting, do a full format. \nThis may take a few hours to zero out a large drive!\nsudo su \nmkfs.ntfs /dev/sdb1\n\n", "Q: Charm Using RabbitMQ Here is problem:\n1) I have a RabbitMQ on Juju.\n2) I have a charm which tries to use RabbitMQ, written in Java (I'll call it myCharm).\n3) myCharm needs Hostname or IP address of RabbitMQ.\nHow can I find the IP address or hostname of RabbitMQ on my Juju?\n\nA: You need to ensure your charm can relate to rabbitmq-server using the rabbitmq relation. For examples of other charms that already do this, take a look at https://manage.jujucharms.com/interfaces/rabbitmq.\nOnce you do that, deploying both rabbitmq charm and your charm and running juju add-relation rabbitmq mycharm will trigger a relation hook inside your charm where you can use the relation-get hostname command to get the IP.\nFor a much more detailed explanation of how relations work, check the excellent link Jorge Castro provided in the comment above.\n", "Q: How to enable my flashdrive while im in the BIOS Setup Utility Im trying to install Ubuntu 32bits on my ASUS Eee PC.

One day my company is going to need a server, and I like Ubuntu since it has the least amount of viruses out of all the OSes (I think), but when I look at the Ubuntu Server it only has black background and white text, which is command line. Is that all to Ubuntu Server? Or is it like Ubuntu Desktop, and a modules for command line? I don't really want it to just be the command line.\nI'm new to the Ubuntu OS stuff. Even now I still use windows.\n\nA: If you build a public facing server, you should be familiar and comfortable with the system you are using.\nYou mention virus protection as a reason, which suggests to me that you are looking for \"security as a product\", which is something that doesn't exist. Security is always a process, and servers on public networks need to be monitored and maintained constantly -- this is true for both Windows and Linux.\nThe keys to reducing the work load doing so are\n\n\n*\n\n*minimizing attack surface\n\n*automatisation\n\n\nI've found that to be easier to do in Linux/Unix environments, because Windows's greatest strength, which is the tight integration of components, is actually a hindrance here.\nIt is completely impossible to build a Windows system that does not have a web browser component installed (which includes functions to download and execute JavaScript code, which can in turn then load ActiveX components), simply because Explorer requires that component. An ideal server environment contains only the code necessary for the services provided, and nothing else.\nAt the same time, integration of components provides very efficient communication channels for the use cases they have been designed for, but for automated monitoring of services, it is often required to combine them in unanticipated ways, which requires scripting. The Windows philosophy that the scripting environment only provides control flow and data is passed between components is a sound one, but slightly more difficult to debug than a program writing a text file which you can manually inspect before passing it to the next program.\nThe preference many administrators have for the command line is simply that it is the same language they use for scripting. After investigating an issue, I can simply dump my command history into a file, remove a few irrelevant lines and I have a working script I can use when a similar issue appears. Using a GUI, I'd have to manually retrace what I just did, find out what the proper API is to perform the same step, then write a program and debug it without interrupting service.\nLast but not least: the alternative to running your own server is to get a managed server, where someone else is tasked with the ongoing maintenance. They can do that more efficiently than you, because they have a monitoring infrastructure in place already, so the effort to add your server to their system is negligible, and they can detect and take care of urgent issues even on the night shift.\n\nA: Ubuntu Server is designed to be a scale out server operating system for professionals.\nIt's a stripped down OS with no frills attached. The target audience for Ubuntu Server is someone who is comfortable with the command line. Some would even make the argument that it's not designed for the command line, it's so stripped down that it's designed to be driven by configuration management tools like Chef, Puppet, and Ansible, and by orchestration tools like Juju as a baseline image for higher level infrastructure (things like Cloud Foundry if you want a PaaS, or OpenStack if you want IaaS, or any combination of all these things). \nIf you're looking to do dense deployments with Docker containers, or high density OpenStack deployments, then that's what Ubuntu Server is for. \nThat being said, in the right conditions it can be a nice \"easy to use\" server for personal servers. Ubuntu doesn't really go after the small-scale personal server market.

That looks the best think to search if your employes/co-worker are not skilled in command line, if you don't have budget to get formation on it, or if you fear some social movement agaisnt it.\n\nA: The best way to use Ubuntu server is from the command line.

There are reasons that I use the title bar in windows which includes grabbing resource for moving (alt mouse cursor fails in a virtual machine).  I at times send the xeyes to my real machine as an easy visual that the remote machine is alive.  The missing title bar/boards makes it impossible (for me) to re-size it.

Minimum requirements statistics do not provide enough accurate info to new and prospective users trying to determine a suitable flavor for their machine. People need to know if an OS will run smoothly on their hardware. We need the ability to easily compare Ubuntu flavors in terms of resource usage and management. \nPoints of interest include:\nPerformance\n\n\n*\n\n*responsiveness under load (e.g. Firefox open with 10 tabs)\n\n*menu/dash speed \n\n\nResource usage\n\n\n*\n\n*memory usage\n\n*hard drive usage\n\n*3D graphics requirements\n\n\nThis data could be depicted using bar graphs and with different versions (13.04, 13.10, 14.04, etc) in separate graphs but most important are the latest versions.\nHow do they compare under standard use case scenarios such as using Firefox, LibreOffice, or watching full screen flash videos or Netflix? Will my machine be snappy and responsive running Ubuntu or am I better off with Lubuntu or Xubuntu? What are the minimum system requirements for a reasonable speedy and responsive system? Official minimum hardware requirements specifications do not provide this info.  \n\nA: The only difference between the different flavours of Ubuntu is the installed desktop.\nThe basic minimum system requirements of several Ubuntu desktop respins is already covered in this question: What are the system requirements for each flavour of Ubuntu Desktop? \nTo address your list:\n\n\n*\n\n*memory usage: \nSee Memory consumption of Linux desktop environments\n\n*hard drive usage: \nSee What are the system requirements for each flavour of Ubuntu Desktop?\n\n*3D graphics requirements:\nThere are several articles on Phoronix comparing desktop performance. You will notice that when it comes to graphics, even though every desktop is running on the same software (Xorg+kernel), there are some performance differences due to the use of different compositors. \n\n\n*\n\n*6-Way Linux Desktop 2D/3D Performance Comparison On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Unity, XFCE, KDE, LXDE, Gnome and Openbox)\n\n*6-Way Desktop Comparison On Linux Mint 17 (Cinnamon, Gnome, KDE, XFCE, MATE and LXDE; Mint 17 is a derivative of Ubuntu 14.04)\n\n*8-Way Desktop Comparison On Ubuntu 13.10 Linux (Unity, XFCE, KDE, LXDE, Gnome, Openbox, and Razor-QT)\n\n*Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop Comparison: 6 Desktops, 5 Driver/GPU Combinations\n\n\n*responsiveness:\nThere have been benchmarks of the responsiveness of the Linux kernel scheduler, but desktop responsiveness has not been benchmarked as far as I am aware, probably because it is is laborious to do. The usual way is to record video of an input event (keyboard or mouse being used) and the monitor of the PC, and then play back the video and count the frames between the input event and the video response being completed.\n\nA: There is a resource usage I made a couple of days ago which I mentioned in one of your posts, in a graph it would look like this:\n\n\nThe source for both graphs is from What is the difference between Ubuntu and its derivatives? and as mentioned in there, they should be taken lightly, because they can vary. While I was doing the tests I noticed the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*For all cases if the maximum amount of RAM was lowered, their general RAM usage was also lower. For example, Lubuntu in a computer with 4 GB of RAM would use 165 MB of RAM. But if you took out 2 GB of RAM and only left 2 GB in total, it would use 125 MB of RAM. If I again took 1 GB out, leaving only 1 GB, it would use around 100 MB of RAM. So the normal RAM usage can vary depending on the amount of total RAM.\n\n*All Distributions adapt to their hardware. Which that said, if you have a low spec CPU, the usage might be more than the graph. If you have a more powerful CPU, they usage could be lower than the graph for that particular distribution. The same can be said about RAM. It should be noted that Linux tries to use as much resources as possible to have the most optimum system available. Not used RAM is wasted RAM. This type of thinking is NOT to be confused on how Windows uses RAM. Both use that extra RAM in different ways.\n\n*The values in the graphs can vary between hardware differences, distribution versions, desktop versions, updates and more. This are just to give the end user an idea on how they compare in one particular case scenario.\nFor FPS (Video Performance) I would seek Phoronix March 2014 Desktop Performance\nIf we grab the general FPS score for all FPS benchmark tests conducted there we would get the following graph:\n\nBut again, this type of benchmark can change a lot if we take into consideration the type of graphics card, driver version, distribution version, desktop version, etc..\nFor graphics requirements, they all don't ask for much, even KDE, Unity and Gnome, but you should have at least a video card that supports OpenGL 2.0+ (Right now, almost all do). If you want to measure how the desktops influence the FPS performance when using the Desktop interface, I could put this way:\nHeavy Desktops - KDE\nIntermediate Desktops - Unity, Gnome\nLightweight Desktops - Xfce, LXDE, OpenBox  \nThe data shown in Flexion, I feel is very accurate and gives an idea of the memory usage (Not CPU)\n| Desktop Environment  | Memory Used |\n| ---------------------|------------:|\n| Enlightenment 0.18.8 |    83.8 MiB |\n| LXDE 0.5.5           |    87.0 MiB |\n| XFCE 4.10.2          |   110.0 MiB |\n| LXQt 0.7.0           |   113.0 MiB |\n| MATE 1.8.1           |   123.0 MiB |\n| Cinnamon 2.2.13      |   176.3 MiB |\n| GNOME3 3.12.2        |   245.3 MiB |\n| KDE 4.13.1           |   302.6 MiB |\n| Unity 7.2.0.14       |   312.5 MiB |\n\nNow, to be fair, all Desktops from the time they were benchmarked have received numerous updates in regards to their rendering. That is why Phoronix made another FPS Benchmark in which we can see some improvements. The final result was that, at least for Unity, it gained around 10% better framerate in cases like the Xonotic 0.7 (1920x1080) where it went from 112 (Low Benchmark) & 42 (High Benchmark) to 120 (Low Benchmark) & 63 (High Benchmark).\nFor menu speed, this does not vary much on all distributions. It can be quicker on Unity (Using Dash) if you disable the Online Search in the Security & Privacy option in the System Settings.\nFinal Thoughts:\nWhen doing all of this tests, I found out more than I thought I would. For instance, I was really not expecting KDE to use that low amount of resources. I thought it would take like 1 GB of RAM. Another thing I found out was how quickly Lubuntu and Xubuntu were it terms of booting and using the whole system. of course, a almost common fact remains, the less resources a distribution uses, the less options you will have. \nSo a user of Kubuntu or Ubuntu can enjoy several features like Samba sharing, easier printing configuration and many other features but an OpenBox or LXDE user would have it more difficult or would take longer to achieve the same objectives (Like sharing a folder). \nIf you wish to see CPU/RAM specific usage for the cases mentioned here I invite you to read What is the difference between Ubuntu and its derivatives? which shows how each distribution behaved under different loads, apart from other information.\n", "Q: Queries about Ubuntu touch I want to install Ubuntu touch on my Nexus 4 but , before installing i want to know that whether the basic applications can be installed on it , like twitter ,  Google maps , banking apps and others , what is the average battery life i would get after installing Ubuntu touch.Does it have any network issues.\n\nA: The most major apps are available like Twitter, Facebook or Google Maps.\nThe average battery lifetime are 2-3 days.\nNetwork functions (WLAN) running fine including daily updates (depends on your image).\nBut remember, everything is in a developing state.\n", "Q: can I get the document viewer Evince in Windows I want to get document viewer of Ubuntu working in Windows 7, is there any way to do it?

My problem is that being a newbie I can not get Ubuntu to boot.  I tried a few things (i.e. EasyBCD) and none have worked.  Where or what have I done wrong?\n\nA: In my opinion you need to change booting order, as your systems are installed in separate drives. On most computers when computer starts you can pop-up the boot menu, usually by pressing F12 of F10 key (message regarding the proper key is usually shown for a short time in the right bottom corner of the screen). Then choose the drive on which the Ubuntu is installed. If that works, and you would like to have such order always, you need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings.\n", "Q: *Solved* I'm trying to boot up Ubuntu using a USB, but the boot-up process is stuck Last night, the hard disk of my laptop encountered the click-of-death.

Thanks!\nNOTE: I'm aware of the following question: Not booting from USB or CD (SYSLINUX Message) - but my USB is already formatted FAT32 and the boot options are set to boot from USB (which shouldn't even matter I think since the BIOS will automatically try the next boot option anyway?). \nThe USB I'm using is an HP V210W 4GB Pen Drive, if that helps.\nI've already also done an md5sum check on the ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso file and the hash checks out.\n\nA: Solved it.

I recently installed the native Linux Spotify client on my Ubuntu 14.04, which works like a charm. The only thing that really really annoys me is that I get a notification for each new song that starts (so every couple minutes) which totally disturbes me in my work.\nThere doesn't seem to be an option to hide the notifications in the Spotify client, so I tried looking for a solution to disable notifications for a specific application. Searching around brought me to this AskUbuntu answer, but that only deals with changing colors of the notification or completely disabling them.\nSo my question; does anybody know of an application that can disable notifications for a specific application? All tips are welcome!\n\nA: (For context, I visited this question a while after original post)\nThe quickest way to disable notifications from Spotify only is to go to your account settings (on Linux Mint, open the dropdown menu in the top right where your name is, and select settings).\nScroll down until you the see \"Display Options\" section. One of the switches will say \"Show Desktop notifications when song changes\" and click on the switch. This will turn off the notifications.\nNote\nI would have preferred a solution that only mutes the notifications. I want to see the notification, but I don't want to hear it.\nBut this is good enough for me, a simple Alt+Tab isn't going to kill me.\n\nA: You can go in \"Settings\" and under \"Notifications\", you will see in the list \"Spotify\", disable what you don't want (I only kept what relate to \"Lock Screen\" in my case), close that window, exit Spotify and restart it, you should get rid of the anoying track alerts.\n\nA: This blog had the answer for Spotify (this was annoying me for ages):\nhttps://lassekarstensen.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/disable-spotify-song-change-notification-in-debian-linux/\nvi `find ~/.config/spotify/Users/ -name prefs`\n\nadd\nui.track_notifications_enabled=false\n\n", "Q: Creating a KVM on Ubuntu 14.04 host fails I am trying this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/cloud-images-and-uvtool.html\n$ uvt-simplestreams-libvirt sync release=trusty arch=amd64\nbogdanbiv@bivub1404:~$ time uvt-kvm create secondtest release=trusty\n\nreal    0m0.673s\nuser    0m0.127s\nsys     0m0.050s\n\n# although last command takes less than 1 second the next command proves \n# the former actually performed something\nbogdanbiv@bivub1404:~$ uvt-kvm create secondtest release=trusty \nuvt-kvm: error: libvirt: storage volume 'secondtest.qcow' exists already\n\nbogdanbiv@bivub1404:~$ uvt-kvm wait secondttest --insecure\nuvt-kvm: error: libvirt: Domain not found: no domain with matching name 'secondttest'\n\nSo what's wrong here?

Thank you.\n\nA: The word \"screen\" is used in the meaning the X11 system uses, which is not intuitive. Rather than a physical screen, it means the logical abstraction for a single framebuffer. A display can have multiple screens, which can have multiple monitors each. Different monitors can then display different, possibly overlapping portions of the same screen.\nSo rather than \"screen 0\" and \"screen 1\", you want a larger \"screen 0\", with the monitors displaying different portions. You'd set that up with (e.g.)\nxrandr --output DP1 --right-of HDMI1\n\nAfter that, DP1 should report as\nDP1 connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0\n\nYou'd use a setup with multiple \"screen\"s if you have multiple graphics cards, which have separate video memory, because in such a setup, rendering commands need to be distributed over separate GPUs, which has significant complexity, while in your case, it is sufficient to simply generate two different output signals.\n", "Q: Windows install after Ubuntu saw the tutorials on here on how to do this but this is what I've come across.\nboth windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 as of right now work just fine,\nI read I would have to fix grub and all that jazz but nothing of the sort happened \nI put windows on a second hard rive the only problem I'm having is I can only enter windows by hitting F11 at bios ....any fix for that?\n\nA: Try to do a BIOS unlock, you might be able to choose which bootloader is default from each drive. In other words BIOS unlock allows you to set BBS priorities for each drive. Even for multiple OSs in your external USB flash drive should show up. Also you will have to disable Secure Boot permanently if you do the BIOS update as it will break your current GRUB signature and won't let you boot to it. If you install Ubuntu after BIOS update then it might work with Secure Boot \nTIP: You will have to permanently disable Windows Fast Startup since if it is enabled you wont be able to write to any internal disk from within Ubuntu as Windows saves the session to the disk, and Linux will not be able to mount it as R/W. only R/O.\nGRUB still doesn't detect Windows Boot Manager, but maybe you can manually enter it in grub config but I didn't try it. You now have Windows as first priority in RAID BBS priority so you don't have to press F11 to boot to Windows and when you want to boot Ubuntu you press F11 and choose that.

The BIOS loads the bootloader, which is placed so that it can be found easily (either at the beginning of the disk, or in a special partition).\nThe bootloader is an intermediate program that basically just performs the same function as the BIOS -- it loads the next program. Unlike the BIOS, it is specifically made to load Linux, so it knows how to read the Executable and Linking Format (which is used for programs under Linux), and it knows that it should also read the initrd file into memory and pass the address where its contents can be found to the Linux kernel.\nThe kernel itself can typically be found in the /boot directory, with a name of vmlinuz- followed by a version number, and at the moment you can execute commands, a copy of it is somewhere in system memory; the exact address is unpredictable.\n", "Q: remapping k to the right shift button I have been looking on askubuntu for help, but couldn't find the help I needed, so now I just ask.\nMy k key doesn't work, when pressed, and since its a older laptop, i just wish to remap the k key unto the right shift.\nFrom what I have gathered, I need to use xmodmap and xev, but I can't figure out how to remap the k key in question.\n(Copy pasting 'k' is getting very annoying xD )\nHope some of you can help me.

I tried this on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: If an application doesn't require root to install, then the application is in fact \"safer\" (I quoted safer because, in general, an application can still be harmful if you don't know what it does whether you used sudo or not. e.g. Maybe it will sniff around your home directory and start uploading some confidential data, and you wouldn't need root access for that).\nWhat you quoted means that you can unpack the game anywhere you want and start using it directly. Since your home directory is yours, then unpacking in your home directory does not require sudo.\nSince you installed the game without sudo, then that just means the game doesn't need access to any of the system directories (i.e. safer).\n\nA: The game is installed in a directory owned by the user who installs it and runs with privileges from that user. \nFor this method to become to start to be a problem you need to be asked the admin password and \nprovide it. So \n\n\n*\n\n*never run this program with sudo or as root.\n\n*never install this program with sudo or as root.\n\n*when prompted for an admin password post about it on google+ ;)\n\n\nand you'll be fine.\n", "Q: adding fonts to photoshop CS6 run with wine I have photoshop CS6 installed and working on Wine1.7. It's actually surprisingly smooth. The only issue I have now is that the fonts are a bit limited, and I'm not sure if it's an issue with wine or with the photoshop installation. I tried copying some fonts to the ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/Fonts/ directory but they are not appearing in photoshop.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: For those still searching for a solution in '17, you should install to the same wineprefix with wine or playonlinux's run exe in this virtual drive function (configure > Miscellaneous / Run a .exe ...) the program from this site:\nhttp://www.ampsoft.net/utilities/FontViewer.php#Download\n\nA: you should click on the font , then click install and make restart for the program .\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Server 14.04 on a pre-built RAID Array So I've got a RAID array built (Via the ASUS motherboard, 2 disks, RAID 1).\nWhen I try to install Ubuntu server on it, the process runs as normal (Apart from the drive is detected as md126p1 rather than the normal sda or sdb etc).\nBut then on reboot, I just get the little blinking cursor, and nothing happens ...\nHave I missed something here?

Or does everyone think I'm just an idiot Lol?\n", "Q: Preserving GTK theme with gksudo I have a computer with two (non simultaneous) users who are both in the sudo group. Is there a way to preserve the user's GTK theme with gksudo, for instance when running the update manager? By default the Raleigh theme is used.\nI use Lubuntu 14.04 with a simple window manager (Blackbox) and no display manager.\n\nA: I'm not sure why applications launched through gksudo aren't using your user's theme. It works for me on a full Lubuntu system. (But that uses Openbox, not Blackbox.) Fortunately:\n\n*\n\n*The best solution for a program like the Update Manager is probably to install polkit (which is normally present) and run the Update Manager without gksudo. (See Way 1 below.)\n\n*For applications that do have to be started as root, or if you don't want polkit installed, a workaround is to specify the theme you want with GTK_THEME (see Way 2 and Way 3).\n\nWay 1: Install polkit (a.k.a. PolicyKit).\nThe best solution for utilities like:\n\n*\n\n*Software Updater / Update Manager (update-manager)\n\n*Ubuntu Software Center (software-center)\n\n*Lubuntu Software Center (lubuntu-software-center)\n\n*Software & Updates (software-properties-gtk)\n\n...and many of the other system administration utilities in Ubuntu, is to just not run them as root at all.\nNormally you don't need to run these utilities as root because they integrate with polkit and use it (instead of sudo) to perform authentication (just) when neccessary. Since the program showing you the user interface actually runs as you and not as root, it displays in accordance with your user account's configuration.\nTypically nothing special must be done to achieve this, even on a Lubuntu system. Ubuntu is designed so that these utilities can just be run as a non-root user, without any special configuration.\nBut since your system is especially minimal, you probably don't have polkit installed. You can get it by installing the policykit-1  and policykit-1-gnome  packages.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install policykit-1 policykit1-1-gnome\n\nWith polkit installed, these utlities should automatically use it and won't need to be launched as root.\nHowever, this may not be suitable:\n\n*\n\n*if you don't want to install polkit, or\n\n*for running GTK+ programs as root that haven't been written to use polkit (such as Leafpad or Gedit).\n\nWay 2: Set the desired GTK+ theme when you run gksudo.\nSuppose you wish to run gedit as root. Note that this technique works the same way for other GTK+ programs (such as the Update Manager).\nInstead of running gksudo gedit, you can run:\ngksudo env GTK_THEME=HighContrast gedit\nReplace HighContrast with the name of the desired theme.\n(I use env because although sudo supports sudo VARIABLE=name command syntax, gksu/gksudo does not.)\nWay 3: Make a launcher that that sets the desired theme.\nThis is the same as Way 2, just running your program through a launcher rather than typing a command each time.\nTo make a shortcut to run a program (like gedit) with a particular GTK+ theme (like HighContrast) as root in LXDE, run:\nlxshortcut -o ~/Desktop/'gedit (as root)'\nIn place of gedit (as root), put whatever you want as the launcher's display name.\nIn the File Properties window that comes up when you run that command, click the Desktop Entry tab. In the text box labeled command, put:\ngksudo env GTK_THEME=HighContrast gedit\nYou can leave everything else blank and just click OK.\nIf you want, you can use the full paths of the executables being run (/usr/bin/gksudo and, in this example, /usr/bin/gedit.) But this is not generally necessary.\n\nMaking a launcher for gksudo env GTK_THEME HighContrast gedit. (The left part of the command is not visible.)\n\nA: I actually have the same problem as I use i3wm. I suppose since you are using Lubuntu, you should have lxappearance installed. Run that with gksudo, then you should see your theme for gksudo selected. Change and apply that, you should have the theme desired for the gksudo.\n", "Q: Can I reformat a disk partition in order to install Windows alongside Ubuntu? I have a HP Pavailion G6 laptop which came preinstalled with Windows 8, but I tried Ubuntu and fell in love with it. I removed Windows to get more room for Ubuntu. The real problem arose when I needed to get a program developed by our institute which is currently made only for Windows machines. So I made a partition of 150 GB and tried to re-install Windows with a Windows CD. It gave an error that the disk is formatted by someone who doesn't understand GPT partitioning. Now the only option I know is to use diskpart from cmd, which I don't really want to do because I don't have ext HDD big enough to save all necessary data. So is there any way to convert just a disk partition (I do mean disk partition, not the entire disk) to MBR or Windows-supported GPT format?\nEdit:Guys please don't give me suggestions for using VMware or wine.See the comments on first answer for VMware complications and commecnts on second answer for incompatibility with wine.\n\nA: Keep using Ubuntu.\nIf you absolutely need to run a windows program, don't mess around with partitioning, just download VirtualBox, install Windows in that and voilà, not only can you have your cake, you can eat it too.\n\nA: Another alternative to using a virtual machine, is to use a Windows Compatibility Layer, such as Wine.\nThe easiest way to use Wine is to install PlayOnLinux, a graphical frontend for wine, which can manage multiple virtual wine drives. Install it via the software center or sudo apt-get install playonlinux.\nNow, from PlayOnLinux's menu, choose \"Install a program that is not listed\". Follow the instructions and give the installer the link to your Setup.exe, Setup.msi or whatever...\nPS: Even though wine is a great piece of software, it cannot guarantee to run every Windows software on Linux. Some work perfectly, some partially and some not at all. In this case, use a VM.\n\nA: VirtualBox, easy to use and you will get both worlds and even have them interconnected anyway you want. Plus it does not eat too much resources.\nWine may work, but not for all .exe installs, specially with the space limitation you have on you machine. \nbest of luck\n\nA: Have you set your boot order to allow removable drives to be booted from first, then the HDD (Done through bios)\nAlso, when you start up the laptop, during the BIOS post screen (the black screen with all the white writting) hold down F8 until a screen with options comes up, in that list should be your HDD and the USB stick, choose the USB and you should be good to go\nTry that and post back with results\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu (14.04) on external HDD and lost data I've installed Ubuntu on external HDD without formating and lost 800GB from it.

Enjoy (Grub will now give you 2 OS options to load upon boot)\nRegardless of what I said, you can see tons of tutorials on how to do this, either Ubuntu first or Windows first.\nHere is an example of one:\nInstalling Windows 7 on pre-existing Ubuntu 12.04 for Dual-Boot FAQ?\n", "Q: How do I run a script on Unity login/logout? I have two scripts - one to mount some folders over SSHFS - and one to unmount.\nI would like to launch the mount script when my default Ubuntu desktop is launched (after I log in at the graphical console) - and the unmount script when I \"Log Out...\" from the cog-wheel at the top-right of the desktop.\nPlease can someone tell me how to achieve this?  What are the most convenient/standard hooks to run commands on desktop launch / exit?\n\nA: Considering your requirement of running a job when you login to Unity and not for other logins, an Upstart session job seems perfect. \nYou may have noticed it: processes that you run after a GUI login are under a second init process. This init is a proper Upstart init, and you can start and stop session jobs based on events emitted by it. No root privileges needed at all. Better yet (or worse depending on the perspective), this is not yet completely supported for headless systems. An SSH login didn't start the user init from a quick test that I made just now.\nTo create a session job, make a new .conf file in ~/.config/upstart. That's the default primary directory for Upstart session jobs ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/upstart), create it if doesn't exist. Here's an example job:\ntee ~/.config/upstart/myjob.conf <<EOF\ndescription \"My job\"\nstart on desktop-start\nstop on desktop-end\n\nscript \n       firefox 'http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#session-job'\nend script\nEOF\n\nYou can manually control it:\nstart myjob \n# or\ninitctl start myjob\n\nThe service command are used to control system jobs (those in /etc/init.d or /etc/init). For controlling session jobs, one needs to use the initctl command, which is used to interact with Upstart.\nSee man upstart-events for more events you can use.\n\nA: The solution was to use upstart tasks. I required two tasks - one fired when the desktop initializes for a user; the second when the users session expires. The following two scripts work for me under Ubuntu 14.04.\nIn ~/.config/upstart/desktopOpen.conf\ndescription \"Desktop Open Task\"\nstart on desktop-start\ntask\nscript\n# Commands to mount sshfs go here as shell-script.\nend script\n\nIn ~/.config/upstart/desktopClose.conf\ndescription \"Desktop Close Task\"\nstart on session-end\ntask\nscript\n# Commands to unmount sshfs go here as shell-script.\nend script\n\nMy fingers are crossed that these events will continue to meet requirements in future Ubuntu releases. I thought it worth posting my solution here - in case it is of use to others.\n\nA: Here are some suggestions for running a script after login:\nStackOverflow Linux script after bootup: Cliff notes is to put your *.sh file in /etc/profile.d.\nIf you want to run scripts upon bootup, here are some suggestions for that:\nStackOverflow Linux script after boot: Cliff notes is to use /etc/rc.local or crontab.\n", "Q: Sharing folders in NTFS partitions in a network with SMB I have a computer on my office with Ubuntu 14.04 and a laptop with the same configuration.

But when I try to open it, I get an error: \"Unable to mount Window Share: Permission Denied\".\nWhat have I missed?\nUPDATE: My folder is in a NTFS partition. Is that a problem?\n\nA: There could be several reasons that it's not working, but rather than troubleshoot the \"simpler\" method, it would probably be much easier (and much more secure) to share it only with yourself, unless you need to share it with others, in which case they would need a login on the system, and the folder would need to allow access by them.\nIf you only share it with known users, then you will need to give the user name and password the first time, but it should remember in the future (assuming you tell it to).

Mine looks like this:\n[...]\nindex: 8\n    name: <alsa_card.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00-Headset>\n    driver: <module-alsa-card.c>\n    owner module: 27\n    properties:\n            alsa.card = \"1\"\n            alsa.card_name = \"Logitech USB Headset\"\n            [... more output ...]\n[...]\n\nFrom your output, look up the line \"owner module\". That is the module you need to unload, but you will need to look at it's parameters first, so you can reload it. Enter command\npacmd list-modules\n\nand locate the module driving your card. Again, the relevant part of the output in my case looks like this (index matches owner module from output of pacmd list-cards):\n[...]\nindex: 27\n    name: <module-alsa-card>\n    argument: <device_id=\"1\" name=\"usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00-Headset\" card_name=\"alsa_card.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00-Headset\" namereg_fail=false tsched=yes fixed_latency_range=no ignore_dB=no deferred_volume=yes use_ucm=yes card_properties=\"module-udev-detect.discovered=1\">\n    used: 2\n    load once: no\n    properties:\n    [... more output ...]\n[...]\n\nYou will need the module name and arguments to reload it.\nTo unload the module, enter command (replace module-index with appropriate value from your output)\npacmd unload-module module-index\n\nTo reload the module after it's unloaded, enter command\npacmd load-module module-name module-arguments\n\nReplace module-name and module-arguments with values from output of pacmd list-modules. Leave out the angle brackets.\nNow the module should be reloaded, and with some luck your headset profiles are back.\nApplying automation\nThe above steps are a lot of work if you need to reset your device often, as the module index keeps changing and you need to look it up every time. I wrote a shell script for myself to automate the worst of it:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n  echo \"Pulseaudio has these cards:\"\n  pacmd list-cards | grep 'name: '\n  exit 0\nfi\n\nMODULE_INDEX=`pacmd list-modules | tac | grep -A 10 -e \"argument: .*$1\" | grep 'index:' | head -n 1 | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d ' '`\nMODULE_NAME=`pacmd list-modules | tac | grep -A 10 -e \"argument: .*$1\" | grep 'name:' | head -n 1 | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d '<>'`\nMODULE_ARGUMENTS=`pacmd list-modules | tac | grep -e \"argument: .*$1\" | head -n 1 | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d '<>'`\necho \"Module index is $MODULE_INDEX\"\necho \"Module name: $MODULE_NAME\"\necho \"Module args: $MODULE_ARGUMENTS\"\n\nif [ -z \"$MODULE_INDEX\" ]; then echo \"Could not find module index\"; exit 0; fi\nif [ -z \"$MODULE_NAME\" ]; then echo \"Could not find module name\"; exit 0; fi\nif [ -z \"$MODULE_ARGUMENTS\" ]; then echo \"Could not find module arguments\"; exit 0; fi\n\necho \"Unloading module\"\npacmd unload-module $MODULE_INDEX\necho \"\"\necho \"Reloading module\"\npacmd load-module $MODULE_NAME $MODULE_ARGUMENTS\necho \"\"\n\nWhen run without arguments, the script lists the cards Pulseaudio knows of. When a part of a card's name is given as argument, the script attempts to unload and reload the relevant Pulseaudio module.\n", "Q: install windows 7 and ubuntu on the same partition i was wondering if i could install windows 7 and Ubuntu on the same hard drive partition.. when i select \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows \" it creates another partition to install Ubuntu int... but what i want is to install Ubuntu in the same partition as that of windows..\nafter searching he whole internet i'm starting to think that it's not possible as there will be a confliction between windows and Ubuntu boot-loader... but i'm not sure about that..\nthere is this post here but it doesn't fit to my situation.. thanks!\n\nA: A boot entry is registered in the MBR for a partition.

It appears that your init file is missing or corrupt. There are two ways to solve this problem:\nOption 1\n\nYou can simply re-install Ubuntu. This is the simplest and most reliable method of solving this problem. It also always works.\nIf you want to save your data, use a LiveCD in \"Trial\" mode and copy all important stuff to a\nUSB drive. You can then install directly from the drive.\n\nOption 2\n\nIt is theoretically possible to pull a working init executable from a working installation and putting that in your /sbin folder. This, however, is rather complicated. You can try doing this:\n\n*\n\n*Mount the install drive to the /mnt folder\n\n*As root, copy the init file from /sbin/init to /mnt/sbin/init.\n\n*Verify and copy the permissions from the working install to the bad install.\n\n*Test by rebooting.\n\nYou should only do this on functionally identical installs. Meaning, don't use a livecd. Instead, use a spare hard drive.\n\nPull out the current laptop hard drive and put it in an external caddy. Put the clean drive into the laptop and install Ubuntu. Then, mount and copy.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible for Ubuntu to work with MTK6572 Dual Core ARM Cortex A7 family CPU@1.2GHz processor in a tablet?

Check out gparted and see what you see on the top right (sudo apt-get install gparted if you don't have it installed and you booted into a debian/ubuntu based distro)\n\n3) Now that you know which is which (Make sure you do!) run the following command. For the purpose of this command I'll assume that your smaller SSD is /dev/sdb while the larger is /dev/sdc\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc bs=4M\n\n4) This will take a while, a long while. Once it's done, open up gparted and you'll notice that the there's a 256 GB portion that should match your other 256 GB with 256 GB free at the end. Simply extend your main partition into the unallocated space at the end and you should be good to go.\nI'm not sure that this will work properly with the encryption + LVM, but I don't see any glaring reasons why not.\n", "Q: Can't find pvr addons in XBMC I just upgraded my pc from xbmcbuntu 12.2 Frodo to xubuntu 14.04 and installed xbmc 13.1 Gotham on it.

Any suggestions?\nUPDATE: I'm now suspecting that either the DHCP client or the Azure Linux Agent is messing with the hostname.\n\nA: I guess I'm a little late to the party but in Ubuntu the Ubuntu Cloud packages appear to be responsible for this. This answer should still be relevant since it is applicable to 18.04 LTS.\nThe configuration data for these packages appears to be in /var/lib/cloud/data, the /var/lib/cloud/data/set-hostname file in particular:\n{\n \"fqdn\": \"<your fqdn>\",\n \"hostname\": \"<your hostname>\"\n}\n\nAs far as I can tell the hostname is set by the configuration scripts from these packages at boot time.\n\nA: It's probably a script running in the background.\nYou have 2 options:\n1) Remove whatever is changing your hostname.\n2) Change your hostname in /etc/hostname and run sudo chattr +i /etc/hostname to prevent it from being changed.\n\nA: I was experiencing the same issue in Ubuntu 22.04 server which I installed from the cloud image. For me it was cloud-init constantly resetting the hostname because I had set the hostname when creating the cloud-init config file for installing the VM.\nIn the end, all I had to do was disable cloud-init from running by creating an empty file at a specific location:\nsudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled\n\nI can do this because I set up my own guest within my own KVM host. If one is using a cloud provider, this may not be a viable solution for you as you may need cloud-init to keep running those startup steps.\nI had no idea before now that cloud-init didn't just run on first setup until reading this other Ask Ubuntu post, but will run a different set of steps afterwards. For more info, here are the cloud-init boot stage docs.\n\nA: Went through the same scenario and issue.  Removing the cloud-init, cloud-init-utils, and walinuxagent packages cleared the issue.\nsudo apt-get remove cloud-init\nsudo apt-get remove cloud-init-utils\nsudo apt-get remove walinuxagent\n\nAbove package names may not be accurate, and removal of dependent packages and/or configs may be called for as well.

A couple of days ago I checked for updates and version 13 was available to upgrade so I selected update.  After it started and asked for root login, I left it to do something else.  I forgot about it, and my daughter unplugged it, and it may not have finished updating before it died.  Now it is not working properly.  It seemed fine at first, but it is not detecting the wifi chip, the setting screen opens but is blank, and it no longer asks for a password when it boots. Can I try to install version 13 again or should I go back to 12.04?\n\nA: You can try running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and see if it continues the upgrade from where it left off if you can get to a terminal. Since you have no wifi see if you can find ethernet.\n\nA: BACKGROUND:\nFor the HP Mini 110 or 210 series there are various issues (with 12.10, 13.04, or 13.10) with the graphics chipset and quality of the drivers available.\nI no longer have a 110 series (I assume you have a 110-1030NR) to test, but the 210 series works well with 14.04 LTS (32-bit).\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nIf you have your data backed up, you should proceed with a new install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (32-bit). You would also be greatly advantaged by upgrading to 2GB RAM.\nNOTE: If you still need to recover your data, do that first. Do NOT attempt to fix the OS, until you have a backup of all your data.\n", "Q: How do I stop skype from auto-launching I have Ubuntu 14.04 with Cinnamon. When I log in, Skype autolaunches and I want to stop that.\nI looked in Startup Applications but cannot find it.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04 with Skype version 8.73, there is option in the settings to disable autostart. Just go Settings -> General -> \"Automatically start Skype\".\n\n\nA: As Stunts mentioned skypeforlinux recreates autostarting shortcut ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop. So, removing this file doesn't have any sense. But we can disable autostarting with two steps:\n\n*\n\n*open ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop with your favorite text editor and set X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled to false (as KB5 says). Here is my skypeforlinux.desktop:\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Skype for Linux\nComment=Skype Internet Telephony\nExec=/usr/bin/skypeforlinux\nIcon=skypeforlinux\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false\n\n\n\n*deny overwriting the skypeforlinux.desktop to prevent changing it by skypeforlinux:\n\nchmod a-w ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\n\n\nA: Try running the following command:\nrm .config/autostart/skype.desktop\n\nIt should remove it from starting automatically. You will also need to change the settings in skype, otherwise each time you open it, it is set to open automatically.\n\nA: You can disable the autostart for Skype by setting changing following value to false in~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop file\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false\n\n\nA: Had the same issue on Ubuntu 17.10 and fixed it with the following command:\nrm ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\n\nAnd as Tim mentions here, disable autostart in the Skype settings because Skype will keep on adding the skypeforlinux.desktop file to the ~/.config/autostart directory.\n[*] I know the question is about Ubuntu 14.04 but I came across this page while searching for a solution for Ubuntu 17\n\nA: If you installed Skype via Snap the paths (as of Ubuntu 20.04) are:\n~/snap/skype/current/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\n~/snap/skype/common/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\n\nI found @alokym's solution quite good. Don't forget his second step, though.\n\nA: Since skypeforlinux will now atomatically recreate the file ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop every time it is started, we now need another way to prevent that.\nHere is what worked on my case:\nrm ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\nmkdir ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\n\nWhat will this do? The first command will remove the auto-created .desktop file that makes skypeforlinux autostart on session startup.\nThe second command will create a directory what skypeforlinux normally creates its autostart file. This will prevent skypeforlinux from being able to create the autostart file.\nYes, it is kind of dirty and you are left with an empty directory in ~/.config/autostart, but it does get the job done.\n\nA: I had the same problem and this solved it for me:\nFirst run the following command:\nrm ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\n\nThen open Skype and go to Tools, Settings. Go to General and disable \"Automatically start Skype\". You can also disable \"Launch Skype in the backgound\" if you want to.\n\nA: Replace auto-start-enable true to false:\nfile1=~/snap/skype/current/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop\nsed -i '$ d' $file1 # remove last line\necho \"X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false\" >> $file1\ncat $file1\n\nThe cat may output (notice last line):\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Skype for Linux\nComment=Skype Internet Telephony\nExec=/snap/bin/skype\nIcon=skypeforlinux\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false\n\n\nA: This will not help (at least not in my Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) because skype automatically activates itself in the Startup Applications every time it is used. You can stop starting skype by adding a command that will kill skype on startup after skype has started itself: \nIn the Unity Dash, type: \nstartup \nand click (under Applications) on \"Startup Applications\" (this will open \"Startup Application Preferences\". \nClick on \"Add\" and type under Name: \nz-kill skype\n(the \"z\" at the beginning will make sure that it is further down in the list of applications than skype, and thus starts /after/ skype has started) \nand type under Command: \nkillall -9 skypeforlinux \n(this will kill \"skypeforlinux\" -- if your skype program has a different name in a different linux version, you have to type in that name) \nGood luck! And enjoy your linux without skype imposing on startup ;-) \n\nA: I found an easy way. Just go to Settings in Skype and switch off autostart and something like Κeep Skype ρunning. Skype deleted the ~/.config/autostart file.\n\nA: Combining the answers from @alokym and @intosomething with a one-liner that works for my snap-installation on (k)ubuntu 22.04:\n[ -f ~/snap/skype/current/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop ] && FILE=~/snap/skype/current/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop || FILE=~/snap/skype/common/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop; echo \"$(cat $FILE | sed 's/X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true/X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false/g')\" > $FILE && chmod a-w $FILE\n\n\nA: create a skypestop.sh file and make it executable. put this in:\nsudo chmod 444 /usr/share/skypeforlinux/skypeforlinux\nto start skype create a start file like skypestart.sh:\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/share/skypeforlinux/skypeforlinux\nskypeforlinux\nwhen u finish using it run skypestop.sh and that is it\nif your skype software is upgrades run skypestop.sh again as the upgrade overwrites the attributes.\n", "Q: Why won't Vim source my .vimrc at startup? Note:  edited to provide more info.\nI have modified my ~/.vimrc significantly (although some of my initial modifications I made in the system-wide /etc/vim/vimrc).  It probably doesn't matter either way since I am really the only user on my laptop, and certainly the only one who edits in Vim.\nAnyway, with the Vim-LaTeX package, files open with folds automatically inserted at sections and subsections of .tex documents.  This is fine (and useful once in a while) as long as the folds are all open when I start.  The following two lines seem to accomplish what I want when the .vimrc is sourced!\nset foldmethod=syntax\nautocmd Syntax tex normal zR\n\nMy frustrating workaround has been to manually source .vimrc when I open a document to begin editing (or at least invoking zR manually to open all the folds).\n\nMy cascading question is:\nIs there an environmental variable that I can set (in my .bash_profile, say) that tells Vim to look for .vimrc in my home directory?  Shouldn't this be the default?  How do I fix this?\n\nEDIT:  I haven't been able to resolve this.  I've included the verbose output of vim -V.  It looks as if my ~/.vimrc is being sourced, but then perhaps other stuff is \"overwriting\" it in memory?\nchdir(/home/sammy)\nfchdir() to previous dir\nsourcing \"/home/sammy/.vimrc\"\nSearching for

Good luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04: No longer connecting to wired connection I recently upgraded my system from 12.04 to 14.04 and everything was working fine.  However, one day it randomly stopped connecting to the wired connection.  My wireless connection works fine, but if I disable wireless and attempt to connect to the wired, it keeps attempting to obtain an ip address without avail.  When I run ifconfig, it shows no ip address for eth0.  Any ideas on how to fix it?\n\nA: So for anyone using a \"wired\" connection that won't connect.  I just happened upon what seems to be a solution to my particular problem.  All i did was go to edit connections and add a new Ethernet connection and boom!  It worked fantastically.  At least for now...\n", "Q: Can't install ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop When i tried to install every time it show the message \nGeneral error mounting filesystems. \nA maintenance shell will be started. \nControl -D will terminate this shell and reboot the system. \nRoot@ubuntu:~#\n\nI'm trying to dual boot with Windows 7.  I used wubi, xboot, usb installer for installing. Everytime i got this. PC is an HP Probook 440 g1 i5.\n\nA: It sounds like you have tried quite a few things without success to get this dual boot working. I had a similar experience with my laptop so I ended up getting virtualbox for windows and installing linux on that. If your school has VMware licenses that is an even better virtualization product. Sometimes the virtual machine can be more convenient than a dual boot as well since you can run it within the context of windows 7. Just an alternate suggestion that may help you get 14.04 on your laptop. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Wubi is no longer supported by Canonical.  Take a look at the Forums Recommendations1\nThere are still other ways to dual boot not using wubi, from a virtual machine as previously mentioned, to installing on a USB, or even just running the live media with persistence.\n", "Q: Add a startup application in the background in UbuntuGNOME 14.04 I want transmission to startup when I login but would rather the window not pop up, I just want it to start minimized with it's app indicator.

Thanks in advance\n\nA: You can start your Transmission after in background in two ways, either starting  transmission-gtk in minimized mode or using transmission-daemon\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to start transmission window in background with its app\nindicator add following command in the Startup Applications\ntransmission-gtk --minimized\n\n*If you do not want to start transmission window but start your\ndownload when your computer starts, you can use transmission-daemon.\nInstall it using sudo apt-get install transmission-daemon.\nIt will start automatically when your computer starts.\nTo stop it you can use\n/etc/init.d/transmission-daemon stop\n", "Q: How can I make Sublime Text 3 run as root from Unity? I know I am not root because I cannot browse packages.\nFirst, I am aware of this page, but it is not working for me.  After following those instruction, I get the prompt when I open Sublime from Unity, but I am still not able to browse packages. If I open sublime using gksu subl in the terminal, nothing happens.  If I do sudo subl it opens and I can browse packages.  Is it OK to open sublime as sudo every time instead of gksu?\nEdit: Actually, when I open sublime from Unity, it prompts for the password, then doesn't open at all.\nEdit: gksudo subl has the same effect as gksu.  I installed Sublime from the website (clicked the Ubuntu 64 link, it downloaded, clicked the download, it took me to Software Center).  \"which subl\" returns /usr/bin/subl. gksu is installed.  Glutanimate, yes that is what I mean.  Any idea what is happening then?

(or sudo -i ...) instead of just sudo ....\nsudo -H subl\n\nsudo -i subl\n(Neither plain sudo ... nor those ways will typically work from the Unity dash, because they need a terminal on which to prompt you for your password. But you can run them from the Terminal.)\nThe main reason it's considered bad to run a graphical program with normal sudo is that this runs the application with its HOME environment variable set to non-root caller's home directory (/home/username) rather than root's home directory (/root). That often causes configuration files that should belong to the regular user, to belong to root instead (and inaccessible).\nRunning sudo with the -H flag prevents this by making sure root's home directory is used instead.\nsudo -i does this and more: it runs a program in a simulated root login session. I'm not aware of any strong reasons to prefer one or the other of sudo -H and sudo -i, when the goal is just to run graphical programs as root without problems.\n", "Q: Changing environment variables I just changed my /etc/environment file to: \nM2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.1.1\nM2=$M2_HOME/bin\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\nPATH=$M2:$PATH\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.6.0_45\nPATH=$JAVA_HOME:$PATH\n\n(trying to do something similar to this)\nHowever, when I tried checking the environment variables by typing, for instance echo \"$M2\", the result is an empty line for all the variables and $PATH is the same as before editing the file. Why didn't my changes operate? I tried closing and opening the shell, but nothing happens.\n\nA: /etc/environment takes a proper re-login to take effect, because it is processed by PAM at login. Further, as @przemo noted, it is not run or sourced as a script, so variables are not expanded. Put such variables in a .sh file in /etc/profile.d/:\nsudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/my_vars.sh <<\"EOF\"\nexport M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.1.1\nexport M2=$M2_HOME/bin\nexport PATH=$M2:$PATH\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.6.0_45\nexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME:$PATH\nEOF\n\nThis will also take a re-login to take full effect, but you can test it out immediately by running a login shell:\n$ bash -l\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/jdk1.6.0_45:/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.1.1/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\nAs Gunnar has pointed out, the default assignment to PATH should remain in /etc/environment, and shouldn't be added to the above script. See this community wiki page for more information.\n\nA: /etc/environment is not a script file, you cannot use variables, for further reading I recommend https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables\n", "Q: Wine systray not working on Unity Ubuntu 14.04 The problem is that the wine systray is not working in my Unity desktop on Ubuntu 14.04.\nAny other app for Ubuntu (Skype, Steam-ubuntu version, Transmission) works fine, just the Wine systray is not appearing.\nI reset Unity, reinstalled it, reinstalled wine and I can't make it work.\n\nA: Wine (Windows) System Tray does not work in Ubuntu.

It is advised to check there for power management settings.\nWhen you reboot your PC, try hitting F10. One of these keys will enter BIOS settings. Then, try to navigate to the power management tab. Make sure all settings are disabled.\nYou also need to go into the power management control panel and disable screen timeout and all button actions.\nIf this doesn't work, your BIOS is simply not allowing this to happen. It also might be the kernel or your ACPI power management module.\n\nA: Configure your power settings something like this:\nopen terminal and type unity-control-center power to open \"Power\" settings\nOr go to System Settings and find there Power\n \n", "Q: Why is my CPU Frequency stuck? After recent routine upgrades, I've noticed that I'm unable to change my CPU frequency manually.

But I just did another update, and sync is working again suddenly. I don't know if it's part of your problem, but force an update today if you can. \nHere are my checks and steps to sync. Maybe something here will help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask root to add you to the dialout group. Then you need to logout and log in again. As a normal user, type this command to see what groups you belong to:\ngroups\n\n*Make sure visor is loaded. You can check as non-root by typing this in the terminal:\nmodprobe visor 2>/dev/null ; echo $?  # you want to see a \"0\"\n\n\n*Check to see if pilot-link package is present. as non-root do:\ntest -e /usr/bin/pilot-xfer ; echo $?  # again, you want to see a \"0\"\n\n\n*Attach the device via USB. I usually plug it in, unplug it, then plug it right back in a second time and conform a beep (Zire 72). The next command has to happen within 80 seconds:\npilot-xfer --port usb: --list #connect and list databases, mostly harmless \n\nHere you are using pilot-link (which jpilot uses too) to list your databases. You will need to hit the hotsync button on your device too. \nIf all of that worked, then the issue probably is going to be jpilot configuration. \n", "Q: can't upgrade to 14.04 resolve generate blanks I have spent hours trying to upgrade, reading the forum, trying solutions but unable to get really anywhere.

Why isn't printing the numbers?\n\nA: SH is stupid. It can not do anything.\nIt only knows the most basic commands. It does not do anything else.\nIt can not understand {1..99} as a numeric value. It understands it as a string. \nSH/Dash is not developed. It is meant to be an emergency prompt for DIRE circumstances (in interactive mode. Otherwise, it's a really good thing for scripting.).\nBash is recommended as it can do everything SH can, as well as the newest in customization and powerful features.\nIn answer to #1, the #! is only parsed if the program is called directly. (as in, ./program.sh)\n\nA: sh, the Bourne shell, is old. Its behaviour is specified by the POSIX standard. If you want new behaviour, you use bash, the Bourne Again shell, which gets new features added to it all the time. On many systems, sh is just bash, and bash turns on a compatibility mode when run under that name. On Ubuntu, sh is dash, the Debian Almquist shell.\nThe brace expansion is a relatively new feature, and would not be available in older bashes as well. It certainly shouldn't be in sh.\nThe shebang line is only respected if you call the script as an executable:\n./myscript.sh\n\nI can give a script any shebang and still have it open in Python by running:\npython myscript.sh\n\nSee these excellent questions on Unix & Linux: \n\n\n*\n\n*Does the shebang determine the shell which runs the script?\n\n*Different ways to execute a shell script\n", "Q: Ubuntu and Ipods 2014 I have an ipod shuffle and I want to copy mp3 into it.\nHow hard is it to do on Ubuntu ?

This second step is quite tough, here are the instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Getting Winetricks (Note: Winetricks is also available from Ubuntu repository):\nwget http://winetricks.org/winetricks\nchmod +x winetricks\n\n*Open Winetricks:\n./winetricks\n\n*An Interface is prompted select the default profile\n\n*Select \"Install a Windows DLL or component\"; click OK\n\n*Select vcrun2008S; click OK\n\n*Follow the installation instructions.\n\n\n\nLINE INSTALLATION\nSTEP 1 : Open a Terminal and create a new temporal directory and move to it: \nmkdir line_tmp\ncd line_tmp\n\nSTEP 2 : Get the last Line software version from the official website:\nwget http://dl.desktop.line.naver.jp/naver/LINE/win/LineInst.exe\n7z x -y LineInst.exe\n\nSTEP 3: Procced with the installation as state on this website:\n inode1=$(ls -ilab | awk 'FNR == 4 {print $1}')\n inode2=$(ls -ilab | awk 'FNR == 6 {print $1}')\n find . -inum $inode1 -exec mv {} LINE \\;\n find . -inum $inode2 -exec mv {} resources \\;\n mv ./resources/res ./LINE\n mv ./LINE ../\n cd ..\n rm -R line_tmp\n\nSTEP 4: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your home folder\n\n*there is a folder named Line and inside the Line.exe file\n\n*Open this file with wine.\n\nA: The easiest solution is to install Chromium (or Google Chrome), and run LINE on top of it.\n\n*\n\n*Install Chromium for the Ubuntu repository\n\n*Run Chromium\n\n*Within Chromium, go to http://line.me click on \"Download\" then click on \"Chrome\"\n\n*Click \"Install\"\n\n*The LINE app should start, asking you to enter your password\n\nLINE running on my Ubuntu via Chromium:\n\nPlease note that the Chrome LINE app is quite basic:\n\n*\n\n*As @Kasun points out, it does not support video calls. Actually it does not seem to support normal calls either.\n\n*As @jeffmcneill points out, there are no threaded discussions, no calls, no multiple windows, and there are issues with animated stickers.\n\n", "Q: How to use USB bluetooth dongle/internal bluetooth chip on a virtual windows xp machine on ubuntu 14.04 I am able to use my internal bluetooth chip on Ubuntu (obvious).

I also tried to do it with R without success \n\nA: One of the functions allowing to combine tables and lists in LibreOffice is Vlookup - vertical lookup. What it does is to take a value, like the number 6 in your list, search in the first column of the table and return one of the values from the corresponding rows in the table.\nThus Vlookup definition includes:\n- the text or value to search for (single value)\n- the range of cells (table) where to search that value - the function only looks into the first column of that range\n- the number of the column desired as a result\n- a logical value that defines if the original table is sorted (best left to 0)\nThe range of cells containing the table should be defined through absolute references (using the \"$\" sign in front of the cell references). As an example, I have used the same formula on columns F, G and H, but changed the recovered column number:\n\nR gives a lot more flexibility and speed for the same operations but on short lists and with the data at hand Vlookup is pretty powerful. In R, merge.data.frame is one of the functions that can be used for combining tables (data frames) by using a given column. If the table is in a data frame called tb and the list is another data frame called ids, merging the two would be done by:\n>merged <- merge.data.frame(ids, tb, by.x=\"id\", by.y=\"Id\", sort=F)\n> merged\nid Name Age Affiliate\n1  2    Y  33        DD\n2  3    G  46        SS\n3  5    W  80        CE\n\nThe names of the columns used to merge the tables are \"id\" and \"Id\".\n", "Q: PDF Presenter Console is installed but invisible in Dash I just installed PDF Presenter Console via the Ubuntu Software Center.

GParted on my live disk sees the drive as being \"2 TiB\"... It is clearly labelled as 1 TB on the outside.\nI started a low level reformat using dd but it is progressing at about 290 Kbps. It is going to take approximately 55 days to format this drive at that rate. Not exactly acceptable. Can I abort this and try some other method?\nThe drive is connected via USB 2.0 and dd is running off of a live disk. Can I abort the operation without harming the hard drive? There is no data on the drive, I want to make it usable.\n\nA: Yes, you can abort dd.\nJust go to the terminal where dd is running and press Ctrl+C.\nAborting dd will not roll things back to the way they were before dd started writing a stream of data to the disk. But that's fine, because you don't need that.\nIf your goal is just to clear out all the partitions on the disk and make a new partition table, you can do this in any partitioning utility. It's fast, because it doesn't write over most of the disk. Data might still be recoverable, but old files won't pop up out of nowhere or anything of the sort.\n(And if you do need to securely erase the disk, dd might not be adequate for that.)\nWriting a new partition table to the disk is traditionally what people mean when they say \"low level format.\" Actually there's something else called that too, which is typically not possible through software, and which also doesn't involve writing data all over the disk. (Modern hard disks contain some data structures used internally by the drive firmware.) dd will not write in those \"low level\" areas.\n\nAs for the problem that motivated you to run dd on the drive in the first place, if creating a new partition table in GParted or other utilities doesn't fix it and make the disk's size appear correctly, I suspect dd wouldn't improve on that situation either.\nThere might be something (physically) wrong with the drive, but I wonder if maybe you've come up against some strange bug in GParted (or the version of GParted you're using) instead. Do things work any differently with fdisk? (fdisk is not nearly as powerful as parted or gparted, but you don't need to move or resize any partitions, so it should be adequate to the task.)\nIf you haven't done so, I also recommend checking the drive for failure indicators and defects. Assuming it supports SMART (most drives these days do), you can use smartctl (see also this guide). You can scan the drive for surface defects with badblocks, though given how long dd was taking to run, that might take a long time.\n\nA: Test gdisk.\nIt is available in Ubuntu Trusty Tahr 14.04.1 Live Iso.\nOpen a terminal.\nExecute:\nsudo su \ngdisk /dev/sd?\n\nThe gdisk program employs a user interface similar to that of Linux's fdisk, but gdisk modifies GPT partitions. It also has the capability of transforming MBR partitions or BSD disklabels into GPT partitions. Like the original fdisk program, gdisk does not modify disk structures until you explicitly write them to disk, so if you make a mistake, you can exit from the program with the q option to leave your partitions unmodified.\nWhen creating a fresh partition table, certain considerations may be in order:\n\n*\n\n*For data disks, and for boot disks used on BIOS-based computers with GRUB as the boot loader, partitions may be created in whatever order and in whatever sizes are desired.\n\n\n*Boot disks for EFI-based systems require an EFI System Partition (gdisk internal code 0xEF00) formatted as FAT-32.\n\n\n*Some boot loaders for BIOS-based systems make use of a BIOS Boot Partition (gdisk internal code 0xEF02), in which the secondary boot loader is stored, possibly without the benefit of a filesystem.\n\n\n*If Windows is to boot from a GPT disk, a partition of type Microsoft Reserved (gdisk internal code 0x0C01) is recommended. This partition should be about 128 MiB in size. It ordinarily follows the EFI System Partition and immediately precedes the Windows data partitions.\n\n\n*Some OSes' GPT utilities create some blank space (typically 128 MiB) after each partition. The intent is to enable future disk utilities to use this space. Such free space is not required of GPT disks, but creating it may help in future disk maintenance.\nOptions:\n-l List the partition table for the specified device and then exits. \n\nb Save partition data to a backup file.\n\nc Change the GPT name of a partition. \n\nd Delete a partition.\n\ni Show detailed partition information.\n\nl Display a summary of partition types.\n\nn Create a new partition.\n\no Clear out all partition data.\n\np Display basic partition summary data. \n\nq Quit from the program without saving your changes.\n\nr Enter the recovery & transformation menu.\n\ns Sort partition entries.\n\nt Change a single partition's type code.\n\nv Verify disk.\n\nw Write data.\n\n?

I have recently upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 and xserver broke during the process. I have tried reinstalling from the command line running the following:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get -y install xserver-xorg\nsudo apt-get -y install x11-xserver-utils\nsudo apt-get install xorg openbox\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core\nsudo apt-get install xorg\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nNone of the above fixed x. I've also tried \"upgrading\" from a live DVD. I could not find an upgrade option, however. Most options implied erasing current partitions and one a side-by-side installation with previous ones. Now I'm thinking about restoring the xorg files from the live installation on the previous(already upgraded 14.04) installation. How should I approach this issue?  \n\nA: I think that the easiest way to do this is to simply to, yes, re-install.\nYou might also get away by purgeing the Xorg packages. To do this, you need to find out all of the installed X11 server packages and run:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove <X11 packages>\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nNote that this may remove all configs for X11, GNOME, and potentially many other packages. It is VERY DANGEROUS. I do not take responsibility if you break your computer.\nYou might also have luck deleting the X11 configs. I think most of them are housed in /etc/X11, but there may be more scattered around.\n", "Q: Chromium freezes after resuming from standby (Kubuntu 14.04) Every time my laptop resumes from standby the Chromium browser becomes frozen.

The problem is because freetype, the font rendering engine works differently trying to render Windows type fonts correctly (This is more of a horrible job in Microsoft than on Linux) by taking into account the embedded bitmaps these fonts have inside by default.

[I do not mean mving the files, I mean deleting ONLY the folder the files are in, but not the files.\nIn general, how do inodes even work?\n\nA: As @hakermania said it has to be written somewhere, so it takes space.\nPlus ext4 has jurnal, so additional information is written and you don't know were data is physically on hard drive (in opposite to ext2) so even shred doesn't work. \nIt is possible to restore any file deleted on ext4, but they are deleted if you delete the forlder (they need to be somewhere).\nAs for inodes and more information on folderd, it's explained very well in this article:\nhttps://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout\nso copying it has no sense.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 LTS Won't Boot w/Monitor Connected I installed Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 LTS on a Lenovo RD540 server.  Actually two of them.  Both servers experience same behavior.  \n1) Server stalls during bootup.  \n2) The most recent message during boot is \"mei 0000:00:16.0: initialization failed\".  \n3) Bootup stalls ONLY if monitor is connected.  If I disconnect the VGA cable and boot, then connect monitor after I've given it time to boot up, I'm at the login prompt and there is no issue.  If I leave monitor connected it always stalls during boot.\nI tried blacklisting mei thinking it was the problem given the error message that always shows when it stalls.  I followed the instructions here: http://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Resolve_mei:_Init_hw_failure_or_mei:_initialization_failed\nNote the instructions didn't work correctly.  I actually had to do the command \"blacklist mei_me\" to get MEI to blacklist.  \"blacklist mei\" didn't do anything.  After blacklisting MEI the problem still exists, the only difference is that the error message (#2) is gone.  But instead the boot still stalls, but there is no discernable error causing the stall.  My current theory is that this issue has nothing to do with MEI and is maybe graphics related?  But I'm really perplexed.  It's a server, terminal only.  Not loading a window manager.  Only stalls on boot if monitor is connected.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I solved the issue, it was graphics related.\nI made the following change to /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset\"\n", "Q: Tap to click - short mouse movements registering as a click I'm on Ubuntu 14.04, on a Lenovo y410p Ideapad, and I'm having an issue where my mouse movements are registering as a tap even when I've actually moved my cursor. For instance, maybe I have the cursor 100 pixels away from something and I move the cursor quickly to the target. When I lift my finger, Ubuntu thinks I've clicked.  \nI'm guessing there's a time thresh hold for how long the touchpad can be engaged, and if the movement is less than that amount of time it registers as a click? If so, I'd like to shorten this thresh hold. But maybe it doesn't work like that?\nIt's really annoying, since any small movement of the mouse usually results in a click, often closing tabs or windows unintentionally.\n\nA: Maybe this also helps here:\nEdit the file \n/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf \n\nAnd edit the \"touchpad catchall\" section, so it will look like this:\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifier \"touchpad catchall\"\nDriver \"synaptics\"\nMatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n# This option is recommend on all Linux systems using evdev, but cannot be\n# enabled by default.

(sometimes , there is an additional  \"mic  \"  capture switch  : must be in \"capture \" state)\n\n\nSome of these settings can also be done with Pavucontrol  but not all:\nIn pavucontrol \"input device \" tab, select correct sound card (not hdmi) and  input (mic)\n", "Q: VirtualHosts not working properly I am running Ubuntu Gnome 14.04, I apt-get installed apache2, php and mysql.

Its more common name is ARM, or the Acorn RISC (reduced instruction set computing) Machine (see here for more information). Some packages that are not multi-arch will not install properly, whether they are i386 or not.\nSide note: amd64 architecture can most of the time install and run i386 architecture programs.\n", "Q: How do I set up parental controls on Tahr? \nKeep in mind that this question is not asking for merely a time limiter!

Today I tried setting up OpenSSH on my computer with the hope of being able to connect to it from a different computer at work. This was my first time attempting to use open-ssh.\nI did the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n*modified /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n*\n\n*changed port from 22 to a number above 2000\n\n*changed PermitRootLogin to no\n\n*changed PasswordAuthentication to no\n\n\n*did /etc/init.d/ssh restart\nI basically tried to follow all of the security rules that were established in online documentation. I then fooled around a bit trying to set up port forwarding on the router.\nI assumed that since I had not generated any keys or set up any passwords explicitly, nobody could access the server that I suppose was actually running.\nMy question, basically, is that I've now become concerned by a few factors: my Internet seems slower, and I've had a few applications crash unexpectedly. It seems like all of a sudden my computer has become less dependable and my automatic thought has been to check my assumption that an open-ssh server is not accessible if its keys have not been generated and no password has been set.\nMy question then, is what is the state of the open-ssh server when it is restarted for the first time? Is there any way that it can be accessed by malicious people on the outside? Since I didn't get to the point of setting passwords or certificates up (because I got scared), at what point does the open-ssh server become a liabilty (i.e. hackable)?\nI sort of can't imagine that the server is instantly accessible with some sort of default password: that would be very easy to take advantage of, right? At the same time, though, I'm worried because this is all very new to me.\nSome things I see in /var/log/auth.log that worried me:\n\n\n*\n\n*messages from polkitd(authority=local) saying something about an Unregistered Authentication Agent\n\n*repeated attempts to access /lib/security/pam_kwallet.so\n\n*message that /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 has been linked to /run/user/112/X11-display (who is user 112?)\n\n\nI have looked each of these up and it seems they can be explained away but at the same time, a computer without this attempt at setting up openssh has decidely fewer weird messages like this.\nhoping someone can comfort me.\n\nA: I highly doubt think you were hacked. Maybe some automated bot TRIED doing something, but I doubt that even happened.. \nIf you disabled Password Auth and did not have a public key set up, there is very very little chance of anything even possibly happening.\nIn answer to your auth.log queries:\n\n\n*\n\n*That is just PAM complaining about something. Usually just a programming error or a bad dependency. Missing SSH certs maybe? (Nothing to worry about)\n\n*Pretty much the same thing as #1. I assume someone (sshd) was trying to find certificates and didn't find them. Certs are generally stored in things called \"wallets\". (Nothing to worry about)\n\n*User 112 is the LightDM user. It is completely normal for it to be talking to the Xserver. (Nothing to worry about)\n\n\n\nRegarding instability and network speed, you just enabled a server. It will definitely be slower. Even if nothing is happening. The increase in program crashing is also probably related.  More resources are being used on your computer now. Maybe there are a few config issues.\n\nAlso, I've dealt with hackers. If they got in looking for sensitive documents and didn't find them, they'll often troll. They'll delete random files. They'll wipe hard drives. They'll leave your system a broken mess.

I have an old desktop PC Pentium 4 with 1 GB of RAM, and it really sucks with Windows XP or even with Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) and exactly when I want to watch videos or films, I thought to install an old distribution of Ubuntu. Maybe it will make it better... So I installed Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot), but I was shocked with no updates, and then I understood that this in its end of life distribution.\nSo I searched a little bit, and I got that Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) is LTS, but this is also in its end of life.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I installed the Ubuntu 10.04, how is it going to work normally or I will get problems?\n\n*Sometimes I think this is a hardware problem. I think a Pentium 4 with\n1 GB of RAM doesn't suck on YouTube or during watching a movie?\n\n\nA: It is possible, but not recommended. All development has stopped on end-of-life (EOL) versions. 10.04 is still supported as a server until May 2015, but not the desktop version.\nReasons to avoid using EOL versions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are no bug fixes or security patches, making your system less safe.\n\n*The software is older and will not have the latest features, including any bugs that may have been fixed.\n\n*The repositories have been moved, making it more difficult, but not impossible to install new software.\n\n*If you run into any difficulties you will find it more difficult to get support on this site and Launchpad questions on EOL versions are off-topic, and you will just be asked to upgrade. The Ubuntu Forums are less strict in what questions are acceptable, but you are still less likely to get a good answer than if you are using a supported release.\nI would suggest you take a look at the question How to know which Ubuntu is right for my hardware? and choose either Xubuntu or Lubuntu instead.\nI'd rather see you move away from Ubuntu completely to another supported Linux distribution than use an outdated unsupported OS. Though if you do decide to go to another distribution you will have to use the support they provide and not this site as we support official Ubuntu variants only.\n\nA: It's better to avoid older versions, as they might not be supported if we come across any bugs. Try Lubuntu.

It's highly likely (though not certain) that this is the cause of the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*You should make sure you're comparing against the correct hash, though. The hashes here are missing for some of the newer iso files. In particular, it doesn't currently have the md5 hashes for the 14.04.1 images, which is what you likely downloaded if you downloaded 14.04 recently.\n\n*http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.1/MD5SUMS includes the MD5 hashes of the 14.04.1 images.\nYou should download the iso again, md5 test the new one, and assuming that one is good, burn a new DVD from it. If the .iso file has a different md5sum from what it's supposed to have, that means it got corrupted, most likely during download. (Or it's possible the download didn't finish all the way.)\nCorruption in file downloads is the exception rather than the rule, so most likely this second download will work. You should md5 test it too, though.\nBut if the md5sum of the new iso is wrong too, then provided you're comparing it to the correct official md5sum, that suggests a problem with the quality of the Internet connection used to download it.

Thats it. \nIf it does not exist, how to get started on this and write my own software ? Give your insights. \n\nA: GitHub Micro-Server Method\n\nTo do this, you will need a public key. Info on generating one can be found all over the internet. Do that now. You'll need it in a sec. You will also need the openssh-server package installed.\nFirst off, you need to prepare the environment for Git. To do this, you need to make a user.\nsudo adduser git\nsu git\ncd\nmkdir .ssh\n\nThis user will do all of the Git functions. You're gonna need your public key here. Simply run:\ncat /path/to/your/public/key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nchmod -R go= ~/.ssh\n\nNow, you have SSH and the Git user completely set up. Now, we need to make a Git project. To do this, run these commands (still as Git user):\ncd ~ \nmkdir git\ncd git \nmkdir project.git \ncd project.git \ngit --bare init \n\nYou must shell in and do the above commands everytime you want to make a new repo. More details later. I promise!\nNow you have a working Git server you can connect to! You can do all the fun stuff you like doing with Git now!\ncd myproject\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m 'initial commit'\ngit remote add origin git@localhost:/home/git/git/project.git\ngit push origin master\n\nYou can of course invite other people on your local network to use this Git server, as long as they connect with your local IP instead of localhost. \nNow, one project is most likely not enough for you. Fortunately there's a simple way to add/remove repos. Run the following commands:\nsu git\ncd ~/git\nmkdir project_name.git\ncd project_name.git\ngit --bare init\n\nThen, just connect to the other Git repo when you need to. It's all just changing variables!\nYou can also (if you want) have a web interface to Git. Info is available from the GitHub official source.\nSource for this guide: git-scm.com -- It is a great place for learning how to start a Git server. Start from 4.4 (linked) and move onwards.\n\nfile:/// URI Method\n\nFeh. As @muru pointed out in a comment, Git supports the file:/// URI. Here is a way to do it with no users, but no more micro-server in case your friends come over to play.\nAs you:\ncd ~ \nmkdir .git-projects\ncd .git-projects\nmkdir project.git \ncd project.git \ngit --bare init \n\nTo connect:\ncd myproject\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m 'initial commit'\ngit remote add origin file:///home/user/.git-project/project.git\ngit push origin master\n\nI personally like the microserver better. You can move it easier, esp. if you get a VPS.\n\nFinal Comments\n\nThe SSH server method does not allow you to save to an external hard drive (easily), but the file:/// method does. Just change the paths!\nYou could, theoretically, make the \"git\" user's home on the external hard drive, but that might cause more troubles than good.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS from USB on an UEFI system stops in grub rescue shell - how to continue?

But I don't want this message to show me and the OS to check the external device and to mount. Please help me.\n\nA: You either have a reference to the external drive in your bootloader (grub) or in the fstab. I bet it's in the fstab.\nBoot and check if the file /etc/fstab contains a reference to your external drive, the relevant line may have ntfs in it. Then edit that file (nano /etc/fstab) and delete that line, save, and reboot.

I've noticed that *.dnd files in ~/.kde/share/apps/ktorrent consumed 8 Gb of disk space.\nAs I understand, dnd means \"do not download\" -> just temp files? Wouldn't Ktorrent recreate/redownload it after deletion?\nIs it safe to delete these files? Won't it affect my active torrents?\n\nA: I've finally deleted it -> my 800 active torrents gone ^_^\nAnswer: don't delete *.dnd files if you don't want all your torrents to be deleted\n\nA: From my simple understanding :\nTorrent clients download pieces of data , maybe this piece for a file or another file or maybe it's the end of a file and the start of another one , or it's required to check the healthy of files \nI used to use utorrent in the past/$windows$ and they end with .bat so i delete them after download and seeding a little . Although , I don't use ktorrent but I suppose the all follow the same principle\nRead this from Bittorrent faq\nWhy does BitTorrent create or download parts of files I set to \"Don't Download?\"\nThis occurs because BitTorrent has no concept of files, only pieces. Because\nmultiple files can share the same piece, and BitTorrent has to download an entire\npiece to check its hash, it will effectively download data for another file\n(regardless of whether it was skipped). There is nothing you can do about\nBitTorrent downloading data for another file if the data is a part of a piece that also \nbelongs to another file that you do want downloaded\n\n", "Q: Which NVIDIA driver to install?

I can't shutdown. So I get trapped in a state where I can't open any application and can't shutdown. \nExample Situation\nI was working on laptop. I had rythmbox, firefox, codeblocks, notepad, files and terminal open. Suddenly, notepad won't save any more. So I closed it. Then the text file won't open any more. I realized what's happening, but I continued working so that I can use the situation to write a question here. After a while, the music stopped. Then firefox closed. Tried opening it again, but nothing happened. Tried to shutdown by pressing the button on the upper right corner of screen. It's suppose to show a drop down menu, but nothing appears. So can't shutdown through this. I opened the terminal. Typed \"sudo poweroff\", and it showed \"command not found: Input/Output Error\". Next I closed the lid of my laptop so that it sleeps. I opened the lid to find that I have been logged out. Tried to shutdown from the upper corner button, but the drop down menu did not appear. Next I try to login, but it says wrong password. I am 100% sure that the password is correct.\nHow I Get Out\nIt's an example situation, but every situation leads me to a dead end, where I finally simply push the power button of laptop to force it to switch off. I feel that it's bad, but it's the only out of this situation.\nSome History\nI was using Windows 8 before. I switched to ubuntu cause I was facing a weird problem there. Suddenly one day, out of blue, my hard disk usage started to spike to 100%. The laptop would get laggy and unusable. I switched to Ubuntu fearing some OS problem. But now even in Ubuntu I am facing a different weird problem. At least, here it won't get laggy. \nHow I use My Laptop\nI keep my laptop switched on for really long time every day. I will start my laptop the moment I wake up and continue to use it until I sleep. So that's around 12-16 hours. I tend to use Firefox for internet, Codeblocks for Programming and Rythmbox for music. That's it.\nMy Doubts\nIs it my hard disk? Is it getting too old or something? Or perhaps it's overheating. I don't use a cooler. Is it time to get a new laptop? I want to avoid buying a new one.\nUpdates\nThanks for the replies. I am trying to do what you guys have instructed. It is tough doing it while the laptop keeps on getting stuck. I managed to get few more data. I will keep on updating as I collect them.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried sudo shutdown now in the \"hanged\" state. It said \"permission denied: cannot access /var/lib/sudo/10.\n\n*I installed iotop. When I ran it during \"hanged\" state, it showed 0 write and read speed.\n\n*I am on process of doing SMART scan. But I noticed my hard disk temperature 45C/113F. That seems high.\n\n*When I went to \"Disks\" and into my hard disk, it showed 593 bad sectors. Is that bad?\n\n*I try to create a file using \"touch\" it says \"Read Only File System\". Can't use \"mv\" either. apt-get can't install anything either.\n\n*Suppose there is folder called Pictures. If I write \"cd Pictures\", it works. But If I write \"cd Pic\" and press tab to auto fill the name, the terminal closes. \n\n\nA: This will help reduce spindowns and spinups when your laptop is running on battery. Open a terminal and type the following commands:\nFirst, make a backup:\nsudo cp /etc/hdparm.conf /etc/hdparmcopy\n\nThen, type the following command to apply the needed changes:\necho '/dev/sda {\n    apm = 254\n    apm_battery = 254\n}' | sudo tee -a /etc/hdparm.conf\n\nFinally, reboot for the changes to take effect. You can test this out by unplugging your laptop and typing the following command:\nsudo hdparm -B /dev/sda\n\nthe output should say:\n/dev/sda:\n APM_level  = 254\n\n\nYour IO tasks can get all backed up and jumbled and I've found that \"noop\" works best for me.\nNoop sets your IO tasks to be done in the order of first thing first instead of prioritizing. To set your scheduler to noop open a terminal and type the following command:\necho 'noop' | sudo tee /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler\n\nTo make this change persistent beyond a reboot, edit the file /etc/default/grub by opening a terminal and typing the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nNow, edit the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto say this instead:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash elevator=noop\"\n\nPress ctrl + o, press enter, and then ctrl + x to exit the file.\nFinally, run the following command to update grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nFor temperature:\nInstall lm-sensors to keep an eye on laptop temperatures:\nsudo apt-get install lm-sensors\n\nAfter installation, open a terminal and type the following command:\nsudo sensors-detect\n\nFollow the instructions.\nTo view temps, type the following command in an open terminal:\nwatch sensors\n\nsee also: prevent-your-laptop-from-overheating\nand: monitor-hardware-temperature-in-ubuntu \n\nA: Try typing the command sudo shutdown now.

Run this command:\ngksu gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_restart_net\n\nAdd the following content:\ncase \"${1}\" in\n    resume|thaw)\n        service networking restart\n        iwlist scan\n;;\nesac\n\nSave and reboot. Now try to suspend and resume to see if it's working.\n", "Q: unattended-upgrades error: \"/etc/cron.daily/apt: DB Update failed, database locked\" Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\nSince installing unattended-upgrades, the following error message is received daily:\nFrom root@xxxxx  Thu Aug 28 06:36:06 2014\nX-Original-To: root\nFrom: root@xxxxx (Cron Daemon)\nTo: root@xxxxx\nSubject: Cron <root@xxxxx> test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nX-Cron-Env: <SHELL=/bin/sh>\nX-Cron-Env: <PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin>\nX-Cron-Env: <HOME=/root>\nX-Cron-Env: <LOGNAME=root>\nDate: Thu, 28 Aug 2014 06:36:06 -0400 (EDT)\n\n/etc/cron.daily/apt:\nDB Update failed, database locked\n\nThe error message is NOT received on days where security updates are actually installed and an automatic reboot occurs.\nWhat I would like to know please:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this error message a \"real problem\" since security updates appear to be auto-installing as expected.\n\n*Manually running the following commands occurs without error, so why is the (APT?)

Some specs in relation to my laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*8x SATA DVD±R/RW/Dual Layer (+ 24x CD-RW)\n\n*Has both usb 3.0 and 2.0 ports.\n\n*Will be installing on a msata SSD with no other OS\n\n\nSince Ubuntu gives you the option of either creating a DVD or USB to use to install Ubuntu I am wondering is their any advantage or dis-advantage of using one device over the other when both are present?\nMain items I'd be interested in is one less error/fault prone than the other and is it faster to install Ubuntu by USB or DVD? \n\nA: There is no advantage or disadvantage of installing it through DVD or USB. \nInstallation may be a little faster through USB. \nAlso if you use a DVD, you have the risk of \"disk read error\" during install, due to possible scratches of DVD disk. \nMy opinion is to use a USB \"burned\"  with unetbootin  :) \n\nA: You have USB 3.0 ports. If you have a USB 3.0 drive available, the speed alone should be enough to justify using it.\nOther than speed, one advantage would be availability of persistence on USB drives, but I don't think that would be important enough for you.\n\nA: If you computer supports booting from USB stick (most modern computers do), then go for installation with USB stick. Preparing USB stick takes far less time than burning DVD and installation time is also greatly reduced, since reading from USB stick is much faster than reading from DVD.\nTo prepare bootable Ubuntu USB stick, use official Ubuntu tool - Startup Disk Creator. Remember that USB stick has to have FAT32 partition on it. Otherwise Startup Disk Creator will fail.\nIf you are going to prepare USB bootable stick on Windows, do it as described in Ubuntu documentation: How to create a bootable USB stick on Windows.\n\nA: Errors are possible regardless of the media, but since USB is not liable to errors from surface damage and since it is reusable many times without any noticeable deterioration, I would suggest a USB.\nNeither is officially better than another, though, but some machines do not have optical drives, which is why both are an option.\nI will say it's super easy to dd to the USB. No burning involved.\n", "Q: install 12.04 version of edubuntu How can I change to edubuntu later version like 12.04 from existing edubuntu 10.04? my 10.04 version gives a message that gnome power manager not insatlled correctly.I cannot open my ubuntu os.

I chose .. \"Alongside another operating system\".. after installing when I restarted  I cannot see grub boot menu..it simply boots into ubuntu. Where is my windows xp? Does it get accidentally erased or can I recover it again?\n\nA: If you look at the Edubuntu website, you will see that 10.04 users might be able to upgrade, although \"sometimes\" there are problems.  I would take this to mean that although there is an upgrade path, it may not work properly, ad a reinstall is a better solution.\nThe Edubuntu download page gives you the options needed to download an appropriate ISO file to burn onto a DVD, and install from there.  I would recommend that you backup all of your important files, both in Edubuntu and in Windows before you attempt to do either an upgrade or a new installation of Edubuntu.\n\nA: Download the ISO and burn it to USB or DVD media and boot it. The installer will give you an option to update your system.\nThe caveat is that you will need to update to 11.10 first. You can read more about this in the release notes for 12.04.

If no such file exists, xinit will use the following as a default:\nX  :0\n\n\n\nA: Once upon a time(1), when the memory of the computers was measured in kilobytes and the disks in megabytes, running the graphic interface all the time was considered harmful. \nMost Unix computers were used for scientific computations and simulation in multi-user environments, and the graphic interface running on them would reduce the memory and CPU power available to them. \nSo when you needed a graphical interface you just started it with startx (2).\nstartx basically runs an Xserver (the graphical \"driver\") and a command which run on it, which is typically a window manager. By default the commands that are run are in ~/.xinitrc file in your home directory, or some generic system file otherwise.\nModern systems are thought from the bottom up to have a graphical system running all the time, so no one has probably checked the working of startx for ages -- that explains a lot of strange behavior you can have. \nIf you want to experiment and the feel the good old times, the best thing is doing the following:\nA) install Xnest and fvwm. Xnest is a graphic server-within-a-server, a kind of server that will open as a window in your normal system. Fvwm is a very simple window manager which was very popular back then. You will need old pixmap fonts, too. \nsudo apt-get install xnest fvwm \nsudo apt-get install xfonts-100dpi xfonts-100dpi-transcoded xfonts-75dpi-transcoded xfonts-75dpi \n\nB) write this file somewhere, for example in you home dir, and call it ~/test:\n#!/bin/bash \n#\nxterm & \nexec fvwm2\n\nC) Run (notice: startx is normally run with first the client command, then a double dash, and then a server command. As I said, most new systems do not have sensible defaults for startx alone.). \ncd ~\nstartx ~/test -- /usr/bin/Xnest -ac :1 -geometry 800x600\n\n...and you have a 80ies workstation screen: \n\n(You can have the menu by clicking on the \"Xnest\" desktop). \n...and if you feel really adventurous, you can start a native session on another virtual console (read the other answers) by going to one of them with Ctrl-Alt-F1, loggin in, and \nstartx ~/test \n\nwhich will normally open on Ctrl-Alt-F8. \nNotice: modern desktop environments are not designed to run simultaneously, for the same user, in two different consoles. So do not use gnome-shell or unity or modern things when doing this experiments, or you could mess up your configuration. \n\nFootnotes:\n(1) Speaking about around 1980-90 here.\n(2) For example, I had a laptop with 256k of RAM. It was painfully slow in the (B&W!) graphic interface, but snappy in the console. So I did most of my work (editing C, LaTeX and similar files) in console mode, and switched to the graphic environment only when really needed.  \n\nA: As Rmano notes, startx is a very old approach.  Way back when this was used, the X11 binary was installed setuid root.\nI just tried this out in a VM and indeed, startx fails as you describe, by default. chmod u+s /usr/lib/xorg/Xorg fixes that though.\nI don't recommend making Xorg be setuid root.  The world has moved away from that for Good Reason.  But if you're playing around in a throw-away VM, that's how to make startx work.\n\nA: startx starts the xsession or the graphical interface where you see a login screen and anything more than just an ascii console (text session). \nYou are receiving this error because the xsession is already started and you are trying to execute the command from inside the xsession on tty7.\ntty7 is the user interface that exists at ctrl + alt + f7 (default xsession).\ntty1 is the user interface that exists at ctrl + alt + f1.\ntty2 is the user interface that exists at ctrl + alt + f2 . . . and so on.\ntty1 - tty6 are text sessions and you can login with your username and password on one of these screens. After you login, you can run the command startx and the xsession will start in tty7 if it is not already running and tty8 if tty7 is already running an xsession.\n\nRun Levels:\nrun-level 0 Halt - Shuts down the system.\nrun-level 1 Single-user mode - Mode for administrative tasks.\nrun-level 2 Graphical multi-user with networking - Starts the system normally.\nrun-level 3-5 Unused but configured the same as runlevel 2 \nrun-level 6 Reboot - Reboots the system.\nThe term runlevel refers to a mode of operation in one of the computer operating systems that implement Unix System V-style initialization. Conventionally, seven runlevels exist, numbered from zero to six; though up to ten, from zero to nine[citation needed], may be used. S is sometimes used as a synonym for one of the levels. Only one \"runlevel\" is executed on bootup - run levels are not executed sequentially, i.e. either runlevel 2 OR 3 OR 4 is executed, not 2 then 3 then 4. - en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runlevel\n", "Q: Autostart program whenever a file is added to a folder I have Lubuntu 14.04 LTS on my laptop for a few weeks now. I have been working on customizing the OS and such quite a bit, as well as installing everything that I need for daily usage. One thing I did is write a C program that, when run, offers to quickly copy or move any file to any location from the Downloads folder. New destinations can be easily added. \nAnyway, I did this because I disperse my files all over the place from my Downloads folder, so changing the default download location in Firefox really isn't the answer. Instead, I want to be able to choose on a case by case basis. The program works fine, however, I want to set it run to automatically in a terminal anytime a file is downloaded to the Downloads folder. \n\nA: There are a few solutions:\nOption 1: without installing additional software:\nYou can use a minor script to keep an eye on the Downloads folder, like the watch command does, but make sure it only executes a command when a file is added to the directory. Copy the script below into an empty file, set the path to the folder to watch, and the command to run if a file is added to the directory. Save it as watch.py and make it executable for convenience reasons (so you won't have to use the language prefix). Add it to your startup applications:\n- in Lubuntu:\nPreferences > Default applications for LXSession, then choose \"Autostart\"\n- or in Ubuntu:\nSystem Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts\nThe add the command to start the script on login:\n/path/to/watch.py\n\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\nfolder = \"/path/to/folder/to/watch\"\ncommand_to_run = \"command_to_run\"\n\ndef get_drlist():\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"ls\", folder]).decode('utf-8').strip().split(\"\\n\")\n\nwhile True:\n    drlist1 = get_drlist()\n    time.sleep(2)\n    drlist2 = get_drlist()\n    if len(drlist2) > len(drlist1):\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command_to_run])\n\nOption 2: using inotify-tools:\ninotify-tools is a tool you can use (a.o.) to watch a defined folder and take (defined) actions if a new file is added to the folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install inotify-tools\nsudo apt-get install inotify-tools\n\n\n*Paste the script below in an empty file, set the folder to watch (\"/path/to/your/downloadfolder\"), define the command it should run (\"command-to-run-your-application\") safe it as notifyscript.sh, make it executable for convenience reasons, and add it to your startup applications: (Preferences > Default applications for LXSession, then choose \"Autostart\".

I am using PositionSource to get the latitude and longitude of the user's location from the GPS data provided by Ubuntu Touch. However I need to detect if GPS has been enabled by the user.\nOn reading through the official documentation for PositionSource here, I found that it has the property valid which quoting the official docs says, \n\nThis property is true if the PositionSource object has acquired a\n  valid backend plugin to provide data. If false, other methods on the\n  PositionSource will have no effect.\nApplications should check this property to determine whether\n  positioning is available and enabled on the runtime platform, and\n  react accordingly.\n\nHowever this property doesn't seem to update when I enable/disable the location service in Ubuntu Touch. I tried changing the GPS status both using the GUI (location indicator) and from the command line by,\nstop ubuntu-location-service-trust-stored\n\nIs there any other property I can track to check whether GPS is enabled/disabled on the phone?\n\nA: Applications should not rely on knowledge about the actual positioning provider but instead rely on the accuracy estimates provided with individual position updates (see http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/QtLocation.Position/#horizontalAccuracy-prop). With that, application developers do not need to worry about specific characteristics of satellite-based positioning systems (e.g., GPS, GLONASS, Beidou) and instead focus on the task at hand. \nMore to that, the location subsystem in Ubuntu might not even use GPS for providing position estimates but instead solely rely on network-based positioning. \n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu Studio recognize my M-Audio 2496 audio card I installed Ubuntu studio and tried to make it recognize the audio card m-audio 2496.

Thus you have two logical processors, but they share most of their resources (instruction decoding, arithmetic, etc.). This allows some parallelism — one thread can progress while the other one is blocked (e.g. waiting for a memory access) while keeping the hardware cost down (fewer components than two independent cores).\nLook at the rest of the output from lscpu and the content of /proc/cpuinfo.

I'm currently having some issues. I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my brothers' computer that has a hard drive with no operating system on and it doesn't ask me to use the whole disk, It pops up the Installation Type and I can click Install Now or it gives me a root error, And if I click +, -, or Change it freezes! Can I have some help? EDIT:When I click Install Now it pops up \"No root file system is defined. Plase correct this from the partitioning menu\" And allthe options are shaded out, except +, -, and Change... And each of them will freeze the computer.\n\nA: Test this:\nPut the Ubuntu Usb into the Usb.\nRestart your computer. \nYou should see a welcome screen prompting you to choose your language and giving you the option to try it from the Usb.\nAfter the session live load. \nStart the installation.\nSelect advanced or manual disk partitioning, for to create a custom set of partitions for installing.\nOn a default installation of Ubuntu 14.04, the installer creates just two partitions; the first for /, the root directory, and the second for Swap. \nWhen creating partitions for installing any desktop Linux distribution, my recommendation is to create the following three partitions:\n/, the root directory. The bulk of the programs used for running the system will be installed here and where programs critical for booting the system will reside.\nSwap, unformatted disk space for use as virtual memory.\n/home, the partition where your home directory will be located. In the course of using the system, files and folders you create will reside in various folders here.\nTo get to the advanced partitioning tool, select the Something Else option and click Forward.\nThe target disk is a new one and it has not been initialized, select it and click the New Partition Table button.\nSelect the free space and click the Add button.\nThe installer will create the first partition as a primary partition. And that first partition, following the recommendation made earlier, should be mounted at /. The default file system for / on Ubuntu is ext4, it will be /dev/sda1. As more applications are installed on a running system, disk usage will grow, so you want to be very generous here – if you have disk space to spare.\nNow that / has been created, select the free space and click on Add to create other partitions. \nNote that this step will have to be repeated for all other partitions.\nThe second partition will be for Swap. The installer will attempt to create it as a logical partition, the first logical partition of an extended partition is /dev/sda5.\nSelect Swap area from the Use as dropdown menu. The Mount point menu will be disabled because Swap does not need a mount point.\nThe final partition will be for /home. The file system is ext4, and you may use the available disk space here.\nBack to the main manual partitioning window, you can see all the partitions just created. Before you click Install Now, you have to determine where GRUB, the boot loader, will be installed. On a standalone installation, the best location is the default – in the Master Boot Record of the disk /dev/sda. \n", "Q: Trouble Installing Ubuntu 14.04.1 on Gateway GT5404 I have a Gatway GT5404 (desktop) with 2GB's of ram and a newer HDD, and a refresh of windows 7 ultimate.

I'm using an alternate installation CD in order to configure a software RAID from which to boot.\nI am using four 2 TB drives (sdf-sdi) to create three RAID 1 devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*two 4 GB partitions across sdf and sdg as swap space\n\n*two 2 TB partitions across sdf and sdg as ext4, with the bootable flag set, mounted at /\n\n*two 2 TB partitions across sdh and sdi as ext4, mounted at /home/\n\n\nI set up the partitions with the help of a tutorial I found on YouTube for installing Ubuntu 12.04 server; this is the procedure I used for each partition pair:\n\n\n*\n\n*create partition on empty drive (4 GB for the swap, remaining space for the ext4s)\n\n*set as \"physical volume for RAID\" (set bootable flag on partition mounted at /)\n\n*create identical partition on the physical device that this partition will be paired with\n\n*select \"configure software RAID\" > \"create MD devices\", and configure a RAID 1 device with two drives and zero spares\n\n*select the two matching partitions and finish MD configuration\n\n*select new RAID 1 device and set the \"use as\" option (swap/ext4) as well as the mount point for the ext4 partitions (/ and /home/)\n\n\nFrom here I select \"finish partitioning and write changes to disk\", select the default of no when confronted with the option to boot from a degraded RAID, and confirm the changes. Afterward the installation continues as normal and eventually I hit a screen indicating \"this new installation is the only operating system on this computer\" and prompts me to install the GRUB boot loader to the MBR. I select yes and at the bottom of the screen see the command: grub-install /dev/sdf /dev/sdg\nThe installation finishes without any errors and ejects the CD, but upon restart I am greeted with:\nReboot and Select proper Boot device\nor Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key\n\nI went back to do a sanity check and ended up just going through the process again only to get the same results. Then I put the Ubuntu boot-repair ISO on a USB stick and booted into that, and get a couple of messages upon startup:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"RAID detected. You may want to retry after installing the [mdadm] packages.\"\n\n*\"Warning: No active RAID\"\n\n\nFrom here it does not give me the option of repairing, just the option to create a \"Bootinfo summary\", which I did (http://paste.ubuntu.com/8200097/).\nI'm not sure I understand the errors from the boot-repair utility, specifically 1) how I'm supposed to install mdadm if I can't boot in the first place and 2) where the option to set an active RAID device was.\nAny suggestions on what the issue might be and how to proceed?\n\nA: You cannot install the Grub onto the software RAID Partition. When you create the partition for the first two HDD, it has to be:\nPartition 1: 250Mb example, for Grub. But don't do raid for this. Formatted as FAT32, set as boot flag. \nPartition 2: 4GB for swap. \nPartition 3: remaining space for /\nThe grub will be installed to the non-RAID partition 1, you don't get RAID-1 protection for the Grub. \nIn fact, the better way of implementing software raid in my opinion is to install the entire Ubuntu OS in another HDD which is not member of the RAID. Otherwise if the member disks has error, you might lost your entire OS and reinstallation is required. \n", "Q: Problem when trying to install fpdb on ubuntu machine I've been trying to get fpdb working on my Ubuntu desktop, but every time I try to install it from the Gz file, my system won't let me use ./configure (saying file not found), and when I try to install it from the DEB file, I get\nspencer@spencer-System-Product-Name:~$ fpdb\nPython 2.7...\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/fpdb\", line 85, in <module>\n    import DetectInstalledSites\n  File \"/usr/share/pyshared/fpdb/DetectInstalledSites.py\", line 47, in <module>\n    Config=Configuration.Config()\n  File \"/usr/share/pyshared/fpdb/Configuration.py\", line 805, in __init__\n    game = Game(node = game_node)\n  File \"/usr/share/pyshared/fpdb/Configuration.py\", line 397, in __init__\n    self.rows    = int( node.getAttribute(\"rows\") )\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''\n\nI'm something of a novice, so do you know anything that could help me properly install fpdb?\nAlso, I cannot find an installation manual for fpdb anywhere for installation on Ubuntu.\nAlso, whenever I run the run_fpdb.py file, I get: \n['matplotlib/gtk', 'File not found: pylab', 'File not found: BeautifulSoup', 'File not found: wnck']\n\nDoes anybody know if I'm lacking certain repositories or files, or if I need to adjust something to install fpdb?\n\nA: Regarding BeautifulSoup and wnck, I managed to solve this problem by installing these two packages:\nsudo apt-get install python-beautifulsoup\nsudo apt-get install python-wnck\n\nI didn't get errors for matplotlib/gtk and pylab, but I guess that's because I had already installed the Python packages listed on this wiki page before.\n", "Q: WIFI keeps disconnecting in 14.04 I am brand spanking new to Ubuntu and finally got it up and running.

Looking at top -0 %MEM, there are some xfce4-screenshooter processes taking fairly little CPU resources, but significant fractions of a TiB of memory (0.19) one process hit, which appear to hang as they acquire lots and lots of CPU time. I haven't reproduced the problem myself yet (hence no bug report), but I'm about to confirm and thought I'd reopen this as a prelude to an xfce bug report.\nIn answer to the question, if you are able to open a terminal window:\nps -ef | grep xfce\n\nwill give you the PID of the xfce4-screenshooter process, which you can then kill:\nsudo kill <pid>\n\nEDIT:\nLooks like this was already solved.\nGo to ~/.config/xfce4 and delete the xfce4-screenshooter file\n", "Q: Ubuntu Freezes while using terminal and firefox Hi I am extremely new to programming. I downloaded Ubuntu 14.0 and it keeps freezing while I am using firefox and while using the terminal. I would really like for someone to give me some insight into what might be happening. I am using a Samsung laptop and it has Windows7, intel core5 and nvidia graphics card I believe. I installed Ubuntu as a dual OS on my laptop if that makes a difference. Also while in the terminal I was using Python 3.\nAll suggestions are greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Because there is not an official answer to this question (even thought there are about 10 in the comments), I will tell you your problem. The default nVidia driver that comes with ubuntu (nouveau) is an ingenious piece of junk. If you install the proprietary drivers for you nVidia card, your computer will stop freezing.\n", "Q: Is syncing a MySQL database with Dropbox this easy, and is it a backup solution? Maybe I'm wrong, but I was sure that some time ago when I was looking for a way to sync my MySQL databases using Dropbox, I was told that this was not possible because of the way MySQL works.\nBut I just recently came across this answer, which seems to indicate that one can sync a MySQL database on Dropbox, simply by using symlinks. It seems too easy to be true, given than I thought I had been advised against it before.\nSo my first question is, does the answer linked above apply to my situation? In my situation, I only want to sync some MySQL databases across two computers, my desktop and laptop, and I will be the only one accessing them. The databases are for locally tested websites.\nMy next question is, what happens if my laptop explodes, and I get a new one? Can I just symlink to the databases on Dropbox and be on my way? Does this method work as an effective backup tool? If for some reason I wanted to add a third computer, could I just symlink it and go?\n\nA: Sorry... It's not that easy.  \nWhat you have to understand to see why this doesn't work is that when MySQL Server is running, it assumes (with some limited exceptions that aren't important, here) that nothing else will be tinkering with its files, and that it maintains some internal concepts, in memory, about the state of the files, that it assumes can't become inconsistent with the files.  If the files were to become inconsistent, through some kind of synching, then you'd have what was essentially just a corrupt database on your hands.\nWhen MySQL Server shuts down cleanly, it leaves the files in an appropriate state that itself -- or another copy of MySQL Server with a sufficiently-identical configuration -- can open the files and start running... but after a graceful server shutdown is the only time that this is true.\nThe only way to synchronize two instances of MySQL Server like that is to copy all of the files, in one direction only, with both servers in a stopped state.  \nThe same caveat applies to MariaDB and Percona Server.\n", "Q: Pokemon Trading Card Game Online for Ubuntu?

Is there a way to make services request permission to open ports? Basically to start up with all ports closed, as root so services will have to request permission to open them?, and you can decide to allow or deny the port to open. I’ve done an port scan with zenmap and there are several ports that are unnecessary open, and I don’t know what is coming in and leaving the system, especially form port 443, which is going to TOR so wireshark doesn’t really help. (12.04)\n\nA: To prevent ports from opening, you should stop the services opening them (or disable their automatic startup). Then, you will be able to start or stop them manually using the service command.\nOf course, it's possible to block ports with a firewall, but this will run useless services and create errors.\nBTW, the port 443 is allocated to bacula (a distributed backup program) according to /etc/services.

I have Wine1.6 installed in my system. I have a setup file of Macromedia Dreamweaver of Windows. Is there possible to install windows setup file directly in Ubuntu using wine? If is it possible,I need to know Installation steps. \n\nA: Yes, wine utility is used for installing and running Windows programs on Ubuntu. So your Dreamweaver should also install. But it is always best to install and use Ubuntu or that particular OS specific version of software because running Windows program on Wine utility doesn't work properly with full features. This has been my experience so far. So now I try to use only Ubuntu specific versions of Windows softwares. Check if Dreamweaver has any Linux/Ubuntu specific version and use that if possible.\n\nA: I highly recommend using \"PlayOnLinux\" if you are uncomfortable with the command line. It presents a nice GUI front-end for managing Wine virtual drives. You can either use pre-configured install scripts from the PoL team (I found one for \"Dreamweaver 8\" using the search bar that might work for you) or click the \"Install a non-listed program\" link at the bottom of the \"Install\" menu to use the executable you downloaded.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Help for PlayOnLinux\n\n*Ubuntu Help for Wine\n\n*Wine wiki on Adobe Dreamweaver\n\n*Wine AppDB entry for Adobe Dreamweaver\n", "Q: Upgrading To 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) Blew Up Grub I used the upgrade option available at the Ubuntu store from the desktop.  There was an option within the software updates to upgrade to 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr).  After I employed this to upgrade, Ubuntu will not boot and I'm at the grub rescue prompt just after the bios screen.

Am I on the correct path to fixing my issue?  And also, how can I fix the GRUB OS loader using my portable OS (that is on my thumb-drive)?\nI would be grateful for any information that would lead to a solution regarding my issue. \n\nA: \nAm on the correct path to fixing my issue?\n\nYes. It's possible reinstalling GRUB to the MBR won't fix the problem, but most likely it will, and it's the place to start.\n\nhow can I fix the GRUB OS loader using my portable OS (that is on my thumb-drive)?\n\nWhat you want to do is usually called \"repairing GRUB\" or \"reinstalling GRUB to the MBR.\" (It's called these things because it usually achieves the first, and it consists largely of the second.)\nThere are several techniques for this. Any should work. But if one does not, you can try another.\nSome are detailed in How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?). While your problem was not caused by a recent Windows installation, the solutions there will still likely fix it. (The parenthesized part of the title is an example of when repairing GRUB is needed, but there are other cases, like this one.)\n\n\n*\n\n*I'd suggest trying with the Boot-Repair utility.

I have a few MySQL databases that I would like to sync between two computers. What I'd like to do is be able to have a quick command or script on one computer that I can use to quickly dump the databases to a folder on my Dropbox. Then have a similar restore script that I can use to overwrite the existing database on the second computer.\nThe first step seems easy. I am able to create a quick .sql file with the following command:\nmysqldump -u root -p mydatabase > /home/dave/Dropbox/MySQL/mydatabase.sql\n\nIt's the other side where I'm having trouble. Apparently, MySQL won't easily let me overwrite the contents of an existing database with new contents. I've tried two approaches, and neither worked.\nFirst I tried mysqlimport, but it just burped out a bunch of instructions about how to use the command, and after looking around on the web, it seems this is because it simply will not overwrite a database:\n$ mysqlimport -u root -p mydatabase < /home/dave/Dropbox/MySQL/mydatabase.sql\n\nSo I tried to first drop the database, but I got the following error:\n$ mysqladmin -u root -p drop mydatabase\nEnter password: \nDropping the database is potentially a very bad thing to do.\nAny data stored in the database will be destroyed.\nDo you really want to drop the 'mydatabase' database [y/N] y\nmysqladmin: DROP DATABASE mydatabase failed;\nerror: 'Error on delete of './mydatabase//db.opt' (Errcode: 13)'\n\nIs there not a simply command I can use to take the database I dumped from one computer and have it overwrite its counterpart on another computer?

That was amazing !\nAnyways to my relevant question - is the 32 bit google -earth.deb file best for Ubuntu 14.04 Ubuntu ? Because with all the other dependencies being installed it still crashes. \n\nA: Yes you can install Google map 32 bit on your 64 bit machine. It will work fine. You can also install 64 bit version as well. Download and install it from here not from software centre of Ubuntu.\n\nA: Regardless of your systems architecture (32-64 bit), a 32 bit package will always install and run completely fine, similarly or exactly as it's 64-bit counterparts would.\nIn short, if you are having trouble installing 64-bit programs on 64-bit Ubuntu, then the 32-bit choice is what you should try next.\n", "Q: which linux configuration is used my my system? is there any command in linux ,which gives every specification of currently running linux distro,, \nincluding shell, desktop enviroment(like GNOME or KDE) ,display manager (gdm or ligthdm or kdm )and every other minute details that system is having,\nsimilar to when we go to buy a laptop we are a given with a complete specification list,,anything like that?\n\nA: Using the System Monitor is the closest I can think of to see what your system is running.\nFor example, Gnome, KDE, ect.. all show up in the apps list.

Here's the full report from it.\nNow I'm afraid to even restart because who knows if Ubuntu is going to boot... \nWhat should I do?\n\nA: First - fix Windows booting, second - fix GRUB2. Let's start with Windows booting:\nBoot from Windows 7 DVD and after choosing language options, start the console:\n\"Repair your computer\" -> \"Use recovery tools...\" -> \"Command prompt\".\nIn the console run the following command to re-install Windows bootloader:\n> bootrec /fixmbr\n\nThen rebuild bootsector if it is corrupted, just to be sure:\n> bootrec /fixboot\n\nAfter that You should be able to boot into Windows through the standard Windows booting - no GRUB, no questions - just power on and boot into Windows as in single-boot Windows machine. Now, when Windows boots correctly, it is time to re-install GRUB2:\nBoot from Ubuntu Desktop CD and run Terminal.

So I am 100% sure that the password I enter is correct.\nI've also checked if the first key isn't recognized, but even pressing space a few times and deleting every character after that has the same result.\nAny idea why?\n\nA: It happens because when you press the first key of your password the computer comes out of screen saver/sleep mode if it has been lying unused for sometime. So the first key press actually works kind of awakening the pc. And your second key actually gets typed in as first key. This also happens to me on Windows platform as well. So what I suggest is press space key or some other key (space is better because it is less confusing) and when password box appears start typing.\nPS:- Sometime you might need to press power key of your laptop to bring it out of sleep mode.\n\nA: One thing I have seen before is that the first key you press sometimes is not actually captured. \nTry dropping in a couple of spaces then erase them all. \nTry typing in your password after that and see if it works. \n\nA: Go to the path file: sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-auth and modify the below line\nauth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so nullok_secure try_first_pass\n\n", "Q: FTP account without linux user Is it possible to create a FTP user account without a user creation in linux ? \n\nA: Yes, some ftp servers can handle virtual users, ex. vsftpd and pureftpd.\n", "Q: Missing Operating System - Windows7 - Boot from USB I am using an HP TouchSmart 600 that came from factory with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.

Two of them will be discussed here:\n\n\n*\n\n*The drive contains confusing data\n\n*The drive might be failing\n\n\nConfusing data\nSometimes gparted is confused by the content of the partition table or some additional information for example the the drive has been used with RAID or as a boot drive made from a hybrid ISO file. In some of these cases some versions of gparted will refuse to create a new partition table and new file systems.\nThen it is possible to wipe the confusing information. Most of the time it is enough to wipe the first megabyte (mibibyte), to overwrite it with zeros. It can be done with dd, but dd is a dangerous tool. mkusb 'wraps a safety belt' around dd, and helps you do it safer.\nSee this link: help.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\n\nAfter wiping you can use gparted again. Create a partition table and after that you can create partitions with file systems.\n\nThe drive might be failing\nIf mkusb cannot fix the problem, the drive might be failing. It often starts with the symptom that the drive is read only (not only the partitions with file system, but the drive itself). This can happen with USB pendrives and memory cards, and is the first stage in the failing process. It is sometimes called 'gridlock'.\nBut there might be other causes of the problem, so it is worth trying a few things before you give up.\nWhen a pendrive or memory card is read-only\n\n\n*\n\n*On some pendrives and on many memory cards there is a small mechanical switch for write protection, that can toggle between read/write and read-only. - You might have set it read-only without intention.\n\n*Reboot the computer and try again to wipe the first megabyte with mkusb.\n\n*Disconnect other USB devices. Sometimes USB devices can disturb the function for each other.\n\n*Try other USB ports and another computer.\n\n*Try another operating system (Windows, MacOS) in another computer.\n\n*If you still cannot wipe the first megabyte of the drive, and the drive is read-only, it is 'gridlocked', and the next stage is that it will be completely 'bricked'.\n\n\nYou can find more details at the following link: Pendrive lifetime\n\nA: On the top bar of Gparted there is tab called \"Device\", it has the option called \"Create Partition Table\",  or maybe you can try using any other partioning tool, \"Disks\" comes installed with ubuntu 14.04     \n\nA: I'd try good old fdisk and see if that can create the partition.\nI'd also use dmesg to see if there are any disk IO errors appearing to indicate that perhaps it's not been able to write.\nWhat's the disk - is it a normal USB flash drive or something special?\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a Primary partition with ext4 file system\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on unallocated USB (/dev/sdb) and choose first option new ( insert )\n\n*Choose File system type ext4  and click Add. see image below.\n\n\n*Now complete this pending operation using green right icon above to the disk information panel.\nNote: Sometimes you can get an error, but don't panic, unplug and plug back, first do unmount the USB /dev/sdb  using context menu of /dev/sdb and repeat step 1 \n\n*Format to fat32\n\n\n*\n\n*After the completion of above operation , again right-click on /dev/sdb and choose Format to > and choose fat32 (If you require this USB to be used on Windows too)  \n\n*Apply to complete this operation .\nNow your USB is formatted with read write permission\nTo confirm this:  navigate to the USB location from Places and right-click on opened USB ,  you can see that the Create new folder and Create new document options are now active.\nI hope this helps you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 CUPS problem I recently upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04 on my laptop and I am not able to print on a network printer via CUPS anymore. If I run\nsystem-config-printer\n\nI get the error\nThere was an error during the CUPS operation: 'Bad Request'.\n\nIf I run \nsystem-config-printer --debug\n\nI get the following output:\nOpenPrinting: Init ('en_US', 'UTF-8') 1 0\n+<NewPrinterGUI object at 0x7ff964028460 (newprinter+NewPrinterGUI at 0xea5ba0)>\nConnected as user roberto\n+<PrinterPropertiesDialog object at 0x7ff964041dc0   (printerproperties+PrinterPropertiesDialog at 0xf0b3a0)>\n<authconn.Connection instance at 0x7ff964033830>: Operation += obtaining queue details\nAuthentication pass: 1\nAuthentication: password callback set\n1024: u'Bad Request'\n\nIf I instead run the command with sudo I can access the dialog and set the printers, but then the applications that do not run as root cannot see the printers set  by root.\nThe variable\nCUPS_SERVER\n\nis set and exported both by the .profile in my home directory and in /etc/profile.\nI googled unsuccessfully so far. I also reinstalled cups after having removed it with --purge. Any hint? \n\nA: We had the same issue after updating from 12.04 to 14.04, same error dialog box but still able to see the printers via a browser, and a similar error message from system-config-printer --debug . Here was the solution that worked in our case:\nIn /etc/cups/cupsd.conf we replaced the default browsing section with:\n# Show shared printers on the local network.\nBrowsing On\nBrowseOrder allow,deny\n# (Change '@LOCAL' to 'ALL' if using directed broadcasts from another\nsubnet.)\nBrowseAllow @LOCAL\nBrowsePoll printhost.yourserveraddress.com\n\nAnd in /etc/cups/client.conf we added /version=1.1 to the server address:\nServerName printhost.yourserveraddress.com/version=1.1\n\nAfter restarting cups with sudo service cups restart the network printers were visible and usable.\nI hope you found a solution sooner than this, but I wanted to reply here as I found this question when I had this problem the other day, and hopefully it'll help anyone else updating to 14.04 a little late.\n", "Q: MySQL: Can only login from command line or as root I've been trying to solve this problem for the last 3h. I've just set up a MySQL server on my dedicated root server, running Ubuntu 14.04-minimal. I have no problem logging in as root anywhere - it works just fine on the command line, phpMyAdmin or a php-Script.\nBecause I did not want to use all my scripts as the root user, I created a new one using this command:\nGRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER ON *.*\n'myUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'myPassword';\n\nThe user got successfully created and I can login with my password from the command line. However, it seems to be impossible to access MySQL with another user than root from something that is not the commandline. \nAt first I thought it might be the common host problem, where you have to use both % and localhost in the mysql.user database in order to access it from outside the console. But this did not work. I even added the two host entries that the root-user also has (hostname, ::1), but I always get the typical Error #1045 - Cannot Log in to MySQL server. What I've also tried is to directly connect in my scripts (or phpMyAdmin) to either the server's IP-Address or 127.0.01 instead of localhost - without success.\nSo here is the current status:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login as root from the console: Works.\n\n*Login as root from anything else: Works.\n\n*Login as myUser from the console: Works.\n\n*Login as myUser from anything else: Doesn't work.\n\n\nDoes anyone have an idea what might cause this issue?\n\nA: Finally, it's the reply, (see comments). I put it here to mark the question answered.\nSome special  characters in the password may not be forwarded correctly by php. Try with a regular password (ASCII 7 bit set, no control chars).\n", "Q: Leoxsys USB WiFi device not deteting in ubuntu I have bought a  Leoxsys WiFi USB device to use WiFi in my PC.

I have a lapop with an Nvidia card and an Intel one\nWhile I am using the Nvidia one (using PRIME profiles) I cannot change the display resolution using xrandr in terminal. All it does is that the display goes black for a second then back to the native resolution.\nHowever, when using the Intel card it works without an issue.\nThis is an issue for me because I play a lot of old games using Wine and most of them have very low resolutions and so, when using Nvidia, they are displayed on the top-left part of the screen, instead of being stretched to fill the whole screen like they do when using the Intel card (because the screen resolution will change to that of the game)\nI also noticed that changing the resolution through System Settings -> Display works on both cards but it dosen't help much...\nIf I could get xrandr to change the resolution on the Nvidia card then those games will work or if not then I could make a script to do it when the game launches and change back to the native one when it's closed.\nMy OS is Ubuntu 14.04 x64 and I use the up-to-date Nvidia proprietary stable drivers.

I want to install Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit, but the manufacturer only offers drivers for Windows or DOS but not for Linux/Ubuntu.\nSpecifically I am interested in LAN drivers for the Asus Sabertooth Z77 board\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: All open hardware drivers will already be included in the Ubuntu kernel as soon as they are available. Usually all mainstream motherboards will just work out of the box without the need to install anything in addition. \nThis may not yet be so for very brand-new equipment where there simply was not sufficient time to include their drivers in the presently released kernel. In this (rare) cases we may have to install a newer kernel, wait until a kernel supporting the hardware is generally available, or chose another, better supported hardware.\nTo find out if a given hardware works as expected we should query the web and Ubuntu resources for recent issues. Take care to not read all the many out-dated reports of issues that likely are fixed by now. But if you read many unsolved issues reported within the last months you may want to look for another hardware to be on the safe side.\nIn case we already have any hardware available for testing we can \"Try out Ubuntu\" from booting a live session to prove it is supported.\nSuch a search reveals that both, the Intel Z77 chipset, and the 82579V Intel LAN chip on your Sabertooth Z77 board are very well supported from the standard kernel. You don't have to install drivers.\n", "Q: software center has stopped working in ubuntu 14.04 Previously I did not have any problem with Software Center.

Linux appears to be a viable solution for my new and growing business.  The problem is that I am having an impossible time learning if it should be what I invest in without running into a sustained barrage of geek language (Juju?? Yum?? Stop it with the weird names already it's very distracting).  I am hoping for answers at the business owner level. \nCan I set it up and let it run with a modest (meaning business owner level not full time IT fluent Linuxer that goes to all the tech conferences) amount of effort?\nCan I set up my own cloud of collaboration for my team and clients?  Do I have to have my entire team switch to LibreOffice?\nOnline meetings.  Top priority.  Can I host my own online meetings or do I have to find a cloud solution like Webex or Join.me?  \nDesperately want to escape the insanity of Microsoft but I don't want to doom my new and growing business with an immature or unwieldy solution.  Thanks.\n\nA: Linux, Ubuntu specifically, is designed for ease of use. However there is no guarantee that you won't run into something that you'll need help with. I have no trouble with it, but in the least, hire a tech guy. As for cloud (online services) Ubuntu is pretty much universally compatible with anything you could possibly need. About LibreOffice, you don't need to be \"stuck\" with it, Google docs (as well as any other google service) work perfectly with Ubuntu.\nIn short, it's up to you. check out Ubuntu's business page for more help.\n\nA: IMHO, for an employee strength of 5, you would be better off with Google Apps than Microsoft or Ubuntu. It is cost effective and also has several benefits like strong collaboration applications like online meetings (Hangouts - lets you do screen sharing, audio and video conferencing , the works), integrates awesomely with android, ios or windows phones for email, calendar and contacts. For online meetings, you also have Uber extension for the browser. Works like charm.\nFrom a desktop or a laptop perspective - either move your people to chrome book or you can continue to use windows or Ubuntu or Mac. Google apps can be used right off the browser - any browser. Lets you sync with local machine - for any OS.\nFor 5 people organization, setting up Ubuntu or  Microsoft infra and maintaining a sys-admin does not make commercial sense - both from hardware and sys-admin perspective.\nYou can consider Ubuntu for desktop use - but if none of the guys in your company are a bit tech savvy, you should continue with whichever OS you prefer. \n\nA: What kind of business do you have?  If your clients accept having their data, communications, and work you do for them on the cloud then the Gdocs and associated approaches could be  viable.  If there are compliance, audit, and such associated with your work, you would have to think through the implications.\nI run Linux as a virtual machine on a Mac.  This is for learning different OS-es and general experimentation.  I've tried several flavors of Linux and I would only pick them for a business if the employees are technically savvy, know at least one distribution, and can get questions answered for themselves on forums like this and others.  There are so many flavors and sub-flavors of distributions and dependencies that a small business could wind up in a bind.  \nMac Minis could be a good option for you to consider.  Relatively low cost, stable OS built on Linux, good 3rd party software including a LOT of open source, can run Linux on them if you want, etc.  \n", "Q: Automatically Login for All Users I don't know, whether this is possible, but...\nSince I have lvm-encrypted my entire disk, I see no reason to type another password to login right after startup. However, at the moment I have two user accounts on my laptop. One for business and one for private stuff. I like things separated like this.\nIs there a way, I can enable password-free login after startup for both accounts? I mean in such a way that I can choose the account. I don't want to remove my user password.\nI'm running Kubuntu 14.04, but I think, this shouldn't be any different to Ubuntu, since both use LightDM.\nThanks in advance,\nCheers,\ndoublerainbow64\n\nA: The passphrase you enter on boot is to decrypt the LVM encryption done with LUKS, which is useful if your physical drive is stolen (e.g. your laptop is lifted). That encryption protects your system, but does nothing to protect individual users once the machine is booted and the passphrase has cleared. \nIf you had passwordless login for any user account, then after boot there would be nothing stopping anyone from accessing and/or modifying your files (and if you have sudo priviledges, this is particularly undesirable). This is very bad if you have a laptop (you're at a coffeeshop and it gets stolen or you lose it at the airport, already booted but maybe suspended, the finder/taker has free reign on your file system).\nBasically, I'm saying what you want to do is a bad idea, from a security perspective. The easiest way to do it, I would guess, would be to simply remove your user passwords, and as far as I can see any other solution would amount to doing just that.\nYou may find this post useful for some clarification on LVM encryption.\n", "Q: How can I run the slideshow in a specified order? I would like to view the images for example from the oldest until the newest. This is not possible with many viewers I tried (Mirage, Shotwell, Gnome Image Viewer).\n\nA: gwenview:\nThis is probably the best image viewer available at the moment. Built for KDE4, Gwenview comes with support for virtually all image formats out there, tools to do basic editing, tree-like file browser, support for tags, thumbnail previews, cropping, image rating system, slideshow, fullscreen mode, support for plugins and two view modes (Browse and View).\nLet's install and use it:\nsudo apt-get install gwenview\n\nNow select your images and right-click on and choose Open With ► Gwenview\n\nWhen the Gwenview GUI opens, select  Sort By ► Date under the View menu\n\nNow your added images are sorted by date, just go to the View menu and select Start Slideshow\nDon't forget: before Start Slideshow you should select all added images in the Gwenview window to select to show in Slide show mode. cool!\nAlso here are a lot of Ubuntu Photo Slide Show applications.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I just wrote a plug-in that allows sorting by date. It works with the GNOME Image Viewer (EOG) and I tested on the latest Ubuntu 21.10 and it works great.

The output of ls -la /media made clear why you did not have access to the partition; owner (root) and group (www-data) have full permissions (rwx) , others (like you) have no permission at all (---), that includes read access.\nWhat you can do is change the owner of the partition with the command: sudo chown -R user:user /partition (where user is your_username), and optionally change the permissions of the partition, at least to save your data. After that I would reformat the disk, repartition, give it an appropriate label etc, if you do not use it in your server anymore.\n\nA: Assuming you have permission to use sudo on your desktop, then you have enough permissions to view anything connected to it. \nYou also, of course, have authority to change the permissions on the disk, if you so desire.  It depends on what you want to do.  If you simply want to access the data, but not use the drive any more, you can mount the drive, then use sudo chown to make yourself the owner, and that will probably fix everything.\nThis is all basic linux. \n", "Q: PHP script unable to create directory with 777 permissions I have a script that automatically creates a directory if it doesn't exist and sets permissions to 777. The problem is, it's only setting permissions to 755:\nif (!file_exists($this->get_upload_dir()))\n    mkdir($this->get_upload_dir(), 0777);\n\nIf I check the owner of the directory it created, it shows www-data [33]. I'm not sure what the 33 means. Is www-data the user the server uses to create directories? If so, how can I allow it to create a directory with 777 permissions?\nAlso note, I have already set the following command:\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html\n\n\nA: www-data is the user that the apache2 webserver runs as in Ubuntu. (Usually that user has a UID of 33, the number you see.) So files created using the webserver are owned by that file. When you create a file thus, the umask of the server comes into play and any permissions you set are controlled by the umask.\nYou can work around this in three ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the chmod PHP function to set the permission after creating.\n\n*Use the umask PHP function to set the umask before creating. Be warned, this will set the umask for all threads in a multi-threaded server and can have unintended consequences.\n\n*Set the umask for the web server itself. This is worse than (2) in that every process and every site configured in the server is affected.\n\n\nThe best option is to use (1). Have a look at this SO answer for an example of (1), this SO question for a discussion of (2) and this SF question for an example of (3).\n", "Q: Eclipse slow to print keyboard input I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.1 and Eclipse Luna with Oracle Java 8. \nWhen I edit a file, Eclipse prints very slowly.

It can be changed by moving to headphones and pressing m.\n\nA: I spent a long time working with the same problem, based on lots of forum threads,  and nothing helped. Then I tried this:\n$ alsactl restore\n\nThat did it :)\n\nA: I found this tip for Ubuntu 13.10 and it worked for me after I upgraded to 14.04.1, maybe it works for you as well? :)\n\"Probably, your Headphone Jack Sense is turned off..\nTry this:\nOpen Terminal.\nType in alsamixer.\nLocate and navigate to \"Headphone\".\nPress m.\nThis should turn on your Headphone Jack Sense.\"\n\nA: This problem seems to have fixed itself, an update that came out last week made my headphones work again.\n", "Q: Upgrade 12.10 sources.list I have used\ndeb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal main restricted\n\nand the like in my sources.list.

Also, I can record them using Audacity.\nA major problem that I have is that they are just a little bit delayed. That affects song recording so I cannot follow the song rhythm properly.\nIs there any way to fix this problem? Maybe installing low latency kernel? How can I do that?\n\nA: *\n\n*In Audacity preferences \"recording\" tab,  you will find a latency setting to correct the delayed playing while recording: try to increase both values .   \n\n*Best latency is obtained using Ardour and Jack server: sudo  apt-get install ardour will install both.  No need to change the kernel but the file /etc/security/limits.conf must be edited as root: run    sudo gedit /etc/security/limits.conf  in a terminal and add these 3 lines at the end: \n@audio - rtprio 99\n@audio - memlock unlimited\n@audio - nice -19\n\nYou must be in the audio group. Check using the id command and if needed run sudo adduser $USER audio or if you prefer, install users and group management): click advanced for your user then  select \"use audio device\" to be in audio group \nthen reboot .    \nRunning Ardour will auto-launch jack sound server ( temporarily disabling pulseaudio). \nIn the session window, give a project name. In the audio configuration tab (see Note 2)  set a 256 buffer size for good latency ( higher value for higher latency in case you experience \"xruns\" (clicks) while recording. You will see corresponding latency in ms: it is good if less than 10ms, very good under 5ms, some modern pc can go under 1 or 2 ms . In option tab, verify that real time is selected. Click start.\nThen, in the Ardour main window, add a track and click its  \"r\"record button, and start record from transport bar . It should record fine, if not: have a look at this Ardour tutorial.\nTip: Press shift+e to get a mixer strip  for setting track connections  and level as shown in the tutorial.\nNote: If no audio is recorded or getting distorded or low level, verify Alsa audio layer capture lauching alsamixer in a terminal, or more easily, install and run gnome-alsamixer:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Set rec mode on the relevant fader, generally  capture fader\n\n*Set level using the capture, mic, mic boost faders.\n\n\nNote2: \"audio configuration\" tab in \"Session windows\" is displayed when you first launch Ardour: it can be used to set jack parameters (buffer, latency, real time). When you rerun ardour, it is not displayed until you kill jackd (command: killall jackd). But you have the same setting for latency in the jack menu in the main Ardour window or in qjackctl (another application to control and set jack parameters outside Ardour)\n\nA: You may try installing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Low latency kernel:\nsudo apt-get install linux-lowlatency\n\nOn boot press Shift, to get Grub boot menu, then choose advanced.\nSimilar question: Is it possible to install two kernels and choose one on startup?\n\n*Default Ubuntu Studio settings:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-default-settings\n\nwhich contains some audio settings like lib/udev/rules.d/40-timer-permissions.rules\n# make precisian timers accessable to audio group and MIDI\n#\n# created Sep 3 2012\n\nKERNEL==\"rtc0\", GROUP=\"audio\"\nKERNEL==\"hpet\", GROUP=\"audio\"\n\n(I haven't tried it)\n", "Q: Ubuntu server 14.04.1 LTS wont install any packages after reboot I just installed Ubuntu server 14.04.1 LTS on my old gaming pc to run a file server on.

So your best secure and simple way is to install 14.04.1 directly from the Live medium and do the backup of any important files you need.\nIf you have created a /home partition, even better, simply tell the 14.04.1 installation that you will use the /home partition already existing as your /home for the 14.04.1 install.

I wanted to use mainly Unity and use LXDE sometimes when I needed higher performance.\nFollowing a guide to do this, I used:\nsudo apt-get lubuntu-desktop\n\nfor getting the Lubuntu flavor. After everything finished I shutdown the computer, for some reason. To my surprise, the shutdown screen as well as the boot one has the Lubuntu logo instead of the Ubuntu one. A minor annoyance as it was nowhere written this would be one of the effects.\nThen, contrary to what I was made to believe, the login screen is the Lubuntu one. I couldn't find any way to choose the desktop environment from there so I just log in. After I login I see that the desktop is still Unity. To sum up: my LXDE installation made my Ubuntu believe it was Lubuntu, but left the only aspect I installed it for unsolved.\nAfter this experience, I decided to uninstall it using these commands:\nsudo apt-get autoremove lxde\nsudo apt-get autoremove lubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get --purge remove lxde\nsudo apt-get --purge remove lubuntu-desktop\n\nThe last two were not necessary, apparently. These operations left the situation unchanged. It also appears that the Lubuntu login screen just covers up the Ubuntu one as for a brief second it appeared after logging in.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*if and how can I reset my system to its former state, and\n\n*can I then install LXDE with the ability to choose between the DEs and hopefully be able to use the programs from Unity on LXDE (ideally without installing its own software again)?\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Go to Synaptic and search 'Lubuntu' and mark for complete removal.\nIn Synaptic remove lxdm (login manager for lxde) and also check if following packages are installed : unity-greeter and lightdm.

In a list, there is no empty space around the items, and the rows are stretched as far as the right side of the window, so no, it is not a bug that you cannot simply drag to select; you will alway \"hit\" another item when you start dragging, that is how it should be.\nYou can of course select items by either Ctrl+A (select all), Ctrl+click (to add clicked item to selection) or click / Shift+click (to select a part of the list), but that takes indeed the keyboard.\n", "Q: How to disable thumbnail generation?

Should we be upgrading away from ubuntu.components 0.1 in our ubuntu applications? \nI am working on one of the core apps, and many were unsure as to whether the current library (1.1 I think) offers anything like performance increases, or graphical tweaks.\n\nA: Ubuntu SDK promises to maintain backwards compatibility. As far as I can remember Ubuntu Components 1.1 was created with the introduction of new widgets like combo box, additional API changes, some performance tweaks etc.\nCore Apps are the first wave of consumers of the Ubuntu SDK followed by other 3rd party. I personally feel that we should be striving to be as close as possible to upstream in this regard and encourage 3rd party app devs to do the same.\nSo yes, it is best to leave 0.1 behind and upgrade to Ubuntu Components 1.1.\n", "Q: Disable login prompt through SSH when no key is present I've set OpenSSH server with private/public keys, with password login disabled.\nI was wondering if there was a way to not even show the 'login:' prompt when someone without a key tries to connect.\nEDIT\nOkay ... There seems to be some confusion as to what I'm trying to achieve.

What I want to do is not for actual public access though, but just me and maybe a small circle of other people.\nHowever, I want the sites to be publicly reachable in the sense that I can access them from any place outside my home network. However, I don't want to rent a domain for them, but access them just by the IP addresses.\nMy question is: how about public IP addresses? Do I need to have as many as the number of sites I want to host?\nI have a normal home DSL internet connection, and I think my ISP may only be handing me a dynamic IP address - but I still have to verify that, it may also be static.\nIn short, is it possible to host like three sites, accessible from outside, on the same box, over this infrastructure, or would I need to make arrangements with my ISP for a different setup?\nEDIT: Thanks for your answers, I'm not sure though I got it all figured out:\nIt seems that If I have a static IP, I don't need the DynDNS service, correct? It seems that I actually might, but I sent e-mail to my ISP to confirm (EDIT: no, it's dynamic).\nChecking my router's control panel, I can't find a proper interface for port management. This router actually belongs to the ISP, it's a Technicolor Gateway TG788A1vn.\nIt has a panel for managing firewall settings with just three preset security levels, and basically that's it for managing the firewall!\n\nIn addition, I can \"assign\" applications,\n\nI suppose the router manages the respective ports, but I'm not sure if \"assigning\" the https server means it gets to communicate through port 80. Would you think that's what this panel does?\nAbout the domain name vs. IP-only, I'm not actually opposed to using a domain (although IP-only might have a small security benefit?), I just don't want the extra cost. I wasn't aware there are free domains available, so that's good to know! :-)\n\nA: You can definitely do it, and it's not really hard at all. I used to do web site programming for a few small businesses part time, and I had several sites on my home server for demonstrating works in progress.  I used (and still use) dynDNS, for which I pay $25/year.  As someone else mentioned, there are free services, but they all require certain hoops to jump through.  I personally feel that the cost I pay is not enough to worry about.  When I signed up, they had free services, but I don't know if they still do.\nThe way DynDNS does it is you can register any number of names that you choose from their selection.  For example, they have one called homelinux.net; you then can register a name like \"Bennypr0fane.homelinux.net\", and it will be routed to your current IP address, which you maintain by running an update client periodically (they have help on how to do that, and even supply a client for Ubuntu).\nThen, you have a web server running, such as Apache, which has a virtual site running under that name.  You can have other sites running under other names, or other servers running with other ports.  I have my ebook library accessible via a Caibre server, plus websites.  You will need to tell your router about each port that needs to be accessed.\n\nA: Yes, certainly, be careful to open port on the public network, but if you want to do, you can do it.\nYou could use three different port on same public IP and access these site with:\n    http://ip:port/\n\nYou should configure your router to forwards and nat to internal static IP where apache listen with three different virtual host\nObviously, public IP address changes each time you reboot your router, so, if ilarsona'answer or even better Marty Fried' answer meets your needs, then you should follow it.\n\nA: I would advise the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a static IP address (honestly, so much easier). I assume (from now on) that you have opened up port 80.\n\n*Register a TLD (top level domain) - free ones are available, such as freenom.com\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Register a New Domain \n\n*Chose the domain you want, click search multiple TLDs and then select the top row. Click check availability. \n\n*Select the one you want, click the amount of time, then order now. \n\n*Complete the fields (100% free) \n\n*You will be sent back to the home page. Go to your domains... \n\n*Click manage domain. \n\n*Click Management Tools and then URL Forwarding. Forward it to a random website (like http://google.com) \nThat's registered!\n\n*Now for the DNS\nSign up to freedns.afraid.org, and add your domain. Steps how to follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign up (free), then Click \"domains\", at the side\n\n*Click add domain \n\n*Enter the domain, and see the highlighted section. We have to go back to freenom for that. \n\n*Go to manage domains again, and select manage this domain.  \n\n*Select Manage Freenom DNS \n\n*Select Before using this service, please click here to activate Freenom Default Name Servers.. \n\n*Finally, enter into the fields the following: \n\n\nNS1.AFRAID.ORG\n  NS2.AFRAID.ORG\n  NS3.AFRAID.ORG\n  NS4.AFRAID.ORG  \n\n\n*Go back to Free-DNS and click submit \n\n*Ignore the warning, and just click subdomains. \n\n*Click add \n\n*Enter the relevant details, and click save. Repeat for the other subdomains. \n\n*Enter your domain and click trace. This can speed up the time it takes to start working. \n\n*Wait for the changes to propagate across the internet - for me it was about 24 hours. I watched funny cat videos: \n\n\n*Now we have to set up apache. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make 3 folders in the root (/var/www/html) and give them sensible names. In each of those you need an index.html file (or whatever you do with your gaming set up, just separate it into 3).\n\n*Use this command to open the file in gedit:\nsudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf\n\n\n*Add in the following lines, at the end. I put it above the # vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet line, but that makes no difference from what I know.\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/var/www/html/game1\"   #Edit this line to have the correct folder name\n    ServerName game1.mynametestdomain.tk #Edit this line to have the correct subdomain name\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/var/www/html/game2\"   #Edit this line to have the correct folder name\n    ServerName game2.mynametestdomain.tk #Edit this line to have the correct subdomain name\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/var/www/html/game3\"   #Edit this line to have the correct folder name\n    ServerName game3.mynametestdomain.tk #Edit this line to have the correct subdomain name\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\n*Restart apache with\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nMake sure everything is working (as I said, it may take 24 hours+ to set everything up.\n\n\n*Finally, set up an index.html in the root that has the links to the other pages - just in case they visit your ip address.\n\n\nA: I do not under any conditions recommend you go off of IP addresses alone. They are always changing. \nThis question has more to do with the configuration of your router rather than the actual configuration of Ubuntu. On your router, you need to make sure that port 80 is open. There is always risk in opening up a port to the outside internet... keep that in mind.\nI also recommend you either invest or do a little searching for a dynamic dns update client. I had one with No-IP but I found that it was really annoying because you had to login every 30 days. Still, they gave me a more friendly hostname (like ilarsona.ddns.net). \nIn theory, for multiple websites, all you'd need to use (assuming you use No-IP) would be yournamehere.ddns.net/website. \n--More Detail--\nA dynamic DNS is not typically handed to you by your ISP. In fact, it's intended to get around your restrictions by your ISP. Static IP addresses are expensive, and what a dynamic DNS service does is uses the non-static ip address and creates a hostname out of it. It logs and changes the pointer back to your REAL IP address about every 30 minutes. \nWhat happens with your router is that, it wants to protect you from the outside internet world, and it doesn't realise that you actually think it's getting in the way. Without a router configuration, using a public IP address alone would not work. Thus, you need to open up port 80 on your router for incoming traffic, preferably to your server alone, so that the server can do its job. \nI've also found that browsers are often confused by \n    http://124.466.98.90 \n\n(or something like that) which is why\n   http://yourname.ddns.net\n\nwould be way more helpful. The dynamic IP takes care of all the hard work for you. \n", "Q: How to write a script to \"listen\" to battery status and alert me when it's above 60% or below 40%? I want to make a tool that alerts when battery is below 40% or above 60% so I can start/stop charging accordingly.\nI know some tools alert when battery is low, that's not enough. Is there a tool that does it when bat is high?\nI would like to write a script - either shell or python, that can do this. I know the command for checking bat status: \nupower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0\n\nBut don't know how to \"listen\" to the battery so that whenever it's status changes I can automatically perform an action. A link to docs will be nice, a tutorial even better.\n\nA: You cannot write a tutorial to create one script. That would be similar to a general python tutorial, which you can find on many places on the web.\nWhat I did is write a small script, with comments to explain what I did, to check battery charge every 10 seconds. That might be overdone. Change the line time.sleep(10) to set the interval (in seconds). The commands can be changed of course, I made it send a notification as it is.\n\nI made it run the message, or whatever command you give it, only run once per incident, so if charge exceeds 80% for example, the command only runs once, until the next time it exceeds defined values.\nHow to use\nThe script is meant to run in the background; copy it into an empty file, save it as check_battery.py make it executable and make it run on login: Dash > Startup Applications > Add, add the command:\n/path/to/check_battery.py\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ndef read_status():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reads the output of your command, finds the line with\n    'percentage' (line 17, where first line = 0) and reads the figure\n    \"\"\"\n    command = \"upower -i $(upower -e | grep BAT) | grep --color=never -E percentage|xargs|cut -d' ' -f2|sed s/%//\"\n    get_batterydata = subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n    return get_batterydata.communicate()[0].decode(\"utf-8\").replace(\"\\n\", \"\")\n\ndef take_action():\n    \"\"\"\n    When the charge is over 60% or below 40%, I assume the action does\n    not have to be repeated every 10 seconds.

It's easiest way that you run it in the background, inside a while loop:\nwhile true\n do\n    # Any script or command\n    sleep [number of seconds]\n done\n\nAnd if you want to run the script on startup and from then on every 5 minutes, so the construction would be:\n\n*\n\n*Add a line in /etc/rc.local to call your script (your battery_status.sh) + \"&\" to make it exit.\n\n*Add the commands you want to run in the battery_status.sh to execute in a while loop (inside battery_status.sh).\n\nNote that if you want to run it from cron, you need to set the full path, since cron runs with a limited set of environment variables.\nExample\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true\ndo\n    battery_level=`acpi -b | grep -P -o '[0-9]+(?=%)'`\n    if [ $battery_level -ge 60 ]; then\n       notify-send \"Battery is above 60%!\" \"Charging: ${battery_level}%\"    \n    elif [ $battery_level -le 40 ]; then\n       notify-send \"Battery is lower 40%!\" \"Charging: ${battery_level}%\"    \n    fi\n\n    sleep 300 # 300 seconds or 5 minutes\ndone\n\nSave this file by named battery_status.sh in your favorite location (mine is home directory) and add this line in /etc/rc.local file (in my example, just replace your battery_status.sh location by /home/username/):\nsh /home/username/battery_status.sh &\n\nThat's all. Reboot and see the magic.\nIf you don't have instell acpi, just install that using sudo apt-get install acpi\nOne BONUS\nIf you want to run make this script responsible with AC adapter,you don't need an extra variable to check that run for one time. If your AC adapter is plugged and battery charged above 60% it makes a alert to \"Unplug your adapter!\" until you don't unplug that. If alert tell you\n                             \njust unplug AC adapter then you will see the message alert don't appear again until your battery charge down to 40%. Then another message alert and tell you\n                             \nif you don't unplug AC adapter on above 60% or don't plug AC adapter below 40%, the alert message shown every 5 minutes (you can adjust that for yourself in code, see sleep [seconds]) show and Will remind you.\n #!/bin/bash\n\n    while true\n    do\n        export DISPLAY=:0.0\n        battery_level=`acpi -b | grep -P -o '[0-9]+(?=%)'`\n        if on_ac_power; then\n            if [ $battery_level -ge 60 ]; then\n                notify-send \"Battery charging above 60%.

The only way to get internet is on my phone. I turn on tethering and my phone acts like a WiFi router which allows my laptop to access the internet, but I need my Desktop to have internet because of the programs requirements to turn on. To reword, my phone has 3G and acts like a WiFi hotspot which my laptop receives because it has a WiFi card, but it also has an Ethernet port. I need to use my cable and connect the Ethernet port so that my laptop acts like a router and my PC can have access to internet but I don't know how to configure the laptop to do that. Both my computer and laptop have 14.04. What program allows me to do this Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Yes, this should be easily doable.\n\nIt's ridiculously easy. Simply right click on your network manager and\n  choose \"Edit Connections\". Then in the \"Wired\" tab, you can either use\n  your existing wired connection, (or create a new one by hitting the\n  \"Add\" button, name your new connection \"Shared Network Port\" or\n  something similar), pop into its IPv4 tab and in \"Method\", choose\n  \"Shared to other computers\". Apply everything and close the network\n  manager windows.\nNow when you need to plug something into that ethernet port, you can\n  share your WIFI internet conenction simply by clicking on network\n  manager and choosing the \"Shared Network Port\" entry there.\nIf you want this to be a constantly used ethernet connection used for\n  sharing and nothing else, feel free to edit \"Auto Eth0\" instead of\n  creating a new entry like I describe above. Creating a new entry gives\n  you some flexibility to choose however.\nNote that this uses a bit of NAT (network address translation) magic\n  to work properly, so the Xbox360 (or whatever you plug into your wired\n  port) will get a funky IP address.\nFrom memory, it will only be able to see the internet too - I don't\n  think you can see the host computer, the one with the internet\n  connection. You can set that up, but it requires a bit of messing\n  about with DHCP servers, I believe. I didn't need it, so I didn't go\n  down that road.\n  Source: Share Wireless connection with Wired Ethernet Port\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1-amd64 crashes on startup from DVD during installation -- possibly video card driver? I have never used Linux and was trying to install Ubuntu so I can have Windows/Ubuntu dual boot. However, I cannot quite get to the installation screen.

It's well documented here and can be installed with sudo apt-get install python-pafy.\nNote it comes with a command line tool called ytdl which seems similar to youtube-dl and, as such, won't really do what you want. You'll have to write some python. I assume by the nature of your question this is no problem, but let me know if you need further help.\n\nA: This is not the perfect solution for your problem, but it will maybe help you.\nyoutube-dl\nThere is a command line tool called youtube-dl, which offers many options. I think it will first download the full video and then convert to audio. I'm not sure whether there is a possibility to only download an audio stream, but I guess not. Also, youtube-dl is written in python, but it's not only a simple script.\nIf you take a look at the manpage, look for the post-processing options. --extract-audio for example will convert the video file to an audio file. You can also set the --audio-format and the --audio-quality. You can also run any custom command after downloading with --exec CMD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get it from the Ubuntu Software Center: sudo apt install youtube-dl\n\n*Get it from Github: Then update it with sudo youtube-dl -U\nVLC steaming\nAlternatively, you can use VLC to stream the video and just ignore or turn off the video function. \nIt should work to copy the url, open vlc and press CTRL+V or open a network steam (CTRL+N) and paste the url. Then click on Video->Videotrack->deactivate.\nNote that this will still stream the whole video, but it will not display it.\n\nA: If you have vlc and the text-based browser lynx (both available from Ubuntu's repositories), there is a neat trick you can use to stream video from a commandline.  The command I use will do a search and create a playlist of the first page of results which will play in vlc.\nI created a simple script to handle the tricky syntax.  The script is:\n#!/bin/bash\nlynx -dump \"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=\\\"$1\\\"\" | egrep -o \"http.*watch.*\" | vlc -\n\nSo, if you name the script, say stream_youtube, you can just enter \"stream_youtube \"search term\"\nI just tried it out after not using it in a while, and noticed a couple of errors popping up in a window that I never saw before, but in spite of that annoyance, it still worked.  Someone might find it useful, or at least interesting. :-)\n\nA: You can pipe the output of youtube-dl with your preferred format into ffplay without showing any windows.\nexample:\nyoutube-dl -f 251 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdRJMuOFO88 -o - | ffplay -nodisp -autoexit -i -\n\nthis is done via shell but you can do it programmatically if needed since both apps have python bindings.\n", "Q: updated to 14.04 on netbook, super slow, not working with monitor This is my first post, to be honest I'm not very experienced with this.

What it's doing behind the scenes is running the command as a superuser.

Thanks!\n\nA: You will not be able to do anything to any mounted partitions, and you can't unmount the partition you are running.  So, you will need to boot from a live CD or USB, and then you can do whatever you want to the disk, either shrink it or delete it.\nBut, if you don't care about the current Ubuntu installation, can't you just install Windows, and tell it to use the entire disk?  I'm not really familiar with Windows, so I'm not sure.  But I do know that if you install Windows, it will not preserve the bootloader, so you would need to know how to restore that even if you kept Ubuntu installed.\n\nA: I think that in order for the grub to work properly with Dual Boot that includes Windows in it, you must first install Windows and then install any other Linux Distro. The other way around, I think will have problems with the MRB.\nSo what I am proposing to you is that since you don't care about the current Ubuntu Installation, you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Windows from a USB.\n\n*Wipe out everything on your SSD.\n\n*Create a new partition and formatted in NTFS in order to install windows on it. (With your SSD size I would recommend to use 80gb for the Windows installation and 40gb for Ubuntu)\n\n*Install Windows on the 80gb NTFS partition and after everything is installed properly, boot Ubuntu Live USB to install Ubuntu to the other partition.\n\n*Format the other partition to ext4 and also don't forget to create a swap partition. Choosing the size of this partition is another thing, but you can take a look here.\n\n\nAfter you do all these, hopefully you will have a dual boot working properly.\nGood Luck :) \n", "Q: Command line command to refresh GUI desktop, like when pressing F5?

In other words, I do not have a problem now and am hoping to avoid one.\nMy research on Ask Ubuntu and elsewhere shows that there have been some bugs with Ubuntu 14.04 and Nvidia drivers (not just for the 840M driver) but that fixes were made or a least suggested. But I have seen nothing definitive, e.g. the Ubuntu Certification for laptops is barely starting with 14.04.\nI am about to spend a 1000 dollars and would love a little more assurance before I proceed -- my understanding is that a Live CD cannot perform a full simulation. Are there easy-to-recognize concrete factors which make compatibility (more) predictable, such as specific models of computer and their processors?\nI am a considering a MSI GP60 with an Intel i5 4200M  and an ASUS n56jn-mb71 with an Intel i7 4700HQ. Both use an Nvidia 840M graphics card. \n\nA: I had a very similar problem and spent several days trying to get my card working.\nI have an ASUS X550LN which has an Intel Graphics Driver on the CPU and a dedicated NVIDIA GEFORCE GT 840M.\nFirst, installing the nvidia-340 drivers would cause Unity and Gnome to fail when launching. I could drop to a shell Ctrl + Alt + F1 and remove the driver sudo apt-get remove nvidia* to get things back to running solely on the Intel Graphics Driver.\nAfter some research, I discovered that having both these interfaces made the system an NVIDIA Optimus (which is actually good just not well supported on Linux yet). Luckily, there is a project called Bumblebee which will help. More info here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\nHere is what finally worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install bumbleebee\n\n\n*\n\n*Add bumblebee repository: add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\n\n*Update repository information: apt-get update\n\n*Install packages: apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia virtualgl linux-headers-generic\n\n*Reboot\n\n\n\nFor me, at this point bumblebee was installed but the nvidia-304 package was installed as this is what is installed with nvidia-current. Looking online I found that I needed Driver 337+. At the time of writing this, the best driver for me was nvidia-340. This however is not in the default repo so you will need to add another one.\n\n\n*Install correct nvidia driver\n\n\n*\n\n*Add xorg-edgers repository: add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\n*Update repository information: apt-get update\n\n*Install nvidia-xxx drivers (for 840m it was nvidia-340): apt-get install nvidia-xxx\nFor me I got an error message the first time I ran apt-get install nvidia-xxx. However, simply running it again worked fine. I'm not 100% sure what happened.\n\n\n*Configure bumblebee to use latest driver\n\n\n*\n\n*Using your favorite text editor open /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf\n\n*Find the line starting with Driver and change it to Driver=nvidia\n\n*Find the line starting with KernelDriver and change it to KernelDriver=nvidia-xxx\n\n*Find the line starting with LibraryPath and change it to LibraryPath=/usr/lib/nvidia-xxx:/usr/lib32/nvidia-xxx\n\n*Find the line starting with XorgModulePath and change it to XorgModulePath=/usr/lib/nvidia-xxx/xorg,/usr/lib/xorg/modules\nBasically, replace all of the nvidia bits with the nvidia driver you installed in step 2.\n\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nAfter rebooting, hopefully you are able to access Unity, Gnome, or whatever display manager you're using.\n\n\n*Test that everything is working\n\n*\n\n*First test without using NVIDIA card: glxspheres\n\n*Second test with NVIDIA card: optirun glxspheres\nI hope this works for the next person!\n\nA: I installed a Lenovo Z50-70 laptop two days ago with an Intel HD 4400 integrated and with this Nvidia Geforce 840M GPU. I installed an Ubuntu 14.04 trusty thar on it (from an usb stick with UEFI boot). The system worked with the intel vga by default, yes, a current nouveau driver can't recognise the Geforce 840M.\nThe easiest sollution to work with it:\nIn terminal, add the xorg-edgers ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\n(type password and press an other enter after the ppa add request)\nUpdate package database:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nOpen the System settings window, than softwares and updates, and the Additional drivers tab. Wait some seconds, and now, you can see at least two component in the Nvidia list. Select the nvidia driver instead of nouveau (current stable version is 340.58), and wait for the automatic install (a progressbar will work in the window).\nOptional (but suggested for hybrid systems like mine):\nin terminal, install nvidia-settings and nvidia-prime (maybe installed by default, i don't know exactly), so type:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-settings nvidia-prime\n\nDon't install the prime-indicator, because it kills the good driver (unless the prime-indicator package is updated by the package maintainer, currently it is not)!\nReboot your system and (after some flashing at first boot) the 840M works well!\nIf you installed bumblebee or any other unsupported tool, you must purge these things first! Or you can try to tricking with this toys. With the official prime support, you can switch between the intel and nvidia chips with the nvidia settings application.\n\nA: Well, I had the same problem on my Z50-70. I tried many solutions including the ones described here. And I discovered something that worked much better for me than these two.\nFirst add the apt-repository: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa.\nThen update package database sudo apt-get update.\nAnd then install the nvidia-331 driver. Install this exact version, not any newer version. I tried some newer versions (and also lot of other stuff) and they were working but much worse. sudo apt-get install nvidia-331.\nThen simply reboot. Everything should work fine.\nYou don't have to install additionally any things like nvidia-prime or nvidia-settings as they are installed automatically with nvidia-331.\nThis solution is good for both hybrid and normal systems.\nFor hybrid system owners:\nThe default used GPU should be the nVidia one but if you want to use the Intel one (e.g. for saving power) you can easilly change it with nvidia-settings.\nHope that helps. :-)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.01 LTS can't access some websites Something is wrong with Ubuntu Kernel and Windows DHCP,DNS Server.\nFirst i will explain my problem in few words and then ill post all my configurations.\nMy ubuntu computer is behind a all-in-one Windows Server DHCP,DNS , Firewall.\nMy ubunut installation is not able to ping , traceroute , telnet some websites.

I've read that if anacron is enabled cron doesn't run the scripts inside cron.weekly/hourly/daily/hourly, as not to run them twice.

Again, notice the .old extension, which is different from the story linked in \"Damaged links after kernel uninstall\") and creates two new files /vmlinuz /initrd.img.\nWhen you run apt-get autoremove (the messages weren't generated by apt-get -f install) it removes that previously active kernel (you rebooted after that install, before running autoremove, right?), which makes the links invalid.\nWhen the removal of the kernel itself done, the autoremove itself invokes update-grub:\nrun-parts: executing /etc/kernel/postrm.d/zz-update-grub 3.13.0-32-generic /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-32-generic\n\nHence:\nThe link /vmlinuz.old is a damaged link\nRemoving symbolic link vmlinuz.old \n you may need to re-run your boot loader[grub]\n\nSo, autoremove does:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove old kernel \n\n*run update-grub \n\n*update-grub removes .old files which linked to removed files.\n\n\nNothing to worry about :-)\nRegards.\n\nA: According to womble's answer to Damaged /vmlinuz and /initrd.img symbolic links after Kernel uninstall (on Server Fault), you don't have to do anything in this situation when your boot loader is GRUB/GRUB2—which it is, here.\nFor some other boot loaders (at least LILO), it is/was apparently sometimes necessary to manually run the boot loader's configuration.\nIf you did need to tell GRUB to check for existing kernels and update its configuration, running sudo update-grub would do so. And there's no harm in running that. But it shouldn't be necessary in this case.\n\nA: $ sudo update-grub\nAnd if you want delete / purge old packages you can do also \n$ dpkg --list |grep \"^rc\" | cut -d \" \" -f 3 | xargs sudo dpkg --purge\n", "Q: Not able to login into ubuntu 12.04 I am now using ubuntu 12.04.

You can upgrade your current installation from there and you don't have to make a fresh install. This involves less risk than by upgrading via do-release-upgrade form the terminal because you already have all the necessary files on your USB. \nBut I would also make a backup of all your files first, or those you can't lose. \nHere are some alternatives on how to backup your files, there are others but these are the ones I would try. \n\n\n*\n\n*live-usb\nBoot the USB -> try Ubuntu -> mount the partition -> backup the files.\n\n*graphical via the network\nvia the network when the computer is running, network -> your computer -> log in with user/password if\nyou have installed and configured this (your home folder needs to be\nshared with the network for this to work).\n\n*SSH\ncopy the files via ssh to another device/computer\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Remmina and Vinagre alternatives for VNC with ssh-tunnel support I'm using Remmina for connect to other computers using VNC. But it's often buggy when I choose ssh-tunnel. Vinagre works better, but it's not able to manage bookmarks. Are there ways to solve problems with remmina and vinagre? Or are there better alternatives of this software?\n\nA: Remmina works well for me though I need to establish the ssh tunnel in a terminal before hand.\nFor a one step VNC through SSH solution I use ssvnc. After some initial setup for each connnection I can establish a link quickly. I don't like the VNC client as much as Vinagre or Remmina but it works well.\n", "Q: Can I use TLP and CPUFreq at the same time? I just started using ubuntu 14.04 recently. I read that it's good to have CPUFreq or TLP. I was wondering if it would be okay to have both.\nWould it cause any problems with the computer performance if I have both running?\n\nA: CPUfreq is actually built-in with the Linux kernel. This is the tool that manages CPU frequency. You may be thinking of indicator-cpufreq, which adds a function to the panel allowing the user to easily control CPUfreq settings. This is a simple way to change between frequencies or governors. The cpufrequtils package is a dependency of indicator-cpufreq, but is not needed by TLP.\nTLP is an optional program that can be installed. It manages many different settings for power consumption. CPU frequency is one of these that it can manage, and it uses CPUfreq in the kernel to do this.\nSo you already have CPUfreq by default. TLP can help managing power settings, and CPUfreq is one of the many tools it can control. The CPUfreq indicator is another option for managing CPUfreq.\nSee this explanation for more info about this.\nIs there a power saving application similar to Jupiter?\n\nA: You don't need both.

So I added the following code to the bottom of profile after:\nsudo gedit etc/profile\n\nCode added to profile:\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_20\nPATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin JRE_HOME=/usr/local/java/jre1.8.0_20\nPATH=$PATH:$JRE_HOME/bin HADOOP_INSTALL=/home/{user_name}/hadoop/hadoop-1.2.1\nPATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_INSTALL/bin\nexport JAVA_HOME\nexport JRE_HOME\nexport PATH\n\nOK - so no problem.  I saved, closed, and went back to terminal and didn't think I did anything that would somehow delete the whole profile.  But, that's what seems to have happened??  Now when I do gedit etc/profile code, the whole thing is completely blank?  Sorry if I'm just not looking in the right place and this is a stupid question.\nEDIT:\nSo when I do edit profile code, it's a different profile.  The original one is indeed intact; at least I can open it from the text editor.  But how can I reopen the original (proper) profile?  Every time I try \nsudo gedit etc/profile\n\nIt brings up a NEW, blank profile.  Did I add those Java/Hadoop paths to the right profile in the first place?  Must it be a certain profile within a certain directory (and is the directory when I enter the above line of code the determinant of the sole location where the profile exists/applies?)\n\nA: Okay so here are a couple of points for for what you're doing wrong and how you should fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*The command you're supposed to run is sudo gedit /etc/profile, not etc/profile. That / before etc is very crucial. The command you are executing is trying to open another file, and if that file doesn't exist, you'll see a completely blank page like the one you're seeing.\n\nNote: you shouldn't be using sudo with gedit. Use gksu gedit /etc/profile. If that gives you an error, use sudo nano /etc/profile instead. This will not open up a pretty text editor like gedit, but it will allow you to edit the file from inside the terminal. To save your changes and close, hit Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter. If you don't want to save your changes, hit Ctrl+X, then N.\n\n\n*You shouldn't actually be using /etc/profile. It's better to add the code you're trying to copy into ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile (which is the same as /home/YourUserName/.bashrc and /home/YourUserName/.profile). So you edit that file using gksu gedit ~/.bashrc or sudo nano ~/.bashrc (and the same for the other .profile file).\n\n*You have a few mistakes in the code you're trying to copy. It should look like this:\n\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_20\nJRE_HOME=/usr/local/java/jre1.8.0_20\nHADOOP_INSTALL=/home/YourUserName/hadoop/hadoop-1.2.1\nPATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_INSTALL/bin\nexport JAVA_HOME\nexport JRE_HOME\nexport HADOOP_INSTALL\nexport PATH\n\nYou have to obviously change YourUserName to your actual username.\nSo, continue with whatever guide you're following and you should be set.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Elantech touchpad too sensitive I am using samsung series 3 laptop.

I've filename specified. So will recursion look within all sub directories for *.QTFS or just inside current dir (vod)? I imagine later... so in this case recursion flag doesn't do anything, correct?\nsudo rm -R *.QTFS series/*\n\nThis was my undoing command. Anyhow, so in this case I just gave rm two separate delete commands, correct?\nfirst delete recursively *.QTFS, but this part only looks inside current dir (vod).\nSecond deletes recursively contents of series directory.\nIn essence I'm trying to understand if I deleted something beyond obvious damage.\n\nA: Both -r and -R are aliases for --recursive, which the manpage describes as:\n\nremove directories and their contents recursively\n\nIf you do rm -r file1 file2, the option is passed to both files. Since the recursion only applies to directories (you can't recursively act on a single level), this would do little more than delete both files.\nIf you do rm -r folder1 folder2, it will recursively delete everything within those folders and the folders themselves.\nAs far as how filename expansion aka globbing works, * means any number of characters, so *.QTFS means any file in $PWD ending with .QTFS and service/* means any file within the $PWD/service folder. \nThat being said, as long as that's what you wanted to delete, you should be fine.\nUse -i or --interactive to force rm to ask for confirmation at every removal, or -I or --interactive=once to ask once if your command would remove four or more files, or would recursively remove files. \nUse -f or --force to cause rm to silently ignore non-existent files, and to not prompt for confirmation before removing a read-only file or directory.\nYou might want to look into trash if you want an undelete command of sorts. It interacts with the trashcan, giving you the option to have a fallback if need be.\n\nA: *\n\n*switch \"r\" is used for allowing rm command to delete folders also including the files in it.\n\n*Switch \"f\" is to instruct rm to force fully delete the file. In this case if file or folder dos not exists, rm command will not give any error message.\n\n", "Q: Uninstall OS running in dual boot Supposing I have two Linux distributions, in dual boot (the GRUB menu appears and ask me what to choose):\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04\n\n*elementary OS\n\n\nAdding a new one is very simple: just insert the installation device and start installing.\nWhat about uninstalling one?

In our servers infrastructure, for logging, we use a client/server setup, using syslog-ng, and stunnel as a mean of compression at the network level, through zlib at the SSL layer (syslog-ng doesn't support over the wire compression on the OSE edition - they lie on their website).\nUpon installing Ubuntu 14.04, I've found that the 1.0.1f-1ubuntu1 version of OpenSSL entirely disabled compression, which makes the stunnel layer pointless, and leaves the infrastructure without network-level compression (which is crucial).\nIs there any suggestion on how to cleanly work this around? I have a few thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*given the OpenSSL developments, I don't think it would be safe to downgrade\n\n*given that the pace of security fixes increased, it wouldn't be feasible to build the package manually\n\n*I don't know any alternative for compressing the network connection of syslog-ng.\n\n\nIs it expected for OpenSSL to re-enable the (zlib) compression?\n\nA: syslog-ng OSE doesn't support on-the-wire compression at the moment.

There's a list of Hikvision ones here but it's going to look something like: rtsp://IPADDRESS:554/h264\nWe can then run avconv (from the libav-tools package, or ffmpeg from any reputable PPA you can find) to capture and keep capturing once a second (based on this):\navconv -i rtsp://IPADDRESS:554/h264 -f image2 -r 1 -updatefirst 1 /path/to/img.jpg\n\nThat pulls us back around to the SimpleCV.

Look also \"configuration\" tab  and test other profile.\nIf it stills not good,  when sound stops, copy and run this in a terminal:  \nkillall -9 pulseaudio \nClose and reopen audio apps and test.\nIf not good, copy and run that commands in a terminal:\nkillall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.config/pulse/* ; rm -r ~/.pulse*; ~/.config/pulse\nand reboot\n", "Q: Log in loops again for a particular user I was logging into my ubuntu machine till last night.

Is the encfs project no longer maintained? It seems the last update 1.7.4 was released on November 18 2010. In a security audit several weaknesses have been identified, but no updates have since been issued. Should encfs still be used? if not, why is it in the standard repositories of Ubuntu?\n\nA: The project lives, and is working on a 2.0 revision:\nhttps://github.com/vgough/encfs\n\"EncFS has been dormant for a while. I've started cleaning up in order to try and provide a better base for a version 2, but whether EncFS flowers again depends upon community interest. In order to make it easier for anyone to contribute, it is moving a new home on Github. So if you're interested in EncFS, please dive in!\"﻿\n\nA: Yes, it does look as if encfs is no longer maintained. It is in Ubuntu 14.04 because it still is in Debian wheezy. It has been removed from Debian jessie, so should be gone from future versions of Ubuntu. Like the OP in this Debian bug report, I do not have the competence to judge this, but I recommend that you do not use it unless you have to, given the removal from jessie.\n\nA: Edit: See the comment by jpnp below which suggests gocryptfs\nAs this answer states encfs is indeed not safe nor maintained any longer.\nSo to completely answer your question there are several alternatives to encrypt files and folders, listed from simple to extensive encryption possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG)\n\n*Hidden encrypted volumes using TrueCrypt (GUI) \n\n*eCryptfs\nAnd there are really many more.\nAlso look here for a similar answer, it might help you.\n", "Q: How do I discover my socket type? I want to upgrade my CPU, but Ubuntu's \"About This Computer\" window only gives me \"Intel® Core™ i3 CPU 530 @ 2.93GHz × 4\", so no information on the connector/socket type. So far, I've tried the following methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running x86info -a and looking for any information on \"connector type\" (there was no such line, and x86info actually guessed my CPU as an i7);\n\n*Running dmidecode -t 4 showed Socket Designation: CPU 1, which is not useful\n\n*Running cat proc/cpuinfo also shows no information about my socket type.\n\n\nFrom research and eyeballing, I guess I'm dealing with a Clarkdale i3, so the socket would be LGA 1156. However, I'm still looking for a software confirmation before I commit my money.\nRelated question: https://serverfault.com/q/74658\n\nA: I'd stick intel i3 530 (the product name) into Google and end up on its ark.intel.com page:\nSockets Supported   FCLGA1156\n\n\nIf you're less confident about the CPU model (or there are two SKUs with the same model - ARK would tell you) you could look at the current motherboard.

I kept my finger pushing on the \"shut down\" button next to its keyboard but it refuses to shut down. Now the temperature of my laptop increases and it is Summer here in France. Please what can I do to shut it down ? Thank you for your help in advance\n\nA: This problem can be solved in the following ways--\n1.Get back to any terminal by pressing ctrl+Alt+F1 (or up to F6),then type sudo poweroff\n2.Hold down the power button until it shuts down.\n3.Remove the battery,wait for some minutes and then insert it and boot.\nIf none above works ,then, Wait for discharging of the battery and let it cool down,and boot it after charging.\n", "Q: Blocking HTTP requests without Host header using mod_security2 In my Apache configuration, I want to allow only Host header based vhosts. That is, I'd like to block any traffic by IP address only. I have mod_security2 installed, but I am only using the default rule set. Is mod_security2 the best place to configure this, and if so, how?\nApache 2.4.7, Ubuntu 14.04, PHP 5.5.9\n\nA: Add this to your <Directories> chapters in your httpd.conf wherever you want it to apply (e.g. the /var/www and /var/www/html chapters on the default config)\n <RequireAll>\n    Require expr ( -n %{HTTP_HOST} && %{HTTP_HOST} != \"1.2.3.4\" )\n </RequireAll>\n\n-n matches \"not empty\" and the rest matches a Host: header not equal to your server's IP. You might need to repeat the second half with your public and internal IP, depending on your web routing setup.\n\nA: I would suggest you to read my answer of the question I need rules to drop some malicious Apache, where is explained how to download and configure OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set 3.x.\nHowever, here is simple example of the rule that you are asking for:\n# Deny requests without a host header\n#\nSecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Host \"@eq 0\" \\\n    \"id:160, phase:2, log, drop, deny, status:403, \\\n        tag:'requests-without-host-header'\"\n\nThe most important thing in the above rule is the parameter phase:2, thus the access will be denied before the response, but you will be able to white-list the rule at certain circumstances (if you need that) on phase:1. You can use nolog, also the final result of drop, deny and status:403 is almost identical and you can decide to leave only one of these three arguments.   \nCheckout rule id:160 in my repository pa4080/www-security-assistant for more complex example. Also you may want to read the section Missing/Empty Host Header in REQUEST-920-PROTOCOL-ENFORCEMENT from SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs 3.x.\n", "Q: Are softlinks and hardlinks somewhat related to mutable and immutable objects (in java) in any sense? While reading about linux,I got the following:\n\nSuppose that file1 already exists. A hard link, called file2, is\n  created with the command:\n$ ln file1 file2\nNote that two files now appear to exist. However, a closer inspection\n  of the file listing shows that this is not quite true.\n$ ls -li file1 file2\nThe -i option to ls prints out in the first column the inode number,\n  which is a unique quantity for each file object. This field is the\n  same for both of these files;  what is really going on here is that it\n  is only one file but it has more than one name  associated with it, \n  as is indicated by the 3 that appears in the ls output.  Thus,  there\n  already was another object linked to file1 before the command was\n  executed.\nHard links are very useful and they save space, but you have to be\n  careful with  their  use, sometimes in subtle ways. For one thing if\n  you remove either file1 or file2 in the  example on the previous\n  screen, the inode object (and the remaining file name) will  remain,\n  which might be undesirable as it may lead to subtle errors later if\n  you recreate  a file of that name.\n\nI am not getting the notion of file object as stated above as UNIX has been made purely in C(correct me If I am wrong). Is it somewhat similar to mutable and immutable classes in Java?\n\nA: No, but hard links works exactly as object references in Java. You can copy a reference to any number of variables, it will not duplicate the object. You can clear these variables or delete them, but the object will be cleared only when the last reference will be cleared (not the last created).\nHard links are the same: they're reference to the real file object, or in other words directory entries. Creating a hard link is creating another reference to the file object in another directory. When you rm a file somewhere, it doesn't destroy the file object if another reference (inode) to it exists somewhere else.\nThey're different from soft links (shortcuts) because deleting a shortcut never erase the file.\n", "Q: Create Ubuntu 14.04 system image and install on other machine I have Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit) installed in my laptop (core i5, 6GB RAM) and there are several software installed like R, Octave etc.\nI want to create a system image and use that image to install Ubuntu in another laptop of same configuration.

I unplugged my cable, did an offline installation, and now, even with all the correct parameters set in /etc/network/interfaces, it doesn't load the settings. Doing  ifconfig -a just shows em1 as being unprogrammed. I can set the parameters using ifconfig add... etc... but for whatever reason em1 is not loading what I have in the config file.\nAll I am asking now, is why would em1 ignore the config file, or just fail to load it?\n\nA: My focus was to get static networking to work, period, no matter the name.\nI found that the udev script that creates the 70-persistent-net.rules was in fact white-listing everything BUT em1, so it was not being generated. I white-listed em* to resolve that issue. \nI then had to use ifup to find out that the /etc/network/interfaces file had been generated with an extra carriage return on the 2nd line and thus was causing the network device to fail on start (line 2 was supposed to be on the end of line 1 behind the comments).\nI tried doing a fresh install, and again the /etc/network/interfaces file had an automatic return on it. Removed that and everything functioned correctly after that. Was able to set a static IP and have it start correctly. I changed the name of em1 to eth0 after that, but I did resolve my issue by removing that carriage return.\n\nA: If you're trying to change interface name, it's not the /etc/network/interfaces you've to change but /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules.

I am studying for a class on System and Network Engineering and in one material we are told that Ubuntu uses the OS loader to load the bootloader GRUB.\nMy question is what is the Ubuntu OS loader and where does it reside?\n\nA: I assume we are talking about a system using a BIOS system. Nowadays we also have UEFI where things are a bit more complicated. The booting (link has more detailed information)  process has 4 stages:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS\n\n\n*\n\n*(U)EFI is another form of kind of firmware. BIOS is found mainly on IBM based systems. EFI is from INTEL and UEFI is supported by a wide range of companies (including Redhat, AMD, nVidia, Intel, Microsoft). If you want detailed difference between the two this website explains it very nicely.\n\n\nWhen a computer is started it starts by executing firmware. In IBM PC compatible systems this is the BIOS and is (mostly) stored on a read only memory module. This will initialise all hardware expect for the CPU and ends with starting the boot loader. \n\n*Boot loader Answer to 1st part\nThe boot loader can be activated from several locations.\n\n\n*\n\n*Master Boot record (The master boot record is the first sector on a disk and contains in general a partition table for the disk and a simple boot loader Answer to 2nd part). GRUB (currently default on Ubuntu) and LILO (used to be the Linux default) are examples of this. \n\n*A CD, DVD or USB.\n\n*A network location.\n\n\nAt the end of the bootloader section it will start the kernel. The kernel picked for this can be a manual choice or an automated choice (last booted kernel, 1st one on the list etc).\n\n*Kernel \n\n\n*\n\n*This is the same for all Linux systems though any Linux can use different modules.\n\n\nThe kernel is the core of all of our Linux systems and provides access to hardware (by loading modules),  load ram disks and several other low level tasks so the system startup can begin.\n\n*System startup \n\n\n*\n\n*this will be different for Redhat, SUSE, Debian/Ubuntu (etc.) and also different for kde, gnome, unity (etc.)\n\n\nFirst the root partition and filesystem are located, checked and mounted. Next the init process is started, which runs the initialization scripts. These scripts involve different /etc/rc scripts and upstart events that eventually gives you a ready-to-use computer with a login screen. \n\nA: The OS loader is Grub. Grub is more than just a bootloader.\nBy Default:\nFor BIOS computers it's stored in the drive's master boot record on MBR partition tables, and the drive's protected master boot record on GUID partition tables.\nFor UEFI/EFI computers it's stored on the EFI System Partition.\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Proposal For A New Tag & Synonym Tags To Help Prevent Misuse Of The Bootloader Tag?\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Booting\n", "Q: Kubuntu Root Password I've been running Kubuntu for about a month now, still learning.  All of a sudden as of about two days ago, if I try to install or update software using Muon, it asks for the root password.  I'm assuming this is my administrative password, but that password won't work.  I know I'm typing it in correctly (case sensitive) and I haven't forgotten my admin password because I can log in to my laptop when I first turn it on using the same password.\nIf the administrative password is not the root password, then what is the root password?  I followed some directions online regarding booting in safe mode, but i can't get the passwd command to work.  I tried that twice and I keep getting an error message telling the password was not changed.  Then I don't know how to exit out of safe mode.  I kept hitting the escape key and that didn't work.

I suspect that this could be due to tools depending on node, when the actual command on Ubuntu is nodejs, which is why creating a symlink should work.  It worked for me in my quick test in a virtual machine, but since it didn't work for you, let's try something else...\nSo, install Node.JS a different way\nI generally prefer to install Node on Ubuntu using NVM.  This avoids the issue of the node command not being defined on Ubuntu, and it avoids the permissions mess that requires using sudo to install npm modules.\nDo the following to get back to a clean slate:\nRemove any global modules you've installed with npm (instructions here):\nsudo npm list -g --depth=0. | awk -F ' ' '{print $2}' | awk -F '@' '{print $1}'  | sudo xargs npm remove -g\n\nRemove symlinked node folder:\nsudo rm /usr/bin/node\n\nUninstall the copies of nodejs and npm that you installed through Ubuntu's repositories:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nodejs npm\n\nClean up any other cruft:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAt this point, which node, which nodejs, which npm, and which jshint should all return nothing.\nReinstall Node, skipping the official repositories\nGrab the latest copy of NVM (you may need to sudo apt-get install curl first):\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.15.0/install.sh | bash\n\nTell your shell to use nvm\nsource ~/.nvm/nvm.sh\n\nThen install a node version\nnvm install 0.12 # or whatever the latest version is\n\nAnd tell nvm which version of Node you want to use\nnvm use 0.12\n\nNow you should be able to run Node with the node command, you should be able to install modules globally without sudo, and you should end up with a working copy of jshint.\nIf you don't want to run nvm use v0.12 every time you start a new terminal session, you can add nvm use v to your ~/.bashrc. The v isn't special, it will just match v* and find the latest version. Alternatively you could hard-code a specific version.\n", "Q: Working SQL client I managed to get working Apache and everything's fine.\nGot MySQL running, which is nice.

And I plan to install Ubuntu on this system that uses them.\nNow all the info that I have found in here about similar problems, are usually with limited SSD space, but mine is pretty big. It is a Samsung 840 Pro 128 GB.\nSo my question is, what would be the intelligent way of partitioning my system in this case? \nObviously the / will go on SSD. Then /home and /swap will go on HDD. But what else? Should I care about \"/tmp\" and \"/var\" also and move them on my HDD? How much size would it be smart to allocate for them then?\n\nA: I have a 128GB SSD. I have 20 GB for / which I really need (running both Gnome and Unity and a bunch of games, several db servers, etc.)\nIn your case I would put both / and /home on the SSD, but I would put the individual large folders as projects, videos, and pictures on the HDD. \nThe advantage of keeping all your documents on the SSD is that they open in under a second. Very nice.\nEdit: If you actually make a /home/media and put that on the HDD then you can configure it so that all the users of your computer (apart from guest) can access it. That comes in very handy.\n\nA: I'm running a similar system at home. I've got a 256 GB SSD with ~ 90 GB allocated to linux. Even with a 15 GB game on the SSD, I've still got a lot of space left over. So basically, you probably don't need /home to be on a separate HDD.\n/tmp you can likely just leave on your SSD without giving it its own partition. /tmp is cleared on every reboot. Giving it its own partition with a fixed size just opens yourself up to not have enough space to open a file in tmp with little to no benefit.\nI can't really speak to /var, but this question on the Unix stack exchange  may help you make the decision.\n", "Q: .desktop file doesn't execute a script, works fine when run by hand I am having problems with my .desktop files.

I have a friend that's running Debian and his computer login password is different from the superuser password. I was wondering if there's a way to do this in Ubuntu?   \n\nA: Technically, they are already different, only the root account is disabled. That's really the difference. Ubuntu has a rather strong stance on this subject, and they insist sudo is the way to go, rather than having a separate root account. So they disable it.\nIf you really want to have a root account like Debian, it's quite easy:\nsudo -i\nsudo passwd root\n\nand then set a password. This will be the password you use when you do su.\nIf you want to go crazy with it, you might be inclined to remove yourself from the sudo group with:\nsudo deluser username sudo\n\nPlease make sure you understand the implications of these changes.

I'm running with Ubuntu 14.04 on a Power8 server.    \nIs there a way to tell how fast the processors are running?\nHow do I enable the tools that come with powerpc-utils and cpufreq ?\nadded....\nppc64_cpu reports\n# ppc64_cpu --frequency\nmin:    3.693 GHz (cpu 159)\nmax:    3.693 GHz (cpu 1)\navg:    3.693 GHz\n\nthe output of 'cpufreq-info' shows (example for one core):\nanalyzing CPU 159:\n  driver: powernv-cpufreq\n  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159\n  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159\n  maximum transition latency: 4294.55 ms.\n  hardware limits: 2.06 GHz - 3.69 GHz\n  available frequency steps: 3.69 GHz <clipped>, 2.09 GHz, 2.06 GHz\n  available cpufreq governors: conservative, userspace, powersave, ondemand, performance\n  current policy: frequency should be within 2.06 GHz and 3.69 GHz.\n              The governor \"ondemand\" may decide which speed to use\n              within this range.\n  current CPU frequency is 2.06 GHz (asserted by call to hardware).\n  cpufreq stats: 3.69 GHz:0.66%, 3.66 GHz:0.00%, 3.62 GHz:0.00% <clipped> 2.09 GHz:0.00%, 2.06 GHz:99.34%  (5)\n\nHere we can see the CPU is still clocked at ~2GHz and the governor is \"ondemand\" so nothing has changed. This Ubuntu installation is fully up to date\n\nA: Yes, on Power /proc/cpuinfo shows the static \"nominal\" clock speed. The hardware also provides some frequency steppings above nominal that the cpufreq governors will include by default when running in OPAL firmware mode.\nThe reason 'ppc64_cpu --frequency' is showing different output is because that command reads some hardware counters and generates CPU activity to measure the frequency, therefore typically producing the max frequency of the system since the CPU utilization is increased while running the command. \nThe cpufreq method displays the actual frequency at that point in time, without bumping up the CPU utilization. So if the system is otherwise idle, cpufreq-info will show the lowest scaling frequency. This is the recommended method to check frequency of the host when running KVM guests since the PMU is shared between the host/guest(s) and the 'ppc64_cpu' method uses PMU hardware counters to measure frequency. \n\nA: On the POWER servers, /proc/cpuinfo is the static definition of the clock speed.   The processors can be clocked up with ppc64_cpu command.\nI've heard there are some discrepancies between what ppc64_cpu --frequency is showing and what cpufreq is showing.\nWe'll have to ask for more details here.\n\nA: ppc64_cpu --frequency will be inaccurate if one or more guests are running.\nThis means that using it to measure the frequency on a host with a guest running, or from within a guest, will produce numbers lower than the actual frequency.\nThe reason for this is that ppc64_cpu --frequency runs a process on all online CPU threads for a fixed amount of time, and counts the CPU cycles during that time period using perf. The perf subsystem itself uses the PMU hardware in the CPU. When a guest is scheduled to run, it is given ownership of the PMU, so no cycles will be counted from the host's perspective when the guest is executing. However the wall clock is still running. This means you're counting time without counting the cycles, and hence your lower than expected frequency result.\nThis is true at least as of powerpc-utils 1.2.22. That's not a guarantee that it will change in the future, but keep it in mind in case you're reading this answer many months or years down the track.\n\nA: The two tools I use is HMC performance or PowerVP.

I have already tried chmod to no avail.\nAny help would be great appreciated!\n\nA: You must compile your .cpp file into a binary file, chmod +x the resulting binary file, then run the compiled binary. You can do this easily with the following syntax:\ng++ <cpp file> -o <resulting binary file>\n\ni.e. the following for your particular program:\ng++ conversion.cpp -o conversion\n\nExample:\nmgodby@mg-ws1:~/code$ g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld\nmgodby@mg-ws1:~/code$ ls\nhelloworld  helloworld.cpp\nmgodby@mg-ws1:~/code$ chmod +x helloworld\nmgodby@mg-ws1:~/code$ ./helloworld \nHello World!\nmgodby@mg-ws1:~/code$\n\nNote 1: If your compile fails for some reason, make sure that all necessary packages are installed -\nsudo apt-get -y install g++\n\nNote 2: You must re-compile, i.e. run the g++ command again, every time you make a change to the original .cpp file, else the changes you make will not take effect.\n\nThe reason that you cannot run your .cpp file directly is that c++ is a \"compiled\" language and not a \"scripting\" or \"interpreted\" language.

I am about to set up a pc with ubuntu server 14.04.1. I want to assign it a static ip address. How can I find a valid IP address that is not already being used? Is there a way to do that from terminal?\n\nA: You can only tell by looking at the router's list of assigned IP addresses. But the best way to accomplish this is to assign a fixed address from the router, not the computer.  That way, the computer will get a fixed address via dhcp without messing with the configuration at all, and without worrying about a conflict if the router assigns that address to another device first.\nThere's no easy way for the Ubuntu client to know what other IP addresses have been assigned on the network.\n\nA: You can find the IP addresses of devices currently connected to your local network by doing\nsudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet\n\nif your current machine is using the wired connection eth0 interface (use ifconfig to see what your interface name is). These will of course change if you have dynamic addressing on those machines. On my server I just picked something well out of the range where most of the other addresses were (e.g. my gateway is 10.0.0.1 and I chose 10.0.0.120).\n", "Q: I cannot enter data in KOrganizer I just installed KOrganizer 4.8.5.

Which leads to a few possible answers to your issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's an issue with the Logisim application itself. Maybe it's not compatible with a Linux operating system, or maybe it's not compatible with your version of java....\n\n*The program needs to be run with elevated privileges (doubtful) or be run in a location where it can write to (more likely). Try making a folder for it somewhere in your home directory and running it within that directory\n\n*It's an issue with the version of java you're using. Some java apps cannot use the open-jdk, and must instead use the oracle jdk. Typing java -version into console should tell you what version of java you have. If you have openjdk installed you can remove it and install oracle jdk by doing the following:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge openjdk*\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\n\n(replace the 7 in that last line with 6 or 8 if you'd rather have those versions). \nYou may also need to downgrade your version of java, which you can do by downloading one of the old versions from this page.\n", "Q: How Can I define machine when I try to add units on JUJU web interface?

I guess that it is somehow picking up the wrong Py_Initialize file.  How do I correct this since I need python 2.7 for the class?\n\nA: Removing the export PYTHONPATH from my .bashrc has fixed the problem.  I now get the normal processing if I type in an incorrect command name.  I will have to do some more research to be sure that my python 2.7 code is picking up the correct modules without that extra environment setting.\n\nA: When using Python, avoid placing Python-specific configuration into your shell env directly. Instead, specify Python paths, variables, etc inside the Python scripts you write and even then, only when needed.\nThe reason for this is that it allows each Python script or program to call Python its own way without interfering with or generally inhibiting the functionality of other python scripts and programs. In this particular case, you were specifying a Python 2.7 path for your bash shell to use universally and in doing so, broke any programs that rely on a different Python environment variable ( Python 3 in this case) yet do not specify those variables explicitly.\nSpecifying which version of Python to use at the beginning of a Python script will implictly set the correct default paths for the program to work, nullifying the need for explicit Python environment variables such as the ones you had set in your .bashrcexport file. You can do this by making the first line in your Python scripts something like this:\n#!/usr/bin/python2\nConversely, you can specify Python 3 to be used when running a script with thise line as the first line in your script:\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nYou can take this a step further by specifying exact Python versions if you so desire, I.e. :\n#!/usr/bin/python2.7\nor\n#!/usr/bin/python3.4\n\nA: I confirm.\nThis happens on system with anaconda working fine, when upgrading from ubuntu 17.4 to 17.10, where system now uses Python3.6. \nunset PYTHONHOME made it work directly. \nSo I removed from my .bashrc this addition during anaconda install:\nexport PATH=/opt/anaconda/bin:$PATH\nexport PYTHONHOME=/opt/anaconda/\n\nBeside, the default python is still python2, not anaconda distrib, but I can still switch to my python env with python2.7,\n$  source activate myenv\n\nor run the /opt/anaconda/python2, so that works fine, it is only  that is now python3\nThis system depend PYTHONHOME is not robust to nominal env changes, which is bad in my opinion, and not documented about anaconda install, although workaround is easy. \nnge\n", "Q: Wordpress / Apache Permissions I have Apache and wordpress installed on my ubuntu,\neverytime I try to upload a widget or anything,\nI get an error...\nTried using..\n$ sudo chmod 777 /var/www*\n\nbut still nothing..\nAny Advice? \n\nUnable to create directory wp-content/uploads/2014/09.

Assigning proper permissions for www-data can solve the problem.\nTry this :\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your/directory/\n\nin your case - \nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/\n\nI was using nginx on ubuntu 14.04 , I hope this works for apache too.\nand chmod 777 is dangerous ,avoid it.\n\nA: *\n\n*Never ever do ...\nsudo chmod 777 /var/www*\n\nIt is a security risk. Basically you include \"the outside world\" (3rd 7) to have access to that directory. Make sure to restore the permissions to 775 for directories and 664 for files.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the directories you have set up from /var/www/ and deeper to be owned by the user and the group set in apache.\n\n*If they are different: add the user you set up in Apache to the same group as the user that needs to create the files from wordpress.\nThat way you will have permisions to create files without the whole world capable of putting files onn your system.\n\nThe command to add a user to an existing group is\nusermod -a -G {group} {user}\n\n\nRegarding wp-content/uploads/2014/09: \n\n\n*\n\n*Are you sure it is this and not ./wp-content/uploads/2014/09.

One thing I really liked about Unity is that the titlebar and buttons for windows were in the top panel, I was wondering if I could have that same effect in Cinnamon?\n\nA: No, this cannot be done with Cinnamon, at least not without a great amount of coding.\nCinnamon is a completely different desktop manager than Unity. A feature of Unity is that the application menu is included into the Panel. Cinnamon does not provide this feature. In Cinnamon, the Panel acts like the Panel in e.g. Windows 7.\n\nA: As you know now there is difficult create in cinnamon, the same as the ubuntu devs do on unity. Thats is really true, but not impossible on free software. Anyone can reuse the code and put it on another language or platform. And this are actually done, but is increible that the most difficult thing is not write the code and functionalities. The difficult part is found how be compatible with other sessions and programs, when you try to do a similar things or/and functionality. The Appmenu (global menu) is an example of what occurs. Duplicate the modules, could cause conflict and will be for do the same. Reuse the current code is the most sane thing, because on my opinion is also a contribution to the same distro (in that case ubuntu), but well. The Appmenu need a patch for some subset of applications and this patch is private to the session (unity). \nAs another example, recently was renamed a package that was developed by ubuntu, but also was used on other ubuntu sessions and also on others distros. Now is called unity-gtk-module and have a patch to only be active on unity session, because it may cause problems with other sessions. The appmenu also need patch the gnome settings daemon to call dinamically some gtk properties. Again this ofcourse only occurs for unity session and can not be modify without create a duplication of the patch, and again with conflicts. Is possible and is the best, share ways to turn on/off the things. There are also mechanisms to do that actually but apparently not for all people and things... This is the history of the appmenu, but this not begin with unity or ubuntu (It was ubuntu, who put order into the gtk chaos).

I am very new to Linux distros and have been tinkering around. I'm currently using Cinnamon after a few weeks on Ubuntu's Unity. I really like Unity and I'm not too fond of Cinnamon, but I like the customization Cinnamon offers, the only thing is the one feature I really like, the top panel acting as a menubar, is not in Cinnamon and apparently can't be.\nIt's a really petty reason to drop an OS, but I also prefer Unity's software store. I was wondering if there's a distro that has Unity's overall look and feel, but offers the customization that Cinnamon has? \n\nA: I recently switched to LXLE (a.k.a. LXDE Luxury Edition) and am really enjoying it.  It's fast and highly configurable.  Plus, it's got a great number (and variety) of packages pre-installed.  It's currently running on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but you can easily upgrade to 14.04.1 LTS after installing by changing the software sources 'Notify me of a new Ubuntu version' to 'For long-term support versions'.\n\nA: Definitely try out other desktop environments like the others are saying, but I highly recommend not passing judgment on Unity's customization options until you install both Ubuntu Tweak and Unity Tweak Tool and run them to see a myriad of ways in which you can customize Unity.\nWebsites for these:\nhttp://ubuntu-tweak.com/downloads/\nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/unity-tweak-tool/\n\nAdditionaly, consider installing and using optional Unity panel indicators as demonstrated in this How To Geek article:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/118908/10-awesome-indicator-applets-for-ubuntus-unity-desktop/\n", "Q: MAAS Node not PXE Booting I'm having an issue so far with getting my first node to boot... it connects to the MAAS Server and begins the boot procedure but then hangs because it is unable to find the correct kernel image boot.

I am really not getting what is happening underneath in all 3 commands stated above. I know & is used for making a process a background process, but I am not getting the logic. I am new to this flavor please Can someone explain this?\n\nA: Your confusion may be because >& is totally a different thing than &.\n>& or <& are used in redirection to point at a file descriptor (fd).  The above cases redirect to 1 and 2, which are stdout and stderr respectively.\n> means \"redirect stdout\"\n2> means \"redirect fd 2 (stderr)\"\n>&2 means \"redirect stdout to fd 2 (stderr)\".  Note how this differs from >2 which would mean \"redirect stdout to a file named 2\" -- this is why the & is important.  It indicates that the next thing will be an fd, not a filename.\nNow of course as you noted, if a & is sitting by itself without a redirection symbol, then it means something completely different -- \"return immediately, run the preceding command in the background.\"\n", "Q: Properly installing Cisco Secure Mobility Client on xUbuntu 14.04.1 I was following the steps documented here: https://faq.oit.gatech.edu/content/how-do-i-install-cisco-anyconnect-client-linux\nAccording to what I found: http://rbgeek.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/cisco-anyconnect-vpn-client-installation-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts/\nIt seems like the ia32-libs is needed to successfully install the Cisco AnyConnect.

I can't remove it because Skype will not work without it (as far as I'm aware) and only show virtual devices in the Audio options. It is only showing dummy output devices and no input devices despite having a built-in microphone. Is there any way to fix this, or better yet is there any way to use Skype without PulseAudio?\n\nA: It is possible that PulseAudio hasn't been initialized fully. Try pulseaudio -k followed by pulseaudio --start. If this still doesn't help, try to restart your system and then check if Skype detects PA correctly. \nIf it still doesn't work, please provide more info on what you tried (and what failed) in the original question.

The root of my problem is that 'more' seems to quit when it is piped to another program, e.g.\necho -e \"this\\nis\\na\\ntest\" | more -3 | cat\n\nThis will print 4 lines, though if we trim the '| cat' at the end, then it will pause after printing 3 lines, as expected.\nAdmittedly, using 'less' instead of 'more' does work, though this doesn't have the desired effect as it opens a seperate \"window\" and doesn't allow scroll back once it is completed (I don't need the ability to scroll backwards in the way that 'less' allows either).\nMy current solution is to use 'head' and 'tail' commands to get the effect I want, but there are some other challenges to face their as well.\nDoes anyone know the secret to make 'more' work in the way I envisioned? Suggestions for another paging tool that is simpler (supports Enter, space, and 'q' actions) are also welcome.\nThank you!\n\nA: It seems that using tee to redirect to a file and paging stdout would be more appropriate than paging in the middle of a pipeline:\nprintf \"%s\\n\" this is a test | tee /tmp/some.file | more -3\n\n", "Q: What is the recommended way to download Ubuntu new releases ISO? Torrent or official mirror? I want to download the ISO file of the new release of Ubuntu.  What is the recommended way to get it?  Via torrent or official mirror?\n\nA: Torrents are a great way to go if you are on a home network and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) does not throttle the service when torrent clients are running (My parents had a wireless ISP that did this; most DSL or Cable services will not). Some Linux/UNIX distro maintainers (I.e. Arch Linux) actually recommend that you download via torrent if possible. This is because your total download speeds will be faster due to the nature of torrents. There is also the additional community benefit of lightening the load on official mirrors.\nThe important part is to make sure that you download the torrent itself from the distribution's official Web site to ensure that you will be downloading a legitimate copy.\nIf you are not at a private residence or if the ISP where you are does not allow torrenting, mirror downloads will work just fine too.\n\nA: Speed\nWhen the ISO that want to download has been released a couple of days ago there will be a bunch of people trying to get it from the official server. That is when it's recommended to use a torrent channel, because you're not relaying in only one server your download will be faster than the official server.\nSecurity\nNone of them is more \"safe\" than the other one, you should still guarantee the file's integrity.

Once it boots into the trial session, then you can access partitions on your hard drives and repair things.  \n\nA: When making USB bootable don't forget to set aside separate space for saving files and settings.\nBoth unetbootin in Windows and USb Creator in Ubuntu allow this, but I think at least 4 gb USb is necessary.\nOtherwise you can't save changes in Live USB.  \n\nA: You can use unetbootin to create your USB drive so that you can set a space used to preserve files across reboots\nIf you don't know any idea what that is, then you can set 1024 meaning 1 gigabytes for extra space to make room for you to play around. \nLong story short, if you have a USB disk more than 2 GBs you can set this 1024. If not, try 100 or some value that can fit into the USB along with the Ubuntu installation (fairly 800 MB sth). \n", "Q: Ubuntu and ASUS G750JM, GTX860M / Nvidia problems This is my second thread, the other is on another website but that one is going no where and I don't think it gets enough attention so I'm posting here. \nHas anyone gotten drivers to work the GTX860M in Ubuntu 14.04?

Installing Ubuntu BROKE my (since-repaired) Fusion Drive.\nI burned ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64+mac.iso to a DVD, and booted it and I asked it to install beside my OSX install on my homemade* Fusion Drive on my MacBookPro4,1.  \nInstead, it created a Linux swap partition (disk0s5), a non-bootable (even via rEFInd) partition (disk0s4) of the new new Linux filesystem data partition type, and made my OSX install NON-BOOTABLE by CHANGING the partition type  of half of my fusion drive to FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF.  I revived my system by changing the partition type back to Apple CoreStorage\nI can find nothing in the Release Notes Change Summary for 14.04.1 to suggest a better result is likely due to a bug fix in .1.\nSo, any tips for how to make rEFInd boot the Ubuntu install on my disk0s4?  (Or otherwise get Ubuntu installed safely beside my existing OSX Fusion Drive?)  TIA.\nI already tried creating /EFI/refind/drivers_x64/ and putting ext2_x64.efi in it.\nMy refind.conf is still in the default config.  I can't mount disk0s4.\n--\n*My homemade Fusion Drive has been working well for many months; yes it really works; I get the speedup and it keeps 4GB free on the SSD and moves stuff, as shown by iostat -w9.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS works fine on a fusion drive. However, make sure you partition the drive using the installer and do not use the Mac version of the Ubuntu ISO. The regular version supports EFI booting which also negates the need for rEFInd. \nBy installing in EFI mode, Ubuntu will be available as a boot option by holding down the Option key on startup. Also, do not add any additional partitions for example, SWAP. Only create one system partition for Ubuntu since Fusion drives only support one additional partition.\nHere's a short clip showing Ubuntu being selected on startup on my MacBook Pro without rEFInd and natively booting via EFI:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0RM3L8r4cE\n", "Q: Installing Windows in Ubuntu installed hard disk partition I was trying install windows on my Ubuntu laptop,I have only one disk partition on which i have istalled ubuntu,While trying to installing windows I got an error that \"Windows cannot be installed in this drive,Windows supports only NTFS file system,How can I install windows in an ubuntu ext3 file system?\n\nA: You will need to use the GParted partition editor to shrink your Ubuntu partiton.\nTo install GParted, use...\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n\nAfterwards, install Windows in the free space you created.\n", "Q: && command string question So I was wondering if it would be possible to run the command:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo pm-suspend\n\nAs you can probably work out for yourself, I wish to update software when I go to bed, but have it suspend once it is done?\nI would try it, but putting it bluntly, I'm afraid of breaking something.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You're going to have to type in your root password when you hit enter, but assuming sudo pm-suspend runs without errors normally, this will run just fine.\nI suggest you run sudo apt-get -y upgrade so you don't have to go through the confirmation of the packages after it finishes with sudo apt-get update\n", "Q: What Happened to `Recent Files' Feature in Document Viewer (Evince)? Most of the currently available applications provide a way to open the recently accessed files from it.\nIn the previous versions of Document Viewer, I could see a list of recently opened files. However, in recent versions of Document Viewer, I find that this previously available feature is no longer present.\nWhen you use the File menu after launching Document Viewer, there is no list of recent files.\n\nWhen you click on Open, the Recently Used entry, available by default in other Ubuntu applications is not there.\n\nOnly after you have opened a file, and click on File->Open, you can get a list of recent files.\n\nI feel that a very useful feature has been withdrawn.

I have a pc running Ubuntu server 14.04.1. The internet was set up using DHCP I believe.

Suddenly stopped working.

Under Settings>Printers>Policies \"Enabled\" was not selected. Why is this even an option?? Of all the features that used to make Ubuntu a good operating system have been stripped away, this one remains?? Unreal.\n\nA: Under Ubuntu 16.04 the same problem occurred, on my networked (wireless) HP 4635, in the same way: suddenly, without the user doing anything, and for no obvious reason. It was resolved in about the same way: click the Settings icon (gear), click System Settings, open Printers, right-click the printer, click \"Enabled\" in the printer's context menu to check-mark \"Enabled\".  (If \"Enabled\" was already check-marked, this isn't your solution.) \n\nA: Update to Donnie's answer:\nFor non-GUI CUPS user, you can adjust this setting in your CUPS web interface.\nAdministration => Manage Printers => Select your printer => Maintaince => Resume Printer.\nIt's really strange that, a single printing failure causes CUPS to prevent any further printing job. Bad design .\n\nA: The print jobs stay in pending state, when the printer is \"disabled\", as the other answers suggest. However I also noticed the checkbox gets re-enabled when the issues disappear.\nIn my case, the daemon cups-browsed got stuck, and restarting it using\nsystemctl restart cups-browsed\nhelped resolve the issue, and the print job resumed immediately.\n", "Q: Guides to download videos with wget don't work I know this is somewhat of a duplicate question, but all the others I've seen answered never really answered the question, \"how to I download videos using wget?\" All of the previous answers just seem to suggest other means to download the videos, like youtube-dl. \nI'm interested how to use wget specifically though. It looks like a handy tool to use, but every guide I've found gives directions that don't work, and every question answered on multiple forums just avoids the question and suggests alternatives.\nI've found these two guides: http://go2linux.garron.me/wget-to-download-youtube-videos & http://www.marksanborn.net/howto/using-wget-to-download-youtube-videos/\nThe first works up until the last step where I get a 404 error. I would give the exact error but for some reason I can't even get the second step to work today?? Following the second guide, only the first step works so I don't even know if it's useful. \nI know there are plenty of great plugins and programs available, but if anyone knows how to use wget I would appreciate any insight. \n\nA: If you have the URL of a YouTube video, you can download it just normally with wget. Even the continue option -c works.\nThe problem is to get the URL.\nThe URL is part of the inner workings of the YouTube system software. \nIt is generated by one system component, and used by another - not intended to be used anywhere else.\nYou need to know how to find this URL. The problem is that the way to get the URL can cange if something in the system changes.\nThen, you need updated instructions.\nLooking at your links, these instructions are from 2007 and 2008. Since then, it may have changed hundreds of times - no wonder it does not work.\nI see two ways to get up to date information on how it currently works to get the URLs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Learn how to do it yourself.\n\n*Find someone who updates a description about it when there are changes.\n\n\nI would guess the most up-to-date descriptions are used be youtube-dl or something similar. \nTo use them without using youtube-dl, you need to look at the source code of youtube-dl, and then rebuild youtube-dl yourself with wget. That should be possible for sure.\n", "Q: difficulty booting ubuntu from usb Hi I am trying to run ubuntu alongside win8.1 but i am having difficulty getting ubuntu to boot from my USB, I have had no problems with installing ubuntu on my other computers via USB but whenever I try to boot from the USB with my main computer, I get a purple screen with a image at the bottom (sometimes).

When you download a file from the Internet, you're grabbing the data which is inside the file.\nWhat you're not getting is the permissions which are applied to the file.  That's done on your local filesystem.\nTo make a file executable on your local system, drop into a terminal and run\nchmod +x filename.sh\n\nThat tells your filesystem to treat that particular file as executable.\nThere's a good reason for this.  Suppose that you were to download a file which had permissions allowing anyone on your computer to run it.  That's a clear security risk.\n", "Q: Can I lock a folder so NOBODY can delete it? I would like to create a folder in my OPT directory on Ubuntu 14.04. However, it must have the following requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can not be deleted by ANYONE, even root.\n\n*ReadOnly access to ALL users (except nobody)\n\n*Write access ONLY by my user (test-user). Root shouldn't be able to write.\n\n\nA: Following is possible:\nIf you have directory named dir1 then use chattr as follows:\nsudo chattr +i dir1\n\nFrom man chattr:\n\nA file with the `i' attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be deleted or renamed, no link can be created  to  this  file.\n\nNow If any user even with sudo/root! try to delete this directory by CLI or GUI, it gives error: Operation not permitted.\nIt is required to remove i attribute (which can be only done by root) as following command to give back rights to dir1:\nsudo chattr -i dir1.\n\nFor any other case such as rwx permission and ownership can be applied by chown and chmod commands. \nBut wite-access by test-user and can't be deleted by even root at same time, seems not possible!\n\nA: \nCan not be deleted by ANYONE, even root.\n\nNope. root can always remount the disk or (better) remove any restrictions you put into place. \n\nReadOnly access to ALL users (except nobody)\n\nSee 3.\n\nWrite access ONLY by my user (test-user). Root shouldn't be able to write.\n\nNope. root can always remove any restrictions you put into place. You can mount (example: //youserver/sharename /mnt/mountpoint cifs username=yourusername,password=yourpassword,file_mode=0664,dir_mode=0775) a partition for a user but not block root access. \n\nroot can always (and has to always be able to) change anything that can form any sort of restriction. Otherwise you can end up with an unusable system that can only be formatted to get it working again. \nIf you have a root user that you do not trust then change the password and force them of the system. Otherwise this is moot: you will have to trust your admin. \n", "Q: What data will be lost during upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to 14.04?

I can't tell it from here, it's a matter of testing. Something may depend on a function that is not available anymore, and it will break. \n\n*Backup folders and files in /etc where config files for Apache etc are located. You can backup the entire /etc folder as it's probably not too big. You need to be root to do this. Do this with tar, and be sure to preserve rights and ownership. \n\n*Cron jobs should stay the same, back them up if you're not sure.\n\n\nThe upgrade program may ask you what to do with the Apache config file(s): overwrite, keep?

That is to say if we have three files (a, b and c) in a directory ls * is actually running ls a b c.\nWhen Bash can't expand, it passes through the raw string¹. That's why you see the wildcards in the error, along with a not found message. ls tried to show the listing for a file literally called *.bash*.\nSo why didn't that expand? Well by default globbing (what this wildcard expansion is called) won't return hidden files. You can change this with shopt -s dotglob (that won't persist unless you stick it in your .bashrc — it might be disabled by default for a good reason so be careful with it), here's a quick demo:\n$ ls  *.bash*\nls: cannot access *.bash*: No such file or directory\n$ shopt -s dotglob\n$ ls  *.bash*\n.bash_aliases  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .bashrc.save\n\nThe exception to this is —as you've already shown— when you've already explicitly stated the files will be hidden with a pattern like .bash*. It simply overrides the default dotglob setting:\n$ shopt -u dotglob  # unset dotglob\n$ ls .bash*\n.bash_aliases  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .bashrc.save\n\nAnyway besides that quirk, I hope this helps you understand what's going on under the surface.\n\nThere are other shopt flags that alter how globbing works: extglob, failglob,  globstar, nocaseglob and nullglob. They and a raft of other shopt flags are  documented as part of the Bash manual.\nSimilarly, the page on Pattern Matching should make for some good reading.\n¹ Unless failglob or nullglob are set.\n", "Q: No wireless after ugrade from 11.10 to 12.04 Finally upgraded to 12.04 LTS on a Dell 630 Latitude and the wireless stopped working after reboot.\nHave tried to install STA, b43 even NDISwrapper in various ways due to crappy slow internet and it's still not working.

However I can't get any of the following back-ends to work:\nGTKAgg (requires python(3)-gtk2)\nGTK3AGG (gtk3Agg backend is not known to work on Python 3.x.)\nGTK3Cairo (no window opens)\nQT4AGG (requires QT4 which is not installed on my system).\n\nI have installed the following packages: \npython3 python3-matplotlib ipython3 python3-cairo python3-gi \n\nI have also tried installing python3-gtk2 but that returns this error:\n\nPackage python3-gtk2 is not available, but is referred to by another\n  package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been\n  obsoleted, or is only available from another source\n\nWhich I'm guessing means that I'm not supposed to use it on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nChoosing GTK3Cairo as a backend throws no errors and imports fine using ipython3 and pylabs; but, it also doesn't open a new window when I call the plot() function.\nIs there really nothing else that I can use besides tkinter?\n\nA: I had the same problem on arch.

I installed gdebi through the Ubuntu Software Center.\nThe XP-301 driver is here as a .deb file: http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/du/02/DriverDownloadInfo.do?LG2=EN&CN2=&DSCMI=22524&DSCCHK=be2881cd731a22e340ed2e96eb71ee0725faab96#\nI downloaded the driver then accessed the driver file though \"Files\". Next, I right-clicked on the *.deb driver file . I chose \"open with gdebi\". This installed the driver without a problem.\nThen I went to \"System Settings\", \"Printer\", and was able to add the printer as a network printer. I used the LPD/LPR with the PASSTHRU queue option. Printing and Scanning now both work fine.\n", "Q: You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of \"folder\" I had Windows installed before and I downloaded some files while using it.Then I installed Backtrack 5 R3 as dual boot and copied the files on windows to BT when BT was booted, and it was successful. (Also I always logged in as root on BT) Then I deleted Windows and installed Ubuntu 14.04 as dual boot and copied the files on BT to Ubuntu. \nThe problem is that when I want to open or access the files on Ubuntu when Ubuntu is booted, i can't; I get the error message \nYou do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of “files”\n\nI can however use the ls command with sudo to sudo ls files but can't use cd; when I try I get sudo: cd: command not found. \nThe way I found that worked was to log in as root on terminal and open/access the files that way. But it wasn't efficient; I still couldn't open the files via graphical file manager. Then I looked it up on many threads and only thing i found that worked was sudo chmod go+rx files but the problem with this is that it makes only the files folder accessible, not the subfolders, and if I try using the same command to the subfolders one by one it works but I've got hundreds of subfolders which also have subfolders in them.\nSo I'm asking if there's a more practical way of doing it.\n\nA: Just add the -R option to recursively change all the permissions of each files and directories under a specified directory. An example, recursively add read and write permissions for the owner and group on foldername:\nsudo chmod -R ug+rw foldername\n\nRead more about permissions ...\n\nA: Instead of giving the whole directory structure insecure permissions that allow any user to write whatever they like to any file in it, make yourself the owner (recursively, using the -R flag):\nsudo chown -R $USER: files\n\nThere's probably no need for chmod at all, but if you still have problems, check that the owner does have read, write and execute permissions on the directories, and read and write permissions on the files, by using find from the parent directory:\nfind files -type d ! -perm -u=rwx\n\nIf you find something, add an -exec to change the mode:\nfind files -type d ! -perm -u=rwx -exec chmod u+rwx {} +\n\nThen for the regular files:\nfind files -type f ! -perm -u=rw\n\nIf you find something:\nfind -type f ! -perm -u=rw -exec chmod u+rw {} +    \n\nThis is arguably better than using the -R flag with chmod because we don't want to give files and directories the same permissions.\n\nA: If you install the nautilus-admin addon from the repositories you can open (right click) any file or folder and change the permissions in the Properties tab.\nIt's a GUI solution to the problem for those who prefer it.\n", "Q: Change content of a file from the terminal How can I change the content of a file from the terminal? I do not want to use any application like a text editor, since I want to use it for a script.\nTo give an example, I want to turn the file /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf from this\n<IfModule mod_dir.c>\n    DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm\n</IfModule>\n\nto this\n<IfModule mod_dir.c>\n    DirectoryIndex index.php\n</IfModule>\n\n\nA: You could use\necho content > file\n\nor if it's really static, have an extra copy of the file and cp it.\n\nA: There are many ways to do this, depending whether you want to rearrange fields on that second line or just set it to exactly what you want. Here is the simplest way to do it:\nsed -i.bak -e 's/DirectoryIndex.*/DirectoryIndex index.php/' dir.conf\n\nThis will change the DirectoryIndex line, including everything after that word, to DirectoryIndex index.php. The -i.bak saves a backup copy of the original file in dir.conf.bak. After running this, we have:\n$ cat dir.conf\n<IfModule mod_dir.c>\n    DirectoryIndex index.php\n</IfModule>\n\n$ cat dir.conf.bak\n<IfModule mod_dir.c>\n    DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm\n</IfModule>\n\n", "Q: Unity - 14.04 - Set Launcher Icon Size - via command line I've got a few computers, all coming to the end of their life.\nThe first couple have gone and I find myself again having to re-install ubuntu on it's resurrected remains and then laboriously reconfigure everything.\nSo I'm writing a couple of scripts to reconfigure the thing back to how I like it... and install all the core programs I need to work. \nIdeally i'd do Sudo ./install.sh walk away, make some tea and avoid the headache.\nSo far I've got:\n# Turn on workspaces\ngsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ hsize 2\n\n# Turn on hide launcher\ngsettings set org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/ launcher-hide-mode 1\n\nCould anyone advise how I'd auto set launcher icon size to a number (probably 36 in this case) and similarly what the command would be for the auto hide launcher sensitivity.\n\nA: I was able to do this using dconf e.g. to set the launcher icon size to 64 pixels\nCode:\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/icon-size 64\n\nTo reset it to the default value, you can use\nCode:\ndconf reset /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/icon-size\n\nThe dconf command line utility is not installed by default - you need to install the dconf-tools package. Usually there is an equivalent command via gsettings however in this case it appears the required schema definition does not exist.\nSource : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2195187\n\nA: Actually, if you want to copy most/all settings for all gnome-based apps (like gedit, launchers, etc., Unity included) from one account to another, you can use dconf dump / > mysettings.ini and on the target account: dconf load / < mysettings.ini.\nIn addition, you could manually review all the setting in mysettings.ini and adapt them as needed (you'll find there the icon-size and everything else related to Unity).\nIf you can't identify a particular setting by looking through the dump, you could find it by first doing a dump, then changing the setting via the standard UI, then comparing the original dump with a new one, like this:\ndconf dump / > ~/tmp.dump\nchange a setting via the UI\ndiff -B5 <(dconf dump /) ~/tmp.dump\n(-B5 is to additionally get 5 lines before the match, for more context -OR- use dconf watch /)\nThe settings that are dumped with dconf dump / are the values that differ from the defaults, i.e. you won't see there settings that currently have their default values. For a complete list of all available settings with rather complete explanations, possible ranges and default values check the files in /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/. You'll see there 10_xxx.override files, this is the preferred way to override the settings globally.\nAs to the comment by @mauek-unak, compiz settings (like the icon-size) were not working under a VM because the default compiz profile under low graphics is unity-lowgfx, but the setting modified by gsettings set org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/uni‌​tyshell/ icon-size 64 is for the unity profile. The strange thing is that even with dconf dump/load the setting of the current profile gsettings get org.compiz current-profile is not having effect on the actual compiz profile. \nWhen lowgfx is in play, ~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig/config will have some settings and you should change it with something like:\nsed -i '/profile = / s/-lowgfx//g' ~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig/config\nThe change is applied immediately.\n\nA: Actually, when running Ubuntu under VirtualBox, you will need to do:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity lowgfx false\nEditing the config file will only temporarily change it.\n", "Q: Gaming, mouse get crazy when left click I am on kubuntu with an home built computer tower, I have a problem with my mouse, whenever I use the left button and do a small movement, the mouse get totally crazy, it makes in almost (to not say every) games, I tried (minecraft, tf2, cs..).

I am attempting to Dual-boot Ubuntu 14.04LTS onto my HP Envy Touchsmart, model 4-1105dx. I created the partition (I have a GPT-kind partitions table). I've followed every guide I can find about to disable SecureBoot and change my UEFI settings. My computer won't allow me to disable UEFI so I enabled Legacy Boot and still, no matter what I have done, whenever I go to install Ubuntu, when I get to the 'Installer Type' page, I get an empty table and no options to change anything. It does not show me my partitions, doesn't give me any options. Nothing. I'm at my wits end. Am I just missing something or am I doomed to Windows forever?\n\nA: I ran into this same issue recently with dual booting a computer. In my research the best option was to re install windows using legacy boot instead of UEFI, then install Ubuntu alongside windows.\nDisable UEFI in your bios and install windows to your hard drive, erasing the contents of the current drive (back your files up before doing this). When installing windows you have the choice of setting how much disc space to use, you can change this later if you want as well. After windows is installed, insert your Ubuntu cd/usb and select install alongside windows.\nMaybe others will chime in with a solution to your problem, but it was easier for me to do it this way. \nPlus you get rid of UEFI and all the bloatware that came with your machine ;)\n", "Q: twofinger scroll on lenovo g50 I recently switched from windows 8 to Ubuntu 14.04.

If the assertion succeeds, the engine matches the resolution pattern.\nA lookbehind does not \"consume\" any characters on the string. This means that after the closing parenthesis, the regex engine is left standing on the very same spot in the string from which it started looking: it hasn't moved. From that position, then engine can start matching characters again.\nSource: http://www.rexegg.com/regex-disambiguation.html#lookbehind\n\nA: I also tried command line screen capture examples a few weeks ago.

Right now I have a dual boot set up with Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8.1. However, I did some things on Ubuntu that caused some of the packages to become \"inconsistent\", and I tried to fix them but it didn't really work. Rather than try, probably in vain, to fix it, I thought I would just uninstall it, repartition everything and go through the whole installation again, and be more careful not to cause the same errors.\nBut if I simply erase the partitions, I won't be able to boot Windows, and unfortunately I don't have any sort of recovery disk/drive, I searched for hours and I've come to the conclusion that I will have to have Microsoft mail me a recovery disk, it's simply not available online. I do have the recovery partition, however. But the problem is that Windows doesn't seem to be recognizing it as such. If I try to use the wizard to create a recovery drive it tells me there is no recovery partition and that it doesn't have all the required files. In MiniTool Partition Wizard, it is clearly labeled \"Recovery\", and I checked the contents and it has everything it is supposed to have. But Windows doesn't think it exists, at least not as a recovery partition. In the Windows disk manager it is labeled as \"Healthy (OEM Partition)\". Maybe that is what it is supposed to be, but regardless it doesn't let me create any recovery media.\nSo how can I do this? I want to keep Windows just the way it is as far as my files and programs, but basically unpartition the drive and allow Windows to be the only operating system again, as if I never had Ubuntu on there in the first place. I may reinstall Ubuntu afterwards, or try doing it a different way, or try a different Linux OS altogether. But I can't do this unless I restore the partitions and the Windows boot configuration. \nI have an idea but I'm not sure it will work, so I wanted to get some opinions from people who have more experience. If I were to manually copy the recovery partition to an external drive, could I then make it bootable, boot into it without even touching the partitions myself, and use the recovery disk to do all the repartitioning and restoration of Windows configuration by itself, without losing my Windows files, programs and setup? That would be ideal, because if I got stuck not able to boot into Windows it would be a huge problem, especially if the Ubuntu partitions were totally gone. Then I wouldn't even be able to reinstall it and regain the Ubuntu boot configuration, unless I formatted my Windows partition. I don't want to do that.\n\nA: You can use the ubuntu installation disk to do that. You can use the \"Try Ubuntu\" option on the Live CD to back up your files and if you use the \"Install Ubuntu\" it  will recognize your windows and Linux partition and you will have the option to resize and format your partitions.\n", "Q: Saving images of my IP-camera on my Desktop using FTP I have a camera which allows FTP connections.

You'll need to boot a\n  liveCD/USB in order to re-size a system partition, and the Ubuntu\n  14.04.1 LiveCD/USB image comes with GParted.\n\nClick on the partition you wish to expand, then click the orange arrow to expand it. If another partition exists, you may need to delete it.\n\nTo reformat a partition for windows, right click the partition, then choose \"Format\", and use the NTFS file system.\n\nA: Since you can't modify a mounted partition, and can't unmount the partition for the running system, the easiest way would be to boot from the Ubuntu install disk into a live system.  From there, you can run gparted, choose the disk that contains Ubuntu, and resize that partition.\nJust drag the end of the partition toward the beginning (from right to left), leaving space at the end.\nThen, you can create a new partition in the unused space, either with gparted (change type to NTFS or FAT32), or you should be able to use Windows, if you want.\n", "Q: Psensor, audible repeating sound for alert alarm?

When I write C codes in geany and the build and then run the program from there using the buttons there, it works fine. Again I can run the compiled executables using ./file_name command from terminal emulator. But when I double click on the executable from nautilus, nothing happens. I have also checked \"Allow executing the file as a program\" from the properties menu. But the problem still exists.\n\nA: In order to run executable files from nautilus, you just have to double click on them. \nThe reason why you don't see anything is probably because the programs you are making are terminal applications (without a Graphical User Interface) and thus are run on the background, without anywhere to display their output.\nSo, while the program itself is run, you do not see the result of it.\nIf an application has a Graphical User Interface then you will have absolutely no problem in running it by double clicking it.\nWhat I do in order to solve this problem, is download the package nautilus-open-terminal (requires relogin to enable it) which adds a \"open terminal here\" option to nautilus.\nSo, whenever I want to run something from the current directory with doesn't have a GUI, I open a terminal at the current directory and I run it through the terminal.\n\nA: It's most probably printing things on the command-line and that won't show the output when you double-click and run from nautilus. So every time you run the program from nautilus, it is indeed executing, but not showing output since it is not a terminal. \nYou can use the Nautilus Actions Configuration Tool to set running such programs from gnome-terminal. \nIf you're facing problems with getting NACT to run stuff from the gnome-terminal, you might want to refer to this question - \"Run in terminal\" option in Nautilus Actions Configuration Tool doesn't work\n", "Q: how to run an --up script using network-manager-openvpn?

Possibly reinstalling nvidia drivers (purge, then install) after this downgrade might be necessary.\n\nA: It seems to be a problem with Optimus. I tried bumblebee as well as prime without any luck.\nHowever, going into my BIOS and switching from Optimus to Discrete Graphics (only running the nvidia card), the nvidia driver is finally successfully loaded.\nOne question persists: Who or what is messing with the alternatives? It seems to happen everytime I log out. \nIf I switch to the virtual console in the login screen and change the alternatives there, I can log in and they don't change.

This could be solved by switching to text-mode console and back.\nNow, this is not happening again. I noticed, that bbswitch module is now loaded by default on boot, but I had not put bbswitch or nvidia myself in /etc/modules. neither are they found there now. So, I guess this has to do with the heavy work and frequent releases to mesa, mayland, xserver, video-nouveau and video-intel during the last month. Now the new kernel seems to load any bbswitch, nvidia during boot on its own. I hope this is the beginning of a working mainstream mayland and kms system for ubuntu.

It's not a big deal, my terminal works fine, it just annoys me.\n\nA: This problem can occur when .bashrc file (which is a hidden file) is missing or corrupted.

In terminal it's all easy but I want to be able to open it also in nautilus.\nIn terminal my way of doing it looks like this:\nssh myUser@my.server.com\n\nNow that I am connected in there, I can do ssh myUser2.my.server2.com inside of that server to connect to server2.  I canoot connect to server 2 directly. It has to be done like I do it right now.\nSo right now I can only get a connection to the first server in nautilus by typing ssh://myUser@my.server.com\nBut how do I connect to the server2 from there?\n\nA: If your first SSH server (my.server.com) supports TCP Port Forwarding, you can forward a port on your local system (localhost) to my.server2.com via my.server.com:\nssh -fNL 2022:my.server2.com:22 myUser@my.server.com\n\nThis will forward port 2022 on localhost to port 22 on my.server2.com. Then you can connect directly to the second server:\nssh myUser2@localhost:2022\n\nIn Nautilus, you can connect using ssh://myUser2@localhost:2022.\n\nThe -fN flags send SSH to the background, and creates a problem in closing it. There are three ways out:\nAutoclose\nssh -fNL 2022:my.server2.com:22 myUser@my.server.com sleep 10\n\nNow connect using Nautilus before the sleep command finishes executing (10 seconds). The connection will be kept alive as long as Nautilus is connected. When done, disconnect from Nautilus and the connection will be stopped.\nLet the command wait for input\nssh -tL 2022:my.server2.com:22 myUser@my.server.com 'read -p\"Press Enter to exit: \"'\n\nThe read command will wait for input. Press Enter when you're done to close the connection.\nLook up the connection process and kill it\npgrep -fa fNL\n\nThis will show you all processes which have fNL in the command line (there should only be your SSH connection process).\nEither kill the PID of the right process if there are more than one, or use pkill if there is only one process:\n    pkill -f fNL\nThis is pretty much the only option for connections that have already been established using -fN.\nRun no command, and exit as usual\nssh -L 2022:my.server2.com:22 myUser@my.server.com\n\nThis will open a normal shell, from which you can exit as you normally do.\n", "Q: how to setup split-dns for vpn with network-manager I want to create a split-DNS config on a 14.04 desktop machine with both a local eth network and a VPN connection.  Ie I should send DNS lookups for address ranges that are accessed via the vpn to the (private) DNS servers that are configured for that particular vpn connection.  Other addresses which are served via the local net should use different (public) dns servers.  \nhttps://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/  suggests this is easy to do now that we have a local dnsmasq resolver.  Quote:  \n\nThe big advantage is that if you connect to a VPN, instead of having all your DNS traffic be routed through the VPN like in the past, you’ll instead only send DNS queries related to the subnet and domains announced by that VPN. This is especially interesting for high latency VPN links where everything would be slowed down in the past.\n\nBut I can not figure out how to make this work!  With VPN inactive network-manager tells dnsmasq to use the local public DNS servers as its upstream servers (this is good).  If I now activate a VPN connection network-manager tells dnsmasq to change the upstream dns servers to the private ones configured for the vpn connection.   And now all my local traffic goes to vpn for its dns lookups (this is bad!).\nIf I had a \"real\" dnsmasq setup I could tell it in dnsmasq.conf to route specific lookups to specific dns servers.  But how does this work with the cut-down dnsmasq / network-manager setup provided with Ubuntu desktop?    \nI guess that one option is just to install the full dnsmasq,  but this then means that I need to maintain config details in 2 separate places which is the sort of thing that network-manager mostly overcomes.   Any suggestions?\n\nA: To get the D-Bus controlled dnsmasq that NetworkManager runs to use different DNS servers, there are the following options  (obviously adjust domains and IP addresses in the examples):\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a file to /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d that sets the DNS server for the subnet you want: myvpn-server.conf could contain server=/myvpn.domain.com/10.8.4.9. This will always be respected by dnsmasq even when not connected to the VPN, in which case queries for these domains should time out. Disadvantage is that you need to specify the IP address statically, advantage is simplicity\n\n*Use D-Bus to talk directly to dnsmasq to tell it to update the servers using something like sudo dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.dnsmasq /uk/org/thekelleys/dnsmasq uk.org.thekelleys.SetDomainServers \"array:string:192.168.0.1,/myvpn.domain.com/10.8.4.9\". This could be scripted when the vpn connects. You'd need to look up existing DNS servers (the 192.168.0.1 in my example) over D-Bus or using nm-cli\n\n*Use D-Bus to talk to Network Manager itself and tell it to update the servers. Here's an example of doing this using Python which would require some work to include the current servers.\n\n\nI'm using the first option and have only tried preliminary versions of the other two\n\nA: This is most likely a configuration problem on the server side. The vpn server should only push domains that he can resolve. \nFor example if you use an openvpn server a user configuration might look like this: \nifconfig-push 172.16.0.51 255.255.255.0\npush \"route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.0.1\"\npush \"route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.0.6\"\npush \"dhcp-option DNS 172.16.0.1\"\npush \"dhcp-option DOMAIN some.of.your.domains\"\npush \"dhcp-option DOMAIN another.domain\"\n\nThis way your client knows, that your server can only resolve domains specified here.\nThe dnsmasq config can be quite minimal in the case you use Networkmanager: \ndomain-needed\ninterface=lo\nbind-interfaces\n\nOne more common pitfall: You have to configure your vpn connection ip settings in networkmanager to \"use the connection only for resources on its network\" (like here: https://brmlab.cz/_media/project/warzone/nv-routes.png)\nOtherwise the routing will always use your vpn connection over the \"real\" interface. Metrics are normally correctly set by networkmanager (higher metric for vpn than the underlying network)\n\nA: You likely are looking for the DNS Search Domain and Additional DNS Server fields in the IPv4 and IPv6 tabs in the nm-connection-editor application.\nJust enter you companies domain and DNS server IPs there.\n", "Q: Can't get Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to install I am trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my Sony Vaio desktop.

On windows 8.1, it connects with no trouble. I have made sure that I selected the right security mode, and I have entered the router's mac address and ssid manually. I have TL-WDN4800 wireless adapter and a cisco x3500 router. I have tried changing my router's security mode to wpa and also tried disabling security, and my computer still won't connect.\n\nA: I have finally found the solution to my problem. There are only Linux supported drivers for the TL-WDN4800 V1... I figured out I actually have the TL-WDN4800 V3 and the v1 drivers are not supported with the V3 for whatever reason. The windows drivers for this card can be found from the official TP-Link website and can be installed on to linux with Ndiswrapper. \n\nA: *\n\n*Reset your router to its default factory settings. This will ensure nothing esoteric is set in the configuration. See your manual, but best is the 30/30/30 reset. While powered on, hold the reset button down for 30 seconds - don't release it. Pull the plug while holding the reset button and leave power off for 30 seconds - don't release the reset button. Reconnect power while holding the reset button for 30 seconds. Release the reset button. Power off, then on.\n\n*The default config on the router should be IP 192.168.1.1 and it should be handing out addresses via DHCP. Your computer should pick it up as a viable network and connect. As should your smart phone. Nice to use the phone to confirm that the network is actually up.\nIf your phone doesn't connect and your computer doesn't connect, there is likely something amiss with the router itself. Or, you don't have any networking services running on it. Since you say your computer sees the router, neither of these seem likely.\nWhen your equipment connects, it should do so with addresses like 192.168.1.xxx.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window and type ifconfig. The results should show that your network card has an IP address. Also try ping 192.168.1.1 and you should get responses from the router.\n\n", "Q: Unity not working on 14.04 after compiz configurator change I am new to Ubuntu and probably have a noob problem, but it seems to me to be rather complicated, any help will be appreciated.\nI've tried to add opacity property to windows via compiz configurator and suddenly unity has crashed.

I want format it to NTFS and I'm given the option to \"Don't overwrite existing data(quick)\" will this mean it just sets it as NTFS and leaves the operating system and my files (well, whatever is left) and means I can boot into Windows again? \n\nA: No. Quick means it will remove the file allocation table but not actually remove the data from disk. But this will still show you an empty disk. You need a partiton recovery tool to fix this. And that is not possible with the normal Ubuntu DVD. \n\n\n*\n\n*I would also suggest to use Windows tools to fix Windows problems. Using Ubuntu for this can have mixed results.\n\n*I would also suggest to stop what you are doing and use a tool to restoring your disk. \"testdisk\" is such a tool but this will only work if you do NOTHING to the disk after you messed it up.

Since it backups the home dir, often it does it when I have files in used, for example file containers that are mounted as HDDs. I find it hard to believe it can copy them correctly but it just does and doesn't report any errors?\n\nA: A file lock is only of interest when making changes to a file (ie. write, delete, move, rename; things like that).\nDeja dup needs to read a file. (simplified:) It copies the contents of a file that it needs to backup over to a compressed container. So there is no need for the system to complain about the file being locked. \n\n1 extra comment: if a file is in use the one stored on disk will be backupped. Changes made to the file after the backup finished will not be stored to that backup. \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu with Windows XP I would like to install Ubuntu on an old laptop and run in dual boot mode with Windows XP.\nI cannot even get started.

I've got Ubuntu 14.04 installed on my laptop; however, due to the excess bloat I've filled my machine with and the resulting slow speed, I am thinking of doing a clean install of Bodhi Linux.\n# parted /dev/sda print\n\nModel: ATA ST500LT012-1DG14 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 500GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B\nPartition Table: msdos\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type      File system     Flags\n 1      1049kB  10.2GB  10.2GB  primary   ext4            boot\n 2      10.2GB  500GB   490GB   extended\n 5      10.2GB  20.5GB  10.2GB  logical   linux-swap(v1)\n 6      20.5GB  400GB   380GB   logical   ext4\n 7      400GB   500GB   100GB   logical   ext4\n\n\nsda1 is mounted on /boot;\nsda5 is swap;\nsda6 is /home;\nsda7 is /\n\nTo achieve that, I'm going to reformat and then mount sda1 (/boot) and sda7 (/) while mounting sda6 (/home) and sda5 (swap) directly. What I am concerned with is that configuration files (like of xsession and such) present in my /home/USERNAME might interfere with the fresh install. \nTo prevent this, should I delete all the hidden files and folders (none of them are personal) and then go with fresh install? Can this approach lead to problems? Is there any alternate way to achieve the same purpose?\nNote: Backing up personal files and then pasting them is not an option, I don't have that big external storage available. \n\nA: I agree with @muru's comment above.\nMove all the hidden files and folders in /home/USERNAME into a new folder called /home/USERNAME/My Old Congiuration Files and Folders. \nThe fresh install should create new hidden files and folders first time you login and as and when needed.\nOnce you determine that the fresh install is running fine and you don't need any of the old configurations, you can delete the folder.\nHope this helps\n\nA: What I ended up doing is mounting the partition (previously mounted as /home) as /data in the new install without reformatting, this meant I got to retain the config files (some of which were customised, like .emacs) just in case. Once the new OS had installed, I made symlinks of the  main files and directories from new /data to new /home.

Is it really recommended to keep the default desktop environment ?\nI googled a little bit for the answer and found this. \nSo my question is, is it (in any way) a harm to the computer, if I install xfce desktop alongside unity ?\n\nA: You can expect to install anything from the repositories without a serious problem. With multiple DE you sometimes have what are considered cosmetic issues, all of which you can configure. \nOf course, some people find these \"cosmetic\" issues more or less annoying, but, they will not prevent the applications or system from working.\nEach DE tends to have a set of applications for editing, multi media, etc so you will end up with duplicate applications.\nAll of the basic applications will work on any DE or WM. The only real conflict is that you can run only one WM at a time (so you can not run kwin at the same time as unity).\nIn the event you have a problem, ask a more specific question.\n\nA: Well, I'm kinda new to Ubuntu, I've been using it for 2 months now and I already tried out other DEs.

It's not a total solution but it would help you carry on.\nWhen you get into the display settings, if the settings indicate that you are already at the native resolution of your laptop, you should check on the Scale for menu and title bars setting and be sure it's set to 1.

Is there a way to translate such instructions into XFCEese?  I've also seen instructions to configure a Compose key, but my keyboard doesn't have a key with that text.  I'm guessing that there's a way to map this to some actual physical key, but I haven't yet stumbled across instructions that work.\nAlso, some other systems (e.g. my Macbook Pro ;-) have a little on-screen keyboard that shows what chars I'll get if I press a key, and for control keys like shift, alt, etc, rewrites the little window to show what they do to the char codes.  I'm guessing that Xubuntu has something like this hidden somewhere, but I can't guess what it's called, and haven't found it by poking around in things labelled \"keyboard\".  Does it exist somewhere?  Such tools are really handy for learning how to type the input you want on a system you're not familiar with.\n(And why, when I enter \"umlaut diaresis\" in this site's search widget, does it tell me there's no match?

I have written a bash script that calls several other programs and executes a bunch of commands. I run this script from the terminal. Now I want to kill the script.\nPressing Ctrl + C sometimes doesn't cut it, I think because sometimes the script is executing another program, and for some reason the kill signal doesn't work.\nHowever, if I close the terminal window, it kills the script.\nIs there something I can do (a keyboard combination), that is analogous to closing the terminal window, without actually closing the terminal window (I don't want to lose command history, current directory, output history, etc.)?\n\nA: If you know the processes that are associated with the script you can find their PID using \n ps -A\n\nand then use the PID number to kill the corresponding processes using\n kill -9 PID_Number\n\n\nA: You have few options. One is to stop the script (CtrlZ), get the PID of the script and send SIGKILL to the process group.\nWhen a command is executed in a shell, the process it starts and all its children are part of the same process group (in this case, the foreground process group). To send a signal to all processes in this group, you send it to the process leader. For the kill command, process leader is denoted thus:\nkill -PID\n\nWhere PID is the process ID of the script. \nExample:\nConsider a script test.sh which launches some processes. Say you ran it in a shell:\n$ ./test.sh\n\nIn another terminal,\n$ pgrep test.sh\n17802\n$ pstree -ps `!!`\npstree -ps `pgrep test.sh`\ninit(1)───sshd(1211)───sshd(17312)───sshd(17372)───zsh(17788)───test.sh(17802)─┬─dd(17804)\n                                                                               ├─sleep(17805)\n                                                                               └─yes(17803)\n\nIn this case, to send a signal to process group created by test.sh, you'd do:\nkill -INT -17802\n\n-INT is used to send SIGINT, and so this command is the equivalent of pressing CtrlC on the terminal. To send SIGKILL:\nkill -KILL -17802\n\nYou only need to stop the script if you can't open another terminal. If you can, use pgrep to find the PID.\nOne of the commands that the script launches may be trapping SIGINT, which is probably why CtrlC is ineffective. However, SIGKILL can't be trapped, and it is usually a last-resort option. You might want to try SIGTERM (-TERM) before going for the kill. Neither SIGKILL or SIGTERM can be set up as a keyboard shortcut the way SIGINT is.\nAll this is moot if your script doesn't contain a shebang line. From this SO answer:\n\nUsually the parent shell guesses that the script is written for the the same shell (minimal Bourne-like shells run the script with /bin/sh, bash runs it as a bash subprocess) ...\n\nBecause of this, when the script is executed, you won't find a process named after script (or a process with the script's name in the command line) and pgrep will fail.\nAlways use a shebang line.\n\nA: As Harris said you could run Kill -9 PID_Number but you could also install the package known as htop to have an interactive process browser that makes finding specific processes a lot easier. htop also supports killing processes.  \n", "Q: How to arrange this file properly?

While reading about Linux I got the following:\n\ntouch provides several options, but here is one of interest:\nThe -t option allows you to set the date and time stamp of the file.\n  To set the time stamp to a specific time:\n$ touch -t 03201600 myfile\n\nThis sets the file, myfile's, time stamp to 4 p.m., March 20th (03 20 1600).\n\nHere, I am not getting the logic behind 03201600 --> 4pm, March 20th.\n\nA: According to man touch:\n   -t STAMP\n          use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time\n\nSo, your timestamp can be translated to DD/MM hh:mm: 20/03 16:00.\n\nA: Welcome to Linux! You probably read that touch text you quoted in your question from a guide or a book. \nIn Linux, almost every command has a \"manual\" that explains its options. You can view the manual page of any command by executing man <command> on a Linux machine. \nSo, from the command man touch:\n   -t STAMP\n          use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time\n\nSo, your example:\n\n-t 03201600\n\n#Breaking it down:\n\n-t    03     20     16      00\n-t    MM     DD     hh      mm\n-t   month   day   hours  minutes\n\nSo March 20th, 4pm (24-hour format).\nIf you don't have access to a Linux machine, you can view these man pages online from here: http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi. The man page for the command touch is found here: http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?touch\n\nA: The output you posted explains the format by breaking apart the numbers as (03 20 1600):\n03 - March\n20 - 20th\n1600 - 4:00 PM (24-hour clock, where 0000 is midnight)\n\n\nA: \nA timestamp is the current time of an event that is recorded by a\n  computer.\nTimestamps are employed extensively within computers and over networks\n  for various types of synchronization. For example, they are assigned\n  to packets in some network protocols in order to facilitate the\n  reassembly of the data (e.g., human speech) in the proper sequence by\n  the receiving host (i.e., computer). Also, they are used by database\n  management systems (DBMS) to determine the transaction order in the\n  event of a system failure (e.g., a computer crash caused by a loss of\n  electrical power or disk failure).\nTimestamps are also routinely used to provide information about files,\n  including when they were created and last accessed or modified. This\n  information is included in the inode, which is a data structure on a\n  file system on a Unix-like operating system that stores all the\n  information about a file except its name and its actual data.\nAnother important application is events that are recorded in system\n  log files. The timestamps in such files can be extremely useful for\n  monitoring system security and for forensic purposes.\nThe time as recorded by timestamps can be measured in terms of the\n  time of day or relative to some starting point. And it is measured\n  with high precision in small fractions of a second.\nThe accuracy of the time is maintained through a variety of\n  mechanisms, including the high-precision clocks built into computers\n  and the network time protocol (NTP). NTP uses coordinated universal\n  time (UTC) to synchronize computer clock times to a millisecond (and\n  sometimes to a fraction of a millisecond) and uses UDP (user datagram\n  protocol), one of the core Internet protocols, as its transport\n  mechanism.Timestamp\n\nClick here to convert\n", "Q: Extract a Folder from Duplicity Archive Using the duplicity command, I need to specify the following:\n\n*\n\n*a specific folder to restore\n\n*indicate time and date from which to restore\n\n*indicate the destination to restore to\n\nHow can I specify these 3 things using the duplicity command?\n\nA: That's correct, even if it tells \"--file-to-restore\", you can enter any file or folder path (without the \"/\" sign at the beginning of it, for example \"temp/logs\") at \"foldername\" and any \"destination folder\" (with the \"/\"sign at the beginning of it, for example \"/temp/logs\") to the command.\nSample: I want to restore my /temp/logs which is backed-up 3 days ago into the same folder:\nduplicity -t 3D --file-to-restore temp/logs file:///backup/location /temp/logs\n\nSample2: I want to restore my file /temp/logs/app-error.log which is backed-up 3 days ago into the same folder:\nduplicity -t 3D --file-to-restore temp/logs/app-error.log file:///backup/location /temp/logs/app-error.log\n\nNote that you have to give a full destination path for the file.\nSample3: My backup stays at an ftp server=my.ftp.server with user=root at the location=my_backup, the same scenario with #1:\nduplicity -t 3D --file-to-restore temp/logs sftp://root@my.ftp.server/my_backup /temp/logs\n\n\nA: duplicity -t 3D --file-to-restore <foldername> file:///backup/location <destination folder>\n\nDuplicity enters restore mode because the URL comes before the local directory.\n-t 3D 3 days ago\nIf you want to check more information, here are useful links depending on the version:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://duplicity.nongnu.org/vers7/duplicity.1.html\n\n*http://duplicity.nongnu.org/docs.html\n\n*https://duplicity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n", "Q: testphp.php 404 Not Found I installed LAMP Server.

The file reads: <?php phpinfo(); ?>. This information was taken from the guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP. What am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Most likely your file is not in the correct directory. Apache serves files from a directory referred to as the \"Document Root\". Your files must be in this directory for Apache to find them. \nTo check what the Apache is using as the Document Root:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*run less /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default (may need sudo)\n\n*Look for the line the looks like DocumentRoot /some/path. Its towards the top\n\n*Make sure your php scripts are in /some/path\nThis is assuming you haven't made any configuration changes to Apache. This can be much more complex if you have multiple virtual hosts, and aliases, and so forth. But for the default Apache configuration this will do the trick.\n\nA: As like dan08 said, Apache serves files from the directory termed \"Document Root\". The default \"Document Root\" is /var/www/html.\nSo, you have two options now.\n\n\n*\n\n*Either, Put your file into /var/www/html.\n\n*Or, Change \"Document Root\" with the help of dan08's answer. For your case, the DocumentRoot value should be /var/www.\n\n", "Q: Apple wireless keyboard does not work I can't write anythying with my Apple wireless keyboard.I am using ubuntu 14.04 and my computer recognizes only keys u,i,o,j,k,l and three others but it writes numbers.\n\nA: Numlock on Apple Wireless Keyboard\nIf the Apple Wirelesss Keyboard stops working after log-in where most keys do not work and some keys on the right side produce numbers, it is because numlock is enabled by default. Numlock can be switched off by pressing fn-F6 twice. The keyboard then works normally again.\nTo disable numlock by default, go to System -> Preferences -> Keyboard -> Layout -> Layout Options -> Miscellaneous compatibility options -> turn on \"Default numeric keypad keys\"\nThis setting takes effect after logging in and does not affect the graphical login screen or local consoles.\n\nA: I had the same issue, pressing fn-F6 twice was not working at all.

Is it just impossible because of the way Spotify is written? xdotool will actually return the window's ID properly even when it's closed.\nI've tried the \"windowmap\" function and \"windowmove 0 0\", but neither effects any change, really.\nEDIT:\nUser muru suggests re-executing Spotify, in my case, which actually ends up mostly working, although it previously did not. It depends on how Spotify handles being re-opened. I'd love to hear of a generic solution if one exists.\n\nA: In a remote-control script for example, I managed to 'raise' Clementine from tray via D-Bus:\nqdbus org.mpris.clementine /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 Raise\n\nThis should work similarly with Spotify, as it supports the D-Bus protocol.\nThe corresponding command would be:\ndbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.spotify /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Raise\n\n", "Q: Organising Audiobook Folders with Banshee So Banshee has me really confused.  I have 2 folders - Music and Audiobooks which are empty.  I move some m4b audiobooks into the Audiobooks folder and I have unchecked that it should move them to the Library. (If its checked, it moves them into the Music folder instead of the audiobooks one) but I do have checked that it should keep the files and folders organised.  When I do a refresh it loads the audiobooks into the music library AGAIN. Huh?  Even worse, it doesnt reorganised filenames or folders in the Audiobooks folder.  It has no effect. They are all named exactly the same as they were before and there is no folder structure.  All I want is properly organised Music and Audiobook collections.  I've been trying to get it done for the last 3 days with Rhythmbox and Amarok and now Banshee with zero luck.  OMG This shouldn't be that hard! Don't other Ubuntu users have collections of Music and Audiobooks?\n\nA: I just went through this with Banshee 2.6.2 (Ubuntu 14.04): twenty audio books already arranged in their own folders under ~/Audiobooks, and my music in ~/Music. The copy files to media folder option unchecked.\nAfter doing the import into the Music library, select each audiobook in the library browser and then drag it to the Audiobooks source in the left panel.  That moves them from the Music source to Audiobooks (just the library view, not the files).  \nMy audio books were ripped from CD, and each disc was showing its own icon in the Audiobooks library.  These can be merged in the Audiobooks library view by shift or ctrl selecting all of the entries belonging to the same book, then right click and select Merge Discs...  \n", "Q: Cannot write network share I'm trying to set up my personal computer to access my work file shares.

I tell the CP what OS I want installed and it returns an installed system based on their configuration. I do have some options, one of which is use distribution kernel. I can also choose a partition scheme via the web but it only exposes the first drive. I can choose to install all on one disk which would put /, /swap and /home all on that first disk. \n\n*RAID info after their OS install: http://pastebin.com/hGnK9Znp (Asking in the official #ubuntu channel I am told that: \"that's 1 disk with 5 mirrors and zero spares. It has 5 allocated mirrors - it's a very bad config\".) Edit: Is it possible they have just screwed up when setting up the raid? Could it just be down to human error on their part?\nDesired Outcome:\n\n\n*\n\n*Raid1 system and swap disk  Do I have to allocate a whole disk to this or can I use part of one? Sys and swap will never need 4TB will they? As I understand it, and if a whole disk is used, this would be 4Tb storage and 1 drive redundancy (eg a mirror of that drive).\n\n*Raid5 for the remaining 4 drives as one big volume on which /home lives.  As I understand it, with raid5 this would provide 12TB of storage and single drive redundancy.\nObstacles \n\n\n*\n\n*I am not a linux geek\n\n*I am unable to alter the way the OS is installed. I do have a 'recovery mode' which loads an image via the net and allows me to work with the various systems on the installed OS. I can, for example, run parted but apt-get doesn't work.\n\n*I have no idea how to get from the RAID array listed above to the config I have described.\n\n*I am stuck with this server and this provider.\nComplete loss of data is fine if I end up where I need to be.\nI have looked at some official documentation but it seems out of date or is otherwise inapplicable. Specifically these resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID\n\n*help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto\n\n*www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/\n\n\nEdit 2: The advice I got from #Ubuntu is: \"basically, break the 5 mirrors, create new raid 5/6 array out of them, that is it (if you don't want to touch the root disk). Once thats done, remove the remaining 1 disk raid 1 out of raid configuration as there are no more mirrors for it, you need to remove it. I advise you to mark the 5 mirrors as \"failed\" before removing them so it thinks the disks have failed before you disable them.\nWhile that makes sense conceptually, the practical application of that advice is beyond my current understanding.\nI've tried to be comprehensive in describing my problem, but I am sure I have left salient details out. Please ask for clarification where needed. \nThanks :D\n\nUpdate 2014.09.05\nI have re installed the OS using the Custom Installation option and the Install Entirely On First Disk option in the partition scheme dialogue.  This leaves the remaining drives completely untouched. This means I should be able to set them up as a new raid array instead of having to undo the default raid array as installed.\n\nA: The short answer: \nUsing ovh's CP choose reinstall and tick custom install.\nSelect Install all on first disk.\nInstall.\nLog in as root and the other drives are completely unallocated. You can act on them as you would any other drives and there is no pre-installed raid to overcome.\nAlso, I decided to go with backups over raid 5 or 6 after reading about the odds of a volume failure after a drive failure.

The Fn key is working nondeterministically, causing unintended consequences for my computer.  As an example, as we all know, F5 is the browser refresh key.  However, F5 is also the key that causes the display to change between the main display and an external monitor.  Sometimes when I press F5 with a browser open, the page will refresh and when I press Fn+F5 the display will change, and sometimes the opposite happens, seemingly at random (although it changes only when the computer reboots; the behaviour is constant as long as the computer is not rebooted).\nTo answer the obvious question: The Fn key is not sticky as best as I can tell.\n\nA: It's really hard to tell if a key is sticking but they often do. \nWith a standard PC keyboard (inexpensive), I've often turned them upside down and rapped on the bottom and been amazed at the crud that fell out.\nWith a laptop keyboard that is more expensive and harder to replace sometimes I'll just tap the key repeatedly until it works as advertised. \nBlowing the keys out with canned air often works and if your not big on replacing things is likely the best idea.\nI've never seen a software problem that was intermittent that didn't have an underlying hardware problem (bad sector in swap, stuck bit in RAM, short in cable, crud in keyboard, cold solder joint...)\n", "Q: New (computer-illiterate)Ubuntu user needs information I am in need of an operating system for my new laptop which was donated to me. I have NO idea how to download/work this computer. It will be used by my children for their school work mostly. \nI don't have the internet at home except for on my cell phone, and I am still fuddling around with that on how to use it. In the directions online, it states to download Ubuntu onto a stick drive. Does this mean that I can download it on my cell phone and transfer it to the SD card and then use the SD card on the laptop to download the Ubuntu operating system?\nAlso, I do not have any internet at home, as I cannot afford it at this time. Is an operating system the same thing as the internet? Or do I have to find a free or discounted rate internet, for the laptop to work?\nThank you & God bless,\n\nA: It is not possible to use just a cell phone to create an SD card that will install Ubuntu\nFirst, Not all laptops have SD card readers and even if yours have one, there is no guarantee that your laptop can boot from the SD card.\nSecond, downloading the file into an SD card using your phone is not enough. The card needs to be prepared using the downloaded file and other software so that your laptop can boot from the SD card. This is not possible using only a cell phone.\nInternet and the operating system are not the same thing\nThink of your laptop as a car. The operating system is the engine. The internet is all the paved roads in your country and beyond. You don't need the internet to enjoy your car. You can install an air-conditioner in the car. That would be a program in your laptop. Then you can turn the engine on and enjoy the cool air without going anywhere. Your children can turn on the lights, and honk the horn. You can drive it around in your yard, if you have a big yard. But if you have no engine in the car, the air-conditioner, lights, horn will not work. These are different programs in your laptop.\nWhat to do?\nIf you really need to install Ubuntu in your laptop, you will need a working computer that is connected to the internet. This can be at your friend's home, at an internet cafe, or at a public library (depending on the country you live in). Then you will have to follow the instructions about how to prepare a Live-USB stick using the working computer. When that is ready you will have to follow the instructions about how to boot your laptop using the USB stick you have prepared. This is like changing or putting a new engine in a car. I suggest you read a lot before you try.\nAlternately, go to a book store and find a book on Ubuntu. If possible leaf through the book to make sure that if has instructions for how to install Ubuntu. Some of the books include a DVD with Ubuntu in it. If you find one, you can use the DVD to install Ubuntu without the Internet. \nBest of luck.\n", "Q: Return only line number, if pattern 'Exist' and 'Not Exist'. using 'grep' command I have this sample file for my input:\nxyxxyx xyxx xxyx yxyy yxyx\nxxyxxx xx xyx xxx x y x xxyy\nyxxy xyxxy xxy y x y\nxyxy xyx yyxx xyyxyxy xyx\nyxyy xyy yxyx xxyxyyx\n\nAnd I tried to find only \"xyx\" word if exist in line and return line number. for example in this input just line 2 and 4 have \"xyx\", and the result I desired is only would be 2 and 4 (line numbers) but grep command give me all 5 lines. this result:\ngrep -n \"xyx\" test | cut -f1 -d:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nIf I run follow command without cut -f1 -d\" I see that find all \"xyx\" such as in \"xyxxyx\", \"xyxx\", \"xxyx\" and \"yxyx\" for example in first line, while that is wrong, my pattern only and only exist in line 2 and 4 and it is third word in line 2 and second & 5th word in line 4.

I've installed dual-boot setups of Ubuntu before and have never run into any major problems (with the installation) until now.\nIt started when I tried to run the \"Install Ubuntu\" option from the Live USB I created. It didn't recognize the Win 7 OS already installed (I just did a clean install yesterday) so it didn't give me the option to \"Install Alongside\". I did some searching on this site and the Ubuntu Forums and just Google in general, but most of it applied to UEFI systems (which I do not have). \nThe best option seems to be to shrink the main C: drive (/dev/sda5 in the screenshot below), then install Ubuntu on the newly freed up space. My question, though, is can I get rid of the Recovery (sda1), System Reserved (sda2) and Hibernation (sda6) partitions as well? This is a desktop so I don't need hibernation and I have recovery disks that work fine. But will the deletion of these prevent me from using my Win 7 partition?\nScreenshot: GParted Screenshot\n\nScreenshot: fdisk Output\n\nOther questions related to mine:\nis it necessary to delete the recovery partition? (Really? I can't delete it? Other answers seem to disagree)\nDeleting recovery partition on dual boot machine and resizing window 7 partition (I only have OEM supplied recovery disks, without the extra options that the Microsoft-supplied ones have)\nWhat is the best way to set all this up? If I shrink then install will GRUB be able to find my Win 7 installation?\n\nA: Alright, figured it out. I kept the Recovery but I deleted the Hibernation Partition.\nIn Windows, I turned hibernation off with the \"powercfg.exe -h off\" command in the terminal. Then, in Disk Management, I deleted the Hibernation Partition then extended the Acer partition into it. The problem, though, was that it was still an extended partition and when I tried to shrink it it would give me \"Free Space\" within the extended partition instead of the coveted \"Unallocated Space\" outside the extended partition.\nRebooted Windows to make sure everything was still working. \nThen, I booted up my Live USB of Ubuntu and brought up GParted. First, I changed the size of the Acer partition \"sda5\" (within the extended partition \"sda3\") to give me about 500GB of free space. Then, I changed the size of the extended partition \"sda3\" to free up the free space into the unallocated space I needed.\nRebooted Windows to make sure everything was still working (again). \nThen, I used the Live USB to install Ubuntu onto that unallocated space. I chose the \"Something Else\" option, created a 484GB \"/\" partition and a 16GB \"Swap\" (I know, too big, but I wasn't thinking clearly). I installed and then rebooted.\nIt booted right into Ubuntu without giving me the GRUB screen. Followed the directions from \"GRUB does not detect Windows\" and now it works like a charm!\nHope this helps someone else!\n", "Q: Using upstart for non-daemon tasks I would like to have foo do-startup-things run on boot, and foo do-shutdown-things run on shutdown where foo is my own program.\nIt looks like Upstart is a good candidate to do this, but Upstart seems to be designed for use with daemons, so running service foo stop gives the error stop: Unknown instance: because the process executed when the startup job was run is no longer running.\nIs there a way to use Upstart to execute tasks on startup and shutdown without starting a daemon?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible. You should define two task job, here is an example:\nFirst create startTaskJob.conf:\n# startTaskJob - \n#\n# This service print \"script start\" and end \ndescription \"print script start\"\nstart on runlevel [2345]\n\ntask\nconsole log\nscript\n  exec  echo \"script start\"\nend script\n\nYou can test it with:\nsudo start startTaskJob\n\nand the output will be saved in /var/log/upstart/startTaskJob.log\nThan create stopTaskJob.conf:\n# stopTaskJob - \n#\n# This service print \"script stop\" and end \ndescription \"print script stop\"\nstart on runlevel [016]\n\ntask\nconsole log\nscript\n  exec  echo \"script stop\"\nend script\n\nThis script will be executed every time system enter in runlevel 0, 1 or 6. At shutdown runlevel become 0 and upstart init process will run it because of \"start on runlevel [016]\".\nYou can test it:\nsudo start stopTaskJob\n\nUPDATE:\nThis is an example on how to do this in a single file.\n# taskJob - \n#\n# This service print environment variable \n# start on runlevel \ndescription \"print environment variable\"\nstart on runlevel [0123456]\ntask\nconsole log\nscript\nif [ \"$RUNLEVEL\" = \"0\" -o \"$RUNLEVEL\" = \"1\" -o \"$RUNLEVEL\" = \"6\" ]; then\n    exec  echo \"(stopTask) $UPSTART_EVENTS - $RUNLEVEL - job $UPSTART_JOB\" \nelse\n    exec  echo \"(startTask) $UPSTART_EVENTS - $RUNLEVEL - job $UPSTART_JOB\"\nfi\nend script\n\nI tested it on lubuntu 12.04 and this is /var/log/upstart/taskJob.log content after restart:\n(stopTask) runlevel - 6 - job taskJob\n(startTask) runlevel - 2 - job taskJob\n\n", "Q: md5 hashes are different with iso-images of 14.04 amd64 server and desktop What shall I care for?\nAre sums given at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes wrong?\nOr do used progs calculate wrong?\ndescription/Source                                  md5-hash\nWinMD5Sum: ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso          ca2531b8cd79ea5b778ede3a524779b9\nWinMD5Sum: ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso         119cb63b48c9a18f31f417f09655efbd\nUbuntuSite hash: ubuntu-14.04-server-amd64.iso      01545fa976c8367b4f0d59169ac4866c \nUbuntuSite hash: ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso     dccff28314d9ae4ed262cfc6f35e5153 \nfileVerifier++: ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso     ca2531b8cd79ea5b778ede3a524779b9\nfileVerifier++: ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso    119cb63b48c9a18f31f417f09655efbd\n\nAs you may see, WinMD5Sum and fileVerifier++ calculate the same value, but different from values shown at above mentioned site.\n\nA: The MD5 hashes for the Ubuntu 14.04 iso from the Ubuntu Hashes website that you linked in your question were lasted edited on 2014-04-18 22:44:22.

If boot-repair fails it has to be an evil Microsoft, the reptilians or some other conspiracy.\n\n\nA: Well, you can try a few tools if you have spare discs around(not sure if live usb's would work).  I've had issues with this many times, make sure your BIOS is also set to boot from the right place (some more advanced ones will even let you choose the OS.)  Also make sure you're NOT using UEFI if possible.  It causes more issues with live CDs and Linux than I think it adds features.  Linux also works better with Legacy when possible(I found that out the hard way).  Some tools that you can try are \nGparted Magic Live CD: A free Open Source (I think) version of Parted Magic.  Also useful for partition related issues, recovery stuff, diagnostics (hardware and software) and a few other things.  \nHiren's Boot CD: Lot of features in this.  A lot of what the above contains, but more variety.  I'd still recommend getting both for future use if you have the spare discs.  Note:Look hard for the download link, it's there, it just sorta looks like an add for whatever stupid reason they decided to do that...\nUltimate Boot CD: Can't remember what's on here, but it's mainly for recovery and boot issues.  I know it's useful though.  \nThen there's the one most likely to fix your issues out of the ones shown.\nSuper Grub Disk 2 and Rescatux.  The Super Grub Disk is basically a Live CD of Grub on steroids, and Rescatux is extremely helpful for Grub issues, and even some Winderp$ repairs.  Note:I can't seem to find where it says the two are bundled together, or any download links for them bundled together, but the copy I have does have them both.

The open source ones were not allowing Chrome to do proper graphics\n", "Q: problems getting canon mg2920 to work with latest 64bit desktop version of Ubuntu. Did my legwork! I cant seem to get my printer to work.\nI followed the directions here: https://sites.google.com/site/tipsandtricksforubuntu/printer-info/canon-drivers\nMy printer isnt listed, so im forced to choose another (similar) model, or if I use the (recommended) generic text only driver, it doesnt print the entire page. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: According to Canon:\n\n\"There is no driver for the OS Version you selected. The driver may be included in your OS or you may not need a driver.\"\n\nIn other words if Ubuntu doesn't support it, then you have to build your own driver.\nIt's not a bad idea to try to use a driver for a different model, but this usually yields poor results.\n", "Q: Chrome Weird Shortcut I recently ran the ubuntu updater on my computer, and it seems like it messed up my google chrome installation. Every time I open Google chrome, on the menu bar, instead of showing up as the normal chrome icon, it shows a slightly blurrier version, and when I put my mouse over it, it says \"Digital Ocean Control Panel\", which was one of the tabs when the updater ran.\nWhat can I do to get rid of this? I tried uninstalling chrome, I tried purging chrome, and I also tried deleting ~/.config/google-chrome, but still when I reopen chrome, it shows up on the menu bar as Digital ocean, instead of Google Chrome.\n\nA: Found it!\nThis tutorial did the trick! http://kb.openstudioproject.com/content/fix-double-google-chrome-icon-docky-and-plank\nQuote:\nAfter the update to Chrome 35 and again with the update to 36 I discovered the launcher in docky and plank wasn't matching the chrome window correctly anymore. So it would show the launcher with a nice icon and then the actually launched app with a very low quality icon. Luckily, it's a simple fix... so let's get started. Open a terminal and type:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop\n\nYou'll find 3 entries in this file, [Desktop Entry], [NewWindow Shortcut Group] and [NewIncognito Shortcut Group]. Make sure that under each group there's the following line, it doesn't matter where in the group it is.\nStartupWMClass=Google-chrome-stable\n\nFor convenience, here is the modified chrome.desktop file for Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr. Just replace it with the one you have in /usr/share/applications/.\n", "Q: Problem in launchimg TopCoder Arena I have a IcedTea plugin for TopCoder Arena. I used it till a week back.

I have AFP installed via Ubuntu Software Center, however that seems to be not good enough.\nHow can I get it working?\nI have done some research before posting this and I'm being told (from Adobe's website) to download the tar ball, extract, then cp the files into certain directories, namely libflashplayer.so into Chromium's \"browser plug-in directory\" and a /usr folder into \"the flash player local settings configuration.\" \nI presume this process will work given that it's in Adobe's readme file; I have a few questions about the instructions. How do I find the browser plugin in directory, generally speaking; I'd like an answer that applies to any OS as well as browser if possible.\nIf there is a better way to go about solving this problem, please address it.\n\nA: You could just use Chrome instead of Chromium, if you need a browser to work with flash out of the box. (I am not sure about Chromium, but am using Chrome and I have Flash built in which works fine.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch: kill Windows Manager and start xterm in GUI Mode I installed xterm  and I would want it to be the Only GUI application running.\nso I killed the lighdm using: \nsudo service lighdm stop.\n\nand try to run xterm using: \nsudo xterm \n\nthrough a SSH terminal, but I can't run xterm because it says DISPLAY not set up error.\nWhere is xinit/startx in Ubuntu touch 14.10?\n\nA: you have to tell your terminal that you want xterm to start on the display you are currently sitting in front of.

I've looked into everything I can find, looked into pulseaudio along with alsa, and even OSS (But I can't find much on it, however I think that it might be the better way to go).  I really don't know where to go here, but I really want virtual 7.1 audio like I had on Winderp$.  \nLogitech has their own gaming software on Winderp$ that does this excellently, but for obvious reasons this isn't helping my issue.  I doubt wine would help, but if it would someone let me know.  I really want a fix to this, and as long as it can be done, I'll do whatever it takes.  Thank you for your time and answers.  \nAlso, I do not believe this is a standard sterio device, as it's still ONLY using my front speakers on Linux, and whenever I do not have the Logitech Software installed on Winderp$.  If it's only using my front two speakers (or at least front channels), then my device must have been made in a way to where it's borderline actually 7.1 and not entirely virtual.  Also, running \n\nspeaker-test -c 8\n\nUses all channels properly in the proper positions except for LFE.  I had to do a little configuring to get it to do this, but everything still thinks this is just a sterio device.  I think this is proof enough that my request is possible.  \nEven if it was just virtual, I still want a way to fix it and get 7.1 back.  \nThis is the result of lsusb -v:\n\nBus 003 Device 002: ID

It may also contain commands which are used indirectly by scripts.  /usr/bin/ is the primary directory of executable commands on the system.  Source: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5915/difference-between-bin-and-usr-bin\n\n*The executable needs to have the execute permission set properly and it needs to be located within a directory listed in the $PATH environment variable for the shell in which you are trying to execute it.  For example, if your PATH contains /usr/local/bin , any executable in that folder can be run by simply typing the name of the command at the prompt.\n\n*This is quite variable depending on the application, but one can count on at least some information under /etc for system-wide programs that have settings files, files within your home folder for user-specific settings, man files under /usr/local/share somewhere.

Please help me. :(\n\nA: Generally it's easiest for dual booting to install Windows first - this is because once you install Windows it'll over write the GRUB bootloader and not give you the option to boot into Linux. \nIt's just a recommendation though - you can easily repair GRUB using Rescatux boot disk, or just boot of Ubuntu Live USB and install\\run boot-repair package.\nNow for the half NTFS, in Ubuntu firstly install gparted:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nOpen up GParted, resize your partition by shrinking the available space to how big you want the NTFS partition to be.\nYou will be left with your Ext4 Ubuntu partition, and then a grey 'unallocated space'\nClick on that unallocated space and make a new partition with it, select all the space free and select the option to format as NTFS.\nWhen you go to install Windows, you can click the NTFS partition and choose to install there.\nWindowsDualBoot\nHow to Partition Your Hard Drive for Ubuntu and Windows\nEdit: As mentioned once you successfully install Windows you will lose access to Ubuntu on the other patition when booting, and as mentioned do a search for Rescatux or Boot-Repair for Ubuntu to restore GRUB\n\nA: I think its easy, just install Windows (Ver.) once the installation (.of windows) asks you what do you want to do (upgade or fresh install) do a fresh install (.format) and format the entire hdd (.hard drive) without creating a 3rd partition (1st.Windows Reserved~100MB,2nd Your Windows OS and 3rd Ubuntu) you dont have to.\nOnce the installation finishe's install ubuntu by pressing a key while you see a keyboard on ubuntu launch at the bottom of your screen, select your languange and then select install ubuntu after that it will ask you at some point how ubuntu will install (along side with windows) yeah you have to select it and then do a normal installation.\nThank you for reading this i hope i helped\n~sorry for my bad english i'm from greece~ ^_^\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu alongside windows, OS not detecting?

I have tried all your support of legacy mode and secure boot on off option but it did not work, i need Ubuntu plzz help, what to do??\n\nA: You should install Ubuntu in another hard drive partition not in the same where Windows is installed which is usually C drive. Do one thing. Format some other partition of may be D or E (if you have these). Format them completely. And when you install Ubuntu select that formatted drive. It should install smoothly and should be able to detect. If you still face problems then edit your question telling what exactly you have done in installing process.

Usually you need to shrink your windows partition before installing to provide enough free space for the new install. You might need to defragment your hard drive before doing so because linux will need a contiguous block of memory. If all of your files are scattered over the partition it might be impossible to shrink the windows partition enough for the install.\nEdit:\nIf you have already moved all data from that partition, then delete the partition to create unallocated space. This will be where ubuntu is installed. Ubuntu can't automatically guess that your NTFS partition is where you want it to install, all Ubuntu can use is the unallocated space on the drive.\n\nA: At the moment, the simplest thing that can be done is delete the D: partition (not format it). Either using GParted or the Windows Disk Management tool. This will create unused space, which the installer can go ahead and use.\n", "Q: Disable unnecessary startup services and applications What is the best practices to disable unnecessary startup services and applications? This post is very useful when i came to decide what to disable Which startup applications can I safely disable? , but i cannot find how to start! also i cannot find anything related to services.\n\nA: Go to the dock and search for Startup Applications. The GUI is very simple and you can remove programs from the list to stop them from automatically starting. Only remove programs that you know are not essential.\n\nA: According to UpstartCookBook:\n\nWith Upstart 0.6.7, to stop Upstart automatically starting a job, \nyou can either:\n\n    - Rename the job configuration file such that it does not end with \n      \".conf\".\n    - Edit the job configuration file and comment out the \"start on\" stanza \n      using a leading '#'.\n\nTo re-enable the job, just undo the change.\n\n\nAnother better approach is:\n\nWith Upstart 1.3, you can make use of an \"override file\" and the manual \nstanza to achieve the same result in a simpler manner:\n\n# echo \"manual\" >> /etc/init/myjob.override\n\nNote that you could achieve the same effect by doing this:\n\n# echo \"manual\" >> /etc/init/myjob.conf\n\nHowever, using the override facility means you can leave the original job \nconfiguration file untouched.\n\nTo revert to the original behaviour, either delete or rename the override \nfile (or remove the manual stanza from your \".conf\" file).\n\n\nmanual stanza tell Upstart to ignore the start on/stop on stanzas.\nIn order to disable SystemV init service:\n\nTo enable/disable a service in a particular runlevel, you only need to\ncreate/remove a symbolic link in a particular directory or set of \ndirectories.\n\n\nThis means that you should remove symbolic link in /etc/rc**runlevel**.d/NN**name**  whose  target is script /etc/init.d/name\nAnother better approach is update-rc.d command that can disable service:\n   update-rc.d name disable\n\nYou can stop service and start service manually until /etc/init.d/name exists.\nTo disable service permanently, remove /etc/init.d/name.\nBe careful what you do, disable service or job can result an unusable system.\nFinally, this is a useful link on how to disable Gnome Session Startup applications and here another on How do I make a program auto-start every time I log in? where you can learn where information are stored and which GUI are available, so I guess you should find out how to disable session application on your system.\n", "Q: (QML) What does the \"?\" do in defining properties?

For example, I normally open mousepad (xfce equivalent of gedit) from the applications menu. However, I know that you can also do this in a terminal by typing mousepad. \nFollowing this example, what I want is whenever I open mousepad via GUI, a new line is written in a log file stating something like Sep 5 15:35:11 lucho@lucho:~$ mousepad. More in general, what I want is to log all GUI activities that are potentially do-able via command-line (like opening programs, changing permissions, modifying a system settings, etc) but written in its alternative command-line execution format. I want this in order to improve my knowledge of how to use the command-line (without going through the man pages). There are many things I do through the GUI which I don't do via command-line (some potentially automatable via a script or via keyboard shortcuts) and having this log file would be a good way to learn them.\nI'm aware of the existence of the syslog file in /var/log but that is not what I need. The Activity Log Manager app from Ubuntu repositories does not show command-line format, so far as I know. I need something like the .bash_history file that exist in my home folder but recording my GUI-based activities. \n\nA: Proposing that kind log file as base for learning is actually a brilliant idea!\nUnfourtunately, many actions of GUI programs are implemented in the program itself, not using external commands; And even if it uses external commands, it may be in a different way than one would do it in a shell;\nSo that does not exist, and is not easy to implement.\nBut I have a solution for a part of the problem: The program name in the GUI is sometimes differen from the program name one needs to know for a shell command - not only if the GUI name is translated to a local language.\nFor example, how to start the program Files in the comman line?\nWe need to look into all *.desktop files for the name.

A VM is all about tweaking it to your liking... too slow? add more RAM to the machine. Not enough space? Increase the machine.\nBut for development itself... unlikely you notice it. \nDrawbacks. Nah. Only thing that annoyed me in the past was the constant switching between system and VM session. For all other purposes it worked very well. \n\nhow can I get versions of these drivers specifically for Ubuntu ?\n\nLinux uses generic drivers to set up your initial system. So IF the hardware is supported the driver will automatically install it for you. For your graphic card it can be useful to install the proprietary driver. This one will also be included in your system but as an option to install after the system is installed. See \"dash\",\"additional drivers\". After a little search it will show all it can find based on your hardware (besides the graphics card it sometimes also list one for your wireless (Broadcom for instance)). \n\nGeneral advice: boot up one of the Ubuntu Live DVDs and have a look for yourself. In general: it it works during the Live session it will work after a normal install.

Is there a fix ?\n\nA: Ok, the issue here is that you tried flashing it without mounting, make sure the path is /mnt/ or /media/, so you are sure you have mounted properly.\nIf I were you I would use a GUI for this sort of thing.\n\nA: One of three things could be happening here (I'm not too familiar with Raspian):\nThe SD card is interfering with the boot sequence\nIt's possible that for some reason the boot process is picking up the partitions/files on the SD card and causing it to fail booting, try simply removing the SD card and reboot. I believe that should do the trick, if not you might have some trouble.\nYou fried your partition\nIf that command that you have above is the actual command you used, there shouldn't have been a problem. However, if you instead typed something along the lines of of=/dev/sdX# or of=/dev/sdX, then that would have friend the beginning of the partition number # or the beginning of the disk respectively.\nIf you did, in fact, somehow manage to fry your partition, then there's really not a lot you can do to recover the data aside from using a tool like testdisk (which may or may not work depending on whether all backup superblocks were wiped) or, worst case, scalpel to recover the files. Otherwise, simply reformat and try again.\ndd can potentially be a very destructive program. It has no warnings that would tell you \"Hey buddy, are you really sure you want to do this? It's probably a bad idea\" -- it just goes. Therefore, you need to be sure that the command you type is the command you really want. For example, you might ensure that /dev/mmcblk is the correct device by first mounting the SD card (or a partition on it) and then finding the device listed in the mount command. However, from the command you typed it should have worked as expected...\nThere is an error in the boot sequence\nI've seen this happen while creating custom ISOs and it tends to happen when the root filesystem can't be found (or it's corrupted). If you have a separate /home partition, then there still may be problem with with the root partition while your /home partition remained untouched.\nAs described here, remove the kernel options quiet and splash and append the kernel option debug while in GRUB (the bootloader). To do this, press E while you have a boot option selected. Once the line is edited, press Ctrl+X to boot.\nThis will write a /tmp/initramfs.debug file. After the system fails to boot, you can then use the httpd command to allow another computer to access the filesystem via a browser, or you can simply reboot with a LiveCD and examine the file. What you may be looking for is a line that says something similar to \"Unable to find root partition.\"\nIt is also possible that the root filesystem is corrupt and needs to be fixed with a filesystem check. In order to do this, first boot from a LiveCD/USB.\n\n*\n\n*Open a console\n\n*Find the partition in question using gparted-pkexec.

The name defined into the DNS may be different from the one defined into the server.\nAlso, on the machine from which you are accessing your server, there may be some /etc/hosts file with another name used to map to the IP address of your server.\nSo, your server with IP a.b.c.d can be called vps internally (/etc/hostname & /etc/hosts).\nOn the Internet, there may be offical DNS name XXXXXX.com pointing to a.b.c.d.\nOn local desktop, you can even have a local /etc/hosts file where you have the name ZZZZZZ.com defined for a.b.c.d.\n\nA: \nIn /ect/hosts it says site host is xxxxxx.com but you can access it by a different name zzzzzzz.com .

To my surprise, there was no 'tuntap' pattern in that manual page. However 'ip tuntap' is well-supported when I try to use that command.\nSo I guess that my local manual page for 'ip' is outdate and need to be upgraded. I know that some manual pages can be installed by 'apt-get install XXX-doc'. But how can I upgrade the manual for 'ip'?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: Right, the ip subcommand tuntap is described in man ip under 14.04 Trusty, but not under 12.04 Precise.\nIf the command itself in the latest repository version for Precise does indeed support ip tuntap, the missing description is a bug that should be reported for the package iproute2.\nThe man page is in the main package, iproute2. The package iproute2-doc does exist, but is an empty transitional package, with dependency on iproute2.\nI do not know how to best get a package installed with an updated man page - it may not be easy, because the software is in the same package.\nBut you can get the man page versions of the Ubuntu releases online at http://manpages.ubuntu.com - for example man ip for Precise and man ip for Trusty.\n", "Q: How to locally add my charms to the juju-gui?

Sorry in advance, but I have tried what I take to be the 'normal' way already (see below), so here it goes:\nI have an Intel Atom D525 1.8GHz with a discrete NVIDIA ION 512MB DDR3 graphics card, on which I run (for reasons I will spare you) Ubuntu 11.10. What I want to know is primarily how to fix the laggy behaviour on my current setup. The machine is supposed to be able to support HD video. In fact, the spec sheet says:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Digital HDMI v1.3 output (DVI via adapter), max. 1920 x 1200\n  \n*Analog VGA output, max. 2048 x 1536 \n  \n*NVIDIA PureVideo HD supports full HD decode (1080i/p)\n  \n\nI have the machine connected to the TV via HDMI.

What was the first Ubuntu release which features the bootable live CD option which makes it possible to run the OS without installing it?\n\nA: It started with Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)\nThe live CD allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at all.\n\nThe desktop CD allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer\n  at all, and at your option to install it permanently later. This type\n  of CD is what most people will want to use. You will need at least\n  256MB of RAM to install from this CD.Ubuntu 4.10\n\n6.06 was the first Ubuntu release whose live CD image would install the OS. \nThanks to Eliah Kagan for the corrected info\n\nA: Every Ubuntu release has had a live CD feature. Live images were always functional, but over time they have risen in prominence and usefulness, especially over the course of the first several releases.\n4.10\nThe first release ever of Ubuntu was 4.10 Warty Warthog. As detailed in the release announcement and download archive, installation and live CD images existed separately. The live CD did not support installing the system, and the install CDs were not live.\nThere was also no 64-bit live CD. (Though the 32-bit live CD, as in later versions, worked on both 32-bit and 64-bit PCs.)\n\nLive CD\nThe live CD allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at\n  all. There is one image available:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Intel x86 live CD\nFor almost all PCs. This includes most machines with Intel/AMD/etc\n  type processors and almost all computers that run Microsoft Windows.\n  ....\n\nFrom the 4.10 download page.\n\nUbuntu 4.10 Warty Warthog live CD boot loader, boot splash, GNOME loading screen, and GNOME desktop\n5.04\n5.04 Hoary Hedgehog came next. It had live CDs for 32-bit and 64-bit PCs and for PPC Macs (the three architectures Ubuntu supported at that time). According to its release notes, it was the first GNU/Linux distro \"to offer Live CDs for all three architectures simultaneously.\"\nLike 4.10, the installation CD images for 5.04 were not live.\nHowever, as can be seen on the 5.04 download page, there was also a 5.04 DVD. Like the CD and DVD images that came later, the 5.04 DVD images were live and offered the ability to install Ubuntu. And like the live CD and install CD images, the live/install DVD images were provided for all three supported architectures.\nBack then, the DVD images contained two separate modes. Installing from a DVD was not graphical, and the system could not be installed from within the live environment (without rebooting the DVD). Thus even these images did not correspond to the \"desktop CD\" images we use today.\nThe 4.10 DVD images are not archived on http://old-releases.ubuntu.com, but their .list and .manifest files are there, documenting their existence. For example:\nubuntu-5.04-dvd-amd64.list           07-Apr-2005 16:40  188K  Install/live DVD for AMD64 computers (file listing)\nFrom the file listing on the 5.04 download page.\n(See also 5.04's MD5SUMS file, which includes hashes for the DVD images.)\n5.10\n5.10 Breezy Badger came next. (Announcement, release notes.) Like 5.04, 5.10 had separate live CD and install CD images, as well as DVD images that would do both (and images of all three types existed for all three supported architectures).\n5.10's DVD images exist today, alongside the other image types, in the archive.\nI mention 5.10 mainly because it was the first release to have separate server installation images. Like the install images, these were not live. They are significant to this topic because the server ISOs would eventually became the only full-size non-live installation ISO images.\n6.06 LTS\nUbuntu 6.06 LTS Dapper Drake (announcement, release notes) was a major step forward in the way Ubuntu ISO images were made.\nPrevious releases had separate live CD ISOs (which would not install) and install CD ISOs (which were not live). Instead, 6.06 offered:\n\n\n*\n\n*a desktop CD, which was both live and usable to install the OS (and was the generally recommended way to install the OS), and\n\n*an alternate CD, which was not live and resembled the \"install CD\" images of previous releases.\n\n\n(6.06 also continued to offer a bigger live/install DVD image, as in 5.04 and 5.10. All three image types plus the server images, for all architectures, can be accessed today on the archived download page.)\nThe desktop CDs used the new Ubiquity graphical installer (6.06 was the first release to use it). This allowed Ubuntu to be installed from the same environment in which it was being used live.\nIn contrast, even the DVD images (of 6.06, and in previous releases 5.04 and 5.10) provided live and installation functionality separately. For live mode, you'd type the live boot option on start.\nBy then, Ubuntu supported some additional architectures besides 32- and 64-bit PCs and PPC Macs: HP PA-RISC and IA-64. There were no live CDs on these architectures (so the alternate CD, or the server CD, had to be used).\nUbuntu 6.06 LTS established the way we usually install Ubuntu today — with a desktop CD that combines and integrates a live environment and an installer.\n\nUbuntu 6.04.1 LTS Dapper Drake live CD boot loader, boot splash, and GNOME desktop with About Ubuntu and Ubiquity\n\nUbuntu 6.04.1 LTS Dapper Drake live CD – zoomed view showing live desktop with the Ubiquity installer running\n12.10\nEvery release from Ubuntu 6.06 LTS to 12.04 LTS (announcement, release notes) had desktop, alternate, and server CD images — and a separate, bigger DVD image.\nStarting in Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal (announcement, release notes), the alternate CD image was discontinued. This was also the first release whose desktop images would not (ordinarily) fit on a CD, and had to be burned to a DVD or written to a USB flash drive. Separate DVD images were discontinued as of 12.10, too.\n\nThe Ubuntu desktop images have been consolidated to a single  improved\n  image with a size of 800MB.  This desktop image folds in  the advanced\n  partitioning options from the alternate installer  (removing the need\n  for alternate and DVD images) and introduces  support for UEFI Secure\n  Boot technology.  The Ubuntu Server image remains as a CD sized image,\n  but installs the base system from a squashfs image for improved\n  performance.\n\nFrom the release announcement \"Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) released!\" by Kate Stewart.\nFor more information, see the 12.10 download page. (Note also that the cdimage.ubuntu.com download page for 12.10 has no DVD, image, only server images for the community-supported OMAP3 and PPC architectures.)\nAlthough the alternate CD is gone, users wishing to install Ubuntu non-graphically may still use the Server CD or (as may be preferable for non-server systems) the tiny Minimal CD (mini.iso).\n", "Q: Why do we use ctrl + c / ctrl + x / ctrl + z in terminal? Why do we have to use all this shortcut to quit the programs in terminal ?\nFor example :\n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl+c in order to quit top\n\n*ctrl+z in order to quit man\n\n*ctrl+x in order to quit nano\nctrl+c isn't suppose to kill the program ?\n\nA: +z and +c are shell signals.\nctrl+z is not killing the program, it is sending it a signal (SIGTSTP) to suspend.

A signal is a \"flag\" you provide to the process that gets interpretated and associated with an action. \n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl-C sends SIGINT, a signal that causes the process to terminate.\n\n*Ctrl-Z sends SIGTSTP, a signal this causes the process to suspend execution. In this case, it is resumable - try executing a command that will take a while and press Ctrl-Z; you'll see something in the lines of \n[1]+ Stopped [your command]. \nType fg in your Terminal and you'll see the process resuming, if it didn't end before resuming it.\n\n*Ctrl-X, in this case, is the shortcut nano uses to exit the process. Incidentally, there is a signal associated to Ctrl-x, but it's not related to nano.\nTL;DR It's specified in POSIX.\n", "Q: Problems with Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 and Maximus I'm currently running Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 and I also installed Maximus because I greatly value every square inch of window space (I'm greedy like that).

Can't get it to work using chrome or firefox.\nHow do I get this to work? \n\nA: Netflix should be easy to install. From omgubuntu.co.uk (more details on all the specifics for this in the link). A summary for installing Netflix: \nPrerequisites\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 LTS* or 14.10 Alpha\n\n*Google Chrome Beta or Dev (v37+)\n\n*An active Netflix subscription or trial\n\n*Have ‘Prefer HTML5‘ selected in ‘Netflix Account > Playback’\n\n*For 14.04 you also need to update libnss3.\n\n\nAnd after installing these all you need to do is change the user agent string with these details (the link above uses a user agent changer webapp for that):\n\n\n*\n\n*Name: Netflix Linux\n\n*String: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/38.0.2114.2 Safari/537.36\n\n*Group: (is filled in automatically)\n\n*Append?: Select ‘Replace’\n\n*Flag: IE\n\n\nIt is a little bit more difficult than installing a package. But not so difficult that a Linux user would have trouble getting this up and running. \n", "Q: What is the difference between Analog Input and Internal Microphone? I am running Ubuntu 14.04, and my sound works just fine. However, when I open the Sound dialog, I notice that under Input there are two available options\n\nAs far as I can tell, my laptop has an integrated microphone and a small port where I can connect an external microphone, but this does not explain the two entries since I think they are both receiving input from the built-in microphone.\nSo, what is the difference?\nAddition: I should note that both of the actually work just fine. I did some more investigation using pavucontrol which actually gives three options \n\nI still don't quite understand what is going on, and why there are additional options. Perhaps a pulse expert can jump in?\n\nA: On the computers I have tried, Pulseaudio always use internal mic as audio input until a physical jack is connected to the external input jack plug: then it autoswitch to this external input, muting the internal mic.\nIn other words, there are 2 settings but only one is active depending on the external input jack connection.\n\nA: If you have a microphone plugged in, or have a laptop that has a built in microphone (which you do) it's most likely going to be the analog one.  The internal one is likely a sound card or something, and doesn't actually pick up sound.  I have 5 different sound outputs, but only 1 that will work currently.  However, I only have one input device.  It tends to vary on each PC as to what hardware they will have equipped.  I wouldn't worry about it, as I'm sure it's not causing any issues.  \n", "Q: Allow one process access to /dev/uninput without completely compromising security Steam In-Home-Streaming was turned back on the other day. This allows you to play games being rendered on one computer on another computer (commonly playing games on a TV/Media Centre that are being rendered on a big noisy desktop in another room). That all works great except for input.\nSteam reads input on the client and sends it to the remote Steam instance. Fairly simple stuff except that in order to read the raw input and inject it at the other end, both instances of Steam need read/write access to /dev/uninput:\n\nIn order to support streaming game controllers on a Linux host computer, /dev/uinput or /dev/input/uinput needs to be readable and writable by Steam.\n\nThis leaves me in a bit of a quandary.

I have lots of stuff in my crontab, including some that talks to my screen. If I'm not there for it to be notifying, I don't really want it to run.\nIs there a way I can check to see if the computer is locked, so I can keep it from doing things when I'm not at my desk? Or, alternately, do other things only when I'm not at my desk?\nYes, I asked this question before. I am now on Ubuntu 14.04 and Unity, and the environment has changed. When I run gnome-screensaver-command -q, I get The screensaver is inactive whether the workstation is locked or not. A new environment requires a new answer.\n\nA: I looked through the packages mentioning unity (apt-cache search unity), ignoring anything with lib, lens, etc. in the name. unity-services caught the eye. One of the files in this package is /usr/share/upstart/sessions/unity-panel-service-lockscreen.conf, an Upstart job containing:\ndescription \"Backing Service for the Unity Panel\"\nauthor \"Andrea Azzarone <andrea.azzarone@canonical.com>\"\n\nstart on desktop-lock\nstop on desktop-unlock\n\nrespawn\nexec /usr/lib/unity/unity-panel-service --lockscreen-mode\n\nAs you may have guessed, this job is run when the screen is locked.

Note that unity-panel-service is always running, but when you lock the screen, another instance is started with that option. So something like:\nif pgrep -cf lockscreen-mode\nthen \n    # do stuff\nfi\n\npgrep -f searches the complete command line, so we can search for the option.\nI think in this case the manpage of unity-panel-service is wrong or outdated. It says:\n\nunity-panel-service takes no options.\n\n\nUse an Upstart job\nYou can work off the above job configuration to write your Upstart job. Create a session job (say some-job) ~/.config/upstart/some-job.conf containing:\ndescription \"Some script to be run when screen gets locked\"\n\nstart on desktop-lock\nstop on desktop-unlock\n\nscript\n    # do stuff\nend script\n\nA converse script with the start and stop events swapped can be used to run things when the screen is unlocked.\n", "Q: can't use 1080p. only 1024 on 768 i installed ubuntu 14.04 on my old htpc and for some reason i cannot output 1080p video.\ni already tried going to the display settings, though my highest available resolution was 1024 on 768.

If you could post your system specs in your answer, it would help a lot.  Also post if you have integrated or on board graphics, and let me know if you have them disabled or not(If you know).  \nI've found that manual installs work best for installing nvidia drivers, so go to here and download the latest drivers.  By default, it'll most likely go into /Downloads, but if not, just know where it is.  Then, you'll want to press \n\nctrl + alt +F1-F6 (each is a different login)\n\nAnd then sign in to your account.  Then, you'll want to use\n\nsudo stop lightdm (or sudo service lightdm stop)\n\nThis shuts down the things that are using the GUI, so they can be updated.\nThen run\nchmod +x ~/* Folder that said driver is located in * / * Driver *\nFor example,\n\nchmod +x ~/Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run\n\nMake SURE that you have the entire name of the driver, otherwise this will not work!  Caps do matter!\nWhat you just did was make the file executable.  Next, you'll want to run the following command, changed of course like the example above to fit your directories/driver versions.\n\nsudo sh ~/Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run\n\nFor me, tabbing the rest of the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-343.13.run file does not work for me, but it is CRUCIAL THAT YOU DO THIS.  If nothing happens after you run the second command, check your caps and spelling to make sure they are right.  You have to go through the program using the keyboard to correctly install it.  For me it will tell me that something went wrong right on the bat, just keep going and see if it still works.  If it asks you to install 32 bit libraries, do so.  Some programs (like steam games) will not run unless you have these installed.\nAfter all of the above has been done, one final command must be completed, or of course you could reboot.  \n\nsudo start lightdm (or sudo service lightdm start)\n\nThen, you'll do\n\nctrl + alt+ F7-F9ish (F7 is usually default, some people have different F keys though)\n\nIf you have an AMD card, or integrated or onboard graphics let me know as they are a lot different to install.  I've never personally installed AMD drivers before, so I would recommend googling around on how to install them before asking for more help on installing those drivers.  \n", "Q: Which more can I remove from my /boot in order to get space?

It cannot read that your partition is there, so it thinks it is blank space.  The reason you booted to Windows automatically is because Windows over-rid your grub boot loader.  You can fix this by booting into your Ubuntu install disc/USB and then installing Boot repair.

What I have: old MacBook (3,1), Intel Core 2 Duo, 2GHz, 1 processor. OS: 10.5.8\nThe macbook is old and has a lot of problems (ignoring the fact that the OS cannot be updated without paying, the disk cannot be fragmented without formatting [which would make me lose the OS anyway, as I don't have a CD to reinstall it] so I cannot arrange a dual boot [yes, I have tried every conventional and unconventional way to resize/partition/etc.]).\nThus, I'd like to wipe out the entire OS and install Ubuntu. However, I'm wondering whether I need to be wary of some incompatibilities. More concretely, I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will the webcam and microphone work?

No need to wipe anything, it will leave you Mac OS untouched.\nIf the webcam doesn't work in the live session it isn't an indication that it's impossible to make it work, but if it does in the Ubuntu live session it most certainly will in the Ubuntu installation (no matter if you wipe Mac OS or keep it in dualboot).\n", "Q: Error playing video from TeckNet webcam I bought this TeckNet C016 webcam and I'm having trouble getting it to work. Before buying it, I checked to see if anyone else was using it with Linux and there were positive results.\nWhen I plug the webcam into my PC, I am able to turn a little wheel which activates the LEDs so it's getting power. When it's plugged in, I can see a video0 entry in /dev/ (though sometimes it appears as video1)\nI have Cheese and VLC installed.

Use an Alias\nWith this method you only have one virtual host file and define an alias for your secondary site. An Alias will point to a different directory when you specify the Alias in the url. In this case the url: localhost/grafana will take you to your grafana site.\nA simplified version of your virtual host files would look like\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n    ServerName localhost\n\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/defaultSite\n\n    <Directory /var/www/defaultSite>\n            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n            AllowOverride All\n            Order allow,deny\n            allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\n    Alias /grafana  /path/to/grafana\n    <Directory /path/to/grafana>\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\n\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n2. Separate virtual host file and edit client hosts file\nYou can also define different virtual hosts files and use the ServerName parameter to decide which one to serve. In this configuration Apache looks at the hostname part of the url. So you need to change the client so that you can use a different url to get to it. So you would have two virtual host files like the one above MINUS the Alias stuff. In the default site the ServerName would be localhost and for the grafana site the ServerName would be grafana\nThen on your client (which is also the server here) you need to edit /etc/hosts and add the line:\n127.0.0.1    grafana \nNow the url http://grafana will point to localhost. Apache will know to use the virtual host file that uses grafana as the ServerName and the correct site will be served.\nI prefer the Alias method because it is so easy to add a new one at any time. The clients do not need to be edited to access the site.\nHowever the ServerName option make the url a little cleaner, but every client needs to have their hosts file updated. \n", "Q: Run a web server from any directory I am writing a small website, but I do NOT want to figure out how to install and configure complete LAMP stack to test the website from my ~/home directory.

To determine the speed of the unadorned drive, you can use the\nhdparm -t --direct /dev/sda\n\n\n*Some drive properties can be changed while the device is in operation; for example, most drives allow you to turn power management on and off. Just which functions hdparm can change and activate on a hard drive can be called up with\nhdparm -I /dev/sda\n\nand are found under Commands/features (Figure 1). All functions found there and marked with an asterisk are currently active, and hdparm can use the rest or at least activate them.\nTo speed up data transmission, a hard disk usually reads several sectors at the same time. How many it can deliver at the same time is revealed by\nhdparm -I /dev/sda\n\nand is listed after R/W multiple sector transfer: Max =. This value should also be found in the same line after Current =. If that is not the case, you can increase the value with:\nhdparm -m16 /dev/sda\n\nThis instructs the hard drive always to deliver 16 sectors at once.\nCuriously, some hard drives run slower with higher values: The hdparm man page mentions primarily older Caviar drives from Western Digital. In such cases, you should reduce the number of sectors again or even turn the function off completely, which is done with:\nhdparm -m0 /dev/sda\n\nBeyond this, modern drives can even retrieve a few sectors in advance (“read ahead”). To define how many, use the -a switch (Figure 4, top) – for example:\nhdparm -a256 /dev/sda\n\nHere, the drive will read the 256 sectors in advance that are most likely the next to be requested. Higher values speed up above all the reading of large files – at the cost, however, that reading smaller ones takes longer. The current setting is shown with\nhdparm -a /dev/sda\n\nBeyond that, many drives also possess a built-in, additional read-ahead function. As a rule, therefore, you can leave the setting at the default value.\nHow fast queries from the operating system reach the hard drive controller can be called up with\nhdparm -c /dev/sda\nThe value should be 32-bit; you can force this value with the -c3 switch.\n\n*Many modern hard drives allow you to slow down the head movement. Although doing so will increase access times, it will also reduce the noise level. To find out whether your own hard drive offers this “acoustic mode,” you can use this command:\nhdparm -M /dev/sda\n\nIf a number follows the equal sign, as shown in Figure 4 (bottom), the drive can be put into a quiet mode with:\nhdparm -M 128 /dev/sda\n\nTo reach the highest speed, use the maximum value:\nhdparm -M 254 /dev/sda\n\nValues between 128 and 254 are allowed, resulting in a trade-off between noise level and speed. Incidentally, your Linux kernel must also support acoustic management, which should be the case for all current major distributions.\nSome CD and DVD drives turn out to be more like turbines: Their high-speed rotation can hinder audio/video enjoyment. The\nhdparm -E 4 /dev/sr0\n\ncommand will provide relief. The parameter 4 determines speed, and /dev/sr0 specifies the DVD drive. This example slows drive reading speed ninefold.\n\n*With write-back caching, the hard drive first stores the data to be written in a buffer. In this way, it can accept data much faster, which in the end leads to a faster write speed. The\nhdparm -W /dev/sda\ncommand shows whether write-back caching is active with a 1 after the equals sign; otherwise, you can activate the function with the -W1 switch.\nIf hdparm will not allow this change, you need to make sure that write-back caching has been activated in the BIOS. However, this function is not recommended for all situations: In the case of a power outage, the data in the buffer would be lost permanently.\nIf a program sensitive to data loss – such as a database – is running on the system, you should turn off the write-back cache with the -W0 switch. Documentation for the PostgreSQL database even explicitly recommends that this be done.\n\n*If a hard disk or SSD doesn’t have anything to do for a certain period of time, it automatically enters sleep mode. This power-saving feature can be influenced with the -B parameter. Thus, using:\nhdparm -B255 /dev/sda\nwould deactivate energy management; however, not all drives allow this.\nInstead of 255, values between 1 and 254 are allowed. A higher value means more power is used but also promises higher performance or speed. Values between 1 and 128 allow the drive to shut down, whereas values from 129 to 254 forbid that from happening.\nThe most power can be saved with a value of 1; the highest rate of data transmission (I/O performance) is achieved with 254. You can call up the current value with:\nhdparm -B /dev/sda\n\nThe specific effect the different values will have depends on the drive itself. However, you should keep in mind that too many shutdowns are not good for desktop hard drives: Each time it shuts off, the drive must park the heads, which increases wear and tear. Consequently, you shouldn’t wake your hard drive up every two seconds – which always takes more than two seconds to do.\nYou can set how many seconds of idleness the hard drive should wait before it goes to sleep with the\nhdparm -S 128 /dev/sda\nswitch; however, this value here is not in seconds but a number between 1 and 253. The hard drive multiplies this value by another. The value chosen in the example, 128, lies between 1 and 240, for which the drive uses a factor of five. Consequently, it would shut down after 640 seconds of idleness.\nFrom 241 and up, the multiplication factor increases steadily. At 251, the waiting period has increased to 5.5 hours. At 253, the value is preset by the manufacturer, usually between eight and 12 hours. The value 254 is left out; at 255, the drive will wait 21 minutes and 15 seconds. A value of 0 will deactivate sleep mode completely. To send the hard drive to sleep immediately, enter:\nhdparm -y /dev/sda\n\nWith a capital Y, the drive will go into an even deeper state of sleep. Depending on the drive, the drive might only wake up from a deep sleep after a reset of the whole system.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Fullscreen Problem I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my system! The problem is that whenever I put a Flash Player type video full-screen on my second screen, and click away from it on my first screen, it automatically minimises, and it's getting extremely annoying. It really breaks work-flow, and I can't videos shows in full size while working on something else. Help, please!\n(Using Firefox)\n\nA: If you switch to Google Chrome, there is a hack at https://github.com/ali1234/fullscreenhack that works for PepperFlash.

I have installed wordpress on LAMP. \nAs I am new one to Ubuntu.

Use www-data.\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www\n\nThere is a difference between the database user and the Apache user. The Apache User is the only one who can actually read the files. The database user is only meant for giving/taking database read/write permissions.\nIn addition, keep the default permissions from the webapp install. Do not change those, except for the owning user/group. If you are instructed by the webapp, change permissions.\n\nIf you are more concerned about security, you could instead run the following commands:\nsudo chown -R $USER:www-data /var/www\nsudo chmod -R 640 /var/www\n\nThis makes the actual files owned by your user, so that only you (and root) can modify them. The reason www-data is referenced is so that Apache can still READ the files, but not actually write to them. \nThe 640 allows you (the file owner) to read and write, while allowing the www-data group to read files. It also blocks anyone else from possibly reading the file contents.\n(The above is only one possible (untested) method.

After a couple seconds I would like the terminals to close. I am at a loss and I believe it can't be done, however I figured I'd ask. \nThis is what I have so far, however after I run it the process id's are considered incorrect and I believe it's because gnome-terminal forks the process to bash and I am not capturing that pid.\nipaddress=$1\nport=$2\nprocessarray=()\necho \"netcat command set to ip: $ipaddress and port: $port\"\nif [ -z \"$ipaddress\" ]; then\n    echo \"No ip address entered\"\nfi\nif [ -z \"$port\" ]; then\n    echo \"No port entered default set to 0\"\n    $port=0\nfi\nfor i in {0..9}; do\n    gnome-terminal -e \"bash -c \\\"netcat $ipaddress $port; exec bash\\\"\" & processarray+=  (\"$!\")\ndone\n\nsleep 10;\nfor i in \"${processarray[@]}\"; do\n    kill \"$i\"\ndone\n\n\nA: That's because gnome-terminal is \"clever\". When you fire up gnome-terminal, it will determine if another instance of gnome-terminal is already running.\n\n\n*\n\n*If no, it creates a new gnome-terminal process and spawns a window.\n\n*If yes, it will simply cause that existing gnome-terminal process to spawn a new window.\n\n\nTherefore, all gnome-terminal windows run as a single process, with a single PID.\nYou can easily check this by opening up several gnome-terminal windows, then get their PIDs by issuing xprop _NET_WM_PID somewhere and click inside them. You will see the PID is the same for all windows.\nSo what happens in your script?\nYou're capturing the PIDs of the gnome-terminal instances you launch alright, but the problem is, those PIDs exist only for the fraction of a second. These processes only cause the existing gnome-terminal process to spawn a new window, then terminate.\nSo if you already have an active gnome-terminal process when executing your script (which I assume), the PIDs you collect don't exist anymore when you try to kill them. If you don't (say, you execute that script from an xterm or some other terminal emulator), the first PID you collect will indeed be \"correct\". The following PIDs you collect will be \"incorrect\". Once you enter your killing loop, the first iteration would kill all gnome-terminal windows, and the following ones would output errors, because those PIDs don't exist anymore.\nSo, how to solve this?\nWell, off the bat I can think of two ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't insist on using gnome-terminal, use some other terminal emulator instead which doesn't behave in this way. xterm for example spawns a separate process for each window. If you use xterm rather than gnome-terminal in your script, it should work. Easy & clean.\n\n*If you do insist on using gnome-terminal, the way to kill a specific gnome-terminal window would be to kill the process that's running inside that specific window. As soon as you terminate that process, that window will close. But since you are using that -e option, this process will be netcat $ipaddress $port first, then afterwards bash, and it is hard to get the PIDs. You can't easily collect them as you are currently doing with $!. You could try something like killall netcat or killall bash, but clearly that will also terminate all other netcat or bash instances, which you probably don't want. You could possibly grep over some cleverly designed ps call to try and find the exact PIDs you want to kill, but that's shaky and error-prone. Honestly, I'd just go for solution 1.\nTwo minor comments on your script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Line 10: It should be port=0, not $port=0.\n\n*Line 13: It should be processarray+=(\"$!\"), not processarray+=  (\"$!\").\nHope that helps.\nEdit: Oh, I just found the --disable-factory option for gnome-terminal, which causes it to not re-use existing processes. Here's your fixed script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nipaddress=$1\nport=$2\nprocessarray=()\necho \"netcat command set to ip: $ipaddress and port: $port\"\nif [ -z \"$ipaddress\" ]; then\n    echo \"No ip address entered\"\nfi\nif [ -z \"$port\" ]; then\n    echo \"No port entered default set to 0\"\n    port=0\nfi\nfor i in {0..9}; do\n    gnome-terminal --disable-factory -e \"bash -c \\\"netcat $ipaddress $port; exec bash\\\"\" & processarray+=(\"$!\")\ndone\n\nsleep 10;\nfor i in \"${processarray[@]}\"; do\n    kill \"$i\"\ndone\n\n\n", "Q: Can I set up a different password to login with?

Is there a way to do the same thing on ubuntu- create different ways to login?\n\nA: You can create as many accounts as you wish. Log in as a non-admin user if you wish. For the most part this is not necessary as, unlike other OS, the admin account does NOT run with elevated privileges, it just has the ability to escalate privileges (using sudo).\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\nYou can not easily do what you envision in Debian/Ubuntu, but you can with RHEL/Fedora using selinux.

But first, we'll make sure that it is released by executing this command:\nsudo /sbin/dhclient -r wlan0\n\nThen to request a new one from your DHCP server, simply do:\nsudo /sbin/dhclient wlan0\n\n(Assuming that your wireless interface is called wlan0. If it isn't, take a look at the output of iwconfig and find out the name of the entry that has wireless information next to it).\nThat command should complete fairly quickly and you'll see that an IP address has been assigned to your interface. Now try browsing the internet.\n", "Q: How to fix authentication password, when password is rejected? When I try to upgrade, I am prompted for authentication password.

I am finding libre\noffice  too slow when hd images are loaded for project work, the pages moves in a very slow motion and if give command it takes 2-3 sec to execute it.\n\nA: \nwhy libre office need to be uninstalled while installing apache office. \n\nLibreoffice (LO) and Apache OpenOffice (OO) are basically the same software.  If you want both you need to install one of the 2 from source.\nTo understand why you need to know a bit of the history of both...\nSun Microsystems was bought by Oracle in 2011. Oracle then renamed the (proprietary) StarOffice office suite to Oracle Open Office and then killed the software. \nMost of the volunteers left the project and formed LibreOffice. So LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice.org and is built on the original OpenOffice.org code base. \nUbuntu (and most of the other Linux systems) started using LibreOffice.\nAfter a while Oracle gave the OpenOffice.org trademarks and code to the Apache Software Foundation. Apache OpenOffice is now being developed under the Apache license.\n\nAny differences?\n\n\n*\n\n*different default theme\n\n*OpenOffice starts with a sidebar. LibreOffice does not; you need to enable it.\n\n*LibreOffice has a status bar at the bottom of the window with live-updating word count. OpenOffice does not. You need to select Tools -> Word Count to view the word count and it will not update nor show itself automatically.\n\n*LibreOffice has support for font embedding.\n\n\nYou can see here that these are just minor minor minor details. Both suites still use the same code base with the same names for modules, libraries and everything else. So they cannot exist on the same machine using the same installation tool.\nIf you want you can install LibreOffice and OpenOffice both, but 1 of these needs to be built from source so you can install it on another location (like in /opt).\nHow about the license?\nThe Apache OpenOffice project uses the Apache License, while the LibreOffice project uses a dual LGPLv3 / MPL license. So LibreOffice can take OpenOffice’s code and incorporate it into LibreOffice.\nThe two different licenses only allow a one-way transfer of code. LibreOffice can add code from OpenOffice. OpenOffice can not incorporate code from LibreOffice. This is the result of the different licenses the projects chose.\nThis should explain why you can not use both at the same time using the normal installation tools. \nNow for your problem. It is too vague, so I would suggest to post a new one with details and including some information about what you seem to claim to be slow.\n\nthe pages moves in a very slow motion and if give command it takes 2-3 sec to execute it.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*if LibreOffice is slow so will OpenOffice be. There is not a lot difference between them. Nothing to make it slow. In case removing LibreOfice and installing OpenOffice makes it quick, re-installing LibreOffice will make it quick again too. If NOT this is a BUG and should be reported so it can be fixed.\n\n*you assume it is LibreOffice that is slow. But it could also be your system that is not fast enough. There is no information about your system in your post, so there is nothing to go on.\n\nA: If performance issues are the main problem, you should first try to tackle them directly: In LibreOffice Writer, go to Menu Tools -> Options -> LibreOffice -> View, and check if Hardware acceleration is enabled and Anti-Aliasing is disabled.\nIf this isn't sufficient, think about hiding the hi-res pictures when working with a writer document. Go to Menu Tools -> Options -> LibreOffice Writer -> View, and disabled \"Graphics and objects\" under \"Display\".\n", "Q: 'error unrecognized service' when trying to test cluster I am trying to follow the instructions on Cloudera's website here [1] to\nset up a test cluster in pseudo distributed mode.

Its not really a big deal, but its annoying. I got asked for my wifi login credentials during each startup even though Ubuntu remembers my username login and password.\nThis happens even before I login into the system. And it does not even matter wheter I enter the wifi password of not. If I just click \"cancel\" on that dialog and then login to the system, its going to connect to the wifi anyway (automatically). I am just trying to get rid og the dialog. \nAny tips?\n\nA: Network Manager saves the passwords in your keyring, which doesn't get unlocked until you login. You can stop it from connecting before you login by unchecking \"Available to other users\" in the connection settings.\nAlternatively, you can tell it to store the password unencrypted by opting for \"Store the password for all users\" in the password field of the Security tab of the network's configuration details:\n\n\nA: Two solutions (both tested only on Ubuntu 14.10!):\n\n\n*\n\n*Unchecking \"Available to other users\" in the connection settings (go to \"Edit connections\" in Network Manager menu).  Slight problem (at least on Ubuntu 14.10): for some reason, the connection does not connect automatically, when you log in. I have to do it manually, even though the \"Automatically connect to this network when it is available\" box is checked.\n\n*cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\nsudo nano <your_connection_name>\n\nThen find the section [802-1x]. Set the field password-flags=0. That's it. If you now reconnect to your wireless connection and check this connection file again you will see that a password-flags field was replaced by password=<your_password>. The password is in plain text, but the file is readable only by root, so it should not be a problem.  \n\nA: Not sure it this also works on 14.04, but 15.10 has options in front of the wireless password field (accessed by clicking the small HDD icon) where you can choose if you want to store the password just for yourself or for every user. If you store the password for every user, it should automatically connect to the network.\n\nA: I just did the following changes:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAnd changed:\nblacklist rtl8192cu\n\nto \nblacklist rtl8192c_common\n\nrtl8192cu and rtl8192c_common conflicted each other, so I added them to the blacklist.\nFİnally shutdown my computer, and when I start up problem solved.\n", "Q: How do I install over an encrypted disk? I got a new (old) laptop, and was excited to try something new. So I gave Zorin OS a shot. However the initial charm wore off and I decided to move to Ubuntu (or maybe Mint?).

I've seen some recommendations for decrypting the disk first, but (1) it sounds like a lot of work, and (2) I have nothing sensitive on the fresh install of Zorin to lose. If it's better to decrypt the drive then I'll do it. But I'd rather cut my losses and move on.\nAlso as a side note, do I need any special considerations installing over a previous distro?

For some reason I was being locked out of manually changing the date/time through the GUI. The button [Unlock to change these settings] that allows a manual change would not unlock. That issue went away.\n\nA: First of all, this is a must-read for those needing to keep time consistent in VMs:\nTimekeeping in Virtual Machines\n\nHow often does the date/time get checked when Ubuntu is set to do it automatically?\n\nThat depends entirely on how you do it, as there are multiple ways to keep your time in sync:\n\n\n*\n\n*ntpdate using cronjob\n\n*ntpd\n\n*VMware tools\n\n*something else that I don't think of right now\n\n\nI recommend using ntpd. In that case, the poll interval is variable:\n\nBy default, ntpd runs in continuous mode where each of possibly several external servers is polled at\n  intervals determined by an intricate state machine. The state machine measures the incidental\n  roundtrip delay jitter and oscillator frequency wander and determines the best poll interval using a\n  heuristic algorithm. Ordinarily, and in most operating environments, the state machine will start\n  with 64s intervals and eventually increase in steps to 1024s. A small amount of random variation is\n  introduced in order to avoid bunching at the servers. In addition, should a server become unreachable\n  for some time, the poll interval is increased in steps to 1024s in order to reduce network overhead. \n\nSource: ntpd manpage\n", "Q: Help with install on a non working windows compter How do I install Ubuntu on a non working windows computer??

In most cases it is the current user's home directory. This home directory is part of a bigger tree that starts in / (the \"root\" directory). to see what is the current directory, type in the terminal:\n~$ pwd\n\nmy result is:\n/home/jacob\n\nOnly if I cd to another directory which is directly below the current directory (a subfolder), I do not need to include the current directory:\n~$ cd Downloads\n\nworks:\n~/Downloads$ (which is in fact: /home/jacob/Downloads)\n\nHowever, in any other case I need to use the full path. for example when I want to cd  (\"sideways\") from the Downloads folder to the Dropbox folder :\n~/Downloads$ cd Dropbox\nbash: cd: Dropbox: Bestand of map bestaat niet (saying it does not exist)\n\nBut when I use the full path\n~/Downloads$ cd /home/jacob/Dropbox\n~/Dropbox$\n\nIt works.\nThe easy way to work with files and directories\nTo easily cd to another directory, simply open a terminal window, type cd and drag the directory from a nautilus window's bar over the terminal window:\n\ngives you:\n\nSimilarly, you can drag a file over the terminal window to include its full path (gnome-terminal).\nUsing the tilde (~)\nAnother way to reduce the amount of \"typing work\" is to use the tilde instead of typing out your home directory. An example:\ninstead of:\n/home/jacob/Downloads/somefile\n\nI can use:\n~/Downloads/somefile\n\n\nA: Typing 'ls' is handy because it lets you know the name of the directory under linux.  Also remember that, if your directory / file name contains spaces, then use the forwardslash.  For example My\\ Documents.  If you want to copy/paste you can too - just remember that in most terminal programs it's control+shift+c and control+shift+v.\nAs far as untarring files - tar.gz and tar.bz2 are just compression formats - like zip.  You can use a program called 'Archive Manager' to unpack them, but if you want to use the command line you can use the following commands (for the different types of tar files):\ntar xzf filename.tar.gz\n\ntar xjf file.tar.bz2\n\nHope that gets you started.

Thanks for your answers!\n\nA: The \"problem\" is with your video card, it does not do 3d graphics. To compensate it uses llvm which uses your CPU rather then your video card to do 3d rendering. The result is your display is slow. Previous versions of unity and gnome did had a 2d fall back mode, but they have been phased out.\n\"gnome\" - both gnome shell and unity - use llvm (llvmpipe) and both will be slow.\nPersonally, I use KDE which is a balance of eye candy and speed. Other options are xfce or lxde. \nkde (kubuntu) is a great spin, xubuntu, and lubuntu will all perform more reasonable for you and none use llvm (llvmpipe).\nSee http://www.mesa3d.org/llvmpipe.html\n\nA: To minimize your video incongruity, you can install another graphical interface.\nI recommend KDE or MATE for beautiful graphics, and LDXE or Razor-Qt for better performance.\nIn your terminal use:\nKDE:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nMATE: (for programs belong family GNOME)\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://packages.mate-desktop.org/repo/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mate-archive-keyring\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mate-core\nsudo apt-get install mate-desktop-environment\n\nLXDE: (for programs belong family GNOME)\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lxde\n\nRazor-Qt: (for programs belong family KDE)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:razor-qt\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install razorqt\n\nRestart your system.\n", "Q: Skype and Steam won't load - Ubuntu 14.04 I'm a newbie with Linux but have just installed a 32 bit version of Ubuntu onto a old laptop.

I'm going to compile kernel on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit, so I start with installing packages that I need:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential bin86 kernel-package libqt3-headers libqt3-mt-dev wget libncurses5 libncurses5-dev qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev\n\nEverything is installed except libqt3-headers and libqt3-mt-dev packages. For those packages I got in terminal:\nE: Unable to locate package libqt3-headers\nE: Unable to locate package libqt3-mt-dev\n\nI looked around and it seems like there is no those packages in Ubuntu 14.04 repositories.\nAny idea what to do?\n\nA: TL;DR: Based on what you already do have installed, just install pkg-config  and you should be good to go.\nBuilding the kernel uses Qt if you want to configure what goes into your kernel by running make xconfig. (Which you likely do, as this is one of the friendliest ways to do it.)\nAt least for any remotely recent kernel, you can use Qt 4 instead of Qt 3. You should install:\n\n\n*\n\n*libqt4-dev , so the xconfig utility can link against Qt4, and\n\n*pkg-config , so make xconfig can automatically discover the Qt4 headers installed by libqt4-dev and use them.\n\n\nYou can install those packages through the Software Center or with:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libqt4-dev pkg-config\n\n(For more information on make xconfig, see this answer to What's a simple way to recompile the kernel?.)\nYou don't need both Qt3 and Qt4 headers: provided either is installed correctly and the system is configured so they'll be identified by make xconfig (pkg-config is one way to faciliate this), you don't need the other.\nBy the way, though there's no harm in doing so, it's not actually necessary to explicitly install qt4-dev-tools. libqt4-dev declares the other necessary Qt4-related packages, such as libqt4-dev-bin and qt4-qmake, as dependencies, causing them to be automatically installed as well. You also only need the ncurses packages if you're going to run make menuconfig (which is a non-graphical alternative to make xconfig).\nIn your case, you already have libqt4-dev  installed, so you can just install pkg-config .\n\nA: Those packages belong to Qt version 3, which has become obsolete as the current version is 5.3. They are no longer included in repositories.\nI don't know why you would need those packages anyway.\n\nIf you've not built a kernel on your system before, there are some packages needed before you can successfully build.

This feature can be provided either on the filesystem level or partition level.\n\n\n*\n\n*For partition level - google LVM snapshots\n\n*For filesystem level - you need to choose which file system to use.

If you decided to do so you can also manually alter the partitions.\n\nOr is it better to use the default ones that the installer creates? \n\nAs a user of Linux for 15 years, I realized that playing with partitions creates more hassle than it solves, so I would go with default ones.\n\nIf yes, on which partition will my virtual machine be? \n\ndefault partitions for ubuntu Desktop is only one big partition for root and one swap partition. Than it will be obviously in the root partition.\n\nWhen I make a clean install of Ubuntu will it erase my Windows partitions?\n\nif you let Ubuntu to use whole your hardrive, it will erase all your Windows partitions!

Previously whenever I  typed the name of a program that was not installed in the terminal, I would get a list of suggested packages to \"sudo apt-get install\".\nRecently however, whenever I type a program in to try and install it, the terminal just says\nbash: /usr/bin/python: No such file or directory\n\nI'm pretty sure the reason why it's doing this is because a while back I wanted to be able to execute Python scripts in Python 3 without having to explicitly type in python3, but whenever I typed in python it just executed the Python 2 interpreter. I think the file python was a symbolic link pointing to the python2 executable and I tried to change it to the python 3 executable, but somehow I screwed up and now whenever I type in a program that's not installed, it just displays the above message instead of suggesting a package.\nI'm not sure how to fix this so I was wondering it anyone could help. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: /usr/bin/python should be a symbolic link to whatever version of python you wish to use. On my default system, it links to python2.7, which is also in /usr/bin, but is an executable, not a link.  \nI also have python3.4 in /usr/bin; if I wanted to use that instead of python2.7, I would simply redefine the link using the ln command, like so:\nsudo ln -sT /usr/bin/python3.4 /usr/bin/python\n\n-s creates a symbolic link;  -T means treat the target as a normal file, not a directory.\nIf the python link existed, you would need to delete or rename it. \nThis should not have anything to do with the path at all.\nI feel obliged to mention that you should never make modifications using sudo unless you understand what you are doing (especially know how to undo it, or at least write down the exact steps so you can ask), or you are instructed on exactly what to do by a trusted source (and it's best to understand what it's doing even in that case).  That is the whole reason sudo requires special permissions and a password.\n", "Q: how to do Partition in Ubuntu 14.04?

I am running 32-bit Ubuntu 13.10.\nMy system is only running Chromium. However, when I run free -m, it returns:\n              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          5861       4525       1336          0        638       3385\n-/+ buffers/cache:        500       5360\nSwap:            0          0          0\n\nI can not find why there is so much memory being used. Why is this?\n\nA: First off, like @CassioSposito said, you are using 32-bit Ubuntu. You should really be using 64-bit if your processor supports it.\nUbuntu likes eating up RAM because it likes caching things. Ubuntu, in other words, likes storing stuff in memory because it's faster to read/write. It also likes doing this because it doesn't like wasting valuable RAM.\nThe cache size is dynamically fluctuating and is based off of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The amount of memory needed by other programs\n\n*The amount of free memory.\n\n\nUbuntu will use almost all of the free memory for its cache, but it will remove stuff from cache when other programs need the memory.\nIt is perfectly normal behavior. In fact, most modern operating systems do this because it makes the system faster and has no real downsides.\n", "Q: BootOrder in efibootmgr does not show OS-specific options How can I set Ubuntu/GRUB as the active default boot option? My computer automatically boots to Windows.\nHere is image of the efibootmgr output: \n\nI'm running HP Envy dv6 with Intel Core i7 and I want to dual boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Wooo. EFI.\nWhen you initially boot up your computer, enter the BIOS. In there, you want to find the boot order. It's usually called Boot Order or Startup Order.\nOnce you have found that, move the Ubuntu entry to the top of the list.\n\nYour computer may also have a \"Select Boot Device\" feature. If it does (and you can access it), you can also select Ubuntu for a one-time boot.\n\nA: BootOrder: 3001,3002,3003,3004,3006,3007,2001,2001,2002,2003\n\nThis looks odd. You have a lot of active entries (all that have an asterisk), yet only device-specific loaders show up in the boot order. This may indicate that this firmware cannot boot or simply ignores OS-specific loaders.\nUsually the entry created during installation is added as the first option in the boot order. So at least one of the Ubuntu entries should have been in first place (another hint that this firmware might be crippled :( ). BootCurrent: 0002 though actually is Ubuntu and should should work! (…or this may be the 3rd hint that this firmware is crippled.) You can still try to change the order in the firmware settings, if that does not help you would need to install a default boot loader on the ESP in \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.efi.\nI have written about EFI default boot loaders in a few answers here at this site, but I am still in preparation phase for some better answers that will hopefully improve this situation for users facing this issue (non-business laptops seem to be more and more affected by this), sadly I don't have much time currently.\nRod Smith has some good articles about EFI on his page:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gummiboot \n\n*Dealing with Secure boot - Section: Using the Linux Foundation's PreLoader\n\nA: Boot into Windows 8. Open command prompt with administrative privileges. Then type the following command \nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi \nThis will replace Windows boot manager with Grub.

The locate command sounds intuitive. I would expect it to locate files on the filesystem. However, it rarely finds files on the system that are indeed present:\n$ locate ipsec.secrets\n\nThis gives  no results, even when run from filesystem root directory /. The file is indeed present:\n$ whereis ipsec.secrets\nipsec: /usr/sbin/ipsec /etc/ipsec.secrets /etc/ipsec.d /etc/ipsec.conf /usr/lib/ipsec /usr/share/man/man8/ipsec.8.gz\n\nWhy was locate unable to find this file?\n\nA: If you are not able to locate a file that obviously exists\nI see only two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*The file (directory) was created after the last time that the database of locate was updated. By default it is updated once in a day (/etc/cron.daily/mlocate).\nWith enough privilege you can fix it forcing an update  with \nsudo updatedb\n\n\n*The file (directory) was created under a path not scanned by updatedb (case more rare): you can find the keys of the pruned files in the configuration file /etc/updatedb.conf. Search for PRUNENAMES, PRUNEPATHS or PRUNEFS and modify consequently, then update again the database.\nsudo pico /etc/updatedb.conf\nsudo updatedb\n\nOf course even without privilege you can still search for the file, for example scanning all the directories and subdirectories starting from a position with something like \nfind . -name '*ipsec.secrets*'  # to start from the current directory\nfind / -name '*ipsec.secrets*'  # to start from the root # long long \n\nNote that whereis has a hard-coded path (where to search for), so may not always find what you're looking for.\n\nA: updatedb only runs once a day, you need to run it with root privileges to find recent files.\n\nA: Being somewhat lazy and not wanting to run sudo updatedb and, since I have a computer that can work for me, it runs sudo updatedb every 15 minutes so I don't have to.\nUse sudo crontab -e and find this line:\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n\ninsert below it:\n*/15 *  *   *   *     /usr/bin/updatedb\n\nThen press Ctrl+O to save the file (write it Out) and then  Ctrl+X to eXit.\nIf you've just created the files in the last 15 minutes though you will still need to run:\nsudo updatedb\n\n... to manually update the indices used by locate command.\n\nA: My solution was super fast (but maybe not optimal since your sudo updatedb command will take more time). However, you won't miss any file anymore, even if you have multiple partitions (this is handy for me). \nI opened the configuration file of updated (you need sudo  privileges to save the following file): \nnano /etc/updatedb.conf\nI then commented (adding a # at the beginning of the line) all the lines starting with:\nPRUNENAMES\nPRUNEPATHS\nPRUNEFS\nSave the file (CTRL+O, ENTER, CTRL+X). \nI hope this helps someone else.\n", "Q: I'm trying to install VGA driver for s3 virge and thank you in advance.

Ubuntu 14.04 | default ruby 1.9.1 | Jekyll 0.11.2\nJekyll isn't respecting a number of my settings in _config.yml. I'm guessing this is because current Jekyll (gem) version is 2.3.0, but I could be wrong.\nThe specific settings being ignored are:\n\n\n*\n\n*pagination\n\n*destination\n\n\nBoth of these problems mess with the urls created by Jekyll. Is there a way to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safely update Jekyll to the current version (not break Ubuntu)?\n\n*Force Jekyll to recognize my settings?\n\n\nA: As you can see, some applications in Debian/Ubuntu tend to be very old, with Ruby we generally prefer to avoid system packages. There are some very robust Ruby managers like RVM (recommended for beginners) and rbenv which create an isolated Ruby installation in your home directory, so you have everything up-to-date and under control.\nHowever, if you only wish to use Jekyll, packaged version of Ruby will work for you too, you can just install the latest version of Jekyll through RubyGems with a complementary gem command (part of the ruby package).\nFirst you will need development files for Ruby (ruby-dev package) as some Jekyll's dependencies require compilation. Additionally, the latest Jekyll version requires some JavaScript interpreter (e.g. nodejs):\nsudo apt-get install ruby-dev nodejs\n\nNow you have two options. You can install Jekyll globally or locally in your home directory.\nThe global installation is easier since you don't need to configure pretty much anything. Just uninstall the jekyll package and install the jekyll gem with sudo:\nsudo apt-get remove jekyll\nsudo gem install jekyll\n\nThis will install Ruby dependencies into /var/lib/gems/1.9.1 and jekyll executable into /usr/local/bin/jekyll. Then just verify the version of Jekyll by running:\njekyll --version\n\nGlobal installation may seem scary, but it won't cause any problems, especially if you just need Jekyll and don't do any heavy Ruby development.\nThe local installation in your home directory can be done in a few ways, here I will place jekyll executable into ~/bin directory – which should be automatically added into your $PATH.\ngem install --user-install --bindir ~/bin jekyll\n\nWith --user-install option, gems will be installed into ~/.gem/ruby/1.9.1/\n--bindir tells where the executable should go. If ~/bin doesn't exist yet, gem may complain:\nWARNING:  You don't have /home/<user>/bin in your PATH,\n          gem executables will not run.\n\nYou may just need to reload your terminal or logout.\nYou can also add these options to the .gemrc file, so they are always used when running gem:\ngem: --user-install --bindir ~/bin\n\nNote that if you want to use additional plugins for Jekyll and/or wish to use Jekyll for GitHub pages, you should also consider using Bundler to manage your dependencies, as described in this GitHub article.\n", "Q: Need help editing FSTAB and making my new HDD a system wide mount Okay so long story short. I'm trying to set up my Ubuntu 14.04 Server as a time machine backup. I bought a WD RED HDD to use as the HDD where the back ups save. I can see my Ubuntu PC in the list of time machine back up locations but when I try to connect to it, it says \"OSSTATUS error 2\" after researching the error is happening most likely because my WD RED drive doesn't have the right permissions and its location right now is /media/server and I believe it should be /mnt/server if its a system wide mount.

But so far, there's not enough information to give a complete answer.  I have not had experience with permanently mounting USB drives, but I am assuming they are the same, if they do not get removed.  However, I also think that since there is a possibility that they might not be connected, that has to be considered, as you don't want your system to fail to boot due to this possibility.\nNormally, a USB or other removable drive gets mounted automatically in the /media/username/x directory, where x is the label or UUID of the drive.  This appears to be what is happening with your drive, but it's hard to tell as you are not providing needed information.  You need to pay more attention, and be a little more resourceful.  For example, you still have not said whether any data is available anywhere in the /media/timemachine/server/TimeMachine directory.  And it would be nice to see the directory to see if the files are owned by root, which I am only guessing is the case.  If this is the case, then that is the problem that must be addressed.\nBut, if you don't see the files at all, then there is another problem.  But since there is a directory, I'm guessing the files are there, and are mounted.\nThere is a lot of information on Ubuntu.com and also here that you should look at.  It seems to say that, for NTFS drives, you should enter this in /etc/fstab:\nUUID=1B9C57F11BBEC3DB /media/timemachine/server ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0\nBut I'm not sure how to handle a drive that's not available at boot time (I think you would have the option to continue, but I'm not sure).\nAnother option is to use mount or pmount, and possibly run it as a startup task.\nSorry I can't give absolute answers, but if you can provide concrete, useful information, I can probably help you work out the problems.  I just don't have any experience with external USB NTFS drives.\nEdit - reply to first two comments from OP\nOK, sorry about the USB assumption.  Is it more or less permanently connected?\nI'm not sure if it's automatically mounted or not. The way I would tell would be to disable the line in /etc/fstab, and reboot to see if it shows up as mounted.  If it does, I don't know if it will need to be disabled or not; I'd probably not worry about it yet.\nI believe I misled you about changing the permissions of the directory.  I did a little reading, and NTFS does not support file ownership/permissions like linux, so they are set by the mount options (at the time of mounting).  So, the entry in /etc/fstab is important.  \nIf you want to make sure that your entry is the one being used, you could change the mountpoint to /mnt/timemachine (or anything else you prefer).  The name is not important.  What will happen is that the specified directory will become the root directory of your mounted drive, so in this case, I believe it may become /mnt/timemachine/TM.  Once mounted, it is like any other directory. \nIf you do this, you must create the mountpoint before trying to mount it.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/timemachine; then change /etc/fstab from the previous line:\nUUID=1B9C57F11BBEC3DB   /media/timemachine/server   ntfs-3g     defaults,nosuid,nodev,locale=en_US.UTF-8    0   0\n\nto this:\nUUID=1B9C57F11BBEC3DB /mnt/timemachine ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0  \n\nNow what?\nNext, you can check the permissions.  Issue the command ls -l /mnt/timemachine.  \nThe first set of 10 characters of the output is the permissions; the first column is type, like 'd' for directory, or 'l' for link.  Then there are 3 sets of 3 columns, for permissions:\nUser Group Everyone\nRWX  RWX   RWX for Read/Write/Execute.  So, if you see drwxrwxrwx, that means everyone can read or write to it. drwxr-xr-x means only the owner can write, but everyone else can read.  The execute bit for a directory allows you to see the directory.\nNext, is the number of entries in the directories, then the owner and group.  If it says root  root, then unless it also has drwxrwxrwx permissions, you can't write to it.  I think you probably don't care about the owner so much as the permissions, unless you want to do some extra configuration which I can't help with.\n", "Q: Killing 'wineserver' doesn't close the GUI of wine applications When certain applications running under wine crash I usually just kill the process 'wineserver', since I am unable to properly identify specific process names with Windows application (if they even run on different processes - I'm not sure, I know little about this stuff).\nHowever this accomplishes only freeing my CPU usage, since the GUIs are still opened and accessible through the dash, even though they are not responding. So my question is: what process should I kill to get rid of the artifacts from not-running-anymore Wine programs?\n\nA: This is normal because when you run a Wine application it actually loads other apps to work together, each is it's own parent (not related) and each creates it's own childs. So to effectively kill all Wine related processes you need to use the wineserver command that comes with wine.\nInstead of sudo kill -9 wineAppProcessID you would run wineserver -k\nThe -k parameter sends a SIGINT (Interrupt Process) signal. In the case this does not work, the signal is elevated to a SIGKILL (Kill Process Immediately), similar to a Kill -9.\nThe difference is that wineserver will actually search and kill all Wine processes. This is only good if you want to kill ALL wine processes (All wine applications running at the same time).\nHere is an image of pstree -g when running a Wine app (In this case STALKER Call of Pripyat)\n\nIf I do a sudo kill -9 8462 it will only kill the wineserver and leave me with a GUI window stuck on zombie mode. If I however do a wineserver -k it will correctly kill all Wine related processes (8491, 8468 and 8462). For more information about other wine related commands please see How to install and configure Wine? where I took some effort in compiling almost all useful commands, wineserver being one of them.\n", "Q: Lubuntu fglrx drivers not loading I'm running Lubuntu 14.04 on my PC and it doesn't seem to load the fglrx drivers, it only loads the open source drivers.

Specifically, looking at an Alienware 17 at the moment.  I wanted to make sure there was some support for the video card however.\nConfiguration:\n1TB 5400RPM SATA 6Gb/s + 80GB mSATA SSD Caching\n32GB DDR3L at 1600MHz (4 x 8G)\nIntel® Core™ i7-4910MQ processor \nVideo Card: ????\nSpecifically, I'm looking for a card that will support modest graphics acceleration in Linux (any gaming would be done on the Windows partition most likely), but definitely will support Dual-Head, and Dynamic Power Management.\nI've read that the Nvidia drivers are pretty bad atm, so I was considering the AMD Radeon R9 M290X route.  However, I can't seem to find any information on whether it would be supported (even on the AMD website).  I've read in previous posts that the M2XX cards are simply rebranded HD XXXXM cards (Ie R9 M290X == HD 8970M ).  Is this explicitly true?  Like they are literally exactly the same but a different name?  Is the M290X supported under Ubuntu?\nShould there be any problems installing on an Alienware laptop?  I know its been done, but just wondering what I'm probably getting myself into as well.\nThanks for the help!\n\nA: I know this is late but hopefully it will help others if not yourself. Yes, the R9 M290X is a rebranded HD8970M [1]. It shares the Pitcairn core of its desktop brother, the venerable Radeon HD 7870 [1], and so we can look at that chip to determine the support of the this mobile variant.\nAccording to this benchmark [2], the support of this series is already acceptable but also considerably improved over the last few months. The performance of the 7870 is still behind the older 6870, so it stands to reason that because the hardware is better there is room for more optimization in the future. Either way, since you are most likely going to game under Windows, it is certainly good enough for regular desktop use like video acceleration or compositing.\nThe only area I'm not certain of is the BIOS used in Alienware laptops and that could be an issue for installing Linux, but you definitely don't have to worry about the graphics card.\n[1] http://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Radeon-HD-8970M.90656.0.html\n[2] http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=amd_radeon_12nov&num=4\n", "Q: GDEBI Installer error E: xipper: arch-independent-package-contains-binary-or-object usr/bin/extract-xiso\nE: xipper: missing-dependency-on-libc needed by usr/bin/extract-xiso\nE: xipper: debian-changelog-file-missing\nE: xipper: no-copyright-file\nW: xipper: description-synopsis-starts-with-article\nE: xipper: extended-description-is-empty\nW: xipper: unknown-section game\nW: xipper: binary-without-manpage usr/bin/extract-xiso\nW: xipper: binary-without-manpage usr/bin/xipper.gambas\nE: xipper: md5sums-lists-nonexistent-file usr/bin/ripper.gambas\nW: xipper: file-missing-in-md5sums usr/bin/xipper.gambas\nW: xipper: postinst-has-useless-call-to-update-menus\nW: xipper: postrm-has-useless-call-to-update-menus\n\nLintian finished with exit status 1\n\nThe above Lintian output from gdebi.\nIt says dependency is not satisfiable gambas2-gb-form.\ni searched in synaptic manager and found gambas3-gb-form and installed.\nI am trying to install xipper an iso extractor tool for xbox360 iso files but i get dependency error?\n\nA: You cannot install it because there are missing dependencies. \nAs you can see, there is gambas3-gb-form into your repositories, gambas2-gb-form is missing...   :(\nI think you try to install an old version of xipper. \nIf yes, try to install the latest version....    :) \n", "Q: How to turn off headphones, and only leave enabled analog output?

Files I download from torrent sites have the extension .exe I recently tried to download a few torrents from various sites and found that the file extension of all the files I try to download is .exe, which neither transmission nor vuze nor I know what to do with. This does not happen on all sites, but it seems to be the case on all the better/more popular ones. I am aware of the recent shift from torrent files to magnet links and have used magnet links before with no problem. I've searched and searched the web for anyone else having this problem, and the one time someone did seem to be, he was told it must be a virus, and that was as far as the conversation went. Can anyone help me and explain what's going on? Thank you!\n\nA: A number of sites are distributing torrents within a small downloader program. So you do not have to face the unspeakable horror of having a client program.\nDownsides include:\nDoes not work on non-windows machines.\nCan be used to install malware.\nCannot be used to add additional trackers / peers to a torrent you are already downloading. \nI have tried, without success, to find a way to download the .exe and extract the tracker information so it can be used in a client. Either the information is encrypted, compressed or a code is used to download the torrent after you run the exe.\n\nA: If you wish to execute a .exe (alias: PE) on Linux, use Wine (Wine repository).\nUse unsupported Windows software by installing it in a Virtual Machine.\nImportant: executables have the potential to infect your system, scan with ClamAV and download FOSS from your OS repository if possible.\nCracked installers may contain unwanted hidden software, never give them sensitive informations.\n\nComment under here if you have more questions and don't forget to press the left UP arrow and mark as favorite if I helped.\n\n\nA: I'm afraid I can only suggest what you found already. It's a virus (or at least some sort of malware). Are you sure the \"better/more popular ones\" sites you're downloading from are the correct ones? Check the URL. Check with somebody you know, has the correct one.\nAlternatively, check what you're clicking on. Many sites have other things to download. Stuff they get a commission on per install - advertising.\nMake sure you're selecting the torrent file to download or magnet link. Sites can be sneaky and include things that might look like others.\n", "Q: Why Chromium version 37 is shutting down when I search something on Google?
