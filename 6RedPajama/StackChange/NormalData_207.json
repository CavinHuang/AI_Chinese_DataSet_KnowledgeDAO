["Q: Why did my nemo scripts disappeared? If you are using the Nemo file manager from the \"WebUpD8\" PPA (https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/ubuntu/nemo) you might have noticed that you cannot launch your custom scripts any more. The right click doesn't show the \"Scripts\" entry.\n\nA: This is because the PPA has been recently updated (2015-05-29) and the path where Nemo looks for scripts has changed.\nYour old scripts were located in:\n~/.gnome2/nemo-scripts/\n\nNewer versions of Nemo look into:\n~/.local/share/nemo/scripts/\n\nJust copy your old scripts into the new directory and the scripts will be available again:\nmkdir -p ~/.local/share/nemo/scripts/ &&\\\ncp -r ~/.gnome2/nemo-scripts/* ~/.local/share/nemo/scripts/ &&\\\nchmod -R +x ~/.local/share/nemo/scripts/*\n\n\nNote that you might need to restart Nemo for the scripts to appear, just use nemo -q in a terminal.\n", "Q: What are the steps of this command using ; || and && Note: A B C are commands.....\nPlease tell what the step process would be of these commands\nA || B && C = \nA && B ; C = \n\nWhat I am really after is something like this (but would like to understand the steps above):\nIf A fails, then run B, but if A succeeds, then run C\n(How can I do this with \"||\" \";\" and/or \"&&\"?) \nI found information from this link, but it only shows the steps of 2 commands, not 3....\nWhich one is better: using ; or && to execute multiple commands in one line?\n\nA: Linguistically, you can think of statement1 && statement2 by itself as saying \"execute statement1, and if its exit status is 0, then execute statement2.\"  The other statement1 || statement2 syntax by itself translates to \"execute statement1, and if its exit status is not 0, then execute statement2.\"\nThese operators are primarily intended for use within single conditions of if-constructs.  But, they also have use in other places to compress confusing syntax.\nThe semicolon, ;, is just Bash's standard statement separator (e.g. it allows you to put two statements on the same line and run the 2nd immediately after the 1st, barring circumstances irrelevant to this explanation). Any statement after the semicolon will be interpreted nomatter the result (true/false) of the previous return value.\n\nIf A fails, then run B, but if A succeeds, then run C (How can I do\n  this with \"||\" \";\" and/or \"&&\"?)\n\nA && C || B\n\nLet's test it out:\njohn@mypc:~/test$ ls\nfile-A.txt  file-B.txt  file-C.txt\njohn@mypc:~/test$ cat file-A.txt && cat file-C.txt || cat file-B.txt\nfile A content\nfile C content\njohn@mypc:~/test$ rm file-A.txt \njohn@mypc:~/test$ ls\nfile-B.txt  file-C.txt\njohn@mypc:~/test$ cat file-A.txt && cat file-C.txt || cat file-B.txt\ncat: file-A.txt: No such file or directory\nfile B content\njohn@mypc:~/test$\n\nAs you can see, file B's contents were only printed when printing file A failed.  Before we deleted file A, its content printed successfully and only file C's content printed afterward.\nOn the other hand, ; symbols are agnostic of the previous return code. For example given three commands X, Y, Z, X && Y && Z will not execute statement Z if Y (or X) returns a non-zero exit code, whereas (for all intents and purposes) X ; Y ; Z will execute all three independent of command X and Y's exit codes.\n", "Q: Live CD loads and works.

I can also login to one of the shells available using Ctrl+F# but this does not help me get back to my workspace.\nI tried all the solutions mention in this similar post without any success.\n\nA: I think your system were shut-down while system update in process.\nso I suggest you to login in terminal by using Ctrl+Alt+F2, login to you shell\nand execute following command:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nit will repair your packages and get your system back.\n\nA: I concluded that the problem originated from the changes the IT personal at my work put in place to manage a system they are not familiar with. I was not able to narrow down the problem further.  Reinstalling the OS resolved the problem.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Cloud Minimum Servers Ubuntu Cloud states that it requires 7 physical servers. Why is this? Can an Ubuntu Cloud instance be done with less than 7?\n\nA: I can give a partial answer.  The install procedure goes like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first system becomes the MAAS server, as well as having an initial juju bootstrap environment used to start installing Landscape.  MAAS is used to provision the OS on the rest of the systems.\n\n*The second system becomes the Landscape system.  Once Landscape is up and running, you are directed to the OpenStack page in Landscape where you can specify what you want each remaining node's function to be.  The OpenStack page will refuse to proceed to the node picker if Landscape doesn't see 5 free systems registered with MAAS (and some with at least 2 hard drives).\n\n*The remaining 5 nodes become the OpenStack deployment.  People more knowledgeable than me can comment on how the 5 nodes are deployed. :)  I think there were 3 storage/compute nodes, a controller-type node that ran several services, and one other that I can't remember (network exit node?).\n\n\nI was able to install on 6 nodes instead of 7 by setting up the initial MAAS server, then running Landscape inside of KVM on the MAAS server and registering the KVM instance in MAAS.  If you want more detail on how I did this, I can probably dig up my notes.  I tried this with more nodes as well, but it didn't work and I gave up as I had 6 nodes anyways.\nIf you want to install on just a few servers to try out OpenStack, there are other options available like DevStack or OSAD.  If you want to try out Ubuntu Cloud, you will need more systems.\nNote: I ran into an issue where the hardware inventory kernel that MAAS uses to inventory the hardware wouldn't recognize my NIC.  A standard ubuntu server install would recognize it.  I had to buy some different NICs before Landscape would let me proceed.\n", "Q: Registering another user I need to know the correct command to register another user.

Previous server was on Ubuntu 14, I exported a list of packages I installed from there and apt-get installed them on the new server; I also rsync'd most of the files from the old server over as well (I'm thinking I copied over something bad that's messing with my kernel...)\nAnyway, here is the results of my uname -a:  \n Linux ophq 3.19.0-18-generic #18-Ubuntu SMP Tue May 19 18:31:35 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nAnd the results of landscape-sysinfo/logging in screen:\n  Welcome to Ubuntu 15.04 (GNU/Linux 3.19.0-18-generic x86_64)\n  System load:  2.13                Processes:           11\n  Usage of /:   22.6% of 196.64GB   Users logged in:     1\n  Memory usage: 32%                 IP address for eth0: 123.123.123.123\n  Swap usage:   0%\n\n(currently one game server is in use hence the memory usage - I have to reduce how much RAM is allocated to Minecraft from the default values)\nResult of top:\nhttp://ericbarber.me/serverproblem/top.png\nTo add to this - if I hit F and then hit S on 'Process Status' and resort the top lists I have 2 commands listed under 'D'... kworker/u30:0 and kworker/u30:1 which leads me to my kernel assumption...\nI'm totally stumped on why load average is so high - I had my users test on both MC and the CS:GO servers and they aren't experiencing any lag - I also tested the web servers and they're delivering pages extremely fast (in comparison to the old server.)\nI thought it may be an interrupt issue, so here's the results of cat /proc/interrupts:\nhttp://ericbarber.me/serverproblem/interrupts2.png\nAlong with this, another question suggested running grep . -r /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/ and disabling any values above 0...although all my values are 0 unfortunately.\nsame url as above serverproblem/interrupts.png\nI installed perf and did a quick 30 second report - but I don't understand this output too much:\nsame url as above serverproblem/perf.png\nI'll omit CPU info, but it is an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2690, 2 cores, 2gb RAM, and I believe about 500gb harddrive.

Still unsure the root cause as I haven't seen any other reports of this issue, my assumption is when I used rsync from my old 14.10 system a faulty driver was copied over or a faulty kernel file - why 4.0.0 fixes this is beyond me...but at least no more kworker writing every 5 seconds to kern.log and my harddrives.\n\nA: Sometimes the hard disk could be the bottleneck and cause high system load so you might want to look into that.\nYou can check these links for various suggestions about tools you can use to find out whether this is the problem in your case.\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/9428/how-can-i-monitor-hard-disk-load-on-linux\nhttps://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/460/command-line-tool-on-ubuntu-server-to-see-disk-io-stats\n\nA: I recently ran into a similar issue with 14.10 and 15.04 server, traced it to a cheap display adapter (pny geforce 210 pci-E) causing nouveau to freak out anytime a display was not attached to the card. may be unrelated to your issue but after removing the card from my box it cleared up for me\n", "Q: How do I pull photos from my dead phone?

All the fans are running at their max, the CPU cores are up to ~80 degrees celsius.\nIs there any solution for this?\nCurrently I am running Windows 8.1, because of the fact that this is running smoothly, the laptop is constantly cool. However, I want to run Ubuntu.\n\nA: It isn't specific of NVIDIA. What is been overheated are the CPU cores, and also started happening to me with Ubuntu 15.04 running Intel graphics.\nMy brother also has an Intel graphics laptop, and suffers from this problem from a long time ago.

If I change the dhclient.conf timeout to 20 seconds, the machines stay connected for 20 seconds then kill both interfaces (em1 and em1:1). I can do ifdown to both connections & ifup to bring them up, but they will just die again in whatever the dhcp timeout is.\n/etc/network/interfaces has to be like that, DHCP on em1 with an alias or virtual connect for em1:1 that is static. I could set the dhcp timeout to like 9999999999999999999999999999999999999, but eventually it will hit that timeout & bomb. No errors in the log files.\nAny ideas? No Network Mangler suggestions please :)\n\nA: We had a similar issue for an embedded application that we wanted to connect to a DHCP server when available, but also have a static IP on an alias.\nOur final solution was to simply add a script to /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/ that simply restarts the alias.  We tested this with a flood ping and had no dropped packets on the alias even when the DHCP retry caused this script to run.  That entire script follows:\nifup em1:1 @> /dev/null\n", "Q: 14.04 Nvidia graphics drama - How can I get back into the install?

I read this answer explaining that \"sometimes\" root can own something at /home/$USER directory.\nCan anyone give an example how to prove it. Just give a test case when something really bad happens, when I run\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nedit file and save.\nI got many downvotes trying to help OP out and comments flooded in saying that it is a crime to run gedit with sudo.\nCan anyone give a real example?\nI clearly explained why this question is not a duplicate. There is no answer specific to gedit to the linked question.\nAnd it is important to explain why widely used sudo gedit is bad, or not really, etc.\n\nA: Well maybe it's a fantasy, but there are a number of people saying the same thing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why should I use gksudo for Gtk apps instead of sudo?\n\nThere are other times, though, when side effects can be as mild as Firefox extensions not sticking or as extreme as as not being able to log in any more because the permissions on your .ICEauthority changed.\n\n\n*Why should users never use normal sudo to start graphical applications?\n\nSuppose you're running gedit (a graphical text editor) as root. If you run sudo gedit, HOME will continue to point toward your home directory, even though the program is running as root. Consequently, gedit will write configuration files as root into your home directory. This will sometimes result in the configuration files being owned by root and thus inaccessible to you (when you later run the program as yourself and not as root).\n\n\n*How to run a GUI program as a different user (Debian)?\n\nFirst off, don't use sudo or su to change users to run a graphical process, or you're liable to have problems down the line (~/.ICEauthority changing owner is a notable issue). Instead, create a shortcut that uses the following command:\n\n\n*Running Sudo Graphically\n\nWell, to be perfectly honest, most of the time it isn't. For a lot of applications, you can run them the improper way—using sudo for graphical applications and see no adverse side effects.\n...\nThese errors occur because sometimes when sudo launches an application, it launches with root privileges but uses the user's configuration file.\n\nThis mail archive may also be of interest to you.\nSo, let's test it.\n2 brand new virtual boxes. Ubuntu 14.04. Never run firefox on them. What will happen when I run the command sudo firefox?\ntim@Hairy14CVB:~$ sudo firefox    \n(process:4857): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0' failed\n\n...\n\nshutdownObserver@XPIProvider.jsm:2192:13\n\nThis is the same (or at least very similar) for both virtual boxes. While firefox was running, I installed a youtube extension - a featured one. Then I closed firefox, and checked the output.\ntim@Hairy14CVB:~$ ls -la .ICEauthority \n-rw------- 1 tim tim 1336 Jun  4 21:31 .ICEauthority\n\nWell, .ICEauthority is fine! However...\ntim@Hairy14CVB:~$ ls -la | grep root\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Jun  1 20:49 ..\ndrwx------  3 root root 4096 Jun  5 22:41 .dbus\ndrwx------  4 root root 4096 Jun  5 22:41 .mozilla\n\n3 things in my home folder (/home/tim/) are owned by root (.., .dbus and .mozilla). This is the same (or at least very similar) for both virtual boxes.\nSo, does this matter. I wasn't sure, so I ran firefox, like this:\ntim@Hairy14CVB:~$ firefox\n\n(process:4959): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0' failed\nError: Access was denied while trying to open files in your profile directory.\n\nAnd this ugly error:\n\nFor the full terminal output (including firefox babble), see these two pastebins, here and here.\nI can still run firefox as root by the way. But now more files have been changed:\ntim@Hairy14VB:~$ ls -la | grep root\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Jun  3 19:46 ..\ndrwx------  3 root root  4096 Jun  5 22:55 .adobe\ndrwx------  3 root root  4096 Jun  5 22:40 .dbus\ndrwx------  3 root root  4096 Jun  5 22:55 .macromedia\ndrwx------  4 root root  4096 Jun  5 22:40 .mozilla\n\nWas this because I uploaded an image to imgur.com? Not sure.\nHow did I fix this? chown. I don't understand it, but the internet said to do it, and it's a Virtual Box so yolo.\nsudo chown -R tim:tim /home/tim/\n\nAnd that fixed it. Now the output is just the .. file:\ntim@Hairy14VB:~$ ls -la | grep root\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root  4096 Jun  3 19:46 ..\n\nAnd that's the same on my actual computer. Oh, and on my Kubuntu virtualbox:\ntim@Hairy14VB:~$ ls -la | grep root\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 May 16 14:10 ..\n\nWhich I've never even run a sudo command on. So all is well. Just don't run sudo on a GUI application.\nFinal test: run it with the -H and the -i flags:\nsudo -H firefox\n\nand\nsudo -i firefox\n\nAnd good news! Still, the only root \"thing\" is ... And I can run firefox without root.\n\nOP wants me to talk about Gedit.\nI ran\nsudo gedit\n\nThen installed some random plugins. This was the output:\ntim@Hairy14VB:~$ ls -la | grep root\nls: cannot access .gvfs: Permission denied\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root   4096 Jun  3 19:46 ..\n\nNote that I can't even view the ownership of .gvfs so I did this:\ntim@Hairy14VB:~$ sudo ls -la | grep root\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root   4096 Jun  3 19:46 ..\ndr-x------  2 root root      0 Jun  6 10:05 .gvfs\n\nSo running sudo gedit does change a file in my home directory to root.\nI can still open gedit, but this time I get some garbage out:\n(gedit:7422): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to read the recently used resources file at `/home/tim/.local/share/recently-used.xbel', but the parser failed: Failed to open file '/home/tim/.local/share/recently-used.xbel': Permission denied.\n\nAnd that suggests there is another file (~.local/share/recently-used.xbel) that's been changed. I think this is the Recently used list of files and (lucky guess) I now no longer have my list of recently used files:\n\nThere should be a file there called output2.txt.save2.\nMy pronouns are He / Him\n\nA: As far as sudo gedit, nothing dire, just poor practice, especially as of late. How much harder would it be to suggest sudo -H gedit?\n\n-H, --set-home Request that the security policy set the HOME environment variable to the home directory specified by the target user's password database entry. Depending on the policy, this may be the default behavior.\n\nWhat does happen?\nYou get a couple of root owned files in your home folder. One (recently-used.xbel) will likely return to user ownership. This can happen when a file is deleted and re-created. To see what sudo gedit has changed, run find ~ -user root -group root and see what is returned. By default, this is should be nothing.\nWith that command, you may see a couple files owned by root. One would be a new .file, .gvfs, and sooner or later a root-owned ~/.cache/dconf and the aforementioned recently-used.xbel.\nSo no 'the sky is failing' stuff, but still. Now there have been reports that continued use causes other issues but not going to claim what I don't see here.\nAlso note that as of 13.10 a sudo gedit will use the user's gedit config rather than root's gedit config. Again just bad practice so why continue to do so or suggest others do so?\n", "Q: Certain Netbeans Libraries seem to be missing in Ubuntu so program don't work I tried to install the certain libraries for Netbeans to make an application.\nimport java.awt.Canvas;\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionListener;\n\nWhich libraries do I need to install via apt-get\nimport java.awt.image.BufferedImage;\nimport javax.swing.SwingWorker;\nimport javax.swing.Timer;\nimport javax.swing.JComponent;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport org.imgscalr.Scalr;\nimport org.imgscalr.Scalr.Method;\nimport org.imgscalr.Scalr.Mode;\nimport JMyron.*;\n\nWhat netbeans is telling me that it doesn't exist.

I think the netbeans that I installed is lacking the required libraries. Or I just got the wrong version of netbeans.\n\nA: None of that can be installed directly by the package manager and the absence of libraries has nothing to do with Netbeans. The error messages are from the Java compiler.\nSimply add the libraries to your Java project via project properties.

Thank you. \nAlso I don't know if it matters but I am using a Lenovo T430s.\n\nA: I'm sorry to say you've accidentally overwritten your Windows installation. If you had no important data on the disk or if you have adequate backups from which you can restore your personal data, your best bet is to re-install Windows. If you had important personal data on the disk with no backups:\n\n\n*\n\n*STOP USING THE UBUNTU INSTALLATION IMMEDIATELY!! Every moment the computer is booted into Ubuntu, there's a risk that it will overwrite the sectors that still contain your personal data.\n\n*Using an emergency system, make a low-level backup of your disk using dd.\n\n*Use PhotoRec or equivalent Windows-specific software to recover your personal files on a file-by-file basis. I've heard claims that some Windows tools do a better job than PhotoRec at recovering filenames, but I don't have specific recommendations on this score. You may want to ask about it on a Windows forum. Note that this process is going to be extremely tedious and is likely to recover only some of your personal files; it's very likely that some are irretrievably lost.\n\n*Once you've recovered your personal files, re-install Windows and copy the files back to the new installation (or to your Ubuntu installation, if you prefer).\n\n\nNote that this procedure requires you to have at least one disk of equal or greater size to the original to hold the backup and recovered files. If you don't have such a disk already, buy one. You can use it for more conventional backups in the future.\nGood luck with your recovery efforts!\n", "Q: messed up my /user directory permissions an now cannot run sudo or gksu while changing the permissions for the /usr folder\nof owner to root read and write\nof group to root read and write\nof other to read and write  i ignoratly checked to \nbox to propagate to all contained directories/files\nnow I cannot run sudo or gksu,  how can i fix this?\nthe error message when trying to run sudo on a command is:\nsudo: error in /etc/sudo.conf, line 0 while loading plugin `sudoers_policy'\nsudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be only be writable by owner\nsudo: fatal error, unable to load plugins\nhelp!\n\nA: Boot a Live CD/USB or any other linux distro and change the permission back to what they should be.\nSee, no need to reinstall.\n", "Q: Cannot login as administrator when trying to log in with my old user account (administrator) it brings me back to the log in screen.

The three most common, that come to mind, are: change of display manager, display variable, and choice of desktop when trying to login (you may have installed more than one Desktop Environment). \nTo test to see if it is in fact one of those three, boot the computer and when the login manager (unity-greeter) presents itself, type control-alt-F6.\nCtl-Alt-F6\n\nThis will take you to a textual console. You then should type the name of the admin account, and your password. If it will not allow you to login like this then you have an issue with your password or something else.

I have Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 installed in my laptop. The problem is, when I enable fastboot,\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't view Windows partitions from Linux\n\n*When booting up I think grub does something so sometimes Windows saying repairing boot and only shows a blue screen. I have to manually restart to fix it.\n\n\nWhen I disable fastboot,\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows boot takes a very long time!\n\n\nIs there a way to keep fastboot and fix the other issues?\n\nA: Short answer:\nNo.\nLong answer:\nThe \"Fast Startup\" name is something of a misnomer. This Windows feature actually turns shutdown operations into hibernation (suspend-to-disk) operations. As such, filesystem data structures are left in an inconsistent state. When another OS, such as Ubuntu, boots, it sees the disk in an inconsistent state, assumes that the previously-running OS crashed, and will either attempt to repair the disk or refuse to mount it. Thus, the Windows \"Fast Startup\" feature is fundamentally incompatible with a dual-boot setup. In principle, it could be fixed by having Windows sync its disks before doing its suspend-to-disk operation, but this would require changes in Windows, or at least a new third-party utility to add the functionality. I don't know how practical such a change would be, and AFAIK no such feature or add-on tool is available.\nAs a side note, the Windows \"Fast Startup\" feature is entirely different from the firmware feature that's often called \"fast boot\" or \"fast start.\" This firmware feature takes shortcuts on hardware initialization in order to speed up the boot process. For instance, the firmware's fast start might skip initialization of some or all USB devices. This firmware feature usually works fine with Ubuntu, with the caveat that it may be impossible to boot an Ubuntu installer because the firmware won't see the USB flash drive. If you can boot acceptably, though, you can leave the firmware \"fast start\" feature active.\n\nA: Yes. There is a workaround for that.\nWindows \"Fast Startup\" is just hibernation. That's why Windows partitions can not be mounted with read-write permissions.\nBut if you setup /etc/fstab that Windows partitions are mount as read-only, you will \"see\" them. But you will be unable to write there.\nIt may be acceptable or not. But it is the only way to use Ubuntu with Windows \"Fastboot\" enabled.\nIf more detailed explanation on 'fstab' is needed,  you can find it here.\n", "Q: ubuntu isc-dhcp-server expected ip address or hostname I recently replaced my windows server with an ubuntu one and I was setting up dhcp when I ran into this error whilst trying to add a 'reserved' client.\nexpecting IP address or hostname\nJun  6 01:47:27 xee dhcpd: fixed-address:\nJun  6 01:47:27 xee dhcpd:               ^\nJun  6 01:47:27 xee dhcpd: Configuration file errors encountered -- exiting\n\nThis is the section of the config:\nhost temple {\nhardware ethernet ‎BC:5F:F4:A2:29:96;\nfixed-address: 10.1.1.12;\n}\n\nFrom the material I've found online it should all work so I'm not too sure what is happening.\nEdit: here is my entire config:\nddns-update-style none;\n\noption domain-name \"lan\";\noption domain-name-servers xee.home.lan;\n\ndefault-lease-time 600;\nmax-lease-time 7200;\nauthoritative;\nlog-facility local7;\n\nsubnet 10.1.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\nrange 10.1.1.3 10.1.1.253;\noption routers 10.1.1.1;\noption subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\noption broadcast-address 10.1.1.254;\noption domain-name-servers 10.1.1.2, 8.8.8.8;\n}\n\n#host temple {\n#hardware ethernet ‎BC:5F:F4:A2:29:96;\n#fixed-address 10.1.1.12;\n#}\n\nThe commented part when uncommented throws the error above.\n\nA: The should not be a colon after fixed-address.\nThis:\nhost temple {\nhardware ethernet ‎BC:5F:F4:A2:29:96;\nfixed-address: 10.1.1.12;\n}\n\nShould be this:\nhost temple {\nhardware ethernet ‎BC:5F:F4:A2:29:96;\nfixed-address 10.1.1.12;\n}\n\nEdit, based on the bigger context of the entire dhcpd.conf file:\nDo not allocate your fixed address from the dynamic address reserved pool.

So you can try\nscp /local/file/path root@192.168.1.xxx /media/more/path\n\nIf that does not work you would have to scp to somewhere in the home directory and then move it to the /media directory.

I am reading the book Ubuntu Server Book 2nd Edition. It states the following:\n\nAt the moment, Upstart does replace the functionality of init and the\n  /etc/inittab file and manages changes to run- levels, system start-up\n  and shutdown, console ttys, and more and more core functionality is\n  being ported to Upstart scripts\n\nMy take from this is that upstart handles starting up scripts on run-levels. So if run-level 2 was entered, it will be Upstart and not System V that starts the script, which in turn starts the executable program.\nSo I have installed postgresql from the repositories. And indeed when system starts up, the postgres daemon runs in the background. Obviously if System V didn't do this, then it must have been Upstart that performed this task. But when I go to /etc/init, which is where all the upstart scripts reside, there is no reference to postgresql anywhere. However, when I go to /etc/rc1.d, which is where run-level 1 scripts reside, I indeed find a postgresql script:\n$ ls -l | grep postgresql\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  20 Jun  1 11:10 K21postgresql -> ../init.d/postgresql\n\nSo why is there no upstart script for postgresql and without an upstart script, how is postgresql starting up?\n\nA: Yes on version 14; no on version 15.\nOn Ubuntu Linux version 14: yes, upstart truly is handling all of this.  You need to read the part of the Cookbook that discusses how it handles programs that come only with old System 5 rc scripts, and the manual page for upstart \"runlevel\" events.  There's a whole mechanism for invoking the old System 5 rc program.  It's just another job as far as upstart proper is concerned.\nOn Ubuntu Linux version 15; no, upstart is not involved any more.  systemd is handling all of this.  systemd has mechanisms for old System 5 rc scripts.  However, the /etc/init.d/postgresql file that you are looking at is irrelevant on version 15.  PostgreSQL comes with two systemd service unit files in version 15, /lib/systemd/system/postgresql@.service and /lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service.

Such commands have the ability to control power as well as send SMS, connect to internet via LTE,GPRS or 3G and even reset the devices and take calls. I also must mention that the only way to control such devices is via \"AT\" commands.\n\"AT\" command standard have have about 10 - 15 universal commands and some devices have an added set of commands to allow connections to the internet. Below are few of such actions possible,\n\n\n*\n\n*Making a connection to SSL or non SSL servers.\n\n*Sending data to a port in the server once the connection is active.\n\n*closing connections.\n\n\nI believe (correct me if I am wrong) that one AT command corresponds to one of the above tasks. \nI am interested in writing a driver in C for GNU/linux system  which can interpret and serve PCs internet needs via AT commands. This software must let the PC \"see\" it self as a \"way out\" perhaps like an ethernet connection. This is what most dongle softwares do.  They have usually two COM ports running at high speed. One COM port is controlled by the USB dongles default software and the other is used to send/receive data. \nI would appreciate if someone can explain me how I can develop a \"fake\" ethernet connection or make the PC \"see\" a way out using this driver software. The driver software will need to \"drive\" the GSM IC or a USB dongle to send/receive data. This project for educational purposes therefore, I am not interested in installing a binary software and getting my dongle to work.\nI would also so much appreciate if someone can relate to an open source project similar to this.\n\nA: hardware side: talking to GSM hardware\nThere seem to be several people using a \"SIM900 GPRS module\" to connect to web servers using AT commands.\nIs this close enough to what you are looking for?\n\n\n*\n\n*\"FTP HTTP AT Commands User Guide\"\n\n*\"SIM900GSM Arduino library\"\n\n*\"Arduino Forum: POST HTTP with AT Commands\"\n\n*\"POST HTTP command to update data into web server using GPRS\"\n\n*\"Sim900 AT commands + HTTP Get Request.\"\n\n*\"AT command for HTTP functions\"\nEDIT:\napplication side: talking to normal, unmodified Linux applications\nIt sounds like you want software like Firefox on your Linux computer to work normally, without any changes to the Firefox application itself, \"as if\" the PC is plugged into a standard Ethernet cable to the Internet.\nSo your software needs to be a device driver that \"looks like\" other Ethernet or WiFi device drivers on the application side, but on the hardware side routes data through a USB or other serial port to the GSM/GPRS hardware.\nCould you fork some standard Ethernet device driver or Wifi device driver, and then replace the section that talks to its specific Ethernet card hardware, with a section that talks to your specific GSM/GPRS hardware?\nEntire books could be and have been written on writing Linux device drivers;\nand many Linux device drivers are open source software:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alessandro Rubini & Jonathan Corbet.

I have locked my Putty application to the sidebar so that when I click on it, it launches Putty. So lets say I then use it to ssh to a router, it will then launch a shell to that router. Now let's say I want to use Putty to ssh to another router. I try and click/use another instance of Putty using the sidebar GUI button of Putty, but nothing happens. I believe it's because it thinks the application is open in another window. But when I used Windows 7, I would just right click the application and click launch putty, which would bring up another instance of putty I could use to connect to another router. How can I mimic this same functionality in Ubuntu from the sidebar GUI button?  Currently, I have to open up a new terminal & launch Putty from there in order to get another instance open, which makes my windows very clunky if I need to open 10 or 20 sessions to various network devices seen as I need 1 window to execute putty, and another window when putty ssh's to a network device.

For doing the same job as update-manager does, you have to run apt-get upgrade i personally prefer apt-get dist-upgrade because it also installs kernel upgrades etc. Probably update-manager acts more like dist-upgrade. man apt-get is a good help page...\nNow to the answers of your questions:\n1. how can a computer update itself without authorization?\nupdate-manager (the gui tool). Works only as a front-end. In the background there is aptd which is triggered by systemd. If you want to run updates, update-manager tells aptd over systemd to run the updates, while aptd is running as root.\nThe permission check itself is technically not necessary: While starting update-manager, it also asks aptd via systemd for which you won't be asked for a password.\nFor the auto updates, you should have a look at the script /etc/cron.daily/apt which runs as root once per day.\nThe process list while updates get installed shows something like this:\n14537 ?

Shortly after I've returned to Ubuntu (lubuntu 15.04) and the Cintiq worked out of the box for a few days.

A user filed a bug report about it (Launchpad Bug #1033598) in August 2012. Unfortunately, the bug has a low \"heat score\" and therefore does not attract much attention. The heat score would increase if more users confirmed that they were affected by the bug. There is a Catch-22, however, because you have to log in to Launchpad in order to confirm a bug, and Launchpad uses the Ubuntu One login, and setting up an Ubuntu One login is the very problem at issue....\nYou can work around this issue by registering on the main Ubuntu One login page, which does not require a Captcha. The procedure is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the main Ubuntu One login page (https://login.ubuntu.com/).\n\n*Click “I am a new Ubuntu One user.”\n\n*Enter your email address.\n\n*Enter your name.\n\n*Enter your password (twice).\n\n*Click the checkbox to accept the Ubuntu One terms of service.\n\n*Click “Create Account.”\n\n\nI would recommend that, as soon as you have registered with Ubuntu One, you visit Launchpad Bug #1033598 (link above) and confirm the bug to raise its heat level. Doing so would help attract attention to the bug and, one would hope, get it resolved for future users.

(If you are familiar with Chrome Extensions or Firefox Addons, GNOME Shell extensions are similar to them.) You can find and install GNOME Shell extensions using this website.\nI'm using GNOME 3. Why can't I install extensions?\nSome distributions don't quite package GNOME correctly. Make sure that you have the unzip package installed.\n\nArch Linux Wiki\n\nThe catalogue of extensions is available at extensions.gnome.org. By a user they can be installed and activated in the browser by setting the switch in the top left of the screen to ON and clicking Install on the resulting dialog (if the extension in question is not installed). After installation it is shown in the extensions.gnome.org/local/ tab, which has to be visited as well to check for available updates. Installed extensions can also be enabled or disabled using gnome-tweak-tool.\nInstalling extensions via a package makes them available for all users of the system and automates the update process.\n\nSo they should work for you.

Got a mail from google stating that that \"after May 29, 2015, OAuth 1.0 will no longer be supported and Google Earth versions 7.1.4 or earlier will not be able to authenticate to GME.\" But no update for Ubuntu is available and  the version 7.1.5 is only available for Windows and Mac. So how to install version 7.1.5 in Ubuntu?\n**EDIT: google earth for linux has updated finally.  \nGoogle Earth 7.1.5 can also be installed in Ubuntu using Wine**\n\nA: The little return (or even the complete lack of it) does not seem to be the reason for no longer supporting Linux after so many years.\nI rather suspect that the NSA requested its backdoors, and it was difficult to implement in Linux.\nSad but true, we will have to find alternatives to Google.\n", "Q: What is an object path? This man page has the following section:\nudisksctl unmount {--object-path OBJECT | --block-device DEVICE}\n\nWhat is an OBJECT? I tried to give it a path (i.e. media/tim/name) but it doesn't accept that.\nWhat do I need to tell it?\n\nA: UDisks2 uses D-Bus \"objects\". These are essentially paths to data structures. \nHere's how the manual puts it:\n\nThe process that owns the well-known D-Bus name org.freedesktop.UDisks2 on the system bus (typically udisksd) exports an object at the well-known path /org/freedesktop/UDisks2.  This object implements the org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager interface and should be used by clients to discover other objects.\n\n", "Q: How is Ubuntu's terminal different from Windows' cmd.exe? Does Ubuntu's standard terminal have the same functions as Windows' cmd.exe, or does it do different tasks?\nBy that,  I mean e.g. whether I can move files or unmount USB devices in both? I know they have different syntaxes.\nWould you open Ubuntu's terminal for the same things you would open cmd.exe on Windows or are there common different use cases?\n\nA: cmd and terminal are similar in giving a user a text based interface (obviously) and access to certain lower-level utilities for troubleshooting or configuring the systems. \nFor instance, in my university  every time a computer does not seem to allow a user to log in, what does the admin do? Open cmd , and ping the host. That would be the same with terminal. \nHow would you kill a process that is taking too much memory? In terminal pkill firefox , and in cmd taskkill firefox.exe. \nThe shell scripting on linux is similar to batch scripting on windows. Here's grep equivalent on windows. There used to be a command-line text editor running under cmd.exe , called edit but it has been discontinued since windows 7 64 bit version.\nSo in that respect , yes, you would open cmd and terminal for the same purposes. \nThe difference however, is that the linux terminal can take on many more tasks, and it's much more flexible. Even moderate level users can do some simple things in terminal whereas cmd.exe on Windows is more of an admin exclusivity...\n\nA: cmd.exe is a shell. Bash is a shell. They both interpret and run command-line input in similar (ish) ways, both allow you to run things, and both can interpret scripts based on their relative syntaxes, but those syntaxes is fairly different.\nPowerShell is another terminal interpreter from Microsoft. It's a lot more like Bash in terms of native capability albeit with an even wilder syntax.\nIn general, Windows' emphasis has been on providing graphical access to things. A lot of functionality isn't natively exposed by command line commands. What is has was mostly copied over from MSDOS so everyday things like moving files around is simple enough, but unmounting can take extra applications. I suspect you can do anything with enough searching and installing.\nIn other words, if I found primed nuclear device and the only interface to diffuse it was a cmd.exe command line, we'd probably all die. I'd take my chances with tar.\n", "Q: screen is not locked after suspend/lid closed My screen doesn't get locked after I close my laptop lid. The laptop suspends but the screen is not locked.\nI checked multiple settings:\ngnome-control-center > brightness & lock > lock on and require password when waking from suspend enabled\ndconf-editor > org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-lock-screen disabled\ndconf-editor > org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-enabled enabled\ndconf-editor > org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/ubuntu-lock-on-suspend enabled\n\nBut can't get to lock my screen after suspend. What else can I try? \n\nA: Not a solution, but you may use this script as a workaround:\n#!/bin/bash\nqdbus com.canonical.Unity /com/canonical/Unity/Session com.canonical.Unity.Session.Lock &&\nqdbus com.canonical.Unity  /com/canonical/Unity/Session com.canonical.Unity.Session.Suspend\n\nThis works with stock Ubuntu with Unity desktop. The approach is specific to Unity, although there are dbus calls to suspend regardless of the desktop environment. For 16.04 , one could use systemctl suspend command. See the relevant post: https://askubuntu.com/a/1795/295286\nAlternative (older answer, edited)\nOne of the other tools for suspending, that works regardless of the Ubuntu version is pm-suspend. Problem is that it requires root privilege. To work around that, add pm-suspend to /etc/sudoers file to be executed without password ( more info here ). \nIn particular, in my /etc/sudoers I have the following:\n# Allow using pm-suspend for my user without password\nserg ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend\n\nThus, you can use:\nsh -c 'gnome-screensaver-command -l && sudo pm-suspend'\n\nThe sudo pm-suspend won't prompt you for password then.\n\nA: I was facing similar issue this answer solved my issue. Install Unity Tweak Tool and in System > Security all the options should be unticked. The Desktop Lock was ticked in my case uncheck this.\n\nIf the above mentioned option is ticked then in System Settings > Brightness and Lock the lock option is disabled which causes all the problem.\n\n", "Q: SSH denied after messing with fstab Goal: repartition one big 5TB /home partion into separate partitions on a remote Ubuntu server.  \nApproach: I took a backup of /home, then erased the partition in gparted and created new partitions, including /home and /home/username (/home for 2-3 users and a special partition for my own user).\nI then mounted the partitions from the terminal and copied the home backup back into /home, and edited the fstab file, which I suspect went wrong as it is the first time I play around with partitions in Linux. I then did a reboot.\nIssue: I now get connection refused when I try to ssh or when trying to access FTP.  \nQuestion: Is there a way to fix this without reinstalling? I have no files but i will have to contact the hosting company to perform a reinstall, so I'd prefer to fix it without having to do that.\n\nA: I am equally looking for an answer to this as SSH / FTP is not functional after editing fstab which was on an SD card. What I needed to do to get SSH / FTP login to work was:\n\n\n*\n\n*I copied an image of Ubuntu 18.04 to a thumb drive and used that to boot my \"Windows\" laptop into Ubuntu using the thumb drive.\n\n*Press Esc at boot time to select start-up options.\n\n*Once in Ubuntu I put the SD card into an \"ANKER\" brand multi-card reader to USB and accessed the SD card through \"rootfs\".\n\n*Once I was at the /etc/fstab file, I used\nsudo nano fstab\n\nto comment out the line I previously entered that corrupted SSH / FTP login. I saved the edit (Ctrl+x, yes, enter) and rebooted my original machine and have access to SSH / FTP.\nSo to me, that means fstab is a culprit if it is not edited correctly.\n\nA: I have a very similar situation here... Virtual machine, setup with two ssh accessible accounts and a webserver.  Added a 1TB drive to the machine, had to reboot to see the drive, sshed in to get it setup, mounted as /dev/sdc1 at /mnt/sdc1, formatted ext4, everything was working - logged out and back in via ssh as both users several times, then edited the fstab to add it to the bottom of the list:\n/dev/sdc1 /mnt/sdc1 ext4 rw 0 2\ndid another reboot and I couldn't get in via ssh anymore: Connection refused.  both accounts.  Waited for a long while thinking maybe it was fsck ing the new 1TB but, there weren't any files on it yet.  Finally pinged it, and it's responding, website is all there and the wiki on the website accepts new edits, but... still Connection refused on port 22 when trying to ssh in as any user.  Predictably: scp also refuses connection.\nI can, eventually, get into the VM controls and start the VM from a boot disk then mount the sda1 partition and put /etc/fstab back where it came from, but... why am I here?

I just want to use it to see whether it is as good a Windows 7.\nMy config is AMD FX 6300 3.5 GHz,8GB RAM,AMD R9 270X and a 970 chipset motherboard.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is a Long Term Support release, meaning you will be able to run it until 2019 and still get system updates. This release is typically considered the more stable.\nUbuntu 15.04 is only supported until January 2016. This means that you will have to do a full system upgrade at that time. This release offers some more up-to-date packages, and may have better support for bleeding edge hardware.\nMy recommendation would be to try Ubuntu 14.04 with the live CD/USB and make sure everything works as you expect (hardware wise). If it does, then 14.04 is the better choice. If you find any hardware related problems, you could try Ubuntu 15.04. \nFrom an end-users perspective, there is no real difference between 14.04 and 15.04.\n\nA: I would advise 14.04\nWhy? Your specs are good enough to support either fine, but you said you have no past experience.\n14.04 is an LTS release - or Long Term Support. This means that for 5 years - or until April 2019 - Ubuntu will continue to provide security updates, among others.\n15.04 is a regular release. This is only supported to January 2016.\nFor your needs, I think 14.04 is most suitable.\n\nA: The difference is basically that 14.04 has a longer support period than 15.04 (April 2019 and January 2016 respectively). 14.04 would be a better choice if you are aiming on installing the system and not reformatting for a long period, for example on a server or with the more conservative desktop users.\nOn the other hand, if you are looking for slightly more modern software, or are just trying out the system, 15.04 would be a better choice. \nIf you download both LiveCDs, you can test them both without installing on your hardware, and see which works out better for your own uses.\n\nA: Your hardware is enough to run a Linux OS.\nThe difference between LTS and no-LTS is easy to get if you google it. Here is my advice:\nIf you want to run a stable OS, like do some important things, you should use LTS. And if you want to try new features, you'd like newer version more. And for your purpose I think you don't need to worry about the difference at all. Just try one and you'll find there's so much difference between Ubuntu & Windows. Enjoy!\n\nA: Ubuntu 15.04 is good.  So far, I have no issue with it.   I had installed it to desktops and laptops and had no issue with it.  I also made dual boot with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 15.04.

I'd like to know how to delete my Windows 7 OS using ubuntu\n\nA: Hi and welcome to askubuntu,\nI assume that you have a ubuntu live cd or usb in hand. The simplest and safest way would be to use OS-Uninstaller, a easy to use GUI tool which helps you uninstall any Operating System installed on your system with one click.But, please note that, you should install OS-Uninstaller on ubuntu live.\nTo install this tool, open up your terminal(Ctrl + Alt + T) on ubuntu live and type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\n\nPress Enter and type :\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -y os-uninstaller && os-uninstaller\n\nPress Enter once again and OS-Uninsaller will be installed on your system.\nNow open OS-Uninstaller(onen the dash and type OS-Uninstaller).\nYou will now see a window showing all Operating Systems installed on your system. Choose the one you want to remove (Windows 7 in your case) and click \"OK\". A confirmation window will appear, click \"Apply\" on that.\nYou can find the detailed documentation of OS-Uninstaller here : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OS-Uninstaller\nHope it helps!\n\nA: *\n\n*Graphical with \"gparted\". You can install it from Ubuntu software center. You can ONLY edit partitions that are not active (Windows from Ubuntu will not be so you are OK there). Otherwise create a bootable gParted DVD (always handy when you have one around)\n\n*From command line you can do this with the command \"parted\". \n", "Q: How to change file permissions and then revert them back I have a Wordpress website on my Ubuntu Server, and in order to change the theme, I need to set the file permissions.

Is this ok for security? Will the files be accessible only by me?  \n\nA: *\n\n*files should be \"644\", directories should be \"755\". What you want is not permissions but you want to set the files and directories to a user and group that is allowed to write files into /var/www/html/.\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/html/*\n\nwould set all to your current user or if you need something like \"www-data\" (the default apache user) change it to that.

Help? Okay first of all I have done my homework and research on this. Most of the guides that I have found are for setting up MSMTP with Gmail. First let me tell you what I have done so far.\nMy box is running Ubuntu 12.04. I'm using Zpanel 10.1.1. Since I don't need to to receive emails on my server, I have no need for Postfix which is bundled with the software. So I disabled it at startup using:\n sudo update-rc.d postfix disable\n\nBefore I go any further, the scenario is this. I run multiple websites on this box. They're all Wordpress sites. One of those sites has users sign up but I need it to send confirmation emails. When people receive the emails I need to it say its from \"wordpress@mydomain1.com\". Then if another website needs to send out an email, I need the email to be received from that websites domain: \"wordpress@mydomain2.com\". Make sense? \nSo after I disabled Postfix I installed MSMTP using the command \nsudo apt-get install msmtp ca-certificates\n\nThen I made the config file using the the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/msmtprc\n\nThen inside the config file is the following: (Username and Password has been changed)\ntls on\ntls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\ntls_starttls off\n\naccount default\nhost smtpout.asia.secureserver.net\nuser (my GoDaddy email address)\nfrom (my GoDaddy email address)\npassword (my GoDaddy password)\nport 25\n\nThen in the guide I was following it said I had to run the following command:\nsudo chmod 0644 /etc/msmtprc\n\nThen I went into my php.ini file and changed the sendmail path with the following commands:\nnano /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n\nThen in the php.ini I changed the sendmail path to this:\nsendmail_path = \"/usr/bin/msmtp -t\"\n\nThen I did a test with MSMTP from the command line:\n echo -e \"Subject: Test Mail\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a test mail\" |msmtp --debug --from=(GoDaddyEmail) -t (PersonalGmailEmail)\n\nWith that command it shows me what the server is doing and it shows me any errors that happen:\nloaded system configuration file /etc/msmtprc\nignoring user configuration file /root/.msmtprc: No such file or directory\nfalling back to default account\nusing account default from /etc/msmtprc\nhost                  = smtpout.asia.secureserver.net\nport                  = 25\ntimeout               = off\nprotocol              = smtp\ndomain                = localhost\nauth                  = choose\nuser                  = (GoDaddyEmail)\npassword              = *\npasswordeval          = (not set)\nntlmdomain            = (not set)\ntls                   = on  \ntls_starttls          = off\ntls_trust_file        = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\ntls_crl_file          = (not set)\ntls_fingerprint       = (not set)\ntls_key_file          = (not set)\ntls_cert_file         = (not set)\ntls_certcheck         = on\ntls_force_sslv3       = off\ntls_min_dh_prime_bits = (not set)\ntls_priorities        = (not set)\nauto_from             = off\nmaildomain            = (not set)\nfrom                  = (GoDaddyEmail)\ndsn_notify            = (not set)\ndsn_return            = (not set)\nkeepbcc               = off\nlogfile               = /root/msmtp.log\nsyslog                = (not set)\naliases               = (not set)\nreading recipients from the command line and the mail\nmsmtp: TLS handshake failed: An unexpected TLS packet was received.\nmsmtp: could not send mail (account default from /etc/msmtprc)\n\nBut none of that is working..

Any advice on where to begin?\n\n\n\n marc@Thor:~$ blkid\n /dev/sda1: UUID=\"1bd1fc27-31da-4515-b1b1-2d4acea80abe\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n /dev/sda5: UUID=\"e54014fa-3d67-42c0-9532-b5b5efc35e5b\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n marc@Thor:~$\n\n\n marc@Thor:~$ cat /proc/partitions\n major minor  #blocks  name\n\n    8        0  312571224 sda\n    8        1  308659200 sda1\n    8        2          1 sda2\n    8        5    3909632 sda5\n   11        0    1048575 sr0\n marc@Thor:~$\n\n\n marc@Thor:~$ sudo blkid -p /dev/sda2\n [sudo] password for marc: \n /dev/sda2: PTTYPE=\"dos\" PART_ENTRY_SCHEME=\"dos\" PART_ENTRY_TYPE=\"0x5\" PART_ENTRY_NUMBER=\"2\" PART_ENTRY_OFFSET=\"617322494\" PART_ENTRY_SIZE=\"7819266\" PART_ENTRY_DISK=\"8:0\" \n marc@Thor:~$`\n\n\nA: My guess is that you had a Debian image on your hard disk (either in a file or written \"raw\" to a partition) and that it just happens to have been stored where your /dev/sda2 now begins. Because /dev/sda2 is basically just a placeholder for your /dev/sda5, which is swap space, it could be that enough of the original disc image remains on the disk to confuse the auto-mounter.\nIf I'm right, the fix is to overwrite whatever data the auto-mounter is seeing that's making it think the Debian image is on /dev/sda2. The trouble with this solution is that anything you might do is potentially risky; you might accidentally trash some or all of your data. Thus, if you intend to follow my suggestions, you must do so at your own risk, and I STRONGLY advise you to back up your important user data first!\nThose caveats out of the way, the simplest and easiest thing to do is to ensure that /dev/sda2's first sector is clear of unnecessary data:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 bs=440 count=1\n\nType this command exactly as shown here. A mistake with any of the options could result in serious data loss. After you type this command, reboot and see if things have improved. If they haven't, you could try a longer and riskier procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a Terminal window, type sudo swapoff to disable your use of swap space.\n\n*Using GParted, parted, or fdisk, delete /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda2.\n\n*Create a new /dev/sda2, but make it a regular primary partition, not an extended partition. If you use fdisk, give it a type code of 0x82 (Linux swap). If you use parted, give it a \"file system type\" of linux-swap.\n\n*Reboot. This ensures that you'll be using the new partition table.\n\n*Type sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2. Be extra extra super careful with this command. Pay particular attention to the of= value -- it should be /dev/sda2, not /dev/sda or any other value. The point of this command is to completely erase the disk space occupied by /dev/sda2. If you accidentally specify the wrong target, you'll wipe out whatever it holds.\n\n*Create new swap space on /dev/sda2.\n\n*\n\n*If you used fdisk or parted for partitioning, type sudo mkswap /dev/sda2. Again, be very careful with the disk device.\n\n*If you used GParted for partitioning, it's easiest to go back in to GParted to set /dev/sda2 up as swap space.\n\n\n*Type sudo blkid /dev/sda2. This will show you the UUID value associated with the swap space.\n\n*Edit /etc/fstab and change the UUID value associated with swap from the old value to the new one.\n\n*Reboot and test. The problem should be gone.\n\n\nAs you can see by all the caveats and warnings, this procedure is far from risk-free. I recommend you try it only if you're already familiar with low-level tools like dd and fdisk.\nIt's conceivable that a tiny resize operation on your partition will clear up the problem; for instance, you could shrink /dev/sda1 by 1MiB and resize /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda5 to fill that space. I can't promise this would work, though; it's conceivable that the move/resize will move the errant disc image data along with everything else.\n\nA: My solution ended up to be creating a new partition table as part of a re-install. I nuked it from orbit.\n", "Q: Ibus anthy/mozc works in every program except for Chrome I've installed both anthy and mozc in order to type Japanese characters on my system, and it works for the most part: Both work in Skype, LibreOffice, the Terminal, and everything else I have tried EXCEPT for Chrome, even Firefox. When I switch my input method to either it should type in Japanese in Chrome but instead it only types roman characters. If necessary I can type in a word-processor and copy and paste the Japanese text into Chrome but this is both annoying and impractical, and I don't actually like Firefox.\nI have found lots of people with the same problem by googling it, and know that the same or a similar issue was asked on this website too, but in none of those places where it was mentioned was anyone able to provide a solution.\n\nA: I found your question after Mozc mysteriously stopped working in Chrome in Mint XFCE 17.2. Funnily enough, I had just been using it earlier in the morning to type Japanese within Chrome.\nThe only thing that changed was that I'd installed the ibus-gtk3 package while trying to troubleshoot the fact that Mozc's suggestion box would appear at the bottom of the Chrome window whenever I was typing.\nAs luck would have it, uninstalling ibus-gtk3 solved the issue:\nsudo apt-get remove ibus-gtk3\n\nOnce you log out and then log back in, Mozc should start working again in Chrome, though if your system is like mine then the popup appears in the bottom-left corner of the window instead of just under the cursor:\n\nAnyway, as you can see in the picture this re-enabled Mozc functionality within Chrome.\nEDIT: I poked around a bit more and managed to re-fix this issue by opening up Mint's Language Settings, going to Input Method, and then clicking Install Missing Components next to the IBus option.\nThis added the following four packages:\nibus-clutter\nibus-gtk\nibus-gtk3\nibus-qt4\n\nAfter restarting mdm:\nsudo restart mdm\n\nIBus came back up without issue, and I confirmed that Mozc works fine in Chrome. It even fixed the placement of the pop-up window that I was complaining about earlier!\nPlease keep in mind that I'm testing all of this out in Mint 17.2. I know this is askubuntu.com, but since the two are so similar hopefully there's enough info here to help you figure this out.\n", "Q: Abiword opens a blank template on startup after upgrade A quick and annoying problem has come my way.\nAfter I upgraded my Ubuntu from 14.10 to 15.04 I get a blank Abiword template/Abi document opened on login.\nThis open Abiword doc also applies to my other id's as well on my box when logged into.\nAny idea how to stop this from happening?\nI have verified that Abiword is not in my start-up list.\nThanks\nCheers\n\nA: It is a bug related to an Abiword collaboration plugin in telepathy (empathy).

The alternative add-ons for Firefox Quantum may be found in other answers.\n\nThe easiest way is probably to use the extension: SmoothWheel\nThe extension is no longer found on Mozilla Add-ons site but still available via home page at mozdev.org, which likely for Firefox 56 or older version only. This extension gives extended options to customize your scrolling experience, by controlling the step size and speed of scrolling. Have a look at screenshot below.\n\nThe default setting is somewhat smoother than before installing the Add-ons, but likely too fast for what you want. Try the following suggestion (tried by myself).\nScroll settings\nUnder Basic - Scroll, change accordingly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Step Size: 1/5 page --> 5 pixels\n\n*Speed: Normal (0.4 sec) --> Relaxed (0.7 sec)\nThen, click Apply button to make changes effective. At this point, you may notice that the page \"accelerates\" depending on your scrolling gesture habit. For more consistent feel, continue with following steps.\nUnder Advanced - Advanced Scroll Settings, change accordingly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adaptive-Duration: Medium (x2.5) --> [DISABLED]\nFinally, click Apply button again. Now you will notice that the scrolling is more \"even\" and consistent at each steps.\nScroll experience\nIf you experience occasional short hangs, you might want to visit this page that explains about VSync and other issues.\n\nUp to now I could not find a way to scroll exactly one line with firefox. \n\nWhile this solution may not give you exactly one line in Firefox, 5 pixels is the smallest step (followed by 1/20 page) you could get with this Add-ons. And perhaps less risky than tweaking in about:config.\nFrom my testing experience scrolling on this Mozilla Contribute page (2015), 1/20 page feels like something between 20 pixels and 50 pixels. That being said, 1/20 page might scroll more or less, depending on page contents and font size.\n\nA: You can use Yet Another Smooth Scrolling extension for Firefox:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/yet-another-smooth-scrolling/?src=api\nThen it is pretty easy to customize scroll options for both keyboard and mousewheel.\nGo to the extensions' preferences and choose a stepsize of keyboard or mouse depending on the font of your browser. (For me 22 worked well, with my font Georgia,size 15).\n\n\nA: Go to Preferences and then under the Advanced sub-menu uncheck Use smooth scrolling.\n\nThis should let you scroll more precisely, you just need to scroll very slowly.\n\nA: Reading @PeterNerlich comment, I decided to make an extension to detect the font size and scroll by that number of pixels. I primarily use chrome and made the extension for chrome.\nYou may download the beta version from this link.\nI've tested it in Windows version of chrome and Chromium Browser in Ubuntu 14.4.3. To include the gap between lines, I've multiplied the font size by 1.5. But, I'll provide a way to reduce or increase the gap factor in the next version. You may access Chrome Console(Ctrl+Shift+J ) to see the font size and read scroll data.\nTo install the extension, go to chrome://extensions/, drag and drop the beta file into the window. After that press the Add button.\n\nWorking of the extension: \n\n\n*\n\n*See this IMAGE\n\n*Browse to the web page and press the extension icon.\n\n*Press \"Detect Font Size!\" button.\n\n*Immediately after you press the button, click on the text you wish to scroll line by line.\n\n\nThe window will now scroll according to the font-size.\n\nI've also implemented code to bind the up and down keys in the keyboard just like the mouse wheel. I'll improve the functionality and release the next version shortly.\n\nA: Uncheck Always use cursor keys to navigate within pages.

I thought it would be nice if I could use this HDD whenever I wanted. Just plug it in and choose ubuntu in GRUB. So I followed these instructions.\nBut now I have this problem that when the external HDD is not connected, I get an error from GRUB. When I type 'exit', I can boot into Windows but this is not really practical. I just want the GRUB to show up when the HDD is connected, and boot into Windows otherwise.\nI already searched for a bit and didn't really find an answer to this specific problem. Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the instructions were for a self-installed copy of Windows 8, so their setup was NOT a UEFI machine.  Things are a little different for preinstalled Windows 8 on UEFI machines. \nExternal (removable) boot devices should have their own 300M, FAT, EFI partition to hold the bootloaders.  When you select the location for the bootloader (on sdb for the external), use this partition (which may work) instead of the device (which never works).  When it doesn't work, the internal hard disk is used, so just copy the files from the internal disk's EFI to the external disk's EFI.  Now, the installer still may not set up the bootloaders into the right directory for a removable device --  they should go into /EFI/Boot, and be named /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.  Instead, grubx64.efi and shimx64.efi (the bootloaders) typically get put into /EFI/ubuntu (just like on the internal hard disk).  I like to use shimx64.efi as the bootx64.efi file so the boot works whether secure boot is enabled or disabled.  So, copy /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi to /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi (note the name change), and also copy /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi to /EFI/Boot/grubx64.efi.  The grub.cfg file may be left in /EFI/ubuntu.  \nThe nvram boot entry for USB (disks...) should now boot the external disk -- no new entry in nvram should be needed.  If  you are getting grub without the external hard disk, looks like it got installed to the internal hard disk's EFI (no problem), and was put before the Windows bootloaders in boot order (problem). efibootmgr from Ubuntu will allow you to change the boot order, or delete the unwanted Ubuntu entry (remember, you will be booting with the USB entry).  \n\nA: Ubfan1's approach (putting an EFI System Partition, or ESP, on the external disk and putting a copy of GRUB there) should work. There are several potential stumbling blocks, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*The existing external disk may well use the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system, rather than the GUID Partition Table (GPT) that EFI favors. Although EFI usually works with MBR, that's not 100% certain. At the very least, it's a less well-tested option than GPT. Converting from MBR to GPT (via gdisk) can overcome this problem, if it becomes one.\n\n*An ESP must be created on the external disk. This will almost certainly require resizing at least one partition and creating a new one. This isn't all that big of a deal for experienced people, but it is at least a minor hassle.\n\n*Switching the boot between OSes will likely require use of the computer's built-in boot manager. These can be a bit awkward to activate -- they often require a keypress at system start time.\n\n*You'll need to get GRUB installed to the external hard disk. AFAIK, the GRUB setup scripts aren't designed for doing this, so you'll need to improvise. Ubfan1 has provided some useful end-point information, but getting from start to finish will take a lot more than that. GRUB isn't really the best choice for this sort of customized setup, either. Overall, I think this is the biggest potential problem with ubfan1's suggestion, since it requires going \"off-script\" from the usual GRUB setup, and GRUB is notoriously difficult to configure except via its configuration scripts.\n\n\nAn alternative is to put a Linux boot manager and/or boot loader on the existing ESP on the internal hard disk. This placement means that your preferred boot loader (GRUB or something else) can run every time the computer boots, so you won't need to deal with the machine's internal boot manager as often. You also won't need to repartition the external disk or convert it from MBR to GPT. Boot Repair might help automate the setup.\nOn the other hand, if GRUB's configuration file ends up on the external disk, it will fail to work at all if the external disk is removed. (It's possible to put GRUB's grub.cfg file and other necessary support files on the ESP rather than in Linux's /boot directory, but I don't recall the precise details of how to set this up.) Instead of using GRUB in this role, my own rEFInd boot manager might be a better choice. It can be tested from a USB flash drive or CD-R -- but the ready-made images for this don't support Secure Boot, so you'd need to disable that for testing. rEFInd should enable you to boot either Windows or (when the disk is plugged in) Ubuntu. Unless the GRUB setup goes easier than I'd expect, rEFInd should be easier to set up -- if rEFInd on USB flash drive or CD-R can boot your existing Ubuntu, just install the Debian package or PPA in Ubuntu and it should set itself up automatically to the ESP on the internal disk. (If the external disk also has an ESP, there's a chance that rEFInd would install there instead.)\n", "Q: How to view designated Ubuntu file partition after installing Ubuntu? I was finally able to get Ubuntu 15.04 to fully install and boot on my laptop. Then found that when I opened the file manager, there was only one of my two partitions (I have one for windows and one for Ubuntu) showing up on the sidebar, it is labeled \"169 GB Volume\". When I click it, it shows my windows files. \nBut, back when I was in the \"Try Ubuntu\" mode, it showed these windows files AND the Ubuntu files (like bin, boot, lib, etc.) under labels \"169 GB Volume\" and \"139 GB Volume\".\nHow do I get the Ubuntu-based file  to appear in the sidebar (either alone or alongside the windows volume)?\n\nA: Your Ubuntu partitions are mount at start. That's why they are not shown as separate \"disks\" in file manager.\nYou can see all these system files and directories if you click on \"Computer\" in your file manager.\nIn most cases you do not need to do anything with system files.\nAll your files are in your home folder.\n\nA: As far as viewing Ubuntu's root ( / ) directory (same as Windows' C:\\ folder) , Pilot6 has already gave you the correct solution: click on the \"Computer\" icon in file manager's left panel. Alternatively use CtrlL shortcut, which opens address bar, type in / , and hit Enter. File manager will jump right to the root directory.\nNow , as far as listing all existing partitions goes, Terminal (aka command line, same as cmd on Windows ) will be the way to go. You can use sudo parted -l , lsblk , sudo blkid, sudo fdisk -l, or sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda. IMHO, if your task is to list partitions, terminal is the best approach\n", "Q: How to set up Transcend StoreJet 25M3 1TB USB 3.0 external hard drive to backup an ext4 file system?

Any help is appreciated! /M\n\nA: I don't have ALL of your answers, but I know I have enough to save you considerable time, anguish, and probably money.\nFirst I must caution you that microsoft does not play well with other operating systems.  It is difficult enough to set up a dual boot these days when Windows is already on the drive, but if you try adding windows to a computer which already has Ubuntu on it, there is a high probability that windows will wipe the drive despite your best efforts.  Fortunately I have a relatively easy solution which could easily cost you under $50.\nTo ensure windows doesn't wipe your Ubuntu installation, REMOVE YOUR HARD DRIVE.  Replace the hard drive with a nice blank one, and install Windows on that.  Move your old hard drive into a well cooled external usb case and then you can boot that (or most other computers) to your rescued ubuntu installation.\nIf for any reason you are hesitant to remove the physical drive, such as a warranty for example I can advise you how to clone your ubuntu onto an external drive before you attempt installing windows.  Both solutions are equally valid.  I remove hard drives all the time, so that's the solution that occurs first to me.\nIf I recall correctly, Microsoft now offers the installable files as a free download, so you don't need to buy disks, and the files are up to date, rather like ubuntu distros.\n", "Q: How do I play RuneScape with minimal lagging? RuneScape is a Java-based MMORPG that on Ubuntu can only be accessed (or at least to my knowledge) via going to http://www.runescape.com/game.ws in a Java-supporting web browser (such as Firefox or Opera) with the required plugins. The problem is that in my experience RuneScape is very laggy when opened up in Firefox on 32 bit Ubuntu 15.04 (with 3.8 GB RAM with an Intel processor). I was just wondering if there was a way to improve the performance of RuneScape, on this platform (like accessing it in a different browser, for instance). I have previously tried using Wine to install the game client (which is designed for Microsoft Windows OSs) but it does not appear to work for me anymore, even though on previous versions of Ubuntu (I think it was 12.04) perhaps with previous game clients this method worked. \n\nA: You can play RuneScape locally without Wine using the RuneScape Unix Client (RSU Client). Installation instructions for all currently supported versions of Ubuntu:  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hikariknight/unix-runescape-client   \nsudo apt-get update   \nsudo apt-get install unix-runescape-client   \n\nYou can use different java versions by editing the \"preferredjava\" setting inside ~/.config/runescape/share/settings.conf\nalong with several other settings.  \nYour frame rate in game very much comes down to the hardware installed on your system. You can have limitations due to this. Some of the most important components on your computer for higher fps are your graphics card, total RAM and your CPU. The older or less powerful they are, the more likely you are to suffer from a poor frame rate.1 You can free up maybe half a gigabyte of RAM by installing a lightweight desktop environment that you can optionally select to login to instead of Unity.\n1View and improve your frame rate in RuneScape by Mod_Rambo at Jagex\n", "Q: How to make this GUI as only CLI? Recently I installed Ubuntu 15.04. It's really fantastic but I don't want to use the GUI. I want to practice commands.\nHow can I make Ubuntu CLI only?\n\nA: If you really want Ubuntu to be CLI only, install Ubuntu Server. It is possible to rip out the GUI but that might break your installation. Please backup your data before doing this: sudo apt-get autoremove --purge ubuntu-desktop.\nIf you want to learn commands without having a fairly unusable machine, consider running Ubuntu Server in a VM or even just opening a terminal with Ctrl+Shift+T.\nSome example pieces of software that run VMs on Ubuntu are:\n\n\n*\n\n*VirtualBox: install with sudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\n*VMM/KVM: install with sudo apt-get install virt-manager\n\nA: If you want to practice command-line scripting opening a terminal, as suggested, is one way to go about it.\nA second way, which will allow you to keep your DE, is to login to a text-only virtual console. It has kind of an old Unix server feel to it. There are 6 virtual consoles in Ubuntu accessed by the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Alt+F1 to Ctrl+Alt+F6. The console can be accessed at any time during your session, but preferably when the login manager presents itself (unity-greeter). \nIn the console type your user name (hit Enter) at the prompt and then your password at the next prompt. To exit the session, type exit (assuming you're still in your account and at shell-lvl 1) and you will be returned to the login prompt. Press the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F7 to return to the login manager screen or your desktop environment. \nYou can check what tty you are currently logged in on by typing the who command at the prompt, in the textual console.

The computer is an Acer Aspire E5-521-238Q.\nWhat do I do to stop the black screen?\n\nA: It would be difficult to say precisely as to what must have happened, but I can give you a few suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for some more time. It might be possible that some installation process is running in the background. \n\n*There might be an issue with the GRUB. In such a case you will have to do a fresh install. There might be a possibility that your windows has been irreparably damaged, and you may have to do a fresh install of windows.\n\n\nThe best thing that I would suggest for you is to use a virtual machine like VMWare from within windows. This gives you the added benefit of using Linux (on a virtual machine) alongside windows as your primary OS.\n", "Q: Can't erase everything (partition/data) on sdcard, even with dd I have a Kingston sdcard (16g) with partition and data written on it. here is the output of \nroot@victor-ss9:/home/victor# fdisk -l /dev/sdf\nDisk /dev/sdf: 15.6 GB, 15560867840 bytes\n4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 474880 cylinders, total 30392320 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x000cde21\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdf1            3072      266239      131584    6  FAT16\n/dev/sdf2          266240    30392319    15063040   83  Linux\n\nthen I erased with dd:\nroot@victor-ss9:/home/victor# sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdf bs=8192\ndd: error writing ‘/dev/sdf’: No space left on device\n1899521+0 records in\n1899520+0 records out\n15560867840 bytes (16 GB) copied, 557,952 s, 27,9 MB/s\n\nThen I fdisk again, and oh! surprise, NO CHANGE:\nroot@victor-ss9:/home/victor# fdisk -l /dev/sdf\nDisk /dev/sdf: 15.6 GB, 15560867840 bytes\n4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 474880 cylinders, total 30392320 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x000cde21\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdf1            3072      266239      131584    6  FAT16\n/dev/sdf2          266240    30392319    15063040   83  Linux\n\nfiles and partitions are still there! same for both card.

I know about netstat, ncat,tcpdump and some others tools that show all connections, but what tool should I use if I want to see a specific connection established with a specific server? \nFor example: I am connecting to www.google.com port 80 from a simple web client; I need a command which only shows my connection with \"www.google.com port 80\".\n\nA: You need to parse the output of netstat. On my system, netstat doesn't display the string \"Google\" when listing hosts. So, instead of simply using netstat -t | grep -i Google, you would need to lookup the name of the host. Something like:\n$ sudo netstat -tn | awk '/EST/{print $5}' | sed 's/:.*//' | \n    while read ip; do \n        whois $ip | grep -qi google && echo \"$ip\"; \n    done\n173.194.67.189\n74.125.140.105\n216.58.209.5\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo netstat -tn : run netstat showing only tcp connections (-t) and numerical IPs (-n);\n\n*awk '/EST/{print $5}' : print the 5th field (the IP) if this line matches EST (show only established connections);\n\n*sed 's/:.*//' : remove the port, leaving only the IP;\n\n*while read ip; do ...; done : iterate over each IP found;\n\n*whois $ip | grep -qi google : lookup the IP and search the output for google.

On 14.04 the whois utility doesnt come 'stock out of the box', so you will have to install via command line as well as build-essential to compile the class file into binary.\n:~$ sudo apt-get install build-essential -y\n\n:~$ sudo apt-get install whois -y  \n\nThe program also expects two other directories to be in existence, /usr/local/addressId and /var/log/addressid so you will have to create these:\n:~$ sudo mkdir -p -m0755 /usr/local/addressId\n\n:~$ sudo mkdir -p -m0755 /var/log/adressid\n\nCopy the program into gedit text editor, then compile the program as shown below:\n:~$ g++ -o adressid addressId.cpp\n\nNext move the program to /usr/bin (which is already in your $PATH) and use the new utility from command line as shown below\n:~$ sudo mv addressid /usr/bin/\n\n:~$ sudo addressid\n\nYou have to run the program as root, because the netstat utility requires\nroot privileges to display all of the systems tcp information.\n//*******************************************************************\n// This addressId.cpp class is created to input the output from   \n// the netstat -tanp command and create a shell script that will be         \n// executed performing the ip address (a dotted quad) look up on the   \n// whois server (with whois utility).  \n// author:GeoWade\n//*******************************************************************\n\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <list>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <locale>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int MAX_INDY = 300;\n\nint main()\n{\n\n    // create string variables\n    string line;\n    string holdWord = \"\";\n\n    // create a string array to hold the ip addresses\n    string holdArry[MAX_INDY];\n\n    // create string variables to be used as test vars in regexs\n    string theTcp = \"tcp\";\n    string firstLn = \"0.0.0.0\";\n    string theSix = \"tcp6\"; \n\n    // create list<string> container object to hold input strings\n    list<string> addressList;\n\n    // create integer variables\n    int index;\n    int cardex;\n    int count = 0;\n\n    // use the system function to execute the netstat command and the data\n    system(\"sudo netstat -tanp > /usr/local/addressId/Ntstat.txt\");\n\n    // create an ifstream object \n    ifstream inFile(\"/usr/local/addressId/Ntstat.txt\");\n\n    while ( getline( inFile, line ) ) {\n\n        if ( !line.compare(44,7,firstLn) == 0 ) {\n\n            if ( line.compare(0,3,theTcp) == 0 ) {\n\n                if ( !line.compare(0,4,theSix) == 0 ) {\n\n                    // find the index position of the line at which point it ends \n                    cardex = line.find('\\0');\n\n                    // store the substring of the line based on index positions\n                    string intermStr = line.substr(44,cardex);\n\n                    // locate the index position of the substring at which a colon\n                    // resides\n                    index = intermStr.find(\":\");\n\n                    // create a second substr out of the first substring.\n                    holdWord = intermStr.substr(0,index);\n                    addressList.push_back(holdWord);\n\n                }\n                // null the holdWord var and increment the count integer\n                holdWord = \"\";              \n                count++;\n\n            }\n\n        }       \n\n    }\n\n    inFile.close();\n    cout << \"The data has been inputted to the program!\" << endl;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n\n        string outStack = addressList.front();\n        addressList.pop_front();\n\n        holdWord = outStack;\n\n        holdArry[i] = holdWord;\n        holdWord = \"\";      \n\n    }\n\n    // create an ofstream object\n    ofstream outOne;    \n    outOne.open(\"/usr/local/addressId/myWhois.sh\");\n    outOne << \"#! /bin/bash\\n\\nMYWH=\\\"whois\\\"\\nUPD=\\\"updatedb\\\"\\n\"\n           << \"TDTD=\\\"date\\\"\\n\\n$TDTD >> \"\n           << \"/var/log/addressid/addressid.log\\n\" << endl;\n\n    for (int j = count-1; j >= 0; j--) {\n\n        string outHold = holdArry[j];\n        holdArry[j] = \"\";\n        holdWord = outHold;\n\n        outOne << \"$MYWH \" << holdWord << \" >> \"\n               << \"/var/log/addressid/addressid.log\" \n               << \"\\n\" << endl;\n        holdWord = \"\";      \n\n    }\n\n    outOne << \"$UPD\\n\\nexit\\n\" << endl;\n\n    outOne.close();\n\n    system(\"chmod +x /usr/local/addressId/myWhois.sh\");\n\n    system(\"/usr/local/addressId/myWhois.sh\");\n\n    // delete the previously created and executed my\n    system(\"rm -rf /usr/local/addressId/myWhois.sh\");\n\n    count = 0;\n    addressList.clear();\n\n    // output a statement to the user of the binary\n    cout << \"The operation has completed successfully!\" << endl;\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nI wrote this program about 3 years ago, back on 12.04 as part of a security and logging suite I created. None the less it will log every address and those addresses information when it is ran, it also adds the date to the log each time it is ran.

See the NTFS section in man mount.\n\nA: Essentially, NTFS is a Windows filesystem, which doesn't quite map directly to the traditional unix permissions. An artificial mapping is done by default (see ntfs-3g man page , Access Handling and Security):\n\nBy default, files and directories are owned by the effective  user  and\n         group  of  the  mounting  process,  and everybody has full read, write,\n         execution and directory browsing  permissions.   You  can  also  assign\n         permissions  to  a  single user by using the uid and/or the gid options\n         together with the umask, or fmask and dmask options.\n\n(This is quite similar to the way FAT filesystems are mounted too.)\nThere is fundamentally a problem of mapping Linux users to Windows users, which has direct consequences on the permission model (see User Mapping section of that man page). You also can use a more advanced configuration there (see permissions and acl options), but this will involve a finer grained access control model, closer to what you can do on Ext filesystems with ACLs enabled, which will not be visible by only looking at the traditional rwxrwxrwx model.\n(Note that the NTFS section in man mount doesn't apply to ntfs-3g, which you're using.)\n", "Q: Export and Import settings of Plasma5 Is there a way of exporting and importing Plasma5 settings like settings for the taskbar, dophlin, shortcuts and so on and import them for a new user or on a new installation?\n\nA: Configuration files are stored in ~/.config and ~/.kde/share (for KDE apps). If you want to get the configuration for a specific program, look for a file containing the program's name and ending in rc or .conf. Some examples are\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.config/dolphinrc\n\n*~/.kde/share/config/amarokrc\n\n*~/.config/kde.org/plasmashell.conf\nBe careful, though, as some programs may store their configurations in unexpected places. Some configurations also may not work if the new user has a different name from the old one (for example, one line in my amarokrc is 1=./home/andrew/Music - this would be different depending on the username) or if they are a different person than the old user (~/.config/emaildefaults stores the user's preferred email address).\nSome programs may even have several configuration files containing different data! Picmi, for example, uses ~/.config/picmirc to store high scores, and ~/.config/picmi/picmi.conf to store the previous window position.\nIf this is just to transfer a single user's settings to the new computer, you could likely get away without changing anything (I copied my entire user folder over when I switched computers, because I had the same username on both machines), but otherwise you'll need to be careful about what files you keep and what files you leave behind.\n", "Q: Error when running update: Unable to find expected entry 'restricted/source/Sources' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file) I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS through bootable USB.

You've only specified the port on the inside, i.e. in the docker container (8080). You haven't specified the port on the outside, i.e. the host. This means Docker will bind to some random port on the outside. You can find out what port that is by running docker ps. Then you'll see something like \n0.0.0.0:32769->8080/tcp \n\nwhich indicates that if you visited port 32769 in your browser you might get through to Apache because Docker has bound port 32769 on the host to port 8080 inside the container.\nWhat you actually want to do is this: -p 8080:8080 to make sure that the port is the same on the host and in the container.\n\n*Secondly it's not at all clear to me whether you've installed apache2 in the container or on the host. Normally you would write a Dockerfile based on the ubuntu image you want to use which specifies apache should be installed when the Docker image is built. This all happens before you run the container. You should avoid installing anything in a Docker container after you've run it, because it will be lost once you delete that instance of the container.\n", "Q: Intel AC7260 wifi card disconnects and have to restart I have a Dell XPS 9333 with Ubuntu 15.04 and Intel wifi card (ac7260).

Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds.

Simple yet effective app  which enables you to control volume from the whole taskbar (panel) not just from indicator icon. Especially if you use wireless mouse you'll appreciate how practical it is. Since there is no similar solution for Ubuntu it would be nice to have a script that covers it. \n\nA: Modern mouse devices have more than one id when you run query xinput list. This script will cover those devices as well but first proper id must be determined. The selection is based on difference between outputs of xinput query-state <id> command and assumption that one id will have some key 245 in output, hence the line:\nmoid0=$(xinput query-state $moid1 | grep 245)\n\nFor your device the difference between outputs may vary, but you can use another keyword not 245 and change the line.\nSo the script look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nvctrl1 () { \n    xinput test $mo | while read line\n    do\n        eval $(xdotool getmouselocation --shell)\n        if [ $Y -gt 24 ]; then break\n        elif [ \"$wnn\" != \"Desktop\" ] && [ $sd3 == $wg2 ]; then break\n        elif [[ $line == \"button release 5\" ]] ; then\n            xdotool key XF86AudioLowerVolume\n        elif [[ $line == \"button release 4\" ]] ; then\n            xdotool key XF86AudioRaiseVolume \n        fi\n    done\n}\n\nsd1=$(xdpyinfo | grep dimensions)\nsd2=\"${sd1#*dimensions:  }\"\nsd3=\"${sd2%% pixels*}\"\n\n\nwhile :\ndo\n    moid=$(xinput list | grep -iPo 'mouse.*id=\\K\\d+')\n\n    eval $(xdotool getmouselocation --shell)\n    if [[ $Y -le 24 && ! -z $moid ]]; then\n\n        wg1=$(xdotool getactivewindow getwindowgeometry)\n        wg2=\"${wg1#*Geometry: }\"\n\n        wnn=$(xdotool getactivewindow getwindowname)\n\n        read moid1 moid2 < <(echo $moid)\n        moid0=$(xinput query-state $moid1 | grep 245)\n        if [[ ! -z $moid0 ]]; then mo=$moid2 && vctrl1\n        else mo=$moid1 && vctrl1\n        fi\n    elif [[ -z $moid ]]; then sleep 3\n    fi\nsleep 0.2\ndone\n\nIt will allow volume control with mouse wheel while hover over panel.\n\nA: Also you can use this python script to control volume with mouse wheel from any place of your screen.

I'm happy with the battery life of my phone, I get several days of use between charges. The problem is that the battery indicator is too unreliable.

All the time the GRUB installer fails to install and the system directly boots to Windows 8.1.\nEven when trying with the Ubuntu 15.04 version same thing happening.\nEarlier with the older versions of windows I myself have installed them without much trouble but now UEFI and SECURE Boot is not helping much I guess?\nThe process I am trying to follow is shrinking my D drive in windows. So an unallocated space is created.\nI am inserting the bootable USB selecting the BIOS option of booting through the USB.\nAnd then following the instruction as given normally during the process. Only during the partition I select the Largest free continuous partition to install the Ubuntu system. I am not doing the Manual thing as I am not very much familiar with the process.\nBut at the end the GRUB is failing to install, all the time.\n\nA: You wrote:\n\nI am inserting the bootable USB selecting the BIOS option of booting through the USB.\n\nThis is your problem. You're creating a disk on which Windows is (almost certainly) installed in EFI/UEFI mode and Ubuntu is installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. This makes for a much more complex boot process than if both OSes are installed in the same mode. At best, it means you must use the built-in boot manager or rEFInd to select which OS to boot, and at worst it becomes impossible to switch OSes. Given that you also report that GRUB didn't install, the latter is the case for you.\nYou can probably fix your problem by disabling BIOS/CSM/legacy support in the firmware and either running Boot Repair or installing my rEFInd and the appropriate EFI filesystem driver. Alternatively, after you disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support, you can re-install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: No Boot of either Win7 or Ubuntu After an overwrite of the ubuntu in a dual boot with Win7, laptop won't boot.  The option on re-installing said Replace not wipe the disk. Gparted says that the first partition is Fat32 and only 487 MiB and it's says efi (my machine only has legacy). The second or ubuntu now is 293.89 Gib with Swap at3.73 Gib. \nQuestion is, is my Windows gone?\n\nA: I had similar problem and find answer.first I install windows and boot live ubuntu cd then ubuntu 15.04 automatically divided hdd two part one ntfs and else ext4 and install on ext4 and boot both os normally\n\nA: \nGparted says that the first partition is Fat32 and only 487 MiB and it's says efi (my machine only has legacy).\n\nYour Boot Info Script output indicates that this is an EFI System Partition (ESP). It has the EFI version of GRUB installed on it. Although it's possible to create an ESP and place EFI boot loaders on it using a BIOS-based computer, the Ubuntu installer should never do this. Thus, there are really only two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*You've discovered a bug in the Ubuntu installer.\n\n*You're mistaken and your computer uses an EFI.\n\n\nThe second seems more likely to me. Most computers sold since mid-2011, and a few sold even several years before that, have EFIs. Many of these computers also support BIOS-mode booting via an EFI subsystem called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), so such computers might well boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode; but they are EFI-based and are perfectly capable of booting EFI-based OSes.\n\nQuestion is, is my Windows gone?\n\nYes. Your Boot Info Script output includes:\nPartition    Start Sector    End Sector  # of Sectors System\n/dev/sda1           2,048       999,423       997,376 EFI System partition\n/dev/sda2         999,424   617,328,639   616,329,216 Data partition (Linux)\n/dev/sda3     617,328,640   625,141,759     7,813,120 Swap partition (Linux)\n\nThere's no Windows partition there. If you have important Windows files, see this question and answers for advice about recovering your data. (Hint: You almost certainly won't be able to recover it all, but if you put in enough effort, you can probably recover a few files.)\n\nIs that Fat32 partition whats left of my Windows and why is it so small?\n\nNo, it's the ESP. It was probably created by the Ubuntu installation. A typical size for an ESP is between 100MiB and 600MiB, although it could theoretically be just about any size that can hold a FAT (preferably FAT32) filesystem.\n\nAgain, No UEFI OPTION in BIOS.\n\nThe Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) and its version-2.x variant, Unified EFI (UEFI) is a type of firmware that replaces the old Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware. I know that a lot of people, and even manufacturers and software developers, use the term \"BIOS\" as if it were synonymous with \"firmware,\" but that just muddies the water. In particular, EFI/UEFI is not a BIOS option, and thinking of it as such will lead you astray. Indeed, I've seen EFIs that have \"BIOS setup utility\" or something similar plastered across their setup screens. This is confusing, and it's the reason that I and a few others (like Adam Williamson) are so adamant about not applying the term \"BIOS\" to EFIs.\nAnyhow, stepping back from the soapbox, the point is that the lack of any option called \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" in your firmware doesn't really indicate anything. Also, some EFIs do have CSMs, but the options that control EFI/UEFI-mode booting vs. BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode booting may be labeled \"legacy mode\" or \"CSM.\" If you're not familiar with the terminology, you could easily skip over these options, not understanding their importance. Options might also be hidden unless and until some other unrelated-sounding option is set appropriately. Also, the settings and algorithms that control an EFI's boot mode (EFI/EFI vs. BIOS/CSM/legacy) vary greatly from one machine to another, and can be quite opaque. Thus, predicting the boot mode can be a tricky thing.\nThe bottom line, I'm afraid, is that your Windows installation is hosed. At this point, it sounds like your best bet is to re-install both it and Ubuntu from scratch, possibly attempting file-level recovery of your personal files first.\n", "Q: Share internet over ethernet I have two wired connections of which the first has internet via static IPv4 and gateway and the second connects to another network.\nI want to share internet from first connection over second connection with a different IP-address.\n\nA: I managed to solve this myself.

I used guide How do I remove the proprietary ATI drivers?\nBut it was not the same, much lower fps as with fresh install. \nAny ideas where can be the problem? \nEDIT:\nNow after Proprietary drivers section got updated I have the same issue as this: Revert to open source graphics drivers - options greyed out 14.04\nThank you for help in advance. \n\nA: The Quick Fix (to force the reverting back to the \"xserver-org-video-ati\" open source drivers):\nWe need to make sure that both the \"fglrx-core\" and \"fglrx-updates-core\" software packages are removed.  Only one of those two will be currently installed.  We'll attempt to remove both, just to be safe.\n\n\n*\n\n*In a Terminal:\nsudo apt-get remove fglrx-core\n[give your user's password, then enter \"y\" to proceed]\n\n*sudo apt-get remove fglrx-updates-core\n\n*Reboot. \n\n*Log back in, then go back to \"Additional Drivers\" (search for that in the Dash).  You'll see your video driver choices looking like they used to, and the xserver-org-video-ati choice is selected (not fglrx).  Now leave these choices alone!\nA longer-winded explanation:\nI had the same problem as you, in Ubuntu 15.04 64-bit, but my ATI video card is slightly different:\n# lspci -k | grep VGA -A2\n00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. \\\n    [AMD/ATI] Richland [Radeon HD 8510G]\n    Subsystem: Toshiba America Info Systems Device fa16\n    Kernel driver in use: fglrx_pci\n\nMy laptop is a Toshiba L50D-A.\nI was stuck myself, with \"fglrx_pci\" effectively being shown (by lspci) as used (not \"radeon\", which is what you'll see when the \"xserver-org-video-ati\" driver is being used in \"Software Updates\" -> \"Additional Drivers\"), experiencing very sluggish video performance, and the \"Additional Drivers\" video driver choices being locked, unchangeably, on \"Continue using a manually installed driver\".\nThis suggests the problem is not just with your specific video chipset, but with (some? all?) ATI chipsets in general.\nWhat's shocking to me is that one effectively could not even revert back to the open source driver.  That is to say that currently it's a trap, to even attempt to use the provided ATI proprietary driver choices, after a fresh Ubuntu install.\nATI has had a long-standing reputation for having poor proprietary video drivers in Linux.  I suppose it was nice of them that they made them at all.\nThese various Ubuntu forums are rife with ATI problems, and they never really seem to go away.  ATI's driver testing employees clearly don't do thorough testing, when it comes to a laptop suspending/waking up (and then switching between users after doing so).\nIn the future, you'd do well to NOT BUY ATI VIDEO CHIPSETS IN THE FIRST PLACE, if you want to use Ubuntu.  This might eventually encourage ATI to spend more on software driver testing for Linux (if they see that they are losing money, because customers are choosing competing products instead).\nYou'd also do well not to shut-the-laptop-lid-to-suspend, thereby asking for trouble (although this seemed to work OK using the Open Source \"xserver-org-video-ati\" driver for me.  YMMV).\nNote: with the proprietary \"fglrx_pci\" driver, I could get 120 fps in Extreme Tux Racer.  With the open source \"radeon\" driver, I could get 60 fps.  That 60 fps is a rather decent framerate for me (in the sense that it sure feels like there IS hardware acceleration), making me not care about taking risks with the ATI proprietary drivers again.  \nAlso Note: My semi-transparent misty Unity Dash once again opens nice and fast with the \"radeon\" driver as well, compared to a sluggish, no-transparency Dash (experienced during the \"stuck, no-acceleration fglrx\" problem above).\n", "Q: Which of these drivers would help my computer resume from suspend? When I resume from suspend, I get a garbled display for a half-minute and then I will either get to the lock screen for the session I had or else booted back to the greeter, with my session and open applications/files lost.\nWould switching to Noveau help this?

I mean what are they, are these all directories or partitions or what? And why do they appear under \"mounted on\"? How does that bit work. I assume the /dev/sda1 is my solid state drive? So now if I install applications, which one of these directories does my software get installed  into? I assume it just gets installs in the / directory (I haven't even got a clue what the / directory is). Can someone explain what the other directories are and what they are used for?\n\nA: So according to your post, nobody can tell you, on which device the partitions are located.\nIt looks like your system is using one partition for both system and home directory, so the only interesting line is\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1       219G   29G  180G  14% /\n\nSo the size of this partition is 219G, 29G are used, and 180G are available.\n\nA: The list is various directories that are mounted to different filesystems.  Most of them are tmpfs filesystems, which is like a ramdisk.  They only hold temporary data while the system is running and are not stored anywhere on disk.  Your root directory is mounted to /dev/sda1, which is the first partition on your primary hard disk.\n\nA: If you run df -h you'll get the result of your HDD with a list of additional lines. The most, you should mention the lines that start with /dev/sda those are parts of your HDD as stated you can also check your layout with lsblk and there's one thing if you run sudo parted -l the results will be different from df -h and lsblk about disk capacity and also means about free space indeed.\nsudo parted -l will show you the exact capacity of your HDD. Why do the results differ? Take a look at tune2fs, by default Linux systems reserve about 5% of space on each partition, you can run:\nsudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep -i reserved\n\nThis will show you your reserved blocks count, thus for example if you run:\nsudo tune2fs -m 3 /dev/sda1\n\nWhich means to reserve 3% on the partition instead of 5% which will encrease your HDD space. For example if you have a seperate Home or media partition where you keep only music and videos you can set its value to 1% or even 0% reserved to have a complete space available for the data.\n", "Q: uni gitanjali in lubuntu In Ubuntu we have multiple choice to type in Bengali language.

My suggestion for that would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use ls -l ~ and ls -l ~/Downloads \n\n*If you don't find it, try using locate Downloads\n\n*If you find it and it as the data save it somewhere  using cp -r\nOnce this is done, you can try to correct your configuration problem.\n\nThe configuration file user-dirs.dirs is automatically updated by the system at boot so changing it by hand will not help. \nTo change it, you should use xdg-user-dirs (should already be installed otherwise: sudo apt-get install xdg-user-dirs):\n\n\n*\n\n*By changing the default values in the file:\n/etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults\n\n*By using the command:\nxdg-user-dirs-update --set DOWNLOAD $HOME/Downloads\nNOTE: user-dirs.dirs~ is just a dummy file created by your editor when you edited the real file.

You can do this by opening a terminal, then enter:\ngedit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs\n\nChange the entry for XDG_DOWNLOADS_DIR to your new Downloads folder, or add it, if the entry does not exist.

Checking it is advisable.\n\n\nA: It sounds like you're encountering I/O errors. Such problems are usually caused by failing hardware. If you're lucky, this might be something simple and cheap to fix like a loose or defective cable. It could also be a failing hard disk, though. I recommend you run a SMART test on your hard disk. If you need help interpreting the results, post back with details. (Edit your question to include a screen shot or paste text-mode output to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here.)\nI/O errors can also be caused by buggy drivers. This is pretty rare, though. If your problems occur only in one OS, that might be the explanation.\nYet another possibility is that the Host Protected Area (HPA) may be set. This can sometimes cause problems, especially if you mix older and newer Linux kernels, since some older kernels ignore the HPA, causing a mis-match in perceived disk size and where GPT backup data structures reside. I don't think this hypothesis explains your symptoms all that well, but it's worth mentioning. You can type sudo hdparm -N /dev/sda to see if HPA is enabled on /dev/sda.\n", "Q: 15.04 32 bit unstable wifi So this has been a long time problem that I hoped would get fixed with some software updates.

So, I got a directory filled with other directories, and I was wondering if it was possible to remove files that have no size. Typically these files are 0 bytes and since I want to merge all these subdirs I could replace a perfectly legit file with a weightless 0 byte file, and there goes my legit file. Any way to remove the zero byte files?\n\nA: Find and remove all files with a size of 0 recursively:\nfind . -type f -size 0 -print0 | xargs -I{} -0 rm {}\n\nExample:\n% ls -og   \ntotal 4\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 0 Jun  7 20:31 bar\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 5 Jun  7 20:29 foo\n\n% find . -size 0 -print0 | xargs -I{} -0 rm {}\n\n% ls -og                                      \ntotal 4\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 5 Jun  7 20:29 foo\n\n\nA: You can also do it directly in the shell. This could be useful if you don't want to delete empty hidden files (those whose name begins with a .). While you could do that with find as well, an alternative would be to use the shell itself:\nshopt -s globstar\nfor file in **/*; do [ ! -s \"$file\" ] && [ -f \"$file\" ] && rm \"$file\"; done\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*shopt -s globstar : turns on the globstar option for bash which makes ** match one or more subdirectories. **/* will match all files and directories in the current directory and all its subdirectories.\n\n*for file in **/*; do ...; done : iterate over all files and directories found;\n\n*[ ! -s \"$file\" ] : [ -s \"$file\" ] is true if the file exists and is not empty. Therefore, [ ! -s \"$file\" ] (the ! inverses the test) is true if the file doesn't exist or if it is empty. \n\n*[ -f \"$file\" ] : true if the file is a regular file. Not a directory or a device file or a symlink etc.\n\n*rm \"$file\" : delete the file.\n\n\nThe && ensure that the next command is only run if the previous one was successful so this will only delete empty, regular files. \n\nA: Use the Find command to find files by size and print file names to standard output.\nfind . -type f -size 0b -print\n\nsubstitute -print with -delete to delete the files rather than print them on screen.\nfind . -type f -size 0b -delete\n\n\nA: Although most answer above is correct, take a look for this command:\n\nA 0 byte sized file means an empty file \n\nthough you can run this command:\nfind . -type f -empty -delete\n\nthis will delete all empty files.\nYou can take a look for those files before delete:\nfind . -type f -empty\n\n", "Q: Running .reg files with wine I am having trouble running .reg files with wine.

This will install the complete MATE Desktop Environment as well as LightDM and numerous other applications to provide a full and well rounded desktop.\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-mate-core ubuntu-mate-desktop\n\n\nA: You can remove your current desktop and install mate-desktop.\nIf that's what you want to do.\nSwitch on your computer.\nPress and hold the Shift key, which will bring up the Grub menu.\nSelect the line which starts with --- Advanced options.\nSelect the line ending with --- recovery mode .\nYour PC should display a menu with a number of options. \nSelect network  --- root or netroot.\nIn a terminal run:\n  # mount -o remount, rw /\n  # mount --all\n  # apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-mate-dev/ppa\n  # apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-mate-dev/trusty-mate\n  # apt-get update\n  # apt-get dist-upgrade\n  # apt-get install --reinstall aptitude deborphan ubuntu-mate-core ubuntu-mate-desktop\n  # aptitude remove '?and(?reverse-depends(gnome),?not(?reverse-depends(?exact-name(ubuntu-mate-desktop))))'\n  # aptitude remove '?and(?reverse-depends(unity),?not(?reverse-depends(?exact-name(ubuntu-mate-desktop))))'\n  # apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-mate-core ubuntu-mate-desktop\n  # deborphan\n  # apt-get --purge remove $(deborphan)\n  # deborphan --libdevel\n  # apt-get --purge remove $(deborphan --libdevel)\n  # deborphan --find-config\n  # dpkg --purge $(deborphan --find-config)\n  # apt-get autoremove\n  # apt-get clean\n  # reboot\n\n\nA: If your meaning of like 11 is: not this terrible unity thing, then you have a choice of many desktops. Gnu/Linux has many desktops, there are just programs, not OS versions. \nAll you have to do is install a different desktop. There is KDE, Gnome, xfce, lxde, 9wm, aewm, afterstep, awesome, blackbox, ctwm, dwm, flwm, fvwm …\nThen select it before login.\nTry some out.\nMost of these will be part of Ubuntu, no need for PPAs.\n", "Q: Synaptic 'Complete Removal' messed my system I'm having a bad time trying to flash a android ROM in my phone. It almost take me to the need of using windows again for runing 'Odin'. After searching I found 'Heimdall', but has some problems installing it the first time.\nWhen trying again I first came to Synaptic to remove the first heimdall packages and make another clean install. So I checked 'Complete Removal' to one heimdall package, and it told me that my action would act in other various packages, but in this moment I believed that it was ok. Well, after restarting the system my terminal turned lo-profile, my status bar, clock, program dock and everything just vanished.\nHow to clean up this mess I've just made to my system? Thank you so much.\n\nA: You can look to /var/log/apt/history.log and see what has been removed.\nThen just re-install what is missing.\nI would suggest to start with\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nThis may be enough.\n", "Q: How do I fix this main menu that shows generic application names? I was playing around somewhere tweaking my Xubuntu main menu. All I can see now is the generic names for the installed applications, for example, Google Chrome and Firefox both are displayed as Web Browser. How can restore it?\n\n\nA: After playing around a little more, I figured out myself the solution.\nRight clicking on the main menu > properties opens the Applications Menu, where there exist a checkbox that says Show generic application names, uncheck it.\n\nNow everything looks great! \n\n", "Q: UEFI boot order depending if usb stick is plugged I want to tryout Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

(This is the BootOrder: line in the efibootmgr output.) These entries point to EFI program files stored on an EFI System Partition (ESP), to network devices, and so on. You can have multiple ESPs, and each ESP can have multiple EFI boot files. If one boot file fails, the ESP should drop back to the next one in its list.\nYour problem is that, although Ubuntu is installed on your USB flash drive, that flash drive has no ESP, and it looks as if GRUB has been installed in the ESP on the hard disk. Unfortunately, your GRUB configuration relies on configuration files on the USB drive, so if the USB drive is unplugged when GRUB launches, GRUB will drop back to a grub> prompt, but it won't fail in the sense of returning to the EFI so that the EFI can launch the next boot loader. When you first installed Ubuntu, this GRUB was set as the default boot loader, so you saw the type of failure you describe. You changed the default to Windows, which causes it to boot correctly, but makes it harder to boot Ubuntu. There are several ways to clean this up:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can live with it as-is and use the computer's built-in boot manager (the F9 key you mention) to select which OS to boot. This solution is the safest one, since it involves no changes that might make matters worse.\n\n*You can attempt to reconfigure GRUB to read its configuration file from the ESP rather than from your Ubuntu /boot directory, then reset GRUB as the default. GRUB should then present a boot menu, which will enable you to select your desired OS a bit easier. I'm a bit rusty on how to do this, though. Check this old documentation page for all the gory details (and then some). Note that GRUB won't automatically select Ubuntu if and only if the USB drive is plugged in -- or at least, if it can be configured to do that, I don't know how.\n\n*You can repartition your internal hard disk to include an Ubuntu /boot partition and copy its files there. You'll then need to re-install GRUB. In theory, it should then work whether or not the USB drive is plugged in, but it won't automatically select Ubuntu when the USB drive is plugged in and Windows when it's not plugged in. This option is one of the riskiest ones, since it involves resizing your on-disk partitions.\n\n*Create an ESP on your USB flash drive and install GRUB there using the fallback filename of EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. (The installation procedure is likely to be a bit convoluted, though.) You can then use your boot manager (F9) to switch between the USB drive (GRUB/Ubuntu) and Windows. Some EFIs might let you set the USB drive as default if it's plugged in, which would give you the automatic boot to Ubuntu when it's available that you want, but I can't promise this detail will work as you want. You'll definitely need to repartition the USB drive (which adds a bit of risk), and you may need to convert the disk from MBR to GPT. One advantage of this approach is that the USB drive should be independently bootable on just about any EFI-based computer of the same architecture.\n\n*You can install my rEFInd boot manager to your ESP. With a few configuration tweaks (mainly setting default_selection vmlinuz,Windows or something similar in its refind.conf file), it should boot Ubuntu by default when the USB drive is plugged in and Windows when the USB drive is not plugged in.\n\n\nThere may be other possible solutions, too, but these are the ones that spring to mind. The best of these are probably leaving it as-is, creating an ESP on your USB drive and re-installing GRUB there, and using rEFInd.\n", "Q: Stuck at boot screen after update: Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 Yesterday, I did the automated software update for ubuntu gnome 14.04, and the machine has stopped booting since then.\nThe upgrade gives out a new kernel which is 3.13.0-53-generic\nfrom the previous  3.13.0.24-generic\nAll I get is the infinite wait at the gnome boot screen.\nI am using a Thinkpad E430, This is the first time I encountered such an error, If any furthur info (logs etc.) are required, I can provide the same.\n\nupdate:\ndoes this help??\n\nA: The Issue is fixed, My gdm was broken.\nI referred to this thread for help..\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2231856\nI found out when I did\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\nafter which all I had to do was \nsudo apt-get install gdm\n", "Q: How to fix black screen after Intel Graphics Installer on 14.10?

I'm currently using Samba for the household, but NFS is faster for me since I use Ubuntu (everyone else, except the NAS, are running Windows).\nWhat I want to do is create some NFS shares that are Read Only for everyone except my machine. I have the NFS shares working ok, as in I can mount them on my computer and browse the folders, but I'm forced to be read-only on them, which is frustrating since I've declared in my config/export that my machines be read/write.\nMy /etc/exports file looks like this (for example of one line - there are sevral like this with the same result):\n/mnt/TVShows    matt-pc.*(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check) 192.168.1.0/25(ro,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)\n\nmatt-pc.1 and matt-pc.2 are both defined in the NAS's hosts file. But regardless of that, hard coding the IPs doesn't work, either. \nThis doesn't work either:\n/mnt/TVShows    matt-pc.*(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check) *(ro,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)\n\nI can still only read-only mount.\nThe drives are mounted as Read/Write on the NAS, and my Samba shares settings work fine (I can force login as my user account on the NAS, and be able to read and write files).\nIf I format the shares like this:\n/mnt/TVShows    matt-pc.*(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)\n\nI just get permissions errors when trying to mount on the client machine (my machine).\nThis is how I'm mounting on my client machine:\nnas.local:/mnt/TVShows  /mnt/NFS/TVShows nfs auto,noatime,nolock,bg,nfsvers=4,intr,tcp,actimeo=1800 0 0\n\nCan I work this?\n\nA: To export /mnt/TVShows as rw from nas to matt-pc and ro to all other you could write this in `/etc/exports:\n#\n/mnt/TVShows matt-pc(rw,no_subtree_check) 192.168.1.0/24(ro)\n\nNotice that the order is important. The first machine name/IP/network that maches is used when exporting to one machine, so have most specific machine first and most general last. Do not end with a catch all that gives to much rights. \nAlso remember that each set of options is inherent to next, so you only need to be specific on first. The rest is only changes from previous settings. Also avoid set opinions you don't need. (And always read relevant man(1) pages and documentation in /usr/share/doc/\"package name\"/)\nAlso check how the names you are using are resolved properly. To use that, use the getent(1) command.  Like this:\n$ getent hosts matt-pc\n\nAnd how that works depend on the resolv.conf and /etc/hosts  (or actually the contents of /etc/nsswitch.conf).\nTo mount you do like this from each machine:\n/etc/fstab\n# ro, that is this line in all but matt-pc\nnas.local:/mnt/TVShows  /mnt/NFS/TVShows nfs auto,ro,noatime,nolock,bg,nfsvers=4,intr,tcp 0 0\n# rw, that is this line in only matt-pc\nnas:/mnt/TVShows  /mnt/NFS/TVShows nfs auto,rw,noatime,nfsvers=4,tcp 0 0\n\nNotice though that don't use more arguments than you really need.\n(Yes, I prefer to have disks on servers mounted under /srv/, as that is for server resources, and /mnt/ is more for temporary mountings.  I usually have /srv/web/, /srv/files/music/, /srv/files/video etc.  It maskes it easier to make backups)\n", "Q: Where is the system-wide $PATH variable set?

Is there any way to \"port\" those settings ,or whatever is affecting it, to Ubuntu?\n\nA: There are multiple probable causes for this behaviour.\nWhat first comes to mind is that the USB current exceeds it's maximum. This causes the USB controller to reset and so the drive doesn't work. The mouse receiver uses less power so it works. You probably need to connect the drive using a powered USB hub, or connect it to the USB 3.0 hub.\nA less likely cause is that this particular drive causes the USB hub to reset on ATA probing (not power related). There have been bug reports about this some time ago.

Unfortunately i could complete this task. It seems that the solution must have been the creation of a Virtual drive(as suggested by Germar). Did that and did the whole process from the beginning. but when i had to apt-get while chroot, i was getting errors saying that it cant connect to the ppa site. while trying to fix that with some things found on the internet, the VM stoped working and now doesnt boot at all! I guess that the best way to create a live cd from an installation of ubuntu on the hard drive is to actually have ubuntu on the hard drive and not on some VM.\nThanks again(not sure if i should delete this or not, but i will keep it for future reference)\n\nA: errno codes sometimes aren't very specific.  As well as possibly meaning that the specific file at hand (/bin/bash) doesn't exist, when executing a program \"No such file or directory\" (ENOENT) can also mean that its ELF interpreter doesn't exist, or that one of the shared libraries it needs doesn't exist.  I suspect that /lib or /lib64 inside the chroot environment you're building is broken somehow, perhaps because symlinks are pointing to the wrong places.\nTry ls -l $WORK/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, and if it reports a symlink then try likewise for whatever the target of that symlink is except relative to $WORK (so if ls says that the link points to /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.19.so, then you'd run ls -l $WORK/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.19.so).  Repeat for the various library paths under /lib listed in the output of ldd until you find the thing that's actually missing in the context of the chroot.\n", "Q: how to make any digital pen work in ubuntu 14.04? i have just bought a digital pen called portronics electropen 2 which connects to computer so that one can make digital notes using real ink and paper it is somewhat like livescribe but uses no special paper. here is the website of the device http://www.portronics.com/electropen-2.html , i was hoping is there's any way i can make it work in ubuntu as i do not want to leave ubuntu and start using windows just for the pen. the mfg provides for the software for windows but no support for linux. is there's any generic driver or app for this kind of pen.\n\nA: I did some snooping around and was also unable to find anything Linux related with this device.  There is no such thing as an OS-generic driver, since drivers are OS-dependent.\nIf you really want to use this pen with ubuntu, you might try WINE (https://www.winehq.org)\nWith WINE, you can run Windows programs just like Ubuntu programs.

The command aconnect -lio always shows these entries:\nclient 0: 'System' [type=noyau]\n    0 'Timer           '\n    1 'Announce        '\nclient 14: 'Midi Through' [type=noyau]\n    0 'Midi Through Port-0'\n\nThe “Midi Through” client has an obvious meaning, as it is standard in the MIDI world, and is easily used. The “Timer” port of the “System” client has a rather obvious abstract meaning, but there seems to be no documentation about it. The “Announce” port looks mysterious and is unknown of standard MIDI devices (or it is just to me). Searching the web about the “Timer” and “Announce” ports, for a long time, gave nothing.\nQuestions: Is there some pointers to learn more about the “Timer” and “Announce” ports of the “System” client? I mean, with answers to this kind of questions: what message can be received/sent from/to it, and how to start/stop/configure (especially for the “Timer”).\nThis is mainly a platform or system documentation question, but as it is also ALSA related, I'm unsure if it's best to post it here or on StackOverflow. Please, accept my apologizes if my guess was wrong.\n\nA: That's OK, I found a documentation for it, it was in ALSA API documentation (I just missed it on the first look):\nALSA project - the C library reference (alsa-project.org)\n\nA sequencer core has two pre-defined system ports on the system client SND_SEQ_CLIENT_SYSTEM: SND_SEQ_PORT_SYSTEM_TIMER and SND_SEQ_PORT_SYSTEM_ANNOUNCE. The SND_SEQ_PORT_SYSTEM_TIMER is the system timer port, and SND_SEQ_PORT_SYSTEM_ANNOUNCE is the system announce port. In order to control a queue from a client, client should send a queue-control event like start, stop and continue queue, change tempo, etc. to the system timer port. Then the sequencer system handles the queue according to the received event. This port supports subscription. The received timer events are broadcasted to all subscribed clients.\n\nAbout SND_SEQ_PORT_SYSTEM_ANNOUNCE:\n\nThe latter port does not receive messages but supports subscription. When each client or port is attached, detached or modified, an announcement is sent to subscribers from this port.\n\nEx. from SND_SEQ_PORT_SYSTEM_TIMER, one may receive SND_SEQ_EVENT_START events and from SND_SEQ_PORT_SYSTEM_ANNOUNCE, one may receive SND_SEQ_EVENT_PORT_SUBSCRIBED events.\nIt appears I should have posted this on StackOverflow rather than on AskUbuntu.

It is because I don't utilize precious C: for something other than windows source and program files.\nAlso just curious, could both OS use some common drive in dual boot . For example there is a G: drive of 100 gb which would have contents shared by both the OS's.\nSorry for a noob question but most of the tutorials out there install in the same drive ( or shrink) the C drive \n\nA: Yes, it can be done.  My main PC has Windows 8.1 installed on one physical drive and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed on a different physical drive.  There is a third physical drive which is accessible from either OS.  This all works great.\nHowever, both OS's did store their EFI boot information in the same partition on one of the drives.  I do not know if it has to be this way. I had created an EFI partition on Ubuntu's physical drive, but the installer used the one on the Windows physical drive. I was told this might happen, and it did.\nI have the shared physical drive formatted as ntfs, because this started out as a Windows PC.  This may be required anyway, because I don't think Windows can use an ext4 formatted partition.  I am not 100% sure of that though.\nAs you can tell, I am certainly no Linux expert, but with a great deal of study and prep, and the help of people on this site, I managed to do this installation without any problems.

It's got 5x 3TB Hard Drives on there which are completely independant of the operating system (i.e. the OS was installed on a separate hard drive).

With that, back up your data, and when you install ubuntu server you can format the drives as a linux raid, then restore your data.\n", "Q: I Get 'Import error : No module named MYSQLdb' in python 2.7.

I want to run multiple commands over ssh (some scp's, some rsync's, and then some ssh commands), but the server has brute force blocking and even though my authentication is fine if I run too many connections in a bash script I get blocked automatically. How can I run the commands I need without getting blocked?\nOnce possibility: Somebody suggested using ControlMaster in my .ssh/config file so if I open a terminal, open one ssh connection, then all other connections in another terminal won't need to reauthenticate. How can I do that in a bash script? i.e. How do I open one terminal and keep it open till a second terminal runs some commands then close both?\n\nA: SSH connection multiplexing or connection sharing might solve your problem.  Take a look at this ssh multiplexing wiki.  It might be able to cut down the number of connections you are making to the server and therefore not trigger the brute force settings. \nTo answer the second part of the question -- How to do this in a bash script/close other windows.  You can probably simplify the problem using ssh keys and a persistent connection.    \n\n\n*\n\n*Look at persistent connections that will keep the ssh session open for a set amount of time.  Here is a previous answer that covers some of this.\n\n*Look at implementing key based logins without a password.  This will allow your scripts to login without a password.  Github has good instructions here.\n", "Q: No sound, very small icon.

So I've been trying to do a clean install of Ubuntu instead. \nI followed the UEFI tutorial, turned off fast boot, and turned of secure boot.\nWhen I try to boot Ubuntu from a USB it tells me there's no Operating system on the drive. It clearly is because I can see the files after I burned them onto the USB, stuff like Wubi.  I tried using Wubi from my desktop instead of the USB and it says its not compatible with EFI. How can I do a complete clean install of Ubuntu? I've had it before on another computer, but cant seem to figure it out on this one. I don’t want Windows 8 or Windows 10!

So if I give Windows 8 more space to begin with, will I be able to give Ubuntu more space later if I change my mind?\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes, but this would be easily done using the Ubuntu Live USB because it would not be using the Ubuntu or Windows OS partition while loaded.\nFrom within the Ubuntu Live USB you can open Dash and run GParted. From there simply resize whichever you want to have more/less space and done. After reboot each one will refresh the amount of space for their respective partitions.\nFor the cases I had worked on which are similar to your question, they normally tend to be because they can't share information between both systems. In case this is also your case (You would have to confirm just in  case it is), then my suggestion is to run the Ubuntu Live USB as mentioned above, but this time, create a 3rd partition in either FAT32 or NTFS. This way, this partition can be the bridge between sharing both systems the same information.\nNote that, since you are talking about Windows 8, I will assumed it was pre-installed, so for this case, the recommended version of Ubuntu should be 15.04 to avoid other problems mentioned in the Windows 8 Pre-installed answer.\n", "Q: Lost login password Installed Ubuntu for first time and when I restarted I could not remember my password.

The effect trickles down to PulseAudio, so it's 100% compatible.\nIt's just one command:\nsudo modprobe snd-aloop\n\nTada, from there you will have a virtual audio device. Playing to it as input will result in its output, just as VAC does. However, in pulse audio, it will also show up named as, \"Built-in Audio Analog Stereo\" - this is probably a bug needing to be fixed in pulse audio. But you'll notice there are two of them, one will be your virtual/loopback device.\nThis is just temporary, but if you want to make it permanent, then add it to your /etc/modules files.\n", "Q: Filesystem recovery using Ubuntu I have accumulated a number of failed pc's and would like to retrieve all data from them.\nThey all have some form of Windows and I would like to know whether it is possible to remove their hard drives and install them into a server running Ubuntu from a live-usb or is there a better way?\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu is capable of mounting NTFS (and FAT32) file-systems by default, so moving your assorted drives into a single machine then booting it from a live-usb will make them accessible.\nI'd also advise you to look through the following links in detail as they should help you understand better what you are trying to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Understanding file systems\n\n*6 Ways the Linux File System is Different From the Windows File System\n\n*Linux: Mount a Windows file system from Linux\n", "Q: Why my cronjob was launched on the bad day?

For example,    ``30 4 1,15 * 5''\n  would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each\n  month,    plus every Friday. \n\nSo, what you need to do is make your command test the time. Just like you do for making it run only once. Since this is getting kind of complicated, I would recommend having the check done in your script itself and then launching the cron command every day of the relevant month. Something like\n## Check if this is a weekday \n[ $(date '+%u') -le 5 ] && [ $(date '+%u') -ge 1 ] || exit;\n## Make sure it only runs once. If yesterday was also a weekday and \n## date >=3 and <=5, we can assume the script ran then and should exit. \n[ $(date -d yesterday '+%u') -le 5 ] && [ $(date -d yesterday '+%u') -ge 1 ] && \n [ $(date -d yesterday '+%d') -le 3 ] && [ $(date -d yesterday '+%d') -ge 5  ] && exit;\n## Rest of your script goes here\n[...]\n\nThen, from cron, launch your script only on days 3-5 of every month:\n7 0 3-5 * *  /path/to/my/script.sh\n\n", "Q: How do I replace some 32 bit packages with 64 bit ones?

I have installed Ubuntu over the weekend and run into 10000 problems, one of which was this exact issue.  I used these set of commands below to make it work. It's important that you follow the order that I issue the commands & also that you modify where it says \"johnsmith\" to your username within your home directory.\nrm -rf ~/.steam\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/Steam\nsudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dri:i386\n\nNow you need to run steam so that it downloads the files. You then need to modify one of the files it installs with the commands below.\ncd /home/johnsmith/.steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/i386/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu\nmv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.bak\n\nThat's it. If you couldn't navigate to the directory, I've seen some users say that the final file is located in the directory below instead.\n cd /home/johnsmith/.steam/steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/i386/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu\n\n", "Q: bash: syntax error near unexpected token `(' in README of trainset14_032015.rdp for mothur I'm trying to run the README for the use of the trainset14_032015.rdp in mothur (http://blog.mothur.org/2014/10/28/RDP-v10-reference-files/), but when I get to this step it doesn't work, showing this error:\n$ tax_file <- scan(file=\"trainset14_032015_rmdup.tax\", what=\"\", sep=\"\\n\", quiet=TRUE)\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nSo, I read and put some \"\" or '' at the beginning and end of the (), but it didn't work, because it now says the file doesn't exist, and it does!\n$ tax_file <- scan\"(file='/home/eugenia/Desktop/trainset14/trainset14_032015_rmdup.tax',what=\"\", seq=\"\\n\", quiet=TRUE)\"\nbash: -: No such file or directory\n\nwhat should I do?\n\nA: Those aren't bash commands, they're R commands. It doesn't say so explicitly in the README for some reason, but the <- is a dead giveaway. I don't know what mothur is but these commands from the README you show should all be run in R, not bash:\ntax <- read.table(file=\"trainset10_082014_rmdup.tax\", sep=\"\\t\")\ntax$V2 <- gsub(\" \", \"_\", tax$V2)    #remove spaces and replace with '_'\ntax$V2 <- gsub(\"[^;]*_incertae_sedis$\", \"\", tax$V2)\ntax$V2 <- gsub('\\\"', '', tax$V2) #remove quote marks\n\nand\nlevels <- read.table(file=\"trainset10_db_taxid.txt\", sep=\"*\", stringsAsFactors=F)\nsubs <- levels[grep(\"sub\", levels$V5),]\nsub.names <- subs$V2\n\ntax.split <- strsplit(tax$V2, split=\";\")\n\nremove.subs <- function(tax.vector){\n    return(tax.vector[which(!tax.vector %in% sub.names)])\n}\n\nno.subs <- lapply(tax.split, remove.subs)\nno.subs.str <- unlist(lapply(no.subs, paste, collapse=\";\"))\nno.subs.str <- gsub(\"^Root;(.*)$\", \"\\\\1;\", no.subs.str)\n\nand \nwrite.table(cbind(as.character(tax$V1), no.subs.str), \"trainset10_082014.rdp.tax\", row.names=F, col.names=F, quote=F, sep=\"\\t\")\n\nAll the above commands, which as mentioned should be run in R, prepare your file for use with mothur. They simply modify the file containing the taxonomy information so that it is compatible with mothur. The author of the post has chosen to use R for the formatting steps.\nSo, you need to run the commands I have quoted here in R (open a terminal, run R and paste the commands in R's interactive shell). The ones I have not quoted here should be run in bash.\n", "Q: Import users from CSV file Is it possible to import users by using CSV file? or something like a LDAP connection to import all users?\n\nA: Here is an awk one-liner:\nsudo awk -F',' '{ command=\"useradd -p $( mkpasswd \"$2\" ) \"$1;print command; system(command) }' userlist.txt\nOr for readability, here's the format:\nsudo awk -F',' '{ \n            command=\"useradd -p $(mkpasswd \"$2 \")\" $1; \n            print command; \n            system(command)\n           }' userlist.txt\n\nExplanation:\nawk's system function allows running shell commands while awk is processing entries from text file. We create a variable \"command\" that is just text of the command we want to run. Using comma as field separator -F',' , we take field #2 and #1 and place them to match syntax of the useradd command. Once the text of the command is assembled, system(command) executes useradd -p $(mkpasswd password) username , for each line of the text. print command part is optional, merely for debugging and verifying that all usernames have been processed\nAddition:\nThe oneliner can be turned into an awk script like so:\n#!/usr/bin/awk -f\n\n\nBEGIN {FS=\",\";}\n\n{ \n     command=\"useradd -p $(mkpasswd \"$2\") \" $1; \n     print command; \n    system( command )\n}\n\nNow make sure the script has executable permissions with sudo chmod +x script-name.awk and run it with any input file like so sudo ./awkscript.sh userlist.txt if it is in your current working directory, or you can call that script anywhere by placing it into one of the $PATH directories\nPossible , in the password\nTo take into account possibility of having comma in password, I suggest you use sub() function. Sub function changes first instance of a character or word in each line. In other words, if we have an entry such as testuser,foo,bar, where foo,bar is password, and we change first entry to space, we can use awk normally , without telling it to use -F',' flag. Awk will translate each entry to testuser  foo,bar, and treat testuser as $1 and foo,bar as $2. To put this into code:\nsudo awk  '{ sub(\",\",\" \");command=\"useradd -p $( mkpasswd \"$2\" ) \"$1;print command; system(command) }' userlist.txt\n\nA: Here is a python solution:\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nimport subprocess, crypt\n\nwith open('/path/to/file.csv') as f:\n    for line in f:\n        i = line.find(',')\n        name = line[:i]\n        password = line.rstrip()[i+1:]\n        encpt_passwd = crypt.crypt(password, '2b')\n        command = 'useradd -m -p {0} {1}'.format(encpt_passwd, name).split()\n        subprocess.call(command)\n\nThis will handle passwords having commas.\n\n\n*\n\n*line.find(',') will find the lowest index of , in each line of the file\n\n*line[:i] will take the slice of the line containg the username\n\n*line.rstrip()[i+1:] will contain the password\n\n*crypt module generates encrypted password from input of the form crypt.crypt(password, salt). encpt_passwd will contain the encrypted password. In crypt.crypt(password, '2b'), password is the saved plain password and 2b is the salt.\n\n*subprocess.call(command) will simply run the command to generate users\n\nA: I have a shorter awk version (@Serg =)):\nFirst install whois, we need the command mkpasswd\nsudo apt-get install whois\n\nThan you can use this oneliner:\nawk -F',' '{print \"Create user: \"$1; system(\"sudo useradd -p $(mkpasswd \"$2\") \"$1)}' users\n\nor without any output:\nawk -F',' '{system(\"sudo useradd -p $(mkpasswd \"$2\") \"$1)}' users\n\n\nContent of users: \nfoo,foopasswd\nbar,password\nfoobar,foobar\n\nThe user name is in the first column, the unencrypted password in the 2nd column.\n\nIn fairness, I mention a problem here. Passwords can not include a comma.\n\nA: There's an app for that! The newusers tool which is part of the passwd package is designed to batch create users:\nDESCRIPTION\n   The newusers command reads a file (or the standard input by default)\n   and uses this information to update a set of existing users or to\n   create new users. Each line is in the same format as the standard\n   password file (see passwd(5)) with the exceptions explained below:\n\nYou will need to create a file with this format:\nusername:passwd:UID:GID:full name,room number,work phone,home phone,other:directory:shell\n\nMany of these can be ignored and the default values will be used. You only need to specify the username and password. For example:\ntom:password1:::::\ndanny:password2:::::\n\nIf I save that as users.txt and run this command:\nsudo newusers < users.txt \n\nThe users are created:\n$ grep -E 'tom|danny' /etc/passwd\ntom:x:1005:1006:::\ndanny:x:1006:1007:::\n\n\nA: With a script you can. This needs a file with user and password commaseparated:\nwhile IFS=\",\" read -r user passwd ; do      \n        echo \"useradd -m -p $(mkpasswd \"$passwd\") $user\"\ndone < /home/$USER/Downloads/users.txt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*mkpasswd can be installed with sudo apt-get install whois\n\n*Change the , to a ; if you need that. \n\n\nSave this as users.sh and set permissions with chmod +x users.sh\nIf you then do\n./users.sh > users_create.sh\n\nYou get a text file with all the commands so you can verify it and \nchmod +x users.sh\n./users_create.sh\n\nwill then create them.\n\nTesting\nExample file:\nwdn,password123 \nwdn2,password345\n\nsaved as \"users.txt\" in \"~/Downloads\".\nExecute script:\n./users.sh \nuseradd -m -p acBNi2tbw9iaw wdn\nuseradd -m -p OHOzeMGqbcMso wdn2\n\nand\n./users.sh  > users_create.sh\n~/Downloads$ more users_create.sh \nuseradd -m -p Q1BVotdoA3ucI wdn\nuseradd -m -p siUX7mYTYw.3A wdn2\n\n(password are encrypted).\nAfter this all you need to do is execute is to make this executable with chmod +x users.sh and execute it with ./users_create.sh (I did not do that last bit so if not working please comment).\n\nA: My AWK version has a problem with , in the password. Here is my perl version:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse Text::CSV;\n\nmy $file = $ARGV[0];\nopen my $fh, \"<\", $file or die \"$file: $!\";\n\nmy $csv = Text::CSV->new ({\n    binary    => 1, # Allow special character.

It doesn't need an active internet connection.\n\nA: Using FTP\nHere is another way to easily transfer files between your laptop and Android phone.\nPrerequisite:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ES File Explorer (File Manager) on your Android\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*If both your Android and Ubuntu are connected to the same WiFi (same LAN), skip to step 3. Otherwise, create a WiFi hotspot on your Android:\n\n\n\n*Connect your laptop to this WiFi network.\n\n\n*Open ES File Explorer and open left-side menu.\n\n\n*Go to Network -> Remote Manager\n\n\n*Turn on the FTP Server and note down the IP:port address\n\n \n\n*Open Nautilus file explorer on Ubuntu. In connect to URL, type your phone's FTP server URL (from the previous step) and click on Connect\n\n\n*If you need, You can set user name and password in ES File Explorer. By default, It will be public (anonymous). \n\n\n*In your PC, click on Connect. You can use the username and password that you set in ES File Explorer and connect as registered user.\n\n\n*Now the internal memory of your phone is mounted. You can copy new files, remove files, do anything.\n\nIf you wish to mount your SD card, you can set that in ES File Explorer settings.\n\nA: I've been looking for a solution to run SHAREit on Ubuntu without success, here's what I figured what is the most hassle-free approach, though it requires a Windows License of some sort:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Virtualbox on your Ubuntu box if you haven't already\n\n*Install a Windows from XP and up\n\n*Install SHAREit on Windows\n\n*Configure your local SHAREit folder on the Windows guest as a shared one with the host, if you need to access the files on your Ubuntu-box\n\n\nHope it helps!\n\nA: You can now send any files from your phone with ShareIt app to linux without any setup. ShareIt has got a feature \"New Way of Connect to PC\" which directly uses hotspot of the mobile to send file to PC.\nTo use it: Open ShareIt app -> Scroll Down to above option and follow the instructions.\nBasically, at the receiving end, you need to connect to the host WiFi hotspot and navigate to a URL using a simple browser to download things.

Would like to know what scheduling mechanisms is employed in 15.04, time-sharing or real-time, I'm pretty sure its FIFO, Round Robin, SJF?  \nP.S: New to Linux\n\nA: Process scheduler \nA process scheduler handles CPU resource allocation for executing processes, and aims to maximize overall CPU utilization while also maximizing interactive performance.\nSince kernel 2.6.23 (that would be as of Hardy 8.04 LTS) Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) based on \"Rotating Staircase Deadline\". Overview from kernel.org:\n\nCFS stands for \"Completely Fair Scheduler,\" and is the new \"desktop\" process\n  scheduler implemented by Ingo Molnar and merged in Linux 2.6.23.  It is the\n  replacement for the previous vanilla scheduler's SCHED_OTHER interactivity\n  code.\n80% of CFS's design can be summed up in a single sentence: CFS basically models\n  an \"ideal, precise multi-tasking CPU\" on real hardware.\n\"Ideal multi-tasking CPU\" is a (non-existent  :-)) CPU that has 100% physical\n  power and which can run each task at precise equal speed, in parallel, each at\n  1/nr_running speed.  For example: if there are 2 tasks running, then it runs\n  each at 50% physical power --- i.e., actually in parallel.\nOn real hardware, we can run only a single task at once, so we have to\n  introduce the concept of \"virtual runtime.\"  The virtual runtime of a task\n  specifies when its next timeslice would start execution on the ideal\n  multi-tasking CPU described above.  In practice, the virtual runtime of a task\n  is its actual runtime normalized to the total number of running tasks.\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel 2.4: O(n) scheduler; there is no Ubuntu release with that kernel.\n\n*Kernel 2.6.0 to 2.6.22: O(1) scheduler.

You may find the Linux Terminal Server Project (LSTP) a good place to start.\n\nA: It may be that you are thinking of multi-tiered architecture.

Anti-virus' do it, so I believe there should be a way.\n\nA: Not as advanced as terdon, but this will do:\nSave the following code, in a folder where all your code resides in, as finda.sh, or any other name as you like:\nfor file in *.*; do\n    if ( 7z l -slt \"$file\"> /tmp/$file.log); then\n       echo $file:; cat /tmp/$file.log | grep -iE 'Path*'> $file.log && cat $file.log\n    fi\ndone\n\nThen in a dir were all of your archives are in, run it and this is the output:\n./finda.sh \none.7z:\nPath = one/abradabra.png\nPath = one/birb.png\nthree.rar:\nPath = three/blah.png\nPath = three/qwa0g.jpg\ntwo.zip:\nPath = two/whut.png\n\n\nA: The simplest approach would be to list the contents of the archive and look for files of the relevant extension. For example, with a zip file:\n$ zip -sf foo.zip | grep -iE '\\.png$|\\.jpg$'\n  file1.jpg\n  file1.png\n  file2.jpg\n  file2.png\n\nThe -sf option tells zip to list the files contained in an archive. Then, the grep will look for a .png or .jpg that are at the end of the line ($). The -E enables extended regular expressions, so we can use | as OR and the -i makes the matching case insensitive. \nHowever, each archive tool has a different command to list the contents. I've written a script that can deal with most of the more popular ones. If you save that script as list_compressed.sh, you could then run:\nlist_compressed.sh | grep -iE '\\.png$|\\.jpg$|\\.jpeg$|\\.gif$|\\.tif$|\\.tiff$'\n\nThat would show you the most common image types. Note that this approach assumes that the file type can be determined by the file's extension. It will not find image files that don't have an extension and it will not recognize files with the wrong extension. There is no way to deal with that without actually extracting the files from the archive and running file on each of them.    \n\nIf you want to find all archives that contain image files on your hard drive, combine the above with find:\nfind / -name '*.gz' -o -name '*.tgz' -o -name '*.zip' -print0 |\n    while IFS= read -r -d '' arch; do    \n        list_compressed.sh \"$arch\" | \n            grep -qiE '\\.png$|\\.jpg$|\\.jpeg$|\\.gif$|\\.tif$|\\.tiff$' &&\n                echo \"$arch contains image(s)\"\n    done\n\nThe find command will search for all .gz, .tgz or .zip files (you can add as many extensions as you like), those are then passed through my script. The -q suppresses grep's normal output, nothing will be printed. The && echo will print the archive's name only if the grep was successful. \n", "Q: The $PATH added to .bash_profile is not working after reboot I am new to Ubuntu!\nAnd I am trying to setup manually Maven by adding Maven directory into $PATH.

Please Read the rest and find your solution:\nQuoted from http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html:\n\nWhen you login (type username and password) via console, either\n  sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed\n  to configure your shell before the initial command prompt. \nBut, if\n  you’ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window\n  (xterm) inside Gnome or KDE, then .bashrc is executed before the\n  window command prompt. .bashrc is also run when you start a new bash\n  instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.\n\nSo as I suppose you logged in and use the terminal from inside then you should use the .bashrc instead. run this command:\necho 'export PATH=/opt/devel/tools/apache-maven-3.3.3/bin:$PATH' >>~/.bashrc\n\nThen source it:\nsource .bashrc\n\nFor more information please read this\nIf you want your variables to be used in .bash_profile also you can do this trick. Add all of your variables in .bashrc then source it from .bash_profile. Add this to your bash_profile:\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n   source ~/.bashrc\nfi\n\nNow when you login to your system whenever it's from a console or GUI you'll get your environment.\n\nA: You can add your PATH to ~/.profile\n~./bash_profile does not affect terminal emulators, like gnome-terminal, that are started after you log into system. \nAs an option you can setup PATH in /etc/environment globally.\n\nA: Maythux is correct, the variable was declared local, but for it to be seen as a global variable by the system it would have to be exported.\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then \n    . ~/.bashrc \nfi \n\nAlso works in .bash_profile to source $HOME/.bashrc \n", "Q: How long do HWE kernels maintain/support in Ubuntu?

I have, say, 2000 directories that I need to run a specific program in. Due to program limitations, it cannot simply write 'Output1', 'Output2', 'Output3', etc. It has to write 'Output' as it's output file and will overwrite any other file named 'Output', hence the need for a directory for each unique instance of the program. What i need is something to this effect\nWith s being the prefix for the directory. I. E., s0001, s0002....s2000 being the directory names. \ncd s(n)\nls\ncd s(n+1)\n\nand having this looping command stop after \ncd s2000\n\n. I was trying to make it work by an \nif 'cd s(n+1)' = 'cd s(2001)' then echo DONE\n\nstring, but to no avail. \nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: The details depend on your setup. If the parent directory only contains the child directories s0001 to s2000, all you need is to iterate over them and launch the program in each:\nfor d in s*; do\n  cd \"$dir\" && run_program; cd ../;\ndone\n\nThat will move into each dir and lauch run_program. Once that is finished, it moves back. \nIf you need to specify a range of dirs, use this instead:\nfor dir in s{0001..2000}; do\n    cd \"$dir\" && run_program; cd ../\ndone\n\nFinally, if you want to launch all processes simultaneously (not that this might bring your computer to its knees), use &:\nfor dir in s{0001..2000}; do\n    cd \"$dir\" && run_program & cd ../\ndone\n\n\nOlder versions of bash don't expand {001..002} as 001 002 but as 1 2 instead. If your bash doesn't support this, use this approach instead:\nseq 1 2000 | while read i; do \n   dir=$(printf '%0.4d\\n' \"$i\")\n   cd s\"$dir\" && run_program; cd ../;\ndone\n\nThe trick is to generate the numbers between 1 and 2000 using seq and then use printf to add leading 0s as needed. \n\nA: Here's a bash script. Feel free to adapt it to suit your needs.\n#!/bin/bash\n#set -x\nBASEDIR=/home/xieerqi\n\nfind \"$BASEDIR\" -type d -name \"s[[:digit:]][[:digit:]][[:digit:]][[:digit:]]\" -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' folder; do\n        echo \"$folder\"\n        cd \"$folder\"\n        echo \"TEST\" | tee filez{1,2,3}\ndone\n\n\nA: you can try this python script \nimport os\ndef main():\n    a = 100\n    while a>1:\n        os.chdir(os.path.expanduser(\"~/s000\"+a))\n        do your work here\n        a = a-1\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nwhere the while loop changes to the directory until it is equal to 1. and you can change the value of a according to your wish and at \"do your work here\", write what you want to do.\n\nA: The program always writes Output, but you don't have to leave it that way. If the program's settings are controlled from the command line, you can simply run the program and rename the output as soon as it finishes:\nfor dirname in `ls -d s*`\ndo\n    myprogram \"$dirname\"\n    mv Output Output-\"$dirname\"\ndone\n\nOf course I don't know what parameter arguments your program accepts, because you don't say. If it actually reads from lots of files, it make still make sense to have separate directories. But \"the output name is fixed\" is in itself no reason to go to all this trouble.\nPS. Don't use parentheses in your filenames. They have special meaning to the shell and confuse your scripts unless you know how to deal with them.\n", "Q: How to start X application from SSH I've tried to search this topic in google, but without any significant results.\nI need to start some GUI app from terminal, but I don't care what this app is showing me.

An attacker may then\n        be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Check /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server side:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nfor the lines below:\nX11Forwarding yes\nX11UseLocalhost no\n\nRestart the ssh srever, if you have made changes:\nsudo service ssh restart\n\n\n*Check /etc/ssh/ssh_config on the client side:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config\n\nfor the lines below\nForwardX11 yes\nForwardX11Trusted yes\n\n\nA: You just need to run export DISPLAY=:id# in your ssh session and programs run will run on the remote display. A quick example:\nmaythux@maythuxPC:~$ ssh testSSH@myServer\nmaythux@maythuxPC:~$ export DISPLAY=:0\nmaythux@maythuxPC:~$ gedit\n\nNow gedit will run on the user named testSSH display\nYou can shorten this all down into single command:\nssh testSSH@myServer \"DISPLAY=:0 nohup gedit\"\n\n", "Q: Properly backup OS/Boot partition I have two drives in a media server that two different sizes, so I can't run raid on it. However I would like to backup my OS partition so that if Drive 1 fails I can just swap them, update grub/boot partition and keep going without an OS re-install after updating FSTab and grub conf.\nAs you can see by this image I have the secondary drives OS partition mounted at /bakroot. I also have home on the secondary mounted at /home2 and once a day I rsync home to that dir to back it up also.\n\nWhat would be the easiest and best way to keep an OS backup on the secondary drive for this purpose? I've thought of just rsync but I've done it in the past and I know that a lot of files are skipped since they are in use.\nI would like to do it daily, so I don't think that a partition clone will work, unless I can make it do that at boot time or shutdown time without messing up the flow.\n\nA: I have found a good rSync line for the most part using various posts from around the net to come up with a good copy format. This is what I have ended up using:\nsudo rsync -av --exclude=/dev/* --exclude=/lost+found/* --exclude=/mnt/* --exclude=/home/ --exclude=/media/* --exclude=/bakroot/ --exclude=/proc/* --exclude=/sys/* --exclude=/tmp/* --exclude=/var/run/* --exclude=/var/lock/* --exclude=/var/cache/apt/archives/* / /bakroot/\n\nI excluded /home because I already have that backing up to another partition somewhere else.\nThen to restore I just switch out drives and re-install grub using these commands:\n1. Boot with any live CD\n2. Get a root shell and make a folder (mkdir ubuntu)\n3. mount the root (/) partition of ubuntu (e.g. mount /dev/hdb ubuntu if you have two disks)\n4. chroot the mounted partition (chroot ubuntu)\n5. grub-install /dev/hda [1]\n5. Exit the shell\n6. Reboot\n\nSo for the time this seems to work.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Touch on Nexus 7 (2012) now that it is no longer supported I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my Nexus 7 (2012) Tablet, however, it appears that this tablet is no longer included in the official dev releases. I'm about half way through following the Porting to a New Device Guide and I'm just starting to realize how in-depth this project is about to become, so I was wondering if there was a way to find and install the last devel release for grouper.\nThis is the result that I got while following the install guide for Ubuntu Touch:\n$ ubuntu-device-flash touch --channel=stable --device grouper --bootstrap\n\n2015/06/08 12:48:59 Device is |grouper|\nDevice grouper not found on server https://system-image.ubuntu.com channel stable\n\nI also tried this with devel as well. It makes sense that a uTouch build for Grouper is not in either of these channels, as it is no longer officially supported.\nAs I'm not against taking the time to learn how to do this properly, if there is not a way to access a build for grouper, does anyone have some good articles to read or advice from their attempts at doing these sorts of things? This will be my first major foray into development or trying something like this.\n\nA: Since yesterday I have on my Nexus 7 2012 desktop Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, so I think steps for reproduce this on Ubuntu Touch can be similar (or you can try desktop version).\nSo everything you doing on your own risk. :-)\nMy steps was in short this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flash Ubuntu 13.04 via Fastboot (commands in previous answer)\n\n*Edit file with repositories at /etc/apt/sources.list based on this examples (I choose Trusty because it is next LTS after 13.04 and I doesn't expect any problems)\ndeb http://ports.ubuntu.com/ trusty main restricted\ndeb-src http://ports.ubuntu.com/ trusty-security main restricted\n\n*Make apt-get update and apt-get upgrade\n\n*Optional: Install SSH server with apt-get install ssh\n\n*Restart tablet and enjoy latest LTS version of Ubuntu :-)\nSource: my today blogpost (in Czech)\n\nA: Step One: Download Everything\nFirst, grab the latest Raring daily build files for the 2012 Nexus 7:\nubuntu-13.04-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+nexus7.bootimg\nubuntu-13.04-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+nexus7.img.gz\n(found here: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/raring/)\nNext, grab the tools required to install these build files to your device:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your computer, press Ctrl+Alt+T to start a terminal.\n\n*Add the Ubuntu SDK Release PPA: \n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa\n\n*Update your system to use the latest packages:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n*Install the ubuntu-device-flash package:\n$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-device-flash\n(found here: https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/phone/devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices/)\nStep Two: Unlock Your Device\nThe 2012 Nexus 7 ships with a locked bootloader meaning you must unlock it to flash different images to the device. Fortunately, this is a trivial process, and you only need to do it once.\n(Warning: Unlocking the bootloader erases all data and resets the device to factory defaults. If you would rather not lose all of your precious cat pictures, back them up to your computer!)\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your 2012 Nexus 7 into the Android boot loader. To do this, first power down the device in the normal fashion (hold down the power button, then select power off and wait a few seconds). From the off state, hold the volume down button and press the power button. Continue holding the volume down and power buttons until you see the boot loader UI.\n\n*Using a micro-USB cable (the one you use for charging should be fine), plug your device into any computer running Ubuntu. The device now displays the boot loader GUI, which looks like this:\n\n\n\n*Verify fastboot lists the device. In a terminal on Ubuntu, run:\n$ sudo fastboot devices\n\n*Start the bootloader unlock process:\n$ sudo fastboot oem unlock\n\n*Your device should now prompt you to unlock the bootloader. Follow the on-screen directions to continue. Your screen should now look like this:\n\n\n\n*Complete the process by rebooting:\n$ sudo fastboot reboot-bootloader\nWhen the device reboots back into the bootloader (fastboot mode), you should see \"LOCK STATE - UNLOCKED\" in small red print. At this point your device is now unlocked.\n(from here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Installation)\nStep Three: Install Everything\n\n\n*\n\n*Gunzip the *.img.gz file downloaded in Step One to extract the .raw file inside.\n\n*Verify once more that your device is connected via micro-USB and that fastboot lists the device by running the following in terminal:\n$ sudo fastboot devices\n(If your device is not listed, ensure that the device is turned on and booted to the bootloader.)\n\n\n*Issue the following series of commands:\n$sudo fastboot erase boot\n$sudo fastboot erase userdata\n$sudo fastboot flash boot /path/to/*.bootimg\n$sudo fastboot flash userdata /path/to/unzipped/*.raw\n$sudo fastboot reboot\nStep Four: Use Your Device\nIf everything went right, you should now have Ubuntu Desktop running on your 2012 Nexus 7! The installer will likely be buggy, but very familiar. Beware, of course, that this version of Ubuntu is no longer supported by Canonical, and you may have some difficulty finding and using the latest applications on your device. Good luck, and have fun with your newish oldish Ubuntu tablet!\n\nA: You can use the manual installation instructions from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Installation - the location of the files is no longer valid, but the files are still available here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/raring/release/\nThe instructions boil down to these commands:\nfastboot erase boot\nfastboot erase userdata\nfastboot flash boot /path/to/*.bootimg\nfastboot flash userdata /path/to/*.img\n\nHowever there seem to be other options for getting a \"real\" Linux on the Nexus 7 (2012) which are listed here https://github.com/Tasssadar/multirom/wiki/Grouper-Native-Desktop-Linux\nPlease also note that Nexus 7 (2013), Nexus 4 and Nexus 10 are supported by Ubuntu Touch, see https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/start/ubuntu-for-devices/devices/\n", "Q: Is there a way to autostart CPULIMIT in order to reduce excessive CPU consumption tracker-miner-f, tracker-store, tracker-extract and dropbox processes are killing my CPU, they make it run at over 100%, overheating my laptop.\nI have installed CPULIMIT and it works great restricting these processes, however, I cannot get it to autostart. \nI have followed this but it does not work, the daemon starts but I think there is an error in the creation of the script and it does not actually limit any processes. \nIs there a way to reduce cpu usage without having to manually do it through terminal every time I start a new session?\nUbuntu 14.04\nA script I have found below, only partly runs and does not detect the PID correctly. \nIf someone has better knowledge than me, could you check the line:\nNEW_PIDS_COMMAND=\"top -b -n1 -c | grep -E '$BLACK_PROCESSES_LIST' | gawk '\\$9>CPU_LIMIT {print \\$1}' CPU_LIMIT=$CPU_LIMIT\"\n\nIs this correct?\n#!/bin/bash\n# ==============================================================\n# CPU limit daemon - set PID's max. percentage CPU consumptions\n# ==============================================================\n\n# Variables\nCPU_LIMIT=40        # Maximum percentage CPU consumption by each PID\nDAEMON_INTERVAL=3   # Daemon check interval in seconds\nBLACK_PROCESSES_LIST=\"dropbox\" # Limit only processes defined in this variable.

At the moment it is either one or all ... Thanks\n\nA: I realize this thread is a bit old; however, there is a much easier way to accomplish your stated goal.  Using the processes and limits you seem to desire, you can simply create a shell script such as:  \n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Set this variable to the number of cores in your processor.  This example is for an 8-core CPU.  The reason that the number of cores is important is that you need to take it into consideration when setting cpulimit's -l option.  This is explained on the cpulimit project page (see http://cpulimit.sourceforge.net/):  \"If your machine has one processor you can limit the percentage from 0% to 100%, which means that if you set for example 50%, your process cannot use more than 500 ms of cpu time for each second. But if your machine has four processors, percentage may vary from 0% to 400%, so setting the limit to 200% means to use no more than half of the available power.\"\n\nNUM_CPU_CORES=8 #Change this number to reflect the number of cores in your processor.\n\ncpulimit -e \"dropbox\" -l $((50 * $NUM_CPU_CORES))& #Limit \"dropbox\" process to 50% CPU usage.\ncpulimit -e \"tracker-miner-f\" -l $((50 * $NUM_CPU_CORES))& #Limit \"tracker-miner-f\" process to 50% CPU usage.\ncpulimit -e \"tracker-store\" -l $((50 * $NUM_CPU_CORES))& #Limit \"tracker-store\" process to 50% CPU usage.\ncpulimit -e \"tracker-extract\" -l $((50 * $NUM_CPU_CORES))& #Limit \"tracker-extract\" process to 50% CPU usage.\ncpulimit -e \"chrome\" -l $((40 * $NUM_CPU_CORES))& #Limit \"chrome\" process to 40% CPU usage.\n\nMake the above script executable and set it to auto-run as you did with your other scripts (get rid of the other scripts).  In effect, cpulimit will stay in the background and watch for the specified processes and, as soon as one is started, cpulimit will take control and effect its specified limit.  When a specified process dies or is killed, cpulimit will watch for it to become active again, and the process repeats.\n\nA: This is what I have done to resolve my issue:\nsudo apt-get install cpulimit ; sudo apt-get install gawk ; sudo apt-get install top\n\nThen I altered a script to suit:\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # CPU limit of a process\n    #\n    # Variables\n    # NOTE: If your machine has one processor you can limit the percentage from 0% to 100%, which means that if you set for example 50%, your process cannot use more than 500 ms of cpu time for each second.

I use Ubuntu at work for software development. What always bothers me about Ubuntu is the fonts - I really like the crisp fonts used all over Windows (the program bar, headers, etc.) and compared to them, the Ubuntu fonts seem bulky and weird. \nIn the past, I had several Ubuntu installations on multiple devices, but I could never seem to configure the fonts to my satisfaction. Even the results I did get cost me hours and hours of reading online and configuring fonts in obscure menus and files. I know it probably sounds silly, but this is currently the main reason I don't install Ubuntu on my laptop right now.\nIs there a package, script or window manager for Ubuntu that set up fonts in a way that is similar to Windows, without too much hassle of a configuration?\n\nA: Ubuntu also uses the ttf format.

Simply install it:\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nAnd configure them in there.\n\nA: I would suggest this article on WEB UPD8: Better Font Rendering In Linux With Infinality\n\nInfinality is a set of Freetype patches that try to provide an improved font rendering for Linux and also, to allow easy\n  customization so the users can adjust the settings to their taste.\n  Using it, you can easily set the font style to emulate OSX, OSX2,\n  Windows 98, WIndows XP or Windows 7 or you can use the \"Linux\" or \"Infinality\" (default) styles.\nThis is just an example (left the \"Linux\" style, right the default\n  Ubuntu config).\n\nFreetype with the Infinality patches can be installed in Ubuntu by\n  using a PPA. To add the PPA and install the required packages in\n  Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 14.10 or 15.04 use the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:no1wantdthisname/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install fontconfig-infinality\n\nOnce installed, log out and log back in.\nOnce you install Infinality, it's time to configure it. To set the\n  style you want to use, run the following command:\nsudo bash /etc/fonts/infinality/infctl.sh setstyle\n\nAnd select the style you want to use. Available options are: debug,\n  infinality, linux, osx, osx2, win7, win98 and winxp (I recommend using\n  the \"linux\" style, obviously, but you can try any style, then remember\n  to log out and log back in - you can easily select a different style\n  later on by using the same command). To use the Windows or OSX style\n  you'll also need to use the Windows or OSX fonts.\nOptional: next, open /etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh with a text\n  editor as root - I'll use Gedit below:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh\n\nAnd in this file, search for USE_STYLE (it should be\n  USE_STYLE=\"DEFAULT\" by default) and change it to one of the following\n  styles (I recommend using \"UBUNTU\" here but you should also try the\n  default to see which one you like better): \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*DEFAULT - A compromise that should please most people;\n  \n*OSX - Simulate OSX rendering;\n  \n*IPAD - Simulate iPad rendering;\n  \n*UBUNTU - Simulate Ubuntu rendering;\n  \n*LINUX - Generic \"Linux\" style - no snapping or certain other tweaks;\n  \n*WINDOWS - Simulate Windows rendering;\n  \n*WINDOWS7 - Simulate Windows rendering with normal glyphs;\n  \n*WINDOWS7LIGHT- Simulate Windows 7 rendering with lighter glyphs;\n  \n*WINDOWS - Simulate Windows rendering;\n  \n*VANILLA - Just subpixel hinting;\n  \n*CUSTOM - Your own choice;\n  \n*Infinality styles:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*CLASSIC - Infinality rendering circa 2010. No snapping;\n  \n*NUDGE - CLASSIC with lightly stem snapping and tweaks;\n  \n*PUSH - CLASSIC with medium stem snapping and tweaks;\n  \n*SHOVE - Full stem snapping and tweaks without sharpening;\n  \n*SHARPENED - Full stem snapping, tweaks, and Windows-style sharpening;\n  \n*INFINALITY - Settings used by the Infinality developer;\n  \n*DISABLED - Act as though running without the extra infinality enhancements (just subpixel hinting).\n  \n  \n\n\nA: You can find most fonts in web.

Each machine is a CORE I7, 2TB of data storage and 16GB of Memory. Machine 1 is equiped with 2 NICs, 1 connecting it with a public IP and the 2nd connecting it with a D-ink switch. The remaining 7 have single NICs and are connected to the same switch. My mission is to setup a cloud on the provided machines.\nMy initial mission is to setup 1 controller node and 1 compute node. I've gone through several tutorials. I cant figure out where to start. I've seen the tutorial where after cloud installation we select  single machine. However, that installs most of the tools and features on a single machine.\nI've seen the Openstack Installation Guide for Ubuntu 14.04 Juno released on 10th May this year. Went through the Nova architecture. But that setup is without a switch and with multiple NICs on multiple machines.\nI've read that The landscape autopilot option requires MAAS and I believe Juju as well. The second option (the one with MAAS), I couldnt figure out what that was all about.\nI'm kind of stuck here trying to figure out what my starting step would be. Can anyone please help and guide me what to do. Anyone who can guide me where I should start and what I should follow?\n\nA: rmustakos is correct and giving good advice, thank you!\nFrom my perspective since you have 8 nodes, MAAS is worthwhile. You will need one node for MAAS, and on that node you can create some VMs for the Juju bootstrap node, leaving 7 nodes for cloud or other projects.\nYou will need to add some network cards, it is required to have some nodes with multiple disks and some with multiple NICs.\nThe main question I would have for you is which mechanism you will use for power control. Do the nodes have IPMI?\n", "Q: Why I can't write a file in /tmp/ even when it is root:root and has \"t\" flag? I am using the postgres user to execute some special commands. For that, I am trying the following:\n$ sudo su - postgres  \npostgres$ ls -l /tmp\ndrwxrwxrwt  13 root root  4096 jun  8 12:20 tmp  \n\nPGPASSWORD=mypasswordhere time pg_dump --username=postgres --no-password -f /tmp/myfilehere.sql mydatabasehere\npg_dump: [archiver] could not open output file \"/tmp/myfilehere.sql\": Permiso denegado  \nCommand exited with non-zero status 1  \n0.25user 0.06system 0:02.04elapsed 15%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 58064maxresident)k  \n0inputs+0outputs (0major+5110minor)pagefaults 0swaps\n\nQuestion: Why can't I write in /tmp with user postgres? Noticing the sticky flag is set on /tmp.\n\nA: The sticky bit will prevent any user other than the owner of file (and owner of directory and root) to remove/rename any file inside the directory containing sticky bit. If any user does not have permission to write then he would not be able to create any file in /tmp or any other directory having sticky bit set, same goes for read and execute operations.\nIn your case if postgres has sufficient permission to read/write/execute files in /tmp then he can do that otherwise you need to set the appropriate permissions manually.\nExample :\n\ndrwxrwxrwt   7 root   root    4096 Jun  9 00:41 tmp\n\n$ sudo chmod o-rwx /tmp\n\ndrwxrwx--T   7 root   root    4096 Jun  9 00:41 tmp\n\n$ touch /tmp/foo.txt\ntouch: cannot touch ‘/tmp/foo.txt’: Permission denied\n\n$ sudo chmod o+rwx /tmp\n\n$ touch /tmp/foo.txt\n\n$ ls -l /tmp/\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user    0 Jun  9 00:50 foo.txt\n\n", "Q: How to hide imported Python libraries? I am a beginning coder in Python. This may sound misplaced, but wait up a second. My program depends on a couple of libraries that I have allowed it to use via import. These libraries are now showing up in my home directory as \"PS Documents\". Is there a way to hide them without preventing my Python script from accessing them?\n\nA: That sounds like you used the shell instead of Python to run your Python program. \nMake sure the first line of your Python  program is something like\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nSee Shebang for more about this.\nIf your Python program is run by the shell the shell calls import (part of ImageMagick) for each of your import statements. This program waits for you to click any window and then takes a screenshot of that window and saves it under the name gives as argument, by default as PostScript file.\nFor example\nimport sys\n\nwill wait for you to click on a window and save a screenshot of that window in a PostScript file named sys in the current directory.\nYou can just delete those PostScript files.\n", "Q: System does not boot after setting Display Name for main root partition I tried to make all of my NTFS drives auto-mount.

Ubuntu 14.04 already comes with Intel graphics drivers. Intel develops these drivers in the open and in the upstream kernel and Xorg trees.\nThe system freezing when trying to encode or transcode a movie, is likely due to simply overloading the system. Valley View is Intel Atom, which is their very low power X86 processor line. If you are trying to encode or transcode a movie in very high quality, you are probably running out of memory and hitting swap (if you even have any), probably using up all processing resources to perform the work, and depending on what type of hard drive you have, the disk I/O will bring your system to a crawl.\n", "Q: Add SSH key when only public key authentication is available? This question is more of a general Linux or OpenSSH question than it is specific to Ubuntu but because I'm setting up an Ubuntu server, I'm asking it here.\nThe organization I work for is built on an almost entirely Microsoft infrastructure.  That said, I know enough Linux to be dangerous and I'm setting up an Ubuntu server to run Splunk.  I'm trying to lock down the server and one of the things I would like to do is to use only public key authentication for SSH.\nI know how to configure SSH to do this, but there is a challenge with regards to the various users' public keys and I imagine this challenge isn't unique to my situation.  \nThe trouble is this...  Let us say that another person on the Systems Administration team decides they need to log into this server in order to troubleshoot something.  Since public key authentication is the only SSH authentication mechanism allowed, they can only log in via the console (where it will allow them to enter a password).\nHow can this person get their SSH public key loaded into their authorized_keys file without having to type it out manually after logging via the console?  I imagine this question may have a procedural answer that is perfectly valid.  If that is the case, please feel free to suggest a procedure that would be a valid solution to this problem as well.\nThanks in advance!\nIn case it matters, I'm also using PowerBroker Identity Services (PBIS) Open in order to leverage the ability to use Active Directory domain accounts on the server.  If you sign in using a new (and authorized) account on a Linux server running PBIS Open, it automatically creates a profile for that person.  Active Directory accounts do not need to be pre-created on the Linux server running PBIS Open before they can log in.\n\nA: Thanks for the feedback. I will list the proposed (and viable) solutions: \n\n\n*\n\n*use the Hyper-V console instead of the VMM console to \"type\" the key automatically as if pasting\n\n*plug a USB drive into the Cisco UCS chassis and set up USB passthrough\n\n*have another person who can already log in handle the key for the new user\n\n*or temporarily allow password authentication so the new user can set up their key and then disable it again.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 resolution problem I have some problem with resolution.

Even if I snoozed an event reminder it would pop up each time I opened Tbird regardless of how long I chose to snooze it. Also reminders for events are not popping up though they are supposed to when opening TBird on the same day of the event. There is a delay for some reason. I'll open T-Bird in the morning and if an event is due to remind me it may not do so until sometime later. In other words I want my events to pop up when I open T-Bird not later. So if say an event is due tomorrow I want the reminder to pop up when I open T-Bird first thing in the morning. I'm not getting the behavior I desire. This is how Lightning used to behave when I first started using it a few years back.   \nI'm hoping there is a fix or some way I can get Lightning to behave this way again. I haven't played with any setting in the config manager.\nI've been ignoring this annoyance for probably close to two or three years.

When I connected to the wifi in my house it usually worked at first, but every day it would stop working. Sometimes it would disconnect and refuse to reconnect, while at other times it would still show the icon as if it was connected, but it would not load any pages or download anything.\nI googled and saw a few people commenting that lubuntu often comes with network problems, so I cleared the harddisk and did a fresh install of Xubuntu 14.04.2 instead hoping that this might solve the problems...\nThe current situation is that I can connect to the wifi network without a problem and usually I can use it for a while until suddenly no pages will load and any downloads will stop while the network manager still appears to be connected. When it stops working rebooting the computer or reconnecting to the network does not help, and the connection is almost always gone untill i try again the next day.\nThere are several laptops, tablets and smartphones in this house that all seem to connect without problems.

I had to allocate space for Ubuntu, and I did so using a cute little slider.\nI made my Ubuntu partition a bit too big (Windows doesn't have much space left right now) so I want to expand Windows and shrink Ubuntu.\nIs there any idiot-proof way to do this (preferably by getting the slider back)? GParted gave me tons of scary warnings, and I remember how there were no such hassles when I was resizing partitions during my initial Ubuntu install.\nHere is a GParted screenshot, if it helps.\nThank you!\n\nA: Given your current state, and assuming the amount of free space is what you want to add to Windows, you must:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move your Ubuntu partition (/dev/sda5) to the right.\n\n*Shrink your extended partition (/dev/sda4) to its smallest possible size. (You must shrink it from its left side.)\n\n*Grow your Windows partition (/dev/sda2) to fill the free space.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I know of no tool that lets you resize an already-installed system in as simple a way as the installer did. Also, these operations are not risk-free. Moving the Ubuntu partition is particularly risky, since a lot of data structures will have to be re-written. You might want to grow the Windows partition using Windows tools rather than GParted, since GParted relies on a reverse-engineered understanding of NTFS and might mess things up. To minimize the risks, back up all your important personal files before you begin.\nAn alternative that's much safer is to create a new partition in the free space. Make it FAT or NTFS and Windows will be able to use it. This is likely to be less convenient, but it has some other advantages. For instance, if you use that new partition to store all your personal files you might want to access from either OS, you can configure Ubuntu to not access the main Windows partition at all. This reduces risks to that partition, since it then becomes much less likely that an errant command in Ubuntu will wipe out Windows, or that a driver bug will do the same. OTOH, the configuration that you'll get from this will be less efficient, since when you're in Windows, the disk's head will have to seek over the Ubuntu partition when accessing both the original Windows partition and your new partition. The sizes also might not be optimal. Nonetheless, it's worth considering this approach. Given your unfamiliarity with the tools, I'd say it's the preferable solution.\n", "Q: How to install VLC 2.2.1 in Ubuntu 15.04 I want to install VLC 2.2.1 which is the current stable version. \nI've followed the instructions from How to update VLC to the latest version? but it only installs VLC 2.2.0 which is the same version than the one from the Ubuntu Software Center :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:videolan/stable-daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\n\nA: You can achive this with n-muench vlc ppa but do read all the warnings and notations from the PPA, as you'll be taking any risk for any damages at your own risk.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:n-muench/vlc\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThis will upgrade your installed vlc version to 2.2.1 if you don't have any installed then after the above commands run:\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\n", "Q: APM best settings I mean this one:\n\nWhat's the best setting for this?

Where is the large file stored, if not in RAM?\n\nA: The most likely explanation is just that conky is not counting that memory as \"used\" memory.\nWhat is \"used\" and what is \"available\" memory is not a simple black and white in Linux or any modern OS.  For example, the system cache (including the hard disk cache) is \"used\" in the sense that memory is allocated to it, but is \"free\" in the sense that it's only taking up otherwise available RAM, and will naturally shrink as less RAM becomes available to it.\ntmpfs is a virtual filesystem which behaves a little like system cache in many respects, in that it has files mapped in RAM taking up memory that would otherwise be \"free\", except they aren't duplicates of files that also exist on permanent disk-based storage.  With tmpfs, if there ceases to be enough free RAM to keep them in memory, it will swap those files out to the swap partition instead.\nThus for the same reason it makes sense to sometimes think of cache memory as free, in some respects it also makes sense to think of tmpfs memory as free, because that memory is still available for use by other applications.\n\nA: The following provides info about RAM disk usage at a quick glance, i.e. how much memory is committed to a specific ramdisk.

I'm currently attempting to run a Canon CanoScan LiDE 25. I have tried both XSane and Simple Scan. I've tried running from Terminal with sudo. Scanners are recognized in Simple Scan, but will not scan. For the sake of simplicity I will only focus on the Canon scanner at this time.\nCanon CanoScan LiDE 25 \n\n\n*\n\n*Type: Flatbed\n\n*Scanning Element: CIS (Color Contact Image Sensor)\n\n*Light Source: 3-color (RGB) LED\n\n*Optical Resolution: 1200x2400 dpi\n\n*Selectable Resolution: 25-19200 dpi (ScanGear CS)\n\n*Interface: USB 1.1\n\n*Power Consumptions: In operation: 2.5watts maximum, Stand by:\n1.4watts\n\n\nMy Machine: HP Pavilion g6 \n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: 4x Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz\n\n*Memory: 3937MB (1217MB used)\n\n*OS: Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\n\n*Resolution: 1366x768 pixels\n\n\nI've uploaded a screenshot of the issue (XSane lower right window, Simple Scan on the left with a Terminal window open and showing the scanner is recognized) which you can find linked here via my GDrive.\nIn the research I have done I've heard whispers of permissions issues, USB incompatibility and a \"there is no backend\" issue via this Linux Blog. I have no idea where to go next with this and could use the help.\nThanks very much for looking and any input and/or advice.\n\nA: I use Canon CanoScan LiDE 25 and recently tried to scan again using Simple Scan. While the scanner always works for 32-bit system, it had failed work at all for 64-bit system. I have confirmed these results while running Xubuntu 14.04.\nProof of failed attempts\nIn the following attempts, I connect the scanner to USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports in turns and run lsusb and dmesg | tail commands in Terminal to confirm it is being detected. The output lines have been trimmed to show the relevant ones only.\nAttempt 1. Use USB 3.0 port to connect the scanner (Detect: YES, Scan: FAILED)\n\n$  lsusb\nBus 001 Device 011: ID 04a9:2220 Canon, Inc.

This didn't make much sense to me, so I just tried changing the ports without disabling any USB settings in BIOS/UEFI menu. In both attempts, Simple Scan failed with error as shown in screenshot below.\n\nI estimate 64-bit driver support is still lacking to this answered date. Or, 32-bit device driver must be used to make the scanner work properly. That being said, I even tried to install Simple Scan for 32-bit system on Xubuntu 14.04 64-bit system but failed miserably.\nNow it works (2016-07-06)\nI tested again Canon CanoScan LiDE 25 against Xubuntu 16.04 64-bit live system. I repeated the attempts above and it worked from both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports. No further configuration is required; the scanner works out of box in 16.04 releases.\nAbove all, I didn't manage to figure out why it didn't work in 14.04 64-bit and why now it works for 16.04 64-bit. These LTS releases are already quite different in terms of kernel release, package version, program version, and others.\nTL;DR For 64-bit system, the easiest solution is to use the current release (16.04). Else, the scanner works in 32-bit system of any release that is supported to this date.\n", "Q: Display the current date & time in the window's title Is it currently/technically possible to display the current date & time (ie: digital clock numbers) to the currently active window?

I am able to create hotspot(ad-hoc) and it is visible to other laptops and connects successfully but hotspot is not visible to android devices.\n\nA: Android does not support by default ad-hoc wifi network. For that to work, you need to install some third party app/utility that require most of the time that the android device is rooted.\nSo another option is to create a (software) AP (Access Point) on Ubuntu. But for that you need that your wifi card support it at the driver level. And few card support that.

Access windows from ubuntu I have two OS installed on my PC. Ubuntu and Windows. I need, sometimes, to use windows to open some files but I need to restart my computer to access windows, because I use Ubuntu as my primary OS.\nIs there any option to access the windows installed on my computer with a software, directly from my Ubuntu?\nThank you all!\n\nA: If you want to just access the files stored on the windows part, you can use ntfs-3G to read he ntfs partition\n\nA: First of all, what do you mean when you're saying \"access to Windows\"?\nIf you want to run Win app under linux, you can try to install some virtualisation, like VMWare or Xen, and within Xen you can install Windows - but still - your hardware must be powerful enough.\nIf you really need some app which is not available in Linux - you shouldn't use Linux at all, however there is lot of free software which can be really good replacement of Win applications.\n\nA: If you have powerful hardware, consider using virtualization software such as VirtualBox to run Windows inside Linux, so that you can run Windows applications while you are inside Linux.\n\nA: No absolutely no, but instead you can use some applications that run .exe files from inside Ubuntu, such as wine, playonlinux ....\nThe most known is wine.\nyou can install wine using the command:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nOnce wine is installed you can create a Windows environment inside your Ubuntu so you can install and use some windows app inside.\nHere you can find lits of apps that works with wine.\nAnother Option to use Virtual machines such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xen\n\n*VBox\n\n*Qemu\n\n*VMWare\n\n\nHere you can find a list of available virtual machines for Ubuntu.\n\nA: If your machine is powerful enough you could install something like VMware ESX as main OS, which is only host to other VMs. (I don't know if ESX is free or if you can get something similar for free.) You can then install Ubuntu and Windows next to each other and run both at the same time. This is done all the time in the cloud with AWS and Azure. \nStill you need a tool like Remote Desktop or VNC to access one or the other OS. I don't know how it will work out on a desktop, and I don't think this is a good solution for you, more meant for big companies and cloud hosting. Virtualbox is the way to go. \n\nA: VirtualBox allows to run a Windows OS guest on your Ubuntu host.\nMoreover, it is even possible to boot the windows you have on another partition with virtualbox from witin your Ubuntu host.\nFor that, you need to tell virtualbox to use directly your hard-drive instead of using a virtual hdd VDI.\nThis is a little technical but it works perfectly fine.\nHere is the link to virtualbox manual https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#idp97335088\n\nA: You can access your windows partition from Ubuntu without booting to windows. You simply need to set the attributes to allow it to be shared. You can do this either from windows or from Ubuntu so long as you are the administrator when you do it.\nTake a look for this link.\nI have read that the Xbox One uses two different operating systems at the same time, so that tells me it is possible, but I could not tell you how. Maybe it uses DoubleDos.\nYou could virtualize your windows system so long as it is not the OEM version.\n", "Q: nova-api service shuts down automatically I was trying to configure Nutron on my Network node, and I observed that nova-api service on my controller is stopped.

Is\nthere a way to force Lubuntu into Grub, but have the Grub\nautomatically progress to full boot?\n\n\nA: I installed the nVidia driver and that seems to have fixed the \"will not boot\" issue. \nThus: install the proprietary driver for your graphics card as it may be related to the startup process hanging/dying when it hits the graphics subsystem.\n\nA: I have been having a similar issue.\nWhat I did to fix it was press on escape (several times) once the screen goes into standby.\nNot 100% sure if it'll work for you but it's worth a try right :)\n", "Q: Udevadm trigger is not permitted I have Ubuntu 14.04 installed, yesterday i performed an update, but the update center froze for some reason, when i tried to reboot the pc, i was unable to and i got the following error message: \n\"udevadm trigger is not permitted while udev is unconfigured\"\nI have tried to get in with a live CD, and i tried this command: \nsudo update-initramfs -u -k all\n\n(i have 2 kernels 3.13.0-32-generic and 3.13.0-52-generic i dont know why, i even tried sudo update-initramfs -u -k 3.13.0-32-generic) \nso that did not work.\nthen i tried this: \nsudo mkdir /media/newroot/\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/newroot/\nsudo chroot /media/newroot/\nsudo apt-get update\n\nbut it failed to reach all the links with \nsudo: unable to resolve host ubuntu\n\nIs there anyway to fix or reinstall the kernal or something?\n\nA: The correct steps:\nsudo mkdir /media/newroot/\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/newroot/\nsudo chroot /media/newroot/\ndpkg --configure -a\n\nand then run:\nupdate-initramfs -u -k all\n\n\numount /media/newroot/\n\nThen restart.\n\nsudo: unable to resolve host ubuntu\n\nThis is not a big deal and don't care about this run since you are using live cd and Ubuntu is the default hostname in livecd while you are trying to run from chroot.\nPS: you dont need sudo when you chroot\nThere is a bug here about this case\n", "Q: How to disable shadows for Ubuntu 15.04 for a certain window class? How to disable shadows for Ubuntu 15.04 for a certain window class?\nIn Ubuntu < 15.04, you could disable shadows and window decorations for a specific class of windows, using CCSM.\nFor a specific example: \nI'd like to remove Shadow decorations from Conky windows. (Conky is a desktop monitor system.) In previous versions of Ubuntu, you could use CCSM and choose \"Window decorations -> Decoration windows -> By class\" and selectively remove shadows/decoration from your choice of window class.\nYou can see from the photo, there's shadows around the boxes on the desktop.\n\nAttempting to enable \"window decoration\" plugin in CCSM now interferes with Unity's window decoration.  (Which is, naturally, a disaster. It disables Unity completely.)\n\nHow can I disable shadows for a certain window class in Ubuntu 15.04+?\nThanks!\n\nA: As the dialog suggests, there's a Unity plugin that provides decorations. You can find it in the Desktop section of ccsm.\nIn the Decorations tab, Check Override Theme Settings then set the shadow colors to be 0 percent opaque. No more shadows!\n", "Q: Export chrooted logs from a pbuilder-dist build I'm using pbuilder-dist to test a build against a specific Ubuntu release and architecture.

But last_operation.log lists only the output from the cleaning of the build environment (which is executed after the build failed).\n\nA: Found a way to solve this, so I'll answer my own question. \nThe solution was to use a hook script to pbuilder. The linked article describe it well, but for the sake of completeness, I'll redo the steps here:\nFirst create a directory for you hook scripts:\nsudo mkdir /var/cache/pbuilder/hook.d\n\nThen add this directory to pbuilder's configuration:\necho HOOKDIR=\\\"/var/cache/pbuilder/hook.d\\\" >> ~/.pbuilderrc\n\nCreate a hook script called C10shell with the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\n# invoke shell if build fails.\n\napt-get install -y --force-yes vim less bash\ncd /tmp/buildd/*/debian/..\n/bin/bash < /dev/tty > /dev/tty 2> /dev/tty\n\nSave it to your HOOKDIR, and make it executeable\nsudo chmod a+x /var/cache/pbuilder/hook.d/C10shell\n\nNow, if the build fails, you will be presented with a root shell within the chrooted environment of pbuilder.\n", "Q: Windographer installed with no errors but won't run under wine I have Ubuntu Mate 15.04 and I have successfully installed wine from the .deb package they provide.

Could you please tell us what program it is you are trying to run ?\nIf you really need to run that program then you have always got the choice of using a virtual machine inside your primary os (for you mate 15.04). The easiest way is to download virtual box or do it per command line \nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nYou could also dual boot into Windows. This would be easier to explain per video.

How can I get current date/time in terminal. I mostly start up my system in text(console) mode and need the command to know the current date/time. \n\nA: Although all the answers here are correct, you need to use the date command manually to see the time whenever you want, and the output will mix with normal output of your command. This is mostly ok, but sometime is not practical. \nYou can add the date command to your prompt which will show a (fixed) clock every time the shell is ready for the command, or you can use one of the terminal multiplexer that have a status line. My preferred one (although I admit the oldest one) is GNU screen. \nIn console or in a terminal, say via ssh, if you use screen, among zillions of different things you can do (I used to think about screen as unavoidable for working when I had just a text terminal) you have the option --- which is normally in the default configuration --- of having a clock in the status line: \n \n(The screenshot is on a virtual terminal, but it's the same on a virtual console). \n\nA: Also will output the date and time:\nsudo hwclock\n\nMore detailed:\nman hwclock\n\n\nA: The date command will show you the date and time. \nman date will show you how to control the output to whatever format you need, if you want something other than the standard output.

At the near completion of installation process, installation process gets aborted and it says setup interrupted.\nDoes wine1.6 support Acrobat Professional 8? Please help.\n\nA: 1. WINE WAY\nFirst of all, I would update wine to newer version...but that might not be necessary.\n\n\n*\n\n*You need Windows (at least in VM)\n\n*running copy of Adobe Pro 8 on that copy of windows (That's because there is some bug, which prevents wine to copy files to desired directory and you need to do it manually)\n\n\nYou need to copy a few registry entries from there for Acrobat to work.\n        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> Software -> Adobe\n        Right click on the Adobe folder and select Export, and name this file acrobat.reg.\nIf you did not configure wine already, Run the following to create your own .wine folder.\nwinecfg (make sure to run winecfg from the command line if you make any changes or updates to wine)\nThe Windows regedit export file you just created, \"acrobat.reg\", is a native windows app and has a few Windows based dependencies. You need to use winetricks from the command line to install these. Execute the following (or use GUI, whatever suits you more):\nwinetricks msxml6\nwinetricks gdiplus\nwinetricks gecko\nwinetricks vcrun2005\nwinetricks vcrun2008\nwinetricks msxml3\nwinetricks atmlib\n\nCopy the following files from the Windows installation into the .wine directory on Linux.\nC\\Program Files\\Adobe\\ ----> $HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Adobe\nC\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe ----> $HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Common Files/Adobe\nC\\Documents and Settings\\$USER\\Application Data\\Adobe ----> $HOME/.wine/drive_c/users/$USER/Applications Data/Adobe\nC\\windows\\system32\\odbcint.dll ----> $HOME/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32/odbcint.dll\n\nOnce that's done, copy over your acrobat.reg file from your Windows machine to your home directory and execute the command below.\nwine regedit acrobat.reg\nThat will import the registry entries into the wine registry.\nTo test it out, go to go to Home -> .wine -> drive_c -> Program Files -> Adobe ->Acrobat with your favorite shell and right click on the Acrobat.exe and select \"Open with Wine\".\nThere is also way with patching wine source, so it bypasses that bug with copying problem, but I guess this might be easier!\nI've made version 10 working with similar steps\n\n2. VB SEAMLESS MODE WAY\n\n\n*\n\n*Install VB with extensions (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\n\n*Install Windows on it (I have used Tiny XP rev 11 because it runs on 100 mb of RAM + it's fast and we don't want windows to take more... quick google search should do)\n\n*Install Guest Additions (So we can make shared folder (etc.) work) \n\n*If you are not able to get your resolution higher even after installing Guest Additions try switching between full screen Host + F, seamless mode Host + L and Auto resize Host + G - did the trick for me\n\n*install Adobe Acrobat Pro as you would normally do on Windows\n\n*set windows task bar to auto hide, after that go to Machine -> Settings -> General -> Advanced and check Show Mini Toolbar in Seamless Mode.\n\n*Unmount Guest Additions as it would cause issues, because of what we're going to do (I've tried)\n\n*run your application\n\n*press Host + L to get to seamless mode \n\n*Now we're going to save machine state, not power it off (click X on VB minitoolbar or press Host + Q), that's because it starts with your application opened and in seamless mode by default (just let it switch on the next run and select \"don't show this message again\"), I'm sure that it is possible to start application on VM startup (probably msconfig) with seamless mode, without need of saving machine state, but for me that is good enough. Make sure you unmount Guest Additions before this step as it would make your VM inaccessible (it's fixable, but why bother...)\nNow for the desktop entry (if you have any trouble with it check: Creating a .desktop file for a new application):\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Adobe Acrobat Pro\nExec=VBoxManage startvm \"name-of-your-vm\"\nIcon=path/to/your/desired/icon\nType=Application\nStartupWMClass=VirtualBox\nCategories=Office;\n\nIt probably loads a little slower than via WINE, but this way it's more stable I guess. Plus it can be used for ANY application\nIt will look something like this(you can theme both wine and VM):\n\n\nA: I have installed wine1.7 only.

I am also interested in learning the Launchpad workflow. Could you recommend some book about those topics?\n\nA: There is no \"book\" on Debian Packaging or Ubuntu Packaging that follows all the packaging policies for both, that is up to date, as there are changes frequently enough that you have to read the policies and the guides after they're updated.  There's only the guides for Ubuntu or Debian.  I had been looking for books for some time, but in fact there were none that were 'good' enough to meet what is needed here.\nThe Ubuntu Packaging Guide was modified since I first read it to use bzr and version control systems (i.e. Ubuntu Distributed Development, or UDD) for packaging.  That will be your best resource.\n\nUbuntu: Use the packaging guide link above.  It touches upon using Bazaar (bzr) and version control for packaging in Ubuntu, using the UDD process.\nDebian: The Debian New Maintainers Guide may be a good start point.  This does not use bzr for version controls, since that's an almost Ubuntu-specific thing.\n", "Q: Getting Error while installing error: premature end of casper/vmlinuz.efi.\nunaligned pointer 0xc7923008\nAborted.Press any key to exit._\nWhenever I start installing it gives me this error.I don't know how to remove this error.

I also have multiple Ubuntu workspaces which I navigate with Ctrl+Alt+Arrow keys.\nThe problem is that when the virtual machine window gets focus, it traps the Ctrl+Alt keys (actually it traps all keys, which is technically correct behavior), but then those keys no longer perform my host OS workspace switching.\nI'd like the workspace switch shortcut key to continue working even if my VM is focused. I suppose I wouldn't mind if both OSes receive the Ctrl+Alt+Arrow and process them (though my VM doesn't use these shortcut keys.)\nMy current workaround is to click outside (unfocus) the VM, but I don't want to have to do this.\nThere may be no solution to this, but I thought I'd ask.\n\nA: At present there is no option to customize the capture behavior of host keystrokes in VirtualBox. It is either always \"Auto Capture Keyboard\" or never so. This can be defined in the application preferences from Virtual Box Manager preferences dialog.\nA convenient way to temporarily toggle host keyboard capturing is pressing the Host-key once. By default this is set to RightCtrl but on my system I set it to RightShift as shown below:\n\nIf auto-capture was enabled we can use the host keys until we toggle back. \nIn case we had used AltTab application switcher the guest restores the default keyboard capture state when the guest windows gets focus again.\n", "Q: giblib error on LXterminal I used this command:\nscrot -e 'mv $f ~/Pictures/Screenshots/\n\nI have also created those folders in my directory but i cannot still take a screenshot.

I wanted to increase the volume of an .mp3 file.\nThis is what I did:\nlame --scale 4 src.mp3 dest.mp3\n\nsrc.mp3 was 12.5MB whereas dest.mp3 is 4MB.\nThe audio is much louder, but I'm worried if it lost quality.\n\nA: MP3 uses lossy compression. Just by recompressing it and doing nothing else, you lose data and introduce artefacts. That said, such a drop probably means it's changing bitrate or the sample rate so there's even less data being stored. Or maybe the old compression was rubbish.\nEither way, I wouldn't recompress. Use something like ReplayGain. This is a variable set in the file's tags to say how much louder that track has to be to match its album. You can set it without recompression. The downside is it requires the player to use it.\nSee: Adding ReplayGain tags\n\nA: LAME is an audio compressor, used to create compressed audio files, so it's normally make the size smaller.\nRunning man lame gives:\nNAME\n       lame - create mp3 audio files\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       lame [options] <infile> <outfile>\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       LAME  is  a program which can be used to create compressed audio files.\n\nYou can still having the same quality by specifying the ferquency (-s option) to satisfy your need.\nTake a look for lame options\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Update Fail Error So I'm having an issue with trying to run \"sudo apt-get update\".

I did not use to see them before I created the encrypted user, and when I nevertheless enter the password, it keeps asking me to enter the password or about 10 more times until it eventually stops....\n\nIf I click on the \"Cancel\" button, I see the following error message:\n\nWhat can I do to stop the authentication requirements when I log in?\n\nA: I highly doubt that the encrypted home directory is the culprit since I am also greeted by these happy little password boxes any time I switch TTY's or VT's without having any encryption on my home directory. If I cancel them, nothing really happens except the indicator-sensors package becomes a stale application with sensor readings from before I cancelled the pop-ups.\nDo you by any chance have the package indicator-sensors installed on your system? You can verify it is, or is not, by typing dpkg -s indicator-sensors in a terminal window.\nA possible workaround for this problem is to add the user to a group that has the rights to read the power state. - I have yet to figure out which group this is though, and if it's even advisable.\n\nEdit:\nI have tracked down the issue to the udisks2 package. A quick search led me to this forum. I do not advise to pull this guy/gal's trick on your own machine though. There has to be a cleaner way.\n\nEdit 2:\nI found this Debian bug report, but this is regarding the \"latest\" (Thu, 22 Jan 2015) unstable build. This ArchWiki article might hold a fix, but polkit is not standard on *buntu systems. *Buntu systems do have policykit-1, so it might work with some adjustments.\nI also found this Debian forum thread, which seems to be talking about the same issue.\n\nEdit 3:\nHere is an example of a polkit group called \"storage\". However, this is for VoidLinux. *Buntu does have /etc/polkit-1/ but it does not contain a rules.d directory.\nAll signs point to adding the user to the right group. On Arch systems this group is named \"storage\", but *buntu does not have this group (on my system). You can check if you have this group by typing cut -d: -f1 /etc/group | grep storage in a terminal window. I did find a group called \"disk\" but I would advise against adding yourself to thathttp://askubuntu.com/posts/678230 group.\n\nThe disk device nodes are group accessible to disk so that programs that need access to them will set their group ID to be disk. This group has write access to all the raw disk devices (/dev/hd* and /dev/sd*), so assigning users to group disk is both dangerous and a security risk.\n\n\nEdit 4:\nAfter fiddling around a little, I think I found the solution. You indeed need to create a new group that has authority to mount and read disks. This is done like so:\n\ncd /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/ #this is where your policies are stored\nls -la | grep org.freedesktop #find the correct policy. Should be udisks2.policy\n<your-text-editor-here> <policy-file>\n\nNow you can edit the policy file accordingly. Since I did not have the exact same problem, I cannot post my fix. But here's what I found while applying my fix:\n<action id=\"org.freedesktop.udisks2.ata-check-power\">\n    <description>Check power state</description>\n    <message>Authentication is required to check the power state</message>\n    <defaults>\n        <allow_any>auth_admin</allow_any>\n        <allow_inactive>auth_admin</allow_inactive>\n        <allow_active>yes</allow_active>\n    </defaults>\n</action>\n\nBased on your problem description I would suggest fiddling with this section until the pop-ups stop showing up.\n\nA: Had the same problem today (28th Sep 2015) after an update.

Update #2: I had a great missunderstanding about the -p option, now it's clear to me that it's used to process all the files provided as an argument, but I still don't quite understand why this is needed when reading the input from stdin.\n\nUpdate #1: I've noticed that the -p option is always needed (at least when performing a substitution), even when using the deafult separator (newline character) and when the input file is a single line, and I don't quite understand why dropping the -p option to process a single line (which seems to be something appropriate) breaks everything (i.e. no output).\nFor example, running echo -n 'test' | perl -pe 's/test/newstring/' outputs newstring as expected, but echo -n 'test' | perl -e 's/test/newstring/' outputs nothing.\n\nOriginal question:\nWhy does slurping the whole file reading from stdin in a Perl command (e.g. perl -0777 -e [...]) still needs the -p option to be given in order to actually process the file (e.g. perl -0777 -pe [...])?\nI understand that the -p option places a loop around each line of the command, but why isn't changing (in this case removing) the separator enough for Perl to process the file? Or, why is it necessary, despite the fact that the file is going to be processed only once, to tell Perl to place a loop around each line of the command?\n\nA: The perl --help command states that -p assumes a loop like -n but prints line also, like sed. sed is a stream editor, and is used to manipulate text much like how the -p option works with perl. -p is the only option for perl to print the processed output.  Without the -p option, the processed output cannot be printed. So as it's shown in my example below, if the print doesn't happen, the string is not replaced.\nWARNING: DO NOT REPLACE THE -p WITH -n AS IT WILL BLANK OUT YOUR FILE!\n~$ sudo grep \"CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\" /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nosplash\"\n\n~$ sudo perl -pi -e 's/nosplash/splash/' /etc/default/grub\n\n~$ sudo grep \"CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\" /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"splash\"\n\n~$ sudo perl -i -e 's/splash/nosplash/' /etc/default/grub\n\n~$ sudo grep \"CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\" /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"splash\"\n\n", "Q: What navigation application can I use on Ubuntu phone devices, is it good as Google Map navigation?

When I first installed Ubuntu Studio 14.04 a few months ago, I chose the option for the disk to be encrypted. I have had two issues since then that I believe have to do with it. \nFor a while every time I booted up, my screen went dead after BIOS finished loading, and the only way to get out of that was to press Escape - no other key, only ESC worked. Then boot-up proceeded just fine. \nAfter replacing my graphics driver with one from Nvidia that problem was replaced with the USB keyboard not being loaded when I have to enter the password for the encryption program.

It does have two old drives on it that I have never been able to mount and just left... could that be a factor?\n\nA: This is a common issue (bug report), the kernel driver  module is not loaded as it is on the encripted drive, so you need to add it to the appropriate file.\nBoot Ubuntu using the ps/2 keyboard\nOpen a terminal window, and run \nsudo nano /etc/initramfs-tools/modules\n\nAdd ohci_pci on a new line at the bottom of the file.\nIf you’re using an Apple keyboard, you’ll probably need to add hid_apple and mac_hid.\nIf you’re using a Microsoft keyboard, you’ll need to add hid_microsoft\nIf you’re using a Logitech keyboard hid_logitech and hid_logitech_dj\nOnce you’ve added all of the required modules, press ctrl+X to save and close the file.\nBack in the terminal window, run \nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nNow reboot and your wireless keyboard should work.\n\nA: Sounds like the bios does not know what is to boot into...

This is really confusing when you have a window behind the terminal which shows its title bar in Pantheon's place.\n\n\nIs anyone aware of any workarounds to fix these issues and if they should be reported on Launchpad?\nIf I were to switch to using the Elementary desktop environment then it would likely work better, but Elementary DE is incompatible with 15.04 and I would prefer to carry on using the Pantheon terminal in vanilla Ubuntu if possible.\n\nA: As @xangua pointed out, pantheon-terminal is using the new \"header bars\" client-side decoration component of GTK.

An unofficial workaround for the issue I experienced is to disable client-side decorations for the affected app:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gtk3-nocsd\ngksu nano /usr/share/applications/pantheon-terminal.desktop\n\nEdit your Exec= line to look like below:\nExec=env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/gtk3-nocsd/gtk3-nocsd.so pantheon-terminal\n\nNow the pantheon-terminal header bar is no longer transparent in Unity :)\nEDIT: I now advise against the current version of the gtk-nocsd workaround (0-1+git20140824), as it causes the GUI parts of some programs such as hplip-3.15.6 to segfault when run from the pantheon-terminal. The nocsd authors appear to be working on some fixes for this however: https://github.com/PCMan/gtk3-nocsd/pull/8\n", "Q: goes to installing dropbox when using - sudo dpkg --configure -a I tried running sudo apt-get update and got this error:\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\n\nE: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/\n\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\n\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\nI read the answers already posted for the same error and tried:\nsudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nAfter this it just goes to installing dropbox somehow and doesnt stop or let me use apt to download anything else. Any idea what is going on? Thanks for helping!\n\nA: Usually this happens if your install crashed in the middle of something and you need to finish, or if your trying to run apt twice on the same machine. \nFirst make sure that apt is not running anywhere else on the computer. If it's not then run sudo dpkg --configure -a and let it finish installing what ever it wants. After it's done then you can go back and remove what you don't want. \nFor your question, it sounds like you installed dropbox (or tried to) at some point in the past, and it failed or was interrupted. Now when you run  sudo dpkg --configure -a your telling it to configure everything not configured (i.e. finish what you started). You need to let it finish before you can move on. \n", "Q: How to disable systemd-logind from handling lid close actions?Ubuntu 15.04 I want do disable logind from handling lid close actions, because my MacBookAir uses sometimes 45 seconds to suspend after closing lid. I have diabled this in settings editor in Xubuntu before, and then my MacBook suspended right away with no problems. This has only happen in Ubuntu 15.04. And logind is the problem. I want to know how to disable logind from handling lid close actions in Ubuntu too.\n\nA: You want to look at /etc/systemd/logind.conf. Look for help in the man page of logind.conf\nSpecifically, you want to change HandleLidSwitch to ignore in the above mentionned file. But then when closing the lid, no action will be taken and the laptop will not go to sleep. This might not be what you want.\n", "Q: Issues Installing a Tool Set I am working on a research project that requires me to utilize data from NASA's Fermi Large Area Telescope. NASA provides users with a package of tools to manipulate and utilize the data they'd be encountering but is accompanied with a poor installation guide. \nI have installed these tools(modules) successfully but for some reason they seem to work within one terminal only. If I were to open another terminal and tried to use a module, example: gtselect, it would not recognize the command while the other terminal I originally installed the package on would. \nAlso whenever I close the terminal such as shutting down my computer for the evening the next day I must reinstall the software. (There is no hard-drive protection software on this PC that may be restoring the HDD to a previous state) \nThat all being said I decided to write a bash shell script to do the install for me each time I need to in order to remove the hassle of typing long path names over and over again. For some reason, however, the bash script does not work and the tools I try to use remain unrecognised.  \nHere are the commands that, if I enter manually one at a time in this order, install both packages correctly for me to utilize:\ncd /home/dwoodson/FermiScienceTools/ScienceTools/Ubuntu/BUILD_DIR\n./configure\nexport FERMI_DIR=/home/dwoodson/FermiScienceTools/ScienceTools/Ubuntu\nsource $FERMI_DIR/fermi-init.sh\ncd /home/dwoodson/HEASoft/heasoft-6.16/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-libc2.5/BUILD_DIR\n./configure\nexport HEADAS=/home/dwoodson/HEASoft/heasoft-6.16/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-libc2.5\nsource $HEADAS/headas-init.sh\n\nThese lines were given to me specifically from the NASA installation guide. I did not devise these on my own. \nI put these lines exactly into a bash shell script:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/dwoodson/FermiScienceTools/ScienceTools/Ubuntu/BUILD_DIR\n./configure\nexport FERMI_DIR=/home/dwoodson/FermiScienceTools/ScienceTools/Ubuntu\nsource $FERMI_DIR/fermi-init.sh\ncd /home/dwoodson/HEASoft/heasoft-6.16/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-libc2.5/BUILD_DIR\n./configure\nexport HEADAS=/home/dwoodson/HEASoft/heasoft-6.16/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-libc2.5\nsource $HEADAS/headas-init.sh\n\nOne installs correctly, the other does not. Please let me know if anyone can be of assistance. \nThank you\n\nA: Turns out there is a simple solution, the kind worthy of face palms. I was trying to run the command: \nbash LoadTools.sh \n\nWhere LoadToals is the name of my script. This was causing all the changes that were being made to remain in the child shell and was leaving the parent shell unaffected, meaning all changes made by the configure files were neither permanent or even made to the parent shell.\nUsed the command: source LoadTools.sh instead and it worked perfectly.\n", "Q: Nvidia drivers and external connections via HDMI not working when using a dual card laptop, but works with Intel card I recently installed Ubuntu 15.04 (coming from Linux mint 17 for gnome shell). Everything works fine with the exception of my second monitor, attached to my laptop via HDMI. I installed the proprietary drivers (and nvidia prime). Switching from intel to nvidia and back again works very well. However when using nvidia the HDMI port seems to not want to play nice. I plug in the cable and the main screen (on the laptop) and the external monitor flash on and off (or black and off). When using the intel card the external monitor works fine. \nIn Mint, I was using nvidia-prime and prime-indicator to make the enter setup run on one card or another. This is the setup I would like to use. I would like to run. I want to run the entire Xorg server using either Nvidia or Intel switch as I see fit. Using prime-select nvidia or prime-select Intel has always worked very well for me in the past. I generally run Nvidia and switch to Intel when traveling for better battery life.\nWhat I have done is \n\n\n*\n\n*set the video driver for the Intel card to \"modesetting\" - X would not start at all\n\n*Downgraded the Nvidia drivers - No change\n\n*Disabled gpu-manager - No change or X wouldn't start (as expected)\n\n*Used the open source drivers for nvidia  - Work as expected but performance is horrid and there are other massive issues that prevent this from working well. \n\n*Disable Kernal Mode Setting - Xorg would not load\n\n\nI am not sure what to try next.

If in the output the line\n-rw-------  1 root root   53 Nov 29 10:19 .Xauthority\n\nthen you need to do chown username:username .Xauthority and try logging in.\nElse, do ls -ld /tmp. Check for the first 10 letters in the left: they should read exactly so: drwxrwxrwt.\ndrwxrwxrwt 15 root root 4096 Nov 30 04:17 /tmp\n\nElse, you need to do sudo chmod a+wt /tmp and check again.\nIf not both, I'd recommend you either\ndpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nor uninstall, reinstall it.\nNow press Alt+-> until you reach the login screen again, and restart.\n\nA: This is just a workaround that save me in two cases I've faced:\n\n\n*\n\n*One was a bad update of gnome-session from a PPA.\n\n*Another one, I couldn't figure out but all trials left me in front of lightdm.\n\n\nIn both cases, I got login loop with lightdm then:\n\n\n*\n\n*I switched to another display manager gdm:\nsudo apt-get install gdm\n\n\n*Reboot, login was successful.\n\nA: I had almost the same problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*When the logon screen will be shown press Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nThis will take you to TTY1.\n\n\n*\n\n*Login with your default credentials.\n\n*Type in TTY1: sudo -s\n\n*Then type: adduser username(Type whatever you want instead of username)\n\n*Choose password and confirm it.\n\n*Then go to GUI by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7\n\n*Login with your new user.\n\n*Go to System Settings>User Accounts>Your new user.\n\n*Click on Unblock and type your old user's password.\n\n*Change Account type to Administrator.\n\n*Click on your old user, select it and then click - on the bottom of the \"My Account\"'s list.\nI do this when I accidentally change my preferences of my Graphics Card\nIf you have problems with unity, Go to TTY, login as root and type:  unity --reset\nI have personally verified that this does work.  However, if your objective is only to be able to run Unity, then there does not appear to be any specific need to delete the old user, which is what you will be doing if you follow the instructions in the foregoing answer.  All I needed to do was to logout, choose the new user, and choose Unity from the gdm login screen.  If you don't delete the old user, you might also choose not to make the new user an administrator.\n\nA: What you are describing looks like what I recently faced for Ubuntu 15.04. Press Ctrl+Alt+F1, login with your user and password and Try this:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\n\nThen go back to your lightdm by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7. If it is not fixed, try rebooting. Let me know if it works for you.\n\nA: What I did\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter into recovery mode \n\n*Select build broken packages(or something like that)\n\n*Select yes\n\n*Click enter\n\n\nIt worked for me!!! \n", "Q: install php 5.3 on ubuntu 14.04 I just installed Ubuntu server 14.04, I need to migrate my site from old server Ubuntu 10.04 (which has php 5.3) to the new server,\nbut currently when i install php using\n`apt-get install php` \n\ni found the installed version is \"PHP 5.5\", how can i install 5.3?\nIf it is n't possible, what is the previous possible version of Ubuntu i should downgrade to be compatible with \"PHP 5.3\"?\n\nA: I can think of 2 different options:\n\n\n*\n\n*try the solutions posted in this topic\n\n*compile from source, although I wouldn't recommend this because you'll have to recompile after every security update \nBtw, have you tried the site under PHP 5.5?

Executable files (built programs and shell scripts) normally go in /bin or /usr/bin but what about a jar file? It is a 'program' making me think it should go in bin,  but on the other hand it requires a script to start it.\nI have a very simply script to start the jar.\njava -jar myapp.jar\n\nBut where should I put the jar file its self?\n\nA: It depends on you, i would suggest not to use any place designated to store system wide binary files. Although you can put it in /usr/local/bin or any other designated place to store system wide binary files but as it is not a regular binary file you better put somewhere else. Your home directory may be a good place too.\nActually it does not matter where you are putting this as long as you are going to use full path to call it:\njava -jar /path/to/myapp.jar\n\nWhereas if you want to put it somewhere in your PATH, you can add the path to the directory containing the file to the PATH (put it in ~/.bashrc):\nexport PATH=$PATH:/path/to/directory\n\nMake sure the directory does not contain anything else (otherwise it would be a great place for running random malicious commands !!).\nNow you can also create an alias of the command, for example:\nalias myapp='java -jar /path/to/myapp.jar'\n\nput it in ~/.bash_aliases. Now you can run the application by just typing:\nmyapp\n\n\nA: There is no definite location that you 'should' store your executable jars in. It is based solely on user preference. \nI find that keeping my executable jars on the desktop works best so i don't need to continuously travel through my file system to use them which can sometimes get lost if your memory isn't the best.\nAlso little sidenote, if you install Java 8 then you can use Oracles Java 8 Runtime so you can just double click on the jar.\nHope I helped answer your dilemma.\n", "Q: Dual booted Windows 8.1 and ubuntu.

That is just a list of all the systems that have been connected to to check if the system might have changed or a man-in-the-middle attack is being attempted.\nFor password less connections, you need a id_rsa file in .ssh folder.\nYou can copy the file and make sure is has the correct permissions. 600 for the file\nor better, create a new key for root to use.\nsudo up to root. create the key and then copy the id_rsa.pub contents to the authorized_keys on the remote system. there are steps in the link below.\nssh-keygen -t rsa\nssh - without password\nOr create your key as Root then use ssh-copy-id command, it will add the files where they need to be.\nssh-copy-id user@hostname.example.com\n", "Q: Is the Gigabyte Brix (GB-BXBT-2807) compatible with Ubuntu 14.04?

This problem has happened to me once or twice a week to me for quite a while now and today it struck the last nerve.The problem usually gets fixed when I do a restart. \n\nA: Okay, I was just narrowing down solutions here, because there are some known solutions for trackpads with similar \"non-clicking\" issues. Have you tried clicking on \"System Settings\", then \"Software & Updates\", then clicking on the \"Additional Drivers\" tab? Wait for it to search the available drivers, and enable any keyboard/mouse driver that needs to be installed. See if that works. \n\nA: I had this issue and it also affected my wireless network - couldn't use mouse or connect to wifi. All devices were found, but I was getting a bunch of errors.\nTurned out that I reset BIOS to factory defaults (then updated them to what I thought I needed) and this was my problem. I had to go back into the BIOS and find a little setting called \"IOMMU\". Enabling this solved all my issues.\nI found this out by looking in dmesg and finding a little nugget that said something like \"couldn't find MMU... disabling. blah blah...\". Once it was enabled, the irq remapping gets enabled and (i guess) the IRQs don't bash anymore.\nAnyways - hope this helps others in a similar situation.\n", "Q: Syncronize mouse sensitivity Ubuntu 14.04/Windows 7 dual boot?

The -q argument of traceroute sets the number of probes to be used.\nOn Linux systems it seems that this can only be up to 10.

Is that just arbitrary choice?\n\nA: You can not expect that any program on any system generates identical outputs. Everyone is free to adapt the source code.\nPOSIX defines the application programming interface (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of Unix and other operating systems.\n\nA: It's simply defined in the source code of the tool, among other limits:\n#define MAX_HOPS    255\n#define MAX_PROBES  10\n#define MAX_GATEWAYS_4  8\n#define MAX_GATEWAYS_6  127\n#define DEF_HOPS    30\n#define DEF_SIM_PROBES  16  /*  including several hops   */\n#define DEF_NUM_PROBES  3\n#define DEF_WAIT_SECS   5.0\n#define DEF_SEND_SECS   0\n#define DEF_DATA_LEN    40  /*  all but IP header...  */\n#define MAX_PACKET_LEN  65000\n\nThere isn't a comment indicating why, so I guess, \"arbitrary choice\" is it.\nProbably the developers thought that more than 10 per hop would not be useful and would probably not represent a sane choice.\nAre you dealing with high packet loss or jitter?  Even 10 packets should be more than enough to establish whether there is high packet loss or jitter.\n", "Q: Log Into Someone Else's Desktop from CLI Is there a way to log out & log back in as another user or the same user, all from the command line? I have seen solutions that use killall or pkill, etc., to kill all processes running as the logged-in user.\nThis certainly works, and logs me out, but when I log back in I find that all of my processes have been killed, as I totally did not expect after running that command. All my terminals are closed, as well as my browser, etc. It is as if my desktop were started fresh from being powered off.\nOn the other hand, when I \"lock\" the computer by using the context menu on the top-right corner of the screen, and then log back in, everything I had open is still open, and all of my processes have not been killed. In this context menu, \"logging out\" means \"killing all processes and starting fresh\", which is what I do not want, and \"locking\" is \"logging out but not stopping all processes so that when you log back in everything is still open\", which is what I want.\nHow do I lock the computer, without fully logging out, directly from the command line?

Update from the PPA: ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-4-4\nAppears to be a bug as you can see here. There is indeed a workaround (at least for the version 4.1, but same might work for other version too) posted in the comment#15 in the above link. To reproduce it:\n\nFor Nautilus users:\nOpen the .desktop file (such as\n/usr/share/applications/libreoffice4.1-writer.desktop for LO Writer)\nand comment the following line: X-GIO-NoFuse=true\nFor Dolphin users:\nOpen the same file, and comment the following line:\nX-KDE-Protocols=file,http,smb,ftp,webdav\n\n", "Q: How do you copy something to the clipboard when running a script triggered by incron? I've got a script that works perfectly when I run it as myself on the command line but when the script is run by incron the line that copies a value to the clipboard doesn't work. Basically I'm using incron to monitor the addition of a new file in a particular directory then upload that file to an FTP server and copy the URL to the clipboard. This is the line that fails (seemingly does nothing) when the script is run by incron:\necho -n $URL | xclip -selection clipboard\n\nMy guess is that incron doesn't have access to the clipboard in the same way that I do as a logged in user, but I don't know what to do about it. Any help would be awesome.\n\nA: xclip is an application that needs environment variables such as $XAUTHORITY and $DISPLAY to talk to the X11-server. You can create a cronjob the looks as follows:\n/bin/su your_username -c \"export XAUTHORITY='/home/your_username/.Xauthority'; export DISPLAY='$(strings /proc/$(pgrep -n Xorg)/environ | awk -F== '$1 ~ \"DISPLAY\"{print $2}')'; echo -n \"message\" | xclip -selection clipboard\"\n\nUse your own username instead of your_username. It is a long line, but cron doesn't accept multiple lines as cronjob entries. However, here is what it does:\n\n\n*\n\n*/bin/su your_username: it switches the user\n\n*-c \"...\": and runs the command in the quotes\n\n*export XAUTHORITY='...';: first we need the $XAUTHORITY variable\n\n*export DISPLAY='...': and the $DISPLAY variable, this is mostly :0, but if not, we can get the variable from the environment of the Xorg process\n\n*echo ... | xclip ...: finally run the desired command within that environment. No need to use absolute paths anymore because we have a minimal environment now.\n\n", "Q: Errors encountered when installing kubuntu on 15.04 I ran:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nand after it gave me this error message:\ndpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/kde-config-telepathy-accounts_15.04.1-0ubuntu1~ubuntu15.04~ppa1_i386.deb (--unpack):\n trying to overwrite '/usr/share/accounts/services/google-im.service', which is also in package account-plugin-google 0.12+15.04.20150415.1-0ubuntu2\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/kde-config-telepathy-accounts_15.04.1-0ubuntu1~ubuntu15.04~ppa1_i386.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nand whenever I try to install a new program or run the suggested solution to this problem, which was mentioned after I tried to install another program, sudo apt-get -f install I get the same error message again.\nEDIT: Requested outputs.\nsudo apt-get --configure -a\n\ngives this (too large to fit in the question).\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\ngives:\nReading package lists...

For example if user input 2 2 on the commandline the shell will generate a 2D array base on that? thank you\n\nA: bash is an interpreted language, and it doesn't need to know how much memory to allocate in advance.\nSo it's possible to dinamically initialize a new array without having declared it or to expand an already declared array to add more entries, however it's not possible to use multidimensional arrays.\nHowever this can be faked: since you didn't provide an exact task to accomplish, I'll provide a bash script example which shows how to fill in an user-defined m x n table with random numbers (which are not really random, since each column will always have the same number on all its rows in each run, but this is not relevant to the question) and print it (simplified from this Stack Overflow answer):\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndeclare -a array\nread -p 'm: ' m\nread -p 'n: ' n\nfor ((i=0; i<m; i++))\ndo\n    for ((j=0; j<n; j++))\n    do\n        a[${i},${j}]=$RANDOM\n    done\ndone\nfor ((i=0; i<m; i++))\ndo\n    for ((j=0; j<n; j++))\n    do\n        echo -ne \"${a[${i},${j}]}\\t\"\n    done\n    echo\ndone\n\n\nA: You could declare a 1D array and read all numbers into a 1D array at runtime. After knowing the dimension, you could process the 1D array \"like a 2D array\".\nFor instance, suppose 1D array contains\n[1, 5, 9, 11]\n\nIf we really want \n[[1,5], [9,11]]\n\nas our array such that the index 0 is [1,5] then you could do something like this to access [1,5] (pos = 0)\npseudocode\nfor i in 0:(pos*dim + dim-1)  \n    echo arr[i]\n\nto access [9,11] (pos = 1)\nfor i in pos*dim:(pos*dim + dim - 1)\n    echo arr[i]\n\nHopefully this makes some sense.

Just don't do that. It's not useful at all to match against a wildcard if you're trying to mount a single ISO image, leaving aside that fact that you want your / mount point to keep holding the root partition. Mount the ISO image specifying its exact filename and mount it on the mount point you just created (/media/cdrom). In order to do that, make sure that the ISO image you want to mount is present in your home directory and change ubuntu-* with the full name of the ISO image.

I followed both Sharad's and A.B.'s answers (both of them) on a previous question about Kubuntu. I then rebooted LXDE and managed to get into Grub, I then selected to run Ubuntu, normally (i.e., the default option given) and while it seemed to be loading normally (i.e., it showed the Ubuntu logo with the five circles that change their colour to reflect that Ubuntu is loading) for a while after that, it eventually left me at a blank black screen with only my mouse cursor visible. I waited patiently for this to pass, I assumed it was only temporary but it didn't pass, after twenty minutes of waiting nothing happened. So at this time I am on my live USB (in \"Try Ubuntu\" mode) and hoping someone in this grand community can help me.

Everything is so laggy and prone to these stream of black pixels following my mouse cursor I can't even open a web browser and read stuff in it. See when I open a web browser, it opens but the blank pixels pop up when I scroll down in the browser.

Several programs were also uninstalled, although I was asked during installation whether I wanted these programs to be reinstalled, I selected that I wanted them to be reinstalled. Later in the installation of Ubuntu from within my live session (I can confirm my internet connection was fine on this live session), however, I was informed that an error had occurred that prevented the installation of these additional programs from the live session. After rebooting from the live session I was able to login successfully into my main installation, so a partial success was achieved, but my internet connection could no longer be established. \nSo I eventually opted to erase my HDD and install Ubuntu 15.04 from scratch on the HDD, after I had backed up the files I absolutely needed. \nThis issue reoccurred when I reinstalled Kubuntu on this new installation. It is likely a bug.\n", "Q: Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu edition usable in United States? Can the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu edition currently being sold in Europe (http://www.bq.com/gb/aquaris-e4-5-ubuntu-edition) be used in the United States with an American SIM card/service provider? A friend is traveling to Europe and I was thinking of asking them to pick one up for me if it'd be possible to use it here.\n\nA: There are two things you will have to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need a power adapter. That should be no problem.\n\n*You have to check if US service providers use one of these 3G HSPA+ (900/2100), 2G GSM (850/900/1800/1900) frequencies.\nIn the US the frequencies 850 and 1900 are used, and hence the phone should work. This seems to be verified by some US users on youtube. (The phone is unlocked).\n\n*At least here, the phone is not available in shops. So you might want to order it in time to the European address, where your friend is going to stay.\nThe phone is definitely worth a try, though sometimes still rough around the edges (ubuntu-touch), but getting regular updates...\n", "Q: how to change file extensions in a directory I have many files in a directory having extension.\n.text(2)\n.text(1)\n\nI want to remove the numbers from extension and output should be like\n.text \n.text\n\nCan anyone please help me with the shell script for that?i am using CentOs 6.3.\n\nA: Start the one-liner in the folder where the files are saved or change the path for the find command.

But\nIn one case the failure will not create any output so it will appear that \"nothing happened\" when really \"copying failed due to name collision\" happened. \nThis case occurs when one file has no (n) suffix and one other has.\neg if existing files are foo.txt and foo.txt(1) then the rename of foo.txt(1) would create a duplicate if allowed so will not occur, and  so no action will take place.\nfoo.txt, foo.txt(1) -> no change\nBut if existing files are eg foo.txt(1) and foo.txt(2) then the rename of foo.txt(1) would NOT create a duplicate so will occur BUT the rename of foo.txt(2) subsequently would create a duplicate if allowed so no second-file-rename action will take place.\nfoo.txt(1), foo.txt(2) -> foo.txt, foo.txt(2) (probably)\n", "Q: screen garbled after suspend when not using unity When using unity or gnome my laptop wakes up from suspend and everything works properly.\nWhen using i3, the laptop wakes up from suspend but the screen is garbled, and I need to reboot, not even a lightdm restart helps.\nI am using unity-settings-daemon, should I start another process that fixes this and is already running in unity?\n\nA: Your issue doesn't specify any hardware types.

Turns out moving the venv folder seems to break the venv's pip path.  I was able to reproduce by creating a new one and moving it again.\nWith the venv activated, if you run\nset | grep test1\nyou can see the venv bin directory is added to the path.\nSo one solution is just create the venv exactly where you want it and don't move it. Or else modify the venv's activate shell script to change the VIRTUAL_ENV value.\n", "Q: How can I clean residual config files with BleachBit app? I want to clean residual config files with BleachBit like Synaptic Package Manager can do this.

So you have to search for these files of each package alone then send its path to bleachbit.

Dovecot, is NOT a SMTP server, it's an IMAP/POP3 server, which is used to serve Mailboxes to the end user.\nTo receive mail you need a SMTP server, like Postfix or Exim4.\nTo send Mail, you need a SMTP client, like sendmail.\nIf you want to add a Web Interface, you'll also need a WebServer (Like Apache2 or Nginx) and a web application like Roundcube.\nDo not forget that if you want to test mail sending/receiving in almost real-world condition, it could be a good idea to add a DNS Server, like Bind9.\n", "Q: Connect java with mysql in ubuntu server I am trying to connect my Java application with MySql running on an Ubuntu server 14.04 installed on Virtual Box in the same machine as my application.

I got an old Dell Inspiron 700m with the intent of learning about computers. I replaced the stock hard drive with a 120gb and upgraded the ram to 2gb. It took a while, but after figuring out the CPU could only handle 32bit I managed to get 32bit Ubuntu installed via DVD boot disk burned from a windows 8 computer.\nHowever, it is very slow, typing lags and opening applications is very slow and not smooth. I'm thinking that my little laptop has trouble keeping up with Ubuntu and that I should switch to Xubuntu. \nIf I understand correctly, Xubuntu operates on a XFCE Desktop Environment. I managed to find the Xubuntu iso but cannot figure out how to create a bootable disk (working from the ubuntu laptop).\nAny recommendations on how to get Xubuntu loaded, or any other recommendations ?\nI'm a newby to all of this and I would appreciate as much description of terms and processes as possible, since I'm doing this to learn as much as possible.\n\nA: You don't need to do a complete removal to install Xubuntu desktop environment, if you want to refuse from Unity at all just do the following:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntu-desktop\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge unity\n\nTo do more thorough purge:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge unity*\n\nThe last one might remove Nautilus too, xfce uses Thunar by default but if you're planning on using it again after you install xubuntu-desktop just run:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus\n\nTo set it as default you can run:\nexo-preferred-applications\n\nAnd choose Nautilus as prefered one. Next install xfce:\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop xfce4\n\nAfter all of this you'll see improvements in speed but you might need also to configure it a bit as it's a different desktop environment and some applications like Ubuntu Tweak tool will not function that much as in Unity.\nAt the end you can run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nJust to do a cleanup if any.\n\nA: You can try to install XFCE using the xubuntu-desktop package. Using, APT (the ubuntu package manager), you would do :\n apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nBut I would recommend you to do a fresh-install.\nIf you want to create an USB stick with the Xubuntu iso you can use the dd command. \ndd is used to dump data from a block peripheral from another one, here is an example (where /dev/sdb is the block peripheral representing the USB key):\n dd if=/path/to/image.iso of=/dev/sdb\n\nXFCE is, indeed, more lightweight. But since you're on a very old configuration I would recommend you to give Lubuntu a shot. It's based upon  LXDE which is really lightweight.\n", "Q: Bash program to open files on a second monitor I've written a little script in bash that opens a file and then five minutes later closes it.

For example, with wmctrl, you can use -e:\n   -e <MVARG>\n          Resize  and  move  a  window  that  has been specified with a -r\n          action according to the <MVARG> argument.\n   <MVARG>\n          A move and resize argument has the format 'g,x,y,w,h'.  All five\n          components are integers. The first value, g, is the  gravity  of\n          the  window,  with  0  being  the most common value (the default\n          value for the window). Please see  the  EWMH  specification  for\n          other values.\n\n          The four remaining values are a standard geometry specification:\n          x,y is the position of the top left corner of  the  window,  and\n          w,h  is  the  width and height of the window, with the exception\n          that the value of -1 in any position is interpreted to mean that\n          the current geometry value should not be modified.\n\nYou can usually ignore gravity, so to place a window at the top left corner of your screen and make it 1200 x 700 pixels, you would run:\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 1,1,1,1200,700\n\nThe -r lets you select a window and :ACTIVE: means the currently focused window. \nYou can also simplify your script. There is no reason to parse ps, the special variable $! holds the PID of the job most recently placed in the background. In any case, parsing ps will often fail since there might be multiple processes matching Thesis.pdf. There will always be two: the evince and the grep Thesis.pdf you just ran. \nSo, with all that in mind, you could do:\n#! /bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n    ## Open the pdf\n    evince ~/doc/a.pdf &\n    ## Save the PID of evince\n    pid=\"$!\"\n    ## Wait for a 1.5 seconds. This is to give the window time to\n    ## appear. Change it to a higher value if your system is slower. \n    sleep 1.5\n    ## Get the X name of the evince window\n    name=$(wmctrl -lp | awk -vpid=\"$pid\" '$3==pid{print $1}')\n    ## Position the window\n    wmctrl -ir \"$name\" -e 1,1,1,1200,700\n    ## Wait\n    sleep 5m\n    ## Close it\n    kill \"$pid\"\ndone\n\nNote that I removed the exit 0 since, because of your while true, it will never be reached and there's no point to it. You can play with the positional arguments to figure out where you want to place the window. \nFinally, a note on DISPLAY. This variables points to an X display. This is not a screen, it is the active X server. Many users might be running parallel X servers on a single machine, this allows you to choose which one of them a window should be displayed on. It has absolutely nothing to do with how many physical screens are connected, unless each screen is running a separate X  session. \n\nA: This answer assumes you are using Unity:\nWhat you will run into when writing a script to open an application on a specific sreen or positon\nIf you want to call an application and, subsequently, place its window on a specific position and size, the time between calling the application and the moment the window actually appears, is essential, but unpredictable; if your system is occupied, it can be significantly longer than if it is idle.\nYou need a (preferably \"smart\") way to make sure the positioning/resizing is done (immediately) after the window appears.\nThe script below (an edited version of this one) opens an application, possibly with the file as argument, on any place on your desktop (on the second monitor as well). It waits for the window to appear before it moves the window to its position and size, so it will run correctly, no matter if your system is slow (or occupied) or not.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\napp = (\" \").join(sys.argv[5:])\n\nget = lambda x: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", x]).decode(\"utf-8\")\nws1 = get(\"wmctrl -lp\"); t = 0\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", app])\n\nwhile t < 30:      \n    ws2 = [w.split()[0:3] for w in get(\"wmctrl -lp\").splitlines() if not w in ws1]\n    procs = [[(p, w[0]) for p in get(\"ps -e ww\").splitlines() \\\n              if app in p and w[2] in p] for w in ws2]\n    if len(procs) > 0:\n        w_id = procs[0][0][1]\n        cmd1 = \"wmctrl -ir \"+w_id+\" -b remove,maximized_horz\"\n        cmd2 = \"wmctrl -ir \"+w_id+\" -b remove,maximized_vert\"\n        cmd3 = \"xdotool windowsize --sync \"+procs[0][0][1]+\" \"+sys.argv[3]+\"% \"+sys.argv[4]+\"%\"\n        cmd4 = \"xdotool windowmove \"+procs[0][0][1]+\" \"+sys.argv[1]+\" \"+sys.argv[2]\n        for cmd in [cmd1, cmd2, cmd3, cmd4]:   \n            subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n        break\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    t = t+1\n\n\nHow to use it\n\n\n*\n\n*install both xdotool and wmctrl.

(> 1680 in this case).\nTo open the file with your application in a maximized way, set both <horizontal-size (%)> and <vertical-size (%)> to 100.\nMinor issue\nIn Unity, when you (re-)position and (re-)size a window with either wmctrl or xdotool, the window will always keep a small marge to the borders of your screen, unless you set it to 100%. You can see that in the image (3) above; while the inkscape window was placed on x position 0, you can still see a minor marge between the Unity Launcher and the inkscape window.\n\nA: I'm taking an absolute shot-in-the-dark, here, but a workaround for now could be this script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Author: Andrew Martin\n# Credit: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1309247\necho \"Enter the primary display from the following:\"            # prompt for the display\nxrandr --prop | grep \"[^dis]connected\" | cut --delimiter=\" \" -f1    # query connected monitors\nread choice                             # read the users's choice of monitor\nxrandr --output $choice --primary                   # set the primary monitor\n\nI believe this worked, for me, to set my middle monitor instead of my laptop monitor to the \"main monitor.\" This, in theory, will open your program in the main monitor?-- I know you said it opens where you mouse is, but, it's a li'l shot...\nHope you solve it :)\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu alongside windows? I already have Windows 8.1 on my ultrabook, how do i install ubuntu alongside it? i do not have a spare usb drive nor does my laptop have an optical drive. \n\nA: One possibility to do it would be to use virtual machines, for instance, by using virtualbox. Virtualbox can be used to create a \"new machine\" within your existing system into which you can install.\nVirtualbox is able to mount iso files so that even without a physical optical drive installer CDs can be made to appear as virtual optical drives on a client virtual machine.\n", "Q: Unable to acess SQLite database in Ubuntu using PHP under Apache I am having trouble using SQLite3 with PHP in Ubuntu but it works well with Windows.

The below code helps to download youtube videos as m4a but not us mp3\nyoutube-dl -f bestaudio --audio-quality 0 --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYRruMbyFRcBVdVN8v4FNkIKkXvL-bZn_\n\ncan you tell me how to use bestaudio parameter to download YouTube video as mp3\n\nA: I recommend use Pafy (Python), very easy to get audio link, and you can download directly if you want: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pafy\n\n*http://pythonhosted.org/pafy/\n#python3\nimport pafy\nvideo = pafy.new('video id or video url')\nbestaudio = video.getbestaudio()\nbestaudio.bitrate #get bit rate\nbestaudio.extension #extension of audio fileurl\n...\nbestaudio.url #get url\n...\n#download if you want\nbestaudio.download()\n\n\nA: It is also worth noting other pieces out of man youtube-dl (a online copy can be found here):\n(For those thinking TL;DR, just read the 4th paragraph, and you can use youtube-dl -x URL as it should download the best quality anyway :)\nAlso youtube-dl -f bestaudio URL works in my experience! However with both these options most of the time you will need convert to MP3 using ffmpeg or similar - since you are already editing the file you can also tag it (use the old ID3 version for most device compatibility!).\n\nFORMAT SELECTION\nBy  default  youtube-dl tries to download the best quality, but sometimes you may want to download other format.  The simplest case is requesting a specific  format, for example -f 22. You can get the list of available formats using --list-formats, you can also use a file extension (currently  it  supports  aac,  m4a, mp3, mp4, ogg, wav, webm) or the special names best, bestvideo, bestaudio and worst.\nIf  you  want  to  download  multiple  videos  and  they don't have the same formats available, you can specify the order of preference using slashes, as in-f 22/17/18.  You can also filter the video results by putting a condition in brackets, as in -f \"best[height=720]\" (or -f\n  \"[filesize>10M]\").   This  works for  filesize,  height,  width, tbr, abr, vbr, asr, and fps and the comparisons <, <=, >, >=, =, != and for ext, codec, vcodec, container, and protocol and the comparisons =, != .  Formats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a question mark (?) after the operator.  You can combine  format  filters,  so  -f \"[height <=? 720][tbr>500]\" selects up to 720p videos (or videos where the height is not known) with a bitrate of at least 500 KBit/s.\nUse commas to download multiple formats, such as -f 136/137/mp4/bestvideo,140/m4a/bestaudio.  You can merge the video and\n  audio of two formats into a single\n         file using -f <video-format>+<audio-format> (requires ffmpeg or avconv), for example -f bestvideo+bestaudio.\nSince the end of April 2015 and version 2015.04.26 youtube-dl uses -f bestvideo+bestaudio/best as default format selection (see #5447, #5456).  If ffmpeg or avconv are installed this results in downloading bestvideo and bestaudio separately and muxing them together into a single file giving  the  best  overall  quality  available. Otherwise  it  falls  back to best and results in downloading best available quality served as a single file. best is also needed for videos that don't come from YouTube because they don't provide the audio and video in two different files. If you want to only download some  dash  formats (for  example  if  you  are not interested in getting videos with a resolution higher than 1080p), you can add -f bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio/best to your configuration file.  Note that if you use youtube-dl to stream to stdout (and most likely to pipe it to your media player then), i.e. you  explicitly specify  output  template  as  -o -, youtube-dl still uses -f best format selection in order to start content delivery immediately to your player and not to wait until bestvideo and bestaudio are downloaded and muxed.\nIf you want to preserve the old format selection behavior (prior to youtube-dl 2015.04.26), i.e.  you want to download best\n  available quality  media  served  as a single file, you should explicitly specify your choice with -f best.  You may want to add it to the configuration file (#configuration) in order not to type it every time you run youtube-dl.\n...\nCan you please put the -b option back?\nMost people asking this question are not aware that youtube-dl now defaults to downloading the highest available quality as reported by YouTube, which  will be 1080p or 720p in some cases, so you no longer need the -b option.  For some specific videos, maybe YouTube does not report them to be available in a specific high quality format you're interested in.  In that case, simply request it with the -f option and youtube-dl will try to download it.\n\nYoutube (probably as it is supposed to be a video playing site) also apparently compresses the audio (see here) down to 120~KBs, which is quite low but for the most part seems OK.\nTo compare download videos, you can query the downloaded video/audio tracks (you may need to use avprobe instead of ffprobe) to see which is best:\n$ ffprobe -hide_banner output-output-loads-of-options.webm\nInput #0, matroska,webm, from 'output-output-loads-of-options.webm':\n  Metadata:\n    encoder         : google\n  Duration: 00:04:02.63, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 118 kb/s\n    Stream #0:0(eng): Audio: vorbis, 44100 Hz, stereo, fltp (default)\n$ ffprobe -hide_banner output_with_just_-x.ogg \n\nInput #0, ogg, from 'output_with_just_-x':\n  Duration: 00:04:02.65, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 117 kb/s\n    Stream #0:0(eng): Audio: vorbis, 44100 Hz, stereo, fltp, 128 kb/s\n    Metadata:\n      LANGUAGE        : eng\n      ENCODER         : Lavf56.4.101\n\n\nA: If you only want the mp3 file:\nyoutube-dl -f bestaudio  \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYRruMbyFRcBVdVN8v4FNkIKkXvL-bZn_\" --exec \"ffmpeg -i {}  -codec:a libmp3lame -qscale:a 0 {}.mp3 && rm {} \"\n\nIf you do not want to remove the original file:\nyoutube-dl -f bestaudio  \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYRruMbyFRcBVdVN8v4FNkIKkXvL-bZn_\" --exec \"ffmpeg -i {}  -codec:a libmp3lame -qscale:a 0 {}.mp3 \"\n\n\nA: From man youtube-dl:\n-x, --extract-audio                  Convert video files to audio-only files (requires ffmpeg or avconv and ffprobe or avprobe)\n    --audio-format FORMAT            Specify audio format: \"best\", \"aac\", \"vorbis\", \"mp3\", \"m4a\", \"opus\", or \"wav\"; \"best\" by default\n    --audio-quality QUALITY          Specify ffmpeg/avconv audio quality, insert a value between 0 (better) and 9 (worse) for VBR or a specific bitrate like 128K (default\n\nSo your command could be:\nyoutube-dl -f bestaudio --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0 <Video-URL>\n\nThe --audio-quality 0 uses the highest encoding quality but can increase your file size unnecessarily. The default is 5 and might be a better choice depending on the source quality.\nSo, if quality and file size matter to you, you should avoid re-encoding and stay with Youtube's native music formats:\nyoutube-dl -f bestaudio[ext=m4a] --embed-thumbnail --add-metadata <Video-URL>\n\nresulting in an m4a file or\nyoutube-dl -f bestaudio --extract-audio --embed-thumbnail --add-metadata <Video-URL>\n\nprobably resulting in an ogg file.\nYou can list the available format with\nyoutube-dl -F <Video-URL>\n\n", "Q: Characters missing / corrupted text Ubuntu 14.04 (and other versions) Intel 5th gen In Ubuntu 14.04 from one day to another characters start to be missing in all applications (Ubuntu menus, thunderbird, etc).\nHow to fix this?\n\nA: As already stated characters are missing all over the place.

Most of them will probably work, although I haven't gone and poked for specific hardware compatibility\nHowever, you're going to be somewhat limited.  An Ethernet over USB adapter is limited by the speeds of USB.  If you have a gigabit USB-to-Ethernet device, connected to a gigabit network, you're actually going to be limited to 480 Megabits a second (for USB 2.0), or possibly slower. Keep this in mind going forward.\n", "Q: When using && and sudo on the first command, is the second command run as sudo too? If I run a command.\nsudo some-command && some-other-command\n\nIs the second command being run with sudo previlege also?\n\nA: No, either you must write sudo twice, or do something like\nsudo bash -c 'foo && bar'\n\n\nA: No. Some examples that do this are:\nsudo some-command && sudo some-other-command \nsudo sh -c \"some-command && some-other-command\"\n\nor if you want nest commands you can even do:\nsudo bash <<\"EOF\"\nsome-command\nsome-other-command\nsudo bash <<\"EOF2\"\n    some-command2\n    some-other-command2\nEOF2\nEOF\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The 2nd uses another shell.\n\n*Mind that when you use ' or \" in the 2nd version you need to escape those in the commands or parameters of that command (ie. \\' or \\\") so that can get complex very quickly.\n\n\nA: && means that the right sided (second) command will only run only if the lest sided (first) command is successful i.e. exit code $? is 0. \nThe two commands are different from each other and will run in their own environments so the second command will not run having sudo privilege.\nThis will make you clear:\n$ sudo whoami && whoami \nroot\nfoobar\n\n\nA: TL;DR: NO\n\nThe first command is\nsudo some-command\n\nThe second command is\nsome-other-command\n\nThe command sudo takes the following command and executes it with elevated privileges. The &&, however, doesn't belong to a command and is interpreted by the shell, before executing the first command. It tells bash to first execute the first command, and on success the second one.\nSo the sudo doesn't know about the && some-other command. When the elevated process terminates, bash takes its return value, and then executes the other command, which again doesn't know of the first one.\nThis can be demonstrated easily:\n$ sudo whoami && whoami\nroot\nusername\n\nTo reach what you want, you can start an elevated bash, and let it execute both commands:\n$ sudo bash -c 'whoami && whoami'\nroot\nroot\n\nSo now, both commands are executed as root, as the whole process described above is executed in an elevated process, i.e. the bash session started with this command, which immediately exits after finishing. Still, the both whoamis don't know of each others existence.\nThis does not suit any purpose but for this demonstration, the easier way is to simply do\nsudo some-command && sudo some-other-command\n\n\nA: NO, and the following was once very commonly macro'd.\nsudo reboot && exit\n\nJust about everybody should have done this at least once\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThus it is a great \"mickey mouse\" interview question.\nThis is so easily tested that the question may be suspected to a stat padding exercise.\n\nA: On the command line, when you see\n$ command one && command two\n\nthe typical intent is to execute the command that follows the && only if the first command is successful.\nIs the other command runs as sudo also?\nabsolutely no, this is just as writing two consecutive  commands, this && gives no added privilege to a command. It's just a seperator.\nTo prove that let us take an example.\ntouch fileA fileB \n\nI created two files fileA and fileB. Now I'll run the command\nsudo chown test:test fileA && chown test:test fileB\n\nI'm changing user and group owner of these files to user and group name test. Now the first command should run while what about the other?\nThe output is:\nchown: changing ownership of `fileB': Operation not permitted\n\nSo the command didn't run since it needs sudo and though we can conclude that && is not a replacement of the second sudo\n", "Q: Disable Touchpad of Logitech TK820 on Xubuntu 14.04.2 LTS How can I disable only the touchpad of the TK820 (Combination multi-gesture touchpad and keyboard)?

Ok, so I am a n00b. Keep that in mind. My Ubuntu computer is running an Apache2 server for basic web hosting and file transfer. If I wanted to use an external hard drive for it, how would I go about it? I mean, the var, www, and html folders are stored in the computer's storage. I want to combine the storage from the internal computer and external drive for total storage for the /var/www\n\nA: *\n\n*You should mount the drive and make sure it mounts automatically after a restart. \n\n*You can use a symlink to the folder on the external drive. You could link directly in the vhost or apache config, but using symlinks simplifies most of the time. \n\n*You need to set proper rights so Apache can write to that folder. On Ubuntu, Apache is run as user www-data, so make sure www-data can write to that folder.\n\n\nA: I specify beforehand that I have absolutely no experience with Apache\nHaving said that you might want to do the following\nBefore connecting the external drive\nsudo fdisk -l\nRepeat the above command after connecting the drive\nYou will see a new entry in the output (probably at the end). Observe the device column of this entry. This is the block file that represents your drive. It will be something like /dev/yourdrivesfile . \nNow make a folder in /var/www and then mount the drive on it by:\nsudo mount -o defaults /dev/yourdrivesfile /var/www/yourfolder\nBefore you do this try learning about the mount command and its options, you might need them. man mount and info mount will also help.\nChanging permissions of your folder to allow www-data (Apache) to write to it might be something like sudo chown www-data /var/www/yourfolder, though I 'm not sure about this part.\nHope this helps with the mounting atleast.\n", "Q: Ballsed up with ccsm, can't see unity any more Im running ubuntu 14.04\nWhilst playing with ccsm, which I know nothing about, I inadvertently ballsed up my desktop and. Ow I can't see the unity bar or launch anything.\nI think its because I did something with the'Expo' setting then blithely ignoring a warning about Unity.\nAnyone help me undo my mistake and get unity back?\nThat ks\n\nA: Settings in CCSM are user-specific. This means you can delte them by deletiong some files in home folder, but I do not know what. \nWhat I can say is: As a last resort, get to console (Ctrl Alt F1) and create a new user (adduser unitybreaker or smth.). Then relogin as that user.\n", "Q: Should a 14.04 server iso operate as a live CD? Do the Ubuntu 14.04 Server installation .iso files come with a 'Try Ubuntu' option, or is that only on the Desktop versions? In other words, can I use this media as a live CD, for tasks such as administering and imaging partitions?\n\nA: There is no 'Try Ubuntu' option In server editions, the LiveCD use the GUI since it boots in GUI mode to use the apps and other software inside.\nSo you have to use the Desktop iso as LiveCd and don't be frighten you can use the desktop iso to do administration tasks, since mostly there is no major difference between desktop and server versions unless the GUI related apps.\nWhat's the difference between desktop and server?\nQuoted from Ubuntu docs:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first difference is in the CD contents. The \"Server\" CD avoids including what Ubuntu considers desktop packages (packages like X,\nGnome or KDE), but does include server related packages (Apache2,\nBind9 and so on). Using a Desktop CD with a minimal installation and\ninstalling, for example, apache2 from the network, one can obtain the\nexact same result that can be obtained by inserting the Server CD and\ninstalling apache2 from the CD-ROM.\n\n*The Ubuntu Server Edition installation process is slightly different from the Desktop Edition. Since by default Ubuntu Server doesn't have\na GUI, the process is menu driven, very similar to the Alternate CD\ninstallation process.\n\n*Before 12.04, Ubuntu server installs a server-optimized kernel by default. Since 12.04, there is no difference in kernel between Ubuntu\nDesktop and Ubuntu Server since linux-image-server is merged into\nlinux-image-generic.\n\n*For Ubuntu LTS releases before 12.04, the Ubuntu Desktop Edition only receives 3 years of support. This was increased to 5 years in\nUbuntu LTS 12.04 In contrast, all Ubuntu LTS Server Edition releases\nare supported for 5 years.\n\n\n", "Q: How to transfer Launchpad SSH and OpenPGP keys to another computer?

There may be a way of doing this yourself but (at least for IPv4) the easiest way of doing this at the moment is using a service like ip2location.\nThey'll give you an entire list. They'll actually give you a list in iptables format. \nGet what you need, run them (to block them immediately) and then save them into /etc/network/iptables.rules so they're picked up next boot. Or use iptables-persistent.\n\nThat will block from any port. If you want to just block a single port from that list, you'll need to condition it by adding a --dport 27115 to each line:\nsed -i 's/ -j/ --dport 27115 -j/' downloaded.rules\n\nThen load them up.\n", "Q: Backdoor.Linux.Gafgyt.A - How to detect an infection with this backdoor.

With recent updates on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installation, Google Chrome has changed in appearance such that its address bar has doubled in size. You can see Chrome on the left side and Firefox on the right side in the following screenshot:\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The identical issue has been addressed in a previous post. In comments, it has been suggested to remove google-chrome-stable and to use google-chrome-beta as an interim solution.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu from Elementary OS I installed Elementary OS and want to switch to Ubuntu. However, I am unable to boot into the live USB. Is there another way to make the switch?\n\nA: The issue would not be related to elementary, it is most likely in your BIOS setup on the hardware. The actual setup would depend on whether you have legacy or UEFI boot, so it is difficult to guess which one. When the system first boots there is usually a prompt to enter setup that changes from system to system, something like \"enter f10 for setup\" It can scroll by pretty quick. Most often something like this will be the order of boot. The list should have removable media (USB) higher in the order than the hard drive. If it is UEFI you may need to disable secure UEFI in order to get a list of UEFI supported boot options, this is where you would select from the list which boot option you want.\n\nA: In theory, elementary OS is actually Ubuntu. They share the same kernel, most of the repositories and most of the software. The main differences between them are the desktop and user applications, as both systems have made their own.\nDepending on which elementary OS version you are using, you can get back to the following Ubuntu \"vanilla\" version:\n\n\n*\n\n*elementary OS 0.2 Luna -> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\n*elementary OS 0.3 Freya -> Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n\n*elementary OS 0.4 Loki -> Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n\n\nFully \"reinstalling\" Ubuntu can be quite complex for many people, as it may completely break the system - but if you just want the Ubuntu desktop back, you could try running the following command, for example:\nsudo apt-get remove pantheon-greeter && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop unity unity-greeter\n\nA: Your question is pretty unclear.\nAssuming you are on Elementary OS, you should have access to the Software Center. From there, install Startup Disk Creator. From there, select the Ubuntu ISO downloaded from the official website, and the targeted USB device. You can then follow the official guide.\nInstinctively, I would say that USB booting is not enabled on your BIOS. Have a look at this Lifehacker article for more info.\nEdit: The official guide states that \"If you're using UEFI, do not currently use Unetbootin with Debian iso files due to a bug.\"\nMake sure you are using a 64bit image, 32bit are apparently hard to install in UEFI.\nHave you considered creating an EFI-only image ?\n\nA: I am up and running in 'vanilla' Ubuntu now. Thanks for all the help.\nI tried everyone's suggestions without much success. I am sure now the USB stick was the problem. I don't really understand why I was able to install Elementary OS from it and not Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Set root to current drive in GRUB GRUB require one to set the root drive in its config. Usually one write something like search --set=root /boot/vmlinuz or explicitly set root=(hd0,1). I found this little excessive considering the fact that GRUB already know the drive it loads config from. How can I force grub to set root to the drive he used to read config from?\n\nA: That is what it defaults to; explicitly setting it just gives the ability to change it to another drive.  It is useful if your root partition is different ( different partition on the same disk, or another disk ) than your /boot partition.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 flickering screen on high resolution I have a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 7548 with Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 dual boot. It has a built-in 4k display with Intel HD Graphics 5500(Broadwell GT2) graphics. Everything runs as normal on Windows, but on Ubuntu the screen flickers. It seems a random stuff, but the one situation where it always happens is when I open Chrome and start typing in the address bar. The only way can get almost rid of the issue is by lowering the resolution by half, which makes things look really bad and still get the flickering from time to time.\nAny help is much appreciated. \n\nA: I have a lenovo thinkpad e550 with Intel HD Graphics 5500 and ubuntu 14.04.

I tried to copy using Nautilus, Thunar and terminal cp. After copying the file is displayed on the flash drive, but if you insert it into another computer or put out and put it back - it does not exist.\n\nA: Did you unmount the USB drive before removing it? In Unix systems it's important to unmount removables otherwise the changes will not be written to it successfully.\n\nA: This is probably a permission issue. Either you mounted it in read only or you have got the file in some wrong permission. Did you try viewing hidden files on the other computer? I would suggest transfering your files too a windows to see if the files arent your probleme. \n\nA: I had a similar issue.  \nOn a usb device I had already copied files to, the next time I tried I got error messages about input output errors.  What I found was that the folder I had created on the usb had become corrupted.  The best I can figure is that I had removed the device before closing the application ( in this case Krusader) I had used to copy the files.\nMy answer was to delete that folder, create a new one, and copy my files.  Just make sure to close all involved applications before removing the device.  That's what solved my problem.\n\nA: unmount it in disks (accessories) mount it back in disks    (accessories) navigate in the file explorer to 'File System > Media >    Ubuntu' right click on your USB device search for and click 'Open As    Administrator'\nVoila!\n", "Q: Once Ubuntu 14.04LTS is installed, is it necessary to enable network devices or drivers?

For each line/file, I run md5sum on it and append the result to a variable. Finally the variable is output using zenity as you originally did.\nThis will simply show the md5sum for any selected files (it works for more than 2 files too), so you can visually determine if they're the same.

I first installed just Xubuntu without any trouble, all was working well including no trouble connecting to wireless internet. But then I decided to also install Windows 7. I managed to do that and was able to switch between the two. For some reason Windows 7 wasn't able to find any Ethernet drivers (Ethernet Controller was missing according to Windows). I tried to update Windows from CD, but then it made trouble, and now when I choose to boot with Windows, it gives me a black screen. I think I managed to hear the sound signal it makes to log me in when I just tried to write my password for logging in. \nIf I boot with Xubuntu, everything still works perfectly.\nI'm considering reinstalling Windows, and give up Xubuntu. Maybe its causing the trouble for Windows. \nAny ideas about what is happening in my situation?\n\nA: Whatever happened, I'm pretty sure it's unrelated to the installed Linux system. Missing drivers in Windows certainly are, the other thing I'm not quite sure about.\n\nTo analyse this problem, please use the Windows setup DVD to repair boot problems. This will make Xubuntu unbootable, but you can fix that later. Just make sure you have an Ubuntu live USB or CD/DVD (no matter which flavor) in order to be able to reinstall the GRUB boot loader if you decide to go back to Linux or dual booting.\nIf your Windows comes up without problems after using the boot repair utility from Windows' setup DVD, the problem seems to have been related to GRUB. If not, the problem is not related to the installed Xubuntu. In this case, please ask on SuperUser or a Windows/Microsoft forum for further help.\n\nIf you choose to keep on using Xubuntu, be it with or without Windows installed alongside, restore GRUB following these instructions.\nPS: If you get your Windows back, you can download the necessary Ethernet drivers in Xubuntu, put the installer(s) on the Windows partition (or preferably a shared personal partition, if you made one), boot to Windows and install the drivers from there.\n", "Q: Wacom Bamboo USB (CTH-301) not working on Ubuntu 15.04 Just bought a Wacom Bamboo.

I am very curious as to how it will affect bios settings. And how it will affect grub2. I have dual booted 15.04 with windows 8.1\n\nA: Depends on how your system is configured.  Normally, if Windows is installed after Linux, it over-writes the MBR or bootsector of the drive installing its own BCD.

Starting the service at the right time can be achieved running service psd start from Startup Applications.  Where can I put the service psd stop command?\nI've tried using session-cleanup-script in /etc/lightdm.conf, but that seems to run too late.\n\nA: The well-known Upstart event emitted when the desktop is shutting down is \"desktop-end\" (and there is also a corresponding \"desktop-start\"). Hence, something like the following should work:\nmkdir -p ~/.config/upstart/\ncat <<EOT|tee ~/.config/upstart/psd.conf\nstart on desktop-start\nstop on desktop-end\n\nexec psd\n\nEOT\n\nNote: you'll need to change that exec line to the command to start the psd daemon. Alternatively, you could create a job without an exec stanza and instead call commands to start and stop the daemon like this:\npost-start exec command-to-start-psd\npre-stop exec command-to-stop-psd\n\nI've never used psd, but your question seems to suggest it is running as root?

The only remaining prompt is the one shown in the text below, which prompts me to unmount mounted partitions.  The annoying part is it doesn't matter to me whether I choose yes or no, so the whole prompt is pointless for my application.  Additionally nothing I have tried has prevented this prompt from appearing.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I may prevent this prompt from ever bothering me again?\n\nThe installer has detected that the following disks have mounted partitions:\n/dev/sda\nDo you want the installer to try to unmount the partitionson these disks before continuing?  If you leave them mounted you will not be able to create, delete, or resize partitions on these disks, but you may be able to install to existing partitions there.\nUnmount partitions that are in use?\n\n\nA: This is similar to the line of thinking from another answer but with a complete tested code example.\nI was running into the same issue and finally by luck happened upon a set of slides that allowed me to automate this and there was an accompanying code repository with the full preseed file. https://github.com/uweplonus/adia-install/blob/master/initrd/preseed.cfg#L3\nMany people suggest using preseed/early_command umount /media/* but this hasn't worked for quite some time due to the timing of when the preseed portion runs compared to the partitioning.\nThe correct way to do this is to add the following anywhere in your preseed file that is referenced by the boot command.\nUSBDEV=$(list-devices usb-partition | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)./\\1/\");\\\nBOOTDEV=$(list-devices disk | grep -v \"$USBDEV\" | head -1);\\\ndebconf-set partman-auto/disk $BOOTDEV;\\\ndebconf-set grub-installer/bootdev $BOOTDEV; \\\numount /media || true;\n\n\nA: I don't have much to any experience about modifying the installation of Ubuntu.\nBut the most easiest (and possibly safest) thing would be to automatically umount every /dev/sdXY that is currently mounted, except the one with mount point at /. I've constructed the following bash command:\numount LC_ALL=en_US.UTF8 mount | grep -P '^/dev/sd' | grep -v 'on / type' | awk '{print $1}'\n\nTo explain how it works, I'll split it up command by command:\n\n\n*\n\n*LC_ALL=en_US.UTF8 mount lists the currently mounted drives in the following format, forcing an English locale:\n/dev/devicefile on mountpoint type filesystem (mount options)\n\ne.g.\n/dev/sda2 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\n\n\n*| grep -P '^/dev/sd' lists the currently mounted deviced and takes every line from it which starts with /dev/sd, i.e. filtering for every solid disk device.\n\n*| grep -v 'on / type' removes the live system root partition from that selection, so you won't unmount the installer itself ;)\n\n*awk '{print $1}' Splits the single lines using any whitespace as delimiter, and returns the first element of the split line, which is the udev device file, so the output will look something like this:\n/dev/sda1\n/dev/sdb1\n\nThis output is finally passed to umount (must be run as root), which unmounts those partitions, allowing a safe installation without prompt.\n\nA: Don't have enough reputation to comment, have to post it here.\nDragon788's solution worked for me well until I tried it on empty hard drive.\nIt gave me an error and and waited for input, so it wasn't fully unattended.\nMaybe there's another way, but this helped me:\numount /media || true; \ninstead of \numount /media;\nto supress error.\n", "Q: Gnome On Screen Keyboard appears only in activity search I use a Dell with a touch screen which can be folded into a laptop with Ubuntu 15.04 (Gnome).\nI enabled the Gnome On Screen Keyboard in the Accessibility menu, but the onscreen keyboard appears only when i select the Activities search box.

Either of these commands (see man apt-get).\napt-get autoclean\napt-get clean\n\nIf you don't have /tmp on tmpfs, you may want to delete all the files and directories under /tmp.  A tool like tmpreaper can be used to keep it clean.  You can also set edit /etc/defaults/rcS and uncomment the TMPTIME=0 line to have /tmp cleaned on reboot. \nIf you can't boot fully, you can try booting into recovery mode.  If you can boot that far, you will need to mount the disk in read-write mode before cleaning it up.  Running the command mount -a should mount all the file systems so you can do cleanup.

I don't know how to set-up the account password via terminal.\n\nA: Use passwd. From man passwd:\nDESCRIPTION\n       The passwd command changes passwords for user accounts. A normal user\n       may only change the password for his/her own account, while the\n       superuser may change the password for any account.  passwd also changes\n       the account or associated password validity period.\n\nTo use, run the command passwd. This will attempt to change your password - which you don't want.\nSo to change another user's password, use passwd username. However, your regular user won't have permission to do this - only root can change another user's password.\nAs the man page says:\n A normal user may only change the password for his/her own account\n\nand\nsuperuser may change the password for any account.\n\nSo finally, you need this command:\nsudo passwd username\n\nAnd you will see this:\n$ sudo passwd askubuntu\n  [sudo] password for tim: \n  Enter new UNIX password: \n  Retype new UNIX password: \n  passwd: password updated successfully\n\n\nA: From another point, I would recommend you to use the command adduser instead of useradd.

I now have more than the min requirements but am still having trouble getting the graphics to work once I install the appropriate NVIDIA driver.  (before that it is really slow and graphics seems to be one leading cause) One of the things that remained the same was our monitor so I have been looking at that more carefully. When I use the command xrandr, the results indicate that the connected monitor is DVI-I and that there is no VGA monitors. When I double checked the screen and the back of the computer, both ports are labelled as VGA. \nMy monitor is a Princeton VL1917 (company is gone, I got it second hand and have not been able to locate a manual on line.)\nMy graphics card is Nvidia G72 GEForce 7200 6S 7300E therefore I was using the nvidia-304 driver (attempted to download it NVIDIA AND standard repositories)\nI am using a fresh install of Edubuntu 14.04.\nCurrently I am trying to get a hold of a DVI cable to try.\nAny input would be appreciated.\nUPDATE: Most usage seems to be through the graphics drivers I believe. As I said, this was a fresh install with the following hardware:\nMemory : 2GiB\nProcessor : Intel Core 2 Duo CPU E4600 @ 2.40 GHz x2\nOS type 32 bit\nGraphics GEForce 7200 GS/7300 E\nALSO, when I just tried a DVI cable, the xrandr command now says that the VGA is hooked up and nothing is connected through the DVI...\nInstalling the nvidia 304 with the DVI cable still caused non response/black screen problems\n\nA: I would perhaps look at other causes of slow graphics performance, other than the monitor.\nIt is quite likely that the issue with graphics performance is due to other causes.\nDVI and VGA can readily convert with an appropriate simple adapter.\nTry checking also:\n- CPU performance\n- memory performance\n- the types of apps that manifest slow graphics\n", "Q: Should I alphabetically order the flags in a command as good practice? I know that these two commands do the same thing:\nls -la\nls -al\n\nbut I'm wondering if there is any preference between them. Is it better practice to order them in a certain way?\n\nA: With ls you can hardly go wrong with ordering of options.\nBut be mindful though that other commands can have different responses to options depending on the order.\nAn example is the find command. You will get different results for example between:\n  find . -ls -mtime -1 \n\nAnd \n  find . -mtime -1 -ls\n\n\nA: If what you want to practice is alphabetizing short strings, perhaps. I find two strategies useful: making words (reduces typos) and making sentences (improves understanding). \nFor ls, for instance, I usually use ls -halF because, even with the strange capitalization, I am better at typing halF than something like Falh that isn't a word. \nFor tar, on the other hand, I type tar czvf filename and say (in my head) \"tar Create and Zip, Verbosely For filename\" because that's how I learned what the different letters meant.\n\nA: Like others have answered, it doesn't matter (unless documented otherwise or option arguments take further arguments).\nBut is it preferable to order options alphabetically is debatable.\nPersonally, I find that mnemonics provide more value than strict alphabetic order.  It is easier to remember a set of options when they form a memorable word, for example, consider:\nnetstat -tan\n# alphabetic is good (by chance) in this case\nnetstat -ant\n\nvs:\nnetstat -atn\nnetstat -nta\n\nSo if you find yourself repeating a certain combo of options for a command, you may want to try and rearrange the letters to an order that is easiest for you to remember.\n\nA: It does not really matter* unless a command explicitly mentions. I have came across no reference that gave anything like a guideline how to put the options one after another. So I think for the sake of readability the options can be arranged alphabetically.\n*There is a very very important cavaet that is if any option needs a filename or any other input right after it you need to put it accordingly.\nFor example, the -f option of grep takes a file as input to take the pattern to look for from the input file. You need to give the command as e.g.:\ngrep -cf input.txt file.txt \n\nIf you use it like:\ngrep -fc input.txt file.txt \n\nit will fail as it will use c as a file name.\n\nA: The POSIX conventions define in Guideline 11 and 12 of the Utility Syntax Guidelines that the order \"should not matter\" unless it's not documented for the utility itself.\nThe GNU C Library Reference Manual also honors those POSIX conventions in 25.1.1 Program Argument Syntax Conventions. \nBut notice, there are several utilities that give in some situations strict orders how to perform the parameters (for example find). From the find manpage:\n\nThe -name test comes before the -type test in  order  to  avoid\n         having to call stat(2) on every file.\n\nSometimes the utility complains about the ordering.\n", "Q: Bose USB speakers fail to load driver I've followed several guides to get my speakers working.

Is there a way to find out what is running when I get that start-up error?\n\nA: When swapping hard drives, it almost always happens that the partition UUIDs of the new drive don't match the entry in the filesystem table, if the drive is supposed to be auto-mounted.\nYou can get a list of the current UUID's using this command:\nsudo blkid\n\nNow look into your filesystem table (/etc/fstab) and check whether there is an UUID mismatch.\nIf there indeed is, do the following to fix your auto-mount issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the new drive is already in the fstab, delete orphan entries of the old, replaced drive.\n\n*Else, simply replace the old UUID by the new one obtained from blkid. Make sure you choose the correct matching of UUID and device file. The output of blkid and the install-time generated comments in the fstab might prove helpful.\nThe changes will be applied immediately, i.e. the next mounting or unmounting of a file will rely on the updated fstab.

I have been wanting to switch from Windows to Linux, but I noticed Ubuntu software center charges for some apps. I thought Linux/Ubuntu is a free Open Source!\n\nA: This is a bid discussion, first you shall know what is the meaning of open source and what is meaning of free. Plus you should have some knowledge on licenses and different types of licences.\nIn simple words:\nWhat is open source software?\n\nOpen source software is software whose source code is available for\n  modification or enhancement by anyone.\n\"Source code\" is the part of software that most computer users don't\n  ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change\n  how a piece of software—a \"program\" or \"application\"—works.\n  Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can\n  improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that\n  don't always work correctly.\n\nWhat do you mean by Free?\n\nA program is free software if the program's users have the four\n  essential freedoms:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom\n  0).\n  \n*The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does\n  your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is\n  a precondition for this.\n  \n*The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor\n  (freedom 2).\n  \n*The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others\n  (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance\n  to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a\n  precondition for this.\n  \n\nSelling Free Software\nMany people believe that the spirit of Free software is that you should not charge money for distributing copies of software, or that you should charge as little as possible—just enough to cover the cost. This is a misunderstanding.\n\nThe word “free” has two legitimate general meanings; it can refer\n  either to freedom or to price. When we speak of “free software”, we're\n  talking about freedom, not price. (Think of “free speech”, not “free\n  beer”.) Specifically, it means that a user is free to run the program,\n  change the program, and redistribute the program with or without\n  changes.\nFree programs are sometimes distributed gratis, and sometimes for a\n  substantial price. Often the same program is available in both ways\n  from different places. The program is free regardless of the price,\n  because users have freedom in using it.\nNonfree programs are usually sold for a high price, but sometimes a\n  store will give you a copy at no charge. That doesn't make it free\n  software, though. Price or no price, the program is nonfree because\n  its users are denied freedom.\nSince free software is not a matter of price, a low price doesn't make\n  the software free, or even closer to free. So if you are\n  redistributing copies of free software, you might as well charge a\n  substantial fee and make some money. Redistributing free software is a\n  good and legitimate activity; if you do it, you might as well make a\n  profit from it.\n\n", "Q: What is a good fast CD Audio Ripper for my Lubuntu System?

I have a HP 6200 Compaq pro SFF, so my gpu options were limited but I picked what I thought was the best of them. After installing the GPU, my PC would turn on but the screen stays black (so that kinda eliminates the option of Ubuntu installing the driver as far as I know).

I took the GPU out and scoured the BIOS and found no option to change anything GPU related in there (and it looks like others have had the same problem and just updated the BIOS, but on Windows). I checked the HP update list on Ubuntu's website, but my PC was not listed so I cannot update the BIOS that way either. I browsed through AMD's website, and I couldn't find anything for my particular GPU (although I'm new to linux in general so I could have looked at it and had no idea I was).

Today I tried to install Kali Lunix from a USB drive. I WAS running a dual boot with Ununtu and Windows 8.1. Every time I tried to boot from the USB it would go to a purple screen and I would get impatient and shut my laptop off because it didnt do anything. Later research found out that the screen just black out. I used the windows partition manager to format the Ubuntu partition that I had made and turned it into free space. \nNow when I boot up I get stuck with GRUB. I'm still not able to boot from my USB, and yes, its first on the boot list. I even have exited grub and tried to boot from USB but it just re-opens GRUB. When I choose to boot from my HDD it tells me that can boot from: ubuntu, Windows Boot Manager, and Ubuntu. The last two just boot up windows. ubuntu just boots back up GRUB because I no longer have any Ubuntu files. \nI assume that my laptop still thinks that I have Ubuntu on it. I've tried the Advanced Boot from the Recovery tab in the Windows settings but I cant figure out how to delete the ubuntu and Ubuntu entries. I would really like to remove GRUB w/o formatting my HDD. I don't have a way to back up my windows files because I have over 200Gb of things I need to save. Any help with this issue would be absolutely wonderful. Thanks in advance. \n\nA: From your description, it's apparent that you're running an EFI-based computer. There are several ways to do what you want, but I first want to note a caveat: Some tools (such as Boot Repair, if you activate certain advanced options) move and rename EFI boot loaders in order to work around EFI bugs. If you've used such a tool on your computer in the past, doing the \"right\" thing can actually make matters worse. I don't think that doing as I describe here will do that, but it's possible that this procedure won't work if your files have been moved and renamed. That out of the way, one way to get rid of GRUB on such a system is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Windows using your built-in boot manager.\n\n*Open an Administrator Command Prompt window. In Windows 7, you'd do this by right-clicking the Command Prompt item and selecting \"Run as Administrator.\" This is probably different in Windows 8, though.\n\n*Type mountvol P: /S. This should mount the ESP as P:. (You can change that identifier if you like.)\n\n*Back up the contents of P:. You could do this with xcopy, which copies entire directory trees; or use a command-line Zip utility.\n\n*Type cd P:.\n\n*Explore the files on P:. There should be a directory called EFI\\ubuntu. Delete it. There may be other suspicious files or directories, but don't delete them just yet. Be especially careful to not delete the EFI\\Microsoft directory. Note that you'll need to do all this in the Administrator Command Prompt window, using commands like dir and del.\n\n\nWhen you reboot, the computer should boot straight to Windows. If it doesn't, you can go back in and review any other files or directories. Most Windows machines have an EFI\\Microsoft directory on the ESP, and possibly a directory for the computer's manufacturer, but that's it. Anything else is suspect, especially if it's got a Linux-related name -- for instance, if EFI\\fedora is present, it's likely to be the boot loader from a leftover Fedora installation.\nThere are alternatives to this approach. For instance, you could use EasyUEFI in Windows or efibootmgr in an emergency Linux boot to change the boot order. Many EFIs provide similar functionality in their built-in setup utilities, but the details of how to use these tools varies from one machine to another. Re-ordering the boot options may pose slightly less risk of doing something catastrophically wrong than deleting the Ubuntu files from the ESP, but it also won't fully \"get rid of\" GRUB, in the sense that GRUB will still be on the hard disk.\nNote also that there's a possibility that GRUB is installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, in which case the easiest and safest solution is to disable this support. Many Ubuntu installation instructions recommend enabling this support, but that's a Bad Idea, IMO.

Instead of running the full form of this command:\ngit clone https://git.wikimedia.org/git/mediawiki/extensions/Math.git\n\nis there a way to define this variable mw such that git understands it? \n\nA: Not that I know of, but you could define them as Bash variables:\nMW=\"https://git.wikimedia.org/git/mediawiki/extensions\"\ngit clone $MW/Math.git\n\nTo make that definition stick, you'd need to lodge it in somewhere like ~/.bashrc (which runs when each Bash session loads).\n\nRinzwind's idea in the comments is sort of the reverse of mine: create function or script that calls git and treat the Math as a variable for it. Again, this is something you can just enter into a Bash session and test, and then keep in ~/.bashrc:\nfunction mw {\n    git clone https://git.wikimedia.org/git/mediawiki/extensions/$1.git\n}\n\nmw Math\n\nOr keep it as a script in ~/bin/mw (and chmod +x it):\n#!/bin/sh\ngit clone https://git.wikimedia.org/git/mediawiki/extensions/$1.git\n\nIf you have to create ~/bin/ that won't be added to the path until you open a new Bash session.\n\nA: That seems exactly what a remote does inside a repository:\n$ git init ttt\nInitialized empty Git repository in /tmp/user/1000/home-tmp/ttt/.git/\n$ cd ttt \n$ git remote\n$ git remote add mw https://git.wikimedia.org/git/mediawiki/extensions\n$ git remote                                                          \nmw\n$ git remote --verbose \nmw      https://git.wikimedia.org/git/mediawiki/extensions (fetch)\nmw      https://git.wikimedia.org/git/mediawiki/extensions (push)\n\nBut normally, like in this case, remotes are part of a repository configuration.\nNote: the global remote does not work with clone - so it does not really fit the question. \nWhat you need is a globaly defined remote.\nTechnically I see no reason against that - and it seems to basically work:\nMove the configuration section for a remote created in some (even empty) repository to the global configuration:\nRemove the section from ttt/.git/config:\n[remote \"mw\"]\n    url = https://git.wikimedia.org/git/mediawiki/extensions\n    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/mw/*\n\n$ git remote --verbose                                                \n\nand insert it into ~/.gitconfig:\n$ git remote --verbose\nmw      https://git.wikimedia.org/git/mediawiki/extensions (fetch)\nmw      https://git.wikimedia.org/git/mediawiki/extensions (push)\n\n", "Q: Container namespace isn't visible in ip netns list I wonder why we can't see the namespaces created by lxc-create on the output of \"ip netns list\"\nFor example I create a namespace like below\nlxc-create -t download -n cont1 -- -d ubuntu -r trusty -a amd64\n\nI don't see this on \"ip netns list\" however if I add a namespace myself,\nroot@lin:~# ip netns add test\n\nroot@lin:~# ip netns list\ntest\n\nit is visible.\ncontainers use namespaces but here namespaces created lxc-create are hidden from admin user?

When I shut down from Windows and start the laptop, I get the GRUB menu and can select between booting with Windows and Ubuntu. However, after I shut down from Ubuntu and start, directly Windows opens.\nHow can I fix this?\nHere’s how I installed Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*I used a 64-bit iso.\n\n*I disabled Fast Startup and hibernation in Windows. \n\n*I left SecureBoot enabled while installing Ubuntu in UEFI mode. I\nset Secure Boot Mode to ‘Custom’ in the BIOS Settings.\n\n*I created free space for Ubuntu from within Windows.\n\n*While installing from a LiveUSB, I manually created partitions for\n/, /home and swap. I did not create a /boot partition. \n\n*I selected the ‘Device for bootloader information’ as the only hard\ndisk on my laptop. I did not select a specific partition. Also, I\ndid not create an EFI System partition as described in  Ubuntu UEFI\nGuide  because it recommends having only one ESP per disk.\n\n\nDual Boot did not work. Then, I disabled SecureBoot and ran the following command on Windows:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nAnd the GRUB menu started showing every time after I had shut down from windows. But whenever I shut down from Ubuntu and start, it directly boots Windows.\nI did consult the following threads and pages:\nHow to fix dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04 on a Sony Vaio?,\nUbuntu UEFI Guide,\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nHere are some of the possible solutions I found and need advice on which of them to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu and this time create a /boot partition. Then run Boot Repair. \n\n*manually copy the ubuntu Boot directory in place of the \\EFI\\Boot Directory, and rename shimx64.efi to \\EFI\\Boot\\bootx64.efi (not \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi ), like in this guide: http://www.slideshare.net/Tinydile/vaio-pro13-win8ubuntu1310uefi.\n(I’ve never used xTerm or rEFInd. So I do not understand what the commands in this guide are exactly for and whether this guide solves the problem.)\nCan somebody please explain what is causing this problem and how I should fix it? I'm confused because dual-boot does work, just not straight after shutting down from Ubuntu.\nThank you in advance. \n\nA: Sony VAIOs are pretty notorious for having flaky firmware. I recommend you first check Sony's site for an update and, if one is available, install it.\nIf that doesn't help, start investigating your firmware boot order options using efibootmgr in Ubuntu. You'll see something roughly like this:\n$ sudo efibootmgr\nBootCurrent: 0000\nTimeout: 0 seconds\nBootOrder: 0000,0003,0007,2003,0001,2001,2002\nBoot0000* rEFInd (direct)\nBoot0001* Lenovo Recovery System\nBoot0003* ubuntu\nBoot0007* Windows Boot Manager\nBoot2001* EFI USB Device\nBoot2002* EFI DVD/CDROM\nBoot2003* EFI Network\n\nThe details will differ, of course. Look at the BootCurrent and BootOrder lines; the numbers refer to the various Boot#### entries. In this example, the BootOrder is set to rEFInd (direct) first, followed by ubuntu, and so on; and the system actually booted (BootCurrent) via rEFInd. Note that the numbers are actually hexadecimal, although this example doesn't show any over-9 digits.\nCompare the output of this command when you reboot from Windows vs. when you reboot from Ubuntu. Does the BootOrder change depending on how you boot? Also, does rebooting from Windows automatically change the BootOrder back (and fix the boot-time behavior)?\nIf the BootOrder is changing, you might try setting it back to the way it should be in Ubuntu. Use the -o option to efibootmgr, as in:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0,3,7\n\nChange the numbers to match your Boot#### options, of course. If this works on a one-time basis, you can create a shutdown script to do it automatically every time you shut down, as described here:\nExecute a script upon logout/reboot/shutdown in Ubuntu\nIf that doesn't help, then there are possible solutions that involve renaming and moving boot loader files. Boot Repair can do this semi-automatically via an option on its Advanced menu (I don't recall the exact name, though; it's something to do with backing up and renaming files). I'd use this option only as a last resort, though; it's an ugly hack that doesn't always work and that can create confusion down the road if/when you need to re-install an OS or otherwise manipulate the boot loaders.\nI do not recommend re-installing Ubuntu as a solution. It didn't work the first time and it's unlikely to do any better the second time. The presence or absence of a /boot partition is almost certainly irrelevant to your problem.\n", "Q: Use sed command to apply a condition to check if a pattern has been matched I am searching for the string ::=BEGIN and I want to apply a condition to check if the word has been found.\nSo, what I mean is something along these lines: \nif (sed command does find a match for \"::=BEGIN\")\nthen i=1 \nelse i=0\n\nAlso, I want the 1 (for yes found) and 0 (not found) to be put into the variable \"i\".\nPlease help me out. Also provide a explanation to the solution! Thanks!\n\nA: grep does that job well enough. \n$ echo \"::=BEGIN\" > testfile1.txt\n\n$ grep \"::=BEGIN\" -q testfile1.txt && echo \"FOUND\"\nFOUND\n\n$ grep \"::=BEGIN\" -q testfile1.txt && echo \"FOUND\" || echo \"NOTFOUND\"\nFOUND\n\n$ grep \"whever\" -q testfile1.txt && echo \"FOUND\" || echo \"NOTFOUND\"\nNOTFOUND\n\nWhat the code does is simply running a quiet search within subshell. && , or logical AND operand, checks if the first command succeeded, and if it did, then it runs echo \"FOUND\" . || checks if that echo has been run, i.e., if we found anything. Second echo runs only if the first command failed.\nHere's an awk version:\n$ awk '{i=\"NOTFOUND\";if($0~/::=BEGIN/) i=\"FOUNDIT\";exit } END { print i}' testfile1.txt\nFOUNDIT\n\n$ awk '{i=\"NOTFOUND\";if($0~/whatevs/) i=\"FOUNDIT\";exit } END { print i}' testfile1.txt\nNOTFOUND\n\nBasic idea here is to set i to NOTFOUND, and if we find the string - change it to FOUNDIT . At the end after the first set of has finished processing file, we will print i, and it will tell us if we found something or not.\nEdit: In the comment you mentioned that you want to place the result into a variable. Shell already provides a variable that reports exit status of the previous command, $0. Exit status 0 means success, everything else - fail. For instance,\n$ grep \"::=BEGIN\" -q testfile1.txt  \n$ echo $?\n0\n\nIf you want to use exit status in a variable, you can do it like so : MYVAR=$(echo $?). Remember , $? report exit status of previous command. So you must use this right after the grep command. \nIf you want to still use my earlier awk and grep one-liners, you can use same trick MYVAR=$() and place whatever command you want between the braces. The output will get assigned to variable MYVAR.\n\nA: With a GNU sed (as is installed by default on any Ubuntu system):\n{ sed -n '/::=BEGIN/Q 1'; i=$?; } <infile\n\nSome facts about this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*sed Quits input just as soon as the very first match is found anywhere in the file - which means it does not waste any more time continuing to read the infile.\n\n*sed returns in its exit code the numeric value 0 or 1 depending on whether it couldn't/could find the addressed regexp.\n\n*$i is set to sed's return upon exit.\n\n*The { grouping ; } is used to robustly handle any possible redirection error - $i is not set in the case the shell cannot open the file at all, thus avoiding false positives.\nThis probably shouldn't be preferred to grep -q, though, which can basically also do all of the above (if in reverse), do it POSIXly, and usually faster.\nThe already given grep -q answer is very good, but, a little terser:\ngrep -q pattern ./infile; i=$((!$?))\n\n\nA: You can use this:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    case \"$line\" in *::=BEGIN*) i=1 && break;;         \n                               *) i=0\n    esac\ndone <file.txt\n\nThis will search the file file.txt line by line and if a match of ::=BEGIN found it  will set the variable i=1 and exit.

The last release affected by it is \"Hardy\" so this does not apply to 14.04 LTS nor 14.10 nor 15.04. So yes this particular bug has been solved. \nBy the way: the kernel nowadays handles the \"laptop-mode\" tools they are referring to.  Nevertheless this will still work as a tool to check the health of your disk:\n\nFirst install smartmontools to be able to query your harddrive :\n$ sudo aptitude install smartmontools\n\nTo find your Load_Cycle_Count do this (the last number is the number\n  we are interested in) :\n$ sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | grep Load_Cycle_Count\n\n\nIn my opinion there is nothing to worry about. \n\nA: Here's my two cents on the issue. The article you posted says:\nhe following things might cause aggressive power management :\n\n1) your (laptop) harddrive firmware might have aggressive power\n  management defaults (operating system independent)\n\nOS independent, related to the hardware, hence Ubuntu has nothing to do with this\n\n2)  your (laptop) BIOS might set your harddrive to use aggressive power management (operating system independent)\n\nSame thing as above ^\n\n3)   you might have enabled laptop-mode in /etc/default/acpi-support (disabled by default) which will set your harddrive to use aggressive\n  power management\n\nI've looked through that file and there's nothing that I could see that could harm hard drive. \nAlso, laptop-mode's purpose is to allow the hard drive spin down for longer periods of time. I think the author of that article does not quite understand the purpose of laptop mode.\n", "Q: What is the differences between &> and 2>&1 There are two forms of redirection the standard output and standard error into standard output. But which one is better? and why the &> is considered the perfect?\nI can't find what is the differences so that many tutorials and even bash manual state that  &> is better! \nSo Why shall I use &> and not 2>&1\nMainly using bash shell\n\nEDIT: Thanks for commentors \nOnly >& works in csh or tcsh\nIn ksh only 2>&1 works.\ndash use >file 2>&1 redirection only\nThen which one to use to ensure my script is compatible with other systems whatever the used shells are!\n\nA: \nSo Why shall I use &> and not 2>&1\n\n2>&1 is standard Bourne/POSIX shell.\n&> is a bash extension and not de jure standard.\nIf you write scripts using bash extensions, sooner or later you're going to encounter head-scratching failures with cryptic syntax error messages because they're being run in a standard shell.\n\nA: From Bash Reference Manual -> 3.6.4 Redirecting Standard Output and Standard Error:\n\nThis construct allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and\n  the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be redirected to the\n  file whose name is the expansion of word.\nThere are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard\n  error:\n&>word\n\nand\n>&word\n\nOf the two forms, the first is preferred. This is semantically\n  equivalent to\n>word 2>&1\n\nWhen using the second form, word may not expand to a number or ‘-’. If\n  it does, other redirection operators apply (see Duplicating File\n  Descriptors below) for compatibility reasons.\n\nAlso good to refer to Greg's wiki on Input And Output -> 4.2. File Descriptor Manipulation:\n\nFor convenience, Bash also makes yet another form of redirection\n  available to you. The &> redirection operator is actually just a\n  shorter version of what we did here [ 2>&1 ]; redirecting both\n  stdout and stderr to a file.\n\n\nA: Bash's man page mentions there's two ways to redirect stderr and stdout:\n&> file  and >& file. Now, notice that it says both stderr and stdout. \nIn case of this >file 2>&1 we are doing redirection of stdout (1) to file, but then also telling stderr(2) to be redirected to the same place as stdout ! So the purpose may be the same, but the idea slightly different. In other words \"John, go to school; Suzzie go where John goes\". \nWhat about preference ? &> is  a bash thing. So if you're porting a script, that won't do it. But if you're 100% certain your script will be only working on system with bash - then there's no preference\nHere's an example with dash , the Debian Amquist Shell which is Ubuntu's default.\n$ grep \"YOLO\" * &> /dev/null\n$ grep: Desktop: Is a directory\ngrep: Documents: Is a directory\ngrep: Downloads: Is a directory\ngrep: Music: Is a directory\ngrep: Pictures: Is a directory\ngrep: Public: Is a directory\ngrep: Templates: Is a directory\ngrep: Videos: Is a directory\ngrep: YOLO: Is a directory\ngrep: bin: Is a directory\n\nAs you can see, stderr is not being redirected\nTo address your edits in the question,  you can use if statement to check $SHELL variable and change redirects accordingly\nBut for most cases > file 2>&1 should work\n\nIn more technical terms, the form [integer]>&word is called Duplicating Output File Descriptor, and is a feature specified by POSIX Shell Command Language standard, which is supported by most POSIX-compliant and Brourne-like shells.\nSee also What does & mean exactly in output redirection?\n\nA: I would generally recommend following the Bourne-again SHell's way of doing things, since bash is arguably the most popular Unix shell out there. Bash typically uses either &> or 2>&1. IMHO, neither is \"perfect\", so I recommend forgetting about that nonsense. Realistically, which one you should use depends on what you are trying to do.\n2>&1 merges stderr with stdout, which can be useful if, for example, you want to pipe stderr text. So, for example, if you want to see if a program prints a certain stderr message, but don't want your screen filled with (presumably) unimportant garbage, you could do something like program 2>&1 | grep crashed, which will search the stdout and stderr from a program called \"program\" for the word \"crashed\".\nOn the other hand, if you don't want a program to print anything at all, you could simply run program &> /dev/null, which will redirect both stderr and stdout to /dev/null, a special file which magically makes things disappear. Or, if you want to save the output of a program (perhaps to report a bug or something), you could redirect both stderr and stdout to a file: program &> log.txt will redirect all data to a file called \"log.txt\". If you wanted to, you could redirect the stdout and stderr via program 2> log.txt > log.txt or program 2>&1 | cat > log.txt, both of which would have the same effect as using &>. If you do something like program 2>&1 > file, only stdout will be redirected, but stderr can still be piped to another program, such as cat, which could be redirected as shown above. However, typing &> is easier than any of the above examples, since it involve typing fewer characters (and it's a bit easier for human beings to read). Do note that program 2> log.txt > log.txt might be more likely to work on non-bash shells.\nPS: if you are worried about people using other shells, there's something you can add to be first line of your script called a \"magic number\", or \"shebang\". This is essentially a way to make sure other computers (particularly those running Unix-like operating systems) know which program to use to execute a script. Different scripts use different shebangs. A shebang for a bash script looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nIf you use the above as the first line of a given script, bash will generally be used to execute said script. This will make it much more difficult for someone to accidentally execute the script with the wrong shell.\nPS: I'm not going to lie: up till now, I didn't know one could use >&, but, as far as bash goes, it seems to do the same as &>. You learn something new everyday.\n", "Q: Suspected rootkit, what should I do? I inherited ubuntu 12.4 server and I want to check it for possible rootkits/modifications. Is there a way to test all executable/library files for modification (test if currently installed files are exactly the same as one from repository)\nSince this server is working for long time, tools like tripwire does not make sense and I already used rkhunter and manually tested all configuration files and they all looks OK, problem is if something is hidden in kernel/modules/modified executables (clamav didn't find anything).\nany suggestions are welcomed\n\nA: Either consider OSSSEC HIDS or some other IDS/IPS system on your network, or a fresh reinstallation of the server.\nUnless you have a known good rkhunter scan or similar to base a comparison from, trying to determine if you have a root kit is nigh impossible without monitoring traffic on your network and such to determine intrusions (and that would be Snort or OSSSEC HIDS like the comments say).  Then watching the output events which trigger will give you an idea if malware or root kits are there and trying to ping out to elsewhere.\nIf you suspect a root kit though, you may want to just start anew, but if that server is critical to all work processes then you need to consider what other issues could exist and whether the cost of a potential security hole or breach there is acceptable to you or the organization,  versus the cost of downtime while you reinstall the server, reinstall services, put data back on, etc.\n", "Q: Broken links after kernel upgrade After running:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nAnd upgrading my kernel as well as some other stuff and then running this twice with a reboot after each running:\nsudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean\n\nI got this error the second time I ran it:\nnk /vmlinuz.old is a damaged link\nRemoving symbolic link vmlinuz.old\n you may need to re-run your boot loader[grub]\nThe link /initrd.img.old is a damaged link\nRemoving symbolic link initrd.img.old\n you may need to re-run your boot loader[grub]\n\nWhat does this mean and do I need to do anything about it?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\n\nKernel Version Information:\n3.19.0-20-generic\n\n\nA: Run\nsudo update-grub\n\nIf there is no warning shown, there is no problem.\nIf you reboot now, grub might not find the kernel.\n", "Q: ls command by default is showing one line per file? How to change it? \nWhen I call the ls command, I expect it to show all the files/directories in the current directory, attempting to fit as many as possible on each line. But, somehow it is showing one file per line. How to change that behavior?\n\nA: Are you sure you are not mixing lowercase L with 1?\nls -l (list long) shows a long list of 1 file per line but with as many lines as the terminal shows.\nIf \"ls\" is the only command that does this you might have used the \"1\" (digit one) option somewhere. [man ls][1]: \n\n-1   Prints one entry per line of output.\n\n\nYour command could be aliased to using a \"1\". Check if it is with ...\nalias ls \n\nAnd to remove that use\nunalias ls\n\nand check again. If so find the alias (probably .bashrc) and fix it.\n\nA: There could be a file with a very long name, consisting mainly of spaces, in the directory. This will force the file list into a single column. To test for the presence of such a file name, do this:\nfind . -name *\\ \\ \\ *\nThis will find filenames with three or more consecutive spaces.\n\nA: use the command\nls | tr \"\\n\" \" \" \n\nThis will remove the new line and thus will list all files on the same line.\nYou can make an alias to this command and add it to your .bashrc so you can use the alias instead.\ngedit .bashrc\n\nadd the following line:\nalias lll=' ls | tr \"\\n\" \" \" '\n\nSave an close then source your .bashrc\nsource .bashrc\n\nNow you can use this alias by running the lll alias command.\n", "Q: Command not found when trying to execute *.bin file Downloaded genymotion and trying to access it by following their instructions.

I moved it to home and right clicked and selected Allow executing file as program from the permissions tab of the properties, followed the previous steps adding the directory I was in as the install folder, and it worked.

You also seem to be using flawed logic. An exit status of 0 means the command succeeded, not that it failed. If what you want is to print failed if your file doesn't match the query string, all you need is:\ngrep -q \"::=BEGIN\" /home/erawson/bin/HP/adaptec.mib || echo \"failed\"\n\nIf you want to print failed if the file matches the string, use this:\ngrep -q \"::=BEGIN\" /home/erawson/bin/HP/adaptec.mib && echo \"failed\"\n\nThere's no need to save the exit status and no need for an if/else check.\n\nA: You just need an extra pair of parentheses:\ngrep -q \"::=BEGIN\" </home/erawson/bin/HP/adaptec.mib\nif ((\"$?\" = \"0\")); then\n    echo \"failed\"\nelse\n    exit\nfi\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The correct arithmetic operator syntax is ((\n\n*Also as you are just using the exit code $?, there is no need to save it in another variable, you can use it directly.\nThis can be further simplified as:\nif grep -q \"::=BEGIN\" </home/erawson/bin/HP/adaptec.mib; then\n    echo \"failed\"\nelse\n    exit\nfi\n\n\nA: As I understand, your requirement is, \nif you get output for grepping string \"::=BEGIN\", you want to echo \"failed\"..right??\nAnd I'm not sure why you have used \";\" after if...again used \"then\"\nyou may try the following\n\nif [ -n `grep -q \"::=BEGIN\" /home/erawson/bin/HP/adaptec.mib` ]\nthen\n        echo \"failed\"\nelse\n        exit\nfi\n\nHope this helps!!

Try to grep for kill or dm - you should see something for them.\n\n*You are seeing all of them. This is because it's giving it as lots of individual outputs, not just 1 thing.\nEach of those lines is printed separately, and it's as stderr not stdout. You have 2 options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Redirect to a file, like this:\nservice --status-all > allout.txt 2>&1\n\nAll the output will be saved in a file called allout.txt. You can then cat and grep that:\ncat allout.txt | grep worker\n\nThat can be combined to one command:\nservice --status-all > allout.txt 2>&1 && cat allout.txt | grep worker\n\n\n*Redirect stderr to /dev/null, and grep stdout:\nservice --status-all 2>&1 > /dev/null | grep worker\n\nBoth of these give the same output:\ntim@Hairy14:~$ service --status-all > allout.txt 2>&1 && cat allout.txt | grep kill\n [ ? ]  killprocs\n\nand\ntim@Hairy14:~$ service --status-all 2>&1 > /dev/null | grep kill\n [ ? ]  killprocs\n\n\nA: Use:\nservice --status-all |& grep worker\n\nservice --status-all | grep vnstat\n\n", "Q: Sed script to print a variable based on user input I want to write a sed script that reads user input, and if the variable matches a predefined string it should print welcome, otherwise it should print sorry.\nFor example, if user inputs \"Hello\" the system should print \"Welcome\", if not it should print \"Sorry\".\n\nA: #!/bin/bash\nread -p \"Enter some input:\" USERINPUT\n(grep \"$USERINPUT\" -q inputfile.txt ) && echo \"Welcome\" || echo \"Sorry\"\n\n\nA: If you are trying to get input of a password, that is certainly not how to do it.\nFirst, the comparison password should be stored as a hash. Create that with md5sum for example:\necho hello | md5sum\n\ngives\nb1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184  -\n\nNow to get the input, we can use @Serg's answer, slightly modified.

It never comes to a full stop.\nI tried updating Ubuntu, rebooted and I re-installed my servers on local test-images (I use Puppet). Nothing makes any difference. I also tried searching for bugs relating to this without avail.\nDoes anyone know how I can fix this problem? I'd like to be able to run sudo service nginx stop and have all nginx processes stopped as a result.\n\nA: It seems you nginx server is handle by an upstart process.\nLook in the /etc/init folder, and check if there is not a file which handles nginx.\ngrep -r nginx /etc/init\n\nThen edit this file, and remove the respawn option in the config file.\n\nA: You can stop nginx process using sudo nginx -s quit\nYou can see in /etc/init/nginx\n\nA: I had the same problem, when I wanted to update my letsencrypt certificates with a temporary webserver by certbot: every time, i stopped nginx with\nservice stop nginx\n\nafter some seconds it restarted automatically so when it came to serving the proof of my domain certbot, port 443 was already in use by the respawned nginx.\nI was really in a hurry to fix this, so I started a really dirty workaround, but it worked:\nwhile true; do service nginx stop; sleep 2; done\n\nNow I was able to refresh my certificates and find out later, how to stop nginx for good in a more correct way ;)\n", "Q: gnome: How to set lv3:rwin_switch xkb option in tweak tools I set my keyboard layout like this:\nsetxkbmap -layout us -variant altgr-intl -option '' -option caps:escape -option altwin:swap_alt_win lv3:rwin_switch\n\nwhich is fine, as long as I do not plugin and plug out an external keyboard,  or hit the \"switch keyboard layout\" key. In these cases I have to go to the terminal and redo this command.\nI would like this options to be more permanent, so I try to set them in the \"tweak tool\".\nBut I cannot find an option, that correspond to \"lv3:rwin_switch\" which sets my lv3 key (for international characters) to my right win key.\nI tried around, but the options are a little confusing. Can this be done in the tweak-tool?\n\nA: Perhaps adding a udev rule to run the same command when keyboard commands may solve the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*First connect your external keyboard, and do lsusb to find the hardware ID. It would look something like \nBus 002 Device 002: ID 04f2:0402 Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd Genius LuxeMate i200 Keyboar. The id is 04f2:0402.\n\n*Then we add a UDEV rule. To edit the file, do sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/00-usb-keyboards.rules, fill the text file with something like\nACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"YOUR_VENDOR(04f2 for me)\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"YOUR_PRODUCT(0402 for me)\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/kbd_udev\", OWNER=\"USERNAME\"\n\nNote that you should change the USERNAME field.\nAnd with this we tell udev to run the script whenever the device with matching vendor and product ID is connected.\n\n*Now we get to the script file /usr/local/bin/kbd_udev, do sudo nano /usr/local/bin/kbd_udev and fill it in with the script below\n#!/bin/bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nsu YOURUSERNAME -c \"setxkbmap -layout us -variant altgr-intl -option '' -option caps:escape -option altwin:swap_alt_win lv3:rwin_switch\" &> /tmp/kbd_temp\n\nAgain, make sure to change YOURUSERNAME with your username.\n\n*After writing the script, you need to make it executable. To do so..\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/kbd_udev\n\n\n*Finally, tell udev to reload it's rules, run udevadm control --reload-rules\n\n*Optional, but you can test to see if the command worked, by looking in the /tmp/ directory. Do cat /tmp/kbd_temp, if there are any errors, you should be able to see them.\n", "Q: What is the thing in KDE that override my locale settings With Kubuntu 14.04, I have got some trouble with the locales. \"Something\" in KDE override my settings (I say in KDE because if I use gnome, I got no problems).\nHere are my settings \n$ cat /etc/default/locale \nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLANGUAGE=\"en\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"fr_FR.UTF-8\"\n\n\n$ cat /etc/environment\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\n\nBut I got (the problem are the \"en_FR.UTF-8\"):\n$ locale\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=en_FR.UTF-8\nLC_TIME=en_FR.UTF-8\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=en_FR.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=en_FR.UTF-8\nLC_NAME=en_FR.UTF-8\nLC_ADDRESS=en_FR.UTF-8\nLC_TELEPHONE=en_FR.UTF-8\nLC_MEASUREMENT=en_FR.UTF-8\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=en_FR.UTF-8\nLC_ALL=\n\nWhat do you think of that?\nThanks!\n\nA: Ok I erased the content of ~/.kde/env/setlocale.sh, and it works!\nTkanks!!\n\nA: Maybe better workaround for this is clearing setlocale.sh and setting it as read only file with: \ncd ~/.kde/env/setlocale.sh\n> setlocale.sh\nchmod 444 setlocale.sh\n\nnow you would be ignoring completely settings in GUI and will have working settings from: \n/etc/default/locale\n\n", "Q: I want to use the latest version of ubuntu How can I install the latest version of ubuntu in my laptop without harming my windows 8.1?\nMy laptop is just two months old and I am all set to receive windows10 and I want to use both.. so help me\n\nA: The best way would be definetly to use VirtualBox without harming your Host OS,although it brings performance problem,DualBoot(Booting on OS selection) would also do the work\n", "Q: How to remove duplicated packages on Ubuntu 15.04?

Here a screenshot. Actually, menu bar changed but I like the \"classic\" way, with \"File, Edit...\". What I did wrong and how I can I fix this?\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n\nA: if you are using GNOME 3, you can access the preferences via the top menu.\nyou should have \"activities\" on the top left corner of your screen. on the right side of activities, you will have gedit. click on it, and you should see the preferences.\n\nA: Read this:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1542489\nI decided to use pluma instead of gedit:\nsudo apt-get install pluma\n\nIt looks just like gedit did about 2 versions ago. This will work fine (for me) until gedit gets straightened out.\n\nA: I had a same problem with applications like LibreOffice 5 and terminal and gedit. Menu bar was missing from both of this applications. It occurred after upgrading Ubuntu to 16.04 from 14.04... I used following two commands and it worked for me...\nWARNING: resets all compiz settings.\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\nsetsid unity\n\nUse above two commands and I hope it will work for you also...\n\nA: Some of gedit's menu items can only be seen when the indicator-appmenu is installed. Try this:\nsudo apt-get install indicator-appmenu\n\nLogout and login again. See if the menu of the gedit application appears on the top of the screen (not on top of the application window). If it does, you should be able to find Preferences option there.\nIf you don't like the menu to appear on the top of the screen (such as I), you may remove it afterward.\nsudo apt-get remove indicator-appmenu\n\nDon't forget to logout and login again.\n", "Q: Desperately looking for Ubuntu14.04 ISO file I have been looking to download Ubuntu 14.04 ISO image file for hours but all what I can find is either 14.04.2 or 14.04.1 releases.\nCould any one give me the links I need ?\nWhy do I want this precise release?

It's just a bunch of updates and bug fixes , and once you install 14.04 and start updating you'r moving to 14.04.2 and 14.04.3 smoothly if we are going to be up to date, so it doesn't matter to just install 14.04.3 and save some time and updates .\n\nA: 14.04.2 will not \"die\" soon. Well it will, but you will have updated to 14.04.3 by then. By updated, I just mean you will see the update manager\nYou will not have to reinstall or anything, it will be automatic. No trouble.\nAlso, all installing 14.04 will do is mean you get 300+ MB of updates. Then it will \"turn into\" 14.04.2.\nSave the time, and install 14.04.2 straight away.\n\nYou may also be a little confused about the LTS nature of Ubuntu 14.04.

I know MAAS is intended for installing cluster nodes.\nBut can MAAS be used for the install of desktop computers, or laptops?\nHow to proceed?\n\nA: Yes, although MAAS is not specifically designed for that purpose it could easily be used to manage a deployment of desktop machines.\nMAAS expects machines to use cloud-init in the boot process, which connects to a metadata source over the network on boot to configure the operating system.\nLinux operating systems and windows servers can run cloud-init.\nMAAS also expects to be able to power on and off each node, which is certainly possible with certain desktop hardware, but not all hardware.  If it has IPMI, then it should work.  Intel has AMT on some of it's hardware that can work, but it is not as reliable.\nBut provided that the power management is reliable and the network is always connected then it would work just like in the data centre with servers.\nThen you have to consider what operating systems you would like to deploy.  Linux desktops would work once you had cloud-init installed into the image.  \nWindows servers would work using the work done by Cloudbase (http://wiki.cloudbase.it/maas).\nI have no knowledge if this also works with standard Windows desktops or not.\nThere is a package for creating CentOS or RH based images available in Launchpad here: https://launchpad.net/maas-image-builder\nAs long as the image boots over the network and has cloud-init package installed, then it should work.\nThere is no cloud-init for Mac OSX as far as I know.\n\nA: Another solution is to use curtinator[a].

Grub Rescue is actually really hard to use, I would advise against using it ever. I would say your best bet is to boot to a usb. The reason it isn't booting to it now is it probably is not configured to in bios (so try changing your bios settings to boot to usb first), or your usb is just being a pain, try reinstalling the os onto the live usb.

I had a 30GB free space and I allocated 29 out of that 30 as primary partition for Ubuntu. I wanted to use the remaining 1GB as my swap area. But once the partition for Ubuntu installation is created, the rest of the free space became unusable. \nI searched through the web and realized that I have already got maximum number of primary partitions in my HDD. Now I need to know that,\n\n\n*\n\n*How to know whether a particular partition is a primary one or a logical one(In this case, I would appreciate if you can provide me a way to know that in Windows environment.).\n\n*Can I convert the partition type into logical from primary?\n\n*If partitions can be converted into logical from primary, how to do so?\n\n*Will it harm my files in the particular partition?\n\n*Finally, If I have a big enough RAM, Do I need to create a swap area.?\n\n\nA: First, if Windows 8 was pre-installed on the computer, it probably used the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which does not suffer from the 4-partition limit of the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system. Therefore, I recommend you check your partition table type. You can do this from an Ubuntu live disk (or your installed Ubuntu, if you've gotten that far) by typing sudo parted /dev/sda print | grep Table. (This assumes you've got just one disk; if you've got more than one disk, do the same for each one, such as /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, and so on.) If the output reads Partition Table: gpt, you're using GPT, and something other than the 4-partition limit is causing you problems; if it reads Partition Table: msdos, then you're using MBR. All this said, your symptom certainly sounds like the MBR 4-partition limit, so I'll assume that's what you're encountering. (Windows 8 may use MBR if you installed it or re-installed yourself, especially on an older computer.)\nIn Linux, if you type sudo parted /dev/sda print, you'll see your partitions. Primaries are numbered 1-4 and logical partitions are numbered 5 and up. The same is true if you use sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda. In GParted, the same numbering applies, but you'll also see the representation in the GUI shows logical partitions contained in the pale blue extended partition. This is easy to overlook, but it's pretty clear once you know about it. Third-party Windows tools should make this clear, too, although I'm not familiar enough with any of them to give you details. Unfortunately, the stock GUI tools that come with Windows are as clear as mud about this, so I don't recommend you use them for this purpose. Also, do not use the stock Windows tools to create partitions, particularly if that would bring their number over 4; these tools tend to convert from a plain-vanilla MBR setup to a proprietary Windows format atop MBR, and that proprietary format is essentially unusable for Ubuntu.\nAs to converting partitions from one type to another, it is possible, using the fixparts program that comes with Ubuntu in the gdisk package. See its online documentation for details. (Note: I'm the author of FixParts.) The big caveat is that converting to logical form requires a small gap before each to-be-logical partition. Given your layout, you might need to slightly shrink the partition before your Linux partition to make this work. Some third-party Windows tools can also reportedly do this conversion, but I'm not familiar enough with them to give details. There is a Windows version of FixParts, too. Whenever you muck with partition tables, there's some risk of catastrophic data loss, so you should definitely do this only after backing up important data. That said, the primary-to-logical conversion is simple compared to some (such as partition resizing, especially resizing from the front of the partition).\nSwap space is optional for most purposes. Today, it's most useful if you want to perform suspend-to-disk operations, in which case you need at least as much swap space as you have RAM. It's also useful if you've got relatively little RAM, and to help the kernel improve performance by allocating RAM efficiently. (It can swap out programs you haven't used in ages, freeing up the RAM for use by caches.) You can set up a swap file rather than a swap partition, if you so desire.\n\nA: You can boot from Ubuntu LiveCD, run Gparted and get full information about your partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can see it in gparted or Windows Disk Formatter\n\n*You can convert a primary partition to a logical using Fixparts but it is not a straightforward procedure. And there is a risk to lose your data. Since you have to backup it either way, it is much easier to remove a primary partition and a new one.\n\n*See p.2.\n\n*See p.2 and p.3\n\n*You can get all kind of answers. But firstly it depends on what is \"big enough RAM\".\nAlso if you have HDD partitioned as GPT, then you can create only primary partitions. You do not need to worry about extended or logical ones.\nI suggest that you boot from LiveCD and get a screenshot of gparted.\nThen you can ask another question about practical issues you will face. Attaching the screenshot will be very helpful.\n", "Q: Link to restart from Windows to Ubuntu I have standard dual-boot system: Ubuntu and Windows.

I've got \"Windows as default\" config by modifying GRUB via grub-customizer (it's safer in my opinion), after that copy Windows grub.cfg to your desired directory\nAfter that, open notepad and insert:\ncopy e:\\boot\\grub\\grub.cfg /y e:\\home\\user\\Grubshift\\backup\ncopy e:\\home\\user\\Grubshift\\ubuntudefault\\grub.cfg /y e:\\boot\\grub\nshutdown /r /t 0\n\n/y - option of copy command, suppresses prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an existing destination file\n/r /t 0 - options of shutdown, 1. means reboot, 2. means immediately, without ugly messages popping up \nModify the path accordingly !!!\n\n\n*\n\n*Save that file (I've used UTF-8) and change extension to *.bat\n\n*Create Desktop shortcut for shift.bat, right click on shorctur --> properties--> shortcut tab --> Run:minimized (that will get rid of CMD popping up)\n\n\nI have tried this at least 8 times, setting Windows as default \nwith grub-customizer ... \nI'm not saying it's safe, but HEY!, we are messing with bootloader... that isn't safe\nWhen it's fully working, we can get rid of GRUB menu completely, because it will always boot into right OS...\n\nA: You don't need to modify /boot/grub/grub.cfg like Michal Hagara suggested.

Also, L: must not be already taken.\n\n*save it as e.g. reboot-linux.bat\n\n*you can right-click on bat and select run as administrator to execute it \n\n\nShell script for reboot from linux to windows:\nsudo sed -i -e '/next_entry/c\\next_entry=2' /boot/grub/grubenv\nsudo reboot\n\n\n\n*\n\n*replace next_entry=2 with whatever your windows entry is. \n\n*save it as e.g. ~/reboot_windows and mark as executable: chmod +x ~/reboot_windows\n\nA: I use Arch instead of Ubuntu but the GRUB configuration should be the same.\nWhat I don't really like about the previous anwsers is that they:\n\n*\n\n*either involve editing the grub.cfg file directly, which is intended for permanent changes\n\n*or edit the grubenv in a way that corrupts the GRUB environment block, which results in warnings on Linux boot and breaks the grub-editenv command\n\nGRUB setup\nSo first of all you need to setup GRUB to remeber the last system booted to (it's convenient for reboots anyway):\n\n*\n\n*enter GRUB_DEFAULT=saved and GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true in\n/etc/default/grub\n\n*update config using sudo update-grub (on Arch it's grub-mkconfig)\n\nLinux side\nThere's this convenient command called grub-reboot which lets you one-shot boot into Windows. Very handy. Note that this keeps the last saved entry in GRUB, so when you go like Linux>grub-reboot to Windows>Windows>reboot it will reboot you back to Linux. To override this (unwanted IMO) behavior add another command afterward like this:\ngrub-reboot $name\ngrub-editenv /boot/grub/grubenv set saved_entry=$name\n\nwhere $name is the name of Windows as it appears in GRUB. I explain it in detail below. After running these commands reboot the system.\nWindows side\nSo I decided to investigate what the Linux script does. It calls grub-editenv and sets the value of next_entry to the desired OS. I spent a few hours doing trial and error editing the grubenv file trying to replicate the result and managed to come up with a solution. It turns out that the GRUB environment block should always be kept exactly 1024 bytes long, that's why there are # signs at the end by default. Here's my PowerShell script. It might be a bit verbose but it gets the job done correctly.\nfunction Get-ArrLength {\n    param (\n        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true,ValueFromPipeline=$true)]\n        [string[]]$arr\n    )\n\n    $text = [string]::Join(\"`n\", $arr)\n    ($text | Measure-Object -Character).Characters\n} \n\nmountvol P: /S\nP:\ncd grub\ncp grubenv grubenv.bak\n$name = \"Arch Linux\"\n$name_len = ($name | Measure-Object -Character).Characters\n$arr = cat grubenv\n$original_length = Get-ArrLength $arr\n\n$arr = $arr -replace \"next_entry=\",\"next_entry=$name\"\nforeach ($a in $arr) {\n    if ($a -match \"saved_entry=\") {\n        $arr[$arr.IndexOf($a)] = \"saved_entry=$name\"\n    }\n}\n\n$candidate_length = Get-ArrLength $arr\n\nif ($candidate_length -gt $original_length) {\n    $arr[$arr.Count-1] = $arr[$arr.Count-1].SubString(0,$arr[$arr.Count-1].Length-($candidate_length-$original_length))\n} elseif ($candidate_length -lt $original_length) {\n    $arr[$arr.Count-1] = $arr[$arr.Count-1] + \"#\" * ($original_length-$candidate_length)\n}\n\n$contenttext = [string]::Join(\"`n\", $arr)\nsc grubenv ([byte[]][char[]] \"$contenttext\") -Encoding Byte\nRestart-Computer\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the assignment of $name with the name of your installation\nas it appears in GRUB.

I know that the kernel uses device drivers to interact with hardware. But laptops for example come with all kind of hardware configurations. Yet, after installing Linux, somehow the kernel manages to function properly. I have not installed any Device Driver myself, yet the OS has no trouble in interacting with the hardware on my computer. This suggests that the device drivers used are built-in the kernel.\nBut since computers come in all kinds of configurations, how does the kernel have the device drivers for all of them.\nSome are integrated and some have to be installed afterwards?\nSome Hardware work the EXACT same way regardless of build? [I assume all keyboards might all work the exact same way.]\nWhich ones are built-in and which are not?\nIf the kernel can work with my GPU without me installing any device driver, since I obviously see stuff on the display, then what is the nVidia driver for? Does it add anything?\n\nA: Most of hardware drivers are built into linux kernel. It is always better when they are. But in some cases you can or have to install them separately:\n1. Hardware vendor does not disclose protocol to interact with hardware and releases closed source proprietary drivers. In this case there is no way but to install them separately.\nBut frequently there are also alternative open source drivers that are created by reverse engineering. These drivers are integrated into the kernel but may perform not as good as proprietary.\nExample: AMD and Nvidia video drivers, Epson printer and scanner drivers, etc.\n2. Open source driver exists but is not integrated to mainline kernel yet. Or is integrated to unstable versions, or to unsupported by Ubuntu kernel versions.\nIn this case drivers can be obtained from PPAs or as source code from github or other places.\nExample: Focaltech touchpad driver, Realtek bluetooth driver, etc.\n3. Sometimes open source drivers in mainline kernel exist but do not perform as good as some alternative open source drivers developed by hardware vendor or community.\nIn this case it is an option to install alternative drivers.\nExample: Realtek wireless drivers.\n\nIf some of your hardware is not supported, it is always good to report it to launchpad. Someone will take care of it and add support to linux kernel. Also co-operation with testing is helpful.\n\nI would like to add an important note regarding installation of standalone drivers.\nIn most cases hardware drivers are built and installed as kernel modules.\nIf you build a kernel module from source, after kernel is upgraded the module will not work. It is built for a specific kernel version. You will have to re-install it after each kernel upgrade.\nThat is why it is always preferred to install drivers from PPAs with DKMS packages, or install them using DKMS manually.\nIn this case after each kernel upgrade the module will be automatically re-built and installed for a new kernel.\nBad example is installing Nvidia drivers from .run files downloaded from Nvidia site. In this case the driver is not registered correctly in DKMS and after first kernel upgrade you will have a black screen.\nBut you can always get all Nvidia drivers packed as DKMS from PPAs.\n", "Q: How can I route between different network using multiple ethernet card?

Awk prints the 5th collumn (since in awk by default columns are separated by spaces), which will be 795}. sub function merely replaces } with blank. The result is that you extract the number itself. \nNote: awk can do this all by itself without grep by using /SEARCHTERM/ form. Here's the code:\nawk  ' /OBJECT IDENTIFIER/ {sub(\"}\",\"\");print $5}' testfile1.txt\nNotice , that in both code versions, you're relying on finding the string and extracting whatever number is placed between the curly braces, so regardless  of what the number is, you still going to extract it as long as it is in there, next to the right string.\nVersion with grep and cut\nA bit more lengthy alternative to the first command is this:\ngrep \"OBJECT IDENTIFIER\" testfile1.txt | cut -d '{' -f2 | cut -d'}' -f1 | cut -d' ' -f2\ncut command does what it sounds like - cuts of things after specific delimiter. So here we find the necessary string (output there is OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { enterprises 795 } ), cut off whatever comes second after '{' (output is now enterprises 795 }), cut of whatever comes before '}' (now we have enterprises 795), and cut of second thing after ' ' (space) (now we get 795 or whatever number is there).\n", "Q: wicd-curses errors on fresh default 14.04 install I have a brand new fresh 14.04 ubuntu install but cannot get wicd-curses to run.

However, though another poster mentioned that you should always quote variables, this is incorrect. Often quoting a variable will help resolve a possible ambiguous variable name, it often causes other problems by interfering with other quoting. The correct way to specify the variable, in such cases, would be the use of curly brackets around the variable name, not quote around the whole variable. For instance, the original code could be rewritten as:  abc=\"1 hello world\"; L=$(echo ${abc}|awk '{print $1}'); echo ${L}\nOh, @heemayl, you forgot to quote the $1 in your example, which is just as well as putting a quote around that variable doesn't work.\n\nA: In your command ... $($abc|awk '{print $1}'); ..., the content of $abc is executed as command.

Convert one song (if you have time) using handbrake which can be downloaded from the ubuntu software center. If your computer has multiple sound cards try with each sound card. (Go to setting>>>sound). It could also be that the sound card is proprietary hardware which means you need to download the software to run the soundcard.   \n", "Q: How do I get pyspark on Ubuntu? I can get Spark on it through the Software Center, but how do I get pyspark?\n\nA: pyspark is available via pypi. \nSo all you need to install pyspark is pip and execute the following command.\npip install pyspark or sudo pip install pyspark\n\nA: pyspark is a python binding to the spark program written in Scala.\nAs long as you have Java 6+ and Python 2.6+ you can download pre-built binaries for spark from the download page. Make sure that the java and python programs are on your PATH or that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set. Follow these steps to get started;\n\n\n*\n\n*Unzip and move the unzipped directory to a working directory:\n\ntar -xzf spark-1.4.0-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz\nmv spark-1.4.0-bin-hadoop2.6 /srv/spark-1.4.8\n\n\n*Symlink the version of Spark to a spark directory:\n\nln -s /srv/spark-1.4.8 /srv/spark\n\n\n*Edit ~/.bash_profile using your favorite text editor and add Spark to your PATH and set the SPARK_HOME environment variable:\n\nexport SPARK_HOME=/srv/spark\nexport PATH=$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH\n\nNow you should be able to execute pyspark by running the command pyspark in the terminal.\nSome references:\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html\nhttps://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/getting-started-with-spark-in-python\n", "Q: Use of Yubikey Neo for login 2FA and lock screen I want to use my Yubikey Neo to login to Ubuntu 14.04. In addition, it would be convinient if the screen is locked automatically everytime I unplug the Yubikey.\n\nA: First, we need to configure the Yubikey for challenge response. A good manual for Linux is given by Yubico under\nhttps://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/Authentication_Using_Challenge-Response.html\nNow you should be able to use your yubikey for authentification at login. One convenient piece is missing: The automatic lock of the screen when die Yubikey is removed.\nI adapted slightly the HowTo from the Yubico forums (http://forum.yubico.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=1143) to match with LightDM in 14.04 and the Yubikey Neo.\nFirst of all, create a new file with the commands to lock the screen when the Yubikey is not present:\nsudo nano /usr/local/bin/yubikey\n\nWrite the following into the file:\n#!/bin/bash \n# Double checking if the Yubikey is actually removed, Challenge-Response won't trigger the screensaver this way.\n\nif [ -z \"$(lsusb | grep Yubico)\" ]; then\n        logger \"YubiKey Removed or Changed\"\n        # Running the LightDM lock command\n        export XDG_SEAT_PATH=\"/org/freedesktop/DisplayManager/Seat0\" \n        /usr/bin/dm-tool lock\nfi\n\nThe biggest differences to the original file is the use of the dm-tool (for locking the screen with lightdm) and the search term Yubico, since the Yubikey Neo is registered with „Yubico.com“ in lsusb.\nClose and save the file. In addition, we have to make the file executable:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yubikey\n\nNext, we have to find the properties of the Yubikey for a proper assignment.\nFor this the USB descriptor must be activated. Details can be found on the Yubico forum.\nIn a new terminal type in the command\nudevadm monitor --environment --udev\n\nNow you (un-)plug your yubikey and get a list of Ids. Looking for\nID_VENDOR_ID\nID_MODEL_ID\nID_SERIAL_SHORT\n\nThey will be used in the udev file for recognition of the Yubikey.\nHint: The vendor ID changes if you reconfigure the stick (e.g. with CCID)\nFurthermore, create a file with\nsudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/85-yubikey.rules\n\nand type the following\n# Yubikey Udev Rule: running a bash script in case your Yubikey is removed \nACTION==\"remove\", ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}==\"1050\", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}==\"0010\", ENV{ID_SERIAL_SHORT}==\"0001711399\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/yubikey\"\n\nChange the ID according to your key. Note: You can add more yubikey by simple copy paste the line with other Ids!\nClose and save the file. Finally, the udev service has to reload the rules:\nsudo udevadm control --reload-rules\nsudo service udev reload\n\n\nA: You can also add killing all TTY's using pkill -KILL -t:\nif [ -z \"$(lsusb | grep Yubico)\" ]; then\n    logger \"YubiKey Removed or Changed\"\n    # Running the LightDM lock command\n    export XDG_SEAT_PATH=\"/org/freedesktop/DisplayManager/Seat0\" \n    /usr/bin/dm-tool lock\n\n    ACTIVE_TTY=$(who | awk '{ print $2 }' | grep tty | uniq)\n    echo $ACTIVE_TTY | xargs -I {} pkill -KILL -t {}\nfi\n\nAlso there seems to be a problem with file permissions from lightdm, to solve it:\nsudo chown lightdm:root /etc/yubico/[user]-[number]\n\n", "Q: Asus R9 270 not working I just got a new graphics card and when I boot up it will only use the card to display the boot screen although once it boots it only uses the integrated graphics.\nThe open source driver works fine but the proprietary one (which I need for Steam) does not.\nHow can I get the driver working?\nUpdate:\nIt ended up being a problem with the BIOS.

For fans: I'm not asking which is better, only the differences.\n\nA: First off, the install will not install a regular app. What it installs is known as a web app.\nThis will cause it to still open up in your browser, but it will be able to do some 'smart' interactions with Ubuntu (like using Ubuntu's notification for notification, dash integration, volume panel integration etc.) and a shortcut will be added to the dash in most cases.\nSo the difference is just that the website/app is smart in being able to appear as a local app while still running in the browser.\n", "Q: I deactivated zeitgeist and need help reactivating it All I have been able to do is to activate it in the startup programs, but not in the privacy settings, it looks different now.\nI also run from a terminal:\nsudo chmod -x /usr/bin/zeitgeist-daemon\nsudo chmod -x /usr/bin/zeitgeist-datahub\nsudo chmod -x /usr/lib/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-ft  \n\nduring deactivation, how can undo this?\n\nA: You have removed the executable rights with -x.\nHere is your undo:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/bin/zeitgeist-daemon\nsudo chmod +x /usr/bin/zeitgeist-datahub\nsudo chmod +x /usr/lib/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-ft  \n\n\nThese are the settings in my system:\n% ls -la /usr/bin/zeitgeist-daemon\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 214216 Mär 10 17:00 /usr/bin/zeitgeist-daemon\n% ls -la /usr/bin/zeitgeist-datahub     \n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 131696 Mär 10 17:00 /usr/bin/zeitgeist-datahub\n\n\nOr reinstall the packages:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall zeitgeist-datahub\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall zeitgeist-core\n\nI can't find /usr/lib/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-ft for Ubuntu\n", "Q: Problem setting the resolution I have a 1360x768 tv that I am currently using for my display and whenever i set it too that resolution it is zoomed in and cuts off the sides.

When a server is spun up it will be initialized with chef, which will be used to install these dotfiles on the system. \nWhat's the best way to go about doing this? I see a few options, but they all have their downsides -\n\n\n*\n\n*Install them under /etc (e.g. /etc/profile).Pros: Every user will read from this system-wide location. Cons: It overwrites any existing version of those flies that come pre-installed. We could always copy those into ours to begin with, but then we have to update and maintain them. May not be a problem depending on how often versions of Ubuntu end up changing the default dotfiles\n\n*Install them under /etc, but with another names (e.g. /etc/bash_configs) and then append a line to the stock profile and bashrc files to source our new files. Pros: It will also work and our settings will be sources. Cons: Seems really hack, and relies on programmatically appending a line to the end of the stock files to source our additional custom files.\n\n*Install them under /etc/skel so that every time a new user is created, those templates will get copied to their home directory. Pros: Each user will get their copy of the files correctly. Cons: What if we update the files, will they get updated in each individual directory? I'm guessing now. It would be better if there a way to symlink the files so all users point to the same files.\nI might be over-complicating it, but it just feels like there has to be a cleaner way to do this that I'm missing. I'd be most interested in if there's a way to implement #3 with some sort of auto-update mechanism.\nThanks!\n\nA: I think I would go for a mixture of 2 and 3. Place your modified files in /etc/bash_config or wherever. Then, modify the defaults in /etc/skel and have them source the files in /etc/bash_config. \nThis has some of the advantages of both 2 and 3:\n\n\n*\n\n*New users will have the right files;\n\n*Any changes will immediately be propagated since the files are being sourced;\n\n*This allows users to still modify their own dotfiles as they please.\n\n*It does not involve editing the stock /etc/bash.bashrc or /etc/profile files. This means that upgrades won't break your system.\n\n\nNote that upgrades modifying the /etc/skel files could cause issues since that would mean your modifications were removed. That shouldn't be a big deal though. \nAs for its being hacky, well OK, it is. A little. Not too bad though, all you need is to run something like this once:\necho \". /path/to/my_bashrc/\" >> /etc/skel/.bashrc\necho \". /path/to/my_profile/\" >> /etc/skel/.bashrc\n\n\nA: Just place you modifications in /etc/profile.d/ with .sh extension (e.g. /etc/profile.d/MYCOMPANY.sh). They will be called by /etc/profile automatically.\nThis way you can always update and all users will get those updates.\n", "Q: In Ubuntu 15.04, boot-repair running forever, trying to fix the system after deleting all kernels I have deleted all my kernels.\nI am trying to fix the problem with boot-repair from live USB\nI have LVM enabled\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Once you are in live usb try the following comments\nsudo -i\napt-get update\napt-get install lvm2\n\n{IF FILE SYSTEM IS ENCRYPTED => DECRYPT}\n\nvgscan --mknodes                        *##not down the volume name##*\nmount /dev/<volume-name>/root /mnt      *## For me 'ubuntu-vg' ##*\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot               *## fdisk -l for right sd--##*\n\nmount --bind /dev /mnt/dev \nmount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\nmount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nmount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\ncp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf\nchroot /mnt\n\napt-get update    \nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\nupdate-grub \napt-get clean\numount /mnt\nreboot\n\n[DECRYPT] If the file system is encrypted then decrypt \napt-get install cryptsetup\nmodprobe dm-crypt\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 crypt1  *## fdisk -l to get right sd--##*\n*##Write the passphrase##*\n\nCredits goes to kyodake for his answer to How to reinstall kernels\n", "Q: Few questions about /root /home directories and installation location options So, I'd like to install Ubuntu 15.04 alongside Windows 8.1. I currently have a 120GB SSD and 2TB SSHD. I will be usng Ubuntu for programming, currently only plan on installing Eclipse and MDK3. Now I have 10GB of free space I created on my SSD and 50GB on my SSHD. What I would like to know is, do programs install to the /home directory? Should I give more space to my /home directory or /root directory? Is 6GB enough for my /root directory and 4GB for my /home directory or should I just install both on my SSHD? I plan on using the SSHD for swap-space anyway. Thanks (Ubuntu says 5GB is enough?)\n\nA: First, let me clear some things you seem to have misunderstood:\n\n\n*\n\n*/home is not your home directory. It contains the home directories of the users of the system.\n\n*/root is not the file system root, but the home directory of the system's root user. The file system root is /\n\n\ndo programs install to the /home directory?\n\nTL;DR: No.\nWhen installed by the package manager, thy go to various locations in /usr, e.g. executables go to /usr/bin, libraries to /usr/lib, and other stuff, such as resource files would go to /usr/share.\nWhen software isn't installed using the package manager, i.e. manually, it follows the same as above, but in /usr/local.\nProprietary software, which may not be directly installed from official repos often goes into /opt.\nNote that settings, cache files, etc. of these programs are stored in your  home directory. Also, not all software follows those standards.\n\n\nIs 6GB enough for my /root directory and 4GB for my /home directory?\n\nSee above: /root != /.\nAs you are planning on installing few software, 6GB seems enough for the root partition. I'd say you could even go with less. Much more so if you installed a more lightweight flavor like Lubuntu.\nDepending on how much code you are going to write and how much resources such as images etc. you need, I'd say 4GB could be somewhat scarce. Personally, I'd put /home on the SSHD and give it somewhat more space, but again, I don't know how you are going to use your system, so this is actually 99% opinion-based.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 doesn't shutdown properly on MacBook Pro 5,3 After about 2 weeks of trial and error trying to get this lovely OS working on my Mac, I still have a few issues:\nI can't figure out how to make f1-f12 work as standard function keys w/o holding fn.\nI have to boot in Legacy mode in ReFind with apci=off in GRUB.\nAnd most importantly, shutting down gets me as a black screen with the message \"[2501.546937] reboot: System halted,\" with the underscore blinking underneath, from which point I have to hold down the power button.

Since I mostly use my laptop as a desktop, I'm trying to set its CPU to its maximum frequency.\nThe CPU is an Intel Core i5-3337U (dual-core with Hyper-Threading), which caps at 2.5GHz (with 2 active cores) and at 2.70GHz (with 1 active core) using the Intel Turbo Boost Technology.\nBefore starting, I tested which frequency the CPU could reach under load using LINPACK, to see if despite any active power-saving feature it could have reached the nominal maximum value of 2.5GHz; it could (measured running watch -n 1 \"cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \\\"cpu MHz\\\"\").\nI chose to use the cpufreq-set approach: I've installed the cpufrequtils package and at first I tried to set the CPU governor to \"performance\" running cpufreq-set -g performance; I can't tell whether this impacted somehow the idle frequency's range, however the result was not satisfying: in this state the frequency of all the CPUs constantly dropped down and rose up in the 1.0GHZ-2.4GHZ range.\nSo I tried to set the CPU governor to \"userspace\", in order to eventually be able to set a fixed frequency; however the following error came up:\nError setting new values.

Note that the processor itself can backoff the CPU frequency under no or extremely light load conditions, regardless of what it is told to do via the frequency driver.

This is called your WINEPREFIX. Naturally (as with everything in linux) this location can be changed, but I'll assume that you left it at the default.\nSo you have your WINEPREFIX in the /home/<user>/.wine folder. If you look into it you will see a drive_c folder which is exactly that, your \"C:\". In that folder you will have an exact copy of a Windows filesystem.\nSo your file's paths will be something along the lines of /home/<user>/.wine/users/<user>/dowloads/.\n", "Q: Remote desktop access to Ubuntu 14.04 behind an uncontrolled router The problem is I want to use the remote desktop to access to an Ubuntu 14.04 (A) from another Ubuntu 14.04 (B).

I have installed Ubuntu with 3 partitions.But I can't create a new folder or can't allow to save any documents into the partitions. what might be the problem? Is there any settings for it or Is there any mistakes in my installation?\n\nA: Try changing to root using sudo su and then creating/modifying documents using administrative privileges using mkdir. \nNote: Using root account you might harm your filesystem. Be careful about that. \n\nA: You say you created three partitions, but you haven't specified why you've done this or how you've laid them out. Given that you're trying to create files on these partitions, I suspect you're applying DOS/Windows thinking to Linux partitions, and it's led you astray in a fundamental way, so let's deal with that issue first....\nLinux doesn't use drive letters. Instead, filesystem partitions are mounted at mount points (directories -- normally empty ones) in the unified filesystem, which begins at the root (/) directory. The presence of this directory implies a root (/) partition or filesystem, too. It can end here, with everything stored on one filesystem. When it doesn't, though, the convention is to create partitions that correspond to uses described by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). The FHS describes where different types of files go in a Linux system, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ -- As just noted, this is the base of the directory structure.\n\n*/usr -- Holds application programs, in specified subdirectories like /usr/lib (for libraries) and /usr/bin (for program files).\n\n*/etc -- Holds configuration files.\n\n*/home -- Holds user data; typically each user has one subdirectory, such as /home/sam for Sam and /home/jenny for Jenny.\n\n*/boot -- Holds the kernel and key boot loader files.\n\n\nThese are just a few examples; there are many more directories described in the FHS. Some of these directories may not be split off into separate partitions; for instance, /etc cannot be so split because it holds a key file (/etc/fstab) that describe where partitions should be mounted.\nNote that this is very different from Windows because the locations of certain types of files are set to specific directories. In Windows, you might install the Latest and Greatest App to an arbitrary partition, like C: or E:, but in Linux, your options are more limited. In Ubuntu, installing a new program via a Debian package file results in its files being written to whatever directories the package maintainer specified -- typically subdirectories of /usr, perhaps with a few configuration files in /etc.\nPartitions are created in Linux to help isolate different types of data according to the FHS standards. One common split is of /home, so as to simplify re-installations and backups. Some people split off /var, /tmp, /usr, /boot, or others, for various reasons. My first advice to users who want to partition is to keep it simple. Ubuntu uses root (/) alone (and a swap partition, which is another kettle of fish entirely), but I favor creating a /home partition, too, even for relative newbies. Make root (/) 10-30GiB, swap a little more than the size of your RAM, and give the rest to /home. If you're dual-booting with another OS, you may want a shared-data partition, too. When you learn more, you can create more partitions.\nComing back to the main point of this, I suspect you created three partitions because you're used to doing that sort of thing in Windows, where you might use them to isolate your user data from your program files. In Ubuntu, though, you'd want to assign them mount points during installation -- to mount your user-data partition to /home, for instance. In a dual-boot environment, you might also set aside a partition for sharing files with Windows (or OS X or whatever). The FHS doesn't clearly address such partitions, so there's less standardization on where to put them. Some people let Ubuntu's auto-mounter handle it, but others mount them somewhere convenient via /etc/fstab entries -- for instance, you might put a shared-data partition at /home/yourname/shared.\nThat said, the reason you can't access the partitions is because, if they use Linux filesystems, Linux's file-ownership characteristics apply to them. You can make them accessible by changing their ownership and/or file permissions. For instance, suppose a partition is mounted at /media/part. You could change permissions with chmod:\nsudo chmod 0777 /media/part\n\nThat sets very lax permissions that allow anybody to read or write to the partition. This affects only the root directory of the partition, though; if it's already got files and directories, you'll need to change their permissions, too.\nIt might be better to change ownership instead of permissions:\nsudo chown yourname: /media/part\n\nChange yourname to your username. As with chown, this affects only the root directory.\nFor more on this topic, do a web search on \"Linux ownership and permissions.\" There are tons of articles about it, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Learn Linux, 101: Manage file permissions and ownership\n\n*Understanding Linux File Permissions\n\n*Linux Users and Groups\nGoing back to my initial suspicion, though, if I'm right that you created three partitions because you applied Windows thinking to Linux, you should probably start over again from scratch. It will be difficult to make use of partitions sized in the way you probably did within Linux -- difficult enough that re-installing is almost certainly easier.\nIncidentally, I do NOT recommend using FAT or NTFS except as shared-data partitions in a dual-boot configuration. Linux file permissions exist to help keep you safe, and neither FAT nor NTFS supports this feature. It's much better to learn to use the tools you're given than to throw away the Linux tools in favor of a (figurative) rock you found on the ground. Furthermore, neither FAT nor NTFS performs as well as a Linux-native filesystem, so you'll be giving up performance as well as security. Of course, if you're dual-booting and are using a shared-data partition for files you must access in both OSes, that need takes priority.\n\nA: I suppose if you created the partitions with another installation before you installed Ubuntu, you might not have the correct administrative rights to use those partitions.  I suspect that's not the problem though.  I suggest you open gparted and reformat those partitions which should make you their owner.\n\nA: If single boot:-\nYou can store your data in /home directory also if you have Linux only file system. As Rod Smith tell, \n/home -- Holds user data; typically each user has one subdirectory, such as /home/sam for Sam and /home/jenny for Jenny.\nIf Linx+Linux (ex.Redhat6 + Ubuntu) dual boot system and try to access other drive inwhich other Linux OS is inltalled\nIn Linux operating System,\n1)Without super user privilege you can not access some files and not able to open other users data also. Its better for your and others privacy and security also.\nBut you want copy files in another drive (means a drive in which you install other Linux.) you must have super user privilege. But it harmful as Mayur already said in answer Note: Using root account you might harm your filesystem. Be careful about that.  for Linux+windows dual boot system  \n2)If you have some more space in your hard drive and you able create new partion without reinstallation OS I recomends create FAT filesystem type partion.\n3)Why EXT2/3/4 or NTFS not recommends Ans-->ext2/3/4 can not access through windows and NTFS not access through some linux ex. Redhat6. (Ubuntu can access NTFS), But FAT filesystem is universal filesystem and it very usefull for data transfer.\nfor creating FAT partition use Gpart or disks utility. \n", "Q: How can I make Skype chat UI dark?

It has always been the simplest way for me to stop my laptop from overheating and crashing... yes, ubuntu crashes due to overheating,...

Any answer concerning this question is greatly appreciated! Thank You all in advance! :)\n\nA: One of the best ways to do this is to install indicator-cpufreq if you wish to do the limit frequently [since this app starts on login]:\nsudo apt install indicator-cpufreq\n\nWhile if you do limits not so often, you can install cpufrequtils\nsudo apt install cpufrequtils\n\nThese are the safe ways too, in the sense that you do not have to do edits inside the system.\n\nA: You've not mentioned the CPU model, so we don't know if it supports scaling, but if it does, you could try using cpufrequtils from the repositories.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install: sudo apt-get install cpufrequtils\n\n*sudo cpufreq-set -g powersave - this will change the governot to convervative, and use the lowest frequency\n\n*sudo cpufreq-set -f <supported-frequency> - to change the frequency manually.\nFor more info look at cpufreq-info --help and cpufreq-set.\n\nA: With Ubuntu 22.04, I managed to easily change CPU frequency with cpupower-gui\nsudo apt install cpupower-gui\n\n\n\nA: I did this with setting up in /etc/sysfs.cfg \nIn my case I did fill in this file the following line for each cpu\ndevices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_max_freq = 2700000\ndevices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy1/scaling_max_freq = 2700000\n\nand it worked for me. To find out how the exact path is to your controls, you've only to search through /sys/ as the lines in the /etc/sysfs.ctl do exactly that, they set up the values in this place. I had 8 cpus so there are 8 lines beginning with policy0 and ending with polidy7.\nTo quick check how it works on your system I did use the inline function:\ncpufreq-info\n\nwith that function you may see how your system operates the cpu at the moment. So if it is setted up you may check if that worked or not.\nTo quick check how it workes you may do such kind of a command\nsudo /bin/sh -c \" echo 2700000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_max_freq \"\n\nif you only want to give a special programm rules you could use the tool cgroups. I think to drop down the speed is not allways better for the temperatur as if you get than because of this to much processes waiting, your cpus will run all the time on full speed and your system stays slow. But I did it because of the same reason. My cpu is now not more running with full speed 3100000 and uses a maximum value of 2700000 what is quick enough for me and doesn*t disturbs at all. I've never got the heat that quick up.\n", "Q: Same update keeps showing up everyday I keep getting update of numix-icons-theme package everyday, how to stop it? \nI've installed that update many times still it keeps showing up.\n\nA: First you should note this is dues to really another update every date as shown in their PPA.

I want to install Ubuntu and be some with it but I'm not sure how... Or if the thing even has enough space for it.\nI tried installing it, running it.. Nothing is working and I guess it's because it needs drivers but how do I know which ones I need? It seems like it should be so simple but every time I try something else I end up putting it back in the closet for another 3 months.

I will partition sda4 to make room for linux.\nMy questions are about sda5, 6 and 7\nWhat is the purpose of sda5? It is flagged \"diag\" but it is unlabelled. Do I need to keep it if I want to restore windows to the factory state at some point?\nsda6 (SAMSUNG_REC2) is the recovery partition created (I guess) by a samsung tool which I must have uninstalled as soon as I got the computer. My understanding is that the Windows RE tool (on sda1) will be able to restore Windows from this recovery partition, am I right?\nsda7 (SAMSUNG_REC) is a 1GB FAT32 partition. I don't know if it is important or not since I already have SAMSUNG_REC2... \nCan I safely delete sda5 and sda7? Am I right in keeping the 5 other ones?\n\nA: First, the \"diag flag\" is (sort of) explained in the parted documentation:\n‘DIAG’\n\n    (MS-DOS) - Enable this to indicate that a partition can be used as\n a diagnostics / recovery partition.\n\nI've not seen any evidence that this flag is actually used, but my knowledge of the Windows world is limited. Thus, I wouldn't mess with the flag itself. I also wouldn't use it as an indicator of whether a partition is necessary.\nSecond, /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda7 are both pretty small -- 471MB and 1074MB, respectively. Your disk is 1000GB, so they consume a total of 0.1545% of your disk's capacity. Given that GPT can take up to 128 partitions by default (and that value can be raised, if necessary), these partitions aren't using up enough space or partition slots to be a concern -- certainly not compared to the risks involved in deleting a partition whose purpose you don't fully understand.\nThird and OTOH, a lot of computers today ship with enormous amounts of bloatware, and there's been at least one recent pre-installed malware scare (Superfish). Windows 8 is also rather un-loved compared to its predecessor, Windows 7. Thus, many people prefer to wipe the pre-installed Windows and re-install using a Microsoft-provided image. This will result in a cleaner install, without any manufacturer-provided add-ons. A Web search will turn up plenty of sites describing how to get legal copies of Windows for installation; this is the first page to turn up in my search, but you can find others easily enough. Note that if you plan to install anything but the version that shipped with your computer, you may need to buy it, rather than rely on a free image from Microsoft. It's best to ask on a Windows forum if you need more help with this. The point of this paragraph, though, is that a re-install from a Microsoft image is likely to have a simpler partition layout than what you've got now, since some of those \"extra\" partitions probably exist to service the manufacturer-specific tools.\n\nA: If you look at it on Windows, in the Disk Management stuff accessible by right-clicking on 'This Computer', you will immediately find out that those partitions are used for recovery, at least according to Windows.\nPersonally I don't think doing so is a good idea. If you are really willing to try, mount and see what's in them first. Then you can consider deleting them, which almost certainly makes the recovery from Windows 8 EFI unavilable, or resizing them with gparted so you can gain a little more space.\n\nA: I do not think anything will happen to your Windows installation if you remove recovery partitions. But Samsung recovery tool will not work.\nsda7 is only 1 GB of size. Why don't you leave it as it is? It may be some UEFI recovery.\nGPT has no limit on number of partitions, so there is nothing to worry about.\n\nA: Diag partition is a important partition for windows recovery that was made after installation win11.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Popcorn Time TV Stick I purchased a \"PC on a Stick\" Intel Atom cpu, 2gb ram, 32gb storage.

You need to \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that output is unbuffered, that it is printed as soon as it's received. Pipes are buffered by default. \n\n*Parse the downloader's output so that only the percentages are printed;\n\n*Parse the output so that the file number is printed with a # at the beginning of the line. Zenity will automatically update the text of its dialog with lines starting with #. \n\n\nCombining the above, and implementing a little regex magic, we get:\n#!/bin/bash\nyoutube-dl --extract-audio --audio-quality 0 --newline --audio-format mp3 \\\n           https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1C815DB73EC2678E | \n grep --line-buffered -oP '^\\[download\\].*?\\K([0-9.]+\\%|#\\d+ of \\d)' |\n    zenity --progress \\\n  --title=\"Download\" \\\n  --text=\"Downloading...\" \\\n  --percentage=0 \n\nExplanation\nThe --line-buffered option makes grep print its output immediately, turning off the default buffering. The -o makes it print only the matched portion of the line and the -P turns on Perl Compatible Regular Expressions. \nThe regex is a little complex, so let's break it down:\n\n\n*\n\n*^\\[download\\] : matches lines that start with [download].\n\n*.*? : 0 or more characters, but the ? makes it stop at the shortest possible match. \n\n*\\K : this is basically a lookbehind, it means \"ignore anything matched so far\".\n\n*(...|...) : the | means OR. Therefore, (A|B) wil match either A or B. \n\n*[0-9.]+\\% : 1 or more numbers or . followed by a %. This prints the percentage. \n\n*#\\d+ of \\d : a # followed by one or more digits, of and then one or more digits again. This matches the \"Video X of Y\" line.\n\n\nTaken together, that grep command will print:\n#1 of 4\n0.1%\n0.3%\n0.8%\n1.7%\n3.4%\n7.0%\n14.0%\n28.2%\n56.5%\n99.5%\n100.0%\n100%\n#2 of 4\n0.1%\n0.3%\n0.8%\n1.6%\n3.4%\n6.9%\n13.9%\n27.8%\n55.8%\n[...]\n\netc, and that's precisely the output that zenity needs. Finally, you can make the whole thing more useful by implementing the ability to specify multiple URLs from the command line:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor url in \"$@\"\ndo\n  youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-quality 0 --newline --audio-format mp3 \\\n           https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1C815DB73EC2678E | \n   grep --line-buffered -oP '^\\[download\\].*?\\K([0-9.]+\\%|#\\d+ of \\d)' |\n    zenity --progress \\\n  --title=\"Download\" \\\n  --text=\"Downloading...\" \\\n  --percentage=0 \ndone\n\nThen, you can call your script like this:\nmyscript.sh \"http://url1.com\" \"http://url2.com\" \"http://urlN.com\n\n", "Q: permission problem while installing hadoop? after extracting hadoop I open my .bashrc file and edit this \nexport HADOOP_HOME=\"/media/hadoop/linux/soft/hadoop-1.2.1\"\nPATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin\nexport PATH\n\nthen save and open new terminal and type hadoop version but it say the permission problem of bash.\nbash: /media/hadoop/linux/soft/hadoop-1.2.1/bin/hadoop: Permission denied\n\nso what permission should I give??????\nthe command  ls -l /media/hadoop/linux/soft/hadoop-1.2.1/bin\nshows the result \ntotal 144\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop 15147 জুল    23  2013 hadoop\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  2643 জুল    23  2013 hadoop-config.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  5064 জুল    23  2013 hadoop-daemon.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1329 জুল    23  2013 hadoop-daemons.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  2810 জুল    23  2013 rcc\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  2050 জুল    23  2013 slaves.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1166 জুল    23  2013 start-all.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1065 জুল    23  2013 start-balancer.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1745 জুল    23  2013 start-dfs.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1145 জুল    23  2013 start-jobhistoryserver.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1259 জুল    23  2013 start-mapred.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1119 জুল    23  2013 stop-all.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1116 জুল    23  2013 stop-balancer.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1246 জুল    23  2013 stop-dfs.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1131 জুল    23  2013 stop-jobhistoryserver.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop  1168 জুল    23  2013 stop-mapred.sh\n-rw------- 1 hadoop hadoop 63598 জুল    23  2013 task-controller\n\nthe unique part is that I try to install from downloaded file and stuck with some bash permission problem.Although if I follow the whole process of it.\nI may install hadoop properly but I want to know what's wrong with my process also notice that I follow this video.thanks\n\nA: It seems like the hadoop user does not have the required permissions.\nTry:\nsudo chown -R hduser:hadoop /media/hadoop/linux/soft/hadoop-1.2.1\nThis command will make hduser (part of group hadoop) to be the owner of the directory /media/hadoop/linux/soft/hadoop-1.2.1.

I have a directory whose files have extension either .JPG or .NEF and I want to delete the files of the form X.NEF for which X.JPG does not exist in the directory. (X here can be any string.) I don't know how to do this other than by hand. \nA more general situation is when you want to find all the files in a directory A which exist in directory B as well. (The first problem can be turned into the second one using mmv.) \n\nA: You can use the shell's ${var%ext} parameter substitution features to remove the original extension on a per-file basis: to illustrate\ntouch file{1..6}.NEF file{1,2,4,6}.JPG\n\nThen\nfor nef in *.NEF; do [[ -f \"${nef%.NEF}.JPG\" ]] || echo rm -- \"$nef\"; done\n\nresults in\nrm -- file3.NEF\nrm -- file5.NEF\n\nExplanation:\nThe first command just creates 6 .NEF files numbered file1.NEF to file6.NEF and corresponding .JPG files for 3 of them i.e. just some empty files to test the second command on.\n", "Q: What is new on ubuntu 15.04?

This laptop does not have a physical NumLock key.\nMy Numpad works fine in Windows 8.1, the SSTYs, as well as lightdm (I can enter numbers via the numpad into the password input).\nAfter logging into Unity it only works for a short time. I succeeded once opening up a terminal and inputting a few numbers, before it got disabled. If I logout it no longer works in lightdm either.\nI can enable it using numlockx on.\nI already tried adding numlockx on to my autostart programs (which did not work) and also using dconf-editor to change org → gnome → settings-daemon → peripherals → keyboard according to a tutorial on German Ubuntuusers (which gets reset after reboot).\nThe accessibility feature to move the mouse via the numpad is not enabled.\nIt looks like something disables the numpad after logging into Unity. Any idea?\n\nA: Adding the command numlockx on to Startup Applications\nSome commands break if you add them to startup applications, because the command needs a fully loaded desktop to run successfully, and Startup Applications runs the commands too early.\nIf the command\nnumlockx on\n\nworks once you are logged in, I am pretty sure it is a matter of timing to make it work as a startup application. You can add a little break to make it work.\nSince Startup Applications creates a .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart to run the startup command, you need the \"regular\" syntax to add a complicated command (including the break) to be used in a .desktop file, which is in this case:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15&&numlockx on\"\n\nPossibly, you need to play a little with the sleep 15 to optimize.\nEdit\nAn alternative method to run the command at startup is mentioned here, but the result is the same.\nEDIT\nIf your startup procedure (-time) is unpredictable for some reason and/or the numpad is set to off repeatedly by some process during startup, you can make sure it works correctly by adding the script below to your Startup Applications\nIt keeps an eye on the Numpad, to be set on during the first minute after startup (log in):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nn=1\nwhile [ \"$n\" -ne 60 ]; do\nif [ \"$( numlockx status )\" != \"Numlock is on\" ]; then\n  numlockx on\nfi\nsleep 1\nn=$((n+1))\ndone\n\nAdd to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add, add the command:\n/bin/bash /path/to/script.sh\n\n\nA: I solved my issue by using gnome-tweak-tool to access the now unavailable keyboard settings of former Gnome / Ubuntu versions.\nAs I stated my in question my keyboard does not have a physical num lock key. The keys do not have any print for the other functions either:\n\nA thread in BackTrack Linux forum suggested to check “Numeric keypad keys work as with Mac”. Further searching revealed this screen shot from an older Gnome version:\n\nwhich can be found in this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/130213/27683.\nI “ignored” this answer, as the menu is gone in newer Ubuntu versions. Fortunatly I also wanted to disable Caps Lock. Searching revealed that one has to use gnome-tweak-tool to disable Caps Lock. gnome-tweak-tool basically brings back that old menu. Therefore I could also enable the setting to fix my num pad.\n\nAccording to launchpad bug tracker this is the recommended way to enable those additional settings: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-control-center/+bug/1245199/comments/6\n", "Q: skype wrapper on ubuntu 15.04x64 Trying to install skype wrapper on lastest ubuntu release.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:skype-wrapper/ppa\nThen:\nsudo apt-get update\nAnd I've have:\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/skype-wrapper/ppa/ubuntu/dists/vivid/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\n\nA: I've found sollution that helps me \ninstall sudo apt-get install sni-qt sni-qt:i386\nand just restart skype\n", "Q: 403 Forbidden Error LEMP I have a nginx server running with a wordpress and Ajenti setup working like a champ.

I'm looking for a simple legend that says 'this color means that' or 'comments are blue, functions are green', whatever. I'd think the need for this would be painfully obvious to all but I can't find it (the gedit help is useless). \nAlso, from looking around, it seems there is a way to set my own color scheme, but how would I know I got all the possible terms and forms colorized? Is there a list of those somewhere? \nFor example, I don't want to miss strings and functions and have them both end up black and thus I'm not getting the benefit of syntax highlighting - which I guess I'm not anyway since I don't know what all the colors I'm looking at now mean anyway.\nThanks. \nedit/update\n@ Maythux  Doesn't this apply only to gedit itself, and not Python?  I made a text file and saved it with a .py extension.   For example:   \nimport this:  | 'import' is purple  <br/>\nvar = some_variable  | both sides of the equation are black <br/>\n'This is a string'  | It is pink  <br/>\nfor is a special word, so is in  | 'for', 'is', 'is', and 'in' are all blood red  <br/>\n\"\"\"This is still a string\"\"\"   | Triple quotes are pink <br/>\n# This is a comment | but this string is dark blue  <br/>  \n\nWhere are these color rules coming from, and where is the legend that explains what color means what? ps - I hate markdown\n\nA: I realize I'm quite late to the party, but I had a similar issue and this thread was the first that popped up. So I thought I would add a thorough answer explaining what is going on.\nThe best documentation I found for how the highlighting works is the documentation for GTKSourceView (, which is what Gedit uses for highlighting):\nhttps://www.manpagez.com/html/gtksourceview/gtksourceview-3.12.2/ch02.php\nBut it doesn't answer OP's question directly.\nSo to answer OP's question more directly. I don't know of a simple list, but you can find the information you are looking for if you know a bit about how the highlighting works.\nThere are two important parts to how the highlighting works:\n\n*\n\n*The .lang file (there is one for each supported programming language), which defines how Gedit (or rather GTKSourceView) should understand the syntax of the programming language. i.e. in python.lang it is defined, that # marks a comment, \"for\", \"if\" and \"else\" are keywords, '...' is a string and so on.\n\n\n*The color scheme then tells Gedit how to color a generic comment, a generic keyword and so on, based on how comments, keywords, strings and so on are defined in the .lang file of the language you are currently using.\nWhat language you are using is specified in the bottom of Gedit: Language selection dialog currently python (2.x)\nWhat color scheme you are using is set under: menu -> preferences -> Font and Colors -> Color Scheme Color Scheme dialog\nThe .lang files are (probably) found in:\n/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/language-specs\n\nor\n/usr/share/gtksourceview-4/styles/language-specs\n\ndepending on your version of GTK.\nand the The color scheme/styles are in:\n/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/\n\nor\n/usr/share/gtksourceview-4/styles/\n\nagain depending on your version of GTK.\nSo to answer OP's question. You would go to the .lang file for the language you are interested in e.g. python.lang or python3.lang. There at the top you will find a list of styles looking like:\n    <style id=\"keyword\"           name=\"Keyword\"               map-to=\"def:keyword\"/>\n\nThis says, that the coloring style for python keywords (which are defined later in the python.lang file) should be colored in the same way as \"def:keyword\", which is the is the default for keywords in any supported language (\"def\" for default, def: refers to the default styles which are found in def.lang).\nThe definition of what a keyword in python is can then be found later if you search for 'style-ref=\"keyword\"' in a block like:\n<context id=\"keywords\" style-ref=\"keyword\">\n  <keyword>and</keyword>\n  <keyword>assert</keyword>\n  ...\n\nHere 'id=\"keywords\", means that the following entries are what we define as python keywords, 'style-ref=\"keyword\" means that the things listed bellow should be colored with the python keyword coloring style, and then it lists the keywords: \"and\", \"assert\", \"if\", \"for\" and so on.\nNow we know from the .lang files what the different styles are called and what is colored with which styles. Now we can specify in the color scheme which actual colors to use for all the abstract styles, that has been defined in the .lang files.\nIn the color theme files e.g. tango.xml you will find lines like:\n  <style name=\"def:keyword\"                 foreground=\"#0000ff\"/>\n\n\"def:keyword\" is the default keyword style which is used to color things according to the .lang files.\nand 'foreground=\"#0000ff\" means, that the text will be colored with the RGB hex value 00-00-ff - i.e. pure blue.\nThis will color the python keywords blue, since the keyword style defined in python.lang was mapped to def:keyword which we now declared should be blue.\nIt should also color keywords from all other languages blue (so long as they are also mapped to def:keyword in their .lang file).\nYou can also specify a color for the python keywords specifically, by writing:\n  <style name=\"python:keyword\"                 foreground=\"#00ff00\"/>\n\nwhere the part part before the colon is the id of the language (written at the top of the .lang file) and the part after the colon is the name of the style in that .lang file.\nThe styles which are not given a color, will be decided by your default color theme for Gnome/Ubuntu in a way, that I sadly do not understand ¯_(ツ)_/¯\n\nA: This is related to which color scheme you choose in Font & color prefrences of your gedit. For me I choose Classic\n\nNow to see how it highlights open the xml of the color scheme\ngedit /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/classic.xml \n\nHere is a sample of output:\n<!-- Bracket Matching -->\n  <style name=\"bracket-match\"               foreground=\"#white\" background=\"#grey\" bold=\"true\"/>\n  <style name=\"bracket-mismatch\"            foreground=\"#white\" background=\"#red\" bold=\"true\"/>\n\n  <!-- Search Matching -->\n  <style name=\"search-match\"                background=\"yellow\"/>  \n\n  <!-- Comments -->\n  <style name=\"def:comment\"                 foreground=\"blue\"/>\n  <style name=\"def:shebang\"                 foreground=\"blue\" bold=\"true\"/>\n  <style name=\"def:doc-comment-element\"     italic=\"true\"/>\n\nThen you can know that grey color is used for bracket matching and blue color for comments and yellow for search, etc...\nYou can check the other schemes from their xml files founded in the path:\n/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/\n\nAlso, as a hint you can use this xml to change the colors as you like so you can customize each scheme to your needs or likes\n", "Q: How do I prevent a folder inside of /tmp from being cleaned up? This question is about Ubuntu 14.10 on my developer laptop.\nI've got a folder in /tmp that is used by an application to put temporary stuff in there. This application usually makes a temporary folder in my homedir and deletes it afterwards. For some reason that doesn't work when the homedir is encrypted. So instead, I made a symlink to /tmp/foo inside my homedir. My application can write there and make it's temporary subfolder.\nNow /tmp/foo gets deleted every time I reboot my machine. Until now I've just recreated the folder manually after reboot. Now I learned in How is the /tmp directory cleaned up? that there is a job doing that.\nI've looked at /etc/init/mounted-tmp.conf but my bashfu and especially my findfu are not sufficient to do what I want. Here's an excerpt from that file:\n\n   EXCEPT='! -name .\n            ! ( -path ./lost+found -uid 0 )\n            ! ( -path ./quota.user -uid 0 )\n            ! ( -path ./aquota.user -uid 0 )\n            ! ( -path ./quota.group -uid 0 )\n            ! ( -path ./aquota.group -uid 0 )\n            ! ( -path ./.journal -uid 0 )\n            ! ( -path ./.clean -uid 0 )\n            ! ( -path \"./...security*\" -uid 0 )'\n\n   # Remove all old files, then all empty directories\n   find . -depth -xdev $TEXPR $EXCEPT ! -type d -delete\n   find . -depth -xdev $DEXPR $EXCEPT -type d -empty -delete\n\n\nWhat I want to do is add a condition that makes it delete everyting inside /tmp/foo, but not /tmp/foo itself. How do I do that?\n\nA: Not strictly an answer to your question, but you might find /var/tmp to be a more suitable location, as it doesn't get cleaned up over a reboot.  It's designed for temporary files that should not be automatically discarded after a short time.\nWhat I often do, however, is create myself a folder under /opt to store random things I don't want in home.  That's a suitable place to put things that are outside the main OS's control.\n\nA: Like so: \nEXCEPT='! -name .\n            ...\n            ! ( -path \"./foo\" )'\n\n   # Remove all old files, then all empty directories\n   ...\n   find /tmp/foo/* -depth -xdev $TEXPR -delete\n\nExample:\n$ cd /tmp/foo/\n$ mkdir 1 2 3\n$ touch 3 4 5\n$ find /tmp/foo/* -depth -xdev $TEXPR -delete\n$ ls /tmp/foo/\n$\n\nI do agree with user aap: You either should take care of this in the software used by re-creating the directory there if they are tmp files or use another directory if they are not tmp files that is not purged.\n\nA: /etc/init/mounted-tmp.conf is part of the mountall package, so any updates on that package and the suggested changes will be reverted.\n$ sudo dpkg -S /etc/init/mounted-tmp.conf \nmountall: /etc/init/mounted-tmp.conf\n\nInstead, according to the Filesystem Hierachy standard (FHS);\nRegarding /tmp:\n\nPrograms must not assume that any files or directories in /tmp are\n  preserved between invocations of the program.\n\nRegarding /var/tmp:\n\nThe /var/tmp directory is made available for programs that require  temporary files or directories that are preserved between system reboots. \n  Therefore, data stored in /var/tmp is more persistent than data in /tmp.\n\nSo you should change your symbolic link to use /var/tmp instead of /tmp.\n\nA: It is a bad idea to have files with future value, write to the /tmp directory (/var/tmp, as suggested by others, is a better place). That said, you might want to give a shot at chattr. This should be run after the application exits, but before a shutdown. Remember that this operation won't let anything write to that directory henceforth.\ntouch /tmp/foo/ddmmyy/.001_immute_me\nchattr +i /tmp/foo/ddmmyy/.001_immute_me\n\nA: Run this:\necho \"if [ ! -e /etc/foo/ ]; then mkdir /etc/foo/; fi; rm -rf /etc/foo/*\" > /bin/foodel; sudo chmod 755 /bin/foodel \n\nthen Add this to /etc/inittab see here: where is inittab file?:\nfoo:2345:boot:/bin/foodel\n\nThat will create /etc/foo on boot if it doesn't exist, and then empty it.\nThis will do the same on bash login:\necho \"/bin/foodel\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n", "Q: How to backup and reinsert .bashrc-like files with post-install script? I have my proudly written .bashrc and .bash-aliases files. Sometimes, I edit them. More often, I reinstall the whole system. \nWhat is the best and simplest way to preserve content of files (for example: syncing with Dropbox) and then implementing them in new and fresh Ubuntu? Off course, all of that in post-install script.\n\nA: Here's some of the suggestions I can give. Since .bashrc and .bash-aliases are just text files, you can use text storage websites, or just general cloud storage services, like dropbox. \nTL;DR IMHO, the best option is git ( 3rd entry in this post )\npastebin.com and paste.ubuntu.com\nThese websites' purpose is to allow pasting and sharing plain text or code, however you can use it as temporary storage. Typically they keep the entries for up to 2 years.\nKnowing a raw link to your paste, you can download that file with curl. Here's an example of me using curl to download paste of my .mkshrc file:\nserg @ ubuntu $ curl http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=8ETyB88j \nPATH=$(echo $PATH:$(find /home/xieerqi/bin -type d -printf \"%p:\")) \n\nPS1='serg @ ubuntu $ '\n\nalias ls='ls --color'\nalias addx='sudo chmod +x *'\n\nAs you can see I've downloaded that as plain text, the command also can be redirected to a file , for example curl http://url.com > filename\nhttp://textuploader.com/ also allows storing plain text but the maximum I saw is 1 year\ndropbox or other cloud storage\nThis is probably better option.

There is no other way to get all the features one would need on a given NGINX flavor.\n\nNGINX Naxsi is deprecated and unsupported.\nUnfortunately, the issue goes back to how SRUs are, and what Debian has done as of 14.04.  NAXSI is and always has been EXTREMELY hard to package, it is not a trivial modification.  Every single time they change a ruleset and such, everything else appears to break along with it, and the nature of SRUs and Debian updates preclude updating the module just to fix a small rules bug.\nSee this for details on the flavors.\nNote that NGINX Naxsi is no longer supported by me or Ubuntu anymore, since it's been dropped and has always been a headache to the NGINX packagers.\n", "Q: How do I remove comments of a file?

So I end up formatting again. God help me.\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ uname -r\n3.19.0-15-generic\nVersion 15.04\n\nA: After much frustration. I have written a guide on how I got my 970 drivers working below. The guide also covers how to fix any general NVIDIA driver if your OS is giving you a black screen of death on bootup, or installation. It is very detailed.\nHOW TO FIX THE BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH WITH UBUNTU.\nLet’s say you have a new hard drive and you are using a bootable USB with Ubuntu on it in order to install the OS. If you get to the installation page and say you click “Install Ubuntu”, then the screen goes black then it’s probably to do with your GPU. The problem is that modern kernels (the kernel is how software interfaces with hardware) have had the graphics mode settings put into them rather than left on the x driver (the X driver is used to allow an input device to interact with the display; so moving your mouse around your monitor display for example). By dumping the graphics settings into the kernel, it allows a nice looking splash screen to be displayed when your installing the OS and have nice sharp windows when installing the OS. However, if your graphics card settings don’t work with the kernel, then you can’t see the install screens. So you get a lovely black screen that displays no information what so ever. You now have to rely on the BIOS to interact with your GPU instead of the kernel so that you can have a GUI for your installation. To do this, when you boot from the USB, you have to wait for the installation screen and you need to press TAB when you’ve highlighted the “Install Ubuntu” option. When the page loads you will be able to see all the boot options, and you will have to use the arrow keys to navigate to a section that says something along the lines of:\nquiet splash $vt_handoff\n\nYou need to change it so that it says the line below, then press Enter to boot up using this setting.\nquiet splash nomodeset\n\nWhen your computer reboots, you will then be able to interact with the installation screens and complete the install.Once Ubuntu is installed, you will neep to click reboot as the final menu option, and when you reboot, you will need to remove your USB & break  the boot sequence again. But this time, you have to break the boot sequence by spamming the left shift key (you are trying to get into the GRUB that you just installed this time). The GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is just something that you can use to set boot options or boot into mutiple OS’s that might be installed on your hard drive. If you didn’t get into the GRUB then you have to spam the left shit key faster (some people say to hold shift, but that has never worked for me. If you spam the shit out of shift though, it always works eventually). When the GRUB loads, leave the default highlighted line selected (it will be the one that is the Ubuntu generic option and not the recovery mode) then press e. Within this menu, you will have to look through the boot options and find where it says the “quiet splash $vt_handoff” option again, and change it to say nomodeset (same as before/above).  You will then get your normal Ubuntu login screen, albeit with a terrible resolution, and be able to login. At this point it’s best to just do the following two commands to get your system up to date:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nYou are now ready to get your Nvidia drivers.  The actual syntax to do this is below (I will explain what the commands do, and how I arrived at these commands below).\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-[number_of_driver_version]\n! for me it was\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352\n\nThe xorg-edgers ppa command is used to install a repository of Nvidia drivers. Since your distribution of Ubuntu may not always include the necessary repository to install the latest driver (or your driver at all) for your graphics card, you sometimes have to get the repository manually by using the xorg-edgers ppa.. If you get a black screen on startup, then most likely your Linux distro didn’t have your graphics card driver, or repository for it. So you need to get this bunch of repository files which will later be referenced using the command underneath (to actually install the drivers). The last command is used to install the Nvidia driver, version 352 in my case. To find the version number you have to go to the Nvidia website and go to the download drivers section. You will get a bunch of drop down menus that you can use to identify your OS and your graphics card. Choose the correct items and click search. The website then finds the driver you need, and the key number you are looking for is at the top of the page where it says “version”. For me it said 352.21, meaning the major release is 352. So this is how I found what number to use in order to install the latest driver.\nAfter a reboot, this should be enough to get your Nvidia card working & make automatic updates work for new drivers they release (or any kernal upgrades you might install).\nYou then just run the command below to remove the ppa repository (since we already have the driver we want installed). The reason for deleting it is because it also has a bunch of other stuff within the repository that could be used for other programs when you update them. So it’s best to make sure you just remove it to reduce an unexpected install of software at a later date when you come to update/upgrade your distro.\nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\n", "Q: Unable to format a bootable USB stick I have a 8 GiB USB stick that I put Windows on some time ago.

I'm new to Ubuntu and Linux in general, and this probably seems like a stupid question, but just how do I actually boot up Ubuntu?

Tests on Ubuntu 16.4.\n", "Q: Life of background program If you start a background program in the terminal with the & option. Will it stop when you close the terminal?\n\nA: It stops when you hang up the terminal.  Terminals don't necessarily have the concept of being closed.\nWith a terminal emulator program, there isn't anything real being hung up, but closing the emulator program triggers an emulated terminal hangup.  (More strictly: closing the master side of the pseudo-terminal device qualifies as terminal hangup on the slave side.)  Not all emulator programs have the notion of being closed.  The one that is built into the operating system kernel, providing the kernel's virtual terminals, cannot be \"closed\", for example.\nWith a real terminal, there is a serial port with a carrier detect line, and a real modem hangup that can occur if the dial-in user on the remote terminal hangs up the telephone connection.\nThis all dates back to the days of timesharing systems with remote terminals where users were billed for use.  If one accidentally lost one's telephone connection, one most certainly didn't want to be billed for programs still running, potentially until the next system restart.  Conversely, system administrators and other users didn't want programs still running and attached to now notionally free terminals that might be then assigned to other dial-in users.\nA lot has changed since then.  BSD job control, for starters, inspired changes to the distribution of the hangup signal and the introduction of the notion of a session leader that is in charge of the jobs within a login session and whose death is considered to be a crushing blow to those jobs.  We've gained remote login over the Internet, and the idea of a GUI login session.  And terminal emulator programs have become so prevalent that people conflate them with the terminals that they are emulating.  \nBut the fundamental idea remains that user processes are in the normal case terminated — somehow, even if through the mediation of a session leader — when their terminal session ceases.\n\nA: Visit Running programs in the background from terminal or Most efficient way of launching and separating a program from the terminal?\n\nIf you start a background program in the terminal with the & option. Will it stop when you close the terminal?\n\nI find closing gnome-terminal by clicking on close button can cause stopping/killing of that program. But if you close terminal by exit command than program will not close/stop/kill.\n\nA: Yes, it will stop. To avoid the program being stopped, use nohup.\nFor instance, nohup firefox > /dev/null 2>&1 & , will both allow running firefox in background without closing and prevent error/output showing on console\n", "Q: getting rid of kubuntu while keeping ubuntu I have Ubuntu 15.04 and and I recently  put Kubuntu 14.04 on my computer alongside Ubuntu and this morning Kubuntu kept freezing at the login page.

Wife and I are both running 14.04 on our respective laptops with no problems.  We connect to the Home WiFi with no issues.  I purchased an HP-Envy 4500 All-in-one printer.  Works well with USB connection, no problems.  But when I attempt to set it up as a Wireless printer on our laptops it can not be found. \nThe 'Wireless Network Test Results' (created by the printer), shows a good connection, and passing traffic between the printer and the wireless router.\nWhen I go to system settings > Printers > Add Printer > Network Printer there is nothing listed.  If I click \"Find Network Printer\" no printers are found. \nIf I try to use HPLIP Device Manager with the USB cable connected, HPLIP will enter a crash-loop and not add the printer.\nWe would both like to have wireless printing capability but from other questions here, there seems to be some issues.  Before we moved, we had this functionality, but have had updates to Ubuntu, changed from DSL to Cable, and changed WiFi routers from Asus to Belkin.  Any ideas or suggestions?  \n\nA: I suggest that, rather than having the System Settings > Printers tool attempt to automatically find the wireless printer, you specify the Device URI. I have an HP printer and, although it attaches to my router with ethernet, I think the process is the same.\nI assume the 'Wireless Network Test Results' shows the printer's IP address. I suggest you use this to add a network printer:\nipp://<IP address>:631/lpr\n\nThen continue and let the system look for drivers, select HP and, I assume, since the printer worked by USB, the exact model is selectable. Test by printing a test page.\n\nA: Thank you for your proposed solution.  Your suggestion got me thinking and it turns out that the HP-Envy-4500 E All-in-one printer MUST be configured using a USB connection to the printer.  After connecting with the USB cable, using HPLIP I was able to enter the wireless printer setup utility.  Even though I had successfully connected to our home router, it was necessary to over write that information.  Once the connection was made according to the HPLIP configuration tool, all was good to go.  It is now working properly.  \nThank you for prompting my old gray cells. \n\nA: If the printer isn't found automatically you must manually enter the printer's IP. \nHere's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the printer to your existing WLAN access point\n\n\nYou'll need to use the printer's menu interface to connect to your wireless access point by following the prompts to enter your username and password.\nOnce your printer has connected to the WLAN, just to verify your computer can see the printer is on the network you can ping the printer using the following command:\n\nping 192.168.X.XXX\n\nWhereas 'X' will be substituted by the printer's IP address. You can find the printer's IP address by scrolling to the \"Wireless\" submenu and hitting enter. The IP address should be at the top of the screen.\nWhen you ping the printer you should see a reply, or else you know your machine can't view the printer on the WLAN. \nIn that case you should check your printer is connected, your firewall settings on your machine, and lastly the router's firewall settings if the problem persists.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your computer to the printer:\n\n\nUse the hp-setup GUI to scan for the device on the network.\n\nhp-setup\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select connection type \"Ethernet/Network/Wireless\"\n\n*Use the \"advanced\" option and enter the IP address of your printer under the \"manual\" section.

It stops when it reaches a directory that is its own parent, or cannot traverse to ...\nSo the reason that the root directory has (or as far as applications-mode programs are concerned at least appears to have as seen through the system API) a .. entry is that a lot of stuff is based upon the assumption that every directory has .., and that .. in the root being a loop can be used for detecting that one is at the root.\nPOSIX.1 does not in fact guarantee that the root directory has a .., merely specifying that programs have to account for the possibility of a loop if there is a .. in the root directory.  This is to permit non-UNIX systems to be POSIX-conformant too.  There are file systems where the absence of .. indicates that a directory is a root directory.  And there are, as Bach himself discusses, systems where there is a directory above the root, which POSIX.1 allows for in its discussion of absolute pathnames that begin with two slashes (similar to the Universal Naming Convention used in Microsoft local area network systems).\nLinux (and thus Ubuntu Linux), however, provides the stricter guarantees of the UNIX paradigm.\n\nA: Very simply:\nby means of file directory, ./ means this folder, while ../ means where the file is (e.g when I'm in the directory user/home/me/Desktop, then ../ will bring me to /user/home/me).\n", "Q: How to install Windows 8 next to Ubuntu? I've installed Ubuntu and now I want to install Windows 8. I've already done restoring of grub from the terminal, but now I dont know what to do. What should I do to install Windows? Please tell me all the steps. Thanks in advance. \n\nA: You shouldn’t have any issues, the issues occur when you have to dual boot an EXISTING Windows 8 OS and older Ubuntu versions. But if you are using 15.04 and you are installing Windows 8 after that there really should not be any issues or special procedures that you have to follow. You just may want to make a Ubuntu Livecd/flashdive and a boot repair cd/usb to have as a failsafe to fix any booting issues after installs.\n", "Q: Why do many software packages in Ubuntu have the letter 'g' appended?

Examples of this are such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*gedit\n\n*gparted\n\n*ganyremote\n\n*gvncviewer\n\n*gwhois\n\n\nMy first quick guess would be it's a shortname for \"gnome\" however I cannot find any particularly good information about it.\nThanks in advance.\nEDIT: Please excuse me but I'm extremly confused what tag(s) could fit this question; please update it if you have any recommendations.\n\nA: As it was very nicely pointed out to me, that these letters are in place to prevent the OSes from using the same names for different programs. Also to make it easier to see what OS the package belongs to.\nThe ones you listed are for the GNOME Desktop. They work in other environments, they were just developed in GNOME. If you type in man gedit it shows you the name, and this is what it shows. \ngedit - text editor for the GNOME Desktop \nThe same rule applies to apps like k3b a burning application for K Desktop Environment.  \nk3b - KDE CD burning program\nk3b can be installed into GNOME or other environments by typing in \nsudo apt-get install k3b\nWhen a application gets installed into another desktop environment, it grabs dependency files that work for the environment it was developed for.  It does not install the actual Desktop Environment though.\nNOTE: this is not always true.  I suggest when in doubt, check the man page or developers site as they should show you why it is named what it is.\n", "Q: E45 readonly option is set (add ! to override) I'm trying to configure the extension mcrypt in my Ubuntu Server VirtualBox for work in my phpMyAdmin page.\nI ran vi /etc/php5/mods-available/mcrypt.ini and then I changed extension=mcrypt.so to extension=/usr/lib/php5/20121212/mcrypt.­so and when I tried to save changes it said this:\nE45 readonly option is set (add ! to override)\n\nI think that maybe I made a mistake deleting something before extension=mcrypt.os and I don't know what to do.\n\nA: Try the below command\n:w !sudo tee %\n\nExplanation, What's happening?\n\n*\n\n*:w – write\n\n*!sudo – call shell sudo command\n\n*tee – the output of write (:w) command is redirected using tee\n\n*% – current file name\n\nSo, in next Press L to reload.\njust this!!!\n\nA: Probably the user you ran vi /etc/php5/mods-available/mcrypt.ini as did not have write access to the file. vi notices this on file open, and, when you try to save the file, gives you the E45error, and reminds you that you could attempt to override the read-onlyness of the file by appending '!' to the command.\nFor example, if you edited a file owned by your user, protected 444 (r--r--r--), you would get this message when you did the :wq, but could try to force the write with :wq!. In your case, I suggest doing ls -l /etc/php5/mods-available/mcrypt.ini. To actually edit the file, you could use sudo to temporarily use the power of root, and do sudo vi /etc/php5/mods-available/mcrypt.ini\n\nA: You can press Esc , and then U , and then type :q .\nYou can try opening the file with sudo privilege: sudo vi <file_name>\n\nA: First come out of the vim editor using: :qa!\nNext, use sudo vim filename and later: :wq\n\nA: This happens when the user is trying to write on a file without the right permissions.

When I start up my computer with the flash drive in which linux installed , it appears 4 options ( Linux, Linux recovery, window , windows recovery ).Linux used to work smoothly but something happened and I could not open linux again. Terminal screen appears but it says there is a problem with system file . But I still get 4 options in start-up and I can open windows 7 if I connect the flash drive.\nBut the problem is I cannot run Windows  without connecting the flash drive in which linux was installed.When I disconnect the flash drive and start up the computer in a usual way, windows logo never appears and black screen appears and it says like \" welcome to grub..there is no such a device..recovery mode..\" \nSo how can I run windows directly like in the past? I worry if I lose the flash drive I will not able to run windows either.\n\nA: To run Windows again, either grab your Windows Installation Disk, or make a Windows Recovery Disk. There are many tutorials on the subject, so I don't need to explain to you how. After you make your disk or find it, put it in your computer and access the BIOS by pressing a key during the boot-up process (usually F2, F10) and boot from your CD/USB. Once the installation menu or recovery menu pops up, open the command prompt and type this: BootRec.exe /fixmbr. This will allow you to boot back into Windows and make it the default loader when switching between operating systems. You'll be good to go.\n", "Q: Ubuntu desktop issues/overall systematic issues I have installed skype on my Ubuntu 14.04.2 version and after I restarted the computer the normal Login window popped up.

After downloading it, I'm stumped as to how write and compile a simple \"Hello world\" application.\nNote: I am very new to Linux! The file system looks rather odd to me after 20 years of living in Windows-world, so any help you can offer or a simple step-by-step guide would be much appreciated!\nThanks.\n\nA: AlainD,\nGeany actually has the options that you're looking for built in.\nAt the top of the screen towards the middle there is a button that looks like a little gear, as well as a button that looks like a brick wall. These are your options for compile and run. Once you've written your code to your satisfaction, you simply click the compile button, and at the bottom of your screen you'll see the output, and if there are any compile time errors. Once complete (assuming no errors) clicking run will cause Geany to open your system's default terminal and execute the program. The terminal will show exit status code when complete and will remain open until you close it.\nAs for compilers, most major distributions of linux have a pre-packaged collection of compilers and linkers. For ubuntu I believe you would go to the terminal and type the following:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nThese two commands will update the list of packages on your system, and then install the essential libraries, headers, and compilers needed for C, C++, and other common programming languages.\nBest of luck in your endeavors.\n\nA: To make sure the plugins are installed:\nsudo apt-get install geany-plugins\n\nAnd to run it with root acess (won't work properly without it):\nsudo geany\n\nThen punch in your password.

I can play with windows but for some reason I can't get windows installed on my laptop ( \\system32\\hal.dll issue).\nHow can I play the game from the drive, from a download, I don't care. I just want to play my one video game, gta san andreas. I played it on my desktop with Windows XP but the hard drive crapped out. Now I have a compaq pressario laptop and I just want to play the game again. I really DON'T like windows. I'd prefer Ubuntu over Windows, but I just can't seem to do all of the same things in Ubuntu that I could in Windows.\n\nA: Actually, it's entirely possible to play Windows games on Linux, as long as the game is supported by Wine and your hardware doesn't meltdown loading it. There are two ways to go about installing.\nI would recommend installing WINE and PlayOnLinux to make installing GTA:SA easier.(NOTE: Even with it being 'easier', you may have to work at it to get things running. Be persistent, and don't be afraid to ask questions and search with your preferred search engine.)\nInstalling Wine is pretty straightforward, since it's already in the repositories. Just open up the terminal and type sudo apt-get install wine. Once Wine is installed, it's a simple matter of installing PlayOnLinux using sudo apt-get install playonlinux. If you're uncomfortable with the terminal, you can always look it up in the software center.\nOnce you've installed both Wine and POL, we have to either pop in the disc or get the installer. When installing a game, PlayOnLinux should ask what you want you want to do. It's a pretty straight forward process, similar to Windows 'wizards' that we're all used to from the days before we found Linux.\nThe alternative way is to install Wine (just like before), install Steam.exe (which can be downloaded from here), and install GTA:SA through Steam.\nBy the way, here's a link to Wine HQ showing a positive user experience for GTA:SA. And here's the link to the PlayOnLinux website, which would have more in depth answers for anything related to POL, and includes a compatibility list of all games supported.\n\nA: Ubuntu does NOT have the same video rendering libraries as Windows (DirectX, OpenGL, Direct3D). Therefore, the developers of a hypothetical game have to redesign their game for the other platform. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was never meant to be designed for Linux (because in 2000, Linux was really for developers and not for casual use), so you won't be able to play that. Games made by Valve (Half-Life, Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike), for example, have been reworked to work on Linux, so you can play those types of games on Linux. Honestly, it really is out of your control on which games you can play on Linux. Sorry, but if you play lots of games on your PC, I'd suggest Windows due to its near-monopoly in PC games.\n", "Q: Linux Headers and Updates If I create a symbolic link from linux-headers in /usr/src and then an update comes along where my uname -r output changes, does that symbolic link get updated as well?  Or do I have to switch the symlink to the new uname -r output?\n\nA: A symbolic link is static to a location. This means that if you make a symbolic link for linux-headers-3.13.0-46 for example, that is the location it will link to, no matter what. That being the case, you would have to switch or recreate the symbolic link each time you update.\n", "Q: How do I name a repository I installed most software from the terminal. I saw that with some programs people give commands like this for example:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:jfi/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install psensor\n\nBut some just give commands like this: \nsudo apt-get install psensor\n\nIf that is the case, and I want to add repository (so that program receives updates more quickly, if I understood it right), how do I know what comes after ppa:? How can I find that out? \n\nA: From Launchpad:\n\nPersonal Package Archives (PPA) allow users to upload Ubuntu source\n  packages to be built and published as an apt repository by Launchpad\n\nLaunchpad is a website developed and maintained by creators of Ubuntu that allows users to develop and maintain open-source software.\nIf you have found a nice PPA and you want to add it to your repository, this is the general format:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name\n\nEvery PPA has its own page in Lanuchpad website. For example, the one mentioned in your post has its page here: https://launchpad.net/~jfi/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nIf you look at the PPA's overview page, under the heading Adding this PPA to your system, you can see the location of PPA. See the below image:\n\nYou can use the location to replace ppa:user/ppa-name in the above command. So, in your case it is:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jfi/ppa\n\n\nA: To know more about PPA's you can read them in What are PPAs and how do I use them?\nIf you want to find out the PPA of a repository, you can find them in launchpad\n", "Q: Raid 6 mdadm creation error I am trying to create a 4 drive raid 6 with mdadm in Ubuntu.

There is no problem logging in after a reboot. But I can no longer make software updates if they require root privilege; when trying to authenticate with my user password the dialog window \"shakes its head\" and the request is denied. So I have to cancel software updates. \nHere is what I've tried so far: \nSince I obviously can't use sudo for anything I booted the system up in recovery mode and used the <drop to root shell> menu item. Then I get a prompt \nroot>\n\nI then mount the / partition using \nmount -o rw,remount /\n\nAnd then tried first (let's just say my login is wuzzle)\nusermod -a -G sudo wuzzle\n\nThen rebooted, logged on and find that I still couldn't use sudo\nNext I tried, after the same procedure as above,\nadduser wuzzle sudo\n\nThis command, as the previous one, was accepted without response.\nYet, after reboot and login I still can't sudo. For example:\nls -l  /etc/sudoers\n\nshows it has this ownership\n-r--r------1 root root\n\nFurther, trying\ncd /etc/; more sudoers\n\ngives\nsudoers permission denied\n\nand\n$ sudo more sudoers\n[sudo]password for wuzzle: (password entered)\nSorry, try again. \n\nAlso, the date of the file /etc/sudoers indicates that it was unchanged even though I used before commands (as root) that I had expected should change the file.  \nNow I'm out of ideas. I tried to find a solution by searching and browsing around but it appears that everything written about similar problems always gives advice using commands that require sudo. So it's all catch 22. \nLater added:\nI also tried to use the same commands again (from the root shell in recovery mode): \n> adduser wuzzle sudo\nThe user wuzzle is already a member of `sudo`.\n\nBut that's not true. \n\nA: From your description, the account password itself isn't correct (the dialog window \"shakes its head\"). If this is the case, resetting your password with the rescue prompt should fix it.\n\nA: As per your comment, the reason for this was that your system was set to a different keyboard layout to the one you expected. I've run into that problem too. The keyboard shortcut to switch layout should work fine at the lock screen.\nI'm mainly writing this answer to correct a few misconceptions in your question.\nMax Lemieux's answer points out that the problem here was that you were typing the wrong password (not because you were making a mistake of course, but because you were typing on the wrong layout and had no way of knowing that because nothing shows up when the password is typed) and that is clear from the error you show:\n$ sudo more sudoers\n[sudo]password for wuzzle: (password entered)\nSorry, try again.\n\nThis error just means the wrong password was entered.\nYou showed in your question your repeated efforts to fix this by adding yourself to the sudo group. You even accused Bash of lying to you when it said you were already in the sudo group(!) The commands you used to add yourself to the sudo group were correct, and you noticed that they returned no errors. If you had not been in the sudo group, this is what would have happened when you tried to use sudo:\n$ sudo uname -r\n[sudo] password for unicorn: \nunicorn is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\n\nYou could have checked what groups you were in on the command line without needing sudo, using, for example, these commands:\n$ groups\nzanna adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare\n$ id\nuid=1000(zanna) gid=1000(zanna) groups=1000(zanna),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),120(lpadmin),130(sambashare)\n\nYou also said this\n\nYet, after reboot and login I still can't sudo. For example:\nls -l  /etc/sudoers\n\nshows it has this ownership\n-r--r------1 root root\n\n\nThat's exactly what it should be, and if those ownerships and those permissions are changed, sudo will refuse to work very stubbornly until they have been fixed (of course you will need to somehow get a root shell to fix it because you won't be able to use sudo). You should never change the permissions of the sudoers file.\n\nAlso, the date of the file /etc/sudoers indicates that it was unchanged even though I used before commands (as root) that I had expected should change the file.\n\nAdding a user to the sudo group does not change the sudoers file. If you examine the file, you will see how it is that adding a user to the sudo group gives them access to sudo:\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nSo, no need for a line about each user - this one line plus group membership gives you all the privileges you'll need. As far as I know, the sudoers file is never edited automatically.\nIf you ever do need to edit /etc/sudoers, be sure to use sudo visudo which won't let you save the file if you've introduced syntax errors.\n", "Q: Deleted Partition, Broke Grub I had Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my system, fresh install from a live USB. I was messing around with partitioning, trying to set up room for windows. Ended up deleting my ubuntu partition and rebooted. Now all boots fail.\nWhen booting to hard disk, it gives me grub rescue. When booting from live CD, it does the same thing. When booting from live USB, it gets to loading operating system and sits there for 30mins before I give up.\nls command returns:\n(hd0) (hd1) (hd1,msdos1)\n\nTried a few other commands, no luck. I have no data in there that I'm worried about, would like to start fresh now that I know a bit more about what I'm doing. Booting from Live USB/CD is not an option for me. Also tried Grub repair disk. I've been using Unetbootin to create disks and USBs.\nAny other way to fix grub?\n\nA: To help you (and perhaps others) avoid the problem in the future, you should first understand what happened. With that information in hand, you can recover your system and remove Ubuntu properly in the future (should the need arise again)....\nWhat Happened?\nMost Ubuntu installations, on both BIOS-based and EFI-based systems, split GRUB across two or more locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*The main GRUB binary -- This code is run by the firmware. Importantly, it does not reside in the Ubuntu root (/) or /boot partition. On BIOS-based computers, it resides in the first few sectors of the hard disk (or if the disk uses GPT, in the first sector of the disk and in the BIOS Boot Partition). On EFI-based computers, it resides in the EFI System Partition (ESP). This means that the main GRUB binary will not be erased when you delete an Ubuntu partition, and the firmware will continue to boot it; however....\n\n*GRUB support files -- In most cases, GRUB loads its configuration file and other support files from the Ubuntu /boot/grub directory. This directory is deleted when you delete an Ubuntu installation.\n\n\nThe result is that when you delete an Ubuntu partition, GRUB can launch, but it can't do anything, because it's been figuratively lobotomized.\nThat said, one thing about your story is puzzling: You say that you're no longer able to boot from a USB drive. An Ubuntu installer image is designed to be self-contained; it does not rely on the contents of your hard disk, and should not be affected by the state of GRUB (or anything else) on that disk. You must be running into some unrelated problem -- maybe some RAM has gone bad since you did your initial installation; or you're trying to boot a different version of Ubuntu that doesn't like your video card; or you prepared the USB drive incorrectly. These are just wild guesses, though; there are about a million possible reasons why a boot from a USB drive might fail. In any event, I recommend you try other Linux distributions or prepare your medium using another program to work around this problem. If necessary, post a new question with more details about that aspect of the problem if you can't get it to work.\nHow to Recover\nRecovering your system involves installing a working boot loader on your computer. It sounds like yours is BIOS-based, so this means modifying the MBR. If you want to make your Windows bootable again, the best approach is probably to use a Windows recovery tool. There are Windows procedures for restoring an MBR, but I don't recall the details. A Google search turned up this tutorial, but there are 658,000 others in my search, so try your own search if that procedure doesn't work for you.\nAnother option is to re-install Ubuntu (or any other OS, really). As part of the OS installation process, a new boot loader will be installed. If you re-install Ubuntu, that boot loader will be GRUB, and the installer should detect Windows and make it an option in the GRUB menu.\nOne caveat is to watch your boot mode (BIOS vs. EFI); you don't want to mix them. It sounds like you've got a BIOS-mode Windows installation, so you do not want to install Ubuntu in EFI mode. If your computer is from before 2011, chances are this won't happen, since EFIs started to become common only in mid-to-late 2011. If you've got a more recent computer, though, you may need to be careful. After booting your installation medium but before installing, drop to a shell and look for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS mode. If you've booted in the wrong mode, try again, but pay attention to boot menu options. Typically, external media have two options, one with the string \"UEFI\" and one without it. The one with the \"UEFI\" identifier boots in EFI mode and the one without boots in BIOS mode.\nHow to Not Do This Again\nIf you need to remove Ubuntu again on a BIOS-based computer, it's best to restore a non-Ubuntu boot loader to the MBR before you delete the Ubuntu partition(s). You can use a Windows recovery disc to do this, or there are ways to do this from Ubuntu, as described here (among other places).\nOn an EFI-based computer, you can use efibootmgr to change the boot order before you delete the Ubuntu partition(s). Type sudo efibootmgr alone to see the options, then identify the Windows (or other OS's) boot entry number from the list, and use the -o option to set it first in the list, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 2,7 to boot Boot0002 first and to boot Boot0007 as a fallback. Another option is to delete the /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu directory from Ubuntu immediately before you wipe out the Ubuntu partition(s).\nOn either type of computer, another option is to set your boot loader up in a way that can survive the removal of Ubuntu. One way to do this is to use a separate Ubuntu /boot partition, but to not delete it along with the main Ubuntu partition. Then GRUB will continue to operate, although it will present non-functional Ubuntu options and, in the absence of a Linux installation, it will be difficult to change its boot options. There are ways to set GRUB up on a FAT partition in an OS-independent way. The GRUB4DOS boot loader can be used on a BIOS-based computer, for instance. On an EFI-based system, alternatives like gummiboot or my own rEFInd don't rely on Ubuntu partitions, and can be used instead of or in addition to GRUB.\n\nA: I believe you can use unetbootin to create a bootable usb thumbdrive from a bootable cdrom image. I have done this.\nIf you go to this page and download the iso image for a bootable cdrom of the boot repair utility and make that boot repair thumbdrive, you can painlessly restore grub to your hard drive.\nYou may be interested to know that I have such a boot repair thumbdrive in my emergency repair kit.

I'm able to connect to vpn but I don't know what to put into Remote Desktop Connection.\n\nA: I am not sure I really understood your question but normally, you should only need to enter the hostname or IP address of the Computer you want to connect to in the Computer or Computer Name box and then click connect.

I have three local drives, C, D and E in my Windows 8.1 installation. C drive is where Windows is installed. I've my E drive emptied. I have downloaded the Ubuntu 14.04 ISO image and created a bootable disk, and I want to install it now, without losing the Windows installation.\nThe last time I did this, I was unable to boot backup to Windows again - I fixed it using Boot Repair. So what's the correct way to install Ubuntu after Windows?\n\nA: You need to create four partitions:\nN) fs, size, mountpoint\n\n1) ext2, 512 MB, /boot\n\n2) ext4, at least 10 GB, /\n\n3) ext4, at least 5 GB, /home\n\n4) swap, 2x available RAM, none\n\nThen when installing from disk, it will ask you to erase windows or install alongside. Make sure you choose \"Something Else\". \nThen, make the partitions as described above. Remember to select the ext2 partition for bootloader installation. \nAfter installing, use a program (in windows) such as EasyBCD and create an entry in the windows bootloader to point to the ext2 partition which, if you followed my instructions correctly, should be where GRUB is installed. \nNext time you boot, you should be able to select which OS you want to boot into. I am using this setup and dual booting windows 8.1 and xubuntu 15.04 on my laptop. \nHope this helps!!!\n", "Q: Why ntpd needs an open port? On my Ubuntu system I have activated the 'Time Synchronization via Internet'. Because of that the ntp daemon gets started.\nWhat I don't understand: Why needs ntpd an open UDP port 123? Actually, I don't want to have a ntp server running on my machine - my intention was only to synchronize my time with ntp servers on the internet. \nSo, my question are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is there an open port by default if I only want to synchronize with other ntp servers?\n\n*Isn't that a unnecessary security risk?\n\n*Has somebody a good solution for my 'problem'?\nThank you very much for your help in advance. I searched the internet already but I couldn't find sastisfactory answers.\n\nA: Quoted from this perfect answer\nISC ntpd (the ntp package) will open UDP 123 on all your interfaces \nregardless of what you do with it. It will work anyway even if you block this\n port in iptables, assuming that you're allowing responses to established traffic \nas usual - your outbound mobilization requests to your chosen servers will be\n enough to allow the responses, and the same with further traffic sent for \nthe lifetime of ntpd. Using iptables like this is probably the easiest way to \nsecure ntpd. There's also some defense in depth you can do:\n- run ntpd as non-root\n- run it chrooted to some safe directory (really only makes sense when doing \nnon-root as well, since root can break out of a chroot)\n- apply ntpd's built-in access controls (see examples in ntpd.conf, and full\n docs in ntp_acc(5))\n\nFor more information please read the full answer in the link above, In addition take a look to this answer in SU\n", "Q: Chromium: Bad HTML5/Flash Video Performance Ok, so here I have 2 issues:\n1 - Apparent vertical sync problem\nHere's a screenshot of the problem\n\nSee that line? it looks like the next frame of the video, as if it's out of sync.

I put it on Github if you're interested:\nhttps://github.com/Bartwillemsen/virtual-devbox\nBasically what you need to do on your Ubuntu guest settings is create a second Network adapter and make it \"host-only\".\n\nThen, on the first adapter (which is NAT by default, you can set some port redirections.

But, if the cron is added to the crontab of root, you don't have to use \"sudo\". I would suggest you to switch to root ( su - root  ) and then add the cron entry to root's crontab so that you don't have to worry about the permission. If the copying does not require root permission, you can do this directly in the user's crontab without sudo\n", "Q: Remote desktop session is not working I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

After that mate desktop session by xrdp is working only at first time. While I am trying to re-connect remote desktop session, it is not working again. How can I make remote desktop session persistent in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?\n\nA: To have persistent connection (we assume that you want to reconnect to existing session),  you have two options \nupgrade your Ubuntu 14.04 to a higher version. \nThe upgrade will allow you to use the new xrdp package (version 0.6-1.x) which allows you to reconnect to existing sessions (out of the box - no tweak necessary).

But I am trying to create a binary directory that can be moved anywhere on one's file system and still work. \nBut I would also like to be told how to install Octave (in a way that isn't moveable like a binary package) on my system. If it is the way I suggested, i.e., moving the contents of /opt/octave/build to / please tell me how to from the command line, please. \n\nA: The short answer is that you should build Octave with --prefix=DIR rather than specifying DESTDIR=DIR on the make install command, as was already indicated in the comments.\nYour more fundamental question is how to create a binary installation of Octave that can be moved anywhere on the filesystem and still be fully functional. And the answer is that it is currently not possible to do that. When Octave is compiled, several paths to its own libraries and scripts are compiled into the executable so it can find its own runtime. Some of those may be able to be overridden (see for example octave --help for some options to override default paths), but some current cannot, such as the path to mkoctfile or octave-gui. The locations of these helper programs depend completely on the value given to --prefix when Octave is built.\n", "Q: Several unmet dependencies I have recently tried downloading steam from the Ubuntu Software Centre but when I try to launch the program I got the bellow error message.

How to determine whether a given package is shipped by default in Ubuntu installation or it's installed later by the user?!\nThe answer in this U&L says:\n\nTo figure out if a package (Tor here) is installed by user, run this\n  in terminal:\napt-cache show tor | grep Priority\n\nif the priority was optional‍‍‍‍‍,\n  The package was installed by user, If was standard (important on\n  Debian ) it's a default installed package.\n\nWhile a simple test for example ubuntu-desktop\n$ apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop | grep Priority\n\ngives:\nPriority: optional\n\nThen I could say this is not a proper way.\nSo how to determine whether the package is shipped by default or not?\n\nA: To determine whether a package is included by default in a given Ubuntu installation, search for the package name in the manifest file of that Ubuntu release.\nExamples\n\n*\n\n*Searching for the ubuntu-desktop package in Ubuntu 14.04.2 64-bit manifest shows that ubuntu-desktop is included by default in the Ubuntu 14.04.2 64-bit ISO file.\n\n\n*Searching for the sysinfo package in the Ubuntu 14.04.2 64-bit manifest shows that sysinfo is not included by default in the Ubuntu 14.04.2 64-bit ISO file.\nThere is a link to the manifest file for Ubuntu 14.04.2 at the Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (Trusty Tahr) - Ubuntu Releases webpage.\nOffline method\nIt is also possible to find whether a package is included by default in a given Ubuntu installation offline without an internet connection, if you have already downloaded the ISO file for that Ubuntu installation.\n\n*\n\n*Browse to the ISO file for Ubuntu 14.04 if you have downloaded it, and open it with Archive Manager.\n\n\n*Extract the filesystem.manifest file which is located in the /casper directory.\n\n\n*Open the filesystem.manifest file in a text editor, like Gedit for example.\n\n\n*Search in the filesystem.manifest file for ubuntu-desktop, etc. the same way as in the previous examples.\n\n\n*Make a default.txt file containing a list of the package names of all the default packages with each package name on a separate line for easy searching from the terminal:\n cat filesystem.manifest | awk '{print $1}' | sort > default.txt\n\n", "Q: Environment Variable seems to be set yet not working I use Ubuntu 14.10 with bash shell.\nI downloaded a gradle distribution and moved it to a new directory.\nI want to permanently set a environment variable to point to the bin sub-directory of the gradle folder.\nI have edited ~/.bashrc and ~./profile according to recommendations to include the path to the gradle's running script.

That simply creates a variable called gradle and is irrelevant (unless that variable is somehow used by gradle but you haven't said so). What you want to do is add the directory containing the gradle executable to the list of directories your system searches through when trying to find programs to run. This is what the PATH variable does. \nIt is also important not to overwrite the existing contents of PATH. So, to add foo to the PATH, you do:\nPATH:\"$PATH\":foo\n\nAnd not \nPATH=\"foo\"\n\nThe latter will remove everything from PATH and replace it with foo alone. \nSo, combining all this, you want to add the following lines to your ~/.profile (or ~/.bash_profile if that exists, but not to your ~/.bashrc):\nPATH:\"$PATH:$HOME/sanctus/Documents/Development/gradle-2.2/bin\"\n\n\nWhy ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile and not ~/.bashrc? First of all, because that's what profile is for. More importantly, ~/.bashrc is read each time you start a new shell. So, for example, each time you open a new terminal. Setting environmental variables that only need to be set once in that file, makes them be reset each time you open a terminal and that's just needless overhead.\nAdditionally, settings in ~/.bashrc only affect programs launched from the commandline. If you launch something using the GUI ( a menu entry or a .desktop file, for example) those variables will not be available there. \nIn many systems, including Ubuntu, ~/.profile is read when you log in graphically. Variables set in that file will therefore be available to GUI programs as well. Also, setting these variables in ~/.profile is preferred since that file is only read once: at login. \nAdditionally, this will work even if you change your shell to something other than bash, since ~/.profile is read by many of the most popular shells. \nImportant : If a ~/.bash_profile exists, that will be read instead of ~/.profile. So, if you do have such a file, use that one instead. My recommendation is, if you have a ~/.bash_profile, to simply delete it and add anything that was there to your standard ~/.profile. \n\nA: First you should ensure that your script has execute permissions:\nchmod +x $HOME/sanctus/Documents/Development/gradle-2.2/bin/gradle\n\nYou may need to use sudo to do the chmod above..\nNow what you miss, when you call gradle you are using the environment variable PATH.\n\nPATH is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like\n  operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search for\n  executable files\n\nEven though you add the path to $PATH you did it in the .profile while you have to do it in the .bashrc.\nSo why .bashrc and not .profile?\nplease take a look for my answer https://askubuntu.com/a/633820/150504\nNow back to solution:\ngedit .bashrc\n\nAdd the line:\n export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$HOME/sanctus/Documents/Development/gradle-2.2/bin\n\nNow save and exit then source it\nsource .bashrc\n\nNow test it.\n\nUrgent Update:\n\nPATH=\"$HOME/bin:$HOME/sanctus/Documents/Development/gradle-2.2/bin\"\n\nThis would distort your PATH, and you can't use any command in /bin,/usr/bin,... since like that you just override your PATH and set it only to two dirs $HOME/bin and $HOME/sanctus/Documents/Development/gradle-2.2/bin.\nRemove this line from your .profile.\ntest if it affects your syste,\necho $PATH \n\nresult should be(maybe slightly differs):\n/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nIf it's not you should resolve the problem.

There is no option to run it with java.\n\nA: Running jars in linux is easy. Just open a terminal and type java -jar <path to jarfile> then hit enter and voilà it works.\n\nA: I don't know why you tried to click on it, the location of the .jar file should be in the $PATH of minecraft. I don't have any experience mindcrafting, I have alot of experience programming in Java and administering Java dependant applications on Ubuntu; I also set my brother up with Gary's mod on Ubuntu 12.04. \nSo basically here's the diagnostic flowchart you want to follow when you are foo-bar:\n1) Do you have a java virtual machine (JVM) installed (I used Oracle jdk7u26 I believe on that mod)? You can check by running the following command from command line:\n:~$ java -version\n\n2) Is the $PATH to the jre set ($JRE_HOME), either in your local startup script, the global startup script /etc/profile, or did your update the alternatives to give a symlink to /usr/bin/java, /usr/bin/jar? \nYou can check by running the following commands:\n:~$ echo $JRE_HOME\n\n:~$ echo $JAVA_HOME\n\n3) Is the location of the .jar in the $PATH of the mincraft executable? \nIn the possibility your using a mod.\n4) Whats the permissions of the .jar file you want to run?\n:~$ stat thisminecraft.jar \n\nAlso you have symlink for the jar and for java cause you updated /etc/alternatives, you can create a bash script, and add the script to a docking application like cairo-dock:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nRNJAR=\"java -jar /home/youruser/MyBin/theminecraft.jar\"\n\n$RNJAR\n\nexit\n\nSo create a directory like:\n:~$ mkdir -p -m0755 $HOME/MyBin\n\nThen copy the script above into gedit and save as \n/home/youruser/MyBin/minecraft.sh\n\nChange the mode of access to executable\n:~$ chmod +x $HOME/MyBin/minecraft.sh\n\nAnd you can create a custom launcher on cairo-dock or even put the script in the $HOME/Desktop (<- I never do this) folder as opposed to $HOME/MyBin.\nGood Luck, and may the minecrafting be prosperous.\n\nA: Java applications can have their own desktop or launcher icon to start like any other application.\nTo get there we just need to create a minecraft.desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications/ with the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nValue=1.0\nType=Application\nName=MineCraft\nGenericName=Minecraft\nComment=Start Minecraft\nIcon=/home/<user>/.icons/minecraft.png ## choose any Icon you like\nExec=java -jar /full/path/to/minecraft.jar\nCategories=Games\nPath=/home/<user>/.minecraft/\n\nCreate or download any icon you like it to display and store it in ~/.icons. The desktop file needs to have executable permission (right click Properties, Permissions, tick Allow executing file as program).\n", "Q: How do I deploy a point release such as 14.04.2 from MAAS?

The point release 14.04.2 works.\nHow do I deploy a point release for supported hardware directly from MAAS, rather than deploying the 14.04.0 release and then upgrading, as this will not work with the NIC being used. \n\nA: You edit a node and select the architecture to be \n\n\n*\n\n*amd64/hwe-u for utopic and \n\n*amd-64/hwe-v for vivid kernels.\n\n\nTo get all kernel releases including development ones update the boot images sync url, in the settings page to be:\nhttp://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/daily/\nand then re-import the boot images.\n", "Q: about setting up juju environment We are trying to setup openstack on a virtual environment-KVM(on a virtual machine where resources provided very well 12 gb ram, 500 gb hardisk, 6 processors). we were able to setup maas environment with 10 nodes. We want to progress to next step and setup juju for putting components of openstack which are horizon,neutron, nova, keystone, cellometer, cinder etc.(rest of all modules) \nMy question do we need to setup juju just onto \"maas controller\" or do we need to setup juju for each node? I didn't understand this point very well...\nCan you give me a clear explanation about this topic?\nthanks in advance...\n\nA: You install juju on the machine where you expect to drive the deployments from. It can even be more than one machine, and then you would share the environment file with other people.\nIt's kind of like installing openssh-client on the machines where you want to administer your network from. It's where you run ssh from. Same with juju. You will run the juju commands from some machine. It can be anywhere, as long as it can reach out to the nodes.\n\nA: Ok, I tried to establish \"juju environments\" to the node where I have install maas controller node. Then when you try to power juju bootstrap, it randomly chooses one of the node where it gets ssh from maas envrionment that you have already provided. So bootstrap of juju is going to be absolutely another node after you run\njuju bootstrap\n\nthen you can add machines to juju if you have in your maas environment and can \ndeploy any service that you want which is the magic of juju. \n", "Q: Unknown Partition Table Error on Boot Randomly after Reboot: Conflicting Device Mode I get an error on the boot that I took a screen shot below. Also the output of the fdisk -l command is shown. sda: unkwown partition table is the error. And then conflicting device mode.\nI am running Ubuntu 15.04 on an Asus UX301 dual boot with windows 8. The internal drive is ran as a raidx0 with two 256GB drives. I can boot into windows fine only Ubuntu seems to be the problem.\n\n\n\nA: Your problem is basically that you're using motherboard-based software RAID (aka \"fake RAID\"). For whatever reason, your installation isn't recognizing that software RAID format, which is causing your problems.\nI don't have a step-by-step solution to your problem (I avoid this type of RAID like the plague), but I recommend you start by reading the Ubuntu Fake RAID HOWTO. If that doesn't help, then perhaps somebody with more experience with this type of RAID will be able to comment.\nOne more point, though: Your RAID uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which means that fdisk is useless on that disk; you must use either GPT fdisk (gdisk) or something based on libparted (parted or GParted, for instance). The kernel's unknown partition table message is a manifestation of lack of support for your RAID configuration, but fdisk's failure to display partitions is a manifestation of its lack of GPT support; you've got two different causes that happen to show similar symptoms. Furthermore, use of GPT means that Windows must be booting in EFI/UEFI mode. I don't know how you booted your computer, but you must be sure to install Ubuntu in EFI/UEFI mode; booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode will create new problems for yourself. The Ubuntu Community wiki on UEFI installations, although somewhat disorganized, does a tolerable job with this subject; and my own Linux on UEFI page covers the pitfalls and procedures, too. Neither of these pages covers RAID explicitly, but if the RAID tools are set up properly, the RAID should be pretty transparent to the installation and boot mode.\n", "Q: How do I set up an encrypted SSH tunnel for VNC? Here's whats happening:\nThe TightVNC client on my Windows client does not interact with my Vino VNC server, because of some encryption stuff, as shown here: Gnome 3.10 sharing desktop --- how to configure the security type for VNC? . Therefore, I wanted to create an SSH tunnel. But I have no idea how to do it. Could you guide me?\nHere's how I wanted it to be set up:\nMy desktop, running Ubuntu GNOME, with the default Vino VNC server, can be accessed remotely through VNC, but with the (enabled by default) encryption turned OFF. However, on my Windows laptop, I want to be able to access the VNC Server using the VNC client TightVNC, with all the connections happening between them going through an encrypted SSH Tunnel.\n\nA: If the IP address of your VNC server is 1.2.3.4 (and running on the standard port), you might execute:\nssh -L 5959:127.0.0.1:5900 user@1.2.3.4\n\nThis sets up an encrypted tunnel from your local machine's port 5959 that magically comes out on port 5900 at 1.2.3.4\nThen you can VNC to localhost::5959\nThe above assumes that you're also running VNC on your local machine, so port 5900 is taken; 5959 is just another port.   If port 5900 is free, you can change the 5959 in the ssh line to 5900 and just connect VNC to localhost (127.0.0.1) without specifying a port.\nNote that your VNC server must be configured to accept loopback connections; some reject them by default to keep someone from VNCing to themselves and starting an infinite stream of cascading windows.\n\nA: Before connecting with VNC, I use a Putty client (https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to create an SSH connection from my Windows laptop to the remote linux server, and set up the tunnel using this. \nI leave this ssh session running while VNC is running so that the tunnel stays up. \nBefore the Putty connection is opened, while you are configuring it, you will find a menu item under the Category list on the left hand side of the Putty client configuration options called \"Connection\" with a sub-menu item called \"ssh\" and under this, a further sub-menu item called \"Tunnels\". \nOn this options page, configure the local (source) port as 127.0.0.1:5021 and the remote port as the hostname or IP address of your server, and the remote port that your vncserver on the linux host is listening on. Save the Putty session using a handy nickname. Open the session and log in on your linux server. This creates the tunnel. \nNow open your VNC Windows application and ask it to connect to 127.0.0.1:5021 - and it will use the tunnel that you've set up. Note that you're connecting to a VNC port on your local machine, which appears to be on your remote machine, and note also that on the remote machine, your firewall rules may need amending to allow local traffic on the port advertised by the VNC server,  but there is no need to ensure that your network card interface allows traffic on that port, because it is being tunneled over port 22 (your ssh connection).

So, I made this animation in a program, however, it doesn't seem to support exporting as a PNG sequence so I could convert it to a GIF. The animation is over 100 frames so saving each image one-by-one will take ages. However, it supports exporting as a \"strip\", which is like a movie film. Each picture in the animation has the same dimensions. Here's how the program's \"strip\" feature works.\nThe images in the animation are stacked horizontally, the first frame being the far left while the last frame being the far right. There are no gaps between frames, and the file name usually is \"name_stripX.png\" if the animation has X frames. If each frame was 32 by 32 and the animation had 8 frames, this file would have a width of 256 and a height of 32.\nHere is some example output, each color fills in one frame:\n\nAlso, just to clear things up a little bit more, the program is called \"Game Maker 8.0.\"\n\nA: You can use ImageMagick to convert images in varying ways, and it should be able to this quite easily. First you can split up into to parts (original.png being the source image, and in this case 32x32pixels in size):\nconvert original.png -crop 32x32 parts-%02d.png\n\nYou can then convert it into a animation (use -loop 1 if you don't want it to loop):\nconvert -loop 0 -page +0+0 ./parts*.png output.gif\n\nResulting in:\n\n\n\nThe output PNGs of the first command have a offset included in them, so without the -page +0+0 option the animation ends up like:\n\n\n\nThere are varying other options you can include (mainly in the second command), such as -delay etc - you can also optimize the animation so it is smaller (and faster to load/render) - e.g. borrowed from here:\nconvert output.gif -fuzz 10% -layers Optimize optimised.gif\n\nor using gifsicle\ngifsicle -O output.gif -o optimised.gif\n\nEDIT: If the frames are transparent, you can set the frames to replace by adding the  -dispose Background option, so when a frame is disposed of when the next one is loaded:\n\n\nExample above done without the page option so it shows clearly\n\nThe problem with this is you probably can't optimize the resulting image much then - so another way may be to make the frames opaque so the next frame covers the previous.\n", "Q: recovering lost 15.04 GUI After the latest system update, I lost my GUI. how does one repair Ubuntu desktop/ Unity?\n\nA: Try this:\nSwitch on your computer.\nPress and hold the Shift key, which will bring up the Grub menu.\nSelect the line which starts with Advanced options.\nSelect the line ending with recovery mode\nYour PC should display a menu with a number of options.\nSelect:\nThe option File system check \nand\nThe option Drop to root shell prompt with networking\nIn the terminal run:\nmount -o remount,rw /\nmount --all\ndpkg --configure -a\napt-get -f install\napt-get -m install\napt-get update\napt-get dist-upgrade\napt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop unity\napt-get autoremove\napt-get clean\nreboot\n\n", "Q: Installing utorrent on ubuntu 12.04 I've followed all instructions outlined in this link:\naskubuntu.com/questions/530955/how-to-install-utorrent-v3-3-on-14-04cd Downloads\nbut come upon an error like this:\nuser@host:~/Downloads$ sudo ln -s /opt/utorrent-server-alpha-v3_3/utserver /usr/bin/utserver\nln: failed to create symbolic link ‘/usr/bin/utserver’: File exists\nuser@host:~/Downloads$ utserver -settingspath /opt/utorrent-server-alpha-v3_3/\nNo command 'utserver' found, did you mean:\n Command 'ttserver' from package 'tokyotyrant' (universe)\n Command 'ktserver' from package 'kyototycoon' (universe)\nutserver: command not found\n\nWhat's going on, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: As Zviad suggested, DON'T USE UTORRENT! \nNot only is uTorrent is in tight association with MPAA, it's full of ads, it's a botnet that records your IP and whatever you download. \nuse:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deluge\n\n*qBittorrent\nI'm not saying your problem is not fixable, but it's not worth it...\n", "Q: Stuck on splash screen, does not progress to login manager My login manager stopped loading, for no apparent reason, instead tty7 was a black screen I could type into but with no effect.

I think it has something to do with ASUS. I am using ASUS TaiChi 21.\nAlso running systemctl enable for several login managers wasn't too much of a problem as it just creates symbolic links in /etc/systemd/system\nI fixed the splash screen not progressing to the login manager by changing the login manager to sddm, it was set to xdm. I did this by using a \"Try ubuntu live\" usb stick and modifying the file /etc/X11/default-display-manager from /usr/bin/xdm to /usr/bin/sddm. \nIn the process I learnt a little about how X11 and display managers work:\n\n\n*\n\n*X11 is a network protocol. It encodes things such as graphic primitives, images, pointer motion, and key presses.\n\n*Xorg is an X server. It implements X11 and provides an interface to keyboards, mice, and video cards.\n\n*gdm, xdm, kdm sddm are all login managers (synonym display managers) They are the first X program run by the system.\n\n*When the computer boots, the shell scripts in /etc/rc2.d are run. There is a script for each login manager such as S03lightdm. This login manager script reads from /etc/X11/default-display-manager and decides whether to init the display manager based on this value.\n\n*Upon authentication the login manager calls /etc/Xsession which calls the scripts in /etc/Xsession.d/ and ~/xinitrc which then sets up your desktop environment and window manager.\n\n\nSo presumably there was something wrong with either the installation/config/compatibility of xdm on my computer.\nFollowing this change I was able to see the login manager screen and was able to login but upon login it redirected me back to the login screen. This occurred due to running sudo startx which created the file ~/.Xauthority but owned by root. I finally fixed this by deleting .Xauthority and everything is back to normal!\n", "Q: How to Enable password after lock/Suspend I tried searching for an answer.

Maybe not having a timeout set will help your system just boot right up.  Then if you need to get into the recovery mode later on, you hold down the left Shift key during the boot process to bring the menu up.\nIf you copy and paste the following to a terminal window, it should update the GRUB_TIMEOUT to 0 for you:\n\nto=`grep GRUB_TIMEOUT /etc/default/grub | awk -F= '{print $2}'`; sudo perl -pi -e \"s/GRUB_TIMEOUT=${to}/GRUB_TIMEOUT=0/\" /etc/default/grub; sudo update-grub\n\nTo add the timeout back, copy the following to a terminal window:\n\nto=`grep GRUB_TIMEOUT /etc/default/grub | awk -F= '{print $2}'`; sudo perl -pi -e \"s/GRUB_TIMEOUT=${to}/GRUB_TIMEOUT=10/\" /etc/default/grub; sudo update-grub\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Upgrading from Ubuntu 13.10 to 15.04 I have dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.10.

It blocks the middle of the screen, it's not just like ubuntu's notify-osd which appears on top right corner.Please help, can I somehow remove it??\n\n\nA: EDIT: As of the new Cinnamon version 2.6 (currently in RC phase with Linux Mint 17.2), it is now possible to completely disable the media key OSD:\nSystem Settings → Preferences → Notifications → Media keys OSD size: Disabled\nI assume this requires the Cinnamon version of the control center. \n\nThis doesn't come from Cinnamon specifically, but from GNOME 3, from which Cinnamon was forked. Unlike  most other notifications or popups, these are shown directly by the desktop and not managed by some notification library like libnotify. They are hardcoded to show up when the volume or brightness is changed using the default key triggers.\nTo fix it, use your own hotkeys for XF86AudioRaiseVolume, XF86AudioLowerVolume, XF86MonBrightnessUp and XF86MonBrightnessDown, using commands not bound to the desktop.\nAs an example, you can use the following commands, but you have to install the package xbacklight before.\npactl set-sink-volume 0 +5% #increase sound volume\npactl set-sink-volume 0 -- -5% #decrease sound volume\nxbacklight -inc 20 # increase screen brightness\nxbacklight -dec 20 # decrease screen brightness\n\n\nNormally, meaning using Cinnamon's default theme or the Mint-X theme, this thing looks much nicer and is transparent. Then I like it. But the way it looks in your screenshot, it really is annoying. You may want to consider installing the Linux Mint default themes. You can get them by installing the mint-themes package and its dependencies. They are, however, only included in the Mint repos, so it might be easiest to get and install the debian package archives from a rebecca/main mirror, like from here.

Another point that may help is that I've recently reinstalled 14.04, and before I did so, the only way I could get Ubuntu to notice the second screen was by opening system settings. Immediately upon doing so (not even selecting the display tab, mind you), the second display sprang into action.\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: I just passed trough the same problem today (Lenovo Thinkpad T430) after a system upgrade. I could see that selecting a lower resolution for the external monitor works for showing the extended desktop, but looked ugly, so I kept the default highest resolution on both laptop's screen and external monitor, then, I discovered that disconnecting  all cables from the external monitor (power cable included) waiting ten seconds and reconnecting again worked just fine and I have my two displays working as usual in extended desktop mode.\n", "Q: How to Enable Lock on Suspend in Xubuntu I'm using xubuntu and I cannot enable the screenlock when suspending the machine.  \nHow do I enable the lock on suspend?\n\nA: Xubuntu uses gnome-screensaver. First, you must replace gnome-screensaver with xscreensaver. The tool that locks the screen on suspend uses xscreensaver. On top of that, if you use an external monitor with gnome-screensaver on a laptop, and lock the screen, it will be delayed in switching to the external monitor's resolution, or not do it all, unlike xscreensaver (in my personal experience). \nTo remove gnome-screensaver run:\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver\n\nThen, install xscreensaver:\nsudo apt-get install xscreensaver\n\nXscreensaver will be automatically added to your list of startup programs as the default screensaver program once gnome-screensaver is removed and it's installed in its place. If it's not, add the command xscreensaver -nosplash to your to your list of applications to be ran upon login. You can change xscreensaver's setting in the XFCE settings manager. To have all extra available screensavers for xscreensaver, run sudo apt-get install unicode-screensaver xscreensaver-gl-extra rss-glx xscreensaver-data-extra.\nNext, you need to install xss-lock. This program will invoke the xscreensaver lock screen upon system suspend. \nTo do this, run:\nsudo apt-get install xss-lock\n\nNext, you need to run xss-lock on start and tell it to suspend the lid when closed. This part is weird, but follow me. I don't know exactly WHY you have to do this, but it won't work otherwise. You need to create an executable with the command to do this instead of just have it run that command on login. To do this, I created a file simply called suspendwhenlidclosed, and pasted the command in there. \nThat command is:\nxss-lock -- xscreensaver-command -lock &\n\nNext, give it permission to run as a program, in this example, the file suspendwhenlidclosed is in the home directory.\nsudo chmod +x ~/suspendwhenlidclosed\n\nNext, copy the file to /usr/bin so that it can be ran from the command line, for conveniences sake. \nsudo mv ~/suspendwhenlidclosed /usr/bin\n\nNow, add the command to list of commands to be ran upon login, you can do this from the XFCE settings manager. Open the program named Settings Manager in Settings category in the Whisker Menu, or the Application Menu if you use that, and from within the Settings Manager, open Session and Startup, and go to the tab Application Autostart. There is also a shortcut to Session and Startup in the Settings category. Click the add button and add suspendwhenlidclosed to the list like in the screenshot below.  \n\nLastly, if you log in and out, another instance of xss-lock will be created for each time you do that, and each extra instance will have high CPU usage. To prevent this, you must run the command killall xss-lock during logout. To achieve this, create another file, in this example I call it killxsslock and it is also placed in my home directory. \nCreate the file killxsslock, copy this command into it, and save it. \nkillall xss-lock\n\nNext, give it permission to run as a program:\nsudo chmod +x ~/killxsslock\n\nMove it to /usr/bin so it can be ran as a command:\nsudo mv ~/killxsslock /usr/bin\n\nTo have killxsslock ran on logout so extra instances of xss-lock aren't created when logging in and out, you need to add two lines to your lightdm config file. \nOpen the file with:\nsudo mousepad /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf \n\nNext, add these lines:\n[SeatDefaults] \nsession-cleanup-script=/usr/bin/killxsslock\n\nAnd save. Then log in and out. Xscreensaver will now be your default screensaver and your laptop will automatically run the lock screen upon suspend. I hope this helps someone! :D\nOP had added this to their question - moved the content here as CW\n\nA: Go to Session and startup > Advance and mark the Lock screen before sleep option\n\nDon't worry.I am sure that it will work in Xubutnu as mint is made from it.\n", "Q: What is this strange shell?

They are all similar - older PCs with 1.5gb memory outfitted with 32-bit Ubuntu with Nvidia GeForce 6200 cards to help with performance (basic browsing) and have been working fine until the roll-out of 14.04.02.  When upgraded to .02, all of the PCs work OK with the nouveau drivers but are too slow. Noting that Nvidia stopped supporting the 6200 in the 346.35 driver package, I apply the last-supported 304.125 drivers (which are suggested by .02) - after which the PCs boot to the graphical login screen OK - but after login, the desktop / icon colors are wrong (desktop appears black, icons are just black squares with white/blue outlines), and the mouse / keyboard are unresponsive. Tried Ubuntu 15.04 / Nvidia 304.125 to see if anything cleared up - but same issues.  SO I have reverted back to 14.04.01, which works fine with the Nvidia 304.125 drivers, and have turned off software updates, which I hate to do.  Some searching on these forums show I am not alone when it comes to using \"older\" Nvidia cards with 14.04.02 (so much for LTS).  What broke? Thoughts welcome - thanks. \n\nA: After updating to 14.04.2 you should probably take advantage of the hardware enablement stack (I've had pretty good results using nvidia-304 so far):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nTo install the kernel 3.16* version (utopic), do the following:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-304/trusty linux-generic-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-lts-utopic libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-video-all-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-input-all-lts-utopic\n\nTo install the kernel 3.19* version (vivid), do this instead:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-304/trust linux-generic-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-lts-vivid libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-video-all-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-input-all-lts-vivid\n\nor you could install both to find out which gets the best results for you.\nReboot and choose \"advanced options for ubuntu\" when you get to the grub menu. Then, select which kernel to use and press ENTER.\nAdditionally, you can use \nsudo apt-mark hold <packagename> \n\nto prevent upgrades of any specific package so you can keep application version and still allow other system updates.\nTo change things back to default, run:\nsudo apt-mark unhold <packagename>\n\nto unhold the application.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 with 3.19 Kernel Wants to Update to 3.16 I recently updated my kernel to 3.19.0 to resolve some issues with a Dell XPS 9394 ('15), and things are mostly working well, though now software update looks like it wants to download and install headers and images for kernel 3.16. How do I make sure SU is pulling updates for the 3.19 kernel?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: First things first. How did you install kernel 3.19? As you're running a LTS release, the recommended way to install new kernels is by Hardware Enablement. Kernel 3.19 is available in Ubuntu 14.04 repositories. Make sure you have it installed:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\nNow, reboot the computer to load the new kernel. Make sure it is running:\nuname -r\n\nThe above command should return something like 3.19.0-20-generic. Now you can remove older kernels. Start with:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-generic linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic linux-generic-lts-utopic linux-headers-generic-lts-utopic linux-image-generic-lts-utopic linux-signed-generic linux-signed-generic-lts-utopic\n\nThe above should remove the kernel meta packages which install updates for kernels 3.13 and 3.16. At this point, newer releases for kernels 3.13 and 3.16 will not be offered anymore, but the (possible) already installed kernels may receive updates. List the installed kernel packages:\ndpkg -l | grep -E \"linux-(generic|headers|image|signed)\" | colrm 80\n\nIf you see any package with version lower than 3.19, remove it:\nsudo apt-get purge <package name 1> <package name 2> ...\n\n", "Q: mapred-site.xml file not present in Hadoop 2.7.0 I have installed Hadoop 2.7.0 on Ubuntu 14.04. There is no mapred-site.xml file in the hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop directory. But there is a file mapred-site.xml.template in that directory. Are both files the same or is mapred-site.xml file missing? The hadoop-env.sh and core-site.xml files are present in the directory.\n\nA: You need to rename the mapred-site.xml.template file to mapred-site.xml.\n(in hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop)\nFor this, you can use:  \nmv mapred-site.xml.template mapred-site.xml\n\nand then make changes in the configuration file mapred-site.xml as required.\n", "Q: Why does ubuntu installer keep crashing when creating the partitions? I'm trying to install Ubuntu to an ASUS X551MAV that had Windows 8 pre-intalled, unfortunately Windows crashed and I managed to mess it up even more, now I want to install Ubuntu, but it keeps stalling out when it's creating the partitions.  the error is that it can't create the /dev/sda2 partiton and just stalls out, is there any other way I can fix this so it will run correctly?\n\nA: This type of error is usually a hint of a hardware fault. I recommend you run a SMART test on your disk. If you need help interpreting results, post back with details. It could be there's some other fault, though -- either a disk problem that won't show up in SMART (like a cabling or controller problem) or something that's not disk-related (bad RAM, maybe).\n\nA: In addition to Rod Smith's answer, another source of problems during the installation is usually a defective Live CD / DVD. If you can boot into Ubuntu from the Live CD / DVD, check the Live CD / DVD's MD5 hash by running md5sum <optical_drive_block_device>, where <optical_drive_block_device> is the optical drive's block device as listed by lsblk, and check it against the MD5 hash of the image found at releases.ubuntu.com under the name of the Ubuntu release you're trying to install.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04, GT 750M install nvidia 346.72 for CUDA, cudnn, theano I am somewhat new to Ubuntu, therefore I hope that my question is not too silly.\nBasically, I need to install NVIDIA_Linux_x86_64-346.72.run on my laptop (acer v5-573g-54208) to use CUDA, cudnn and theano to speed up convolutional neural network computations (using Lasagne).\nI am trying to solve this problem for a long time now. I have installed the drivers (NVIDIA_Linux_x86_64-346.72.run), but after logging in to ubuntu my screen turns black and I am back at the log-in window.\nIf anyone could help me out on this, I would be very, very grateful! Thank you!\n\nA: I haven't had much luck with the the proprietary drivers, so here is a solution using the modified drivers that should work just as well. Make sure to remove any nvidia drivers or cuda installation before following these instructions.\nInstall the drivers:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-XXX nvidia-prime\n\nRestart your computer and make sure the drivers installed correctly. To check, install nvidia x server settings. If your gpu is found, this software will display information about your graphics card.\nNext install the cuda toolkit from standard repository:\nsudo apt-get install nvdia-cuda-toolkit\n\nThen install the correct cuda library from the repository added earlier:\nsudo apt-get install libcuda1-XXX\nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nXXX in the above code will depend on what graphics card you have. For me (I have an nvidia 970M) it was 346.\nFinally, try running deviceQuery (may have to run as sudo) to see if cuda is installed and finding your gpu.\n\nA: Another possibility is to first install the nvidia driver using apt-get, then download the run file for the cuda version that you need from the nvidia website, and install only cuda and the cuda samples from the run file. For example, for cuda 7.5, this is what I used:\nsudo ./cuda_7.5.18_linux.run --silent --toolkit --samples --samplespath=/usr/local/cuda-7.5/samples --override\n\nThis allows you to use any nvidia driver that you can install using apt-get with any version of cuda. \n", "Q: What kind of partitioning should I chose? I would like to make a new installation of Lubuntu Core\nI will use only Lubuntu Core on this machine.\nI use a HP 6820s \nI will have very few files on HDD, some poor quality movies and some documents. \nI would like to partition the HDD like this:\nHDD 250 GB:\n\n\n*\n\n*20GB - ext4 - / - for the operating system\n\n*4GB - swap \n\n*The rest of 220 GB on 2 equal partitions of ext4.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this the best choice of HDD partitioning for speed? \n\n*Is ext4 the best solution for speed for my hardware configuration and my files? \n\n*If sometimes I will use some files from Windows should I create a FAT32 partition too?\n\n*Will the FAT32 partition make the system slower? If yes, will it help in any way if it will be of only a few GB?\n\n\n\nA: Here are your answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, this is a correct partitioning.\n\n*Ext4 is a default file system and it is optimal for desktop usage.\n\n*If you do not have Windows installed, you do not need to create any Windows partitions.\n\n*Fat32 partition will not make system slower, but I see no reason to create one at all.\n\n\nA: Reformatting slightly, you wrote:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*20GB - ext4 - / - for the operating system\n  \n*4GB - swap\n  \n*The rest of 220 GB on 2 equal partitions of ext4.\n  \n\nYour root (/) and swap selections seem reasonable, with the caveat that your swap space should be at least as large as your RAM if you expect to be able to use a suspend-to-disk operation; thus, 4GiB (but maybe not 4GB -- see here if you don't understand the distinction) should be barely enough if you've got 4GiB of RAM. (Note that RAM is usually mis-specified using SI suffixes, like GB, although it's almost always installed in units better measured by IEEE-1541 suffixes, like GiB.)\nThe reasons you gave for creating two additional partitions (namely, better performance) are unlikely to be valid. Furthermore, the mount points are extremely important for this. I'd recommend putting the rest of your disk space in a single partition and mounting it at /home. An exception would be if you intend to use the system in an unusual way for a laptop. For instance, a server might want a big /var or /srv partition and no separate /home partition. There are reasons to split off various other partitions, but for an average new user, a single big /home partition is fine.\nAs to filesystems, ext4fs is the default and is perfectly reasonable. Other filesystems have their advantages, but optimizing your filesystem choice requires understanding details of your expected use that you haven't provided and that I suspect you don't even know. I'd stick with ext4fs.\nThere are few reasons to create a FAT32 partition on a computer that boots nothing but Ubuntu. Even if you copy files to the laptop that originated on Windows machines, using FAT32 to store them will provide no advantage. FAT32 has several drawbacks, too, including a 4GiB file-size limit, slower performance than most Linux-native filesystems, and lack of Linux permissions and ownership support.\nThe biggest exception to the FAT32 rule is if your computer uses the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) firmware (or its Unified EFI variant, aka EFI 2.x). Such computers use a FAT32 EFI System Partition (ESP) to store the boot loader. Most EFI-based computers can be booted in BIOS mode, though, so even on an EFI-based computer, creating an ESP might not be required. In your case, the link you provided to your computer model suggests that it originally shipped with Windows Vista, which means it's old enough that it almost certainly uses a BIOS, not an EFI, so chances are this doesn't apply to you. I'm mentioning it only in the interest of completeness, and in case somebody else who does have an EFI-based computer reads this post.\n", "Q: sakis3g installation I have gotsakis3g.tar.gz file on my pc but as soon as I try to make this file executable using the command sudo chmod +x sakis3g it shows:\n\nNO SUCH FILE OR DIRECTORY \n\nI have been wanting to use 3g dongle on my pc running UBUNTU 14.04. \n\nA: A .tar.gz file is an archive, not a program - you can't make it executable.\nYou have missed a step in the instructions on the Sakis 3G website. Before chmod, you need to do\n tar -xzvf sakis3g.tar.gz \n\nEdit: \nHOWEVER... please read the comments below from LiveWireBT and consider obtaining this script from an alternative source. \n\nA: If you download the tar.gz file from Sakis3g and run:\n\nsudo tar -xzvf sakis3g.tar.gz\n\nyou are going to get a directory called files with 2 more directories inside it (at least as on June 14,2015, may have been working well before/after today).

I have been using deja-dup GUI for quiet some time and I am very satisfied with it. However, I would also like to execute the same profile via command line. Is that possible?\nIn particular, I would like to make a backup on command line - either through deja-dup or duplicity - with the following setup:\nStorage location\n    Windows Share\n    wdmycloud\n    /USER/backup/deja-dup/T430s/\n    NA\n    NA\nFolders to ignore\n    NA\nFolders to save\n    ~/FOLDER1\n    ~/FOLDER2\n\n\nA: Déjà Dup is a GUI that uses duplicity as the back-end and hence there are only limited command-line options. You can run man deja-dup and see the various options available. For example to start a backup run:\n\ndeja-dup --backup\n\nor to restore a file file:\n\ndeja-dup --restore file\n\n(Note that these commands just invoke the GUI from terminal)\nTo get more powerful options from command-line you should consider installing duplicity which is strictly a CLI.\n", "Q: Freezing with new Plasma 5 I got some freezes with new Plasma on Kubuntu.

Why is this not the case with Firefox. I am just curious as to what programs I need to add the & option to. \n\nA: All programs can be called without &. The & is completely optional. All it does is send the process to the background so you can continue using your terminal. \nWithout it, if you launch a process from the terminal, you will need to wait until that process finishes (or is closed) before being able to continue using your terminal. Therefore, one often runs programs as command & to send them to the background and keep working in the same terminal.\nFor more on the various shell operators like & and what they do, see here. \n\nA: It is very simple for a program to put itself in the background. The code used to do so could be as simple as this:\nif (fork() > 0) _exit(0);\n\nBut doing so by default would introduce a few disadvantages. For example you could no longer wrap the program in a script which does something upon the program terminating. And writing output to the terminal from a background process could end up looking quite messy, terminal output from background processes can be disabled but then the background process will be frozen once it tries to produce output.\nIn my experience Skype and Firefox do not put themselves in the background. They do something different though.\nWhen you start one of these programs they will check if there is already a running instance of the program. If there is a running instance the new instance will send a message to the running instance with the parameter you just gave it, and then quit.\nThe effect of that is that the already running instance does something, and you get your prompt back.\n\nA: This depends entirely on how the software was written, often also depending on the intent with it.\nMost bash (= shell, terminal) utilities are meant to be used \"synchronously\", with these the execution is meant to produce a result; which might be required for the following commands in a script or manual procedure - if the utility (program, software) detaches and leaves you at the prompt immediately you will not know when or if the result is available.\nSkype is not normally used as a command line \"utility\" but rather a tool to handle communication (phone or whatever). And then it is quite handy if it does not block the terminal, if launched from there.\nDetaching from the terminal:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/178587/how-do-i-detach-a-process-from-terminal-entirely\n", "Q: How do I prevent me from changing /etc/hosts I'm trying to fight  my bad habit of wasting time on time-consuming websites such as reddit/liveleak etc.\nThe only thing which seems to work is adding a line like this to my etc/hosts\n127.0.1.1 www.reddit.com \nIt works for a few days but then when i got nothing to do i edit this file and remove this line and start wasting my life again.\nIs it a way to make my etc/hosts file immune to changes that would delete something from it ? (So that i would only be able to add things to it when i stumble upon a website which i think is a potential threat for my time).\nIt is really important for me and i will be extremely grateful for any help.\n\nA: TL;DR Unfortunately, your self-control cannot be configured.\n\nIf you want to prevent yourself from editing this file, it will not be possible as long as you are logged in with your administrator account (sudo rights). Create a new user without administrator privileges and work with this account.\nOr by editing the configuration of your router and forbid it from that side.\n", "Q: HDMI tone output not working with PC audio but with test audio just at the beginning:\nI'm not good in using Ubuntu (i've been using it for app. one moth) so please do not give me any unexplained instructions.

How am I supposed to solve this problem which I have never faced before?\nThis is the error message shown in virtual terminal.\n\n\nA: Looks to me like you have a problem with your disk drive sda1. It's formatted as an ext4 file system and the file system is spitting out errors. \nProbably one way of fixing it would be by copying as much data as you can from the drive and then discarding the drive and putting the data on another one. Expensive and time-consuming. You can try other things, and then YMMV.\nAnother approach would be to try and fix the disk errors using a program like fsck. Just google \"using fsck to fix disc errors\" is probably the quickest way to proceed if you decide to go down that route. The risk (perhaps small) is that the drive will continue to fail and you may lose more data. On the other hand it's not abnormal for drives to fail slowly and in a controlled manner.\nWhat you do next probably depends a lot on how important the data on the drive is, whether or not it has been backed up, how much there is, whether you can afford any system down time etc etc.\n", "Q: Transfer speed are superficial (Extremely high) When I make a file transfer from HDD to pendrive(cheap sandisk USb2.0), Transfer speeds are extremely high (80-250MBps) intially and transfer indication stops(sometimes hangs) at end.

Files that are being copied are transferred to the disk cache first and then in the background the kernel will copy it from the cache to disk.\nTo get your disk cache memory use:\nfree --human\n\nand it'll give you something like:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          3.8G       3.7G       136M       362M        13M       1.6G\n-/+ buffers/cache:       2.0G       1.8G\nSwap:         7.6G        57M       7.6G\n\nIn the above numbers, the cache is 1.6G, so, if no other reading/writing is going on, files copied to an external USB stick below that number will have high transfer speeds and once the cache is full, the copying will drop down to the effective speed of the USB stick...\n", "Q: Samsung laptop running Ubuntu 15.04 shuts down at 30% battery without warning My laptop shuts down suddenly at 30% battery when not charging.

The default response timeout for UDP packets is 30 seconds (or very close to it). So you would just need to allow the answer related packet back in and DROP the rest (the below assumes your external IF is eth0):\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -d your_external_IP_address -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -d your_external_IP_address -j DROP\n\nNote that this not the entire answer.

It said the operation was completed successfully but it hasn't seemed to make any difference. \nI went into the boot order in my BIOS (actually UEFI in this case) and there was something called Ubuntu at the top of it, with Windows Boot Manager below it, followed by the devices in my laptop. I moved it down and exited with saving, but it just seemed to go back to how it was after I exited. \nIf anyone knows how to remove grub please tell me. \nThank you.\n\nA: If you see entries in your firmware's boot manager called ubuntu and Windows Boot Manager, then both Ubuntu and Windows are installed in EFI mode, not in BIOS mode. In EFI mode, boot loaders reside on the EFI System Partition (ESP), not on the MBR of the hard disk. To be sure of this, look for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi in Ubuntu. If it's present, Ubuntu is installed in EFI mode; if it's absent, then Ubuntu is installed in BIOS mode. Windows ties its boot mode to the partition table type, so if the internal disk uses GPT, Windows is installed in EFI mode.\nIf I'm right about this, then moving GRUB to your external disk will require creating an ESP on that disk and copying the boot files over. You'll probably need to use GParted from a live CD to shrink one of your external-disk partitions enough to create an ESP. Make it FAT32 and give it a \"boot flag\" in GParted.\nChances are the ESP on your internal disk is currently mounted at /boot/efi, so if you create an ESP on the external disk and mount it at /mnt, you'd do something like:\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/EFI\nsudo cp -r /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu /mnt/EFI/BOOT\nsudo mv /mnt/EFI/BOOT/shimx64.efi /mnt/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi\n\nThis should render the external disk bootable on any EFI-based computer. You should test this on another computer or by using the built-in boot manager to launch from the external disk before continuing. If you have problems at this point, post back with details.\nOnce GRUB is copied, you can adjust the boot order by using efibootmgr in Ubuntu. First, type sudo efibootmgr alone to see the entries. You can then adjust the boot order with the -o option, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 2,3 to make Boot0002 the first (default) item and Boot0003 the second (non-default entry). The correct boot order for you depends on the entries you see on your system.\nYou can also delete the GRUB files from the ESP -- in /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu, assuming the internal disk's ESP is still mounted at /boot/efi. Do this only if you're 100% sure that you can boot from the boot loader on the external disk. Speaking of which, you should edit your /etc/fstab file to have it mount the ESP on the external disk rather than the internal one.\nNote that GRUB updates will tend to reset GRUB as the default boot loader, so you may need to fix this again. Alternatively, you could uninstall GRUB, but that can be a pain, since Ubuntu will try to re-install it. There are ways around this, but I don't recall the details. (I use a dummy GRUB package, but that's rather inelegant.)\n", "Q: Can't use nvidia GPU optimization (libcublas.so) I have a Nvidia 750Ti on a dedicated server\nI'm trying to install cuda in order to use GPU optimization in Theano.\nI did several cuda 7 installations (on Ubuntu server x86_64 12.04, Ubuntu server x86_64 14.04, installing Nvidia drivers manually...).\nThe current installation is:\n  - Ubuntu 14.04 (updated)\n  - cuda 6.5 (via .run)\nAfter each installation I try the first GPU example in this tutorial but I keep getting the same response:\nTHEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python check1.py\nERROR (theano.sandbox.cuda): Failed to compile cuda_ndarray.cu: libcublas.so.6.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nWARNING (theano.sandbox.cuda): CUDA is installed, but device gpu is not available  (error: cuda unavilable)\n[Elemwise{exp,no_inplace}(<TensorType(float32, vector)>)]\nLooping 1000 times took 1.9148170948 seconds\nResult is [ 1.23178029  1.61879337  1.52278066 ...,  2.20771813  2.29967761\n  1.62323284]\nUsed the cpu\n\n\n$ ls -la /usr/local/cuda-6.5/lib64/libcublas.so\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 Jun 14 18:23 /usr/local/cuda-6.5/lib64/libcublas.so -> libcublas.so.6.5\n\nI compiled the nvidia cuda examples.

For some reason the wlan0 was capped at 2304, if I try  sudo ifconfig wlan0 mtu X for anything higher I get the error message SIOCSIFMTU: Invalid argument. For the ppp0, however I managed to set almost anything (tried with 30000 and works). Nevertheless, this did not help resolve the issue. So here I am wondering if there is any change for me?\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 with kernel 3.17.\n\nA: Okay so after some more digging and lot's of experimentation it turns out I have to in fact lower the MTU of wlan0, rather than increase it. The reason, as far as I understood and please correct if I'm wrong, is that probably one of routers or a switch on the way is having a lower MTU as well, thus although it sends the packets correctly, my guess is that the VPN server sees only the MTU from the VPN packets, and replies with that MTU. When they hit this router it just gives up, because the incoming packet is too big. Again that is my hypothesis on the issue. How much to lower it, I can not say exactly. I did first 1412, than 1400 and 1200 in the end it was most stable at 1000 so I stick with that. If it happens to you just experiment a bit with it.\n\nA: I had this issue few minutes ago and that`s how I have solved it:\nsudo ifconfig ppp0 mtu 1300\n\nThis command has changed MTU size for ppp0 connection at this session only.\nIf you want to use permanently this settings for your connection, create a new file in /etc/network/if-up.d/ directory\nExample:\n sudo vi /etc/network/if-up.d/ppp0-mtu\n\nwith the content:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ \"$IFACE\" = \"ppp0\" ]; then\n    sudo ifconfig ppp0 mtu 1300\nfi\n\nmake this file executable and check your VPN connection now\nsudo chmod a+x /etc/network/if-up.d/ppp0-mtu\n\n\nA: You can use traceroute to discover the lower mtu in the path to the host.\nthe command is:\ntraceroute <host> --mtu\nIn my case the lower MTU was 1280, so I used 1200 to make the vpn in the router configuration.\n", "Q: error installing kubuntu 14.04.1 desktop-amd64 on vbox Trying to create a virtual machine using this downloaded 'kubuntu-14.04.1-desktopamd64.iso' virtual disk image.

I suspect your .iso is damaged. Re-download and try again (version 15 is out now also.) In VBox, make sure you pick Linux, then Ubuntu as the type of VM.\nEdit: I just tried with lubuntu-15.04-desktop-i386.iso and VirtualBox 4.3.28, and received this lovely output. This was after the GUI installation finished and it went to reboot:\n\nReset the VM and it appears to be working. This is strange because lubuntu 14.04 was tested just last month and there was not a single issue. Note, I enabled \"PAE/NX\" in the VM settings before starting it, gave it two CPU cores, and 2048 megabytes of RAM.\nJust tested with Kubuntu 15.04 x32, with PAE/NX turned on, two CPU cores, 2048MB. Booted right up, installed everything including updates and extra features, worked fine. However, it too, \"hung\" during reboot (no output), and a reset got it working again. Ran the Muon update manager, installed a slew of new updates. So I do think either your downloaded .iso is corrupt, or in a rare case, virtualbox is misbehaving.\n\nNote that unless you're giving a VM more than 4GB of RAM (or using it to code 64-bit apps), there isn't much point to using a 64-bit guest OS. Try the 32-bit version instead.\n", "Q: How do I change user ownership I recently fat-fingered a permissions change in my /home/randy folder.

It's GRUB2 what can do this thing on my system, but I don't know what to write and where in the configuration files. And I want this setting to be permanent.\nI wanna give the laptop to my son, he plays flash games in browser anyways. I read that the 10_LINUX file should be modified in /etc/grub.d folder.\nCan anybody help me out with this? \nI'm new to this, forgive if I asked stupid things. \n\nA: You can get around the missing ID pin on Dell Laptop chargers by adding (as root) processor.ignore_ppc=1 to your GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line in your /etc/default/grub file.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"processor.ignore_ppc=1\"\n\nafterwards run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nthen reboot.\nNote: this will allow your normal CPU frequency scaling to work properly, just as if the ID were working properly, but does not always force the maximum CPU frequency.\nNote: Use this at your own risk. It disables the BOIS limiting the CPU frequency, which is a most primitive level of protection.\n", "Q: Why is wget not calling my entire web address?

It doesn't show up in the gvfs folder either. Is there any way to have it mount automatically?\n\nA: Your camera does not support being mounted as a USB Mass Storage device, however it does support MTP/PTP.\nThis will allow it to show up in gthumb and other image viewers or camera import tools that use gphoto2.\nIt will also allow it to appear by default in Nautilus, but it sounds like Thunar does not include support for MTP devices by default.\nAccording to this discussion, you will need to install the package gvfs-backends (which you may already have).  That will install the ability to mount MTP devices on the filesystem but it doesn't magically teach Thunar how to mount/unmount them.\nFor that you'll need some other tool to mount/unmount them, and apparently people have had success with gmtp.  An alternative was go-mtpfs but someone said that didn't work out.\nIf this is too difficult you could just install nautilus and use that instead of Thunar when you want to access the contents of MTP devices.\n", "Q: Trying to uninstall Bitwig from my computer with the .deb package missing I am trying to uninstall Bitwig from my computer and I'm not sure as to how.

I've installed it a few weeks ago, and it's the only operating system in my computer.\nNow I would like to install Windows 8.1 in dual boot with Ubuntu, and in order to do so, I need first to reserve some space in the Hard Drive for the Windows installation.\nThe problem is that through Gparted I was unable to reduce my current Ubuntu partition, as it says it to be full, when it actually isn't (it has around around 600GB free). The option to resize is available, though the maximum and minimum sizes are equal to it's total size. I've tried booting Ubuntu and running Gparted from a live USB, but was unable to reduce the partition because of the same problem.\nSince I'm new to the forum, I don't have enough \"reputation\" to post pictures, but for those who might help and would like to take a look, I've uploaded a screenshot of Gparted on this link:\n\nWhat could be the reason Gparted sees the partition as full, and how could I reduce my volume in order to make room for Windows?\nObs: I saw some forums where they said to edit the partition using LVM, though it did not run once installed (graphical errors I think), but even when using it, would I be able to create a primary partition for Windows?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you are using LVM, so this is not just as simple as resizing a partition in gparted.\nWhat you are seeing in gparted is not a plain partition but an LVM physical volume.  This is an area of space on the disk reserved for LVM to put its logical volumes.  Then, inside those logical volumes are the partitions your system uses.  However, gparted doesn't see these, it just sees one big physical volume which it doesn't know how to edit or move.  Instead, you use the LVM tools to see and manage the logical volumes inside.\nThe good news is that you can resize and physically move around your logical volumes quite easily using LVM and you can even do this while the system is running.  The bad news is that actually moving or resizing the LVM physical volume around them is quite difficult.\nThe \"LVM way\" of doing this would be to set up a new physical volume on a new drive, add it to the same volume group, then live migrate the logical volume to the other drive.  Then, with the physical volume on the original drive now unused, you can remove it from the volume group, and then you can trash that physical volume and re-create it.  The reason I call this the \"LVM way\" of doing it is that it ensures zero downtime - it can be done on a live system, especially if it has the ability to hotswap in a new drive.  Of course, the downside of doing all this is that it's really slow to migrate all that to a second drive, and that it requires a second drive, so the main benefit is only to people who want to do it on a live system without shutting down.\nThat said, if you are confident with messing with the partition table yourself, you can take a short-cut, with the help from the pvresize tool which can resize an LVM physical volume (but only if you also change its size in the partition table manually).  It's not an easy process.  You'll first need to shrink the filesystem in the logical volume, then shrink its logical volume to match, and migrate the remaining extent so that the free space in the volume group is all at the end of that physical volume if necessary.  The included LVM tools will help this far.  Then, work out how much you can shrink the physical volume, change its size in the partition table and simultaneously update its size in LVM with pvresize.\nThe exact procedure is detailed here:\nhttps://serverfault.com/a/419279\nIf you do go this route, I'd recommend a backup because it will be very easy to screw up and lose data.  And if you're doing a backup anyway, you may as well just do things the old fashioned way and copy everything off the drive, delete the partition and start again, then copy everything back instead.\nIt's reasons like this I don't recommend LVM for anyone, unless they know they need it and can deal with this stuff.  If you don't absolutely need to be able to hotswap in a new drive, migrate one or more partitions to it, deactivate and remove the old drive, all on a live system without shutting down or rebooting, then (in my opinion) LVM is not really relevant to your needs, and the old fashioned way (plain partitions) will be easier, due to fewer levels of abstraction (easier to get your head around) and tools like gparted which can easily modify and resize them.\n", "Q: How to broadcast two access points?

It will erase everything on disk and install ubuntu only).  That should automatically 'define' the root filesystem for you.

I have a gaming mouse and it's way too high sensitivity in Ubuntu compared to Windows.\nThe output of xinput list gives me:\n\nVirtual core pointer                        id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SteelSeries Rival Gaming Mouse            id=8    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SteelSeries Rival Gaming Mouse            id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nHow would I go about lowering the sensitivity even further? Any other options I should consider with a gaming mouse?\n\nA: I think I found the answer, but not sure how to make it permanent(I think it resets on reboot?)\nFirst, do the above xinput list and get the id of your device. Not sure why, but there are 2 mice coming up with id=8 and id=10. I picked 8, and it worked.\nI ran the following line xinput --set-prop \"8\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 1.5, with the value of 1.5 being just tested and I found it pretty nice. Depends on mouse, so test different values etc. \nHowever I guess you should create a bash script for this for it to work on startup. Not sure how to do so, but will figure it out I guess. \n\nA: I don't have enough rep to comment unfortunately, you simply open the startup applications app and add the command as /usr/bin/xinput  --set-prop \"8\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 1.5.

Regex [[:alpha:]] is used to consider alphabetical scrings and alphabetical strings with comas as variables, hence var_num gets incremented; if there's no lines that match that pattern, var_num is not incremented\nORIGINAL\nHere's my awk one-liner:\nawk 'BEGIN {var_num=0} /VARIABLES/,/}/ {sub(\"{\",\"\");sub(\"}\",\"\");sub(\"VARIABLES\",\"\"); var_num+=1} END{ print var_num}' test-text.txt\nBasic idea: create variable var_num, tell awk to read everything between lines containing VARIABLES string and curly brace }. Get rid of that string, all the curly braces, and we only have strings that represent variables. Add 1 for each line to var_num. In the end - print the total of counted variables.\nThe reason for deleting VARIABLES and curly braces, is that we don't want to count lines that contain only VARIABLE string or the curly brace. So we need to make sure they're gone.\nAnother pattern that I've noticed is that each variable is coma-separated. Thus you could use an if statement , something like if ($0~/,/) { var_num+=1 }\n", "Q: Blank Screen after logged in (only desktop wallpaper showing) When I logged in to my Ubuntu, it shows blank screen (showing only desktop wallpaper, not black screen).

You could check what it is doing by activating the log file, but I think that you should update the version first because 1.17 is ancient.\nThere are up to date packages for recoll on the recoll backports PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~recoll-backports/+archive/ubuntu/recoll-1.15-on\nOnce you have upgraded, you should stop the old indexer, delete your index: rm -rf ~/.recoll/xapiandb and rebuild it with the new version.\nIf the problem persists at this point, please use one of the recoll normal support channels, for example, open an issue on bitbucket:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/issues?status=new&status=open\n\nA: I am using recoll Recoll 1.24.3 + Xapian 1.4.12\nI have 32Gb of RAM, an x360 AMD 5200U GPU with 8 processors and it does indeed hog my system.\nMy solution is to run it with nice\n\nsudo apt install nice\n\nand start recoll (I use the gui, then start update index from the menu)  with\n\nnice -n -10 recoll\n\nthat brings it down from 100% to 12% of the cpu.\nmore about nice here\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-of-process-in-linux-nice-value/\n-n values \n-20   most priority  process\n20   least priority process\nyou can change the nice value of a running process with\n\nrenice -15 \n\nwhere pid is the process id.\nand alternative is to get the pid from the name\n\nrenice -15 $(pidof recoll)\n\nrenice needs sudo privileges though\n", "Q: Can't install or remove packages I'm getting this error:\ndpkg: unrecoverable fatal error, aborting:\n files list file for package `linux-image-extra-3.13.0-39-generic' contains empty filename\n\nI think it might have some thing to do with an old kernel, but I can't uninstall it with sudo apt-get remove or purge since it keeps erroring.\n\nA: You can also try the following:\n\nrm /var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-image-extra-3.13.0-39-generic.list\n\nThen update your system.\n\nA: Try this solution:\ncd /var/lib/dpkg\n\nBackup:\nsudo cp diversions diversions.bak\nsudo cp diversions-old diversions-old.bak\n\nThen make diversions back to old:\nsudo cp diversions-old diversions\n\nNow try update:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen re-install your package:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall packagename\n\n\nAnother possible solution: Quoted from http://www.richud.com/wiki/Ubuntu_Dpkg:_unrecoverable_fatal_error\nsudo gedit -w /var/lib/dpkg/status \n\nRemove the whole section of linux-image-extra-3.13.0-39-generic\nThen run\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nYou should then get still the initial errors \"dpkg: warning: files list file for package `xxxxxxxxxxx' missing\nNow run\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nYet again you should see \"dpkg: warning: files list file for package `xxxxxxxxxxx' missing, assuming package has no files currently installed.\".\nNow do this replacing xxxxxxx with all the package names above that appear.\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall xxxxxxxxxx\n\n", "Q: How to move Unity Launcher on boot automatically?

Changing the font doesn't work. Native applications like Gedit though having the same font are not affected (nor are non-Swing Java-applications like Eclipse); its only affecting Swing-based applications.\nScreenshots:\n(jEdit v5.1)\n\nI'm running Ubuntu 15.04 (which is the latest version as of 2015-06-15).

I've also added the following lines in the /etc/environment (as given here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Java_Runtime_Environment_Fonts) but they are not giving me any apparent results.\nJAVA_FONTS=/usr/share/fonts/truetype\n_JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on'\n\nI'm sure there must be a fix for this. The same Java-Applications are working as they should on Windows-7.\n\nA: This problem has long been fixed so I decided I should post the solution. Note that the problem is still there by default but it can be fixed by a parameter.\nAdding this line:\n_JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true'\n\nto /etc/environment fixes the issue.\nThis fix works as of Ubuntu 16.04 and OpenJDK 8u151 (haven't checked with Oracle JDK or Java 9).\nWorking example:\n\nNote: Some fonts and AA settings complicate the problem. In jEdit, I use the default Java fonts (\"Dialog\" as it's called) for everything. You can probably use a different font for the Text-Area but Dialog is the best for buttons, etc. The best Text-Area AA setting I've found is standard but your mileage may vary.\n", "Q: Package listed in .manifest is not installed with OS After visiting How do I list the default installed packages?, I read ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-i386.manifest   and found (Ctrl+F) that it lists gparted 0.18.0-1 but (we know that) gparted is not installed by default!\nHowever, Gparted is installed when try Ubuntu (using Live CD Environment) hence seems to be removed while installing system.\nSo, I want to know Why package listed in .manifest is not installed with OS?\n\nA: The manifest says what's on the CD.

Finally, we print the result within  END code block.\n$ perl -lane '$j=0;foreach $i (@F){$sum[$j]+=$i; $j+=1;}; END{print join(\"\\n\",@sum)} ' input.txt                                                     \n8\n11\n7\n5\n\nAlternatively, here's a full Perl script approach. It relies on splitting each line into array, and iterating over each item in that array adding each number to their respective possition in @sums array.

Is it possible that when I add a ppa of such an app at later time ubuntu will update my app.\nCommon examples are apps such as wine, google chrome, etc.\n\nA: Yes, if you install something via the package management system (dpkg and apt), when you apt upgrade or apt dist-upgrade it will look at all your locally defined sources (PPAs, official repos, local caches, CDs etc) and attempt to install the latest version of all packages.\napt upgrade will only upgrade something if it doesn't require installing extra packages, or removing some. Only apt dist-upgrade (or the newer apt full-upgrade) will do that.\nIf you want to avoid that, you can \"pin\" the package to avoid updates.\n\nIf you install it via another method (eg sudo make install), unless you've also installed it via package management (seriously not recommended), dist- upgrade will either overwrite or install alongside.\nThings you install manually tend to go into .../local/... or /opt/... directories to avoid direct clashes but this can mean you have more than one version of something installed at once.\n\nA: If you have downloaded and installed an DEB from a PPA-Page and add the PPA later, your apps will be updated.\n", "Q: How to tell if I have a firewall installed on my VM I inherited a college VM I am trying to setup to accept remote connections to its MySQL DB from my local phpMyAdmin\nI am going through some SO Questions and tutorials (this/this) on setting this up all of which mention that I need to make sure my firewall is configured properly to allow connections though\nI am continuously learning Linux/VMs and have little or no experience with Firewalls\nIs there a command that will tell me if there is any Firewall already installed on my VM?\nThanks\nname@vm-18:/$ uname -a\nLinux kdeg-vm-18 3.2.0-37-virtual #58-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 24 15:48:03 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n\nname@vm-18:/$ cat /etc/*-release\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=12.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=precise\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS\"\nNAME=\"Ubuntu\"\nVERSION=\"12.04.5 LTS, Precise Pangolin\"\nID=ubuntu\nID_LIKE=debian\nPRETTY_NAME=\"Ubuntu precise (12.04.5 LTS)\"\nVERSION_ID=\"12.04\"\n\n\nA: Most of the time, whatever the firewall tool you use, the low level firewalling stuff is made with iptables.\nSo with iptables -L, you should be able to tell if there is a firewall running.

Say I've accidentally uninstalled every terminal emulator on my system: xterm, uxterm, gnome-terminal, guake, etc. Is there a way I can access bash without a terminal emulator?\nOne possible way I can think of would be to create and run a shell script, but that aside, can I get an interactive shell?\nThis is purely hypothetical, but thanks for all the answers!\n\nA: \nYes, by pressing CtrlAltF21. That gives you access to virtual console TTY2 . And you can reinstall any terminal emulator from there with sudo apt-get install terminal-name, where terminal-name is, gnome-terminal for example.\nTo get back to the GUI, first type exit to log out of the virtual console, then press CtrlAltF7 to switch back to the GUI. (In case you want to keep TTY session open, skip the typing  exit part)\nEdit: June 17,2015\nI've thought up another solution: if you have any C language IDE, you could compile the following code, and the console of the IDE will now give you access to bash\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nvoid main()\n{\n        system(\"bash\");\n}\n\n\nNote: CtrlAltF2 is not the only option. You can use CtrlAltF1, CtrlAltF3, CtrlAltF4, CtrlAltF5 and CtrlAltF6 too, which will give you virtual console TTY1, TTY3, TTY4, TTY5 or TTY6 respectively.\n\nA: Although all answers above is perfect, and since you are using Linux, then you have many other possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtual ttys as described in @serg answer which is the perfect solution\n\n*SSH as described in @A.B solution which is lovely trick, but you have to take in consideration to have openssh server running.\n\n*Another possible solutions(it's not the perfect but just to show other possibilities): LiveCD , Recovery Mode\n\nA: If you have an ssh server running, than you can connect via ssh from another system.\nssh <your_remote_user_name>@<your_remote_host>\n\nIf I install a system, then I first install and start the SSH server. A kind of life insurance. =)\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+(F1 through F4 at least, maybe up to F6) run a terminal interface on the virtual consoles.  Once there, to get back to the GUI, use Ctrl+Alt+F7.\nIf you do any of those, you should be able to get to a terminal you can login to and then access the terminal.  Bash scripts will, however, continue to run, if they're automated scripts dropped into cron and such or double clicked to run (but not in terminal).  The terminal emulators which 'give you' an interactive shell, but ultimately bash, zsh, etc. which are the actual shells still exist and can run either via cron, scripts, and even the virtual consoles on the keyboard combos above.\nNote though that if your scripts need the interactive interface, you'll have to use the virtual consoles, or install an emulator again.\n\nA: So I am going to be pedantic here:\n\nIs there a way I can access bash without a terminal emulator?\n\nSure any script that begins with #!/bin/bash will do that.\nIs there a way I can get a bash prompt without a terminal emulator?\nContinuing with my theme of being pedantic, lets poke some holes in some of the other answers.\n\nSay I've accidentally uninstalled every terminal emulator on my system:\n\nThis is actually very hard to pull off because\n\nby pressing CtrlAltF2\n\nyou switch to another virtual console which has the linux kernel virtual terminal emulator running on it, which is very hard to remove and requires recompiling the kernel with nonstandard options. So lets blow holes in the ssh/telnet/serial-port options, those require a remote terminal emulator; as for webmin, it also has a terminal emulator (just a lousy one). \nThere is only one way to use the function of a terminal without a terminal emulator: use a real terminal. I used to have a Televideo and a teletype (not a TeleType, this was a knockoff) I was able to edit files with both (vi on the Televideo, ed on the teletype (what a pain in the rear)) make calls out to a local bbs using minicom and seyon from the televideo. You know the only thing I miss about them is the bragging rights, but I picked up a couple configuration terminals for industrial printers that have a two line 20 column display, a keyboard and a rs232 interface that will work for emergency configuration repair once I figure out where my ed manual is.\n\nA: If this is a question from a test, for completeness i'd add normal serial tty's, where you'd connect to your computer with a serial cable.  you'd need a getty (or whatever tty serial listeners are called now) previously configured before you lost your terminal tho, and you'd need a second computer to talk to the first, so as a home emergency this is not likely to happen.\nYou may also have some webmin console that gives you (in effect) shell access, though not techncally interactive shell. at that point you're better off doing easy commands, like apt-get some-terminal-emulator.\nIf you have a browser window open, you could in theory search for a java terminal emulator but my guess is that you'd have to install ahead of time, and just having a browser window wouldn't let you access the underlying pty's right, but I have no time to test either way.\nso, the above are \"what are all the possible ways\" questions, not necessarily useful in real life for home, though most server rooms would probably have serial access.\nhmm, a lot of other tools (emacs, vim, etc) allow some level of shelling out.  lets hope you have xemacs open\n\nA: Similar to @A.B.'s answer, if you have a web server running (I believe stanard Ubuntu comes with apache), you could run a shell in your own browser with something like phpshell.\nPersonally, I'd just fire up emacs and M-x shell RETURN.\n", "Q: My wireless card doesnot support AP mode.

We have added Firefox to the startup application. the browser does open up but not into full screen mode. There are 2 arrows next to the Firefox browser and if you right click on this icon you can see it has opened up. How do I fix this?\n\nA: For complete fullscreen, you can add -fullscreen to the end of your startup command.\nThe other alternative is to just open Firefox, maximize the window, then close the window manually. From now on, it should re-open maximized.\n\nA: I suggest using xdotool and changing the startup command to \nsh -c 'setsid firefox; sleep 3; xdotool key F11'\n\nThe xdotool utility emulates keypresses, so you're effectively saying \"open firefox,wait 3 seconds, simulate pressing F11 key to enter full screen\". The setsid firefox is necessary to start firefox as a session leader and detach from sh, to allow other commands to execute. \nThis of course relies on the assumption that within 3 seconds of starting the  command, firefox will be the foreground window; otherwise xdotool will send F11 keypress to whatever toplevel window is at that moment. To cover all possible corner cases, a much longer script could be needed.\nAdjust the sleep seconds accordingly to match how long your firefox takes to start.\n", "Q: Condition that matches all occurrences of a word in a file ad does something I am to do something like this \nfor (( every occurrence of the word TRAP-TYPE in a file )) \ndo \ndesc=\"$(< inputfile awk '/DESCRIPTION/ {getline; gsub(/^\\s*\"/, \"\"); gsub(/\"\\s*$/, \"\"); print}')\"\n\ncasenum=\"$(< inputfile awk '/::=/ {gsub(/^\\s*::=\\s*/, \"\"); gsub(/\\s*$/, \"\"); print}')\"\n\necho $desc $numvar $casenum \ndone\n\nIt will search for every occurrence of TRAP-TYPE.\nAny language will do!\nINPUT \n\nsCSISmart20   TRAP-TYPE\n          ENTERPRISE  cyclone\n          DESCRIPTION\n          \"Aspi: unable to read the file server hard disk might have problems\"\n          --#TYPE \"Aspi: unable to read the database file\"\n          --#SUMMARY \"ASPI: unable to read the file, server hard disk may have                                                              problems\"\n          --#ARGUMENTS {}\n          --#SEVERITY WARNING\n          --#TIMEINDEX 100\n          --#STATE OPERATIONAL\n          --#HELP \"scsismrt.hlp\"\n          --#HELPTAG 124\n      ::=  124                                                                                            \nsCSISmart21    TRAP-TYPE\n          ENTERPRISE  cyclone\n          DESCRIPTION\n          \"Aspi: database is corrupted\"\n          --#TYPE \"Aspi: database is corrupted\"\n          --#SUMMARY \"ASPI: database file is corrupted\"\n          --#ARGUMENTS {}\n          --#SEVERITY WARNING\n          --#TIMEINDEX 100\n          --#STATE OPERATIONAL\n          --#HELP \"scsismrt.hlp\"\n          --#HELPTAG 125\n      ::=  125                                  \nsCSISmart12    TRAP-TYPE\n      ENTERPRISE  cyclone\n      VARIABLES {cycHostAdapterNumber, cycScsiTargetID, cycLun, cycVendor,        cycProduct, cycSenseInfo}\n      DESCRIPTION\n      \"The HostAdapter# %d, TargetID %d, Lun# %d has Predictive Failure          Condition on vendor %s product %s with sense info MSB(sense code), next  8 bits (sense code Qual) next 8 bits (Add sense code Qual) LSB (0000) %d\"\n      --#TYPE \"Device has SMART/Predicictive failure event\"\n      --#SUMMARY \"The HostAdapter# %d , TargetID %d, Lun# %d has Predictive Failure Condition on vendor %s product %s with senseinfo %d\"\n      --#ARGUMENTS {0,1,2,3,4,5}\n      --#SEVERITY INFORMATIONAL\n      --#TIMEINDEX 100\n      --#STATE OPERATIONAL\n      --#HELP \"scsismrt.hlp\"\n      --#HELPTAG 116\n  ::=  116                                                        \n\nOUTPUT \nAspi: unable to read the file server hard disk might have problems             \n124\nAspi: database is corrupted            \n125 \n\nSorry for the misunderstanding.

I will keep on editing this answer to include how you can assign exctracted data to variables.\nOne approach is to use awk's system function, that will allow running shell commands with variables passed by awk. In this function, the command has to be within double quotes, and awk's internal variables outside the quotes. For example something like this :\nawk '{ if($0~/DESCRIPTION/){getline;printf $0\"|\"}; if($0~/::=/) printf $2\"\\n\"}' *.test | awk -F'|' '{ STRING=$1;NUM=$2; system(\"echo this is the NUMBER \"NUM\" and this is the TEXT  \"STRING)   }'\n\nOutput:\nthis is the NUMBER 124 and this is the TEXT Aspi: unable to read the file server hard disk might have problems\nthis is the NUMBER 125 and this is the TEXT Aspi: database is corrupted\nthis is the NUMBER 134 and this is the TEXT Aspi: second file\nthis is the NUMBER 135 and this is the TEXT Aspi: i love awk\n\nOne possible way of assigning output to variables would be with two parralel arrays. \n$   IFS=\"|\"; STRING_ARRAY=($(awk ' /DESCRIPTION/ {getline;printf \"%s|\",$0}; /::=/ { printf $2\"\\n\" }' trapfile.txt | awk -F'|' '{printf \"%s|\",$1}'))\n\n$ echo ${STRING_ARRAY[*]}\n    \"Aspi: unable to read the file server hard disk might have problems\"     \"Aspi: database is corrupted\"     \"Aspi: second file\"     \"Aspi: i love awk\"\n\nThere, I've used internal field separator IFS | and created strings array as processed by the two awk commands. Now that STRING_ARRAY can be used in a for loop. To output the appropriate numbers to an array:\n$ IFS=\"|\"; NUMS_ARRAY=($(awk ' /DESCRIPTION/ {getline;printf \"%s|\",$0}; /::=/ { printf $2\"\\n\" }' trapfile.txt | awk -F'|' '{printf \"%s|\",$2}'))\n\n$ echo ${NUMS_ARRAY[*]}\n124 125 134 135\n\nNow we have two parrallel arrays, with each index matching string and number from each occurrence in any file\nNotice that the code in the first pipe is the same, so we can simplify this, by making an awk script:\n#!/usr/bin/awk -f\n# Author: SergKolo\n# Date: June 16,2015\n# Written for: http://askubuntu.com/q/636705/295286\n# Awk script to extract text\n# between two specific strings\n# in a file\n\n\n{\n\n          if($0~/DESCRIPTION/)\n          {\n            getline;printf \"%s|\",$0\n          }; \n\n          if($0~/::=/) { printf $2\"\\n\" }\n\n}\n\nSave that script in a file with some name , chmod +x scriptname.awk. Now those long commands simplify as:\n$ IFS=\"|\"; LINES_ARRAY=($(trap-script.awk trapfile.txt | awk -F'|' '{printf \"%s|\",$1}' ))\nAnd\n$ IFS=\"|\"; NUMBERS_ARRAY=($(trap-script.awk trapfile.txt | awk -F'|' '{printf \"%s|\",$2}' ))\nNote: because out of our conversation in the comments it became apparent that some of your files contain lines that have %d and %s format , characters, I've included printf \"%s|\",$0  likes in the code for a reason. When printf function expands a line $0 and sees those format characters it assumes that there must be input for them, instead of treating it as one long string. printf \"%s|\",$0 allows treating those %d characters as text, not as something that needs input. \n\nA: Another awk solution:\n$ gawk -F '\\n *' -v RS=\"::=[^\\n]*\\n*\" '{gsub(/[^0-9]/,\"\", RT); printf \"%s\\n%s\\n\", $4, RT}' foo\n\"Aspi: unable to read the file server hard disk might have problems\"                           \n124\n\"Aspi: database is corrupted\"                                                  \n125\n\nThe text naturally divides into records, but the record separator is not very straightforward. It could be two consecutive newlines. I decided to use the last field in the record (::= ...), followed by arbitrarily many newlines, as the record separator.\nThen, for splitting on fields, I used a newline followed by arbitrarily many spaces. After that, it's just a matter of printing the fourth field, and extracting the numbers from the record separator text (RT). Because this solution uses RT, it is GNU awk-only.\n\nA: In your scenario, the occurences of a word could be found with\nawk, grep, and sed; but you would have to incase those in a bash script\nwith some a case statement and an iteration. It can be done. Writing a Perl, Python, Java, or C++ program seems like a better way to go about it.\nI just wrote this for you. This is a c++ program.\nCopy and paste the program below into gedit. Save it as findword.cpp.\nNOTE: you need to build-essential to compile it.\n:~$ sudo apt-get install build-essential -y\n\n:~$ g++ -o findword findword.cpp\n\nThe program: \n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <string>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <locale>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    string wordhold = \"\";\n    int index;\n    string line;\n    string trptype = \"TRAP-TYPE\";\n\n    ifstream infile;\n    infile.open(\"Yourfile.txt\"); // change Yourfile.txt to the name of the file\n\n    while ( getline(infile, line) ) {\n\n        index = line.find('\\n');\n        string holdword = line.substr(0,index);\n        wordhold = holdword;\n\n        if ( wordhold.compare(wordhold.size(),9,trptype) == 0 ) {\n\n            system(\"Execute the command you want inside the quotes\");\n            wordhold = \"\";\n\n        }\n        else {\n\n            wordhold = \"\";\n\n        }\n\n    }\n    infile.close();\n\n    cout << \"The file is closed\\nDone\" << endl;\n\n    return 0;   \n}\n\nBy the you can run multiple commands by duplicating the system function that is in the condition statement (if).\nTo run the program enter the directory you compiled in and execute it from command line.\n:~$ ./findword\n\nGood luck.\n\nA: Using awk:\n< inputfile awk '/DESCRIPTION/ {getline;

I can pair the device with no problem and it even displays the name of the device as \"MX Anywhere 2\" but it doesn't seem to actually identify the actual device as anything. Using blueman it shows as an \"unknown\" type and within the system bluetooth manager it displays the type as \"unknown\" as well. Any suggestions?\n\nA: UPDATE FOR >15.10:\nIn my original answer I said that the problem would most likely be fixed when 15.10 comes around. While 15.10 does indeed have bluez 5, there is still some problem with pairing. Honestly, it was quite a while since I fixed this problem myself, but if I remember correctly, the MX Master (MX Anywhere 2) uses a PIN-less pairing method which isn't quite properly implemented yet in Ubuntu. Here are some commands which you can use as a quick fix:\nhciconfig hci0 sspmode 1\nhciconfig hci0 down\nhciconfig hci0 up\n\nIf you're using another Bluetooth device than hci0, you obviously have to change that part of the commands, otherwise, they should be good to go. You'll also have to run them each time you restart and therefore I recommend you either have them in an accessible script or that you add them to startup applications. I should also note that I have since been able to get the mouse working even without running these commands after rebooting, so only use them if you have to.\nORIGINAL ANSWER (for < 15.10)\nAnswer taken from here: https://askubuntu.com/a/660666/256078\nWhat's happening is that the MX Anywhere 2 requires Bluetooth Smart and Ubuntu ships with bluez (the Bluetooth driver) 4 which does not have support for Bluetooth Smart. Bluez 5, which adds support for Bluetooth Smart, is supposed to start shipping with 15.10, but for now, you'll have to install bluez 5 manually if you want to use it.\nJust a heads up, if you want to have a stable system, DON'T DO THIS. First of all, this will break the built in Bluetooth control in the settings panel. This method that I'm about to describe adds a PPA too, which is supposed to be bad for your system when upgrading and stuff. Only do this if you know how to remove a PPA and revert to bluez 4 or if you just don't care and want to get it working. ;P\nFirst, you need to add a PPA with bluez 5. I would recommend the bluez 5 PPA made by Austin since that's the one I have used before. Add it with this command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:vidplace7/bluez5\n\nThen refresh apt-get:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAfter that you can install bluez 5 with this command:\nsudo apt-get install bluez\n\nNow that you have bluez 5, you need a way of controlling Bluetooth since, as stated earlier, the built in control panel will not work anymore.\nThere are two ways which I have tried for this. If you want to have a GUI then Blueman is your best option. You can install it simply with:\nsudo apt-get install blueman\n\nThis will install the Blueman Bluetooth interface which you can open for your app launcher. It should be straight forward to use and not require any in depth explanation.\nThe method I recommend however is to use the command line. I found this to be much more stable (worked on login screen while Blueman didn't) and actually surprisingly intuitive to use for being a command line.\nThe way it works is that you type bluetoothctl in to the command line where you'll now have a command interface to interact with Bluetooth devices. You can type help to get a list of commands and what they do. The command that you'll want to use first for pairing the MX Anywhere 2 is the scan command. If you type scan on, your computer will start searching for Bluetooth devices. While in this mode, put your MX Anywhere 2 in to pairing mode and wait for it to show up in the console. It will show up something like this:\n[NEW] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX MX Anywhere 2 (The name may not be accurate)\n\nThe \"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\" string is the MAC address of your MX Anywhere 2. To pair it and connect it, type:\npair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\nconnect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n\nMake sure to change all the \"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\" to the MAC address you got when scanning.\nDone.\n", "Q: About downloading Now, I confess to being both confused and a little put out here.\nI made a donation whilst arranging to download Ubuntu.

I use a script (which I have successfully used before) to that effect.\nNow the kernel won't start. It shows:\nLoading Linux <my version string>\nLoading initial ramdisk\n\non a Ubuntu purple background, then switches to black screen and no more.\nThe strange thing is that I can't seem to access the bootloader to choose the older kernel.\nI could start with an usb-live, mount the hard-drive and check /etc/default/grub, but I cannot run update-grub since it's the usb-live running.\nThere I could see that <mounted_sda1>/etc/default/grub still had GRUB_HIDDEN and GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT.\nHow do I make the grub start prompt pop up, so that I can boot with the older kernel?\n\nA: As inaccurate as this answer may seem, the only way I can get grub to show up is if I spam right-shift and space-bar just before the OS is starting to boot (just after the BIOS splash screen flashes off).\nMy own anecdotal efforts seem to indicate that I have the best luck when I interchange my key presses, as opposed to just spamming the 2 keys at the same time.\nHaving said that, I've successfully had grub show up by just holding the shift key, and just spamming the space-bar - it seems a bit temperamental, and it sometimes takes me a few reboots just to get it.\n", "Q: Why can terminal uninstall itself? \nHow does apt-get remove xterm go through? And after it's been uninstalled, xterm doesn't close and continues to function normally.\nIs the xterm process cached in RAM whilst it is running?\n\nA: \nIs the xterm process cached in RAM whilst it is running?\n\nExactly. It's similar to the process that allows you to install updates to things while they're running without them crashing. And also why you have to restart services after you update them. Once something is running, its binary is in memory.\nIf it depends on other files (that aren't in a held \"open\" state) that are removed or replaced, that might cause issues but for something as discrete as xterm, that isn't an issue.\n\nA: Not quite.  The file is already open by the program.  Deleting the file ( and then replacing it with another version ) does not affect the running program because the original file is held open ( though without a name on disk to open it again ) until the program is done with it.  Only when all handles to the file are closed are its data blocks on disk released.  Until then the open file can be read and written just like normal -- the only change is that nobody else can open it since its name has been removed.\nWhile parts of the program may have already been read into ram when it is deleted, they may still be discarded and re-read later, or new parts of the program that had not previously been executed can still be loaded from the deleted file.\n\nA: It is in fact a feature of how computers work: When a program is invoked it is indeed loaded into the memory and it works from there.\nA file actually works in the same way. To avoid problems many files in UNIX-ish systems create locks.\nThe actual riddle is why you can't do such and similar things in Windows.\nThis feature is actually what allows you to update the whole system, including the programs that are active in your system. ;)\n", "Q: Linux use binary or decimal prefix? How does Linux deal with Units?

Where prefixes do appear in documentation, they appear without the silly i (k, M, etc., instead of ki, Mi) (see man 5 proc, for example). Since GNU tools didn't gain SI prefix support until well after Linux was released, and Linus doesn't look like someone who changes kernel code simply because a standards organization prefers different prefixes, I speculate that Linux, when it does use these prefixes, uses binary prefixes.\n\nThe manpages developed as part of the kernel documentation, however, does discuss this. See man 7 units:\nThus, today, MB = 1000000B and MiB = 1048576B.\n\nIn the free software world programs are slowly being changed to con‐\nform.  When the Linux kernel boots and says\n\n      hda: 120064896 sectors (61473 MB) w/2048KiB Cache\n\nthe MB are megabytes and the KiB are kibibytes.\n\nWikipedia references this, and mailing list posts by ESR (aka Eric S. Raymond, a well-known kernel developer)  ([1], [2], [3], [4]) show that a patch changing kB to KiB, etc. in one part of the documentation, was accepted, but part of it continued to use the older variants. Thus, prefixes are binary (or are intended to be binary).\n", "Q: LibreOffice is really slow refreshing the UI I am using Ubuntu 14.04LTS and I haven't really had much luck using LibreOffice.  I am currently using LibreOffice v4.2.8.2 build ID: 420m0(build:2).  I attempted to switch to Open Office and this hasn't fixed the problem either.  I posted a video to youtube showing how slow LibreOffice is on a typical refresh:\nhttps://youtu.be/_YnVnpvrWEA\nI am running an Intel Q6600 with 8GB of ram, with an ATi R7 260x video card.  I also have 3 monitors attached to this card.  I am using the Catalyst driver instead of the Radeon driver.  I've tried disabling \"Use hardware acceleration\" to see if that might help, though to no avail.\nI've stopped almost all user processes and this doesn't seem to help.  Top indicates a load average of 0.26, 0.50, 0.69.  When I minimize the window and restore it, I temporarily see the xfdesktop process jump to ~25% but drops quickly, however, kworker and migration processes goes to ~30% during the entire time that it takes to refresh the UI, and on completion go down to nothing.\n\nA: BINGO! I think I just found a clue on this issue --\nThis should be reported to the LibreOffice developers and I'll try to figure out how to do that as well:\nI noticed that if I logged-out of my account then re-logged back in, the problem would immediately go away (ie, menus operating normally). I was shocked to see this, as I've never seen it work correctly before on this computer. I also noticed that upon rebooting/auto-login of my account, if I IMMEDIATELY launched LibreOffice, it would also seem to operate normal. But eventually it would become slow (ie, after closing LibreOffice and then later re-opening it on a new document).\nThis seems to indicate that maybe another background process is interfering somehow, or perhaps the LibreOffice components are not starting up in the correct sequence??\nA workaround I've found that seems to be working consistently is to just turn on the quickstarter feature. That causes the components to load immediately upon login and perhaps they get priority over whatever else may be interfering.\nTool-> Options-> LibreOffice-> Memory-> [X] Enable systray Quickstarter\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to install nvidia driver without replace x.org.x server I am installing nvidia version 340. My ubuntu version 14.04 with kernel is 3.19.0-20-generic. My nvidia is GeForce GT 650M. I install that nvidia version because I have schedule to install CUDA 6.5 and that cuda only work for that nvidia version.I have one problem that is after installing nvidia and restart. After login. I cannot go to main GUI( It appears black screen). However, when I uninstall it. It can go to my GUI.I think that the install replace X.org X. Thus, it cannot go to GUI.

The suggested solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the xorg-edgers/ppa version of the driver (see Pilot6's answer).  That didn't help in my case with the 304 version of the driver (the version was the same as in the standard ppa), your case may differ.\n\n*Install the nouveau driver.  Well, that's the default, so it should be used when there is no Nvidia stuff around.  After trying the Nvidia packages and giving up, uninstall them with \nsudo apt-get purge nvidia...\nUse repeatedly on each package, since the wildcard * may produce unwanted results.  Not for you if you really need the\nNvidia driver. Not for people whose machine drastically overheats\nwith nouveau.\n\n*Try \"nomodeset\" on the linux line in the grub boot items.  May work for some issues.  If that solves some problems, you may make it permanent by adding the word to the file /etc/default/grub on line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset quiet splash\"\n\n*Get rid of unity/compiz.  This may be necessary in some machines\nwhich could only marginally run unity in the past.  There are many other desktop choices.  Easiest way is just to install Lubuntu, then add the Nvidia drivers. If you add the xfce4 package,  \nsudo apt-get install xfce4\nYou should be able to choose the xfce desktop at login by clicking on the little Ubuntu logo at the top of the username list.  Remove unwanted desktops with the\nsudo apt-get purge xfce4\n 5. And the most drastic solution, drop back to a release which works\n    with Nvidia, like the 12.04 with the original 3.2 kernel.  Download the original 12.04 iso, not the later ones like 12.04.5 which are using the later kernels.  Do the usual create install media, and install it (backing up first of course).\nThe easiest solutions are just trying another release, like Lubuntu or Ubuntu 12.04.  The forums are a better place for back and forth help which will probably be needed here, since there seems to be no one clean solution.\n", "Q: Cron jobs not running while OS is locked I have a cron job that runs a simple bash script to swap out the current wallpaper with a random image from my wallpapers folder every minute.

But not sure if there is some limitations on the RAM size, how many RAM cards I could buy and insert into the laptop, and other aspects that I should be aware of. So I appreciate your reply!\n\nA: You can put in as much RAM as your laptop will hold.  64 bit systems have no practical limitations on RAM size.  As said above, an SSD will help with your swap speed.  Your laptop claims to be able to hold a max of 8gb of RAM.  This is likely a limitation of the motherboard, although you can try two 8gb sticks, but no guarantees on that.\nIn short, it looks like you've maxed out your ram.

I am new to Ubuntu and am using a remote server with Ubuntu 14.04 installed on it (headless).  I use putty (on a Windows laptop) to connect to it - ssh with private and public keys. I have also set up ssh tunnelling for socks (dynamic, port xxxx). Saved the session as EmmaWatson. Done.\nFired up the browsers (both Chrome and Firefox) on my Windows laptop, installed the SwitchySwarp extension in Chrome and the FoxyProxy add-on in Firefox. I filled in the details (socks5, localhost - port xxx), enabled the proxy. \nEverything worked fine: for a week I was happily using my proxy to surf the Internet, but all this changed yesterday. Now, for whatever reason, every time I enable the proxy - web pages load fine initially, then the connection hangs, pages stop loading and at the same time the Putty Session (EmmaWatson) also freezes/hangs!! \nWhen I disable the proxy, it unfreezes and putty terminal becomes responsive again. \nI assumed Putty was acting up. So I installed Connectbot on Android, forwarded the port (tunnel), fired up the Firefox browser on Android, made changes to about:config, and it worked! But, it too froze soon after (mere minutes). The terminal (connectbot) became unresponsive and I had to close it.\nNext, I came back to Putty. This time I created another Putty session 'Hermoine' without the tunnel settings. Loaded the first session (EmmaWatson) - enabled proxy in browser and let it freeze. Then I loaded the second session (Hermoine) and it was snappy!

This article talks about how OS's accumulate all sorts of unnecessary things in the RAM due to continued use. Is this the case with Ubuntu too? \nJust curious as my computer has been getting a bit sluggish after a week of not turning off. \n\nA: You probably don't need to restart to clear the ram and swap, as you can clear both without restarting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clearing Swap: You can turn swap off and on again to clear it (make you have enough spare memory using free -m, top or similar) using sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a. If stuff is moved to swap when you have enough free memory, and you don't want it to be, you need to configure swappiness.\n\n*Clearing Cache: Can be done by the method suggested here: free && sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && free. Needs to be done as root, so you can run sudo -i beforehand to drop into a root shell, or try enclosing it in sudo sh -c \" \"\n\n*Clearing programs from RAM: By closing open apps you don't need, and killing extra processes (CAREFULLY) in htop by selecting each process and pressing k+Enter (the tree view in htop is very useful here, press t to use it, then you can determine parent processes etc). Some applications (e.g KDE apps in a GNOME environment) start processes that you may not now need, so you can kill those\nHowever, it may still be necessary to close the machine down every so often due to maintenance, memory leaks, overheating, power cuts etc. You also may need to restart to apply system updates (though you may not need to restart the system for kernel updates with kernel 4+),\n\nA: Some applications, when working for days can \"grow up\" in memory because there might be memory leaks (memory is reserved and not returned when not needed). When you have less memory (because of memory leaks) system moves information from memory to disk (swap partitions) more often, and this is probably the reason of slowing down you experience.\n\nA: You can also open a terminal and do the following\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install bleachbit\nsudo bleachbit\n\nIt will open a program that removes a lot of clutter, old kernels and it will give you a performance boost.

Please reboot the computer, and use this software in an EFI session. This will activate the function. For example, use a live-USB of Boot-Repair-Disk-64bit, after making sure your BIOS is set up to boot USB in EFI mode.\"\nThe problem is that I have found no way to boot ubuntu in \"UEFI mode\", either from USB or from the HDD (it seems that Toshiba laptops can't load USB in UEFI mode)\nOther details are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security mode is disabled\n\n*Fast boot is disabled as well\n\n*All the details of the output of boot-repair here\nDo you have any hints?\n**************** EDIT *****************\nProblem solved. I can boot both OS in UEFI mode.\nThe problem was that the way I had created the USB was not the correct one.\nI followed the instructions in here, and that solved the problem (I had tried this earlier without GPT partitioning and it didn't work.\n\nA: It's not clear if you've installed Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode or if you're saying you haven't yet installed it but that you can boot the installer in BIOS mode.\nIf you want to boot the installer, either to install directly or to run Boot Repair, you must find your EFI's built-in boot manager. In most cases, this can be accessed by hitting a function key early in the boot process, but which one is completely non-standardized. (Some computers also use some other key, like Esc.) When it comes up, it will usually have two options for external media, one of which includes the string \"UEFI\" and the other of which does not. Select the \"UEFI\" option to boot in that mode and the other one to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\nIn some cases, you may need to enter the firmware setup utility to disable its \"fast start\" feature (or words to that effect; again there's no standardization) in order for the boot manager to become available.\nAlso, note that only the 64-bit version of Ubuntu has an EFI boot loader. The 32-bit (x86) version lacks an EFI boot loader and so is not bootable in EFI mode unless you add an EFI boot loader of your own -- and installing the 32-bit Ubuntu on a system with a 64-bit EFI adds another layer of trickiness, so I do not recommend going that route.\nSecure Boot should not be an issue, but sometimes it is, so disabling Secure Boot may be worth doing if you try other things and still can't get it to work.\nAs a general rule, you should not perform a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode install of Ubuntu on a computer that already has Windows booting in EFI/UEFI mode. If you've already installed in this way, you pretty much must get the Ubuntu installer booted again in EFI mode, either to run Boot Repair or to re-install Ubuntu. The other option is to install an EFI boot loader in some other way. For instance, you could use the USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager to boot Ubuntu in EFI mode, then either switch from the BIOS-mode GRUB (grub-pc) to EFI-mode GRUB (grub-efi) or install rEFInd to the hard disk via the Debian package or PPA.\n\nA: I noticed in October 2014 Toshiba was providing BIOS updates that disabled EFI booting for any other OS other than the preinstalled Microsoft OS (8.1). I have a Toshiba Satellite_S55-A5188. It shipped with BIOS v1.4 and I updated to the latest (at the time) to V1.7. With these two versions I could only dual-boot with the CMS (GRUB2) BIOS setting. When Toshiba posted BIOS v1.90 I applied this update. This was a major mistake. Embedded within this BIOS was a dynamic variable reset feature. When the Linux install applied the EFI SHIM path required for a secure boot, the BIOS noticed the change and rewrote the default Microsoft path over the Linux setting. This means my Toshiba will never run any OS other than a Microsoft signed EFI based OS.\nI spent weeks investigating this. On many other Linux sites I found the above to be true for Toshiba laptops in general that were shipped both to Australia  and the EU. All the people on blogs I read or communicated with were design engineers. The Toshiba engineers in these blogs thanked everyone for their input, but Toshiba would not support other OS on its current line of Laptops.\nYour Toshiba Z30-B has many model variations and with a discrete model # for each. Upon checking a few Z30-B's, the BIO versions are totally different for each sub model. Check your Z30-B's Model number on the back label and also your BIOS version. On the Toshiba Support website, enter the full model number and go to the software update list. Select the BIOS check box and a list of all the BIOS versions for that laptop will be listed. If the current BIOS installed on you laptop is old enough you may be able to just dual-boot with the CMS setting. I do not recommend updating your BIOS to any newer version. It may (like in my case) block the use of CMS for dual boot. \n", "Q: mounting remote using sshfs I'm trying to mount a remote server to edit some project i used to do that on windows using winscp.

But, before running Kill command, we must know the PID of the process. For example, here I want to find a PID of ‘cupsd‘ process.\n[avishek@tecmint]# ps ax | grep cupsd\n1511 ?        Ss     0:00 cupsd -C /etc/cups/cupsd.conf\nSo, the PID of ‘cupsd‘ process is ‘1511‘. To kill that PID, run the following command.\n[avishek@tecmint]# kill -9 1511\nTo find out more about kill command with their examples, read the article A Guide to Kill Command to Terminate a Process in Linux\nHow to Disable a Services in Linux\nIn Red Hat based distributions such as Fedora and CentOS, make use of a script called ‘chkconfig‘ to enable and disable the running services in Linux.\nFor example, lets disable the Apache web server at the system startup.\n[avishek@tecmint]# chkconfig httpd off\n[avishek@tecmint]# chkconfig httpd --del\nIn Debian based distributions such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint and other Debian based distributions use a script called update-rc.d.\nFor example, to disable the Apache service at the system startup execute the following command. Here ‘-f’ option stands for force is mandatory.\n[avishek@tecmint]# update-rc.d -f apache2 remove\nAfter making these changes, The system next time will boot without these UN-necessary process which in-fact will be saving our system resource and the server would be more practical, fast, safe and secure.\nThat’s all for now.

I'd check your RAM usage using the system monitor (run it from the Unity dash or with gnome-system-monitor in the terminal). If RAM looks like an issue, you can try trimming down background processes, as Daniel suggested, or just look into a RAM upgrade. You might also look into adjusting your swap partition size and/or your swappiness value.\nThe system monitor may also indicate heavy CPU load, which would be trickier, as CPUs are rarely easy to swap out. Of course, background processes may also lighten CPU load, but I'm not sure what else could make it more efficient.\n", "Q: Having difficulty installing Ubuntu 14.04 on my old Ibm Thinkpad T43 While trying to install ubuntu 14.04 on my old Ibm Thinkpad T43 it can freeze anytime from the Ubuntu logo screen right up to the installing of the file screens.

I can't seem to find any information on how to provide a custom script to be run after installation. Are there examples on this that the community can provide?\n\nA: \nDepending on which installer you are using, MAAS provides different mechanisms to customize an installation. This answer assumes you are using the curtin installer (also known as fast-path installer) which became the default in MAAS 1.7. \n\nMAAS uses cloud-init as part of its installation process. There are multiple ways to customize cloud-init behaviour, the easiest being simply providing a User-Data Script, which cloud-init executes during first boot, after the operating system installation is complete.\nIn MAAS, this can be accomplished by providing the user_data argument to the node start CLI command. The format of that command is:\nmaas <user> node start <node uuid> user_data=<script> distro_series=<name>\n\nwhere <script> is actually a base64-encoded string. For a concrete example, assuming you would like to run a script called addkey.sh which prints some output to the installation console, imports an SSH key from Launchpad for the user ubuntu, and logs the results to a logfile:\n#!/bin/sh\n(\necho ======== Hi World ======================\necho ============== $(date) =================\nssh-import-id user\n) | tee /my.log\n\nyou could issue the following commands:\n$ script=$(base64 addkey.sh)\n$ maas myuser node start node-79b67e82-d25c-11e4-a333-00163eca91de \\\n  user_data=$script distro_series=trusty\n\nwhich if successful should return (after a while) output in the following format:\nSuccess.\nMachine-readable output follows:\n{\n    \"status\": 6, \n    \"macaddress_set\": [\n        {\n...\n\nNow this runs that script after deployment of one specific node. If you'd like to have commands set up so they run on any node which is installed through MAAS,  you can add the commands to be run as part of the late_commands stanza in the /etc/maas/preseeds/curtin_userdata file. For a more complex example which uses this mechanism to set up two VLANs on a network interface, see http://astokes.org/customizing-fastpath-curtin-installations/.\nNote that Curtin is currently mostly undocumented; there is however an overview file that describes some of the detail of its operation.\nKeep in mind this mechanism is not to be confused with a comissioning script, run during the commissioning phase, and which in the MAAS node life-cycle comes before installation. Commissioning is generally used for administrative tasks that are meant to not directly affect installation; examples would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*firmware updating\n\n*sanity testing of key hardware components\n\n*burn-in\n\n\nA: It should be noted that the commands here are for the 1.0 API. In 2.0 and upwards, the command is:\nmaas <profile> machine deploy <system_id> user_data=<base64-encoded-userdata>\n\n", "Q: Nvidia settings not saved after reboot Running ubuntu 15.04.

So once VGA is on the left and HDMI on the right and then the other way around (VGA on the right and HDMI on the left) and save the xorg.conf each time to see the difference. Assuming you have a horizontal configuration of course but it is the same if you have a vertical configuration. You should see a difference in the position parameter (your current says VGA-0:... +0+0, DVI-I-0... +1680+0). This way you can (manually) set the position of the screens. \nIn your case if you wanted to exchange VGA and HDMI you shoudl have something like this DVI-I-0... +0+0, VGA-0:... +xyz+0,) where xyz is the horizontal resolution of your screen on HDMI.\nHopefully this helps!\n", "Q: How to stop automatic freshclam execution I have the latest version of freshclam and clamav installed, and in the past (when I had Ubuntu 14.10) it has only run freshclam automatically a few times a day, but has not been running all the time. Now what I am finding though that if I go to Terminal and execute:\nsudo freshclam\n\nThat I get: \nERROR: /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log is locked by another process\nERROR: Problem with internal logger (UpdateLogFile = /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log).\n\nAnd then the only way to be able to manually run that command is to kill the freshclam process, but this is time wasting, and annoying, so I would like to fully stop freshclam from auto updating, so that I can do manual updates.\nSo what I tried was to install clamtk, and in the Update Assistant settings I tried to set it so that I would manually install updates, and then I clicked Apply, but this seemed, even after a restart, to have no impact on how freshclam behaved.\nSo really my question is, how can I get it so that freshclam does not automatically check for updates, or at least for it to do it a few times a day, but not always be there so that I have to kill it to run it? Or is there a way to fix clamtk so that it does it properly (I have got in touch with the developer of clamtk and he is looking into it, but does not know what the issue is)?\n\nOS Information:\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\n\nPackage Information:\nClamTk:\nclamtk:\n  Installed: 5.18-1\n  Candidate: 5.18-1\n  Version table:\n *** 5.18-1 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     5.15-1 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid/universe amd64 Packages\n\nClamAV:\nclamav:\n  Installed: 0.98.7+dfsg-0ubuntu0.15.04.1\n  Candidate: 0.98.7+dfsg-0ubuntu0.15.04.1\n  Version table:\n *** 0.98.7+dfsg-0ubuntu0.15.04.1 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid-security/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     0.98.6+dfsg-1ubuntu2 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid/main amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: I know this already has an accepted answer, but in my case it didn't help:\nany dpkg-reconfigure setting freshclam to manual updates would result in a running daemon after rebooting, no matter what.  \nwhat did the trick for me was disabling it from init.d completely, with this line:\n sudo update-rc.d clamav-freshclam disable\n\nhope this will be of help to anyone running in my same issues\n\nA: Related to https://askubuntu.com/a/1204422/231142\n\nThat is the freshclam daemon running that is causing that error message.  If you check the log, tail -10 /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log you will probably see updates for the freshclam as early as today.  As long as you're seeing updates, everything is working fine.  I actually don't recommend disabling it as you might forget to update later on.\nIf you want to change the intervals to the freshclam daemon, type in the following from a terminal window:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure clamav-freshclam\n\nthen step through the setup.  In the setup, it asks how many times a day for it to update.  It defaults to 24 (once per hour).

I know, questions like this have been asked before, but I'd like to get some up to date experiences.. From what I've read in various discussions, BTRFS seems like it's relatively stable, but once in a lifetime, with some kind of an upgrade it breaks (don't know how old this info is...). I'm sure, many of you are using BTRFS right now and I'd like to switch to it too, I'd just like to know if YOU consider it stable, had any problems with it, and, well, would you trust it to handle your.... let's say semester project?\n\nA: On the BTRFS Wiki you can find companies that are using it in production or testing it in production so out of the development/testing/staging stages.\nSo you can use it for your semester project as long as you don't forget to make back-ups!\n(But you are making back-ups already, aren't you?)\n\nA: I'm using it on a pretty small SSD. In general it works quite well and I'll keep it, but wouldn't recommend it to an inexperienced user. However, maybe due to the limited space, I have the impression that it slows my system down a bit (compared to ext4).\nBut the main downside is the need for balancing, which must be done regularly if you don't want to end up with a broken system (that you can recover, but still...). While the balancing is running, the computer is noticeably slower.\nGreatest advantage (in particular when e.g. writing a thesis as I currently do) are the snapshot capabilities. I use snapper for hourly backups, such that I can recover from recent mistakes of my own. Of course that doesn't replace external backups. \nTo summarize, if you like trying out new stuff and aren't afraid of small difficulties, you should try it. Do backups, of course, although l haven't experienced any data loss in the last few months since I started using it. \nEdit: This is the blog post l followed to recover my system after I had forgotten to balance it often enough. \nEdit 2: Snapper is a tool from SuSE to manage BTRFS snapshots. The version from the Ubuntu repository has no GUI, but the command line interface is sufficient. \nEdit 3: answering the comment to another answer: I started using BTRFS while 15.04 was beta, hence there has been a lot of kernel updates. I haven't noticed any problems with them. \nEdit 4: as pointed out in the comments, the general speed issue probably occurred when the disk got too full. Balancing was always slow, though. \n\nA: I used it on my personal laptop and desktop at work on SSD for the last few years. So far I hadn't experienced any problems or data loss, but then again this is not a server type of workload.\nDisk format is stable enough for me during the period I used it, I hadn't had a kernel upgrade causing any data losses or difficulties.\nThings I like about BTRFS: \n\n\n*\n\n*I have had my skin saved because apt automatically creates a btrfs snapshot before major system upgrades\n\n*I was able to convert an ext4 filesystem to btrfs in place. In production servers, I would have taken a full system backup first, but in local systems I don't have enough space to make full backups. Not making a full backup before major operations is not a good idea, but fortunately all goes well for me, no hitch. Just don't forget to delete the ext snapshot once you're confident of the conversion or your CoW space will keep growing.\n\n*the btrfs command line interface is IMO, one of the best and most intuitive filesystem command line interface. All the advanced features of btrfs seems accessible and the btrfs wiki fills in the details.\n\n\nA: I use btrfs for years now and there are situations in which I can not recommend using it. When losing power or shutting down unctrollably, the risk of irreparable damage is high. When the hard disk is operated in nearly full state, sporadic malfunctions may happen and the displayed free space and the usable space may differ strongly. When juggling with big amounts of snapshots, there are rare situations in which data gets inaccessible. Some mechanisms as the deduplication, filesystem repair and scrubbing are systematcally broken.\nAll that does not appear too good after so many years of development, and I do not have the impression that the situation will improve. btrfs can be used for special purposes, but under no circumstances I would entrust critical data to it.\n", "Q: No audio jack senses I plug in headphones and it's not detected at all same with my speakers.

Try unsetting it and then issuing your title command:\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\necho -en \"\\033]0;New terminal title\\a\"\n\n\nA: When the PS1 sets the title, any attempt to set the title using a command or PROMPT_COMMAND will fail, since the prompt is printed after all of them. For this reason, I prefer to keep a simple prompt while testing titles (PS1=$; unset PROMPT_COMMAND).\n\nA: Using bash, wmctrl, xprop, ps\n1) For a long-running active program:\nFor example, start a program  (ranger) running in a terminal, started from the desktop, change the title, once, after some delay ( 5 seconds ) when the program starts :\nstartranger.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n/usr/local/bin/changetitle.sh 5 ranger\n/usr/local/bin/ranger\n\nchangetitle.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\ndelay=\"$1\"\nshift\nwintitle=\"$*\"\nwinid=`xprop -root | grep _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW | head -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/,//' | sed 's/^0x/0x0/'`\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep $delay; wmctrl -i -r $winid -N \\\"$wintitle\\\"\" &\n\n2) If you are running a terminal session without running an active program, update the title on a loop that ends when your terminal exits:\nchangetitleloop.sh 1 maintenance for server\n\nrunning the above will update the title of the current terminal every 1 second even if you cd (can change it multiple times), using:\nchangetitleloop.sh\n#!/bin/bash\ninterval=\"$1\"\nshift\nwintitle=\"$*\"\ntermpid=\"$(ps -p $$ -o ppid= | sed -e 's/^[ \\t]*//')\"\nwinid=`xprop -root | grep _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW | head -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/,//' | sed 's/^0x/0x0/'`\n/bin/bash -c \"ss=\\$$; echo \\$ss > /tmp/term-$termpid.pid; while x=\\$(wmctrl -i -r $winid -N \\\"$wintitle\\\"); ret=\\$?; sleep $interval; owner=\\$(cat /tmp/term-$termpid.pid); [ \\$ret -eq 0 ] && [ \\$ss -eq \\$owner ]; do continue; done;\" &\n\n\nA: One solution may be to install the latest version of tmux. \ntmux allows setting per-pane titles, enabled by this command:\ntmux set -g pane-border-status top\n\nThey can also be displayed on the bottom.\nTitles are then set via an escape sequence:\nprintf '\\033]2│;%s\\033\\\\' 'My Pane Title'\n\nEach pane can have its own title and all titles show all the time. \nThe tmux panes will then look like this:\n──0 \"My Pane Title\"──────┬──1 \"Another Pane\"───────\n>                        │>\n\nThis was tested on linux mint 18.2 (like Ubuntu) with tmux 2.8. Installation was from a tarball.\nIf you want to be more productive in your terminal, tmux offers lots of other features too.\n", "Q: Help creating Custom Grub2 Entry for Parted Magic 2015 (Have working 2013) I love parted magic, I want to be able to use the newest version.

How it works is the user software calls a particular Polkit API asking to shutdown and Polkit will check if that user has the authority to take that action, and if so facilitate it.  Polkit is also able to ask for authentication via an authentication agent if the user doesn't have the authority to take that action.\nMore information about the architecture of Polkit here:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/polkit.8.html\n\nA: The command used for shutdown uses dbus. Indeed the shutdown command is: \ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.login1 /org/freedesktop/login1 \"org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.PowerOff\" boolean:true\n\nIndeed the systemd-logind service is responsible for user losings.\nIn addition to what  @thomasrutter said, Indeed the systemd-logind provides the PolicyKit-based access for users to operations such as system shutdown or sleep.\nman systemd-logind\nsystemd-logind is a system service that manages user logins.

This is a result of the fact that the shell splits words based on spaces when it parses a command line. Without quotes, each individual part of the argument (such asC:\\Program) is treated as a separate argument by itself. You can use quotes to prevent the word splitting:\nni wine \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Foxit Software\\Foxit Reader\\FoxitReader.exe\"\n\nThis passes two arguments to the ni command: wine and the full Windows path for FoxitReader.\nWhen you tried placing the opening double quote before wine, the shell treated the whole lot of wine C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Foxit Software\\Foxit Reader\\FoxitReader.exe as one argument for the ni command.\nIf you want to avoid similar issues in the future, I’d recommend checking Greg’s wiki for an in-depth explanation on how the shell deals with spaces. You may not understand it all but you should still learn why, when and how to avoid word splitting problems.\n\nA: What Anthony said is true, you can use \"\" to say the whole path is a string, but maybe this is worth a consideration, as with this method yo ucan use  to complete your paths: There are many special characters in a unix terminal, including spaces,*,newlines and other. You can ignore them by typing a \"\\\" before them. So if a folder is named \"My test\", u can either use cd \"My test\", or cd My\\ test, which you can  complete. But in wine you'll probably have to use the Michaelsoft Binbows convention \"\".(no offense, just Microsoft jokes :D )\n\"Protip :D\" Sometimes you may want for some reason write a \"\\\" character. To write it, you have to protect it, so you put another \"\\\" before it.\nSo if you want to write \"Protected character \\\" you actually do echo Protected character \\\\. Note that echo takes string arguments so you don't have to protect the space.\nHope it helps :)\n", "Q: my internal hard disk is not mounting used to mount before.. suddenly stopped Error mounting system-managed device /dev/sda3: Command-line `mount \"/mnt/5CE0040FE003EDD8\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda3': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.

When you set your own PATH, in most cases you will want to append your new entry to the old PATH variable, not replace it entirely, as you have done.\nSet your PATH variable back to the system default by typing\nexport PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n\nand then go edit your .bashrc and .bash_profile to have the correct entry, which will be something like\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin\"\n\nNotice the variable is set to begin with the existing $PATH.  This way, you'll still have all the original system directories in your PATH, and your addition will be on the end.  Also note that I removed lumen from the end of your example, because lumen is apparently the name of the binary you are trying to execute, and your PATH should include only directories containing binaries, not the binaries themselves.\n\nA: Exec this to get your system default:\ngrep _PATH /etc/login.defs \n\n\nA: \nThe command could not be located because '/bin' is not included in the\n  PATH environment variable.\n\nThis error means you overwrite your default path with the added PATH vairable above.\nHow to restore the old PATH?\nThe default PATH variable is defined in /etc/environment.\nTo restore the default PATH first delete the add line export PATH=\"~/.composer/vendor/bin/lumen\" from your .bashrc \nThen save and source using command:\nsource .bashrc \n\nthen delete from .bash_profile then save and source:\nsource .bash_profile\n\nNow source /etc/environment to restore the default path\nsource /etc/environment\n\nNow your default PATH is restored, you can check by running echo $PATH\nAdding new path to PATH variable\nNow to add a new PATH use:\nexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin/\n\nEDIT: The error here raises because we add the binary itself so check the above line\nAdd the line to .bashrc then save and source:\nsource .bashrc\n\nCheck running $PATH you should see your new added path.\n\nA: the PATH stores all the places where the terminal looks for your applications/scripts etc... If you set the PATH to some \"unfriendly\" directory, the system will not be able to find /bin/sudo and others. You will have to type the whole path like /bin/sudo. The best way to fix this is to open your bash_profile and insert this line: export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games I think changing the profile will work just after the next reboot, so do this and after that use the command export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games to fix it for the current session.\n\"Protip :D :D\"\nif you want to check for your own programs in a directory \"/home/username/foo/bin\", just add this way to your PATH and you will be able to call the programs stored there just by their names\nHope it helps :)\n", "Q: How to to fetch kernel errors in Ubuntu..? I a trying to make an alert e-mail system using Perl Script, when a kernel error occurs in a server. How can I fetch serious error logs from the kernel? \nLogs can be seen in /var/log/kern.log\nThe requirement is to detect it, when a log is being written with a serious error message in kern.log.  How to sense such an error? Or is there any other possible better method? Kindly help it.\n\nA: Answered in comments by Muru:\n\nThe logs are processed using a program called rsyslog, which sends it to appropriate files like kern.log, auth.log, syslog, etc. You can modify it's configuration to send mails as well. The logged messages are classified into priority levels, so you can do so only for certain priorities, and only for messages from certain sources (the kernel, but not others). I'll write a more compete answer if I get the time, but this should be enough of a starting point for you or someone else to figure out what needs to be done.\n\n\nA: Use kerneloops ?\nkerneloops is a daemon used to submit kernel oops to kerneloops.org automatically.\nYou can change the submit-url line in /etc/kerneloops.conf to your liking. However, you will need some server to be able to catch the file sent by kerneloops daemon.\nAnd somehow parse the file send by kerneloops too. I don't know the format of the file.

If you didn't, try making one by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Windows 8 (you will make the partition here).\n\n*Search and open Disk Management.\n\n*Here you should see your Hard Drive, right-click it and select Shrink a Basic Volume.

Now you can reboot your PC and try the installer again.\n\n\nA: When you say inside Windows 8, you mean a dual-boot option, right? If, you need to partition your hard drive in the \"disk management\" and do a formatted partition dedicated for Ubuntu. The allocated space depends on what you're going to do - but 10-15gb minimum I'd say.

I want to merge videos in batch size of twenty (20) each. I'm running a Linux machine. The videos are in mp4 format and moderate quality. Some even have the audio stream missing. So far I've tried ffmpeg, mencoder, cvlc/vlc and MP4Box. I want to write a command line script to achieve this, since I'm doing batch processing.\nThe main issue is that some of the solutions I tried work well for two videos, some work well for videos with audio stream and yet others work well for some other subset of my video set.

No PXE either, of course.\nThe hard drive contains a single partition (such as ext4), with a working Ubuntu installation. Somehow, I have managed to download a recent ISO LiveCD image to this hard drive (such as 14.04.2). I would now like to install the LiveCD system to the hard drive, replacing the existing system.\nNote: this is not a real situation, just something I have thought up to torture myself. And others. ;-)\nWhat I have so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first step was to configure GRUB2 to boot from the ISO image. This works, following instructions given in this link: http://www.howtogeek.com/196933/how-to-boot-linux-iso-images-directly-from-your-hard-drive/\n\n*Once in the live session, I run ubiquity (the Ubuntu installer). In manual hard drive selection, I specifiy using the hard drive's unique partition, but not to format it. I have previously removed the former operating system, deleting directories /bin, /lib, /usr, etc. (but retained /boot and the place where I have the ISO image file).\n\n*Ubiquity complains it needs to unmount partitions on /dev/sda, even though I have specified no changes are to be made to the existing partition.\n\n*I have also tried to boot the Ubuntu LiveCD ISO image file completely to RAM (kernel parameter: toram). This works with >= 4 GBytes RAM. Once inside the LiveCD, I manually unmount /dev/sda1. The unmount works, and the LiveCD continues working correctly; i.e. I can run applications from the menu. But the installer still blocks, this time complaining it cannot access the LiveCD. This also happens just after the partitioning stage of the install process.\n\n\nI have read the responses to a similar question here Can I install Ubuntu on the same hard drive I booted with? but the answers do not seem to be applicable to my case (they set out from a less complex initial situation.)\nAny ideas on how to proceed from here?\n\nA: Boot to RAM, unmount partitions, use gparted to create a small partition 1-2gb, copy iso image there, set up grub to boot iso. boot iso. install. Hope this will work\n", "Q: Partitioning advice with SSD/HDD combination I'm building a PC with a 128GB SSD and a 4TB HDD. I want to move my media collection from smaller external HDDs (NTFS) back into my PC (ext4). There's two formatting options and I tend to prefer the second one. There's no dual boot with Windows so I won't need to access my media collection from Windows.\nI could have my swap and root on the SSD and /home on the HDD. Root will take up all the space on the SSD after creating swap and /home will take up all the space on the HDD. My media stuff will be inside /home.\nI was thinking that I might instead have /home on the SSD as well and use the HDD purely as a dump for my media collection. Large downloads will go to the HDD. This way the media collection will not be inside /home. This is pretty much like I use my external HDDs now.\nAny recommendations?\n\nA: I keep my /home on the SSD, but some directories under my user(s) are symbolic linked to /data disk. Like ~/Downloads, ~/Dropbox, ~/VirtualBox VM's, etc...\nBecause then all the cache directories of the user can be accessed quickly, and the 'data'-directories can't fill up the root suddenly. For example when you create a VM in Virtual box with 64GB disk for a test, suddenly the disk might be full.\nDue to reinstalling my os every 6 months (to have a clean system and to learn), I started writing some basic bash scripts, that in the end, I just run command by command anyway, but it gives me a lead and I put reminders.

I say \"because of missing\" swap partition, but I am not sure about that. That's my hypothesis at the moment. Read on to understand the full context.\nI am attempting to install Ubuntu but it appears to get stuck in some sort of loop during the initial configuration where there are all those splash screens that show you all the things you can do with Ubuntu (like \"take your music with you\", \"have fun with your photos\", etc.). I would be glad just to install it!...\nArchitecture: AMD64 (a.k.a. \"Intel\" x86-64)\nUbuntu version: 15.04 for desktop\nISO image: ubuntu-15.04-desktop-amd64\nInstallation media: USB flash drive (Kingston USB 3.0)\nSATA port 0: empty\nSATA port 1: SATA HDD, Seagate 500G\nSATA port 2: SATA HDD, Seagate 500G\nSATA port 3: SATA HDD, WD 4T\nSATA port 4: empty\nSATA port 5: empty\nSATA AHCI: enabled\n\nI am trying to install it on port 2. I have all Windows installations on port 1. I intend to switch between the two disks with F12. The HDD on port 2 has been completely wiped and zero filled before I attempted to install Ubuntu the first time. So there is nothing in there that could mess with its bits and bytes. Also note that the GRUB2 loader was set to install on /sdb which is the same HDD that the system root partition is on. So there should not be a conflict with Windows loader.\nIt gets stuck at exactly this line:\nCreating ext4 file system for / in partition #1 of SCSI5(0,0,0)(sdb)...\n\nBut I can tell that there is more going on in the background if I expand the Terminal peep-hole type of window (it's very tiny and only fits two or three lines) at the bottom of the window.\nn id = 0, likely wrong\nJun 15 23:17:01 ubuntu CRON[25886]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)\n\nI tried tried issuing some commands just to see if I can take back control because it was taking way too long to complete this simple task. It got stuck at some point I could no longer type in anything, so I gave it the three finger salute and it didn't react, and lastly I pushed the button to reset.\n\nThis is not the first time I am installing Ubuntu on this computer. But it is the first time I am trying to install it on a single partition. I decided to skip the swap partition this time around. Is this what is causing it to hang up like this? Is it in fact mandatory for a Ubuntu Linux system to have a swap partition? I know it shouts at me when I decide to proceed with the installation without defining a swap partition.\nI am not sure if it really gets stuck in a loop. Mainly because I don't have time to baby sit it and observe and absorb the command lines as it ticks. But I tried to install it today and it appears as if the command lines, as seen in the Terminal peep-hole are different. If I let it choke on it for a few hours and then come back to it, I see that the last line has changed... as though it is installing but at a pace of a snail! Well here it is...\nJun 16 09:26:10 ubuntu systemd[1]: Started Cleanup of Temporary Directories.\nJun 16 10:17:01 ubuntu CRON[20388]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)\n\nSame configuration, same setup! The partition I am trying to install to is the first partition on the HDD, and it is set to primary, and the mount point is system root. Again, no swap partition.\nHow can I get more information about what is going on with the installation? Are there any persistent logs being saved anywhere? Can I enforce logging before I start the installation?\nWhat is the problem with it? Is it because I decided to skip the swap partition? I will try removing all the other HDDs and only leave the one I want to install on. I will also test if it helps to add that swap partition. But before I do any of that, I thought I would post a question here and see if there is something else I can do to get past this problem, and/or if this is a common problem with Ubuntu Linux installations.\nUpdate 1\n\nI just checked on it and it has moved one line down! Wheee! With a speed of one line per hour I may just be done with this by the time I take vacation. Here is a screenshot update.\n\nUpdate 2\n\nIt had already been ticking for several hours, so I gave it a three finger salute shortly after I posted update 1 here. It did not recognize the salute, so I had to force an unexpected reboot (reset!).\nI disconnected all HDDs except the patient on port 2. Booted up using the USB flash drive, selected install, and this is what my partition table looked like.\n\nSpace used: unknown?... wtf? I see this often. Does this have an actual meaning? Or is it just meaning-less?... as a way of telling me that the partition has not been used yet? See, I do not get this at all. I would actually much more prefer to see a blank white-space than this.\nSo I removed that partition and created a new partition of the same size and type.\n\n\nI started the installation and I left the building.\n\nSeveral hours later...\n\nI came back and the installation process had not seen much progress. It was still chocking on it.\n\nA: Hypothesis confirmed! Care to challenge it?... Be my guest and post your findings as a new answer. I will be happy to test your findings.\nAdd a swap partition and the problem is gone! The presence of or the lack of a swap partition should not halt or cripple the installation process in any way, of course! But then again, here I am... installing Ubuntu with the swap partition makes it happy, but installing Ubuntu without a swap partition makes it cranky. How do you explain that?\n\nMaybe I should have offered it a banana?... do vervet monkeys even like bananas?\n\nI had all the other HDDs disconnected. So only the patient HDD was connected and the USB flash drive, of course. Here is the whole story in screenshots...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, I installed GRUB2 on the same HDD, and device node was /sda as there was only one HDD attached this time. But I noticed the reported size of the primary partition was 40960M this time. Before, without the swap partition in front of it, the size was 40959M. So that's off by 1 MB! Could this be the cause of the problem? Partition misalignment, rather than presence or the lack of a swap partition per se? I punched in the same partition size in the dialog box each time. I used 12288M for swap, which is 50% more than the physical RAM.\n\nA: The swap partition has nothing to do with this. If u didn't create a swap partition it should just warn you that it is recommended to create one & that's all ( i have tried that).\nWhen u selected the HDD u want to install Linux on, did u select the ext4 partition, the disk as primary & to allocate the space at the beginning of the disk ?\nTry using a different iso image or even a different distribution like Linux mint( i highly recommend this one) or fedora..\nIf that's not the cause i think it's a boot loader conflict between Linux & Windows( i have experienced that a lot).

It happened to me too yesterday as soon as I saw the update was available. At this point you cannot just reset your phone, what you need is to re-install ubuntu-touch (at least that's what it sounds like from your description). I cannot speak from experience because I don't have the time to bring mine back to life, but here are all the instructions on how to do this:\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/en/start/ubuntu-for-devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices/\n", "Q: Clone single partition to empty disk I would like to clone a single partition off of my current HDD to a newer, larger SSHD. The partition that I would like to clone is running Linux Mint 17.1. Using a bootable Clonezilla USB, I have been able to clone the entire old disk to a new disk, but the Mint partition is preceded by a large, messy Windows 8.1 partition. The Windows 8.1 partition is failing on the HDD, however, so I only want to keep the Mint partition.\nCould I do this with Clonezilla, GParted, dd, or some combination?\n\nA: You will need to have both partitions mounted, for instance on /old and /new. Then use the rsync utility:\nrsync -aruv /old/* /new/\n\nIf the old partition is your root system, you will want not to copy over the contents of some directories. Just exclude them, such as:\nrsync -aruv /* /new/ --exclude=/dev/* --exclude=/proc/* --exclude=/run/* --exclude=/sys/* --exclude=/tmp/* --exclude=/new\n\nDo not forget that last one! (Been there, done that. ;-) ).\nHTH\n\nA: Don't know what an sshd is (related to storage) ... did you mean SSD?\nThere are 50+ different ways to do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*dd\n\n*ddrescue\n\n*partimage\n\n*clonezilla\n\n*fsarchiver\n\n*gparted\n\n*rsync\n\n*any normal backup/recovery too\n\n\nSo the best answer for you will depend on your skillz with any of the above commands AND how good you are in correcting the /etc/fstab after the restore to a new disk is completed. If you know fstab, grub-install, update-grub and blkid well, any of these tools are trivial.\nAnyway, the man pages for any of those tools explains how to use them. Also, don't forget to create the partitions on the target disk for swap too. It would be smart to use GPT (not MBR) formating if your situation allows that. If there isn't any Windows involved on the new system, go for it - use GPT and be happy. Windows only allows GPT if UEFI boot AND a 64-bit OS.\nOf course, we are having to make hundreds of assumptions about your setup here - if you use LVM, encryption, or anything strange like booting off xfs or zfs partitions, then all bets are off.\nTo get more exact suggestions, post the output from sudo parted -l please. Have both disks connected when running it.\nThe general steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot off a liveCD (disto or Rescue Disk)\n\n*Create the partition table on the new disk (GPT recommended)\n\n*Create the desired partitions on the disk \n\n*\n*\n\n*/boot\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*/\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*/home\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*others .... /var /opt, ....\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*swap\n\n\n*Size each as desired, but be smart.  Also, it is smart to leave some leftover space that can be added later to partitions that need it.\n\n*use the listed tools to copy over the data ... I'd probably use ddrescue.  sudo ddrescue source target   Use the partition device for both sides.  Something like /dev/sda20  /dev/sdb34 (those are NOT correct for your situation)\n\n*mount the new disk to a temp location - /mnt is good\n\n*edit the /mnt/etc/fstab to point partitions to the correct place using either the path to the partition or a LABEL or a UUID\n\n*install grub onto the new disk - lots of howtos for that (should include a chroot cmd and may include multiple mount commands)\n\n*reboot - disconnect the liveCD before the 2nd boot happens\nBe happy.\n\n\nAgain, if you want better help with more details, post the output from the requested cmd.\nBTW - you can safely delete the Windows partitions, assuming the old disk will be left in the computer. That isn't clear.\n\nA: For example you want to clone /dev/sda1 ext (linux) partition to /dev/sdb disk.\nFirst Install gparted and gddrescue.\nThen use gparted to create /dev/sdb1 partition with the same size as /dev/sda1 or larger.\nThen use the following commands in terminal to clone partition and expand filesystem:\nsudo ddrescue -B -v -d -n --force /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 ~/ddrescue_clone_sda1-sdb1.log\nsudo ddrescue -B -v -d -r 2 --force /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 ~/ddrescue_clone_sda1-sdb1.log\nsudo e2fsck -f -y -v -C 0 /dev/sdb1\nsudo resize2fs -p /dev/sdb1\n\nCommands explanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone partition without retrying to read bad blocks\n\n*If there was errors of reading (bad blocks) with first command (see log file), this one will try to read them 2 times more.\n\n*Check filesystem on the cloned partition.\n\n*Enlarge the filesystem to partition size.\n\n\nAnd don't forget, if you cloning boot partition you need to set boot flag after cloning. And install grub.\nYou can set the boot flag for /dev/sdb1 in gparted.\nTo install grub on new /dev/sdb disk run these commands:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdb\nsudo umount /mnt\n\n", "Q: File Permissions and umask I am new to linux in general and have figured out the different programs belong to different groups.

The project uses old version of the library (libSDL-1.2). I've made mistake of installing the newest library but have since removed it. However, I can still find traces of it in multiple Ubuntu library directories.\n\nIn some directories there is proper version (/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/) while in others there is the newest, wrong, version (/usr/local/lib/). Why do I have this inconsistencies and how do I completely remove libSDL2?\n\nA: /usr/local/ contains files that are not installed by the package manager, be it due to a manual installation or additional files downloaded by e.g. an installer script from a package (although those mostly go to /opt/).\nAPT is therefore unaware of the files below that directory. If you installed the libraries manually, e.g. by extracting an archive there, you should also be able to remove them in the same way.\nPay, however, attention if you didn't install them manually. In this case please tell us how you installed them to receive further and better help.\nAnother possibility is that the libraries could be there because they may have been downloaded by something else, and not from installing libsdl2 using APT. E.g. Valve's Source Engine uses SDL2. When you install a Source-based game, e.g. Half Life or Portal, Steam will download its own libraries (although it keeps them in the users home directory). The may come from something similar. If you have no idea where they come from, leave them be. They will not disturb your development, if done correctly (see below) and deletion may break some other application.\nIf you want to continue using SDL1.2, you sould be able to do so without removing the other libs: Tell the compiler/linker to use the older libraries. SDL2 shared libraries are always called libsdl2-....so, so simply link against the correct libraries without the sdl2 in there.\n", "Q: How to disable input language switching in terminal In Ubuntu 12.04 I have two input languages installed, English and Russian.

Save it as a text file, run sudo chmod +x scriptname.sh , and it is ready to perform.\nThis script requires installation of wmctrl program, which is key to the script's functionality. To install it, run sudo apt-get install wmctrl.\nTo make it run continuously on every login, add the full path to the script to Startup Applications or create custom .desktop file in /home/yourusername/.config/autostart . A variation on the theme of using .desktop files is Takkat's answer.\nThis script can be adapted in a number of ways. Knowing WM_CLASS of your desired program (from output wmctrl -lx ), you can substitute gnome-terminal.Gnome-terminal for any other program class in the if [ \"$WM_CLASS\" == \"string\" ];then line. You can also set which language to force, by knowing the indexes of your languages (just count them top to botom in the drop down menu, starting at 0 with the top one) and altering gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources current 0. Among other things, if you add multiple else if statements, there's possibility to force different languages in different programs. The script is simple and very flexible. \nExplanation in Russian\nСкрипт выше следит за окнами которые активны , и если окно относится к классу gnome-terminal.Gnome-terminal , язык моментально меняется на английский. \nДля того что бы этот скрипт работал требуется установка программы wmctrl - это самая важная часть, которую можно установить с командой sudo apt-get isntall wmctrl.\nДля того что бы этот скрипт работал автоматически, сохраните в каком-то файле (на пример с именем myscript.sh), поменяйте разрешения этого файла с командой sudo chmod +x /full/path/to/myscript.sh (где /full/path/to/myscript.sh  это полный аддресс где находится файл), и добавьте полный аддресс к этому скрипту как одна из Startup Applications. Или же можно создать .desktop файл.\nЭтот скрипт можно адаптировать под другие программы. Просто узнайте какой класс у той программы при промощи команды  wmctrl -lx  - это третий столбик в результате. Если есть желание, можно добавить другие программы с прибавлением конструкции else if\nSources:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/414041/295286\n\nA: The only way I know is to use gxneur.\nIt is buggy in Ubuntu for automatic switching layout, but is good for these kind of settings. Automatic switching can be easily disabled.\nYou can set there applications, like gnome-terminal, to have single layout.\nYou can read THIS TOPIC in Russian by gxneur maintainer.\nBut I also will be happy if there is a better way.\n\nA: All of a sudden I found a very simple solution, that does not need any scripting.\nYou can click language indicator, select \"Text Entry Settings...\".\nIn the opened window check \"Allow different sources for each window\" and\n\"New window use the default source\".\n\nIf default layout is English, each newly opened application will be started with English layout, including terminal.\n", "Q: Why does the installer make an extended partition for swap by default? Every time I've done a clean default install of Ubuntu or a variant on an MBR type system, I end up with a system partition and a swap partition.  The installer always tucks the swap partition inside an extended partition.\nWhy?  It seems more straightforward to create two simple partitions.  But I am guessing that there is a good reason and I am showing my ignorance here.\n\nA: Primary partition is only needed when you want to make it bootable. If you look up wikipedia there's a \"full story\" about that. Extended and logical partitions have some cons. But if you want a primary swap partition, you can partition it by yourself, it's not hard and you seem like you understand what are you talking about, so it shouldn't be a problem for you. There's a manual partitioning in most installers, or you can use GParted, fdisk, disked and others.\nHope this helps :)\n\nA: There are many ways to create partitions for Ubuntu installations.\nDefault is primary /, and swap in a logical one.\nIt does not matter for linux which type of partition to boot from (logical or primary).\nThe reason why this layout has been chosen must be that it is not always possible to create 2 primary partitions, when system is installed in parallel with some other OS, like Windows.\nThere is a limit in MBR of 4 primary partitions.\nI would choose in this case to create an extended and two logical for / and swap instead.\nAnyway this is just a default layout, you can change it as you like. \n", "Q: wget not getting full directory listing I've hunted high and low and have not been able to find an answer to my problem. I'm not sure if this is the proper forum, but I hope someone here might be able to help.\nI have been using wget (FTP) to backup my website to my local HD, using the mirror option, with no problem, until recently. Recently, a directory that holds images reached the limit, set by the hosting service, for how many items can be in a FTP listing. I do not have SSL access to the account.\nI can run a script, on the remote server, and get a full directory listing (ls), in a file, and download it to my local machine.\nIs it possible to feed this file to wget and have it mirror those files to my local drive, as it did prior to hitting the listing limit? I would like wget to read the generated list and check for changed and added files. Here are the questions I have been unable to find answers to:\n1) What would be the proper ls command to generate the needed information? Currently, I'm only getting the actual filenames, but I'm sure that more is needed.\n2) Will wget with mirror option still work with an input file, or will it just download all files in the input file without checking for changed status? I have found absolutely no information on this combination - only on one or the other. I don't want to test and wind up getting a full backup of the directory - waste of bandwidth and time to pull all that data down.\n\nA: You can do this, the only problem is getting an output from ls that is the\nsame on the remote and on your local machine. My ls has an option\n--time-style=+%s that shows the last modified time of the file in seconds\nsince the epoch, which should match on both machines.  I'm assuming you\nonly want to do this for one directory, otherwise find would be more\nappropriate if you have that command.\nOn the remote do the ls in the required directory into a file:\ncd ... # cd to the directory to list\nls -l --time-style=+%s . >/tmp/listfile\n\nOn the local machine, copy the remote /tmp/listfile to local /tmp/listfile, then use\nawk to suppress the first 4 columns of output and sort the list of file\nsize, date and filename. (I'm assuming you might have filenames with\nspaces hence the bizarre awk).\nawk '{$1=\"\";$2=\"\";$3=\"\";$4=\"\";print}' </tmp/listfile | sort >/tmp/a\n\nIn the mirrored directory get the same listing:\ncd ... # cd to same directory we listed remotely\nls -l --time-style=+%s . | awk '{$1=\"\";$2=\"\";$3=\"\";$4=\"\";print}' | sort >/tmp/b\n\nCompare the two sorted lists and drop the lines that are the same with\ncomm. Drop the size and date columns (and incidentally the tab at the\nstart of lines in /tmp/b not in /tmp/a, and 2 inter-column spaces) and drop\nduplicate filenames with uniq. (You dont need to sort again as the\nduplicate lines are adjacent).\ncomm -3 /tmp/a /tmp/b | awk '{$1=\"\";$2=\"\";print substr($0,3)}' | uniq >/tmp/c\n\nThe list in /tmp/c is all files that are new, of different size or\ntimestamp, or have been removed.

I'm trying to understand what the PPA is and why some people use the command below for their Nvidia drivers to work:\nppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nI haven't found anyone who can clearly explain why you would need this package for an Nvidia driver, what it does, or how it works. All the posts on various forums just tend to say to put the command in without giving any reasons of why. So can someone please do me the honour of explaining it?\n\nA: You can read THIS about \"what PPA is\".\nXorg-edgers ppa contains Nvidia drivers, that are not yet present in Ubuntu repositories. They are correctly packed to install with DKMS.\nIf you need an updated Nvidia driver, the best way is to install it from that ppa.\nBut xorg-edgers ppa also contains other testing packages, that are not always good to install automatically.\nThat's why it is recommended after you install Nvidia drivers to run\n sudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nIt removes that repository from sources.list.d and prevents from installing other updates from there.\n\nA: PPA stands for \"Personal Package Archives\". They are repositories, compiled by users or developers, to provide different versions of packages to those bundled in the main Ubuntu repositories or to provide software not available by default.\nThe reason that some people add the Nvidia PPA is because each Ubuntu release is packaged, by default, with access only to a specific set of versions of the driver and associated proprietary software. However, Nvidia frequently release updates to their drivers. In order to provide easy, seamless access to these newer versions, you can add the PPA and then, as soon as the PPA maintainer adds it, you can install the newer driver with the same ease as any other package.\n\nA: Typically a PPA is a way for you to get an application installed in a way that you know were already tested working on a specific version of Ubuntu.\nDo note when I say specific version of Ubuntu because sometimes installing the previous of future version of a PPA on your version of Ubuntu (eg: Installing packages from a PPA from Ubuntu 23.10 on your 23.04 or installing from 22.10 on your 23.04) can cause issues.\nSpecific PPAs only focus on very specific packages (Not all, but popular ones do) which gives them more stability and trust when it comes with using them for updating a particular application, driver, etc. On top of it, they are maintained and up to date with the latest versions of that particular application.\nMore PPA reasons can be found here:\nAre PPAs safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\nWhat are PPAs and how do I use them?\nNow coming back to the Nvidia PPA question. The correct Nvidia PPA is this one:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nAnd if you have an Nvidia card (Hybrid or Dedicated) then you can use the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\n\nAfter running this, your Ubuntu will auto update itself and depending on your Nvidia model, you can pick from several updated packages for it.\nHere are the ones found up to this day of posting:\n\nWhich can be summarized like this:\n390 Driver - For Cards older than the Nvidia Geforce 8000 Series\n470 Driver - For Cards between the Nvidia Geforce 8000 Series and the GT Series\n5xx Driver - For Cards between the GTX and RTX versions. Including a bunch of Quadro and MX cards for Notebooks. The latest 525.xx was specifically made for the 4090, 4080 and 4070 series.\nSo if you have the latest card, you would do something like this to install it:\nsudo apt install nvidia-graphics-drivers-525\n\nDo also note that you can install it after install the PPA from the software & updates app. Simply open the gnome search with SUPER and type software then open the Software & Updates app. Should look like this:\n\nClick on Additional Drivers and from there you can simply select the version of the driver available for your specific card and install. You will need to reboot afterwards:\n\nIn my case it only shows the 525 Driver because I have a 4090, but if you had an older one, it will show 2 or 3 other driver options (eg: 510, 515, 525 for example).\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 14.04/14.10 on a UEFI laptop with Nvidia GeForce 840M My laptop:\ni7 with built-in Intel HD 4400, 8GB ram, Nvidia GeForce 840M, Broadcom WiFi, Windows 8.1 64 bit.\nI have tried to get Linux to work but ran into a lot of issues such as screen tearing and flickering.

The full title of this question is:\nBash: What to do when control-c won't kill a process, due to the fact that the bash script contains a loop which calls another process: Is there a better solution to the on/off power button?\nThe title of this question is fairly self explanatory, but here's some more detailed information:\nI have a bash script running which calls another program. (Runs / executes another program.)\nThis program is a data/curve fitting program, which cannot be interrupted with CTRL-C. But, from reading this post, I found I can kill it with CTRL-\\\nHypothetical Thoughts...\nSo it is possible to just mash the keyboard, holding CTRL down, and mashing the \\ key, BUT what if you bought a really expensive mechanical keyboard yesterday and don't have enough money to buy another cheap keyboard you're willing to \"mash\" (because you don't want to use up any of those 10^6 key-presses you have before your shiny new mechanical keyboard will wear out), or alternatively don't have enough time to find your old keyboard in your house because your house is either extremely disordered (a mess) or because there is an emergency such as a chip-pan fire occurring simultaneously...\nAlso consider that a loop is calling this fitting program and perhaps you're fitting 1000 data files, pressing the \\ key 1000 times is likely to take a long time.\nHyperspace Thoughts...\nOr even; what if you made a mistake in the bash script and it's actually executing an infinite loop?\nWhat can you do to stop the parent script running in this situation? You could unplug your computer, hold the power button down for 10 seconds to turn it off, or throw it into the chip-pan fire to stop it working, but these solutions seem insensible due to the possible loss of data which may occur.\nIn theory, one could run the system monitor and perhaps quit the bash process, but this may be difficult to find if you have many such processes all with the same name... In addition, you might have a single core computer, or a multicore computer with say N cores, running N processes which are all trying to use 100 % CPU. Or perhaps just 1 process is using more than the 4 GB of ram you have and so your computer is extremely slow for that reason... Too slow at least to run the system monitor for now. The next best option after this is to press CTRL-ALT-F1 and try to log in as root and find the offending bash parent using ps -A then kill PID... But again, this can take many minutes of your time if you computer is so heavily loaded that it is writing continually to swap.\nSIG TERM exec cpu_broken.sh; reconvene; clear screen; clear thought_processes; continue...\nIs there a better solution?\n\nA: So basically you run a script that makes everything inaccessible, and you want quick and easy solution to stop it . An alternative to powercycling is  to hold SYSRQ key (it's same as PRTSC key in many cases), and press one by one R, E, I,S,U,B. Basically that's a safe way to kill all running processes and restart the system. \nAlternative to that is to do sudo nano /proc/sysrq-trigger, write b , in that file and save. The system will restart immediatelly\nMore info:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key\n\nA: Usually you can use top, htop or similar to find the process and and kill it (or if you know the name or PID of the process, you can killall, pkill etc). For example, using top, I can select a script running from terminal and kill it by pressing k+Enter:\n\nIf that does not work, k+9+Enter should use the SIGKILL signal. SIGKILL requests that the process be  killed immediately, and doesn't wait for the process to finish cleaning up resources etc like SIGTERM does. Ctrl+C a process only sends SIGINT to interrupt the process, like SIGTERM does.\nUsing the the tree view (press t) in htop also eans you can determine the parent processes of a script, and kill those to make sure it does not carry on looping.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unix signal: POSIX signals - Wikipedia\n\n*UNIX man pages: signal (7) (to get a installed version run man 7 signal)\n\n\nA: You need to kill the whole process group. The process group ID (PGID) is the PID of the process that started the group. To kill the process group you need to find the PID of the process that started the process group i.e. the script or command that started it all.  The syntax is:\nkill -- -PGID\n\nFor example:\nkill -- -1234\n\nHere 1234 is the PGID (Process Group ID).\nThis will send SIGTERM to all processes in the process group. To send a different signal e.g. SIGKILL (9) do:\nkill -9 -1234\n\nHow to find the PGID:\nYou can do:\nps -eo 'pid,ppid,pgid,cmd'\n\nThis will shoe the PID, PPID (parent process ID), PGID and the process name.\nNow you can use grep or any other suitable method to find the PGID and then kill it by the methods mentioned above.\nThe reason i have make the command to show PPID is because you can also try to kill the process based on PPID matching by pkill:\npkill -P PPID\n\nFor example:\npkill -P 6789\n\nUsing this method you need to find all the parent (and child processes) and then kill them, so in my opinion killing the whole process tree is a better way if you want to kill all of them.\n", "Q: why is 219 running before the gnome login on my computer? when I restart I get a black screen then a gray screen with a 219 heading and a screen full of entries with ok after some of them and then the gnome login. also after doing a dist upgrade the id in the settings details shows that it has reverted to 14.10 but is still 15.04 i'm confused. \n\nA: 219 is your systemd version.\n% apt-cache policy systemd\nsystemd:\n  Installed: 219-7ubuntu6\n  Candidate: 219-7ubuntu6\n  Version table:\n *** 219-7ubuntu6 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     219-7ubuntu3 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid/main amd64 Packages\n\nsystemd is one of the first things which are activated at startup.\n\nsystemd is a system and service manager for Linux.

I'm very new to Linux so no suggestion is too simple!\nI wouldn't mind a dual boot but I'd prefer a full wipe - any information required feel free to ask.\nThanks.\n\nA: Frankly.. you need to contact Microsoft support to get an installation medium if you don't have a Windows system that you can use to use the official MS download tool. \nYou can then easily delete the Ubuntu installation during the Windows installation.\n\nA: Providing there isn't anything that you want to back up on Ubuntu or the USB drive that you will use for the install, do the following: On another Windows PC, go to the Microsoft Upgrading Windows with only a product key website and download and run the EXE file for Windows 8.1. When given the option click Install Windows by creating media and select the option to create USB media and select your USB (it will be wiped). After this has completed, boot your Ubuntu PC from the USB. How you do this varies depending on your computer make and model so Google is your friend here. In general, press F2, F12 or ESC to launch the boot menu and then select the USB stick with the arrow keys and press Enter. The PC should boot in to the Windows 8.1 install wizard. Go through the wizard and when you get to the partitioning stage, providing you want to completely erase the contents of your hard disk, remove all of the existing partitions and click Next. After the install finishes, the PC should boot in to Windows 8.1. Congratulations!\nPlease note that your hard disk and the USB that you used to install Windows WILL BE WIPED.

I have quite a few Upstart session jobs, that, among other things, start Tor, a development web server, etc. I can use the initctl commands and their abbreviations just fine when I'm logged into the system via the GUI.

You have to set UPSTART_SESSION:\nexport XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)\nexport UPSTART_SESSION=$(initctl list-sessions | awk '{print $2; quit}')\n\nAfter that, it works fine:\n$ status tor9050                                                             \ntor9050 start/running, process 31096\n\n", "Q: Can't connect to Ubuntu server, gives 'no hostkey alg' error I'm trying to connect to my Ubuntu 14.10 server through ssh but whenever I run \nssh -p [port] name@hostname.com\n\nIt simply gives me no hostkey alg and drops the connection.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: Running sudo apt-get purge openssh-server and then running sudo apt-get install openssh-server should fix your problem\n", "Q: Telnet after update to 15.04 not working I updated to 15.04 using the server command sudo do-release-upgrade.\nSince the upgrade was complete and after a reboot, I am unable to telnet to the server.\nPort 23 is not listened while the telnetd, xinetd are configured and restarted.\nI followed instructions on\nTelnet Server not starting\nas well as on \nhttp://ubuntuguide.net/install-and-enable-telnet-server-in-ubuntu-linux\nrestarted a few times but telnet is just not there.

You may be asked a few question, most of which should be answerable by yes or no. Please make sure the PC keeps running and has a permanent internet connection and power supply, if possible. If the computer's battery runs empty or it disconnects from the internet during the upgrade, the OS may be rendered unusable (One of the many reasons to make a backup if your files).

However, the Makefile that qmake generates still sets CC = gcc and CXX = g++. If I manually append -4.8, it does what I want. Why is qmake not generating the Makefile to do that?

I tried to restore from an earlier backup (using the default GUI software) but perplexingly, it didn't restore to my /home partition, but my root partition. Obviously that can't be good. It says there's \"only 0 bytes left\". I can't log in with the GUI now, only terminal works. \nHow do I:\na) revert the changes done to the root drive?

Thanks!\n\nA: Go find where all of the extra files got restored to and delete them.  The fact that you have no space points to you simply restoring the files in the wrong location and so you have duplicates everywhere.  For instance, if you backed up the whole system, but restored it to your home directory, then you have a copy of /bin, /usr, etc in ~/.\n", "Q: Contrail as an install option in Landscape Openstack Auto Pilot Is there an ETA when this functionality will be available in the UI?

I just got a Dell XPS 13 (2015) that came with Ubuntu 14.04 installed, I'd like to upgrade to 15.04, but it doesn't work for me. \n\nA: First, be sure you've done all the 14.04 updates (I had issues just doing this, but after a bunch of reboots and upgrade attempts, you'll eventually get it done). \nSecond, go into Update Manager and tell Ubuntu to show you all available version updates, the default with the pre-installed 14.04 is to show you nothing, not even LTSes. \nThen you have to remove some things that cause issues with the upgrade, install a newer kernel, and update grub: (src)\nsudo dpkg -P oem-audio-hda-daily-dkms\nsudo dpkg -P casper-memdisk\nsudo apt-get install -f linux-image-3.19.0-20-generic\nsudo update-grub\n\nDo NOT REBOOT YET!\nNow upgrade to 14.10 with:\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nThis should bring you up to 14.10. After the reboot into 14.10, check it with lsb_release -a, it should say 14.10. \nNow run sudo do-release-upgrade again to upgrade to 15.04 or run \"Software Updater\" and it should say 15.04 is available and ask you to upgrade (assuming you've set it to notify you of non LTS versions). \nBoom, that should be it. I had no issues going this route. \nIf you lose wireless, apparently you can do a usb tether. Plug your phone into the usb port and turn on usb tethering, then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade. Did not test this. \n", "Q: Do I need to install g++ to compile c++ files in Ubuntu 14.04.1? I am using Ubuntu 14.04.1\nI want to know,\nDo I need to install g++ from the Ubuntu Software Center to compile the c++ files? \nIs GCC(GNU Compiler Collection) able to accomplish this instead?\nif the answer for my 1st question is, yes... \nthen, why doesn't Ubuntu 14.04 come with a c++ compiler? After all it is also just as important as GCC? Why will a c++ compiler not ship with a default Ubuntu installation?\n\nA: You will need something that can compile C++ files. The two main compilers in Linux are GCC and Clang. GCC is the default compiler in Ubuntu.\nGCC isn't installed by default because not everyone needs to compile a file. GCC is typically only used by developers. However, you can easily install it by installing the build-essential package, which is a metapackage that installs gcc (for compiling C files), g++ (for compiling C++ files), and the C library headers.\n\nA: You don't need g++ to compile c++ programs if you have a set of c++ libs. Installed use the proper library flags. Say we want to use gnu's stdc++:\ngcc -o target source.cpp -L/usr/lib/architecture & distro dependent/ -lstdc++\n\nand for a long time the guiding people of GNU/Linux where c oriented so until some what recently distros had to package a c compiler with the c++ portions optional.  Now I can't say what Ubuntu packages by default since my first command on a new system is often sudo apt-get update && apt-get install g++\n", "Q: how can I get ubuntu 15.04 to boot up with my Nvidia geforce 960 GPU So I've recently installed Ubuntu as a secondary operating system on my computer alongside windows 8.1, and I've discovered that it refuses to boot up with my Nvidia 960 GPU installed. I've repeatedly installed and reinstalled the 349 driver by taking out the GPU and using the commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mamarley/nvidia\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-349\nbut every time I try to boot up ubuntu normally with the GPU installed I'm left with a black screen. I've been managing to boot up ubuntu using recovery mode, but I'm looking for a more permanent fix. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong or what I can try?\n\nA: Try to install an nvidia driver from the official repos (instead of the ppa), for example using the Additional Drivers application, while your Nvidia card is not connected. \nIf that doesn't work, and assuming that your CPU has a built-in GPU, I suggest you remove all driver-related ppas and nvidia drivers first. Add the following lines to a new file, for example disablenouveau.conf, in /etc/modprobe.d/:\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\nalias nouveau off\nalias lbm-nouveau off\n\nsave, and then run \nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nAlso add nouveau.modeset=0 to your /etc/default/grub in the kernel parameters line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nouveau.modeset=0\"\n\nand run sudo update-grub. You could also do this directly in the grub boot screen if you need to, as explained in How do I add a kernel boot parameter?. \nShutdown, re-install your graphics card and then boot the machine. This time, the system should start using default Intel/radeon/amdgpu drivers depending on what CPU you have. Now install the latest nvidia driver available in the Additional Drivers dialog. Such a process had fixed my issue with an Intel Core i7 Haswell and Nvidia GTX 860M.\n", "Q: Unable to Edit Display Settings in 15.04 I just installed 15.04 on a new machine, and when I click on the gear icon in the top right, click System Settings, and click Displays, nothing happens.

I am running Ubuntu server on a Virtualbox on a Windows 8 machine so I can install Omeka and build content prior to finding a hosted solution. \nI installed Ubuntu and tried to configure the LAMP but when I would access \"localhost\" or \"127.0.0.1\" from my web browser there was nothing there.  I ran \"iconfig\" and tried the IP provided there and it worked! So I installed Omeka and went through that configuration and now when I go to the IP that did work I can the message that \"index.php\" is missing. \nSo how can I resolve this?

I noticed when I tried to use bash's 'date' inside a command, I could not, when I tried to pick up a file that varies by date. \n\nA: The problem is that cron treats % as newlines. From man 5 crontab:\nPercent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (\\), \nwill be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first %  will  be\nsent to the command as standard input.\n\nTo solve that you need to escape the % by \\%.\nAlternately if you want to run the command from a bash script, make the script executable and put it e.g. like below from crontab -e:\n05 06 * * * /path/to/script.sh\n\nMake the shebang of the script as:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nNow the bash script will be run everyday at 6:05 AM.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run wndows 8.1 on vmware player on a Ubuntu Pc?

My parents say that my computer cannot run Linux. There are some programs that I want on PC. \nHere are my specs:\nProcessor: Intel(R) Celron(R) CPU N2840 @ 2.16GHz 2.16 GHz\nRAM: 2GB\nSystem Type: Windows 64 Bit\nWhat are the perks of Linux and can I install Windows if I don't like Linux?\n\nA: Well this is always fun to say: Your parents are WRONG! \nYour computer can easily run Linux. In fact, you don't need to decide on Linux or Windows, because you can have both! This is called dual booting and it is very simple. Basically, upon startup, you chose from a menu  (Called GRUB) whether you want to boot into Windows or Linux.\nIf you eventually decide you don't like Linux, removing Linux is very easy on a dual boot system. See here. If this link doesn't work, try here\n\nA: Moving from Windows can be hard and the shock of a new system can sometimes put people of sticking with the new OS. All I would say is stay with it if you can as it will all be worth it in the end. You have the option to duel boot or you can go for a vm option. This is possibly the one that I would go for in your current situation. That way, you can keep the current Windows that you have and also try the new OS. From the sounds of it, your machine will be more than able to run Linux. \nYou can dip your toes, as they say, without going all the way. There could be problems with the duel boot and that may stuff up your original system. The vm option would be safer. Whatever you decide, remember to back up your data.\nYou can install Wine which will allow you to run your favourite programs from windows, whilst in Ubuntu. If you look around, you will probably find that there is a great selection of free Linux alternatives out there, that you can move over to.\nAs one of the Big Issue sellers was saying the other day I went past him \"Give it a go, your mum will never know\" lol.\n\nA: Going off what grammer geek said, you can easily have both windows and linux on your computer. I reccomend using rufus or the universal usb installer to create a bootable usb, it makes the process of setting up a dual boot very easy. The advantages and disadvantages vary by user, but here are the biggest advanteges I believe linux offers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer programming: linux provides an open source platform that makes writing software less of a hassel. \n\n*Customizability: with the options available, you can make your desktop experience very personalized. I have so many keyboard shortcuts setup in my kubuntu install I barely have to use the mouse. \nDisadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Slightly higher maintanence: This will depend a lot on what you plan to do with it, but in general i find linux to require a bit more effort than windows to make a pleasing experience. \n\n*Support and compatibilty: Dont get me wrong, in many areas linux is more compatable than windows, but in terms of every day desktop use, its probably going to be a bit harder to find the right drivers and such. This applies to gaming especially. \nObviously there are a lot more pros and cons, but i hope this helps you get a better idea of what your looking at. If you have windows 7, its really easy to set up a dual boot and try it out for yourself. Windows 8 is a little harder but still not too bad. There a plenty of tutorials.

A simple way of checking is to pass the first line of your file through od -c. Doing that on the text from your pastebin (need to download the original, copy/paste won't work), I get:\n$ head -1 dmvHuedP.asc | od -c\n0000000       a   d   a   p   t   e   c   .   m   i   b   ,   s   C   S\n0000020   I   S   m   a   r   t   1   ,   .   1   .   3   .   6   .   1\n0000040   .   4   .   1   .   7   9   5   .   2   .   5   .   0   .   1\n0000060   0   1   ,   C   R   I   T   I   C   A   L   ,  \\r  \\n\n0000076\n\nSo, the \\r was indeed the problem. Next time, you can use dos2unix to remove these:\n$ head -1 dmvHuedP.asc | dos2unix | od -c\n0000000       a   d   a   p   t   e   c   .   m   i   b   ,   s   C   S\n0000020   I   S   m   a   r   t   1   ,   .   1   .   3   .   6   .   1\n0000040   .   4   .   1   .   7   9   5   .   2   .   5   .   0   .   1\n0000060   0   1   ,   C   R   I   T   I   C   A   L   ,  \\n\n0000075\n\nJust run\ndos2unix file > newfile\n\nAlternatively, you can use standard UNIX tools:\ntr -d  '\\r' < file > newfile\nsed -i 's/\\r//g' file\n\n\nA: As per your comment, you probably had some weird character somewhere in your script.\nThe most straightforward solution in this case, having the input file and the script have been posted to paste.ubuntu.com and having them been cleaned after the upload, as I suggested you in the comments and as you did is to delete mibwithtraps and bashscript recreating them copy-pasting the version on paste.ubuntu.com.\n", "Q: How to create shortcut of executable on Unity launcher?

I have Ubuntu precise running on a VPS (server). I am connected with SSH and would like to upgrade to Ubuntu trusty.\nI do not want the newest release. Changing /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades to \"normal\" causes the do-release-upgrade shell script to select the next release (12.10), not 13.x. Selecting LTS goes straight to 14.x. How do I specify 13.x release?\nWould I have to manually change the /apt/sources.list to point to trusty and then do a dist-upgrade? I prefer to do it with the do-release-upgrade script, but can't figure out how.\n\nA: 14.04 is the next LTS release after 12.04.\nIt's what you want on a server. They last for five years after release (rather than nine months).\nThe only upgrade path that supports skipping versions is the LTS→LTS one. You cannot jump from 12.04 to 13.x. Neither would you want to; both 13.x releases have been dead for some time.\nThe latest LTS is currently 14.04 and the latest non-LTS is 15.04. The next LTS will probably be 16.04.

I want to dual boot my system to run both Ubuntu and Windows 7. The engineer told me I cannot do this without removing Windows 7, and downloading Ubuntu first. Then downloading Windows.\nI have already paid for windows 7 once, doing what the engineer told me means either downloading a pirated version or buying windows again. \nIs there no other way?\n\nA: I think you have been misled by the engineer.\nIf you really want do dual boot ubuntu with win7, that is a fairly straightforward process.\nUbuntu will happily co-exist in a dual-boot configuration with windows, with windows first to be in place. The opposite scenario is actually the more troublesome to setup. Windows can clobber the MBR+grub setup and render Ubuntu unable to boot but in the scenario you have got, it should not be a problem.\nThe main question - is do you have sufficient disk space to accomodate the Ubuntu install. You'll have to probably resize your existing Win7 partition to make some space available for ubuntu.\nIf you run the ubuntu installer, you can do the resize using GParted.\nYou can also resize the windows partition using windows Disk Management.\nAfter resizing partitions, you should be able to able to smoothly run Ubuntu install.\nThere shouldn't be any issues with the Win7 license.\nAs a fallback, you can run a clone image backup of your current disk state which you can restore just in case you need to.\n\nA: If partitioning and bootloaders and so on sounds too difficult, just start with VirtualBox. https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\nIn your virtualbox make a Virtual Machine, and install Ubuntu in it. Then just use the windows as host, make the VM fullscreen and enjoy Ubuntu.\n\nA: In relation to the stuff of resizing a Windows partition (Control Panel -> Search by 'partition' word -> Create and format hard disk partitions) inside Windows (except in XP) to free space for Ubuntu, I used my own system. In the next image:\n \nI shrunk (the menu appears with right buttom of mouse) the second NTFS partition (C, with Windows 7) in 30 GB. The process it took only a few seconds. The result can be observed at the next image (free space with the black label):\n \nAfterward, I reverted this process in about a second by using the tool for extending the C partition. Nothing bad happened. I am posting from Windows 7. \nBack to Ubuntu again! \n\nA: *\n\n*It's possible to resize the Windows partition with Windows still on it. It can go wrong, but it generally doesn't.\n\n*Download a legal version if you already have a Windows license. If you install the same version (Home Premium) on the same machine then your Windows key (the xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx code on a sticker on your machine) will be accepted for the reinstall. It's a good idea to have a copy to hand if you are going to resize the Windows partition in-place as, as I said, it can sometimes go wrong.\nMore generally, what would you do if your Windows install got messed up and you had to install it anyway?\nIf your sticker with the key has become unreadable due to wear and tear, it's possible to get Windows installations to reveal their keys.\n\nA: Who told you that? In my experience it was always easier to install Windows first (or keep the pre-installed one) and install linux afterwards. The windows license is not affected anyway. \nBut it might be that there is some recovery partition from your manufacturer you must get rid of. It should be documented on Dell's site how to do that. \n\nA: I wouldn't even bother dual booting... It is easier to get another hard drive and replace the win 7 one (put it away safely) and install ubuntu on the new drive. You can pick up a small solid state drive cheaply - my main ubuntu PC runs off a 30Gb OCZ solid state drive. Over the years I have found dual booting a complete pain, especially with multiple partitions, hidden partitions and boot loaders.\nIf you do it this way, there is no reinstall of windows required if it goes pear shaped, your windows is completely safe..\n\nA: I think the engineer was confused. He got it wrong. But there is one small thing that you must note. It won't void your license, but it will void your warranty agreement with Microsoft, idk to what extent, but Windows customer care will decline you telephone support. It will not void the warranty on the hardware but it would severely limit the OS support you can receive if needed. This will happen if windows came pre-installed with the laptop. I had the experience myself. In my case, I accidently told the Microsoft support guy over telephone that I am dual booting with linux.\nIf you read through the Windows 8 Hardware Certification Requirements for Client and Server Systems, found here: Windows Hardware Certification Requirements for Client and Server Systems , you will read about functionality you are supposed to have, that OEM's agree to - that you may not find in your system. Because Microsoft subsidizes these systems they do not have to allow support for dual booting with a Non Microsoft system.\nBut that's no big deal. Only that you won't get support over phone from Microsoft. The best solution to all of this is to make Recovery Disks, so that you can reset back to 'before dual booting' if ever you want.\n\nA: I don't know how everyone missed the most simple option. Run Ubuntu inside Windows, with the exception of it being able to boot.  \nIt's the WUBI option. Detailed guide is available here -\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi\nThe original partitions or the Windows installation is not disturbed at all.  Ubuntu installs in a folder and updates boot options to allow booting either Windows or Ubuntu. \nI have done it on a desktop as well as a laptop, both of which had Windows pre-installed. \n\nA very old desktop with Windows XP, and Ubuntu in a folder on the D partition\n\nA: If you don't switch every day, consider a new hard drive:  Use a brand new hard drive without Windows.  You could then use dual/triple boot for the option of deciding on your favorite flavor of Linux and easily changing based on the latest release and updates.  I would choose Fedora, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint.  I would install Linux Mint last because it is easy to update the default, and you have to reinstall for the next release version anyway.  It is worth it, because Mint is doubly tweaked:  Ubuntu is an improved version of Debian, and Mint is an improved version of Ubuntu.  If you are new to Linux, Mint is by far the best (MATE for old machines/Cinnamon for newer hardware; you can add KDE, XFCE, or LXDE later if you want to try non-Gnome desktops).  If you are experienced and like RPMs (Red Hat Package Manager for additions and updates), Fedora is your best bet (Or Scientific Linux for old machines).  Don't be intimidated by the many choices:  they all work, and you should make your best guess which one suits you and your hardware.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make ubuntu logless Can I disable the logging features for any app running under Ubuntu? \nI want to make my system totally logless is it possible?\n\nA: If you  want to disable all logs:\nRun this command to stop the log daemon.\nsudo stop rsyslog \n\nTo disable starting the daemon from boot create a file called /etc/init/rsyslog.override with a line containg the word \"manual\"\nYou can do this with the following command:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/init/rsyslog.override\n\nNow add the word \nmanual\n\nThen save and exit.\nOr do it in single command:\necho \"manual\" | sudo tee --append /etc/init/rsyslog.override\n\n\nA: tmpfs can be used for log/tmp/spool directories. Then after reboot, they are totally cleared. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs\n$ sudo vim /etc/fstab      \ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,size=2024M,mode=1777 0 0            \ntmpfs /var/spool tmpfs defaults,noatime,size=512M,mode=1777 0 0\ntmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,size=512M,mode=1777 0 0\ntmpfs /var/log tmpfs defaults,noatime,size=512M,mode=0755 0 0\n\n", "Q: Nautilus - screen tearing after scrolling When I scroll in Nautilus some entries don't refresh properly.\n\nIt doesn't matter if I scroll with the scroll wheel on my mouse or with page-up, page-down, home or end keys.

But when I open that folder it takes forever to load and display miniatures. \nThere's just \"Loading...\" sometimes without an end. Is there way to do so?\nI have Ubuntu 14.04. \n\nA: I'd suggest splitting the files into separate subfolders using the command line before proceeding to view your files. Its unlikely that you will be able to productively view and browse the images until you reduce the file count per folder.\nFor example you can split the files by date. If there is a date stamp in the file, you can use a command like\ncd /images-dir\nmkdir 20150401\nmv *20150401* 20150401\n\nThe cd command will take you to your image directory. The mkdir is to create a subfolder.

Logging in via the console worked just fine, just as well as logging in from the host machine over ssh with the same username.

But now you want to allow this KIOSK to be used by Public locations\n2 - Because it has to run in Public locations there are many issues. To get prevent from all the issues there is this tool call DeepFreeze. You can install it once and make everything frozen. Which allow the users to work day and night without cause any problem in the PC.\n3 - When the PC is rebooted, DeepFreeze automagically restore to the position when DeepFreeze was applied.\nThis prevent the system to run 24/7 in a public location or in a location where you want to deploy reliable, stable release for not to expect any new surprises.\nDeepFreeze provide that solution and its very easy to configure takes about 4 to 5 minutes.\n\nA: There's some open source software called OFRIS that does exactly what your looking for.

For this I needed to set an ip address in one of my interfaces(eth0).\nAfter I close GNS3, and failed to get internet from port.

But I can't use it when I login the other normal user account.\nIs is possible to set the applications to be for all users, so that I need not install them again the in other accounts?\n\nA: I'm going to assume you installed wine via apt-get from the typical repositories or that you added a ppa for wine and installed it from there or generally just have wine installed such that any user can run it.  If you have some other setup, add a comment and I'll update my post.\nSo, here's what needs to be done:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to put the files somewhere that all the users that will be running wine can read/write.\n\n*You need to set the permissions on the directories and files so that all the users that will be running wine can use them.\n\n*You need to update any paths that refer to the old location\n\n\nFor 1 -- You can just copy the files to a common location, such as /opt/windows.  To do this: sudo cp -r /root/.wine /opt/windows\nFor 2 -- If you have more than one user that will be using the various windows applications, you will need to make sure they are all part of a common group, or if you only have one user you can set the owner to that user.\nOption a:\nIf you have one user, just change the owner recursively for the directory.  This is easier, so I'll describe this first:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/windows\n\nOption b:\nIf you have multiple users, then you need to create a new group, change the ownership of the directory to the new group, set file permissions, and then log out and back in so the new group settings take effect.  don't do this if you used the previous method of just one user.\nsudo groupadd wine\nsudo usermod -a -G wine $USER\nsudo chgrp -R /opt/windows\nsudo chmod -R g+rw /opt/windows\nsudo find /opt/windows -type d | while read DIR ; do sudo chmod g+rwx \"${DIR}\" ; done\n#this is where you would log out and back in.\n\nAlso, whenever you add a new user to the system and that user will be using wine, add them to the group: sudo usermod -a -G wine NEW_USER\nFor 3 --\nWhen you run wine it puts files in ~/.wine/.  Some of these files contain absolute paths.  Since you've moved /root/.wine to /opt/windows, these paths need to be updated.  You can manually update these by using winecfg and updating the \"Links to\" entries for all the folders under the \"Desktop Integration\" tab.  If you created a new group for the user, then you need to have logged out and back in before you do this.  To do this, set the prefix for wine and run winecfg: \nWINEPREFIX=/opt/windows winecfg\n\nOnce the paths have been updated, click okay and you should be ready to run any of the applications as a normal user.\nBefore you run any applications, you will need to set WINEPREFIX to /opt/windows.  If there are any \".desktop\" files for applications you have installed, you need to modify them to include the WINEPREFIX.  You could also put export WINEPREFIX=/opt/windows in your .bash_profile or .bashrc so you don't have to manually specify it at the command line.\n\nIf you can update your question with a description of how you launch any of the installed applications I can further cater the answer.\nAlso, as an aside, when I install new applications through wine, I tend to use a different WINEPREFIX for each application.  That way if they have strange settings or incompatible dependencies, I don't inadvertently break old applications when installing new applications.  Then, for dependencies, I use winetricks to fetch and install.\n\nA: Unfortunately it seems wine checks owner of the prefix directory. Unsure if it checks for every file, but it seems to do for $WINEPREFIX (default ~/.wine) on recent versions. \nI ran into the problem after having created a group and adding users to that group. Winedebug just complains about other users not being owner. My guess is best option is leaving .wine where it is (~/.wine) and try setting up a drive_d  with shared ownerships inside (). Not sure if it will work, but I am sure shared ownership of .wine / WINEPREFIX will give problems not mentioned here. Would be nice you could make a common user too with no rights except to read/write files for wine and no need for password. Haven't seen any suggestions how to set this all up for wine.\n", "Q: Shutdown, restart and suspend problems on Acer E5 511 (Sandy Bridge) 14.04 and 15.04 Lot's of similar problems out there. Basically I have tried most or all of the suggestions offed but to no avail.\nSpecifically. I installed Unity 15.04 on two Acer E5 511 C1WE laptops and it seems to work great in UEFI with secure boot turned off, a bit shaky in legacy, seems more flickery and unstable in boot up, but it still works fine, both modes on both laptops suffer from the same problem as follows:\nShutdown, restart and suspend all require me to hard restart, screen goes dark and I get this message:\n[ OK ] Started Light Display Manager.\n[ OK ] Started ACPI event daemon.\n       Starting ACPI event daemon...\n       Starting Network Manager Script Dispatcher Service....\n[ OK ] Started Network Manager Script Dispatcher Service.\n\nsystem then tries to reboot and hangs. I hard Shutdown with the button.When I restart typically it will hang again, sometimes even twice before I get a clean boot. I get GRUB options and sometimes not?\nI have two identical laptops here and I am getting consistent results from both so I can count out it just being this unit. \nAnyway I would be happy to provide more info. I am quietly hopping that this will get sorted soon in an update, as it seems to be a broad sweeping issue. But as a recent convert to Ubuntu I can't assume that?\nThanks!\n\nA: I can offer no guarantees on this, but you might look into the reboot= kernel option. As documented in the kernel source tree's Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt file:\nreboot=         [KNL]\n                Format (x86 or x86_64):\n                        [w[arm] | c[old] | h[ard] | s[oft] | g[pio]] \\\n                        [[,]s[mp]#### \\\n                        [[,]b[ios] | a[cpi] | k[bd] | t[riple] | e[fi] | p[ci]] \\\n                        [[,]f[orce]\n                Where reboot_mode is one of warm (soft) or cold (hard) or gpio,\n                      reboot_type is one of bios, acpi, kbd, triple, efi, or pci,\n                      reboot_force is either force or not specified,\n                      reboot_cpu is s[mp]#### with #### being the processor\n                                to be used for rebooting.\n\nTo use these options, you'll need to edit your GRUB (or other boot loader) configuration. You can do this on a one-time basis in GRUB by hitting e rather than Enter to launch your kernel. This will give you a simple text editor in which you can change the kernel options. If you find something that works, use GRUB Customizer to set it up permanently.\nIf you use something other than GRUB, you'll need to consult the program's documentation to learn how to make changes. (Most make it easier than GRUB to customize settings, at least if you're comfortable editing configuration files.)\n", "Q: Creating alias in zshrc from json file Does anyone know how to create alias in zshrc by reading reading JSON file from local machine\nE.g.: my JSON file names is ip.json is as\n{\"local\":\"127.0.0.1\"}\n\nand want to create alias in zshrc as\nalias local = \"ssh root@127.0.0.1\"\n\n\nA: You can use the jq tool (available via apt-get) for that.\nIf the file ip.json has a json object that each key is a different host.

I'm new to Linux. \nSo I'm interested about getting better performance of my laptop. \nLaptop: DELL: Intel CPU i7-4510U 2.00x4 , Graphics: Intel Haswell Mobile 4400 and Ati Radeon R270, 1TB HDD, 8GB RAM 1600mhz.\nI'm using laptop for android and web development ( app. android studio (mostly testing app via emulator), Eclipse..). \nSo what value should I use for swap? \nThanks. \n\nA: Swap size\nFrom a default Ubuntu installation we will have automatically created a /swap partition having a reasonable size. There are few cases only when changing this default value may be needed (e.g. being prepared to upgrade RAM later).\nTo get an idea if changing your swap size would give you any benefits it is probably a good idea to just see how much of it is acutally used by issueing the following command in a terminal:\nfree\n\nThis will give you all memory availble, and used, uncluding RAM and swap. Only if that value reaches the upper limit of your swap size it would make sense to increase it. If it always is at the lower level of usage reducing its size will not influence system performance and may not be worth the hassle (note that we should not completely disable swap).\nSwappiness\nMore than swap size \"swappiness\" may influence system performance, as this value will determine how swap will be used by the kernel. Still, the default swappiness value of 60 is a sensible value and we should not need to change it. See this very nice question and answer on more background about swappiness. Please also consider that as a beginner to Ubuntu it may not be such a good idea to play aroung with system internals (at least not without a full system backup which will enable you to restart from scratch).\nWhat else?\nPerhaps more than CPU power (which you may not be able to change so easily anyway) are the following:\n\n*\n\n*have a working graphics driver installed to use the ATI card rather than the inbuilt Intel graphics.\n\n*consider replacing a slow laptop hard drive by a fast SSD (this will do miracles).\n\n*further increase RAM size (may speed things up, but only if running multiple applications in parallel or for graphics or video editing).\n\n", "Q: is there frame server software for ubuntu(linux)? I use Adobe Premier for editing videos on some client PCs and I want to render my videos on an ubuntu server by ffmpeg commands.In the words instead of rendering the Premier project by it's own encoder I want to do it with ffmpeg on a linux OS. I know that distributing the rendering process can be done by using frame serving . For now the only way that I have found for doing this is using Debugmode Frameserver along with AviSynth . But the problem is that Debugmode Frameserver only has Windows based application however AviSynth is available on linux . \nNow can any one tell me how may I do this . Is there any linux alternative for Debugmode Frameserver or is there any other way for doing this?\nNot that I want to do this on a linux server which means it doesn't have any GUI.\n\nA: you can do this by using ffmpeg, Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*First do steps of the second method(\"Use a frameserver\") on  this page (\"How to encode with ffmpeg from Adobe Premiere Pro\") \n\n*Beginng this step you should be streaming your Premier timeline through Debugmode and Avisynth on a specific IP and port. Now open a command line and run this ffmpeg command:\nffmpeg -i frameserver.avs -f mpegts  tcp://[IP address of your server]:[open port on your server]\nby running this command you are sendnig Avisynth output(streaming) to a distination machine(your linux server) throught ffmpeg.\nAfter this step all you have to do on the client server(where you edit your videos) is done , now let's go to the server side.\n\n\n*on the server (your linux server) simply run the below ffmpeg command and you are done:(assumung you have ffmpeg installed on your server)\nffmpeg -i tcp://[your server IP]:[The same port you entered in step 2]?listen -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a libfdk_aac -vbr 4 output2.mp4\nby this command ffmpeg will be listenning on a specified IP and port and recieving sent packets and encode them with your favorite options!\n\nA: I don't really understand how Debugmode Frameserver and AviSynth interact in your usecase. Is AviSynth listening on a port or socket on the target machine where Debugmode Frameserver sends the data to? I didn't know that AviSynth could do that.\nI know that AviSynth is a frameserver itself built for Windows. There have been a several efforts to bring AviSynth functionality to Linux or make it cross platform, the latest and most promising one is VapourSynth.\nIf Debugmode Frameserver needs to run on the target machine to try using it with Wine. A few years back running AviSynth with Wine was tricky though somehow possible and stable, but VapourSynth was more reliable and less painful on Windows last time I tried. Since then all necessary parts seem to have been ported to VapourSynth to make filters like QTGMC work natively.\n", "Q: Error while starting apache2 service I get an error when I run this command\nsudo service apache2 start\nThis is the error\n* Starting web server apache2                                      \nAH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1.

If you have the server under your control, than you might also share directory with the menu through NFS and the client machines would just test whether the NFS drive is mounted and if yes, then it would copy from NFS to the local directory instead of using wget.\nThe actual implementation might depend on how the webpage is complicated, what firewalls you have, etc. If you use bash scripts, instead of just running browser, you might build in some additional logic that warns that the menu might be old or something like this.\n", "Q: What's the scope of `ufw` and its implicit Deny rule with regards to my network? Is the implicit deny of UFW only for when people are connecting to its IP address or for the whole network? I have tried telnet to the IP address and yes it gets denied but when I tried to telnet to another IP in the network it was able to connect shouldn't it be denied as well?\n\nA: Based on your comments, I think you've failed to understand what ufw is, and what the scope of coverage is for software firewalls on individual systems.\n\nThis is a breakdown of the situation, and provides insight into the specifics of ufw and the rules on a network:\n\n\n*\n\n*ufw will only affect one system - the system it's enabled on.  That is to say, Ubuntu System #1 (for sake of keeping track) has ufw enabled with an implicit deny rule.  That only affects Ubuntu System #1, and replaces the default \"ACCEPT\" rule that exists on the underlying iptables/netfilter system (of which ufw is just a 'easy to manage' front end for).\n\n*Since Ubuntu System #2 does not have ufw enabled on it, there is no \"deny\" rule on it.  Since ufw isn't there, the underlying iptables/netfilter system gets the default \"ACCEPT\" rule that is put in place on install (ufw changes those rules, and is just an 'easy to manage' front end for those).\n\n*Windows Firewall on Windows XP (if enabled) will be able to deny connections to the Windows machine.  It cannot affect other systems on the network\n\n\nIf you want Ubuntu System #2 to have the deny rule, install ufw on that system, enable it, and then the implicit deny rule will exist.\n\nWhat you want, though,  is a network-wide access control rule, controlling what traffic is permitted between systems.  The only way to achieve this is to move the firewall and network controls to its own device, a separate Ubuntu box handling routing of traffic between all systems on your network, or a hardware Firewall to achieve this (such as a Cisco ASA, or a pfSense appliance).\nConsider the following network:\nI have a LAN network, and there's a router handling connections out from LAN to Internet (or other networks).  Every computer has 192.168.252.XXX, with static addressing.  Five computers are on that segment of the network.  I want to restrict communication between the machines to be ICMP PING packets only, and apply that restriction to all machines.\nMy options for implementation are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install software firewalls on each machine, and configure the software firewalls to accept only certain types of traffic from the other machines on the network to each computer.  However, allow all traffic between each system and the gateway/router.\n\n*Install a hardware firewall that suits your network setups to replace the router, and provide explicit rule definition for permitted intra-network traffic (internal to the specific LAN) and inter-network traffic (communication between networks, so outside your LAN).  Configure as follows\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure the hardware firewall to allow outbound to the Internet (a rule basically saying Anything Internal -> Anything Not Internal (NOT 192.168.252.0/24) is ALLOWED).\n\n*Configure the hardware firewall for the LAN itself for ALLOWED inter-system traffic, in this case ICMP only (a rule basically saying anything from 192.168.252.0/24 to 192.168.252.0/24 where the protocol is ICMP).\n\n*Any traffic patterns that do not match aforementioned rules is automatically denied.\n\n\n*Replace the router with an Ubuntu box with enough ethernet ports to provide enough connections for your network and Wireless if you need it, configure it to do DHCP, NAT, etc., and configure the firewall rules on the Ubuntu box to handle traffic both inside and outside the network (similar to previous).\n\nTo provide you with another point of view, though, which drives this answer, my network at home has a lot of LAN segments (as VLANs, or Virtual LANs).  I use a hardware firewall (a pfSense appliance, $500ish) to handle the VLANs on my network (DHCP, NAT out to the Internet, etc.), as well as inter-communication rules between the segments, which restrict access.  Machines I actively use exist on one VLAN, whereas restricted-access machines exist on a separate VLAN and network range.  Communication to those is restricted by a rule on both sides which dictates what traffic is permitted to pass between the segments.  Essentially, this is the second option from above, implemented in a much more advanced way.\n", "Q: Ubuntu live usb and installation freezes the problem is, that the ubuntu 15.04 64bit as well as the 14.04 64bit live usb I created freezes at random points during the installation as well as when I use it as a live cd. \nI verified the usb via md5, tried different usb sticks and four different ways of creating it (ubuntu, ubuntu unetbootin, mac dd, mac unetbootin) and still it freezes.\nI have a pretty new setup:\n- i7-3930K, \n- 16 gb ram, \n- MSI R7 260X \n- Samsung MZ-7TE250KW 250GB ssd\nI also tried setting nomodeset, but to no avail.

So in your case I would open ~/.profile in emacs and then type\nC-x ( C-s #Set environment variable C-a C-k C-k C-k C-x )\n[which, in words, does this: C-x ( means \"start learning this\"; C-s means \"search for\", so then we search for #Set environment variable, and then C-a means \"back to the beginning of the line, and the three C-k's mean \"delete this line\", and finally C-x ) means \"stop learning this\".]\nAfter those commands have been typed once, emacs has deleted three lines, but it has also learnt how to do it by heart, so you can now type\nC-x e\nand it will do it again, or\nC-u 100 C-x e\nand it will do it 100 times (or stop when it can't find any more lines with \"#Set environment variable\" in).\nThe advantage of using emacs is that you can see your edits happening \"live\", and for a paranoid person like me who is scared that one sed typo can delete lots of stuff that I didn't want deleted, this makes me much happier [the moment things go wrong in emacs you can just go backwards and fix them with C-_].\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Issues setting up email encryption in Thunderbird with Enigmail I am having trouble setting up Email Encryption in Thunderbird using Enigmail.

In this way, you must cut off the file names and sort, using |cut -d\\  -f1 and |sort to sort the generated hashes. Use this with both dirs, and push the output to a file for each dir:\nfind path/to/dir1 -type f -exec md5sum \"{}\" \\; |cut -d\\  -f1 |sort > /tmp/hashes_dir1\nfind path/to/dir2 -type f -exec md5sum \"{}\" \\; |cut -d\\  -f1 |sort > /tmp/hashes_dir2\n\nAfter that, you can just compare the generated files:\ndiff /tmp/hashes_dir1 /tmp/hashes_dir2\n\nIf the output of the above is empty, both dir's files have the same content. \nIf not (for example, there is a duplicated files only in one directory), the output will not be empty.\nEdit:\nAdditionally, you can see the correspondent files cutting off the cut and the sort pipes from the two first commands, pushing the output to the same file, and printing the file with cat and a pipe with sort to compare:\nfind path/to/dir1 -type f -exec md5sum \"{}\" \\; > /tmp/hashes_dir\nfind path/to/dir2 -type f -exec md5sum \"{}\" \\; >> /tmp/hashes_dir\ncat /tmp/hashes_dir |sort\n\nThe correspondent files will appear one next to the other.\nEdit2: To see how it works: http://pastebin.com/dW7LrZkR\n", "Q: How to create primary partition after having an extended one?

Can someone tell me if it does or doesent (I don't care about losing files on the old Ubuntu (which I cannot load (lost boot menu) ) but I NEED the files on Windows 7.\nSo, In the end, I just need to know if re-installing Ubuntu (on dual boot with Windows 7 & 10 technical preview) will get rid of Windows 7 And Windows 10 Technical preview.\nNeed an answer Quite Quick!\n(plus if you have the link to a question that might answer mine, leave that in the comment)\n\nA: \nSo, In the end, I just need to know if re-installing Ubuntu (on dual\n  boot with Windows 7 & 10 technical preview) will get rid of Windows 7\n  And Windows 10 Technical preview.\n\nIt depends on how you install Ubuntu. What you want to do is dual boot with Ubuntu. Follow the instructions in the top answer here to preserve Windows and add Ubuntu. \n\nA: Before reinstalling a new Ubuntu you should try to reinstall grub. Sometimes a new installation of Windows erases it.\nAnyway a new installation of Ubuntu should not erase existing Windows.\n\nA: As long as you install Ubuntu in a partition not being used by either installed copy of Windows, it will not overwrite your Windows installs.  The bootloader installation step of the Ubuntu install should detect your Windows installs and add them to your grub menu (the \"purple boot menu\").\n\nA: Just head to the official Ubuntu Boot-repair documentation and follow instructions there.  That's the least risky of all solutions.\nThat being said, always take back-ups of your entire PC (a.k.a. a \"System Backup\") before you attempt dangerous things like installing Windows 10 preview...  ;-)\n", "Q: how to automatically add IP address to list of known host when ssh?

Is there an easy way I could remove this gradient?\n\nA: You can edit it with GIMP or other image editors, because the .png files are stored in \n/usr/share/unity/icons\n\nThe name of the files are category_gradient.png and  category_gradient_no_refine.png.\n", "Q: can't resolve 'ph.archive.ubuntu.com' I am trying to install cmake and it said try running sudo apt-get install cmake. Then I entered Y but after a while the terminal displayed can't resolve 'ph.archive.ubuntu.com'. Is there really an instance when a server goes down/offline? \n\nA: If your system can't resolve, that is a DNS problem (or, in some cases but not in that case, in /etc/hosts file). Here, I tried to resolve ph.archive.ubuntu.com, and I have got:\n$ host ph.archive.ubuntu.com\n;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\n\nProbably, the Canonical's DNS servers have some issue (or simply it dropped this subdomain for some reason).\n", "Q: Error executing a jar file ubuntu I have been trying for hours on how to get this file to executive. On Windows it starts up successfully but on Ubuntu it does not.\nMy guess is that I don't have permissions to run the file properly. \nBasically I navigate the the folder the jar file is located in with the \nTerminal and type in \n$ java -jar Bot.jar \n\nand I get an error saying \nError: Could not find or load main class net.minecraft.client.Main\n\nIve tried using sudo before the command and using chmod 755 but none of it is working.\nNow like I said before this works fine on Windows and I can't seem to find what my issue is.\n\nA: The error says that there is no main method in the jar file. Not all jar archives are supposed to be executed. Some are libraries, some don't come with a main method on another purpose.\nAn example of latter is the Minecraft client, which seems to be related to your question. It purposely doesn't have a main method as a rudimentary piracy protection. For it to start, it needs a launcher, which connects to the Mojang server, thereby starting a game session, which is then handed over to the client by calling some method in it.\nSo if your file - I'll ignore the naming - is a Minecraft client, you need the launcher to run it.\nIf it is the other way around, and your archive is a Minecraft launcher, you need to tell it where the Minecraft client is located (~/.minecraft/versions/<version>/<version>.jar), maybe by adding it to the PATH environment, maybe by giving it as an argument to the command.\nIf it is a Minecraft mod, you should have installation instructions along with it.\n", "Q: How to use iMac as external monitor for ubuntu laptop I have a 13 inch laptop running ubuntu and an iMac running OSX. I'd like to use the iMac as an external monitor for the laptop.\nThe laptop has VGA and HDMI, and ubuntu 14.04.\nRelated:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/87666/109005\nhttps://superuser.com/q/540547/372305\n\nA: I had the exact same problem. I got this working reliably with a combination of xpra and Xephyr. This solutions of course uses your local network, through ssh, to make an remote display. \nYou need xpra installed on both of your devices and Xephyr on your Ubuntu machine. There is a repo for Ubuntu, which installs Winswitch - which xpra is part of. Winswitch has quite a few cool features.\nAnyway here is how I got it to work:\nOn your Ubuntu machine in terminal:\nxpra start --exit-with-client=yes --speaker=disabled --start-child=\"Xephyr :200 -ac -screen 1920x1080\" :100\n\nDISPLAY=:200 lightdm-session 'gnome-session --session=ubuntu'\n\nWhere \"200\" is the X11 port which Xephyr connects to, and \"100\" is the port made available over the local network.\nOn your Mac in terminal:\n/Applications/Xpra.app/Contents/MacOS/Xpra attach ssh:myusername@192.168.6.123:100\n\nNeedless to say a this solutions is dependent on a wired network.\n\nA: You can use synergy or x2x to accomplish what you want to do. Using synergy is probably easier, and you will be using a simple GUI called QUICKSYNERGY, which you can install to make it easier to use.. \n", "Q: set -n not working in shell script when executing with source this is the shell script..\n#!/bin/bash\nset -n\n<<COMMENT1\n    tHIS IS A MULTILINE COMMENT MAN \n\nCOMMENT1\n<<COMMENT1\nTHII\nCOMMENT1\n:\necho \"this is ashok\"\necho \"${LOGNAME}\"\n\nwhen executing with the sh and ./ its executing fine. but when I executed with source.\nashokkrishna@09:45:56:~/Desktop$ sh hello.sh\nashokkrishna@09:46:02:~/Desktop$ ./hello.sh\nashokkrishna@09:46:23:~/Desktop$ . hello.sh\nthis is ashok\nashokkrishna\n\nwhy the output is coming for the script when I executed with source(.) command.\n\nA: Quoting the docs on the behaviour of an interactive shell:\n\n\n\n*The -n invocation option is ignored, and ‘set -n’ has no effect (see The Set Builtin).\n\n\nSince you sourced the script from an interactive shell, set -n is ignored.\n", "Q: Remove remote playlists from Amarok I've just installed KDE to test it, so Amarok too.

Once I shifted to linux, I decided to dual-boot it with windows 8.1 temporarily. So later when I had no use of windows, I used GParted to format the windows partition.\nWindows was initially installed in /dev/sda4 partition. As you can see it has 1.14GiB of used space even after the format. This is also supported by the fact that the windows boot option in grub takes me to windows recovery. \nI want to know, is there is a way to completely get rid of this? So that I can use all of the 61.43GiB.\n \nAlso, in the above picture /dev/sda is shown to be 931.51GiB (top right corner). But actually my disk capacity is 1TB. What happened to the remaining storage? Is it the BIOS? If not, is there any way I can access it? \n\nA: what you see is value in GiB and not in GB\nlook here: http://wintelguy.com/gb2gib.html\n931.3225746154785 GiB = 1000 GB\n1TB (terabyte) = 0.90949470177293 TiB (tebibyte) = 931 GiB 330 MiB 324 KiB\nSo the answer is, your HDD has the full capacity it's supposed to.\nAlso merging those circa 60 GiB to some of yours partitions is possible, but in your current setup not very safe, moving, stretching would be neccessary and it can go wrong.\nAnswer to your first question is here: New ext4 partition and used space\n\nA: While the disk capacity is 1TB, the actual formatted capacity will be 931.51GB. This is because of the difference between how the OS counts the size, and how the HDD manufacturer counts it. Hardware manufacturers use what's known as a 'decimal byte', which means that they use powers of 10 in calculating size. OSes determine the size using a 'binary byte' instead. It basically means that there's a discrepancy in how it's counted.

I would like to be able to write a bash script to automatically update my MediaWiki extensions and I think I will use this website https://extdist.wmflabs.org/dist/extensions/ to do so. But as you can see there each tarball file name has a random (or so it appears to me) combination of letters and numbers after the final dash (-). So what I would like is some way of downloading only files with this sort of name extname-REL1_25*.tar.gz where * is the place where the wild card in the name would come in and extname refers to the extension I want's name. \n\nA: wget brace expansion\nUse brace expansion with wget to download multiple files according to a pattern.\nExample:\nwget -c https://extdist.wmflabs.org/dist/extensions/GoogleDocTag-REL1_{22-45203b7,23-249c6f2,24-3186a71,25-10e101f}.tar.gz\n\nThe optional -c  flag continues the download if it is paused or interrupted from the same point where it was stopped. The -c option is useful when you are downloading a large number of files and you want to download all of the files in a batch without interruptions.\nwget download multiple files from a list\nExample:\nlynx -dump \"https://extdist.wmflabs.org/dist/skins/\" | awk '/http/{print $2}' | uniq >> list.txt  \nwget -c -E -H -k -K -p -e robots=off -i ./list.txt    \n\nwget recursive accept/reject options\nRecursive Accept/Reject Options\n    -A acclist --accept acclist\n    -R rejlist --reject rejlist\n        Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to\n        accept or reject. Note that if any of the wildcard characters, *,\n        ?, [ or ], appear in an element of acclist or rejlist, it will be\n        treated as a pattern, rather than a suffix.  In this case, you \n        have to enclose the pattern into quotes to prevent your shell \n        from expanding it, like in -A \"*.mp3\" or -A '*.mp3'.\nExample:\nlynx -dump \"https://extdist.wmflabs.org/dist/skins/\" | awk '/http/{print $2}' | uniq >> list.txt  \nwget -c -A \"Vector*.tar.gz\" -E -H -k -K -p -e robots=off -i ./list.txt  \n\nBoth -A and -R options download the all the files and then the accept and reject options delete the downloaded files that don't match the pattern. This is horribly inefficient. A faster way to do it would be to do the pattern matching on the list.txt file to remove all the unwanted files from list.txt before downloading anything.\nSuppose that you want to download all the files from https://extdist.wmflabs.org/dist/extensions/ that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n*\n\n*version 1.25\n\n*only the selected MediaWiki extensions\n\nAssuming that you have already made a list.txt file which contains all the links in https://extdist.wmflabs.org/dist/extensions/, you open list.txt in a text editor that supports pattern matching and filter the contents of list.txt to match lines having the string 1_25 (which refers to version 1.25) and then filter those results to match lines having the ~20 extensions (the number 20 is not important) that you want to download. Then write the results to a new file called new-list.txt (the file name new-list.txt is not important) and download the multiple files (~20 in number in this example) using new-list.txt after wget's -i option to read URLs from a local or external file.\nA further improvement in this method would be to reduce the number of extensions to match by filtering the contents of list.txt to match extensions containing strings that match more than one extension that you are looking for. For example, if the string wiki matches multiple extensions that you are looking for, you can filter the contents of list.txt to match wiki and save a little bit of time. In https://extdist.wmflabs.org/dist/extensions/ there are five links that contain both 1_25 and wiki and you can find all five links with two pattern matches.\n\nA: No, it's impossible with wildcards.

Of course, you won't manage to use 2 X Screens, and for me Xinerama didn't work.\nI got mine to work (1 screen on each GPU) by not specicifically referencing the second GPU. I (however) am using 2 nVidia GTS 450s, and 2 identical screens, so you may struggle with that method.\nHere is what you need for an xorg.conf file:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\nThis sets up the layout. Note how we only have 1 screen (with the location 0,0) and Xinerama is disabled (set to \"0\").\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nThis is the section for your mouse and keyboard. Your xorg.conf file (if it exists) should already have this. If not, just use this. It should work, as this seems to be a default.\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Acer S220HQL\"\n    HorizSync       31.0 - 82.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nThe monitor section is likely to be different for you - keep the name the same, and leave DPMS alone, but the Name and the HorizSync / VertRefresh will probably be different for you.\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce 450 GTS\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:1:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nNow I tell it my GPU exists. This may be the issue for you, and I think(?) your GPUs are different. Anyway, the key for me was only to tell it that there is one GPU.\nSection \"Screen\"\n\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"Stereo\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder\" \"CRT-0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"GPU-56281125-01c7-ee85-b8b9-b3e5cf94b7c5.GPU-0.DVI-I-0: 1920x1080 +0+180, GPU-cbc59e3f-e8c1-a347-a069-b62f6b885f7d.GPU-1.DVI-I-0: 1920x1080 +1680+180\"\n    Option         \"MultiGPU\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"SLI\" \"off\"\n    Option         \"BaseMosaic\" \"on\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nFinally, the screen section. This is where the second GPU appears. I don't know what the 56281125-01c7-ee85-b8b9-b3e5cf94b7c5 means, and this may just be a name. The 1920x1080 is your screen resolution, and the +1680+180 is really confusing, but essentially positions it. Why it's 1680 I don't know.\nMultiGPU is off, as is SLI, but BaseMosaic is on. I guess the Depth is the colour depth.\nI've stuck this all together in a paste bin, here for you.\n\nA: I'm afraid I do most things in the GUI, and not the CLI, where possible, but here is how I solved a similar problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly plug in and switch on the monitor (as I'm sure you're doing,\nbut the order is important).\n\n*Open the Application 'Screen Display'\n\n*Press the button 'Detect Displays'\n\n*From there your second monitor should be ready for use, and it is just a matter of setting it up to suit your requirements.  I searched for how to do this here in ask Ubuntu and ended up using Compiz Manager to force applications to the second screen using a keyboard short-cut.\n\n\nA: Screen 0 is behaviour of Ubuntu, when inproper or none (standard) graphical driver is present.\nIn general for this situation is necessary to install additional drivers. For Nvidia drivers you have to search for additional drivers in Ubuntu software center - settings - software sources - additional drivers // english names in menu are not exact. \nAs you have Radeon card, you can follow already answered question here: How to install drivers for AMD Radeon HD 7850?\n", "Q: Reinstalling Ubuntu without formatting /home, BACKUP specific config files? I've got /home & /(filesystem) on separate partitions. I've upgraded a few times (xubuntu) but my OS has picked up the inevitable fud over the years & I want to do a fresh install.\nTo do a fresh install of / and keep home as is, use this method.\nThe only difference is that I don't want to ditch all of / without having the opportunity to back useful stuff up, in case I can selectively re-apply stuff or whatever. Does anyone have a guide to what to back up (if anything) from / ? All I can find is guides to back up the whole thing, which I don't want.\nSimilarly is there an obvious way of saving a list of your installed programs or is it just the 'screenshots of programs menu' method?\nThanks\n(note to mods: tags 're-installation' and 'software-installation' aren't allowed under the \"installation tag not allowed\" rule, even though they exist as alternatives. This is surely a bug)\n\nA: To keep list of packages installed in the old system, you can do :\napt --installed list\n\nor \ndpkg --list\n\nand redirect it into some file in home filesystem. Then if you want to back-up some subdirectories in / directory, you can use tar with appropriate parameters. I recommend to back-up /etc. Also some logs in /var/log might be useful for future comparison with the new system. If you have small / filesystem and you want to back up the whole / filesystem, then use tar with parameter --one-file-system .\n\nA: Backuping your root\nGet the root partition device, using mount :\n$ mount\n[...]\n/dev/sdXY on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)\n[...]\n\nMount it on another directory (replace /dev/sdXY using your partition):\n$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/root\n$ sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/root\n\nCopy it to another partition, without file permission changes (in the example, I'll use /home):\n$ sudo cp -rfp /mnt/root/ /home/old_root\n\nGetting all installed programs\nI think that the best way to get this is observing the list of installed packages. In Ubuntu, the program instalation in most cases is done with packages, if you reinstall the package of the corresponding program, you will get the program back.\nTo get the list of the instaled packages:\n$ dpkg -l |grep ^ii\n\nIf you wanna save it in a file, you can add > path/to/file in this command. For example:\n$ dpkg -l |grep ^ii > /home/user/package_list\n\n", "Q: Google Chrome security I have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nWhen I first open Google Chrome I get the green padlock, but any sites I visit I get your connection is not private.\nI then check the connection and it has 2 warnings:\nThe website identity has not been verified. \n\nand \nYour connection to [Whatever website] is not encrypted. \n\nI've checked everything in the settings.

If I were you, I would:\nTake a file back-up of all my files, delete the partition and then re-create the partition and restore the files.\nFor more info read here for user type 4.\n\nA: At first, you need to unmount the partition. (It is shown mounted in the screenshot above). In the Gparted window, Right Click on the selected partition /dev/sdb1 and click \"Unmount\".\nHere, you can do two things:\n\n*\n\n*Shrink Partition: To do this, Right click on selected partition and click resize, then drag the partition marker to the left. you will be left with unallocated space in the right, which you can use to make another partition on the device.\n\nNOTE: as you said that you met a system shutdown during partition resize and this one happened. There is a possibility that you have already lost one partition. Usually, /dev/sdb1 should appear before /dev/sdb2 in the partition list.\n\n\n*Grow Partition: To do this, Right click on selected partition and click \"Check\". It will merge the unallocated space to the same partition i.e. /dev/sdb2.\n\nIn general, Grow is considered safe than Shrink.\n\nA: I came across similar problem with ext4 filesystem after a normal Ubuntu installation. I found the answer in this link - How to grow filesystem to use unallocated space in partition\nAs per recommendation in the above link, \"See the man page for resize2fs (which is the command-line tool gparted will use to grow an ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystem) for more details about resizing those filesystems.\"\nAs also stated in one of the posts, \"Simply use sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1 etc.,even while the filesystem is mounted, to grow it to the partition size.\" \n", "Q: Run the script with screen I write a script to run p2pool.

With pip I'm able to do --no-check-certificate. \nHow can I do this for adding PPAs? \n\nA: There's no option to disable checking of certificates for add-apt-repository, and the URL is hard-coded. You can change it, but it will be lost the next time python3-software-properties is upgraded.

You can fetch the key yourself. So, you can add the PPA manually. For example, for the GNOME3 PPA, expand the section named Technical details about this PPA. You'll see something like this:\n\nThe URL seen there is what you actually need. Using it, you can add the repository yourself:\nprintf \"%s http://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome3-team/gnome3/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main\\n\" deb deb-src | \n  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gnome3-ppa.list\n\nClick on the link underneath Signing Key, and you'll be taken to the GPG key for this repo. If the link doesn't work because of a firewall/proxy, etc. (it's on a non-standard port), you can go to http://keyserver.ubuntu.com, and manually search for 0x3B1510FD (0x followed by the key fingerprint), select the public key (aka pub), and copy the text from the begin line to the end. Then do:\nsudo apt-key add - \n\nand paste the key. Press Enter and CtrlD to complete adding the key.

But the device isn't recognized as a mouse, it is listed as \"unknown\".\n\nI'm on Ubuntu 14.04\nAny help would be great.\n\nA: In the file /usr/share/gnome-bluetooth/pin-code-database.xml add the line:\n<device oui=\"DC:7E:AA:\" type=\"mouse\" name=\"Microsoft Designer Mouse\" pin=\"0000\"/>\n\njust below the line:\n<device oui=\"7C:1E:52:\" type=\"mouse\" name=\"Microsoft Touch Mouse\" pin=\"0000\"/>\n\n\nInformation about the bluetooth connections for bluez version 4 is stored\nin files in directory /var/lib/bluetooth/.\nThe basic problem with 14.04 is that the link key may not be added to the\nlinkkeys file when the mouse is paired, so the connection is not really\ncomplete.  The pairing (for version 4) should create entries in the \"names\"\nand \"trusts\" files, and an entry with a link key in the\n/var/lib/bluetooth/<host bt addr>/linkkeys file.  The mouse address entries\ndo get created in the \"names\" and \"trusts\" files, but not in the \"linkkeys\"\nfile IF IT IS NOT ALREADY PRESENT.

Hi  now I'm using Ubuntu using flash memory without install it , And I  installed some program & downloaded  some files. If I turn the PC off will I lose my  data or if I install the system now will I lose the data ? \n\nA: Yes, the LiveCD runs in a ramdisk which means that when shutting the computer off that all data will be lost. However, you can save this data to an external device (i.e. flash drive or if you wanted maybe Dropbox).

Another thread advises against setting allow_writeable_chroot=YES for security reasons, namely to mitigate a \"ROARING BEAST ATTACK\".\nSetting allow_writeable_chroot=YES means that vsftpd should allow the situation where the user's home directory is writeable by that user.  Instead for security reasons I changed the permissions on the user's root folder from 777 to 555.\n\nOriginal: drwxrwxrwx /home/ftpuser/\nChanged to: dr-xr-xr-x /home/ftpuser/\n\nThis made the user's home directory NOT writeable by the user and thus I didn't have to use the allow_writeable_chroot=YES parameter.  This is fine (and more secure) for my situation as I have a preset directory structure and don't want the user making new files or directories in their root folder anyways.\nI figured this out when I switched the home directory to /var/ftp via the local_root=[path] parameter for vsftpd and it worked without having to set allow_writeable_chroot=YES.  This folder /var/ftp is (755) but owned by root and thus not writeable by ftpuser.\n\nA: Weirdly for me this issue cropped up when trying to ls after logging in.\nIt turned out to be that I had uninstalled httpd in favour of nginx and the folder I was using was owned apache:apache and the user got removed when I removed httpd.\nI chcon'd the directories to nginx:nginx and then replaced the user in these lines in my config file:\n\nguest_username=nginx\nnopriv_user=nginx\n\nHopefully this helps someone out there because the error messages weren't helpful at all.\n\nA: I found so many confusing answers.

On Ubuntu, the string returned by uname -r is always of the form x.y.0-z-generic (i.e., 3.19.0-21-generic). Compiling Ubuntu's kernel ends up with a string that is of the form x.y.z (i.e., 3.19.8), the actual version of the kernel that is used. What does the z represent in the first case? Is that the EXTRAVERSION parameter or is it something else? How do I get the version string of my build of Ubuntu to match the official one?\n\nA: It is the ABI number. The following link should help answer your question: \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/KernelMaintenance \nFrom the Kernel/FAQ:\nWhat differentiates the Ubuntu Kernel from the upstream Linux Kernel?\nUbuntu kernels are rebased against stable releases only through the development cycle, with many patches on top of the stable tag. Once the final release is made the master branch is never rebased again. While stable updates (post release) are usually applied, we sometimes make patch decisions that are counter to the stable releases. \nSo, the best one could say is that Ubuntu kernels are only loosely based on upstream stable. You'd have to examine the changelog to know exactly what goes into a particular kernel. \nWith every Ubuntu kernel release, we attempt to remain as true to the upstream Linux kernel as possible. However, there are inevitable patches which we carry on top of the upstream Linux kernel which differentiates the Ubuntu kernel from the upstream Linux kernel. This document attempts to describe the general set of patches which are carried and why: Kernel/FAQ/UbuntuDelta\nWhat does a specific Ubuntu kernel version number mean?\nThe official version of an Ubuntu kernel tells you a number of things, including the base upstream version, the current Ubuntu ABI identifier and the kernel flavour. (See How can we determine the version of the running kernel? to find your current version number.)\nGiven a version like 2.6.35-6.9-generic this can be broken into four parts as below:\n<base kernel version>-<ABI number>.<upload number>-<flavour>\n\nThe base kernel version represents the mainline version on which the Ubuntu kernel is based. The ABI number represents significant changes in the kernel Application Binary Interface. The upload number is a monotonically increasing counter for each upload of this base version. The flavour indicates which kernel configuration variant this is (See What is a Kernel Flavour?).\nHow can we determine the version of the running kernel?\nThe official version of an Ubuntu kernel is found in the /proc/version_signature file. This file contains both the full Ubuntu version of the kernel and the mainline version on which it is based. The first field is always Ubuntu, the second field is the Ubuntu kernel version, and the final field is the upstream version:\n$ cat /proc/version_signature\nUbuntu 2.6.35-6.9-generic 2.6.35-rc3\n$\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to change the position of the top menu bar?

I'm rather new to the Linux environment and have learned how to install software via using following commands\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build \n$ cmake\n$ sudo make install.\n\nI noticed that there is a build of the software usually in /build/src and then many of the same files are also in the home directory of the software. There's also an install usually in /usr/local/bin and others. My question is, in an effort to save disk space, what can I delete after I've compiled and installed software in this way? I installed FSlint but afraid to start deleting duplicates. Sorry for this very noob question. \n\nA: don't try to delete anything inside / directory by your self there.  In linux file system hierarchy there is\n/bin Common programs, shared by the system, the system administrator and the users.\n/sbin it contains the executable which requires the root permission to execute\n/lib contains the libraries required for the installed programs\n/usr Programs, libraries, documentation etc. for all user-related programs.\n/usr/bin contains all the programs you have installed and other programs\nif you want to get some free space you can do\n$ sudo apt-get autoremove\n$ sudo apt-get clean\n\nthese commands will remove the cached packages and unused packages\nAfter you have finished compiling and installing you can remove the source code of the program and other files in the same directory from where you have compiled the program \n\nA: the software that you configure, make, make install can generally have the source dirs cleaned up.  They should install everything they need as long as the installer was built properly.  I'd suggest moving the dir that you compiled in and testing functionality before deleting.\nAll of that work should be done in a src dir, normally the /usr/src, or even better in the user's home dir create a src.\nNow the stuff in the rest of the file system should be the components of an installed package, executables in the bin dirs, data in the etc dirs, the equivelent of dlls in the lib dirs.\nhere is a link to the wiki page with the basics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard if you want to know more\n", "Q: Accessing Ubuntu terminal of a system outside LAN, but connected to internet I know how to access remote terminal of an Ubuntu machine from a Windows machine using PuTTY when both the machines are part of same LAN. \nIs it possible to use the same method for two machines connected over the Internet?\nI searched the Internet for an answer, but had less luck finding what I need. \nIt will be useful if someone could answer or point-out a link.\n\nA: You will need to set port-forwarding on the router that connects you to the internet.\nfor example (choose a port number yourself):\nport 10022 on the router, forwarded to port 22 of your ubuntu ip.\n(I would use a port > 10000 because some providers block standard ports, and 10022 reminds me it's ssh.)\nThen find out your 'internet ip', with  http://whatismyip.com\nFrom somewhere else on the internet, then you can putty or ssh to that 'internet ip' on port 10022. What will be forwarded by your router to port 22 of your ubuntu ip.\nSo you will need to figure out how to configure that on your router.

In very short, as noted in the question BackInTime seems to have lost my backup profiles -- or perhaps more accurately, is not able to pull information about the profiles from its config file as detailed below.\nTo jump to the question: Is there a way to somehow force BiT to read the config file and re-create(?) the profile(s) in the GUI?\nAnyways, to the description / full account:\nHere's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created the Main profile in the BackInTime GUI with all info added (Included, Excluded folders / file types, etc configurations).\n\n\n*Took three successful snapshots with the profile. \n\n\n*Created a second backup profile.\n\n*Rebooted my computer in anticipation of taking a snapshot with the second profile as the system had accumulated 15 GB cache per system monitor during the three runs of the Main profile and it seemed a bit sluggish. (I should perhaps add that this installation doesn't shut down fully properly so I need to force close the computer by long-pressing the power button. Systems booted up ok nevertheless as usual.)\n\n*Started up BackInTime again -- but had forgotten to mount my external USB3-connected backup location (which is ext4).\n\n*BiT gave a prompt noting that my destination is on a removable media and not attached. Asked to attach/mount it and click ok. Which I did. \nNow, finally:\n\n*BiT shows essentially a blank screen. As if I would have just started it for the first time.\n\n\nSome additional notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*My BiT's config file at ~/.config/backintime/config seems just fine. (I've copy-pasted it at the bottom of this question.)\n\n*After exiting and restarting BiT 2-3 times and then rebooting my computer, opening up BiT again and then noticing the Refresh snapshot list (as shown below) I was able to get BiT list the snapshots I have taken \n\n... but\n\n*BiT is still not seeing any of my configurations\n\n*Consequently, BiT is not showing anything in the Shortcuts or Name windows. \n\nI'm a bit clueless in how I could troubleshoot this further. I've tried to search the web for things like \"Ubuntu Back In Time lost backup profile\" etc but haven't really found anything that would get me ahead. I've rebooted the computer again but the profile details (that still exist in the config file just doesn't get pulled into BiT.\nAll/any advice would be much appreciated!\nEDIT: I'm running Ubuntu 15.04 amd64 in a dual-boot setup (w/ the other boot being Win7, not that it would matter AFAIK). This is a few days old installation and I installed BiT from Ubuntu Software Center. Its version is 1.0.36. Rsync version is 3.1.1  protocol version 31. As noted in my text my Ubuntu installation isn't totally perfect as it's not shutting down properly but needs to be force-closed with long-pressing the power button. I don't understand Linux well enough that I would understand if that causes problems -- e.g. for saving created profiles' information as might be the issue here. All of the at least 20 software that I've installed and tried seem to run pretty ok, though. I haven't had any problems with other configurations not being saved, to be specific (in relation to this problem).\n\nMy BackInTime ~/.config/backintime/config file

Your second profile is missing a name. I'm not sure how this could happen because I double checked in BIT source and it should refuse to create a new profiles without name. Anyways, please run echo \"profile2.name=Second Profile\" | tee -a ~/.config/backintime/config to fix this.\nEdit\nBackInTime version 1.1.6 (planned to release next week) will avoid this by using a default profile name if the value is missing.\n\nRegarding 4.\nYou should never switch of your machine by holding power button. This can lead to disc corruption as files doesn't get written directly to your hdd. They are cached in RAM. Only a clean dismount would make sure that all files have been written to hdd.\nTo avoid this but switch off your machine after it crashed you can press and hold ALT + PRINT and type (while holding) REISUB\nDisclaimer: I'm member of BIT-Dev Team\n", "Q: Revert python installation I am using ubuntu precise.

You can see all of its dependencies with dpkg --status ubuntu-mate-desktop | grep '^Depends:' or online.\nIf you are to remove one of the dependencies in that list, the meta-package does not any longer have all of its dependencies and must also be removed in order to have a consistent package-graph.\nConsequences: If the meta-package is uninstalled, since it is only a meta-package, it wont do much, but, since you don’t have the meta-package any more, any additions to the meta-package (new dependencies) will not affect your system any more. So a dist-upgrade won’t add new applications to your Ubuntu installation if they are added to it.\nThe addition of new packages often happens when doing a release upgrade. \nSo your system might be good as long as you are using 15.04, but I would reinstall the meta-package before eventually upgrading to 15.10.\nAlso, the meta-package is the package, that marks a dependency to other packages.\nIn earlier versions of Ubuntu, apt-get autoremove could accidentally mark packages, that is not installed directly, as unused, thus marking them for uninstallation. This should have been fixed in 15.04, so it will probably not affect you.\nYou can read more about meta-packages.\n", "Q: How to run xrandr commands at startup in Ubuntu How can I run the following xrandrcommand on startup?\nxrandr \ncvt 1368 768 \nxrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1368x768_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1368x768_60.00 \n\n\nA: Create the file ~/.xprofile and put your lines in it. It is ran at the beginning of the X user session.\n\nA: Adding complicated commands to Startup Applications\nIn General, you can add commands to run on start up (log in) by choosing: Dash > Startup Applications > Add. In this case, you have a complicated command to run. \nThere are two options to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*write a separate script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncvt 1368 768 \n# xrandr only works in X11 sessions, not Wayland\n[ \"$XDG_SESSION_TYPE\" = x11 ] || exit 0\nxrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1368x768_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1368x768_60.00\n\nCopy the script into an empty file, save it as set_monitor.sh\nand add the following command to startup applications as described above.\n/bin/bash /path/to/set_monitor.sh\n\n\n*Chain the commands to one (very long) command: \n /bin/bash -c \"cvt 1368 768&&xrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync&&xrandr --addmode VGA1 1368x768_60.00&&xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1368x768_60.00\"\n\nIn this case, using && between the commands will make each command run as soon (and if) the previous one is run succesfully, just like they are on separate lines.\nThen add the command to Startup Applications, as described above.\nImportant note: adding xrandr commands to Startup Applications\nAdding xrandr commands to startup can be tricky; sometimes they break if they are run too early, before the desktop is fully loaded. Therefore you might (probably) need to add a little break into the command to (either) run the script or the command, like (in the last case):\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15&&cvt 1368 768&&xrandr --newmode \"1368x768_60.00\"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync&&xrandr --addmode VGA1 1368x768_60.00&&xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1368x768_60.00\"\n\nYou might need to play a little with the sleep 15to find the optimal time.\nNote\nI left out the first line:\nxrandr\n\nsince it does nothin but display some information on your screen setup :)\n\nA: According to this at the Now automate it on login section, I have made my own script 45custom_xrandr-settings and placed it into /etc/X11/Xsession.d/. It works fine for me under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

If so you can insert it and try \nagain. \n\nRetry mounting the CD-ROM? \n<YES>                          <NO>\n\nSo to fix this, I would need to open another terminal using: Alt + f2. \nNow if I write df -h, I get this following results: \nnone  382.6M    100.0K    382.4M    0%   /run\ndevtmpfs   1.9M    0      1.9G      0%   /dev\n/dev/sdb1  29.0G   1.6G   27.4G     6%   /media\n\nNow I just have to run 2 commands, to get everything working: \numount /dev/sdb1\nmount /dev/sdb1 /cdrom\n\nNow if I go back to the question: Retry mounting the CD-ROM? and answer YES, \nEverything runs smoothly and it install my ubuntu server 14.04 flawlessly. \nQuestion: I really need to make it unattended, is there a workaround here so I don't have to umount and mount again? Should I just give static IP-addresses and use boot over network instead? \nThis is not a virtual machine, in VM it works fine without problems. \nI have motherboard with APU and 1 wiped harddrive using GParted quick erase.

Nor did I find a solution to my problem online. \nCan anyone tell me what is wrong?\n\nA: I had a related problem. Spyder (version 2.2.5) crashed. I tried to reopen it after rebooting my computer, but nothing happened- clicking on the symbol in the launcher did nothing, also just typing \nspyder\n\nin a command line did not result in the GUI being fired up, it also did not result in an error message. However, typing\nspyder --new-instance\n\nresulted in the GUI being fired up.\nLooking into the file \nstart_app.py\n\nin the directory \n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/spyderlib/\n\nit became clear the the following lines of code were the problem:\nif CONF.get('main', 'single_instance') and not options.new_instance \\\n  and not mac_app:\n    # Minimal delay (0.1-0.2 secs) to avoid that several\n    # instances started at the same time step in their\n    # own foots while trying to create the lock file\n    time.sleep(random.randrange(1000, 2000, 90)/10000.)\n\n    # Lock file creation\n    lockf = get_conf_path('spyder.lock')\n    lock = lockfile.FilesystemLock(lockf)\n\n    # lock.lock() tries to lock spyder.lock.

If you know what the erroneous lines are supposed to say, you can simply change them.\nSince i did not, I simply deleted my entire .spyder2 folder. It was then created anew when i did sudo apt-get purge spyder && sudo apt-get install spyder. \nSimply doing sudo apt-get purge spyder or sudo apt-get install --reinstall spyder won't work since it doesn't affect your personal configuration file. You have to either repair or delete the .spyder.ini manually.\n\nA: I had the same problem. When I tried to open Spyder from terminal, I got following error message:\nConfigParser.ParsingError: File contains parsing errors: /home/.spyder2/spyder.ini\n    [line 55]: 'font/italic'\n\nMy solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the spyder.ini file using nano /home/.spyder2/spyder.ini\n\n*Then delete the [line 55]: 'font/italic'\n\n*Save the file\nDone! I could open Spyder.\n\nA: This is a development on the fix proposed by Wilhelm Braun. \nIn my case, I did not get any error message. Simply and silently, Spyder 2.2.5 was not starting off, whether I used the command line or the desktop menu.\nThe command l ~/.spyder2 showed a dangling (red-coloured) symlink spyder.lock@. \nDeleting this file made Spyder start as expected. \n", "Q: How to download ubuntu to harddisk?

The reason is that you can never unmount the partition running the system, since the system can't unmount itself. For the same reason, simply booting in recovery mode isn't enough.\n", "Q: Will resizing ext4 partitions with Windows destroy the installed Ubuntu? As the title says, can I use Windows (7) to resize the ext4 partition Ubuntu is installed on? I dual-boot both Win7 and Ubuntu and want to enlarge the Ubuntu root partition. Is it safe to do this from Windows which does not recognize the ext4 filesystem, but sees the partition, or will I have to boot from a (sloooow) Ubuntu live-DVD?\n\nA: There are really two issues here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resizing the partition\n\n*Resizing the filesystem\n\n\nPeople mostly refer to \"resizing the partition\" because that implies also resizing the filesystem, but in the case of your question, understanding the answer requires understanding the distinction between the two.\nPartitions are very simple data structures that define the start and end points of chunks of the disk. Filesystems, by contrast, are complex data structures that are defined relative to the start of the data structures that contain them. Note that a filesystem is conventionally contained by a partition, but it could be contained in a file, on a whole disk, in an LVM's logical volume, etc.\nBecause filesystems are laid out relative to their starting point, it's possible to safely move the end point of a partition upward even if the tools used to do this don't understand the filesystem. It's also completely pointless to do this, since the filesystem's own data structures will not magically expand to fill the available space. Moving the end point of the partition down is likely to be disastrous, since important files might be stored at the end of the filesystem -- and even if they aren't, the filesystem data structures will still indicate that the filesystem is the same size it originally was, so the OS might try to store files beyond the (new) end of the partition, which will be disastrous. Moving the start point of a partition without adjusting the filesystem will be even more disastrous, since then the OS won't be able to detect the filesystem at all. (Note that I've used the word \"disastrous\" three times in this paragraph, not counting in this parenthetical statement.)\nSimilarly, it's possible to shrink a filesystem without doing any damage to it (assuming the shrinking operation works correctly, which is not guaranteed), but it will then be smaller than its containing partition. Growing it (if it's already properly sized for its containing partition) is impossible -- or at least, any competently-written tool will refuse to do so.\nI haven't checked the source code, but chances are GParted relies on underlying tools to resize the partition and filesystem separately, but in the correct order to keep things accessible and proper. For instance, to grow a partition from the end, it would increase the partition size and then increase the filesystem size to match.\nGetting back to your question, there are certainly Windows tools that can resize partitions. In theory, an ext4fs resizing tool could be written for Windows. In fact, it's conceivable that resize2fs (the tool that does the job in Linux) has already been ported to Windows. If so, you could do the job from Windows -- but AFAIK, there's no easy-to-use GUI front-end for the job. Thus, I don't recommend even trying. It actually is possible to resize an ext4fs partition while it's in use, but only if the start point is not moved. This also requires using text-mode commands. In most cases it's easier (and safer, especially for relative novices) to use a live medium to run GParted.\nAlso, the slowness of a DVD-based Ubuntu is a trivial thing compared to the risks and, depending on what you're doing, the time involved in resizing a partition. In particular, if you move the start point of a partition, that will take a lot of time, since such an operation involves moving a lot of data.\nAs an alternative, you might consider creating a new partition from the space you use in shrinking the one(s) you want to shrink. Once you know the size, you can move some existing data there and mount the new partition in your Ubuntu directory tree. See, for instance:\nHow can I move my /home directory to another partition if it's already part of the / partition?\nDepending on the sizes, /home might not be the best thing to move; you might end up moving /var, /home/yourname/Videos, or something else, but the principle's the same.\n\nA: \nIs it safe to do this from Windows which does not recognize the ext4 filesystem ...\n\nOMGNoooo!!!\nPartitions are still largely physically determined. If you have files outside the new boundaries of a partition, something needs to move it. Additionally the filesystem itself needs to know how big it is.\nUsing something that doesn't understand EXT4 will likely ruin the filesystem either partially or completely. Windows will destroy your filesystem and enslave your children.\nUse a LiveCD to make offline changes. If that's too slow, use a fast USB stick instead. Either is faster than having to rescue your data and reinstall Ubuntu.\n\nA: There's not an iota of a chance that your ext4 partition will survive.\nEven the slightest touch from windows Disk Management will undo any ubuntu partition.\nMake no mistake, Windows will not play nice in a multi os system.\n"]
